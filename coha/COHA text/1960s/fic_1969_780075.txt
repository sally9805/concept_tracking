 | The pitchman counted , nudging the balls from the holes , and consulted the card . I had made two more points . Michael laughed . Rachel gave me an uncertain smile . I tossed the balls again and made half a point . On the next toss , the five dollars Michael stood to win with the radio became ten dollars , and the cost of each toss went up from fifty cents to one dollar . I felt my annoyance at Michael begin to disappear , and I tossed the balls once again . The ten dollars became twenty dollars , and the one dollar became two dollars . Michael put two dollars on the counter next to the lacquered board . I was playing seriously now and I clicked the balls together inside the dice cup and tossed them onto the board , then leaned forward , watching the swift count of the pitchman .

He appeared to be in his late sixties or early seventies , and he stood a few feet behind Michael , leaning on a cane and watching us . I clicked the balls together and tossed them onto the hoard . They scattered wildly across the lacquered surface , some finding holes , some falling against the frame . The pitchman nudged the balls from the holes as he counted , then consulted the card .

Instead she looked at the pitchman , as if pleading with him to stop the game . He stook very still behind the counter , saying nothing . " Play , " Michael said loudly . I had had enough .

The pitchman replaced it with a new one-dollar bill which he took from the cigar box on the shelf . looked at Rachel . She seemed unable to speak . Michael picked up the dice cup and tossed the balls . The pitclunan consulted the card . " Double again , " he said , sounding surprised and very unhappy . You two got a lucky streak going .

" I should not have let you play this long . " I lc ignored her . " Lend me some money , Reuven . " Behind Michael , the old man lifted his cane and came toward us to the booth . I thought he wanted to play and I moved aside . Instead he walked past me , raised the drop-leaf attached to the counter , went into the booth , and let the drop-leaf fall behind him .

The old man stood behind the counter and put his hands on the board . He seemed an aged duplicate of the pitchman . He had sparse gray hair and dark eyes set in deep sockets . His cheekbones were more pronounced than those of the pitchman , the cheeks hollower , the skin sallow on his face , dry and papery on his hands , and  | like wrinkled cloth on his neck . He wore a white long-sleeved silk shirt , sharply pressed trousers , a red bow tie , and a red vest . Standing side by side inside the small booth , the two of them looked to be father and son . The old man peered at me out of his deep-socketed eyes and tapped a long , thin finger against the lacquered board . " I am the owner , " he announced . His voice was hoarse , almost hollow , as if burned out from shouting into the noise of too many carnival nights . He looked at me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is your wife ?

" Young man , " he said , smiling and tapping a finger ( against the lacquered board , " you have a friend here . " # He pointed to himself . " You understand ? You have a friend he ' ' ' re . Go ahead . Schmeiss ! " His hand struck the counter with a light , slapping sound . I stared at him in amazement and disbelief . The tension of the game was suddenly gone .

" And he winked his right eye and nodded his head , I saw Rachel 's face flood with relief . But Michael continued to regard him narrowly , his eyes strangely suspicious . A moist night wind blew along the asphalt road , carrying the  | odors of hot ' popcorn and broiling meat . I heard the roar of the roller coaster and turned and saw a car hurtle down a grade , then wove slowly up a steep incline and disappear over the crest . A man laden with prizes bumped heavily into Rachel , almost knocking her down . Clutching his prizes , he muttered an apology and went on up the road . I heard a gong and the crack of a rifle and shouts , Intl then the roller coaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Hie three of us were standing right up against the counter now , looking at the old man .

Rachel here , and Michael , live in Crown Heights . " I spoke slowly , using my halting Yiddish . " In Williamsburg , " he said , and smiled deeply . " With all the I Iasidim ? " " That 's right .

What is the girl studying ? " " English literature , " Rachel said . Her eyes were still bright with the look of delight and relief they had taken on at the old man 's first words iii Yiddish.  | " English literature . " He echoed the words mechanically . " Where in Russia are you from ? " Rachel asked in English . She understood Yiddish but could not speak it . " Mogilev , " he said . " You have heard of Kishinev ? " Rachel and I nodded .

" " Thousands came that way , " he said in Yiddish . " Thousands . " I Ie was quiet for a moment . " I found work in a carnival . In Russia I went to a great yeshiva , and in America I work in a carnival . " He shrugged . " One must make a living , " he said sadly . " Here you can not live off others . " He looked at me .

" He teaches Jewish philosophy at the Zechariah Frankel Seminary , " I said . " Have you heard of my father ? " Michael asked , still speaking in Yiddish.  | " What is his name ? " " Abraham Gordon .

Behind him the pitchman stood very still , staring down at the gleaming radio . The old man was quiet a long time , his eyes moist and sad . He shook his head slowly . " Nu , " he said . " Back to business . You are in good hands here now . " He had reverted to English . " Schmeiss , " he said , smiling . " See how much you will win from me . " I felt calm and protected . The tension and fear were gone now from the game . I put seven dollars on the counter next to the one-dollar bill . " Go ahead and play , " I said to Michael . " I 'll pay and you 'll play . All right ? " Michael grinned eagerly and picked up the cup . Rachel nodded , her eyes very bright . " Go ahead , " I said . " Play . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with excitement , then turned the cup over . The balls spilled onto the lacquered board and the fingers of the old man 's right hand poked the balls from the holes as he counted aloud in Yiddish , " Nine , seventeen , twenty-one , thirty-one , thirty-five , forty-one . " He looked at the card , smiled at Michael , and said in English , " Half a point . " I felt my heart racing wildly and put eight dollars down on the counter . Michael spilled the balls onto the board . The old man counted swiftly and consulted the card . His face fell . " AIL " he said sadly . " That is a shame . " He was talking in Yiddish again and seemed quite upset . " There is no credit for thirty-eight . Such a shame . " We stared at him .  | " So it goes , " he said in Yiddish , smiling at us sadly . " It is a game , and you do not win every time . But it is only another half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the counter . Michael did not bother clicking the balls together this time . He simply turned the cup over and let the balls spill out onto the lacquered board . They added up to twenty-nine . On the card , twenty-nine had printed next to it the word " Double . " The old man smiled and shook his head happily . " You see ? " he said . " I promised you are in good hands . " He removed one of the twenty-dollar bills and replaced it with a new one-hundred-dollar bill . On top of the radio there now lay one hundred and sixty dollars . " Is it sixteen dollars a toss ? " I heard Rachel ask in a faint voice . " Sixteen dollars , " the old man said , nodding . I felt myself sweating . Michael stood very still , holding the dice cup limply in his hand . " I have eleven dollars left , " I said to Rachel . My voice was dry . She hesitated , looked for a long moment at the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress and came up with five dollars . I put the money on the counter . " This is our last try , " I said to the old man . He smiled reassuringly . " This time how can you lose ? " he said . " Go ahead , " I said to Michael . Michael blinked nervously . Very slowly , as if it no longer mattered to him whether he won or lost , he raised the dice cup and turned it over on top of the board . The balls dribbled from the cup almost one by one , rolling across the lacquered surface , only three finding their way into the red holes , the rest falling against the frame . The hand of the old man moved swiftly , knocking the balls from their holes . " Nineteen , " he said . He looked at the card . Then he looked at Michael . " Ah , " he said , smiling sympathetically . " That is a terrible shame . Nineteen is no credit . " Michael stood frozen , staring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand . The balls had rolled into the holes very slowly this time , slowly  | enough for mc to have been able to see the black numbers beneath the holes into which they had fallen . There had been a one , a three , and a six . On the card , the number ten offered two points . I looked at Michael and realized that he too had been able to - count the numbers . I saw Rachel stare at Michael . Her eves were filled with fear again . " ' ' hat was a ten , " Michael said , his voice trembling . " I counted tcan . ' I'he pitchman came forward and stood next to the old man behind the counter . The old man blinked his deep-socketed eyes and smiled pleasantly . " Ten is two points , " Michael said . " I won the radio and the money . " " Excuse me , " the old man said quietly , still smiling . " It was nineteen . " " No , it was n't , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It could n't have been .

" The numbers were one , three , and six . " The old man looked at me . He was suddenly no longer smiling . " Ah , " he said , " you are a mathematician too . From a rabbi you became a mathematician . Very nice . It was a ten , a three , and a six . Not a one , but a ten . " " It was a one , " I said . " Reuven , " Rachel said very quietly . " Just a minute , " I told her . I looked at the old man . " Which hole did it land in ? " " Listen , " the old man said . " You want to play again ? If you want to play again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play again , the game is over . " That was a ten , " Michael repeated , his thin voice rising .  | " Young man , do n't cause trouble . I know how to count . You think I do n't know how to count ? " " You 're damn right you know how to count , " I said , beginning to feel the anger rise up inside me . The old man shook his head and sighed sadly . " Always it ends like this . Always . Who likes to lose ? But I did not expect it from vou . " That was a one , a three , and a six , " I said again . " It landed in that hole right there , and that 's a one , not a ten . " The old man sighed again and turned to the pitchman . " What was it ? " he asked . " What did you count ? " " Nineteen , " the pitchman said . " You see ? " said the old man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was a one , " Michael said . " I saw it . It was a one .

Just like that . He lost , but still he wants the radio . " He looked intently at Michael . " Young man , you can play again if you want . If not , move away from the counter . " " I won that radio , " Michael said defiantly . " You won nothing . You are missing half a point . Are you playing ? " " I have n't any more money , " Rachel said faintly . F - So you are not playing . So move away from the counter . You hear ? Move away from the counter . You are keeping away other customers .

I felt the blood rush to my head . My legs were trembling .  | " Out ! " the old man shouted , waving the cane . " Out ! Play or get out ! " " I.ct him play it again , " I said , swallowing the rage in my voice . " Call it a miscount and let him play it once more . " " Listen to the rabbi , " the old man shouted . He turned to the pitchman . " Did you ever hear such a thing ? For free he should play . " Ile turned back to me . " I 'm in business , " he shouted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give you something for nothing ? Go away ! Take your friends away ! Do n't start trouble here . Get out , all of you ! " I took a deep , tremulous breath . " Reuven , please let 's go , " Rachel said . " Come on , " I said to Michael , taking his arm . " Let 's get out of here . " Michael pulled his arm away . His face was ashen . There was a strange dead look in his eyes . " I was n't watching , " he said very quietly , his lips trembling . " Usually I 'm watching and I can tell when ? " He broke off . " I trusted you and I was n't watching . " I stared at him . " Why did you do that ? " Michael asked , staring at the old man . The old man looked at him out of narrowed eyes and said nothing . " You 're like all the others , " Michael said . There was a flat , toneless quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else were talking from inside him . " You 're no different from the others .

" the old man asked . " He sounds crazy . Look at him . He looks crazy . Take him home . All of you , go home ! " Michael stiffened . His eyes widened , bulged . A sudden cry of rage burst from his throat . He raised the dice cup over his head . Rachel gasped loudly . The old man took a step backward into the booth . The pitchman moved in front of him .  | " You hate us ! " Michael screamed , holding the empty dice cup over his head . I lunged for his arm . He fought me for a moment , trying to twist away . " You hate us ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sound echoed painfully inside my head . I grabbed the cup from his hand . He went suddenly limp and sagged heavily against me .

He 's ? " " Go to hell , " I said , and led Michael away from the booth . Rachel followed alongside me . Her face was white . We walked quickly along the asphalt road . I had my arm around Michael 's shoulders . He moved mechanically , his face empty of expression , his eyes wide and dead-looking . " Schmeiss , " I said bitterly . " That miserable ? " I was in a trembling rage , but I broke off my words . " Michael , arc you all right ? " Rachel asked . She was walking alongside him now , looking into his face . Michael leaned heavily against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . He did not look at Rachel . His eyes were very wide . He stared straight ahead and was quiet . " I 'm frightened of the way he looks , " Rachel said . " He 'll be all right , " I said , a little frightened now myself . " We should have gone right home , " Rachel said . We came off the asphalt road onto the parking lot . I helped Michael into the car . He sat between me and Rachel , staring through the windshield . Rachel started the engine . The car moved slowly off the parking lot onto the dark highway . Driving along the highway , she accelerated swiftly . Inside my head I could still hear the shouts and rifle shots and laughter and roller coaster noise of the carnival . I kept hearing it all as we drove along and was still hearing it when we turned off the highway onto the asphalt country road . When we were a short distance from Rachel 's house I felt Michael slump down on the seat . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windshield , paying no attention to the dark trickle that moved across his lips and down onto his chin . " his nose is bleeding again , " I said . I put my hand under his elbow as he climbed out of the car . He walked limply between me and Rachel . I held my handkerchief to leis nose . Ile had not said a word since we had left the gambling booth . A yellow light burned dimly over the front door of the house . Vide-winged moths beat against the light with soft thudding sounds . The lights were on in the kitchen and the living room . Beyond the steep slope of the shoreline , the lake moved gently against the rowboat and the dock . It stretched off into the distance like a mass of black stone , darker than the darkness of the night . We came up the front walk into the house . Rachel 's parents were at the kitchen table over tall glasses of iced coffee . Joseph Gordon looked at Michael and slowly took the pipe out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nosebleed , " I told them , and before they could respond I put my hand against Michael 's back and steered him to his room . I snapped on the ceiling light and removed the pillow from the bed but did not bother to pull back the spread . I helped l ichacl onto the bed . He lay on the bed , his head drawn back , his chin jutting upward . I sat on the edge of the bed , put the forefinger of my right hand over his upper lip , and pressed down . Ile lay very still , breathing softly , his eyes closed . He seemed unaware of what was happening . The door to the room opened and closed . Joseph Gordon came up to the foot of the bed . He was a tall man in his late forties , with broad shoulders , thinning brown hair , sharp blue eyes , a square jaw , and deeply tanned features . He stared at Michael , his teeth clamped tight around his pipe . " You had quite a time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A splendid time . " " 1 ought io go over there tomorrow and break his neck . " " I lc wo n't be there tomorrow . This was the last night . "  | He took the pipe from his mouth and leaned over the foot of the bed . Michael lay very still , his eyes closed . " That vulturous bastard , " Joseph Gordon said under his breath . He looked at me . " I 'm going to call a doctor . " My finger was still on Michael 's upper lip . I felt him stir . He opened his eyes . " I do n't need a doctor , " he said very quietly . Joseph Gordon looked down at him . " I want someone to check that bleeding . " His voice was suddenly gentle . " I do n't want any doctor , " Michael said . He pushed my hand away from his lip . " Did you have to play that stupid game ? " Joseph Gordon asked . " It was n't stupid . " Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , " he said . l-le gave me an angry look and seemed about to say something . Then he glanced at Michael . He turned abruptly and went from the room . I looked down at Michael . He lay very still on the bed . I saw him put his arm across his eyes . " I really trusted him , " he said . " We all trusted him . " " I hated him . " His voice was flat , without emotion . " I could have killed him . " I felt cold listening to him talk like that . " I should never have trusted him . " His eyes were covered by his arm . His voice was rising . Below the small straight nose , his lips opened and closed stiffly , mouthing the words . " You ca n't trust any of them . They 're all the same . They're- " and a long scalding torrent of vile and hate-filled words began pouring out of him . I told him to stop it . He took his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at me . " Go away , " he said .

" Only he did n't have a beard . " I heard the door open . Sarah Gordon came into the room . She was a slender , fine-looking woman with oval features and auburn hair and gray eyes . Her voice had a quality of forced calm to it as she told Michael she had brought him a glass of milk . I ichaci said he did n't want any milk . She came over to the bed and put the glass down on the night table . " Look at your shirt , " she said . " It 's blood , " Michael said . His voice had lapsed into its flat , unemotional tone .

" " Why do n't you mind your own business ? " I looked at him and did not say anything . " Everyone is always hovering over me . " " I 'm trying to help . " " Who asked you to ? Stop hovering and go away . " " All right , " I said . I went out of the room and through the hall and into the kitchen . Rachel and her parents were sitting around the table . " How is lie ?

He was getting to his feet when Rachel came into the kitchen . Michael was n't in the house , she said . " Oh my God , " Sarah Gordon said . " I just left him in his room , " I said .

" I 'll have a look at the dock , " I said , and could feel her staring at me as I went through the kitchen to the wooden stairway outside . The sky was black and dotted with stars . There was a faint breeze . A sliver of moon hung over the lake like a curved lantern . I had forgotten to turn on the outside lights but I could see him on the dock outlined against the lake . I went quickly down the stairs and up to the end of the dock . He did not look at me . He was staring up at the sky . " Michael , " I said softly . He stared up at the sky and said nothing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said nothing . He was wearing the soiled shirt and the shorts and tennis sneakers . His hair was disheveled and his arms hung limply at his sides .

" His voice had a soft , dreamy quality to it now . " It 's like every star in the universe is out tonight . " I stood alongside him , my hand on his shoulder , thinking of Rachel and her father on the road searching for him . " Just look at it , " he said . " I did n't think to bring the viewer .

At the foot of the wooden stairway he stopped and looked at me . " I ca n't get him out of my mind , " he said faintly . I did not say anything . We were halfway up the stairway when the outside floodlights suddenly came on , throwing bright blinding light onto the stairs and the dock . Rachel and her father came from the kitchen and stood at the head of the stairs looking down at us . Michael stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , Rachel 's mother appeared at the head of the stairs . The three of them stood there , staring down at us and saying nothing . I prodded Michael gently and we went up to them . I shook my head ' at them and we passed them by and I took Michael through the kitchen into his room . He walked slowly , heavily , the laces of his sneakers trailing behind him . He lay down on the bed and closed his eyes . " You ought to go to sleep , " I told him . " Go away , " he said , putting his arm across his eyes . " Just go away . " I went from the room . Rachel and her parents were in the hallway right outside the door . " What was he doing out there ? " Joseph Gordon asked in a tight whisper . I told him . Rachel bit her lip . Her mother looked panicky . " Let 's go into the kitchen , " Joseph Gordon said . " I 've got to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want me to stay . But I was feeling dull-headed with fatigue . " Walk me to the door , " I said to Rachel . We came out of the house . The floodlights had been turned off . A moist breeze blew in from the lake . I could hear the water lapping softly against the dock and the shore . " How do you feel ? " I asked . " Fragile , " she said . Her face was faintly luminous in the darkness . " And raped . " I did not say anything . She stared across the lawn at the black expanse of the lake .  | " I think I had better get back . Is the flashlight in the car ? " " Yes . I 'll drive you if you 'd like . " " I want to walk . " Vc went to the car . She took the flashlight from the glove compartment and handed it to me . She gave me a dark , uneasy look . " Arc you bringing Danny over next week ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't know , " I said . " It depends upon Danny . " Shc bit her lip . " Do you want me to ask him ? " " Yes . " " All right . It would be nice to have him meet you finally . " She did not say anything . I leaned forward and kissed her cheek . Her face felt hot and dry . " I 'll call you in the morning , " I said . I left her standing near the car and went up the asphalt road , walking quickly past summer homes and sloping lawns . To my left was the lake , dark and silent beyond the houses and the lawns . From the dense woods along the right side of the road came the soft pulsating sounds of crickets and frogs . The sky was filled with stars . But the road was dark and I could see almost nothing beyond the beam of the flashlight . Then the road curved to the right and the houses and lawns were gone and there were woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the left side of the road , letting the light play on the brush and the trees . The path through the woods was narrow , a barely visible break in the dense brush . I came off the road and entered the woods . The path twisted narrowly , thick with dead leaves and fallen branches and the tangled roots of elms and oaks and sycamores , then straightened and ran through a small clearing of tall grass . Beyond the clearing it curved between giant trees and led downward and curved again , and the air was dense now with the odor of the lake and the smell of damp dead leaves and wet black earth . I stood near the edge of the lake . The water was black and motionless , wedged stonelike against the shore . In the beam of the  | flashlight a long-legged spider skated soundlessly across the surface of the water . I followed the curve of the shore . A small white animal crouched on the path , frozen by the light . I moved the light away and heard it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stars , a pale unsteady finger of light burrowing through the darkness , and it was a moment before I realized my hands were trembling . I turned off the light and stood very still . In the abrupt , total darkness of the night the odor of moist decay was suddenly overpowering . I snapped the light back on and continued walking . ' The shoreline straightened , curved sharply , and straightened again , forming a tiny inlet . The smooth surface of the lake reflected the stars , stone speckled with tiny quirvering pinpoints of light . I stepped over dead trees and thick branches . Then the path angled sharply away from the lake and I was in the woods again , walking very quickly between thick-trunked trees , and there was the maple and the back lawn and the cottage , dark except for the single yellow light that burned over the door of the screened-in porch . My father was asleep . I lay awake in my bed and listened to the trees outside the open window . I lay awake a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asphalt-paved street that was Bedford Avenue and listening to a short , intense , thick-shouldered , black-bearded man explain a passage of Talmud . I lay very still in the darkness .  | ' I he wind woke me . It blew through the open window and stirred the curtains . I could feel it cool and moist on my face . I lay in the bed and remembered the night . When I came out to the screened-in porch I saw my father already there , praying the Morning Service , the fringes of his long tallith reaching nearly to the floor , the straps of his tefillin wound carefully around his arm and head . The porch faced eastward and the sun shone above the trees of the woods and came through the screening , and my father stood facing the sun , praying from memory , his eyes closed behind their steel-rimmed spectacles , the sun bright on his thin features and gray hair . I put on my tefillin and prayed quietly and afterward I prepared a light breakfast and we sat in the kitchen and ate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods swayed heavily in the wind . But it was a warm wind now and would not keep me from the lake . I told my father about last night . " He scares me a little , " I said when I was done , ! Tye I'ye never . eenanyone so angry . " " lie had reason to be angry . You are certain that old man deliberately cheated you ? " " ' That old man was the vilest person I 've ever met . " Later , I went into the living room and dialed the phone . I heard it ring for quite some time before it was answered . " I kilo , " I said . " Reuven ? " Rachel said . " Where 's Michael ? " " lle 's around somewhere . " " I low are you feeling ? " " Very , very fragile . " I asked her if she was working on her paper . She was spending  | her mornings that summer writing a long paper on the Ithaca section of James Joyce 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was working on the paper , she said . " Would Michael want to go sailing ? " She hesitated . I could feel her hesitating . " Ask your father if it 's okay . " The phone went silent . She had evidently cupped her hand over it . I waited for what seemed to me to be a long time . " My father thinks it 's all right , " she said finally . " Give a yell for Michael . " She cupped her hand over the phone again . " Yes ? " Michael said after another long pause . His voice sounded thin and distant . " Hello , " I said . " How are you ? " " All right . " " Would you like to go sailing ? " " Now ? " " Yes . " " I do n't know . It 's very windy . " " It 's the best time for it . " There was a brief silence . " All right , " he said . " But I do n't know too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Find yourself a piece of string and tie it to the earpieces of your glasses and put it tight around your head so the glasses wo n't fall off . And wear a bathing suit and some kind of shirt . Okay ? " " Yes , " he said , very hesitantly . " I 'll see you soon . " I changed into swim trunks , a T shirt , and thongs , went into the kitchen , found some string , and tied my glasses tightly to my head . Through the screen door of the kitchen I saw my father seated at the wooden table on the back porch , working on his book . I told him I was going over to RachelSand would be back in time for lunch . He nodded vaguely , without looking up . I went out to the street and walked quickly beneath the trees to the beach . Some early bathers were lounging about on the sand and splash- ing in the water . The wind blew stiffly across the lake . I walked across the beach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in his early sixties and his seventeen-year-old son . ' I'lhc ivaii was not there . The boy was sitting on the edge of the dock , his legs dangling in the water , his eyes closed . He turned when he heard me coming up the dock and gave me a sleepy look . " Rough night ? " I said , to make conversation . " Yeah , " he said , and grinned . I wondered for a moment if I ought to take a sailboat instead of a Sailfish , then decided against it . A Sailfish was less complicated , despite the possibility of its turning over , and I did not think I wanted to trust Michael with the jib sheet of a sailboat . Serving as ballast for a Sailfish would be enough for him . I asked for a Sailfish . Ile stared sleepily at the boats tied to the dock and bobbing in the waves . " Take any one you want . " He yawned noisily . I took off my thongs and handed them to him , then pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and put up the mainsail . The Sailfish was painted red and the mainsail was white with narrow red stripes . I let the sheet hang loose and the sail flapped noisily in the wind . " Where 's the center board ? " I asked . He looked at the boat , grinned sheepishly , then went with the thongs to the shed on the beach near the dock and came back with the board . I balanced myself carefully on the Sailfish and inserted the board . It went in with difficulty . " Is this the right board ? " " They 're all the same . How long you going to be gone ? " " About two hours . " " You got a great wind , " he said with obvious uninterest , and yawned again . " Untie me , " I said . Ile loosened the rope from the metal ring on the dock and dropped it into the water . I worked the mainsail sheet with my right hand and the tiller with my left . The sail caught the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billowed out and went taut .  | The Sailfish moved swiftly away from the dock . I tacked toward the middle of the lake , bouncing on the waves and sliding into troughs . The wind blew steadily and the waves were big and dark and crested with foam . There were clouds in the sky now but they were nowhere near the sun . I felt the Sailfish begin to slide and I put the sheet between my teeth and pushed the center board all the way clown . The Sailfish lurched to starboard in a gust of wind , the port side lifting up out of the water . I transferred the sheet to my hand and leaned out backward over the edge , feeling the exhilaration of fighting the wind and riding the waves . The Sailfish raced across the water , leaving behind a white foamy wake , and for a long time I forgot about the old man and the carnival and Michael waiting for me in the house on the other side of the lake , and felt only the wind and the sun and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hand against the gusting air . The dock was deserted . I pulled up alongside it and tied the Sailfish to a support beam and climbed up the ladder . The planks were hot beneath my bare feet . I shouted Michael 's name . A moment later , the door at the head of the wooden stairway opened and Michael came outside . Behind him came Sarah and Joseph Gordon , and Rachel . They followed him down the stairway . Michael wore a dark swimsuit and a T shirt . He had tied his glasses to his head with a piece of string . He looked a little nervous . They came up to the edge of the dock and stared down at the bobbing Sailfish . The water surged against the support beams of the dock and rolled onto the shore . On the other side of the dock , the rowboat bounced on the waves . Michael was looking at the Sailfish . " I 've never been out in one of those , " he said . " They 're a lot of fun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sailfish , " Joseph Gordon said . " It goes like a motorboat . " I was trying to sound cheerful . " I thought you would bring a boat , " Sarah Gordon said . She wore a light-green summer dress that blew out behind her in the wind . " The Sailfish is simpler . "  | " Please be careful , " Rachel said . She had on her reading glasses and was holding her hands against the sides of her head to keep her hair from blowing about . ' I ' 1Icy stood there , hovering protectively around Michael . I climbed clown onto the Sailfish and , balancing myself carefully , helped Michael aboard and sat him down alongside the center board . I untied the rope and pushed us off and scrambled for the sheet . I hauled in on the sheet and the sail billowed out with a sudden puffing sound , and the Sailfish responded to the rudder and slid swiftly away from the dock . I looked over my shoulder . Rachel and her parents stood stiffly on the dock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean voyage . I looked at Michael . He sat near the center board , gripping the rail behind him with both hands , tense , tight , wide-eyed . The Sailfish lurched to port in a sudden gust of wind and Michael gasped as the starboard side tilted up out of the water . " Lean back , " I told him . " All the way back . That 's right . " The Sailfish straightened , responding immediately to Michael 's weight . " Good . Very good . Now come in slowly toward the center . " Iie wriggled forward a little , his hands pushing on the flat surface of the boat . " That 's right , " I said , and gave him an encouraging smile . " You 'll balance the boat with your weight . Okay ? " He nodded hesitantly . " You move back and forth to keep us straight in the water . But move slowly . " ' We lurched again to port . " Now ! " I said . " That 's right . Move back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as you can . " The boat straightened and Michael slid forward again toward the center . " Very good . You 're doing fine . Just fine . " he gave me a brief , tentative smile . We sailed toward the middle of the lake . There were many clouds now in the sky but they were off in the west and not blocking the sun . Far off in the distance there was a sheen of gold across the water and beyond it was the blue line of the horizon . We sailed swiftly in the wind , and the waves were dark and choppy and the troughs were deep and we dropped into them and came steeply up , crashing into the waves and sliding somewhat despite the center board . The mainsail sheet was around my hand  | and I felt it biting into the flesh but I held it tight and the sail held the wind and we moved like a motorboat across the water . We sailed for a very long time and I watched Michael moving his body back and forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one point he leaned way out across the rail in response to a wild gust of wind , half his body over the side , arching tightly , grasping the rail and leaning out backward , and suddenly he laughed and it was the same laugh I had heard from him on the roller coaster the night before . Then he looked at me and there was spray on his face and a brightness in his eyes . There were many boats on the lake now and veering away from one of them we took a strong gust of wind and the boom went down toward the water and Michael leaned way out over the rail , throwing his head and shoulders back . We tilted sharply to port and the boom skimmed the water and I braced myself and felt spray on my face and hands , and the boom went under , and then the sail , and we came to a dead stop . Michael was sitting on the upended edge of the Sailfish and I saw him let go of the rail and slide slowly into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The water was warm . I did not go under . Michael reappeared alongside me , still wearing his glasses . He shook water from his face . His dark-brown hair looked pasted to his head . I heard him laugh and watched him tread water . " Too much wind , " I told himz and grinned . " I was n't scared , " he said . " I went in and was n't scared at all . " " You were okay . " " What do we do ? " " I 'll show you . " He helped me right the Sailfish . Then we were back on it and I was tacking toward the house and the dock . Michael lay near the center board , his eyes closed now , his wet face to the sun . He was smiling to himself . His lips smiled and then went straight and then they smiled again and then went straight again . He kept smiling on and off as he shifted his weight on the Sailfish . He lay like that a long time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked around . " Are we going hack ? "  | " No . " " ' There 's the dock . Why are we going toward the dock ? " " " I'here 's a cove beyond the house . " I lc looked at me . " ' Thcre wo n't be the wind there . We can tie up the boat . It 'll be shallow but the water will be smooth . " I le looked at me and his eyes narrowed with suspicion . " We can lie around and relax and swim . It 's a very nice cove . " I lc lay back on the Sailfish and closed his eyes . " We can do some more sailing later on if you want . " Ile did not say anything . We sailed toward the cove . " I 'll need you to raise the center hoard soon . " He opened his eyes . We were coming in very fast . He sat up and put his hands on top of the board . We were about fifty yards from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We sailed past the house . The dock was deserted . There were huge boulders along the shore , and tall trees and dense brush . I could see the trees swaying in the wind . A few hundred yards beyond the house was the cove , a shallow inlet protected from the wind by steep banks and towering trees . I tacked toward the cove and we moved along a zigzag course , and then the water was suddenly shallow and I saw the lake bed , and I said , " Okay . Raise it halfway . " Michael pulled up on the center board . It did not move . " Pull up hard , " I said . He was on his knees alongside it , pulling , and it would not move and I felt it scrape against the bottom of the lake and the Sailfish bucked . " Pull ! " I yelled . He pulled with all his strength , the muscles of his thin arms bulging . I felt the center board scrape again along the lake bed . I put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my right hand on the center board . Michael looked at me . His hair lay across his forehead . His face was tight . He pried my hand from the board . I felt his thin fingers prying my hand from the board . IIc pulled furiously on the board . The wind gusted against  | the sail and the sheet tugged hard on my teeth . I transferred the sheet to my hand and held the sail taut . The center board moved up slowly . " Halfway , " I said . " Okay . Now leave it . We 'll need it up all the way in a minute . Wait . All right . Pull it up . Can you manage it ? " The center board came up without difficulty . Michael sat back on the Sailfish . His face was pale . I collapsed the sail . The prow scraped against the bank , I tied up to the branch of a fallen tree that lay in the water . Michael sat stiffly near the center board . " It was stuck , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I had trouble with that board myself before . " " Why was it stuck ? " " The water warps them sometimes . " " I got it up by myself though . " " You did all right . " A smile flickered across his face . He lay back on the Sailfish and closed his eyes . We were in about two feet of water . The cove was narrow , with tall banks of dark moist earth that broke the force of the wind and huge trees and water lilies that grew along the shoreline . The sun shone through the water to the bottom of the lake and I could see schools of small fish and the dark mud of the lake bed . Tiny waves lapped with soft sounds against the Sailfish and the shore . We lay on the Sailfish and rested . Then we swam for a while , stirring up the muddy bottom of the cove with our feet . Michael did the crawl and back stroke and side stroke and tried very hard to show me he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes had a dreamy , distant look to them . We swam around and had a fine time and when we came back to the Sailfish . I. smiled at him and he smiled hack tentatively and I said he was all right as a swimmer but he needed to put on some weight , he was too skinny . He put his glasses back on and lay on the Sailfish with his face to the sun . " I 'm chronically underweight . My mother keeps taking me to doctors and they all say I 'm chronically underweight . " " You 'll outgrow it . I used to be a little underweight . "  | " That 's what the doctors say about my nosebleeds . I have nosebleeds when I exert myself too much or get too excited . Did you used to have nosebleeds ? " " No. " have them all the time . " " Like last night . " He opened his eyes and looked at me . He did not say anything . I lc looked away and placed the palms of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His arms formed sharp angles on each side of his head , the elbows jutting upward . " Your nose is n't bleeding today . You did plenty of hard work out there on the lake and your nose did n't bleed at all . " " That 's right , " he said . " How do you explain that ? " " I do n't know . It does n't bleed every time . " " I 'm glad it did n't bleed out there . " He turned his head and looked at me . " Let 's not talk about that any more . Okay ? Let 's just not talk about that . " " All right . " " I do n't like to talk about it . " " All right , Michael . " I lay back on the Sailfish . We were silent . I could hear the wind in the trees . The boat lay still in the water . " , s vernice out here , " I heard Michael say quietly . pi glad you like it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little afraid at the beginning . I had to get used to it . " He was silent for a long time . I saw him staring intently at the sky . Then he said , very quietly , " Can you read clouds ? " " How do you mean ? " It 's a game I play sometime " He gave me a sidelong glance , the , looked back up at.ie sky . It shows you how you see things .. How do you play it ? : You look at the clouds and you say what their shapes remind you of . Sec that big cloud over there ? What does it look like ? '  | He was pointing to a large fleecy cloud that lay above the high line of trees along the northern side of the shoreline . I told him it looked like a large fleecy cloud . He looked disappointed . " Do n't you want to play ? It 's really a serious game , Reuven . " " I 'm sorry . " Sometimes I feel better after I play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look . You have to tell yourself the truth " All right . Let me try again . " looked at the cloud . " It looks like a camel with a lot of humps on its back . " He was quiet for a moment , his face tjrned to the sky . " It looks ike a roller coaster , " he said , very quiet 1 looked up at the cloud and did n't say anything " The one near it , the one that 's a little above it and to the right , that one looks like the face of an old man . " He paused . " Does it look like that to you , Reuven ? " " A little , " I said , still keeping my face turned to the sky . We lay on the Sailfish and were quiet . A flock of birds soared high overhead , heading west away from the sun . The Sailfish floated smoothly in the calm water of the cove . Michael broke the silence . " Look at how the roller coaster is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft . " It 's becoming round . You see that ? It looks round now . Does that remir d you of anything ? " " Yes , " I said . " What does it remind you of ? " " A ball . " He looked at me slowly . " A giant of a ball . Like the balls we played with last night multiplied thousands of times . " He looked at me and nodded and was silent . I scanned the sky . The cloud Michael had said resembled the old man was changing now , moving slowly along its edges , parts of it drifting off , other parts flowing and re-forming.  | " ' Ile old man is smiling , " I said . " Can you see him smiling ? " " Yes , " Michael said as if from very far away . " But he has a mean look . I do n't like him . " " Neither do I. " " I lc reminds me of the old man at the carnival . " Michael did not speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring up at the cloud . Then he said , in a low voice , " I like Rachel . I like her a lot . " I did not say anything . " Are you and Rachel in love ? " " I do n't know . " " Are you going to ask her to marry you ? " " It is n't anywhere near that yet . " " Do you and your father come here every summer ? " " Yes . In August . " " It 's strange you did n't meet her before . She 's been coming here every summer since the end of the war . " I did not respond . He was quiet again . Then , he said , looking up at the cloud , " It reminds me of the old man too . The cloud , I mean . It reminds me of the old man at the carnival and of others like him . " " Which others ? " He was silent . " Which others , Michael ? " " You wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Why should I be angry ? Which others ? " " Some of . the rabbis in your school . " He glanced at me , then looked quickly away . " Which rabbis ? " " Rav Kalman . " " Why does it remind you of Rav Kalman ? " " Because he 's vicious and deceitful like that old man . " " Why do you say that ? " " Because he is. " " 1 do n't think he 's vicious and deceitful . " " Do you know Rav Kalman ? "  | " I 'm in his Talmud class . " He looked startled . " I did n't know that , " he mum-lured . He sounded afraid and very apologetic . He was quiet for a moment . Is he a good scholar ? " " He 's a great scholar . Why-do you say he 's vicious and deceit-ful ? " " You wo n't be angry at me ? He 's your teacher and I do n't want to talk about him if it will make you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little angry at you , Michael . Butthat does n't mean I. wo n't like you . " He looked at me and a peculiar questioning frown came across his face , as if he were trying to understand what I had just said . After a long moment , I heard him say , " Rav Kalman is very religious . Is n't he fanatically religious ? " " He 's very religious . Yes . " " Then why does he go around using slander against people who disagree with him ? " He used the Talmudic term " lashon hara " . for slander . " Where did you ever hear Rav Kalman use slander ? " " He uses it all the time . " " You 're talking about the way he attacks your father and his school . Is that what you 're talking about ? " His face darkened and turned sullen . " You know what the Talmud says is the punishment for lashon hara ? Leprosy . There 's a rabbi in the Talmud who even says there 's no atonement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious and use lashon hara ? " " How do you know so much about Rav Kalman ? " " I know . I read what he writes in those Orthodox magazines and newspapers . " He writes about your father and his school ?

You swim and you sail and you 're tanned and you do n't read your own Orthodox newspa- pers . I 've never met a yeshiva student like you . " " I low many have you met ? " " I meet them all the time .

They think they 're God over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bug if you do n't agree with them . They 're going to poison all of us with their crazy ideas . " ' They 're fighting for what they believe in. "  | " ' I'hey 're vicious . I really hate them . They 're disgusting . " " All right , Michael . " Again , he was quiet a very long time . He lay with his eyes closed and I thought he had fallen asleep and then I saw him open his eyes and look up at the sky . " It 's beautiful out here . Look at the trees and the sky . It 's really beautiful . I do n't mind it so much talking out here . " " Sailing and talking . What could be better ? " " I wish it were night . Then I could see the stars . " " We could n't sail if it were night . " " I wish it were night and we could sail anyway and I could see the stars . " " You could give me a lesson in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I know how to find the Big Dipper . " " That is n't very much . " " That is n't anything at all . " " I wish it were night . It 's easier to talk at night with the stars . " " You have n't done so badly talking now . " " No , " he murmured . " It 's easy to talk to you . " " And I 'm a yeshiva boy . " " Yes " I 'm of the nonvicious variety . " He smiled . " Would you like to swim ? " " Yes . " " Then we 'll get in some more sailing . " " I 'd like that . " " Okay , " I said . " I 'll race you to that rock . " We raced and I won and we swam a while in the cove and then sailed back out toward the middle of the lake and Michael lay on the Sailfish , moving hack and forth with the thrusting of the wind . His eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he kept his hands tight around the rail of the craft  --  and he talked . " Can you feel the sun , Rcuven ? Can you feel how hot it is ? Did you know Giordano Bruno was burned alive in Rome in i600 for writing that  | the stars were suns ? Did you know the gases in the interior of the sun arc more than ten million degrees Kelvin ? That 's hot . They burned him alive because he wrote that the stars were suns . I wonder what it 's like to be burned alive . Fire on your feet and around your legs and the pain as the fire creeps up . When do you die when you 're burned alive ? I think about that sometimes . They cheated Bruno . They killed him for the truth . But he did n't cheat . I is wrote the truth . You have to get killed sometimes but you ca n't cheat . The cheating never hurts the stars but your eyes get clouded . I really believe that . Your eyes get clouded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of telescope . There are different kinds of telescopes . Did you know that ? There are refracting telescopes and reflecting telescopes and there 's the Schmidt telescope . I read about them in a book . Refracting telescopes are okay but you have to watch out for chromatic aberration . Reflecting telescopes do n't have that problem . But they have other problems , lots of other different problems . God , listen to me talking . I ca n't stop talking . Vhy ca n't I stop talking ? What was I saying ? Problems . The Schmidt telescope has problems too . Everything has problems . There 's nothing anywhere without problems . There 's no one without problems . Look at the clouds . They 're beautiful . God , they 're beautiful . There 's one that looks like someone burning . Yes . Someone is burning . Who does n't have problems ? " We sailed and he talked and then we were near the shoreline and he talked and I could make out clearly the trees and the boulders and summer homes and people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods and still he talked . Then , quite suddenly , he was silent . We sailed in that silence the rest of the way to the dock . I collapsed the sail and tied up to the dock . I climbed the ladder . and put out my hand to help Michael but he went up by himself , moving carefully from the Sailfish to the ladder and then up the rungs , and lie stood next to me on the dock looking out across the lake , his hair blowing in the wind , his eyes blue and dreamy and moist behind his large glasses . He did not look at me . He looked cult at the lake and his voice was soft .  | " I wanted the radio for my parents . I wanted to give it to them as a corning-home present . " " You 'll find something else to give them . " " Our old radio keeps breaking down . My parents like to listen to radio broadcasts from Europe . Especially my mother . She understands and speaks a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hebrew . Then there are other languages she can only read but ca n't speak . " " That 's a lot of languages , all right . " " Reuven . " He was looking at me now . " Yes . " " Did we lose much money last night ? " " Yes . " " My father will pay you back what you loaned me . " I did not say anything . " I wish we had never gone . " " Well , we went . " " I would n't have minded it so much if we had gambled and just lost . " " It does n't do much good to keep talking about it , Michael . " " We gambled and were cheated . You have to fight when you 're cheated . But I ca n't fight . " " Come on . I 'll walk you to the house . " " You do n't have to come in with me . We 've been out a long time . The boat will cost you a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said hello . " " I wish it had been night . I could have shown you the constellations . " " Another time .

" " I gambled I would enjoy sailing with you . I did n't really know you at all until today . I gambled. " 57 The Promise " laid you win ? " " Yes , " he said . Then he turned and I watched him go slowly along the clock and up the stairway and into the house . I climbed back down onto the Sailfish . The wind moved me away from the shoreline . I sailed alone on the Sailfish . There were clouds iii the sky . The sun felt hot . I sailed alone and looked back at the dock and saw it off in the distance , a deserted sliver of white-painted wood thrust into the heaving darkness of the lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot . I sailed alone on the Sailfish and moved back and forth to keep the boat level in the water . The wind took me swiftly across the lake .  | I called Rachel the next morning . She was in a bad mood . I1cr passion for James Joyce was undergoing a severe test as she made her way through Ithaca . Michael was in a splendid mood , she said . lie had gone swimming earlier and was now buried in an astronomy book . Yes , he had loved the sailing . His parents had cabled from Jerusalem . They were flying in from Israel on Thursday and would be up for the weekend . She had to get back to her Ithaca catechism . She was working on an idea in connection with Bloom 's thoughts about Stephen 's thoughts about Bloom and Bloom 's thoughts about Stephen 's thoughts about Bloom 's thoughts about Stephen . It was a splendid idea , she said . I wished her luck . It rained all of Wednesday . I spent most of Tuesday and Wednesday alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Logic and used my evenings to go over the sections on polyadic problems and Lowenbeim 's Theorem . My father continued working on his book . On Thursday morning the galley proofs arrived for the revised part of the manuscript , which he had sent to his publisher some weeks ago . His hands trembled as he opened the package . He looked at the galleys and his eyes shone and he seemed to be looking at a newborn child . That afternoon I took a sailboat out on the lake . There was a strong wind and I sailed toward the dock of Rachel 's house . I wanted to surprise Michael and take him sailing again . The dock was deserted . The house seemed empty . There were tall white clouds in the sky . I tied up to the dock and climbed the stairway and knocked on the door to the kitchen . No one answered . The door was locked . I realized they had probably all gone to the airport . I took the sailboat back across the lake .  | Later that evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I hung up . I came out to the back porch . My father had completed his revisions of the last part of the manuscript that afternoon and had sent it off to his publisher . Now he was checking the galleys . The wind moved loudly through the branches of the maple near the edge of the back lawn . I sat for a while and watched him . Then I went inside to my room . I talked to Rachel early the next morning . Thev had gone into New York to meet Michael 's parents at the airport . The plane had been an hour late . Yes , Michael 's parents were at the house now . They were resting . No , it was n't a good idea for me to come over on Shabbat . The family wanted to be alone . They had a lot to talk about . Her voice sounded subdued . How were Bloom 's thoughts about Stephen 's thoughts about Bloom ? I wanted to know . Bloom was alone in the cold of interstellar space , she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She was about to hang up . Then she asked me to wait a moment . The phone went silent . Then I heard a loud , deep voice . I had been holding the phone . close to my car . The voice made my car tingle . " Reuven Malter , " the voice said . " Yes . " " This is Abraham Gordon . " A lot more than just my ear began to tingle . I gripped the phone tightly . " Yes , sir , " I said . " Is your father in ? " " Yes . " " Let me talk to him . " I called my father in from the porch . Ile took the phone . Thev talked brieflv . " Sunday morning at ten , " my father said . " Yes . It will be good to sec you again , Abraham . You were shown the Dead Sca Scrolls ? Ve must talk about that . IIow is Kaufmann ? I am glad to hear it . Yes . Sunday . Fine . Shabbat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the room . " Reuvcn , " I heard Abraham Gordon say .  | " Yes , sir . " " Verbal fraud is worse than monetary fraud . ' " The words cause out in a rapid Sephardic Hebrew . " Is that statement familiar to you ? " " Shimon ben Yochai in Baba Metzia , " I said , giving the Talmudic source of the quote he had used . " You are David Malter 's son , no doubt of that . You experienced both kinds of fraud last Sunday night , I understand . We 'll discuss it on Sunday . Michael enjoyed sailing with you . Shabbat shalom . What ? " He spoke away from the phone . " Yes . " He came back on the phone . " Michael says to tell you Shabbat shalom for him . " His voice echoed inside my head for quite a while after I hung up the phone . The next morning my father and I prayed at the small synagogue a few blocks from the cottage , then returned to the cottage for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while after the meal , and then my father went into his bedroom to rest . I took a blanket out to the back lawn and lay in the sun reading an Agnon novel in Hebrew . Clouds drifted overhead , huge balls of white cotton moving against the brilliant blue of the sky . A cardinal disappeared into the maple and for a while it seemed the leaves were singing . I fell asleep on the blanket in the sun . I thought I heard a deep voice call my name . I opened my eves . The grass shivered faintly in the warm breeze . I was alone on the lawn . Rachel called that night a few minutes after the end of Shabbat . They had had a good Shabbat , she said , sounding very subdued . They had talked last night until two in the morning and all of today . Was Danny still clue up tomorrow ? Yes , I said . IIe had n't called to sav he was n't coming and I had n't called to withdraw the invitation . Ilow had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He rested , " she said . The call from Danny woke me at seven thirty the next morning . His slightly nasal voice was thin and metallic over the phone . He had just been called by the treatment center . There was an emergency with one of the boys . He had to run . He would not be over today . He could come up tomorrow . They were giving him the day  | off tomorrow . Was it all right for him to come up tomorrow ? I told him tomorrow would be fine . He was doing his pre-doctoral fieldwork in psychology at a residential treatment center in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn and that was his third emergency that summer . I waited until nine o'clock and called Rachel . She listened and put her hand over the phone . Then she took her hand away . " My uncle will be over in an hour . he 'll talk to you . " I sat on the back porch reading the Sunday New York Times and waiting for Abraham Gordon . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doings of Senator Joseph McCarthy . Outside two squirrels played on the lawn for a while , then scampered up the trunk of the maple and disappeared into the leaves . It was warm and the sky was blue and cloudless . A bird sang somewhere nearby . My father sat at the wooden table reading his galleys . I put down the newspaper and sat very still and looked at the sunlight on the leaves of the maple and listened to the bird . It sang a very long time . Then it was silent . I thought I could still hear it singing . Back in January , I had found a copy of Abraham Gordon 's first book on a shelf in the Brooklyn Public Library and had taken it home to read . The book was worn and had obviously been read by many people before me . One of those people had scribbled in I Icbrew across the half-title page : " This is the book of an apostate . Those who fear God are forbidden to read it . " When I was done reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I checked the catalogue for the most recent book by Abraham Gordon and found that one of the books listed in the catalogue had been published a year ago . I assumed that was his most recent book . I searched for it but it was out . All his other books were out too . I came back to the library a few days later and found the book . It contained a list of all his previously published titles . I  | checked the catalogue again and discovered that the library had all leis books . I began to reserve the books in the order in which they had been published . I would reserve a book and after a week or so I would he informed that it was in and I would take it out and reserve the next book . All through the rest of the winter and into the early spring I read the books of Abraham Gordon . I read them only at home . I would not dare bring them to school . Occasionally I would discuss the-books with my father , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study library , which was comprised almost entirely of works that had to do with the Talmud . " There is more to religion than sociology and anthropology , " he said to me once as we sat around the kitchen table talking about Abraham Gordon 's second book . " You are attracted to Abraham Gordon 's ideas , Reuven ? They are very radical ideas . " " I 'm only curious . " " Yes , I can see you arc . " " He asks very good questions . I do n't like his answers . But he asks some very important questions . " Ile smiled . " I will tell him when I see him that my son likes his questions . " The book we were discussing was on the table . I turned to the half-title page . It contained the same scrawled Hebrew warning I had found in the previous book : " This is the book of an apostate . Those who fear God are forbidden to read it . " I showed it to my father . He became angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' not those who fear God . ' There are times when those who fear God make themselves very unpleasant as human beings . " Abraham Gordon had published five books . Each of those books had the same words written on the half-title page : " ' This is the book of an apostate . Those who fear God are forbidden to read it . " I grew to loathe the writer of those words . It was a long and lonely winter . My father was writing . Danny was off at Columbia , working for his doctorate in clinical psychol- ogy . In September three new rabbis had come onto the Talmud faculty at Hirsch . They had been in concentration camps . They were great Talmudists . They valued nothing but Talmud and knew nothing but Talmud . The greatest scholar of the three was Rav Jacob Kalman . He was given the class in the Talmud tractate Chullin . The knowledge of that tractate was a prerequisite for ordination . I was put into his class . I spent the winter studying Chullin and reading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished the last of his published books . I found myself intrigued by those books . They were written in a clear and on occasion almost exquisite prose style , the kind of style one rarely finds in works of philosophy and theology . And they were filled with blunt questions : Do you believe the world was created in six days ? Do you believe in the order of creation given in the Bible ? Do you believe Eve was created from Adam 's rib ? Do you believe in angels ? Do you believe in the biblical account of the Revelation at Sinai ? Do you believe in miracles ? Do you believe that God guides the destiny of every living creature ? Do you believe that God talked , actually talked , in the manner described in the Bible ? How is one to react to the findings of archeology and anthropology and biology and astronomy and physics ? How is one to react to the discoveries of modern biblical scholarship ? How might one not believe literally in the Bible and still remain a traditional Jew ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or is it possible to reinterpret ancient beliefs in a way that will make them relevant to the modern world and at the same time not cause one to abandon the tradition ? The problems he raised fascinated me . But Abraham Gordon was a humanist , a naturalist . For him supernaturalism and mysticism were irrelevant to modern thought . Revelation was a fiction , believed in by the ancients but no longer believable today . Religion was the creation of man ; its purpose was to make meaningful certain aspects of human existence . Religious rituals heightened the routinized activities of man . God was a lofty human idea , a goal , a man-created aspiration , an abstract guarantor of the intrinsic meaningfulness of the universe . None of this was I  | able to accept  --  yet , I remained intrigued by Abraham Gordon . The dust jackets of his books had no biographical information on him beyond the brief statement that he was professor of Jewish philosophy at the Zechariah Frankel Seminary . Nor had there been any photographs . But I found him listed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago ; raised there ; B.A. , University of Chicago ; doctorate , in philosophy , from Harvard ; the next two years in Europe ; the following four years studying for the rabbinate at the Zechariah Frankel Seminary , - whose faculty he joined , at the age of thirty-two , immediately on being ordained . He published his first book at thirty-four . He belonged to some half-dozen national and international scholarly organizations . His wife 's name was Ruth , and he had one child , a son , Michael . That was all I learned about Abraham Gordon from Who 's Who . The biographical data gave no indication as to how his hooks had been received over the years by the very Orthodox . There was no allusion to the loathing and hatred with which certain people pronounced Abraham Gordon 's name . But I did not need Who 's Who to tell me about that . On a night in the first week of May I took a subway to Danny 's apartment near Columbia and we talked about Abraham Gordon . I had seen Danny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbia he had removed the visible indicators of his Hasidic origin  --  the sand-colored beard , the flowing carlocks , the dark suit , the caftan , the open-necked tieless shirt , the dark hat he wore on weekdays and the fur-trimmed cap he wore on Shabbat and festivals . He had glowed with his new freedom . And the glow had not dimmed even after he had settled down to the grinding routine of graduate work . He was doing very well in his studies , and his phenomenal memory was the subject of much conversation in the psychology department at Columbia . IIe was finding it somewhat difficult to make friends . The nonobservant Jewish students in the department were embarrassed by his skullcapped presence ; the two other Orthodox Jewish students in the department were easier for him to talk to but , not interesting enough for him to want their friendship ; and the non-Jewish students treated  | him as sonic kind of holy man , an Alyosha Karamazov thrown suddenly into their midst , a Jew with the mind of an Einstein and the soul of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticky experiment , someone to use as a resource person when they needed a reference , but not someone to invite over to an apartment for a beer and idle talk , or to sit with in a corner cafeteria , or to talk to about the girls they went with , or to involve in a conversation about Senator Joseph McCarthy or Korea or the cold war . But Danny did not really care about his nonexistent social life . As a matter of fact , he would not have gone anywhere to eat even if he had been asked , for he was holding rigidly to the laws of kashruth and he ate only those foods he prepared by himself in his apartment . And he was not interested in idle talk , had never been interested in conversation that served merely to help time pass , was awkward and inept at it , and was not concerned at all about Senator McCarthy 's anti-Communist crusade or the Korean War or the diplomatic maneuverings of Russia and the United States . Ile was interested only in his studies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dingy one-room affair on the top floor of an old three-story red-brick house on a side street off Riverside Drive . The floor was covered with a cracked and lumpy piece of linoleum . There was a sofa bed against a peeling wall and a tiny kitchen-stove  --  sink  --  refrigerator arrangement in a part of the room that had once been a walk-in closet . Danny had never been particularly neat in his personal habits and the room he now lived in reflected that lack of neatness . It was a wild disarray of books , papers , unwashed dishes , and dirty clothes . Books were strewn everywhere , on the unmade sofa bed , on the small table where he ate , on the floor near the bed , on the worn and scarred wooden desk near the single window that looked out onto a fire escape and an alleyway . The small bookcase that stood against the wall opposite the desk was jammed with hooks and monographs ; they spilled out of the bookcase onto the floor , and precarious Pisas of books were piled high against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dim light illumined the room from the  | overhead fixture and cast bleak and gloomy shadows everywhere . I had told him on a previous visit that it was a miserable apartment . IIe had told me he could n't afford anything else ; he was spending most of his money on books . All he needed was a place to eat , sleep , and study . What else did he need ? Now he was silting on the old wooden chair near the desk and I was on the unmade sofa bed against the peeling wall . Stale air pervaded the room like a foul mist . The window was closed . The shade was up . The dark night pressed against the window , adding to the dinginess of the room . I got up and opened the window and pulled down the shade . It billowed faintly in the breeze , scraping against the sill . I went back to the bed and sat down and looked at him . I lc was pale and gaunt , and the lines of his sculptured face jutted sharply and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lark with fatigue behind his black horn-rimmed glasses . I became a little angry that night at the way he was living . I told him the least he could do was keep the place clean . I told him I had thought that one of the things he had wanted to do with his new freedom was abandon his old Eastern European small-town living habits . Open the window , I said . Let in some air . Wash the dishes . Make the bed . Arrange the books neatly . Get the laundry clone . What kind of freedom was this ? And what about his life outside the apartment ? He was free . But what was he doing with his freedom ? Did he go to the opera ? Did he see a ballet ? Did he take in any of the good movies ? He shrugged . He was too busy with his schoolwork , he said . He went to the movies occasionally . He had seen Symphonie Pastorale a few months ago . It was a beautiful movie . He had seen Aida at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't care for ballet . But there was too much schoolwork . He did n't have time . " You need a girl , " I told him . " Why do n't you find yourself a girl and go out and enjoy yourself ? " He fidgeted uncomfortably on the chair . There seemed little I could do to get him to remake his life . He was obsessed by his hunger to attain perfection in the profession  | for which he had broken with the tzaddikate . So I stopped badgering him about his personal habits and we talked for a while about my father 's book and about my own year at Hirsch , and we got onto the subject of the books I was reading that had nothing to do with my schoolwork and I asked him if he had ever heard of Abraham Gordon . Sure he had heard of Abraham Gordon , he said . Who had n't heard of Abraham Gordon ? I had just finished reading all of his books , I said . He sat up very straight on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say anything . I had done some research on Abraham Gordon , I said , and was curious to find out more about him . ' " Merely curious , " I said . " Of course , " he said , giving me that strange look . I told him that some Brooklyn College acquaintances had recently informed me that Abraham Gordon had a niece who was a junior at Brooklyn College and was majoring in English literature . I had decided that I wanted to meet her and had managed to obtain an invitation to a party she was going to be at . The party was in two weeks . " It 's amazing what you can turn up sometimes with some hard research , " I said . " Yes it is , " Danny said . " What are you looking at me like that for ? " " Why did you start reading Abraham Gordon 's books ? " " I was curious . " " Only curious ? " " Ile 's a breath of fresh air . " " Whv do you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " More research ? " " Something like that . " " Do n't let Rav Kalman catch you doing research into Abraham Gordon . " " Do n't worry . " " Do you want some more coffee ? "  | " Not yet . " " I low is Rav Kalman ? " " A beauty . An absolute beauty . Yesterday it was the graduate school . A twenty-minute tirade against the graduate school . It teaches goyische subjects and should be abolished . Twenty minutes . I timed it . " " They wo n't abolish the graduate school because of Rav KalIilan . " I 'm a little tired of Rav Kalman . " " You 're tired of Rav Kalman , so you 're reading Abraham Gordon . " " That 's right . I need the fresh air . " " You 'll freeze to death in Abraham Gordon 's fresh air . " " I 'm choking to death with Rav Kalman . Listen , let 's not talk any more about Rav Kalman . It depresses me . Let 's talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics . No , you 're not interested in politics . Let 's talk about the movies . Have you seen any good movies lately ? " Danny said nothing . " All right , let 's talk about baseball . You think the Dodgers can take the pennant this year ? " He looked at me . " We talked enough about baseball years ago , " he said . We had played a rather frenzied game of baseball years back , he as first baseman for a team of Hasidic yeshiva students , me as second baseman and pitcher for my own yeshiva team  --  and his line drive to my head had put me into a hospital for five days and had almost cost me my left eye . That was how we had met . We were fifteen years old then . " I should have ducked , " I said . He had said that to me in the hospital . He laughed softly . " But I 'm glad I did n't , " I said . " Now I 'll have that other cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that stuff near the sink . And then I 'm going home . I need my sleep . I need to be  | fresh and alert for Rav Kalman . I need to be strong and fresh and alert so I can learn about all the dangers confronting Yiddishkeit . I take cream and two sugars . " " I remember what you take , " Danny said quietly . Two weeks later I met Rachel Gordon . There was a radiance about her , a luminous quality in her face and in the self-assured , poised way she carried herself . We went out together often , and sometimes she talked about Abraham Gordon and at other times I talked about Danny . We liked each other and thought the liking might come to mean-something in time . From Rachel I learned that Abraham Gordon traveled a great deal , lecturing to students in colleges and . universities throughout the country , played the violin , had turned down an invitation to teach logic at Harvard in order to enter the Zechariah Frankel Seminary as a rabbinical student , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logical positivists , found existentialism obscure , liked Hemingway as a writer and detested him as a person , and , before his heart attack at the age of forty-two , had been a wicked handball player . He had completely recovered from the heart attack , but he no longer played handball . Rachel and I had never really talked about her uncle 's son , Michael , before the night of the carnival . She would respond to the questions I put to her about her uncle , but never volunteered any information on her own . And I had never been interested enough in Michael to want to ask about him . Now I was very interested in Michael . They were having some kind of problem with him ; that much was clear enough . I had told Rachel . a great deal about Danny and the years we had been together : talking about him helped ease the ache of being without him . I realized now that she had been passing on all that information to her parents and her uncle . Now they wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danny about their problems with Michael . So the coming of Rav Kalman to Hirsch University had led me ) ooks of Abraham Gordon . And the books of Abraham had led me to Rachel and Michael . And because of  | Rachel and Michael , the Cordons wanted to meet Danny ** . I sat on the screened-in porch of the cottage and looked at the sunlight on the maple . It 's strange how many different shades of green there are , I thought . I sat there , looking at the maple and waiting for Abraham Gordon . 7 ' Four I Ic came promptly at ten o'clock . I heard the DcSoto pull up in front of the cottage and I had the front door open before he was halfway up the walk . He came quickly , a very tall , heavy-set man , broad-shouldered , thick-chested . His face was large and round and somewhat fleshy , not at all a good-looking face , with thick lips and a wide nose and thick dark eyebrows and balding dark hair . He wore dark trousers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown loafers . His gray eyes fixed on me and then his face broke into a broad smile and he came up the short flight of stairs two at a time and shook my hand . " The sailor , " he said . " Horatio Hornblower himself . It is good to meet you , Reuven . Where is your father ? Inside ? Is he still working on that book ? What a tan you 've got ! You do n't get that kind of tan from studying Talmud . " His handshake was warm and strong and his voice was deep and cheerful , and I felt myself a little overwhelmed by his immediate friendliness . The apprehension I had been feeling during the past hour of waiting was completely gone by the time I brought him out to the back porch to my father . They greeted each other as friends . My father had on his small black skullcap  --  he always wore his skullcap when he studied sacred texts or worked on the book  --  and I saw Abraham Gordon immediately pull a skullcap out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his balding head . I brought a chair over to the wooden table and Abraham Gordon sat down . " You 've lost weight , David , " he said affectionately to my father . " Yes , but I do not have a cold for a change . How are you , Abraham ? "  | " Exhausted . Europe was fine , Israel was an experience , and I 'm exhausted . " " I low is Kaufmann ? " " Lonely . But he 'll only admit it at the end of a three-hour walk . I lc asked to be remembered to you . They all asked to be remembcrcd to you . And they all asked about your book . " " With God 's help , the book will be published in January . Did you see Auerbach ? " " I saw everyone . They wish they were back on Scopus but they have settled into Terra Sancta .

In Israel I lived with my extra soul " ? he used the Hebrew expression ' nesha'mah yetairah , " " The flight back was terrible but I redeemed it by writing seven pages . David , I can not get over your son . Bialik could never have written ' Hamatmid ' if he had seen your son . " My father smiled . " Reuven is of the enlightened variety of yeshiva students . " " Such a category exists ? I will have to revise my hooks . David , listen , I must tell you of some of the things I found in the Vatican Library . There is a gold mine in that library . I was half an hour on the phone with Spiegel this morning about what I saw in that library " They spent the next forty minutes talking about rare medieval manuscripts and how sometimes you found one page of a manuscript in the Vatican Library and another page in the Bodleian and a third page in the Leningrad Library . They talked about scholars in Israel and America . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article coming out soon and was completing another volume . One man was finishing an important work on lob ; another was still at work on his history of the Jews in Spain ; a third would soon he publishing a definitive work on the Genizah fragments ; a fourth was contemplating a new translation into English of Maimonides 's Guide to the Perplexed ; a fifth was doing  | a book on Koheleth that would prove that the original had been in Aramaic and not in Hebrew ; a sixth was still at work on a critical edition of the Tosefta ; a seventh , a brilliant young man at the Hebrew University , was thinking of exploring the relationships that had existed between Jews and non-Jews ' during the early , pre-Crusade period in Europe . They talked on and on , and then my father 's mood changed abruptly and his eyes misted with sadness . How were things in Israel ? he asked quietly . Was the economic situation very bad ? Were the border incursions as serious as the newspapers reported them to be ? Things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no point in deluding ourselves . The border incursions were bad . The economy was bad . The immigrant camps were bad . But he was an optimist , a hopeless optimist . They would solve their problems . There had been worse problems . Every young country had problems . Did my father know what kind of problems America had when she was a young country ? Did my father know about the quarrels between the states after the Revolutionary War ? Did my father know about the Whiskey Rebellion ? Yes , my father knew . I went into the kitchen and brought out tea for my father and coffee for myself and Abraham Gordon , and I sat there , listening to them talk . A warm breeze blew gently across the lawn , stirring the leaves of the maple . I sat there and listened and after a long time Abraham Gordon finished his coffee and glanced at me briefly over the rim of his cup . The cup clinked softly as he replaced it on its dish on top of the wooden table . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his deep voice . " Now I must talk with the sailor . From my friend , the scholar , to his son , the sailor . Reuven , tell me about the carnival . I know all about it but I want to hear it again from you . Do you mind , David ? Thank you . From scholarship to carnivals is a jump , but I want to hear about this carnival . " I told him . He listened soberly , his thumb and forefinger rubbing the lobe of his car , a huge man , dwarfing the chair he sat in . Then I was clone . It had not taken very long . " Mv niece and her county fairs , " he muttered .  | " The advertising fooled us . It was n't her fault . " " You 're sure he cheated you . " " Absolutely . " " Tell me again about Michael after he lost his temper . " I told him . He nodded heavily . " I 'm grateful to you for stopping him . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He blanked out , you say . " " Yes . " " You talked to him and he did n't respond ? " " I think Rachel talked to him . " " And you 're absolutely sure you were cheated . " " Yes . Michael saw it too . You can ask Michael . " " Michael wo n't talk about the carnival . I can get nothing out of Michael . He acts as if it never happened . He seems to have blocked it out entirely . " " No , he remembers the carnival . He - does n't remember what happened after he lost his temper . But he remembers everything else . " He looked at me sharply . " how do you know ? " " He told me . " " When ? ? " Monday . When I took him sailing . He talked about it . " " What else did he talk about ? " I told him . " Michael told you all that ? " " Yes . " " While you were sailing ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked . " " Giordano Bruno . . . He read about him in an astronomy book this past winter . So , you tied up in a cove and talked . " He shook his head . " A sailor , a yeshiva boy , and a magician . David , you have a treasure here . Reuven , Michael does not like to talk about himself . - Michael has been to three therapists in the past fourteen months and each of them gave up on him after a few weeks . " My father 's eyes grew very wide .  | " Michael has been in therapy ? " I heard myself say . " IIas been . Yes . Has been . Three times . Michael resists therapy . I ) o you know what resisting therapy means ? " " Vaguely . " " Michael is a very sick young man . Any one of those therapists would give you a year 's earnings to find out how you got him to talk . I can not afford to give you a year 's earnings . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I did n't do anything . I took him sailing . " " Why did you take him sailing ? " " He was very upset by the carnival . I wanted him to do something he would enjoy . " " He enjoyed it . I can report to you that he enjoyed it . " " Reuven has experience in getting others to like him , " my father said quietly , giving me a sidelong glance . But Abraham Gordon had not heard him . He tugged at his ear lobe and sat lost in thought . Then he said , " What time is Daniel Saunders coming up to see you tomorrow ? " " In the morning , " I said . " I would like you to do me a favor , Reuven . I want to make you a messenger for a righteous deed . " He used the Talmudic term E  --  sb lea i mitzv4h . " " I would like you to ask Daniel Saunders to yrp come over and see us . Would you do that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Excuse me , Abraham . You know of Daniel Saunders ? " " I know of Daniel Saunders from rumors , from friends , and from Rachel . " " I Ic is ? " " I know who he is , David . I want to talk to him . I must talk to him . " Ile stopped tugging at his ear lobe and put his hand on the table and looked at me . " Tell him I want to talk to him . I would have called him anyway when we returned to the city . But since he 'll be with you tomorrow we might as well talk to him here . There will be a slight problem getting Michael out of the house ,  | but we 'll manage that somehow . Reuven , you 're a good sailor and a good Talmud student and a bit of a magician . Now be a persuader too and ask Daniel Saunders to come over and see us . " I told him I would talk to Danny . " Fine , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remember something , and sat back down again , heavily . He looked at me , his face suddenly taut . " You do n't think there will be a problem getting him to come ? " " No . Why should there be a problem ? " He gazed at me intently for a moment , then nodded and rose ponderously to his feet . " I 've got to get back . I promised to take Michael rowing before lunch . We have to discuss a telescope we 're going to build . David , finish your book . It was a pleasure seeing you again . I 'm only sorry I had to darken the pleasure with my private problems . Reuven , your father told me you like the questions I ask in my books . One day we 'll have to sit down and talk about that . But now I have to go rowing . " He shook hands with my father . " Walk me to the car , Reuven . " We came out of the cottage . He walked quickly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The street was deep in shade . I could hear the trees moving in the gentle wind . The air was redolent with flowers and freshly cut grass . We came up to the DeSoto . " About the carnival , " Abraham Gordon said . " I understand Michael owes you some money . " I looked up at him . I had to look up at him  --  he was a good five inches taller than I was . I told him Michael did n't owe me anything . " The money you loaned him . " I told him again Michael did n't owe me anything . IIc looked at me curiously . Then he smiled and nodded . " Come over this afternoon if you have a chance . Bring a sailboat . Michael would like to go out with you again . And my wife wants to meet you . " I told him I would be over .  | He removed the skullcap from his balding head , put it into a pocket , and climbed into the car . He looked at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . " Take care of your father , " he said . " There are n't many people like him around any more . " I watched the car go up the road and disappear around a curve , then I went back into the house and out to the porch . My father was seated at the wooden table , staring down at the galleys . " Everyone has burdens , " he murmured , shaking his head . " Who is without burdens ? " I said nothing . " I must get back to work , " my father said , speaking to himself . But he sat there , staring down at the galleys and doing nothing . I called Michael after lunch . He was happy when I told him I was coining over to take him sailing again . There was n't much of a wind , I said , but I would teach him how to control the mainsail and the tiller . That would make it a little more exciting . Were there any clouds ? I had n't looked out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were clouds . He laughed . I rented a Sailfish and took it across the lake . There were clouds now . But there was the sun too , hot and bright on my face and in my eyes . I tied up to the dock and heard loud voices and thumping sounds from the direction of the house . I came off the dock and went up the steep slope of the shoreline and around the house to the hack lawn . A net had been strung between two poles on a section of the lawn and there was a volleyball game going on , Joseph and Sarah Gordon on one side , Abraham Gordon and a woman I did not know  --  I assumed it was Ruth Gordon  --  on the other . Rachel was not around . Michael sat on a patio chair in the shade of the house , reading a book . He wore a bathing suit , a T shirt , and I saw he had tied his glasses around his head with a piece of string . I stood there , watching them play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his size ; he was playing the hack field and seemed to be everywhere at once , his long arms stretching for the ball , which he always sent to the woman who  | played in front of the net . He was dressed in shorts and tennis sneakers and was bare to the waist . His nakedness emphasized his hugeness . The woman on his side of the net wore white shorts and a white polo shirt and dark glasses . She was a striking woman , tall , slender , lithe , with short chestnut hair and beautifully proportioned features , and she moved'about in front of the net with the agile grace of a natural athlete , twisting , turning , pivoting , spiking the ball over the net , carefully avoiding even those balls she could return by herself in order to let Abraham Gordon set them up for her . The two of them played together as a tight team , each seeming to anticipate instinctively the movements of the other , and Joseph and Sarah Gordon appeared to be not too much of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard for each point they scored . Joseph Gordon saw me . He saw me as he was preparing himself to return a sharp serve heading his way from the arm of his brother , and he caught the ball instead and sang out , " The captain of the S.S. Maher ! " Abraham Gordon introduced me to his wife . She removed her sunglasses and I saw she had blue eyes , deep blue , Michael 's eyes . She wore no make-up . She offered me her hand and greeted me in a deep contralto voice . " Michael speaks of you as though you were his brother , " she said . " I 'm very pleased . " I did n't know what to say to that , so I smiled and said nothing . " I was wondering if you and your father were related to Henry Malter . " " No . " " Do you know who I mean ? " " The author of the critical edition of Ta'anit . " " You are not related . " " No . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . Was it shortened ? " " Yes . From Maltovsky . " " Your father is from Russia ? "  | " Yes . " " And he shortened his name ? " Her manner was friendly but somewhat formal and distant . " Ile lived with a cousin when he first came here . His cousin convinced him to shorten it . " " What is his cousin 's name ? " " He 's dead . We have no living relatives . " " I see . " " Reuven , " Joseph Gordon said , " how about joining us for some volleyball ? " He was standing next to Ruth Gordon , smiling and tossing the ball from hand to hand . " Reuven has come to go sailing with Michael , " Ruth Gordon said . " I need help , " Joseph Gordon said . " Nothing will help you , " Abraham Gordon said cheerfully . He wiped his brow with the back of his forearm . His body was covered with sweat . " Let not him that girds on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Joseph Gordon quoted in Sephardic Hebrew from the First Book of Kings . Abraham Gordon laughed . " Where 's Rachel ? " I asked . " Inside the house , " Sarah Gordon said unhappily . " Roaming through Ithaca , " Joseph Gordon said . " I could have used her . " " I told you , " Abraham Gordon said . " Nothing will help . " " She ought to be out in the sun on a day like this , " Sarah Gordon said . " But she 's inside the house . " Ruth Gordon . gazed over at Michael , who was sitting in the shade of the patio overhang , absorbed in his book . " Michael , " she called . Michael looked up immediately , startled . " Reuven has come to take you sailing . " Michael looked at me and his pale face lighted up . " You have made a sailor out of my son , " Ruth Gordon said to inc.  | I saw Michael carefully insert a bookmark into place and put the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smiling . " Hello , " he said to me . " Did you bring a Sailfish again ? " " Yes . " Ruth Gordon was watching her son intently . " Can we go out right away ? " Michael asked . I looked at Ruth and Abraham Gordon . " Go ahead , " said Abraham Gordon . " Have a good time , dear , " Ruth Gordon said to her son . " Scram , you two , " Abraham Gordon said . " I want to finish trouncing my brother on the field of battle . " " A ruthless warrior , " Joseph Gordon said . Abraham Gordon laughed and wiped his brow again with his forearm . " No Geneva Conventions here , " Joseph Gordon said . Michael and I walked back across the lawn and the patio to the lake . Just before we started down the slope I turned and saw Ruth Gordon still standing on the lawn , watching us . She turned quickly and went toward the net . We sailed for close to two hours and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while with the mainsail sheet and the tiller but the breeze was mild and we did not capsize and finally he caught on to it and we sailed smoothly . We did not go into any of the coves ; we sailed , tacking back and forth in the warm breeze . I lay near the center board but the water was smooth and I did not have much to do . I closed my eyes and felt the gentle rolling of the Sailfish and the sun on my face . I felt myself drowsy and falling asleep and opened my eyes and looked up at Michael . It seemed his own private sun shone out from behind his eyes . He looked at me and smiled , then looked up at the clouds . I saw him looking at the clouds and I closed my eyes and lay very still . I opened my eyes and saw him still looking at the clouds . " What do you see ? " I asked him . " Clouds . " " Only clouds ? " " Clouds and things . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Clouds and stars in the daytime ? " " I had a dream last Monday night . We were sailing and we sailed off the lake and into the sky and there were clouds and stars and I showed you the constellations . We sailed between the stars along the outlines of the constellations . It was a good dream . " " Do you have many dreams ? " " Yes . But I do n't like to talk about them . " " Why ? " " I just do n't . " " All right . " " Is a friend of yours coming up tomorrow for a visit ? " I looked at him . " I heard them talking . They said a friend of yours would be coming over tomorrow . " " Yes . " " I 'd like to meet him . But they want me to go to a movie or something . Why wo n't they let me meet him ? " " I do n't know . " ? There 's something going on . I don't. know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was quiet . " That was a good dream , " he said . " I really liked that dream . " We sailed smoothly and in silence and off in the distance was the faint line of the horizon and about one hundred yards to starboard were the trees of the shoreline , the woods through which I walked from the cottage to Rachel 's house , and the lake glistened like satin in the sunlight and Michael being ill seemed unreal . Later , tacking toward shore , I looked up and saw a figure in white on the dock . We were very far away and I could not tell who it was . It went quickly along the dock and up the stairway and into the house . Afterward , we all sat in the living room and there were cold drinks and pleasant talk and much joking about the volleyball  | game in which Rachel 's parents had been trounced , and Ruth Gordon smoked a cigarette and talked about the museums they had seen in Europe  --  she talked about art as if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's courses at Brooklyn College ? : Ind the indecent way the French had of ignoring you unless you spoke French , and thank heaven they both spoke French , and the poverty in the back alleys of Rome and the rooted aristocratic loveliness  --  those were her words  --  of Oxford and Cambridge . The living room was large , rambling , with brightly colored Navajo rugs on the floor and a high vaulted ceiling . Bookcases covered part of one wall and Sarah Gordon 's huge abstract paintings hung on the wall opposite . The side of the room facing the lake was all glass , sliding doors opening onto the porch . Sunlight streamed through the wide expanse of glass , and the bright summer furniture and the rugs and the paintings gave depth and brilliance to the room  --  and the talk gave it warmth . They were a close family , and , of course , not awed , as I was , by the fame and notoriety of Abraham Gordon . ' I'hcyteased him good-naturedly about how he had misplaced the passports on the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had let himself be fleeced by a taxi driver in Naples . Yet there was a faint aura of ... darkness about them too , a hint of strain to the cheerfulness ; a sense of foreboding seeped through the occasional lapses in their talk . Michael sat quietly , listening and sipping at a Coke . Rachel came into the room sometime between the misplaced passports and the airsickness over the Alps . She had on her reading glasses and looked bleary-eyed . Flow was Leopold Bloom ? I asked her . Unhappy , she said . He had lost his Stephen . Tie was a star in the constellation of Cassiopeia . But Molly Bloom ? Molly Bloom was something else . Molly Bloom was recumbent and big with seed . And she , Rachel , would drink to that with a Coke because she was practically done with Ithaca . Ruth Gordon said that Rachel should be thankful she had n't decided to do her paper on the Penelope section . Abraham Gordon laughed . Joseph Gordon grinned around the pipe he held between his teeth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarah Gordon gave him a  | sharp glance and nodded her head in the direction of Michael , who clearly had n't the slightest notion of what they were talking about . Later , Rachel walked with me down the dock to the Sailfish . She knew what my father and I had talked about with her uncle that morning . They all knew . They were grateful . What time did I think Danny would be able to come over tomorrow ? I told her I did n't know and would have to call her after my father and I talked to Danny . Then I told her that her aunt was one of the most beautiful women I had ever seen . She nodded absently . She was still wearing her reading glasses and they gave her a schoolteacher look . " What does she do ? " I asked . " My aunt ? She takes care of my uncle and Michael . " " No , seriously . " " I meant it seriously . She edits my uncle 's books . She edits them , types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the footnotes , and sees to it that everything gets published correctly . In between she worries about Michael and about my uncle having another heart attack one day . " " He 'll have another heart attack if he keeps playing volleyball like that . " " The volleyball is exercise . On doctor 's orders . It was a mild heart attack anyway . Reuven , please call me as soon as you know when Danny will be over . " I promised I would . " Take off your glasses . Why do you wear your glasses when you 're not reading ? " " I did n't even know I had them on . " " Molly Bloom big with seed can make you forget anything , " I said . She laughed . I took the Sailfish back across the lake . My father was on the porch . I-Ic sat at the wooden table , staring cent at the sunlight on the lawn and the maple . I low were the galleys coming along ? I asked him . I lc did not look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There  | were some errors with the Greek words , and he had had to revise some passages that seemed a little obscure now that he was reading them in print . Otherwise , the galleys were fine . He spoke quietly , his voice sounding hoarse . I could begin checking the footnotes and the variant readings as soon as we returned to the city , he said . Ile would call the librarian at the Zechariah Frankel Seminary . There would be no problem obtaining permission for me to use the rare manuscripts . He was silent a moment . His face was pale , unusually pale , even for him . " We did not even talk about the Dead Sea Scrolls , " he murmured . I was quiet . " I meant to ask him about the Dead Sea Scrolls . " He sat there , looking at the sunlight on the lawn and the maple . Danny arrived the next day a little before lunch . He was tired . IIe looked haggard and he yawned repeatedly during lunch and said he had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all he wanted now was a year of sleep . He had never been up to the cottage before and he gazed hungrily at the lawn and the maple . The maple looked inviting , he said . He could easily sleep a year in the shade of that maple . Maybe he would even go down to the lake later on , he said . But first he wanted to sleep . It had been a bad emergency with a schizophrenic boy . I had never seen him so tired . But after lunch my father and I took him out to the porch and the three of us talked for a while . Sure he would see Professor Gordon , Danny said . If we wanted him to see Professor Gordon . . . he kept glancing at me . He was wide awake now . I called Rachel . She would come over for Danny . It would be a while before she could get to the cottage . She would have to drive her mother and Michael to a movie in Peekskill first . They had found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up Danny on the way back . She sounded a little frantic . - It was almost an hour before I heard the DcSoto . I opened the front door and saw Rachel getting out of the car . I called to her to stay where she was . She closed the car door and looked at me through the open side window . Danny and I went down the walk . I introduced them . I saw Rachel glance at the small black  | skullcap on Danny 's head and at his face . She seemed tense and weary . Danny slid into the front seat beside her . I watched them drive off . IIe was gone more than three hours . I sat on the porch , trying to study Talmud . Then I tried reading The New York Times . Then I did some problems in symbolic logic . The sun paled behind thin , high clouds and the air grew cool . My father went inside for a sweater . He stared a while at the maple and the lawn before he returned to the galleys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the galleys inside and was working at the kitchen table by the time I heard the DeSoto pull up in front of the cottage . I came down the walk and saw Danny and Rachel sitting in the front seat , talking . They looked at me as I came up to the car . Neither of them said anything . Danny climbed out of the car . Rachel gave me a nod and a pale smile and drove off toward Peekskill . " Well ? " I said to Danny . He said nothing . The lines of his face were tight . We came into the cottage . " You were there a long time . " " There was a lot to talk about . " " Can you tell me about it ? " " Yes . " My father looked up from the galleys as we entered the kitchen . The three of us sat around the table . Outside the sky was bleak with clouds . A cold breeze blew across the lawn . " Were you able to be of help ? " my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you permitted to talk about it ? " " They said I could tell you everything . But they do n't want you to tell anyone else . " " Of course , " my father said . " What did you talk about for three hours ? " I asked . " Michael . "  | " Just Michael ? " " And the treatment center . " I stared at him . I saw my father stare at him . " They wanted to know all about the treatment center , " Danny said . " What for ? " " They want to put Michael in . " " Into the treatment center ? " " Yes . " " My God , " I said . " Michael is that sick ? " my father asked . " Yes . " " I 've been with him for weeks , " I said . " I never saw him that sick . " " He 's very sick . He brcaks things . He burns books . He shattered his telescope a week before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in school . And he resists therapy . That 's always an indication of something very deep-seated and serious . They 've been told he might harm himsQlf . They 're very frightened . They thought the summer would help and he would change . They were deluding themselves , they realize that now . I 'm going to talk to the administrator and my supervisor . There 's a procedure everyone has to go through . But they 're ready to start immediately . " " Lreversaw it . " I felt my hands cold with icy sweat . " I never saw any of that in Michael . " " Yes you did , " Danny said quietly . But you did n't know what you were seeing . He was moody and subdued all during supper . Yes , he would be in the same apartment next year , he said , in response to my father 's question . It was a good apartment . They had promised to replace the worn linoleum and to give it a fresh coat of paint . He would be going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treatment center . I told him I hoped he would be opening his window . He smiled bleakly . I asked him if he had ever read any of Abraham Gordon 's books .  | Yes , he had read his books , he said . He could n't think of any books he disagreed with adore . " Abraham Gordon is a great scholar , " my father said . Danny said he was n't questioning Abraham Gordon 's scholarship , only his theology . " I understand how you feel , Danny , " my father said . " But Abraham Gordon has achieved something that is remarkable . To develop a theology for those who can no longer believe literally in God and revelation and who still wish to remain observant and not abandon the tradition  --  that is a remarkable achievement . " Danny said he did n't have that kind of a problem . He left shortly after supper . He had not rested at all . He looked tired to the point of exhaustion . I sat at the kitchen table with my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did they pick that treatment center ? " I said . He looked up from the galleys . " Why did they pick the treatment center where Danny is working ? " " They know of Danny . " " So what ? Do you know how many good therapists there are in New York ? What do they want with Danny ? " My father was silent a moment . " Reuven , did you ever mention to Rachel how Danny was raised ? " " Of course not . " " She knows nothing of the silence ? " " Absolutely nothing . " From the time Danny was about six or seven until the end of his last year in college , Reb Saunders , Danny 's father , had deliberately created a barrier of silence between himself and his son , except when they studied Talmud together . He was frightened of Danny 's cold brilliance ; he wanted to teach his son what it meant to suffer . Danny had suffered , all right . I did not understand what connection there could be bet wccn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . 1 lc did not respond . " This is n't a coincidence , " I said . " You heard what Professor  | Gordon said . They were planning to talk to Danny anyway . What do they want with Danny ? " " I have no idea , " my father said . He looked at me curiously for a moment , then went back to working on the galleys . Rachel called me later that evening . They had had a good talk with Danny . Her aunt and uncle were deeply grateful . Did I know what a kind and warm and sympathetic friend I had ? How was Michael ? I wanted to know . Moody , she said . He knew something was going on that had to do with him , but he had no idea what it was . " We had an awful time getting him out of the house , " she said . " He kept saying he wanted to meet Reuven 's friend . " " When are they going to tell him ? " She did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were going back to the city tomorrow . Her uncle was impatient now to start the procedure for getting Michael admitted . Danny had really overwhelmed them a little with his warmth and the patient way he had answered their questions . Where had I found such a friend ? she asked . " On a baseball field . " I heard her laugh softly into the phone . " You should have ducked , " she said . I had told her about the'baseball game . She was imitating Danny 's faintly nasal voice . " Is n't that what he said ? You should have ducked . " I told her she had a very good memory . " How come your mother took Michael ? " She had volunteered . There had been no one else to go . " Why did n't you go ? " - " I wanted to meet Danny , " she said . Then she said , " My mother has an awful headache from that double feature . " " Messengers for good deeds are never injured , ' " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in storybooks , " she said , and we said good night . Abraham Gordon called early the next morning . My father spoke with him briefly , then gave me the phone . He had called to thank us again , he said . He and his wife were taking Michael home  | page deleted  | " I do n't know what they 're planning . I wish they would tell me what they 're planning . " Rachel called me about half an hour later . Michael had gone home with his parents . Her father was driving them home . Could I come over in the afternoon and keep her company ? She was not feeling too well , she said . We spent the afternoon together . The next day my father finished checking the galleys . For the first time that summer he went down to the beach and spent an afternoon-in tthe sun . On the Sunday before Labor Day my father and I went over to Rachel 's house . The five of us were together on the patio most of the afternoon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the patio and was filling a large canvas with a blinding mixture of colors . She wore a pair of old shorts and a paint-encrusted blouse , and she daubed energetically at the canvas , the palette in one hand , a brush in the other . My father and Joseph Gordon talked gloomily about Senator McCarthy . Rachel and I watched Sarah flinging colors onto the canvas . It was good to be painting again , she said . She had n't painted all summer . She had n't quite been herself all summer . It was very good to he able to paint again . Later , there was a barbecue . Joseph Gordon stood away from the smoke pouring from the white coals , his pipe between his teeth , tending zealously to the steaks and all the while continuing to talk with my father . It was a very friendly day . We did not once mention Michael . That night Rachel and I swam together off the dock . It was a warm night and . the sky was black and jeweled with stars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that illumined the stairway and the dock and a hundred yards of water . The water too was warm and we swam for a long time and later we sat on the dock and let the night dry us off and there were the pulsing sounds of frogs and crickets and the vaulting darkness overhead and the sense of the summer ending . " Is Danny really very religious ? " I heard Rachel ? " " I 've never asked him . " " I do n't know anything about Hasidism , " she said . We were silent awhile . The lake lapped gently against the shore . " Rcuven , " Rachel said quietly . " Yes . " " What have we learned about ourselves this summer ? " " That we 're good friends . " " Yes , " she murmured . " Very good friends . " " Yes " And that Molly Bloom is big with seed . " She laughed and softly , very softly , kissed my cheek . The next afternoon Rachel and her parents closed up the house and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packing our bags . By noon the next day we were back in the city . Williamsburg was stifling , narcotized by the heat . Our first-floor brownstone apartment felt drained of air . I went quickly through the rooms , opening windows . The apartment seemed suddenly strangely small . Manya , our Russian housekeeper , returned the next morning . She gave me a hug that left my ribs aching and kept telling me in broken English how wonderful I looked , I had gotten so tan ; but why was my father so pale , why had n't he been out in the sun more ? Her graying hair was combed straight back from her forehead and braided into a large bun on the top of her head . She talked excitedly with my father in Russian for a few minutes . Then she put on her apron . I could hear the sounds of her man-sized shoes as she moved about , cleaning the apartment . The heat continued . Williamsburg baked and broiled in it ; the asphalt-paved streets softened in it ; the sycamores on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shade alongside the houses and stores of Lee Avenue in vain attempts to avoid it . That Friday morning I traveled to the Zechariah Frankel Seminary ' and began to work on my father 's galleys . Ten days later , on a londav , I returned to school .  | I called Rachel almost every day during September . There was a great deal of trouble convincing Michael to enter the residential treatment center , more trouble than anyone had anticipated . His parents went through all the preliminary interviews and were told by the staff people at the center that Michael ought to be admitted . An interview was set up for Michael with the chief of clinical services for the fourth Monday in September . On the afternoon of the Shabbat before the interview his parents told him what they were planning . He was terrified . He became hysterical . He would not go . He screamed that he would not go . They called the chief of clinical services and he talked to Michael over the phone . Michael went for the interview . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , however , he became hysterical again . He would not go . He was n't crazy , he screamed . He would not go to a place where people were crazy . What were they trying to do to him ? He would never go to a place like that . Abraham Gordon called the chief of clinical services . They talked a long time over the phone . Then Abraham Gordon told his son that an interview would be set up between him and Danny Saunders , Reuven 's friend . Yes , Reuven 's friend worked there . Would Michael see Reuven 's friend ? Michael and Danny spent almost two hours alone on a morning in the first week of October . In the second week of October , two days after Yom Kippur , Michael entered the residential treatment center .  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | I told him I did n't know and would ask him when I saw him again . But I did not see Danny for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next I had completely forgotten about the Kotzker Rebbe . My days at school had settled into their normal routine : Talmud in the mornings and the early afternoons with Rav Kalman ; philosophy courses in the graduate school on some late afternoons and evenings . I suffered patiently through Rav Kalman 's periodic tirades during the early part of the fall and by November found them repetitious and dull . He was a great Talmudist , but I had nothing to do with him outside the classroom . I wanted no personal relationship with Rav Kalman . The last batch of galleys for my father 's book came at the end of September . I worked on them steadily in the rare-manuscript room of the Zechariah Frankel Library . My father sent them back in the third week of October . The book was done . My father roamed around the house for a week , looking like a man who was searching for something he had lost . Then , slowly , he returned to his Zionist activities . The book was due to be published in the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for mailing to various scholarly journals by the middle of December . My father waited for the book as he had once waited for the news of the end of the Second World War and for the Declaration of Independence of the State of Israel . One afternoon in October I met Professor Abraham Gordon in the manuscript room of the Zechariah Frankel Library . He was seated at one of the small tables , peering through a magnifying glass at a manuscript written in Arabic . A black skullcap sat on top of his balding head . I came over to him , and he was glad to see me . Ile put down the glass and shook my hand and waved me into a chair . How was my father and was the book finished and why Iiad n't I come to talk to him ? I asked him about Michael . Michael was doing as well as could be expected , he said , repeating the words that became the liturgical response to every question I asked ; about Michael that fall . We talked softly so as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I seen the latest attack against him in the ( h t hodox press ? he asked cheerfully , and named an Orthodox  | weekly published in Brooklyn . I told him I hardly ever read the Orthodox press . He smiled . The writer had called him a pagan . He laughed , and a bearded gentleman sitting at a nearby table threw him an annoyed look . " They are running out of names to call me , " he said in a whisper . He was trying to sound cheerful , but he looked worn . His round , heavy face seemed to have taken on additional lines . " Give my warmest regards to your father , " he said . I went home , wondering why I had once been so eager to meet him . Rav Kalman really was not too difficult to endure after all . There seemed nothing unusual about that fall , and yet everything about it was strange , faintly distorted and askew , as if the summer had somehow affected the delicate mechanism of balance inside my ears . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackened them with their dark caftans and dark suits and dark fur-trimmed hats . The Festival of Succoth came and a jungle of palm fronds and citrons moved about the streets . Simchat Torah came and there was dancing and singing into the night and the streets swarmed with gyrating Hasidim embracing the Torah scrolls and singing their joy to the dark sky . I had seen it all before ; there should have been nothing strange about it now . And yet it all seemed strange , and I did not know why . I told myself it was because we were in a time of waiting : for my father 's book , for news about Michael , for my ordination . But I did not really know why . Then there was another long Indian summer , and finally the leaves began to fall . All during those last weeks of August it had seemed as if the separate lines of our lives were being manipulated somehow , purposefully and carefully brought together by some master weaver . Now it seemed the weaver had wearied of his game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly into the mist and smoke of autumn .  | The twilight weeks came to an abrupt end in early December with a classroom conversation and a phone call . December was cold , but without the snow and the sleet that often invade New York before the technical coming of winter . ' I'he leaves were gone from the sycamores but there was bright sunlight and clear skies , and I enjoyed the bus rides to school in the early mornings through the waking streets . The school stood on Bedford Avenue a few blocks from Eastern Parkway . The rabbinical and college departments were housed in a whitcstone building that fronted directly onto Bedford Avenue . Alongside were the half-dozen brownstones that comprised the various graduate departments . It was a busy , asphalt-paved street , noisy with traffic and crowded with shoppers who frequented the many stores directly across the street from the school . Even with the windows closed the sounds of the street came into the classrooms : the roar of accelerating buses , the loud hum of wheels , the blare of automobile horns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog . The whitestone building had six stories . For four years I had climbed up and down the stairs of that building to get to my various college classes . Now almost everything I needed was on the street floor . To the left of the large marble lobby beyond the stone stairs and the metal double door of the school was a long , narrow , tiled corridor . Along the right side of this corridor were the doors that led to the school synagogue , which stood parallel to the corridor , with the Ark against the far right wall and fixed pews taking up half the length of the huge floor . The rest of the synagogue was filled with chairs and long tables . From nine to twelve every morning  --  except Friday and Shabbat when we had  | no classes , and Sunday when we had a different schedule  --  I sat at one of those tables with some of my classmates and prepared for my Talmud class , or shiur , as these classes are called . At noon I went down one flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , from one to three in the afternoon , I attended the shiur given by Rav Kalman  --  in the classroom directly across the corridor from the synagogue . On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons I left the shiur at three o'clock and took a Bedford Avenue bus to a nearby synagogue where I taught Hebrew school . On Monday and Wednesday I came out of the whitestone building and went into the adjoining three-story brownstone for my graduate philosophy classes . It was a fine arrangement . During my last year in college I had attended the shiur given by Rav Gershenson . He was a kind , gentle person in his late sixties , with a long , pointed gray beard , brown eyes , and a soft , often barely audible voice . He was the greatest Orthodox scholar of Talmud in the United States . He was also a magnificent teacher , and often I would sit in awe , watching the thrusting gyrations of his hands as they danced through the air , thumbs extended and carving invisible circles of emphasis for the explanations with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did not know anyone who had ever been in his class who did not speak of him with respect and love . Then Rav Jacob Kalman entered the school and was given the Chullin shiur . The Talmud tractate Chullin deals with the laws of ritual slaughter and with the dietary laws . A thorough knowledge of this tractate is one of the requirements for Orthodox ordination . I entered Rav Kalman 's shiur . No one seemed to know anything about Rav Kalman beyond the facts that he had been a teacher in one of the great yeshivoth in Vilna before the Second World War and had spent two years in a German concentration camp in northern Poland . But during the first few months after his arrival at Hirsch the corridors and the cafeteria buzzed with all kinds of rumors about him : his wife and three daughters had been shot by Storm Troopers in front of his eyes in a wood outside of Warsaw ; he had escaped from a concen- tration camp , been caught , and escaped again ; he had crossed the Polish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . One rumor had it that he had organized a group of Orthodox Jewish partisans that specialized in blowing up the tracks of German trains carrying Jews to the concentration camps . Another rumor had it that he had been concealed in a bunker for more than a year by a Polish farm family , had been discovered , had been forced to watch the execution of the family , and had somehow escaped again . He was said to have made his way across northern Russia into Siberia and from there to Shanghai , where he had waited out the war under the eyes of the Japanese , who were not possessed of Hitler 's feelings toward Jews and who left the few Jews under their rule alone . According to this version of the life of Rav Kalman , he was brought to America by the administration of Ilirsch University and Was promptly invited to teach in the rabbinical departmentmere were seventeen students in my class . The room in which we attended Rav Kalman 's shiur was large , with light-green walls , a high white ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite the door was comprised of tall , wide windows that faced Bedford Avenue . On clear days the sun streamed through those windows  --  but it made little difference , for the room was always pervaded by the peculiar darkness that Rav Kalman brought with him whenever he came through the door . He seemed to radiate darkness . He was short but stockily built . He had a full black beard and dark eyes and thick black hair . His face was quite pale and contrasted sharply with the blackness of his beard . He wore a long black coatlike jacket that reached to just above the knees , a starched white shirt , a black tie , sharply pressed black trousers , black shoes , and a tall , shiny black skullcap . Ile was an angry , impatient , sarcastic teacher . I had had angry teachers before , but their anger had always been accompanied by a redeeming humor . There was nothing humorous about Rav Kalman . Ilo rarely sat still behind his desk . He paced . I would watch liini pace back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the blackboard , going to the windows ,  | turning , going to the opposite wall near the door , turning , going back to the windows . Sometimes he would stop at the windows and incline his head and close his eyes for a moment , as if he were listening to an invisible voice  --  and I would see him nod his head . Then he would turn and continue his pacing . He smoked incessantly , waiting until the cigarettes were almost ashes in his fingers before dropping them into the ashtray on his desk . His voice was loud and high-pitched ; often at the end of a shiur I had the feeling that a sudden silence had descended upon the school . His classes left me drained , nerveless , tense . During our first week with him the year before , we had quickly realized that a student 's request for further clarification of a passage , or the normal barrage of questions with which we had always confronted our Talmud teachers in the past , was now laden with danger . Two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked him about a passage we were studying that seemed to me to be clearly contradicted by another passage I had suddenly remembered from a different tractate . He stopped pacing and fixed his dark eyes on me and tugged at his beard . He did not simply stroke his beard ; he took strands of hair between the thumb and forefinger of his right hand , and tugged . " A contradiction , " he muttered . " Malter has found a contradiction . " I tensed in my seat . " Tell me , Matter , have you studied the " ? he named an obscure late-medieval commentary no one in the class ever paid attention to ? " on the inyan ? You have not ? If you would have studied that commentary , you would not find your contradiction . Come better prepared , Malter . You will find fewer contradictions . " lie did not answer my question . My father solved the problem for me that night by a simple emendation of the text in the other tractate . But I would not dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talmudic passages as practiced by those who studiedTahnud in the modern , scientific manner was unheard of in my school We had no way of knowing how Rav Kalman might react to any of our questions , and I had no desire to become the target of his sarcasm . So I stopped asking questions . I read without errors  | whenever I was called on , answered all his questions correctly , and contributed nothing on my own to the class . A Talmud class in which a student is fearful of asking questions can ' become a suffocating experience . I suffocated . His tirades were frightening . He talked about Hollywood as the symbol of American values ; he ranted against a new instrument of horror called television ; there was little about America he seemed to like . On occasion his tirades were based upon events occurring in the school . Students and teachers were attacked by name . A projected college course in Greek mythology was canceled because he labeled it paganism . A student was almost expelled because he caught him outside the school without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which girls had always been invited , was called off because he waged a vitriolic campaign against girls sitting together with boys in the yeshiva auditorium . The whole year was like that . In somewhat cynical fashion we referred to those tirades as musar messages . ' ' Musar " is the Hebrew term for ethics or a lecture exhorting one to ethical living . There had been a great musar movement among Jews in Eastern Europe , particularly in Lithuania , during the latter part of the last century and in the decades before the Second World War . Much about that movement had been quite ennobling . But there was nothing ennobling about Rav Kalman 's musar messages . ' They were delivered with sarcasm and anger , and one is rarely ennobled by such exhortations . It had taken a considerable effort on my part over the past months of autumn to grow accustomed to his tirades . But I had finally succeeded . At the onset of a tirade I would slump down in my scat . I sat in the last row of the class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would notice that almost immediately . So I would look straight at him , moving my head to keep him in view as he paced back and forth  --  and not listen to his words . I would do a logic problem in my head ; one part of me would be seeing to it that I kept looking directly at him ; the other part would be doing a logic problem , or thinking of Michael and Danny and Rachel , or conjuring up images of the huge presses that were ! milling off my father 's book . There was a numbing sameness to  | those tirades , and by the end of November I discovered I could t urn them off with ease and still convey the impression that I was listening . Then on the Monday morning of the first week of December he began to talk about something he had never mentioned before in class , and I found myself listening once again to his words . We were studying the ninth chapter of Chullin , which deals with various kinds of uncleanness that can result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the students was reading the text and explaining as he went along . The class was absolutely silent , except for the lone voice of the student . Rav Kalman paced back and forth behind his desk , smoking . He had called on the student to read at the beginning of the class , and then had not said a word . The student had been reading and explaining for almost a quarter of an hour . Rav Kalman remained silent . He stopped at the window for a while and peered out at the street . He closed his eyes and inclined his head and seemed to be listening to something . Then he resumed his pacing . I kept my eyes on the text  --  all of us kept our eyes on the text when someone was reading  --  but I could hear him pacing back and forth . Then the pacing suddenly stopped . I glanced up . He was standing behind his desk . Others were looking at him now too . I could feel the class go tense . The student who had been reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and started to set up a logic problem in my head . I slumped down in my seat . " Read , " Rav Kalman said . " Who told you to stop ? Continue reading . Explain again the words of Rabbi Ychuda . . . Yes . Go on . Go on . What does Tosefos say about the comment of Rashi ? . . . Yes . Continue reading . " I sat up in my seat and looked down at the text . The student went on reading and explaining . Outside , Bedford Avenue was bathed in sunlight and thick with traffic . Inside , the room was filled with its normal atmosphere of oppressive tension . Rav Kalman stood silently behind his desk , smoking a cigarette . Abruptly , without warning , he broke into the words of the student who was reading . The student stopped immediately .  | " If the body is made unclean by contact with the smallest of things that is unclean , " Rav Kalman said in Yiddish , " how much more so is it made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I started to work on my logic problem . he did not pace . He stood stiffly behind his desk . " In America , everything is called Yiddishkeit , " Rav Kalman said . " A Jew travels to synagogue on Shabbos in his car , that is called Yiddishkeit . A Jew eats ham but gives money to philanthropy , that is called Yiddishkeit . A Jew prays three times a year but is a member of a synagogue , that is called Yiddishkeit . Judaism " ? he pronounced the word in English , contemptuously : Joodah-seism ? " everything in America calls itself Judaism . " IIe put his cigarette into the ashtray and looked at me across the room . " Arc you listening , Malter ? " I nodded , without losing the thread of the logic problem . Outside , a car horn blared noisily , the sound strangely loud in the stillness of the room . Rav Kalman took a pack of cigarettes from a pocket of his long jacket and put a cigarette between his lips . He lit it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke from his nostrils . 1Ie took the cigarette from his lips and looked at me intently . " In America there are schools that teach Judaism , " he said , talking to the class and looking at mc . " The students do not wear skullcaps and the teachers do not believe in Torah from heaven , and they teach Judaism . " His voice was low but edged with contempt . " Judaism , " he said . " Everything in America is Judaism . I dropped the logic problem and sat up straight in my chair . Ilc was still looking at me . " What would you say of such a school , Malter ? " I stared at him and said nothing . " I low would you describe such a school , Malter ? Is there a word for such a school ? " I saw some of my classmates glancing at me . This was the first time Rav Kalman had ever turned one of his tirades into a  | question-and-answer affair . I sat very rigidly in my seat , and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice suddenly angry . " Unclean . Such a school is unclean . And whoever has contact with it becomes unclean himself . " Then he began pacing back and forth behind the desk and talking , not looking at us any more , but still talking . " Such a school is a falsehood . It is worse than a falsehood . It is a desecration of the Name of God . Do you hear ? A desecration of the Name of God . It is a perversion . Where is the holiness in such a school ? The Bible they change whenever they do not understand what they read . //I ' fie Gemora " ? he used the traditional synonym for the Talmud , though the Gemora , or Gemara , as I pronounced it , is actually only one part of the Talmud ? " the Gemora they change . Whatever they do not like , they change . Where is the holiness in such a school ? " He went on like that for a few more minutes . Then he carefully put out his cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such a school is unclean . And whoever sets foot in it becomes unclean . Remember what I tell vou . Now read further . Who was reading ? Goldberg . Read . Read . " Two seats in front of me , the student who had been reading earlier began to read again . I looked at my hands on top of the open Talmud . They were trembling . I did not hear a single word of what went on during the rest of that class session . I sat there in a frightened daze , wondering whether Rav Kalman 's words had been deliberately directed at me or had simply been an accident of timing that had somehow managed to coincide closely with the weeks I had spent at the Zechariah Frankel Seminary working on my father 's book . But the way he had looked at me . . I did not think it was a . coincidence . I found out soon enough . Chairs scraped noisily and I came out of my daze . The room began to empty quickly . IIardly anyone ever stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I started for the door . I wanted to get out of there . I heard someone call my name . I thought it was one of the students and I ignored him . I was almost at the door when someone tugged at the sleeve of my jacket . Rav Kalman wanted to talk to me , a classmate said ,  | giving me a wide-eyed look . I turned and went back into the room . Rav Kalman was standing behind his desk , smoking another cigarette and gazing at me . I came over to him . Standing close to him , I could see the dark circles beneath his eyes and the long diagonal line of a white scar on his right cheek . He smelled strongly of tobacco . He took the cigarette from his mouth , placed it in the ashtray , and gazed at me intently . He tugged at his beard . " Malter , you understood what I said concerning schools for Judaism ? " he asked in Yiddish . I told him I had understood . I spoke in English . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class . My Yiddish was very poor . I used English . " You know which school I meant ? " " No , " I said . " You do not know ? " He looked at me intently . His eyes narrowed . he swayed back and forth on his legs . " Malter , tell me . You know Gordon ? " " Which Gordon ? " I heard myself ask . " Which Gordon , " he repeated with a faintly mocking smile . " Which Gordon . " " I know a lot of Gordons , " I said . " Yes ? Very nice . I mean the Gordon of the Zechariah Frankel Seminary . You know that Gordon ? " " Abraham Gordon ? Yes . " " You know him well ? " " I know hini . " " How is it that you know him ? " " I know him , " I said again . " Yes. - You know him . That much is now clear . Malter , tell inc . You know Gordon has been put into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term .. for excommunication . I felt my fingers tighten on the Talmud I held in my hand . Yes , I knew aboutthatzI said . " You know that . You tell me you know that . Now I must ask vou , is it true that you were with Gordon in the Zechariah Frankel I , ibrary last month ? "  | I stared at him and heard myself tell him that I did n't know anyone who took that excommunication seriously . " You do not know anyone who takes it seriously . You do not ? " he broke off . " Tell me , Malter , you think placing someone in cherem is a light thing ? Have you read the books of Gordon ? " I lied . I told him I had never read any of Abraham Gordon 's hooks . " Gordon destroys Yiddishkeit with his books . The cherem is not a light thing . Sucha-rnan-is a danger . " He paused for a moment . I le had to tilt his head backward a little to look up at me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was white and starched . His tie was carefully knotted . He was still tugging at his beard , and I noticed for the first time that the third and fourth fingers of his right hand were faintly misshapen , as if they had been broken at one time and poorly reset . " Tell me , " he was saying . Danny 's father talks that way , I thought . Rav Gershenson talks that way . They all talk that way . Tell me . Tell me . " Tell me , Matter . What were you doing all those weeks in the Zechariah Frankel Seminary ? " I wondered where he was getting all his information about me . But it did not really matter . Anyone could have seen nee going in and out of there . The Zechariah Frankel Seminary was less than a half hour 's walk from Hirsch . Rav Kalman might even have seen me himself . It made no difference how he knew . As far as I was concerned , it even made no difference that he knew . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him I had been doing some work for my father . " What work ? " he asked . I told him I had been checking the footnotes and the variant readings in the galleys to my father 's book to save him time and spare him the physical effort of having to go back and forth to that library . He was very tired after more than a year of work on the book , I said . He was not a well man , I said . I had used the term variant readings . I saw his eyes open wide at that . " Your father has written a book ? " he asked . " Yes . "  | " I know of your father . Tell me , the book , your father 's book , what is it about ? It is a book on the Gemora ? " I told him it contained many of the scholarly articles my father had published over the years , as well as a lengthy introduction on the nature of the Talmud . The introduction had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little proudly . I omitted mentioning that the introduction also contained a long section on the methodology of Talmudic text criticism . He was silent for a moment . He tugged at his beard . Then he lit another cigarette . " It is forbidden to punish without first giving a warning , " he said , his voice abruptly cold . " So I give you a warning , That school is unclean . You are not to set foot in that school . " I stared at him , not quite believing what I had heard . I told him I had seen dozens of Orthodox Jews in that library , studying , doing research , writing . He became angry then . " Orthodox ! Everything is Orthodox ! What kind of Orthodox ? There is one Yiddishkeit . I know nothli ing about Orthodox . The school is unclean and its books arc unclean . My students will Mkt go into that school . " I said nothing . My face was suddenly hot . I felt the slow mounting of anger . " Malter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me simply because he knows Gemora . You understand that . " I did not say anything . " You understand , Malter ? I do not give smicha only for Gemora . I nodded or did something to indicate acknowledgment of his words . There was a brief silence . " When does your father 's book come out ? " he asked quietly . I told him . I Ic dismissed me with an abrupt wave of his hand and a curt nod of his head . pi k I went through the corridor and the marble lobby and out into the street . The afternoon air was cold and sharp . I stood there for a  | moment , breathing deeply . Then I realized I had forgotten my coat in the synagogue . I went back inside . Irving Goldberg sat in a chair near the coat racks that stood against the wall opposite the Ark . He had obviously been waiting for mc . He was short , round-faced , chubby , very solemn , and very good at Talmud . We studied together every morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read for today 's shiur . Ile got to his feet . He was wearing his coat and hat . I put on my coat . He watched me solemnly . I told him he had done a good job in the shiur . He shrugged . " What did he want ? " " A private musar message . " " How private ? " I did not respond . " Are you in trouble , Reuven ? " " I do n't know . " He looked uncomfortable . He stood there in his heavy coat , looking short and round and uncomfortable . " Reuven , " he said . I looked at him . He glanced around quickly . We were alone in our part of the synagogue . " Are you thinking of applying to the Frankel Semi-nary ? " That did it for me . " No , I 'm not thinking of applying to the Frankel Seminary , " I almost shouted . " What 's going on around here ? What 've we got , our own version of the Spanish Inquisi-tion ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake , not so loud . Are you crazy ? " " I 'm going , " I said . " There are rumors that you 're planning to apply to that seminary , " he said somewhat plaintively . " Do n't get angry at me , Reuven . " " What rumors ? Where have there been rumors ? I have n't heard any rumors . " There have been rumors for the past three weeks . "  | were only working on your father 's book , " he said , shaking his head . We passed Rav Gershenson 's classroom , which adjoined ours . It was a quarter after three , fifteen minutes past the end of the class hour . I peered through the small square window set in the door . Rav Gershenson was still there , standing behind his desk surrounded by more than half a dozen of his students . We came outside . The metal door slammed shut behind me . I went quickly down the stone steps to the sidewalk . The street was crowded with people and traffic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuffed his hands into the pockets of his coat . The coat lay tight around his heavyset round frame . Ile smiled solemnly . " You 'd really stand this place on its head if you ever went to that seminary , " he said . " Very funny , " I muttered . I was in no mood for his gloomy humor . " Star Talmud student at Hirsch goes to Frankel , " Irving Goldberg was saying . " That would be like what 's his name  --  your friend ? Danny Saunders  --  that would almost be like Danny Saunders going to that seminary . " He looked at me . " Were you really there only for your father 's book ? " he asked seriously . " No , I was there to take lessons in conversion to Catholicism . For God 's sake . How can something as small as this get blown up that way ? " . " 1 , ashon . Kara , " he said . " Gossip , gossip , gossip . Rumors . " I have n't heard a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People saw you going in and out of that place . They thought ? " " I was checking the galleys of my father 's  --  book , " I said . " Oh , " he said . " Oh . " " Yes . Oh . " " God , " he said . " You could kill a person with rumors. " 1 " I 'm going . I 've got a logic class in fifteen minutes . " " I 'll walk out with you . " We went out of the synagogue . " You  | Tongues . Life and death are in the power of the tongue , ' " he quoted in Hebrew . " I ' 11 see you tomorrow morning , " I said . Then I said , " Why did n't you tell me earlier about the rumors ? " I Ic smiled soberly . " I was afraid they might be true . " " I 'll see you tomorrow , " I said , and went off to my logic class . , ate that night I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without effort at a series of complicated problems in symbolic logic . I had turned down the covers of my bed and turned off the ceiling light . But I knew I would be unable to sleep , and so I sat at my desk in my pajamas with only the desk lamp on and filled pieces of paper with the conventional notations that form the language of logic . I must have sat there for hours ; the top of the desk became heaped with paper . There was comfort and satisfaction in the effortless manipulation of neutral symbols , and I worked at it steadily . The only sound in the room was the faint scratching of my pencil on the sheets of paper . It was after two in the morning when my father knocked quietly on my door . He stood in the doorway , wearing his dark-blue robe over his pajamas , his gray hair uncombed . " I saw your light , Reuven , " he said softly . " It is late . " I looked at him and did not say anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him I was n't doing assignments . I could n't sleep , I said . He came into the room and closed the door . " You were so quiet tonight , " he said . " Even Manya commented to me on how quiet you were tonight . " I put down the pencil . He came over to the bed and sat down , drawing the robe over his thin knees . He looked tired and frail and I felt something turn over inside me as I gazed at him , and I looked away . Quantifiers stared up at me from the piece of paper on my desk . I heard him sigh . " Little children little troubles , big children big troubles , " he murmured in Yiddish . " When my big Reuven is so  | quiet , there are big troubles . Can I be of help to you , Reuven ? " I told him it was n't anything I could n't handle by myself . He regarded me in silence for a moment through his steelrimmed spectacles , his eyes heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Reuven , " he said quietly . " I want only to help if I can . " " You 're not prying , abba . Since when do you pry ? " " With a grown son a father never knows when he is prying . Can I be of help to you , Reuven ? " he asked again . I had not wanted to tell him . I had not wanted him to know it had come about as a result of the weeks I had spent working on his book . Now I found I needed to tell him . I spoke with as much calm as I could bring to my words . He blinked wearily . He sighed . He rubbed a hand over the gray stubble of beard on his cheeks and shook his head . " I was right , " he said quietly . " It is a big problem . " " He 's a detestable human being . " " Detestable ? From a single conversation you conclude that a person is detestable ? " " I 'm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough about him to call him detestable ? I am surprised at you , Reuven . " " I know enough about him to know that I ca n't stand him as a teacher . He 's poisoned everything at Hirsch for me . " They 're poison , Michael had said . They 'll poison all of us with their crazy ideas . I felt cold and stared down at the sheets of paper on my desk . The symbols stared back up at me , silent . " I understand how you feel , Reuven . I understand what it means to have such a teacher . " He spoke very quietly , his eyes narrow with sudden remembering . He was quiet a long time . Then he said , speaking more to himself than to me , " A teacher can change a person 's life . A good teacher or a bad teacher . Each can change a person 's life . " He was silent again . Then he said , very softly , " But only if the person is ready to be changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am not saying it is impossible . Do not misunderstand me . I am saying it is rare . More often he can only occasion such a change . You understand what I am  | s lying . " He smiled faintly . " You are a student of philosophy and logic . I am certain you understand . " I was quiet . " Yes , " he said . " I am certain you understand . " He paused . " Reuven , was Rav Kalman angry when he spoke to you ? " " IIe 's always angry . " " I have been reading some of his articles . He also writes in anger . He attacked Abraham Gordon recently in an article . It was unpleasant to read . His choice of language was unpleasant . But he understands Abraham Gordon 's thinking . " " He wants me to obey the cherem . " " What cherem ? " " Against Professor Gordon . " " You did not tell me you talked about Abraham Gordon . " " He said I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to obey the cherem . " " The cherem is nonsense . " " He wants me to obey it . " My father was quiet . It is a bigger problem than I realized , " he said after a moment . " What energies we waste fighting one another . " He got slowly to his feet . " I am very tired , Reuven . I will not send you any more to the Frankel Library . The hook is done . There is no need for you to go there any more . Unless you want to go for yourself . I do not know what to tell you about Abraham Gordon . I can not think now . I am too tired . " He looked at me wearily . " Reuven , you want smicha from the Ilirsch Yeshiva ? " " Yes , " I said . " And Ray Kalman 's approval is mandatory in order for you to obtain smicha ? " " Yes . " " You are no longer curious about the philosophy of Abraham Gordon ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word I wanted , I thought . He sighed heavily . " I wish I knew what to tell you . I must go back to sleep . We will talk about it again another time . I do not  | know what to tell you now . Go to sleep yourself , Reuven . It is almost three o'clock . You will not be able to think in the morning . He went slowly from the room . I heard the soft shuffling of his slippers as he moved through the hall . Then I heard nothing . I sat at my desk and stared at the pieces of paper . I sat at my desk and the symbols stared back up at me , silent , inviting . I snapped off the lamp and went to bed and was awake a long time . The night wind blew against the window . In the apartment overhead a baby cried , then was silent . I fell asleep . There was the wind and the sun and the heaving waters of the lake and Michael and I on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make out the words but I knew he was angry . I woke . I lay awake , thinking of Michael . Then I slid slowly into exhausted sleep . The next day at the beginning of the shiur , Rav Kalman called on me to read . I was dull-headed with lack of sleep . Part of the time I did not even know what I was saying . Rav Kalman listened , asked questions , paced back and forth , smoked , tugged at his beard , asked more questions , and looked startled when I automatically and sleepily altered a word in the text that I instinctively sensed was wrong . He rushed to his desk , peered down at his Talmud , straightened , stared at me for a moment , then resumed his pacing . I realized then what I had done and glanced at the margin . The variant reading was listed ; it had been inserted by a medieval scholar , which meant that it was an authorized reading . I took a deep breath . All of this had taken a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the class session , reading slowly , explaining carefully . Rav Kalman paced and smoked . We had a brief skirmish over a passage in one of the major medieval comnicntaries . But I backed off quickly and went on reading . Rav Kalman said nothing to me when the class ended . Two days later , he called on me again . I read . He paced and smoked and asked questions . Again , he said nothing to me when the class ended .  | About half a dozen of my classmates followed me over to the coat racks inside the synagogue . " I Ic 's picking on you , " Irving Goldberg said mournfully . " Why n Ile picking on you ? " " Why do n't you ask him ? " I said . " You 're the best Gemora head in the class , " another student %aid . " He always picks on those he loves . " " ' This is n't something to joke about , " Irving Goldberg said . I put on my coat . They crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " You want a public announcement . Here 's a public announcement . I have not applied to the Frankel Seminary . There were embarrassed smiles . " They did n't believe me , " Irving Goldberg said somberly . " An unreliable witness , " a student said in Hebrew , using the ' Talmudic term . " You were really only working on your father 's book ? " another classmate said . I looked at them . They stared back at me . The overhead fluorescents were reflected in their glasses ; their faces seemed pale . " You are all practicing to become future Rav Kalmans , " I said . There were more embarrassed smiles . - " He 's got the whole school infected , " I said . Not the whole school , " someone said . " Do n't talk like that , Reuven , " someone else said . " He 's our Ray . " " I 'm tired , " I said . " I have n't slept much this week . And I 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next musar message . " I left them there , bought an afternoon paper in a candy store across the street , and caught a bus . Inside the bus I read the paper , dozed for a few minutes , then woke and looked out the window at the streets . Dense clouds covered the sky . I sat there and stared out the window at the gray streets and did not look at the clouds .  | I was tense and weary to the point of near exhaustion by the time Shabbat came that week . I almost fell asleep at the Shabbat meal on Friday night . I went to bed immediately after my father and I chanted the Grace and I tossed all night with ugly dreams but they slid steeply out of me and evaporated when I woke in the morning . I found myself heavy-lidded and nodding into sleep during the services , and later , after the meal , I went back to bed and slept and there were more dreams , and I woke late in the afternoon and felt my pillow cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father and I said very little to one another all through that Shabbat . Because Sunday Talmud classes at Hirsch ended at one in the afternoon , the period of preparation ran from nine to a few minutes before eleven , and the shiur ran from eleven to one . The next morning Rav Kalman called on me again . I saw my classmates exchange grim looks . I began to read . He let me read and explain for a long time . All the while he paced back and forth , smoking . Then he stopped me on a passage I had struggled with during the period of preparation and still did not clearly understand . I started to give him one of the commentaries on the passage . He stopped me again . " I did not ask you for the Maharsha , Malter . What do the words mean ? Explain the words . Can you explain the words ? " I tried to put the words together as best I could ; they did not hang together properly ; there was clearly something wrong with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rav Kalman said . " Make it clearer . It is not yet clear . " I explained it again . Then I was silent . He stood stiffly behind the desk . " You can not explain it better ? No . I see you can not . Can anyone explain it better ? " I lis question was answered with a stonelike silence . Ile ' put his cigarette into the ashtray . " American students , " I heard him mutter to himself . Then he launched into a loud and lengthy explanation of the passage . It was clever ; it was.s.ery clever .  | But it took no account of some of the grammatical difficulties in the text . " You understand now , Malter ? " I hesitated . " You understand ? " I nodded . " Yes ? Good . Now tell us what the Maharsha says . " And he paced back and forth as I went wearily through the explanation offered by the commentary . At supper that night I mentioned the passage to my father . " What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought the text was wrong . " And how would you correct it ? " I emended three of the words and rearranged a segment of the passage . His eyes shone and he smiled proudly . " Very good , Reuven . Very good . The passage has been written on extensively . " And he cited some articles in scholarly journals in which the passage had been discussed at great length . Two of the articles , he said , had emended the text in precisely the way I had suggested . And my father agreed that this probably had once been the correct text . At that point Manya , who had been standing patiently by the stove listening to us talk , told us in her broken English to cat , the food was getting cold . We ate . After supper , my father went into his study to grade examination papers and I sat in my room at my desk and worked on a paper I was doing for a symbolic logic course . It was a complicated paper on epistemological assumptions and primitives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the phone rang I looked at my watch and was surprised to discover it was almost eleven o'clock . The sound of the phone echoed shrilly in the hall of the apartment . I went out of my room , wondering who would be calling so late at night , and lifted the receiver . " Reuven ? " a voice said very faintly . " Yes . "  | " Rcuven Malter ? " " Yes . " " Ilcllo , Reuven . " " Ilcllo . I can barely hear you . Who is this ? " " Is this Reuven Malter ? " " Yes . I ca n't hear you . We must have a bad connection . " " No . The connection is all right . I ca n't talk loud . This is Michael . I 'm not allowed to phone without permission . " " Michael , " I heard myself say , and sank slowly into the chair next to the phone stand . I felt cold with shock . " Do you remember me , Reuven ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right ? " " I 'm surprised . I did n't expect  --  should you be calling if it 's not allowed ? " " I need to talk to you , Reuven . I hate to be sneaky , but I need to talk to you . Can I talk to you , Reuven ? " " Sure you can talk to me . " " You have to promise you wo n't tell anyone . I do n't want anyone to know I broke the rules . Will you promise ? " I did not say anything . I found I was pressing the phone hard against my ear in order to hear him better . The cartilage of my ear ached . I moved the phone away slightly . " Reuven ? " I heard him say . " Reuven ? " " Yes . " " You have to promise . " " All right . " " I do n't want anyone to think I 'm breaking the rules . Some of the people here are very nice . I do n't want them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael . " I heard a rustling , clicking sound in the phone . Then there was silence . But the connection did not seem dead . " Michael , " I said . " Michael . " Then louder , " Michael . " The silence of the phone was terrifying . I felt the skin prickle on my arms and on the back of my neck . ' Flu  --  n I heard a frantic whisper . " Someone is coming . Wait .  | Do n't hang up . " Then , again , silence . The door to my father 's study opened slowly . My father came into the hall . Ile stood in the hall , looking at me . The hand with which I was holding the receiver began to tremble . " There is news about Michael ? " my father asked softly . " I heard von mention Michael . " I put my other hand over the mouthpiece . " Michael is on the phone , " I said . " He 's calling from the treatment center . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you still there ? " My father stared at me . I took my hand away from the mouthpiece , " Yes . " " He 's gone . Whoever it was is gone . He did n't come in . " His straining , whispering voice sounded tremulous with relief . " I do n't want them to catch me . Reuven , are you all right ? Are you feeling all right ? " " Yes , I 'm all right . " " Why do n't you come to visit me ? You 've never once come to visit me . " I gripped the phone tightly and did not say anything . My father walked silently past the door to my room and stood between me and the framed pictures of I-Ierzl , Bialik , and Chaim Wcizmann that hung from the wall . " Reuven , " Michael said . " I 'm here , Michael . " " Do n't you want to visit me , Reuven ? " " I asked if I could visit you . They said only your family was allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who said you could n't visit ? " He was still whispering . But his voice had changed . It was hard , suspicious . I did not know what to do . I did not know whether it would upset him more if I continued talking to him and answered his questions or if I told him I could not talk to him at all because he did not have permission to call mc . I did not know how much I could tell him . I did not know whether I could tell him anything .  | Michael 's tighir whisper came clearly through the phone . " Who said that , ReuveO ? I felt it imposs ible to tell him we could not continue talking . So I told him Dann s supervisor had not wanted me to visit until the period of adjust lent was over . I did not know whether . I was saying the right ehrng or not . I did not know what else to tell him . I thought I heard a soft laugh and the muttered words " period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's a jerk . I ca n't stand him . Dr. Altman is a jerk . I 'm driving him crazy . I thought I 'd be talking td your friend . But they want me to talk to Dr. Altman . Reuven listen . Do you want to visit me ? " " Yes , " I heard myself say . " I thought yov1 did n't want to , so I did n't say anything . Now I 'll tell them I want to see you . They 'll let you come . Will you come , Reuven ? " " Sure . " " I 'll be glad t0 see you . I hate this place . Remember the times we went sailing I think of them a lot . I hate this place . " The words were tumbling out of him in angry , rushing whispers . " Some of the kids I go , to school with here are awful . We have school right here . I reai1Y want to see you , Reuven . I 'm going to scream my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His voice was considerably louder than a whisper now . He sounded deeply 9gitated . " Michael , tale it easy , " I said . " Calm clown . " " Remember the roller coaster ? " he said . " Remember the first time we went s piling ? " " Yes . " " Are you still seeing Rachel ? " he asked abruptly . I hesitated . " Reuven ? " " No , " I said . But we 're still friends . " " You 're not seeing her ? " The agitation was suddenly out of his voice . I Ic sounded strangely relieved . " No. " ' rime was a cause .  | " Reuven , " he said . " Listen . I want you to bring something when you come . " I did not say anything . My father stood very quietly , looking at Inc . " Promise me you 'll bring it , " Michael said . " Bring what ? " " There 's a newspaper I want you to find and bring me . Promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He told me . I held the phone and said nothing . " Reuven ? " " Let me think about it . " " Please . " " I want to think about it . " " It 's only a newspaper , Reuven . " His voice was suddenly angry . " For God ? " His voice broke off . Then I heard a barely audible whisper . " Please visit me , Reuven . Good-bye . " There was a click . The line went dead . I hung up the phone . The palms of my hands were icy with sweat . I looked at my father . " I 've got to talk to you , " I said quietly . He nodded and without a word walked quickly to his study . I followed . Michael 's whispered voice echoed inside my head . You have to promise you wo n't tell anyone . You have to promise . My father went around the desk and sat down in his chair . The desk was large , with dark polished wood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered almost its entire top . The blotter was piled high with papers . The room was dark , except for the goose-necked desk lamp , which cast a large , bright circle of light across the desk top and onto the gray-carpeted floor . My father sat behind the desk and regarded me intently . I told him about the conversation with Michael . He was quiet a very long time after I was done talking . His eyes were dark and he seemed deeply troubled . " That is the copy of the newspaper that contains Rav Kalman 's article , " he said .  | " Which article ? " " The attack on Abraham Gordon . " I did not say anything . " How did he find out about that article ? " my father murmured . " It was published two weeks ago . " I told him I did n't know . " I think you should call Danny , " my father said . " You can not undertake the responsibility of keeping this call a secret . You should call Danny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should call Danny . You must not conceal this from Danny . Michael is ill . You are not bound by a promise made under such a circumstance . " Michael 's frantic whispering was still in my ears . It was as if I were still listening to him over the phone . " Call Danny , " my father said . " Immediately . " " It 's after eleven o'clock , abba . " " I know what time it is , Reuven . Call Danny . " I got slowly to my feet . " Tell him everything , Reuven . You must not conceal anything . " I went out into the hall and picked up the phone and dialed Danny 's apartment . The phone rang a long time . There was no answer . I told my father Danny was not in . He said to try until I got him . I told him I could just as easily call Danny sometime tomorrow . No , I must call Danny tonight , he said . He seemed deeply disturbed and in no mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went back into my room , worked on my logic paper for a few minutes , and called Danny again . I waited a long time before I hung up the phone . Twenty minutes later , I called him again . There was no answer . i called him after my shower , waited a quarter of an hour , called him again , waited another quarter of an hour , and called him again . I wondered if he had decided to sleep over his father 's house that night and go to Columbia in the morning . But he had always hccn in his apartment on Sunday nights . He 's on another emergene . I thought .  | I decided to call the treatment center . It was listed in the Brooklyn phone book . I dialed quickly and got the night watchman . He did n't know anything about a Mr. Daniel Saunders . He would connect me with the staff member on night duty . " Hello , " a man 's voice said . I apologized for phoning so late at night and explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no emergency here tonight . Are you a friend of Dan 's ? " " Yes . My name is Reuven Malter . Do you have any idea where he might be ? " " No , I 'm sorry . What did you say your name was ? " I told him . " Well , " he said . " Is n't that something ? Do you know a boy named Michael Gordon ? " " Yes , " I said . " Is n't that something ? I just found him wandering around the halls here and sent him off to bed . He told me you were coming to visit him soon . Is n't that something ? " " Yes , " I said . " Thank you . " I hung up and sat there and stared at the phone . It seemed alive . I went into my room and worked on my logic paper . It was twenty minutes to one . My father came into my room and told me he was going to bed and that I should keep trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . I called Danny 's apartment again at ten minutes to one . The phone was picked up after the second ring . " Yes ? " It was Danny 's nasal voice . " Reuven , " I said , feeling a flood of relief . " What ? " " Reuven Malter . " " Reuven ? " There was a pause . Then , " What 's wrong ? " " Where have you been ? I 've been trying to get you for more than an hour . " " I just got back from ? " He stopped . " I just walked in the door . What 's wrong ? " he said , his voice very tight .  | " Michael called me tonight . " There was silence . " Danny ? " " Yes , " he said quietly . " I heard you . Michael called you tonight . Just a minute . Let me get my coat off . " I heard the phone scrape against s , or , iething . Then , " Go ahead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone call . He listened without interrupting me . Then he was quiet for a while . " You did right to call me , " he said . " You can thank my father . " " We have to talk . " " Go ahead , " I said . " Not now . Not over the phone . I want to see you . " " When ? " " Tomorrow . Tomorrow night . " " Tomorrow night is fine . " " What time should I come over ? " I thought for a moment . " I 'll come over to you . At eight . I want to see if you 're really opening your window these days . " Then I said , " How isMichael ? " " Michael is not good , " Danny said quietly after a moment . " I 'll see you tomorrow night at eight o'clock , " I said , and hung up the phone . My father was standing by his bedroom door , wearing his pajamas . He nodded soberly when I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went into his room . The next day Rav Kalman called on inc again . I read and explained , and he paced and listened . Occasionally he interrupted and asked me to clarify something I had said or a passage I had gone through too quickly . We fought for more than ten minutes over a difficult passage . I did not back off this time . Instead , I fought very hard , using passages from other tractates to buttress my argument and raising my voice to counter his words . I was  | talking loudly and excitedly and he let me go on unopposed for a moment and I saw him close his eyes and incline his head in my direction . He listened to me , his eyes closed . Then he opened his eves and broke into my words . From now on I would sit in the front row , he said . I would sit between Schwartz and Steinberg in the front row , and I would not have to shout to make myself heard . He spoke without sarcasm , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go directly to the coat racks after class . I went up to the third floor where there was a Judaica library which I rarely used ; most of the books I needed for Talmud I could find in the synagogue bookcases ; the others I either owned or borrowed from my father . It was a small library , the size of two classrooms , poorly lighted and musty with the odor of old bindings and yellowing pages . Its windows were rarely open , its walls needed paint , and its four reading tables were old and scarred . To my knowledge , it contained not a single work of modern , scientific Jewish scholarship . The librarian was a short , wrinkled old man with a white beard , a dark skullcap , and nearsighted eyes behind thick glasses . I asked him if the library kept back copies of  --  and I named a newspaper . No , the library did not have that newspaper , he said . But he had his own copies of that newspaper around somewhere . Which issue did I want ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner of the library and looked through a mountainous disarray of books and papers . He found it and brought it over to me . IIe had meant to throw it out , he said . Yes , I could have it . I thanked him and stuffed it into a pocket . Then I went over to the catalogue . The file cards on Rav Kalman were almost an eighth of an inch thick . I flipped through them quickly . All of the books listed had been published before the war , some in Warsaw , most in Vilna . With only one exception , they dealt with matters of Jewish law . The exception was a book on ethics . I made out call slips for the work on ethics and three of the books on Jewish law which I selected at random . Fifteen minutes later I came out of the building with the four books in my hands . They were old , dusty books , with cracked  | bindings that crumbled at the edges . I was five minutes late for my logic class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before to want to read any of his writings . Nor had he ever mentioned any of his writings to us in class . That night on the subway ride over to Danny 's apartment I read his book on ethics .  | It was cold and dark and an icy wind blew along Broadway and up through the narrow side street where Danny lived , a fierce wind that came off the river , which I could not see for the darkness . The house was small , three stories , red brick , and old , very old . Five worn stone stairs , a badly fitting wooden front door , a tiny overheated foyer with mailboxes , buttons , and nameplates . I pressed the button over the name Saunders . There was a loud answering buzz . I pushed open the heavy inner door and started up the steep , carpeted , narrow staircase . The door closed with a loud click . It was a little before eight o'clock . Someone inside the house was frying bacon . The staircase was poorly lighted ; the carpet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third floor . Danny was waiting for me in his doorway . He had on a dark woolen sweater and dark trousers . There was a skullcap on his head . His face was pale and he blinked at me wearily from behind his black shell-rimmed glasses . I took off my coat and hat . Danny put them into a closet . I put on my skullcap . " Well , " I said . " How are you ? " " I 'm all right . " " What have you got that I can thaw out with ? " " Coffee . " " Kosher coffee ? " He smiled . " It 's good to see you , " I said . " Yes , " he said quietly . =The place is different . You 've entered the twentieth century . " He did not say anything . He went over to his tiny kitchen and started preparing the coffee .  | " I did n't know you liked abstract art , " I said . " I 'm learning . " His back was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very nice . New linoleum . Fresh paint . Very neat . And clean . It 's a nice apartment when you keep it clean . And the window is open . Very nice . How did you like Barefoot in Athens ? " I asked , looking at the handbill near the typewriter on the desk . He turned then and followed my eyes to the handbill . " I liked it , " he said , very quietly . " I take cream and two sugars , " I said . He looked at me , then turned slowly away . I heard gas jets come to life with a tiny puff of sound . I went over to the bookcase . It was the old bookcase I had seen in the apartment in the spring . Alongside it stood a new fourdrawer gray filing cabinet . On the other side of the filing cabinet was a new bookcase . There were no books on the floor . The bookcases were filled with technical books and journals , all of them neatly arranged on the shelves . The new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's about Socrates , is n't it ? Barefoot in Athens . " I had gone over to his desk , which was covered with papers and books , and was looking at the handbill again . " Yes , " I heard Danny say as if from a very long distance away . " Which Byrd is this ? Admiral Byrd ? " A book on his desk had caught my eye . I thought I saw his shoulders stiffen . IIe spooned sugar into the cups . " Yes . Admiral Byrd . " " The explorer ? " The book was titled Alone . " Yes , " he said . I picked up the book , then noticed the titles of the two books on which it had been placed . One was A Philosophy of Solitude by John Cooper Powys ; the other was a fat little book of the sort published in the last century . It was called Solitude . The author 's name was given as Zimmerman . I put the Byrd book back down on the desk and stood there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up and crossed over to the sofa bed and sat down . It was soft and  | comfortable . I leaned back against the wall and looked at Danny , who was still standing in front of the sink , his back to me . " I low are you , Danny ? How are you really ? " ? Fired . " " You 're always tired . Whenever I see you you 're tired . " " It 's the occupational disease of graduate school . " " How is your father ? " " My father is all right . " " How is Rachel ? " " Rachel is  --  fine . " " The water is boiling . " He turned off the flames , filled the cups , brought me one , and took the other with him over to the desk . He sat down on the chair in front of the desk and did not look at me . " It 's all right , " I said quietly . He looked at me then and blinked his eyes . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . It 's not all right . " " There was nothing there . We were good friends . We still are friends , -I think . Rut there was nothing there , Danny . " " It 's wrong . There is n't a thing that 's right about it . " I sipped at my coffee . It was very hot . " How does a Hasid go out on a. , elate with a girl ? " I asked . Danny said nothing . " We never talked about that . " He looked away . " There are some things you do n't talk about . " " There 's nothing people do n't talk about these days . " " There are some things I do n't talk about . " " Danny . " He looked at me . " How long is it now ? " " Since November . " " Is it really serious ? " " Yes . " " Very serious ? " " Yes .

It 's all wrong . " " You mean it 's wrong professionally . Is that what you mean ? " " Yes . " I drank some more coffee . It was not so hot now as before . " You have no idea what a mess this can become . " " No , " I said . " I have no idea about that at all . " He drank some coffee and put the cup down on the desk next to the typewriter . The desk lamp shown on his face , bathing it in light and shadows . I saw him blink his eyes . " You 're making better coffee these days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're learning about a lot of things . " " Yes , " he said . " It 's called motivation . That 's what it 's called , is n't it ?

There was nothing there . " " All right . " " Tell me about Michael . " He picked up his cup , sipped some coffee , and put it back down on the desk . " Michael is very sick , " he said . " Tkanks . Nowtell me something about Michael I do n't already know . " " You 're angry , " he said . " I ca n't talk to you when you 're angry . " I said nothing .

" " IIe 's not driving him crazy . Professor Altman does n't get driven crazy by his patients . He 's a great therapist . But Michael is n't cooperating . " " What does he do ? " " He does n't do anything . He comes into a therapy session and just sits there . Or he spouts dreams and fantasies that are absolute lies . He wo n't cooperate at all . " " Are you taking over the therapy ? " " Under very close supervision . " " Is n't that unusual ? " " Yes . " " They have recognized your genius . " " They 're willing to try almost anything now . It 's very serious with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " There have been fist fights . Between Michael and some of the other boys . He hates to be called only by his last name . Some of the boys have latched on to that . He hates to be called Gordon . " " Fist fights , " I said . I could not imagine Michael in a fist fight . " He kicked a boy in the groin . During a lunch hour . He pushed him out of the chair and kicked him . " " God , " I said . " He has sex fantasies about Rachel . " I stared . " Those are the only fantasies he 's told us about that we think are real . " " God , " I said again . " Rachel . " " His father gave him a small Tanach . " " ' I'anach " is the acronym for the Hebrew Bible . " He got hold of some matches a few days  | ago and burned it in the bathroom . One of the child-care people smelled the smoke . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did not say anything . " Three days ago , Shabbos afternoon , he disappeared from the grounds . A child-care worker found him four blocks away , shouting obscenities at people coming out of a funeral parlor . You know what that does to the treatment center in terms of its relationship to the community ? They 're uneasy with us around to begin with . He 's a very sick boy , your Michael . And we have n't the least notion of what it is that 's bothering him . " " He does n't like very Orthodox Jews . I know that bothers him . " " That 's not what is really bothering him . " " The symptom , not the disease . " " Very good , " he said . " Go to the head of the class . " " I remember something at least from your days with Freud . " " Those were different days , " he said . " Why different ? " " It 's always easier to learn something than to use what you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're alone when you 're learning . But you always use it on other people . It 's different when there are other people involved . " I was quiet . " You do n't want to make mistakes with people . Sometimes when you make a mistake you lose a human soul . " He used the Hebrew word " neshamah " for the soul , giving it his Ashkenazic pronunciation , " neshomeh , " and accenting the " sho . " I did not say anything for a long time . The noise of the radiator seemed suddenly very loud . I felt the wall cold against the back of my neck and moved forward slightly on the sofa bed . Danny finished his coffee . " What if you ca n't get through to him ? " I asked . He shrugged and said nothing . " How much time do you have ? " " A month . Two months . It depends on whether there 's any kind of progress . "  | " What if there 's no progress ? " Ile did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress , Danny ? " I lc glanced down at his desk and said nothing . Will he have to be institutionalized ? " I said . le did not say anything . " My God , " I said . " My God . " We were silent . The shade scraped against the sill . Danny sat staring down at his desk . " I could use another cup of coffee , " I said . Danny got to his feet and brought the cup over to the sink . " Is it really all right for me to see him ? " " Yes . " " Do his parents know you 'll be working with him ? " " Of course they know . " " The son of Reb Saunders working with the son of Abraham Gordon . " He came back with the coffee and went over to the desk and sat down . " I 'm working with a human being , " he said . " Should I let him see that article by Rav Kalman ? He wants me to bring it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgusting article . " " I read it . " " It 's disgusting . " " The language is in bad taste . " " It 's disgusting , " I said . " All right . " " You really want me to show it to him ? " " Yes . " I drank some coffee . " All because of a stupid carnival . " He looked at me . " Michael was sick long before that carnival . Crooks at carnivals do n't make people sick . You have to be sick already to be affected that way . " " We had a beautiful time on that lake . Ile likes to read clouds . Did I tell you about that ? He reads clouds . "  | " You told me . " I finished the coffee . " The summer seems very far away . " He was quiet . " It is far away , " I said . I put the empty coffee cup on the floor and leaned back against the wall and closed my eyes . I found I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds of traffic and the vibrating hum of an aircraft . There was the lake again and Michael 's thin body near the center board of the Sailfish and the gusting wind and clouds scudding smoothly across the blue sky . I sat there and thought about Michael . I could not stop thinking about Michael . Danny was talking to me . I opened my eyes and saw him talking to me but I could not hear the words . There was the wind on the lake moving against the Sailfish and Danny talking to me . I listened to him talking to me . IIe was asking about Rav Kalman . I told him about Rav Kalman . The hack of my neck was against the wall . I felt the wall vibrating as the aircraft passed overhead . I told him about Rav Kalman , and saw Michael standing up in the roller coaster , his face to the wind , and pulling up on the center board of the Sailfish , the muscles bulging in his long thin arms , and it seemed the sofa bed moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said .

There was a rebellion . Have you heard about the rebellion ? " " What rebellion ? Against Finkel ? " " In 1905 . A rebellion of the students in the Slobodka Yeshiva . Ile mentions it in the introduction to the book . They wanted more freedom . They wanted the right to read secular books and periodicals and newspapers .

There was the cove and the lairds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sky and the whisper of the wind through the trees , a loud whisper that was a roller coaster roar , and the sensation of dropping into the night . " We are at war , friend . Did n't you know we are at war ? " Danny said nothing . " The enemy surrounds us . The evil forces of secularism are everywhere . Look under the bed before you say the Kriat Shma at night . Look under the bed before you pray the Shacharit Service in the morning . And while you 're at it check the books on your desk and look in your typewriter and close the window because they come in with the wind . Did you know they come in with the wind ?

I read a long and fairly uncomplicated passage and he let nee go on without interruption . I took a little too much time explaining one of the medieval commentaries and he told me to read on , the commentary was simple . I read on and continued explaining . At one point he stood near the window , his head inclined toward me , listening . We came to a difficult passage and I explained it . He stopped me . " Explain it again , Malter . " I explained it again . " Say again what the words mean , Malter . " I said it again . " That is how you explain it ? " I told him that was how most of the commentaries explained it . He paced back and forth . " Read on , Malter . " I was in a nervous sweat by the time the shiur came to an end and got pitying glances from my classmates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not call on me the following day . He called on someone else . I sat directly in front of his dark-wood desk and listened to the rain on the windows and the traffic on the wet asphalt street outside and the tense voice of the student who was reading . The student sat three seats away to my right , thin-shouldered , palefaced , bent over his open Talmud , his voice faintly quavering . He had been reading for the past twenty minutes . A moment after he had begun to read it had become painfully obvious that he had come into the shiur unprepared . I had expected Rav Kalman to call on me again . He had entered the class promptly at one o'clock , walking very quickly , short , intense , immaculately dressed as always , starched white shirt , dark tie carefully knotted , trousers pressed . He had arranged his books on the desk , one piled neatly on top of the other , and had opened his Talmud and lit a cigarette , and had stood behind the desk .  | %looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long dark ! ward . We all knew that the thing to do then was stare back at loin whenever his eyes met yours because if you looked away it meant you had something to hide , you were unprepared , and you would be called on to read . I had felt his dark eyes on my face a long time and had not looked away . The student three seats to my tight had looked away immediately . Now he was reading . Rav Kalman smoked and paced and hurled questions . It had been an ugly twenty minutes so far . Also what ? " Rav Kalman asked . " What does also ' mean ? " The student struggled for an answer . Rav Kalman moved in front of him . His voice was thick with wnrasm . " That is what it means ? How can that be what it means ? Sa again , Greenfield , what does also ' mean ? " Abc Greenfield finally managed to blurt out the answer . He was ? fairly good Talmud student but it was obvious he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was pale and his eyes were frighttoed and filled with shame . He kept his eyes on the text and continued to read . A moment later , Rav Kalman stopped him again . " Included with what ? " he asked sharply . " What is Resh Lakish saying ? " Abe Greenfield stared down at his Talmud . " Included with what ? " Rav Kalman persisted . I could see Abe Greenfield frantically scanning the commentary of Rashi . " Now you study Rashi ? " Rav Kalman said . " Now ? In class you %h-dv Rashi ? " Abc Greenfield stared down at his Talmud . " I ) id you prepare the Gemora , Greenfield ? " Abc Greenfield shook his head . He sat there , drenched in mist . ' , and stared down at the Talmud and shook his head . No , at least you are not prepared . If you had prepared and did not know I would wonder what you are doing in my class . " He paused . " ' Fell me , Greenfield , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had time to prepare , Abe Greenfield said in a very small voice .  | I looked at him . Everyone looked at him . Rav Kalman tugged at his beard . " You did not have time ? What do you mean , you did not have time ? " Abe Greenfield stared down at his open Talmud and said nothing . I looked at him pityingly . He had said the one thing we all knew never to say to Rav Kalman , or to any Talmud teacher , for that matter . " There is sickness in your family ? " Rav Kalman was saying . " You were not well ? " " No . " " What do you mean , you did not have time ? " There was a math exam in his graduate-school class that afternoon , Abe Greenfield said . A very important exam . He had needed all his time to study for it . He spoke in English in a low , tremulous voice . Rav Kalman slowly put out his cigarette in the ashtray on the desk . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talmud . He gazed at Abe Greenfield . " You have a mathematics examination , " he said , his voice very cold . " You came unprepared to the shiur because of a mathematics examination ? " " It 's a final , " Abe Greenfield said . He was looking at Rav Kalman now . His face was pale but his lips had drawn tight . I looked around quickly . Everyone was staring at him . Abe Greenfield was the quietest student in the class . He had sat in that same seat for almost a year and a half now and had not said a word , except when called on to read . He was something of a genius at math . He had received a fellowship to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology but had decided to do his graduate work at Hirsch and go on for smicha at the same time . He had wide glasses and large eyes and a somewhat pimply face . He was shy , withdrawn . He came and went in silence . He never spoke unless spoken to first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile on his thin lips and without gazing directly at the person to whom he spoke . Now he was staring at Rav Kalman . " This is the first time I 'm unprepared , " he said . " The first time ? " Rav Kalman said .  | " Yes . " " I could understand if you were sick . " " 1 was n't sick . " " For mathematics you take time from the study of Torah ? " Abe Greenfield said nothing . He scratched at the side of his face 4iic1 sat there , staring back at Rav Kalman and saying nothing . " I low does one do such a thing ? " Abe Greenfield said nothing . " flow does one dare do such a thing ? " I saw Abe Greenfield sit up very straight in his seat then . His eves seemed to bulge slightly behind his glasses . Still he said nothing . " You made a choice , yes ? " Rav Kalman said coldly . " You had for yourself a choice between the Gemora and mathematics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand what it is to make a choice , Greenfield ? A choice tells the world what is most important to a human being . When a man has a choice to make he chooses what is most important to him , and that choice tells the worldwhat kind of a man he is . You understand me , Greenfield ? " Greenfield said nothing . I watched his hands . They were clenching and unclenching on top of the Talmud . There was a fixed , empty smile on his face now . " So , Greenfield , you have told us what is most important to you . 13ctween Gemora and mathematics , you chose mathematics . " Abe Greenfield said nothing . The room was deathly still . " It is important to choose , " Rav Kalman was saying . " A man must be forced to choose . It is only when you are forced to choose that you know what is important to you . It is very clear , Greenfield , that the Gemora is not as important to you as mathematics . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's a final exam , " he said . " It 's the only time I 've ever come unprepared . " I Iis face was tight but his voice came out whining . " You made a choice , " Rav Kalman said . " Yes ? You made a choice . " Abe Greenfield squirmed on his scat . Rav Kalman came right up to Abc Greenfield 's desk and peered  | down at him . I wished he would leave him alone . He had made his point . Why could n't he leave him alone now ? Leave him alone , I thought . Ca n't you see how miserable he feels ? " Tell me something , Greenfield . You are trying to get a doctorate in mathematics ? " He pronounced it " duk-tu-rot , " with a hard " r . " And he said it derisively . " I 'm trying , " Abe Greenfield said in a tremulous voice . " And how much time does it take to get a dukturot ? " " Years . " " Years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how much time do you take from the study of Torah ? " Abe Greenfield said nothing . Leave him alone , I thought . For God 's sake , leave him alone . Of all the people to pick on . " How much time do you take , Greenfield ? " Still Abe Greenfield said nothing . But a flush was rising on his face . " You have no tongue ? What happened to your tongue ? " There was a cruel relentlessness to him , and found myself beginning to be angry . Choices . IIe had written about forcing people to make choices . I had read that in his book on ethics two nights ago during the subway ride over to Danny : " A man must sometimes be forced to make choices , for it is only by his choices that we know what a man truly is . " " I-Iow much time do you take , Greenfield ? " " What do you want from me ? " Abe Greenfield said quietly . , " What do I want from you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why is that so terrible ? " " You have made a choice . " " I do n't know what you 're talking about . I made a choice . Once I did n't come prepared . Once . In a year and a half , I did n't come prepared once . " His voice was rising . " What do you want from me ? You 're shaming me in public . You 're shaming me in front of the whole class . What do you want from me ? " Rav Kalman gazed down at Abe Greenfield . He seemed surprised .  | " It 's wrong to shame someone in front of others . Why do you . hauiic me like this ? " His voice was quite high now , not loud , but high , straining . " You 're making an example of me . You 're using me . I 'm not a child . We 're not children . This is n't a European ghetto . You ca n't use me like that . You should apologize . You committed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apologize . " Rav Kalman stared at him . " Apologize , " Abe Greenfield said . " Enough ! " Rav Kalman shouted . " This is how you talk to your teacher ? " " You . wo n't apologize ? " " Enough ! " " You wo n't apologize ? " Rav Kalman stared at him out of dark , narrow eyes and seemed linable to respond . His face was quite pale around the black heard . I lc put a finger to the knot of his tic , then went quickly to his desk and lit a cigarette . He held the cigarette in his fingers . His hands were shaking . " You wo n't apologize ? " Abe Greenfield said , his voice still rising . His eyes were wide and he was sitting on his seat , staring straight at Rav Kalman . Then he got slowly . to.his.feet . " Stop picking on me , " he said , his voice suddenly very low . Rav Kalman stared at him . There was a stir from the class . " Stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there among the front row of seats and looking fixedly at Rav Kalman . " Stop picking on people , " he repeated . " What.does he say ? " Rav Kalman asked , looking at the class . He ( lid not understand the English expression to pick on someone . " Pick on someone else . Pick on the goyim , " Abe Greenfield said . He looked as though he no longer knew what he was saying . " Respect , " someone said loudly behind me in Yiddish . " Sit down , " someone else said . " Leave us alone , " Abc Greenfield said . " Scream at the goyim . " " How do you talk this way ? " Rav Kalman said , trembling . " How do you talk this wav ? How do you talk this way ? " Abe  | Greenfield was imitating Rav Kalman in Yiddish . Then he went back to English . " I should have gone to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . But my father wanted me to get smicha . " There was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greenfield , " Rav Kalman said . His voice shook . He seemed a little frightened . He touched the knot of his tie again and put the cigarette out in the ashtray with quick , nervous jabs . There were ashes on the desk . He ignored them . He seemed not to know what to do with Abe Greenfield . " Sit down , " someone in the class said again . But he stood there , tense and taut and a little wild-looking . " You wasted ten minutes just now . You wasted hours all this year and last year . That 's taking time from the study of Torah . " There was a loud stirring from the class . The student sitting to the right of Abe Greenfield tugged at his sleeve to get him to sit down . He shook off his hand . " Shah ! " Rav Kalman shouted at the class . He turned to Abe Greenfield . " Sit down , " he said quietly . Ibis voice was strangely soft . " Sit down , " he said again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Abe Greenfield stared at him . I saw him blink his eyes . He seemed to come suddenly awake . He looked quickly around the room and became aware that he was the only one standing . He stared at the eyes that were staring at him . A look of enormous astonishment came over his thin face . Slowly , he sank into his seat and looked down at his open Talmud . I could see his hands trembling . Then , with an abrupt movement of his right hand , he closed his Talmud . He got to his feet and picked up the Talmud . His eyes were wet . He went through the room , stiffly and with dignity . The door closed quietly behind him . There was a long moment of frozen silence . The rain fell loudly against the windows . Bedford Avenue looked drained of color , its asphalt glistening darkly in the heavy rain . Rav Kalman pointed a finger at mc . " Maker , go outside and see if he is all right . " I got quickly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  | " Halter . " I turned . " Bring him back inside if he is all right . Tell him I asked that he mile inside . " I went out into the corridor . He was not there . I went quickly tluuugh the marble entrance hall and pushed open the metal front doors and put my head outside . I felt the cold rain on my face . He was not anywhere in sight . I went back along the corridor and into the synagogue . I found him in the synagogue at one of the long tables near the coat racks . The synagogue was empty . Everyone was in class . We were the only ones there . He sat at the table and stared at the wall beyond the coat racks . He held his head in his hands and stared at the wall . I sat down next to him . " I low do you feel ? " Ile looked at me . " Arc you all right ? " I Ic looked at me and did not seem to see me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were all right . " Ile blinked . His pimply face was sallow . He looked a pathetic figure and seemed on the verge of tears . " What did I do ? " he said . " I just killed myself . " " Do n't he silly . " " I did n't know what I was saying . My God , what did I do ? My father will have a heart attack when he finds out . " " He does n't have to find out . " " The whole world will know . How can he not find out ? What did I do ? It was like a dybbuk suddenly got into me . What did I do ? " He was a graduate student in mathematics and he was talking about a dybbuk . " Do you want some water ? " " Wjiydid I- do that ? I do n't understand why I did that . Something broke inside me . I could feel it break . It was a dybbuk . A dvbbuk came inside me . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How can I go home ? My God , what happened to me ? "  | " Nothing happened to you . You lost your temper . Calm down . You 'll be a wreck for your math exam if you do n't calm down . " He looked at me . " The math exam , " I said . " You do n't want to mess up your math exam . " " That 's right , " he muttered . " You 're right . " " Okay , " I said . He took out his handkerchief , wiped his eyes and blew his nose , and put the handkerchief away . " You feel better now ? " " Yeah . " " Then let 's go hack in . " He looked at me , startled . " Rav Kalman asked me to bring you back inside . " " Are you crazy ? I ca n't go back in there . " " Yes you can , " I said . " I ca n't go in there . What can I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shiur . " " Leave me alone . I ca n't go . " " Cone on , " I said . I took his arm . " Leave me alone . " " All right , " I said . " Arc you through with Hirsch ? Finished ? All through ? Because you lost your temper once ? Because if you do n't go back in you are through . " He stared at me miserably . " Come on , " I said . " He 'll cripple me if I go back in there . " " he 'll cripple you if you do n't . " He got slowly to his feet . " You 'll sit and you 'll listen and you 'll tell your dybbuk to stay the hell away . All right ? " He stared at me and did not say anything . " Come on , " I said quietly . Ile walked alongside me , carrying his Talmud . We came together into the class . I saw heads turn . Rav Kalman was explaining a passage . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat  | and opened his Talmud . Rav Kalman went on explaining . I took my scat . Everyone 's eyes went back to Rav Kalman . He did not once look at Abe Greenfield . Someone else was reading now , a mdcnt in the back row . He read and answered questions . I forced myself back into the passages of Talmud . I sat there and listened and remembered Rav Kalman talking about choices and fought to keep my mind on the Talmud . A quarter of an hour before the end of the shiur he called on me to read a difficult three-line passage . I le was asking me for the third time to explain the words when the hell rang . He dismissed us . Abe Greenfield remained behind as the class quickly emptied . half a dozen of us waited near the coat rack for almost twenty minutes until he came back into the synagogue . There was a grim look on his face . " Well , he did n't cripple you , " I said . Ile reached for his coat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apologized . " " For twenty minutes ? " " He gave me a musar message . " " Are you still in the class ? " someone else asked . Ile nodded gloomily . " What did you do that for ? You were crazy to do that . " Abe Greenfield put on his coat and hat . " I got a math exam , " he said . " I got to go . " " What did you do that for ? Why did n't you say you were sick ? " " I do n't lie , " Abe Greenfield said with dignity . " What was the musar message ? " I asked . " Respect for teachers . And to make choices for Torah . " " That 's all ? " " Yeah . He was very nice about it . " " Nice ? " someone said . " Nice ? " " I got to go , " Abe Greenfield said . We watched him walk from the synagogue . " What a jerk , " the one next to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't talk like that , " Irving Goldberg said . He had been standing there all the time , silent and solemn . " He 's a jerk . " " That 's dirty talk , " Irving Goldberg said , using the Talmudic term " nibul peh . " " Iie 's still a jerk . " " Rav Kalman was nice , " someone else said . " Did you hear , Reuven ? Rav Kalman was nice . " " I heard . " " He was n't thrown out of the class , so Rav Kalman was nice . " " Maybe the Messiah has come , " another student said . " Maybe we ought to look out the window . Does it say anywhere the Messiah will come when it rains ? " I was suddenly weary of their talk . I put on my coat and hat . I wanted to get away from there . I wanted to sit in my logic class and forget Rav Kalman . I went quickly from the synagogue . Passing Rav Gershenson 's classroom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was sitting behind his desk and as usual about half a dozen students were standing intimately around him . I could hear his gentle voice through the door . Outside I felt the cold winter rain on my face and raised the collar of my coat . The asphalt street was black and glistening . There were puddles on the sidewalk . A bus went by close to the curb and sprayed water onto my shoes . I turned into the adjoining brownstone and started up the stairs to my logic class . I was ten minutes late . I sat near the window and listened to the rain and stared at the blackboard , which was being rapidly covered with symbols by my logic professor , a tall , dignified-looking man in his forties . He had a brown mustache and wore a tweed suit , and he spoke softly as he wrote on the board . I listened to him talk and copied symbols into my notebook and thought of Rav Kalman . I was sick of Rav Kalman , sick of being picked on , sick of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern European ghetto atmosphere of his class , sick- Of his fanatic zeal for Torah . Ihad about , four months left until the smicha examinations . That was a long tiine.  | I would control myself and be very careful . I would take the craniinations and be done with him . But I would have to be very careful in class . I sat there and thought a while longer of Rav Kalman , and then began to forget Rav Kalman because an interesttug problem in logic was being put on the blackboard , and soon I had forgotten completely about Rav Kalman and was lost in the convolutions of set theory . ' I'lccre was a message for me on the telephone stand in the hall when I got home that evening . Danny had called a few minutes earlier and wanted me to call him back at the apartment . The message was in my father 's handwriting . I could hear his typewriter going in the study . He had begun working on another article . I put away my hat and coat and dialed Danny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first ring . Danny had arranged for me to visit Michael next Sunday at three o'clock . Was that okay ? It was okay , I said . " How is he ? " I asked . " You 'll see for yourself . " " Are you working with him ? " " Yes . " " Well ? " " I do n't know . " " What do you mean , you do n't know ? " " I 've only had him once . " " How was it ? " " He talked about you the whole hour . " " Are you seeing him again ? " " Tomorrow . " " Will you he there on Sunday ? " " No . Look , I 've got to run . I 've got a seminar in half an hour . " I hung up the phone and stood there a long time , staring clown at it . Manya called us in to supper . I washed my hands and sat down at the kitchen table . My father was lost in thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not hungry . But I ate . With Manya inside that kitchen I always ate , whether I was hungry or not .  | The next day Rav Kalman came into the classroom , arranged his books neatly on the desk , lit a cigarette , peered intently at our faces , and called on Abe Greenfield . There was a jubilant quality in Abe Greenfield 's voice . He had expected to be called on and had come superbly prepared . He read excitedly for three quarters of an hour , showing off what he knew , and Rav Kalman paced and smoked and did not interrupt . Then he came up to Abe Greenfield 's desk and stopped him . " Very good , Greenfield . You came prepared and you know the Gemora . Very good . " Abe Greenfield 's face shone with joy . " Tell me , Greenfield . How did you do in your mathematics examination ? " Abe Greenfield 's face darkened a little . " Okay , " he said , guardedly . Rav Kalman tugged at his beard and nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great mathematician . But he never came to class unprepared . In America students come unprepared because of mathematics . He died in Maidanek . The student . They killed all my students in Maidanek . But he was the best . " He stood stiffly in front of Abe Greenfield 's desk and looked out at the class .. " I do not expect that American students will be like my students in Europe . But I expect that everyone will come to the shiur prepared . If there is a choice , I expect everyone to choose the Gemora . I received my smicha from one of the greatest scholars and saints in Europe . It is not only my name I will place on your smicha . My name carries the name of my teacher , Rav Zvi Hirsch Finkel , of blessed memory , and the name of his teacher  --  all through the generations of great teachers who handed down the smicha . Do you understand ? If you must make a choice , make it for Torah . I can not give you my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at Abe Greenfield . " You were angry at me yesterday , Greenfield . I made you angry , yes ? You lost your  | Iruiper at me and I accepted your apology . Now I must apologize for sham ing you before the class . A teacher has a right to be angry at a student if he does not come prepared . Your mathematics p-ofessor would also be angry at you if you came unprepared . But I went too far with you , Greenfield . I apologize . " I'hc class sat very still . I saw dust motes dancing in the rays of unilight that came through the windows . Abe Greenfield 's mouth had dropped open . A lot of mouths had dropped open . " I did not want you to be so angry , Greenfield . I wanted you to understand what it means to make a choice for Torah . You understand now , yes ? All right . Enough . We have spent enough time away from the study of Torah . " He looked at nee . " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You are always prepared . You study philosophy but you arc always prepared . " He looked straight at me . " Schwartz , read t he Gemora . " Stanley Schwartz , the tall heavy-set student who sat to my left , looked startled for a moment . Then he bent over his Talmud and commenced reading . IIalf an hour later , Rav Kalman called on me to read . It was another difficult passage and I gave him all the major commentaries on it and sat there , listening to him ask me for the fourth time to explain the words again . I took a deep breath and told him I could n't explain it any better than the commentaries and that I did n't understand what was being gained by going over and over the same passage . I said it quietly and respectfully , though my voice quavered a little as the words came out . Rav Kalman gave me a sharp look and for a long moment said nothing . Then he said , " You can not explain the words ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not explain the words better ? " I told him I did n't understand what he meant . Did he want me to explain them better than the Maharani and the Maharsha ? I asked . Was he saying that the explanations given by the Maharam  | and the Maharsha were wrong ? I spoke very respectfully . What did he mean by better ? I asked . How could I explain them better than the commentaries ? He seemed a little startled by my words . He stood in silence for a moment , his face dark . Then he blinked his eyes and cleared his throat . " Go on , Malter , " he said in a low voice . " Continue to read . " He had not answered my question . I had no classes the next day , Friday , and I spent the morning and early afternoon at home working on a paper for one of my philosophy courses . A bulky package arrived in the mail from my father 's publisher . It was addressed to my father and I would not open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before two o'clock . His hands trembled as he tore open the package . It contained ten copies of his book . They lay on the desk in his study , covered with pale-blue dust jackets , and we looked down at them , and my father picked up one and held it in his hands and opened it and peered at the title page and riffled the pages and closed it and put it back down on the desk . His eyes were moist and his face shone and he stared down at the books and shook his head in disbelief . " So much work , " he murmured . " So much work in those pages . " Then he picked up a copy and turned pages quickly and read and nodded . " Yes , they made the correction , " he said , smiling . " You caught it just in time , Reuven . They were able to correct it . " He put the book down and sat behind his desk . " A book , " he murmured . " It is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book . " I took a copy into my room and lay down on my bed and opened it . I held it close to my face and smelled the ink . I have always loved the smell of ink in a new book . I hoped I had n't overlooked any errors while checking the galleys . I began to read . I was halfway through the fourth page when the phone rang . It was Danny . He was calling to remind me of my visit to Michael on Sunday .  | " Where are you ? " I asked . " 1lome . " Home meant five blocks away in his parents ' brownstone . " You want to come over tomorrow ? " he asked after a moment . I told him I planned to spend Shabbat reading my father 's book which had just arrived in the mail . 1 lc sounded very happy to hear that and asked me to send him a e'opy . I said I would bring a copy over during the week and leave it with his father . " Bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My father wo n't enjoy having to receive a book filled with scientific criticism . " " I low is Michael ? " I asked . " So-so , " he said . " He talked about you again the whole second hour . You never told me you were that good at sailing . " " Does that mean he 's not resisting therapy any more ? I mean the fact that he 's talking so much about me . " " I do n't know what it means yet . " " How 's Rachel ? " I asked . " I 'm seeing her tomorrow night . " I did not say anything . " Have a good Shabbos , " Danny said . " Shabbat shalom , " I said . Later , my father and I went to the small synagogue on Lee Avenue where we prayed the service that welcomes the Shabbat . It was dark when we returned home and a winter wind blew through the naked sycamores on our street . After dinner I took a copy of my father 's book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept burning all through Shabbat , and read . I read until late that night and all of Shabbat afternoon . I read very carefully , on a nervous hunt for errors that might have slipped by us but at the same time reading in order to study again what my father had written . I found no errors and more than half a dozen places where my father 's words took on meanings I had not seen in them before . I marveled at his scholarship . I never ceased being amazed at his scholarship . It was a beautiful book , and I told him so as we sat down to supper .  | His eyes shone behind their steel-rimmed spectacles . " I could n't find any mistakes , " I said . He had found one typographical error , he said . But it was insignificant and did not affect the meaning of his words . " It 's a beautiful book , abba , " I said - again . " Especially the introduction . " " We will see what others have to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critics ? " " A writer always worries about critics , " he said . He looked up at the clock on the shelf over the refrigerator . " It is almost time for Ma'ariv . You are going out tonight , Reuven ? " " Yes . " " I have a Zionist meeting I must attend . You will be home late ? " " No . I want to be wide awake tomorrow . " " You will see Rachel there too ? " " I do n't know . We have to ask Danny about Rachel . " He looked at me . " That 's right , " I said . " Danny and Rachel ? " he asked , his eyes very wide . " Danny Saunders and Rachel Gordon . Saunders and Gordon . Sodium and water . I do n't know which is the sodium and which is the water . But it 's sodium and water , all right . " " Danny and Rachel , " he said again . " Let 's finish up and make Havdalah , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , across the street , stood a Catholic church . At precisely eleven o'clock every Sunday morning the bells of that church would toll . They tolled every hour on the hour every Sunday morning , and we assumed they were tolling to announce the Mass . But we especially noted the eleven-o'clock tolling because it was then that Rav Kalman entered the class . He always came into the class together with the tolling of the bells . That Sunday morning the bells tolled and the door opened and Rav Kalman entered the classroom , carrying his Talmud and the hooks of commentaries under his arms . The Talmud and the other volumes had old , worn brown or black bindings , and so the book with the blue dust jacket was easy to see . I watched him put the Talmud on the desk , then place the books of the commentaries neatly one on top of the other to the right of the Talmud , and the book with the blue dust jacket to the left of the Talmud , face down on the desk . He opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stood there , surveying the class . I sat in my scat , frozen , staring at my father 's book . He lit a cigarette and called on a student to read . Outside , Bedford Avenue was silent , deserted , its black surface glistening in the bright winter sunlight . I saw Rav Kalman glance at me . I looked down at my Talmud and tried to concentrate on the words . Rav Kalman stood behind his desk , smoking and listening to the student . Half an hour before the end of the shiur he sat clown and put his hands against the sides of his face , elbows on the desk , and sat very still . He said almost nothing during that entire two-hour period . A minute before the end of the period , he looked up and told  | the student to stop reading . Then he said quietly to me , " I want to speak with you , Matter , " and he dismissed the class . I remained in my seat and he remained behind his desk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He closed his Talmud and I closed mine . He sat behind his desk , smoking and looking down at his closed Talmud . Sunlight came through the windows onto his tall black skullcap and pale features and dark beard and dark clothes and starched white shirt . The almost milk-white fingers of his right hand drummed soundlessly on the Talmud , the two misshapen fingers moving up and clown together as if operated by a single set of muscles and tendons . His eyes were dark and narrow . " I do not know what to do with you , Malter , " he said . He was silent a moment . " I have never experienced such a problem . " He was silent again . Then he said , " Tell me , Matter . This is the book you were working on in the Zechariah Frankel Seminary ? " I heard myself say , " Yes . " " Tell me again what you did for the book . " I told him I had checked my father 's footnotes and had gone over the many variant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quotations were accurate . " You are familiar with all the manuscripts your father brings in the book ? " " Yes . " " And you are familiar with all the works by other scholars your father quotes ? " " Yes . " " You have studied these works ? " " I know about them . I have n't studied them carefully . " " You study Gemora with your father ? " " Yes . " " And the Gemora you prepare for the shiur , you also study that ( : cnmra with your father ? " " No . Iprepare by myself . " " Rut sometimes when there is a problem with the Gemora you discuss it with your father , yes ? "  | " Yes . " " And sometimes he solves the problem by changing the words ? " " Sometimes . " " You know this method of studying Gemora ? " " Yes . " " Tell me , Malter , why doyou- never use this method in my shiur ? " I stared at him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That is I lie reason ? " " Yes . " He nodded slowly and was silent a moment , his fingers drumming soundlessly on the Talmud . " I have read your father 's book , Malter . I discovered I knew enough English to be able to read it . It was easier for nee to read than the works of Gordon . But I did not understand the Greek words your father uses . Tell me , Malter , you understand Greek ? " " A little , " I said . " You understand the Greek in your father 's book ? " " Yes . " " Then I will ask you to explain some things to me . There are explanations based upon Greek words , and I would like to understand what your father is saying . Come , bring a chair over here , Malter , and sit beside me . You will teach me what your father is saying . " I moved a chair next to him behind the desk and sat down . I felt the blood heating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open my father 's book to one of the very technical scholarly essays that dealt with a passage of Talmud that contained a number of Greek words written in Hebrew letters . " That is a very difficult inyan , Malter . I have never clearly understood that inyan . Your father writes at the end of this chapter that the inyan is very clear to him . Explain it to me , Malter . How does your father make clear the inyan ? " The article only cited the difficult passage . But I knew by heart the entire Talmudic discussion in which that passage was located .  | I reviewed the discussion that led up to the passage . He listened intently . I reviewed some of the remarks of the commentaries on various points in the discussion . Then I read the passage with the Greek words and showed him how the commentaries had struggled with it because they had not known Greek . They had simply not known what to do with the words . Then I explained the meaning of the Greek words and showed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He staled down at the book in silence , his fingers tapping soundlessly on the Talmud , the two misshapen fingers moving together up and down . " You are saying to me that your father understands the Gemora better than the Rishonim ? " " Rishonim " is the Hebrew term for the earliest and greatest of the medieval commentators on the Talmud . I hesitated for a moment . " He understands it differently , " I said . He gazed at me narrowly . " If an understanding of the passage is based on a knowledge of Greek and if the Rishonim did not know Greek , then your father understands the Gemora better than the Rishonim . " I did not respond to that . In a yeshiva you never said that a contemporary scholar could understand Talmud better than the Rishonim . There was an uncomfortable silence . I looked away from him and clown at his fingers drumming soundlessly on the Talmud . " Let me ask you something else , Malter . In this chapter your father explains an inyan by changing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is necessary to change the words in order to understand the inyan . " It was a fairly simple passage and it seemed quite clear to me that an easily identifiable scribal error had been made at one point by someone who had been copying the text . I explained it to him . " 1 low can you change the words of the Gemora ? Just like that you change the words of the Gemora ? By what authority does your fher change words ? " " A lot of the commentaries changed words . The Vilna Gaon  | was always changing words he thought were wrong . " Rabbi Elijah of Vilna , who is known as the Vilna Gaon , was the greatest Talmudist of the eighteenth century . " There 's nothing new about changing words in the Talmud , " I said . Rav Kalman raised his eyebrows . " The Vilna Gaon ? You are comparing your father to the Vilna Gaon ? " I had expected that question . No one in the present could possibly be compared in depth of learning to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commentators of the past had to be accepted as valid . for the present ; and the liberties these commentators had taken with the text could not be practiced today because no one equaled them in knowledge . You could never say that a great contemporary Bible scholar had a better knowledge of the Bible than , say , Rashi , who was one of the greatest medieval commentators on the Bible ; nor could you say that a modern scholar of the Talmud knew more than the accepted classical commentators on the Talmud . I knew that attitude , and so I said nothing to Rav Kalman'sremark . We spent the next few minutes going over some additional passages in my father 's book . I was beginning to feel quite uncomfortable . This was the first time I had ever used this method of study at Hirsch , and it felt strange and awkward , and I kept glancing at the door and worrying about someone suddenly coming into the room and seeing us studying my father 's book . We sat there almost an hour . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stroked his beard and gazed at me intently , then lit a cigarette and dropped the match carefully into the ashtray . " I see you know this method very well , Malter . Your father has taught you well . " He inhaled deeply on the cigarette . Smoke curled froth his mouth and nostrils as he spoke . " I also see you enjoy this method of study . That is very clear to me . Tell me , Malter , do you believe the written Torah is from heaven ? " He was asking me if I believed the Pentateuch had been revealed by God to Moses at Sinai . I hesitated a moment . ThenLsaid , " Yes . "  | He had noticed my hesitation . I saw by the sudden stiffening of his shoulders that he had noticed it . " You believe that every word in the Torah was revealed by God blessed by He to Moses at Sinai ? , " I believe the Torah was revealed , " I said carefully . My own understanding of the revelation was based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to answer that question affirmatively even though I knew mine could not be the same kind of understanding as Rav Kalman 's . " Do you believe the oral Torah was also given to Moses at Sinai ? " He was asking me whether I believed the various discussions of the Talmud had also been revealed by God to Moses at Sinai . He was putting me through a theological loyalty test . " No , " I said . " No ? Then what is the Gemora ? " " It was created by great men who based their traditions and arguments on the Chumash . " " Chumash " is the Hebrew word for the Pentateuch . " You believe this ? " " Yes . " " That is why you use this method ? " " Yes . " " And your father believes this too ? " " Yes . " " Tell me , Malter , your father is an observer of the Commandments ? , " Yes , " I said emphatically . He nodded . " So have I heard , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " I am afraid I really do not know whattodo with you , Malter . " He shook his head again . " I have never had such a problem . Tell me , Malter , do you know who you are ? Who are you ? " I looked at him in bewilderment . " The holy Rav Yisroel Salanter used to say , Know yourself . ' " l lc was talking about the nineteenth-century European rabbi who was the founder of the musar movement . " A person must know  | who he is . A person must understand himself , improve himself , learn his weaknesses in order to overcome them . It is hard.fora person to understand his own weaknesses . I know . Do you know yourself , Malter ? Where do you stand ? Do you stand with true Yiddishkeit , or do you stand perhaps a little bit on the path of Gordon ? Where do you stand , Maker ? " I did not say anything . " I must know where you stand before I can give you smicha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You can not tell me anything ? " Still I was quiet . " Know yourself , Malter . A man who does not know himself is lost . I know this . From bitter experience I know this . You do not have to tell me now , Malter . But you will have to tell me before I give you smicha . I will not give you smicha unless I have an answer from you . The Hasidim are not the only ones who guard the spark . I too have an obligation . " It was a moment before I understood the significance of that remark . " I can not give smicha to someone who does not stand with true Yiddishkeit , no matter how great a Gemora student be is . Do you understand me ? " I nodded . . " I would like to give you smicha , Malter . But I will not give it to you before I know where you stand . " He stared darkly at my father 's book and was quiet for a moment . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pity he uses such a method . He endangers Yiddishkcit with his method . " He looked at me sadly . " We will talk again another time , Malter . Do you have any questions you wish to ask me ? " I shook my head . " No questions . All right . You may go now . " I got to my feet , picked up my Talmud , and started from the room . My legs were trembling . " Malter . " I turned to look at him . He was seated behind the desk . He seemed strangely small and a little forlorn .  | " Speak to me anytime you wish , " he said stiffly . " I am not so difficult to speak to as it sometimes appears . " I nodded and left him at his desk and closed the door softly behind me and leaned heavily against it to steady my legs . The corridor was deserted . The building seemed empty . It was a moment before I remembered my visit with Michael . I looked at my wristwatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got my coat and hat and came out of the building into the bright sunlight . The sky was a deep , clear , cloudless blue . I got to the station just as a train was pulling out and had to wait more than ten minutes for the next train because of the Sunday subway schedule . I sat in the train and barely knew where I was and felt dazed and shaken and did not know what I would do . I wanted to talk to my father . The train roared along its tracks . I thought of Ray Kalman . Know yourself . I thought of Rav Kalman and listened to the clacking of the wheels . The car hurtled around curves and I braced my feet and felt my body swaying . Know yourself . He was forcing me into a choice and I did not know what I could do . The train stopped at a station , then pulled out again , picking up speed swiftly . I closed my eyes and listened to the wheels and felt my body swaying with the motions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a sudden fierce crescendo of screeching wheels and I thought I heard distant screams and shouts from the other passengers and a wild laugh and I opened my eyes and they were all in their seats and I did not close my eyes again the rest of that trip . It was ten after three when the train pulled into my station . I got off quickly and ran through the station and up the stairs into the street . There was a wind now and it was cold and I pulled up the collar of my coat and walked very quickly through a quiet residential area with wide front lawns and expensive homes and old trees along the sidewalks and children on bicycles in the streets , and then crossed to a block where a low stone fence ran around an old rambling graystone house set deep on a huge rolling lawn studded with trees and flower beds and laced with tiny gravel paths . There were cars parked all along the side of the street  | adjacent to the open front gate . Set into the low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small metal plaque that had carved into it the words THE ROBERT H. SELBY RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT CENTER FOR CHILDREN . A gray-uniformed guard stood by the front gate .......... but he barely glanced at me as I went in . There were benches along the paths on the lawn and on some of those benches I saw couples sitting with children who looked to be in their young teens . I went quickly up one of the paths toward the house . I saw children strolling among the trees with adults . I did not see any other uniformed guards . The house was quite large , with wide stone front steps topped by an overhang supported by huge white-painted colonnades . It had three stories , a gabled roof , tall windows trimmed in white , a huge wooden double door in front with large brass hinges and knobs . It seemed a lovely old house , obviously very well kept up , and there were shrubs all around it and more flower beds and tall trees behind it , and people kept going in and coming out of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , . for the sick . I went up the wide stone stairs and through the wooden front door and found myself in a large carpeted foyer with paintings of New England winter scenes on the walls . Near the end of the foyer , and against the right wall , was a small desk behind which sat a man in his middle twenties wearing a dark suit and dark hornrimmed glasses . He glanced at me as I made my way through the foyer and asked very politely if he could be of any help . I told him I had come to visit Michael Gordon and gave him my name . He consulted some cards on his desk and smiled . " Michael is waiting for you right inside . Have a pleasant visit . " The foyer led directly into a huge living room with a beamed ceiling and a dark-green carpet and couches and easy chairs and pale-green drapes on the windows and more New England winter landscapes on the walls , which were paneled with oak . Set into the wall to the left of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mantelpiece . On top of the mantelpiece was a large model of a schooner , its sails white , its hull and masts a deep reddish brown . At the far end of the room was a wide wooden  | staircase carpeted in green and winding upward to the floor above . The banister of the staircase was built of intricately carved oak . There were adults and young teen-age boys sitting around on the couches and easy chairs , talking in quiet voices . They seemed relaxed and quite at ease . I removed my hat and coat and held them in my hands . I stood just inside the entrance to the living room and scanned the room , searching for Michael . I saw a boy seated in an easy chair across the room near one of the windows reading a magazine . I looked around the room but could not find Michael . It was twenty-five minutes past three . He had waited for me and gone . I wondered where he might be and was about to turn back to the desk in the foyer when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to visit Michael Gordon ? " It was the man who had been at the desk . He came alongside me and regarded me curiously . I told him I did n't see Michael anywhere in the room . " He 's right there near the window . " He pointed to the boy with the magazine . I stared and felt my heart turn over . I had not recognized him . His hair was cut and he had lost at least ten pounds and I had not seen him in about four months and now I had not recognized him . " Thank you , " I said , and went quickly through the room and up to Michael . He did not see me come over . He sat leafing through the magazine , his long face very pale , his glasses down along the bridge of his straight nose , all of him looking gaunt and dejected and lonely . The laces of his black shoes were untied . He sat hunched over the magazine , his thin body curved over it , and he turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I stood behind the chair . " Michael , " I said softly . He looked up immediately . " Mello , " I said . Ile jumped to his feet and the magazine fell to the floor and his face broke into a radiant smile . " I thought you forgot . I thought you were n't ? " He stopped  | and smiled and laughed and seemed not to know what to do with his joy . " I 'm sorry to be late . It 's good to see you , Michael . " I offered him my hand . He seemed a little embarrassed to be shaking hands in an adult way . I looked around . Some of the people were gazing at us curiously . I saw one of the young teen-agers , a dark-haired , sullen-faced boy , turn to the man sitting next to him and nod toward Michael and say something softly . The man looked at Michael , then looked away . " Let 's sit down somewhere , " I said . " Over there on the couch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How are you feeling ? What 's wrong ? " " I do n't want to talk to you here . " " Where do you want to go ? " Let 's go to my room . We 'll be alone there . " " Is it all right ? " " Sure . We can go anywhere we want . We just ca n't go off the grounds . " I followed him through the living room to the staircase . He walked quickly . His clothes were too large on him . His jacket hung loose at the shoulders . He stopped at the foot of the stairs and pointed to the corridor that led off to the right . It was brightly lit and carpeted in dark green and lined with offices . " Your friend has his office here , " Michael said . " The third office on the left . That 's where we meet . " " Where do the big doors lead ? ; ' " That 's a recreation room . Then there 's a dining room on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want . ' They make it up special for me . " " Where do you go to school ? " " There 's a separate building out back . You know what they call this house ? A cottage . There 's a married couple that live here and take care of us . They 're supposed to he like our parents . Then there are four men who come in every day , but they do n't live here . A cottage . That 's very funny . " " It looks like a beautiful house . "  | " You think so ? " " Yes . " " I hate it . Let 's go upstairs . " I followed him up the winding carpeted stairway . We went through a double door and down a wide corridor . He stopped in front of a door . " The person on night duty stays here . There 's a phone inside . That 's where I called you from . Come on . We 'll go to my room . Did you bring that article by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room 's two doors away . " " Do you live in it alone ? " " Yes . " " Well , that 's very nice . " " I hate living alone , " he said . His door was unlocked . It was a small room but very clean and neat , with white-painted walls and a rug on the floor and a bed against a wall and a chest of drawers and a bookcase across from the bed . There was a deep closet , and prints of New England landscapes on the walls . A single tall window divided the wall opposite the door . The window was covered by a heavy iron screen . To the right of the window stood a long , black , gleaming telescope mounted on a tripod . Near the door was a desk and a chair . In a corner of the room was a second chair . The room was quite warm and smelled vaguely of disinfectant . Michael sat on the bed and I brought over the corner chair and sat next to him . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . " " I do n't know , " he said quietly , not looking at me . " How have your talks been with my friend ? " " Let me see that article , " he said , turning to me abruptly . " Do n't you want to tell me about yourself first ? " " No . " " I 'd like you to . " " I want to see that article . " " All right . " I took it out of my jacket pocket and handed it to  | him . He snatched it from my hand and read it hungrily . I could sec his eyes racing across the printed lines . His pale face was without expression . He gave it back to me and lay down on the bed and put the palms of his hands under his head and stared up at the ceiling . " You sce what I mean now ? " he said softly . " You see how vicious he is . " I did not say anything . " Why do n't they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I low did you know about the article ? " " My aunt and uncle were talking about it outside the door on a visit . He told her not to mention it to me . " " It 's very warm in here , Michael . Can we open the window ? " " I have to call someone in to do that . They lock the screen from the inside . I ca n't open it myself . " I stared at the screen and saw the lock . I had not noticed it before . " Do you want to go for a walk ? " Michael said . " We could go for a walk and I could show you the grounds . " " If you want to . " " I hate this room anyway . Let 's go for a , walk . " I put on my coat and hat and he put on a knee-length dark-blue winter jacket and we went downstairs and out of the building . It was cold outside and there was a wind . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked along a narrow path between the trees . There were dead leaves on the ground . The hedges were trimmed and there were shallow grooves on the sides of the paths between the gravel and the year-round grass . We passed a one-story gray-brick building with large plate-glass windows , and I could see dark-green blackboards and beige walls and new desk chairs . Michael said nothing as we went by . He walked slightly stooped over , his eyes gazing at the ground near his feet . ' 1 here were not many people outside now . I listened to the wind in the branches of the trees . We walked in silence and came to a small round structure set in among the trees , a lovely pagoda-like structure without walls and with a white circular bench- attached to the carved red  | beams that supported its sharply slanting Oriental-style red roof . Michael stopped and looked at it and I saw his eyes become moist and dreamy , and he pushed his glasses up along the bridge of his nose , then stood very still , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's very pretty , " I said . " It 's beautiful , " he murmured . " It 's my house . " I did not look at him . " Do you  --  live in it ? " I asked . " Not yet . But it 's my house . I 'm going to live in it one day soon . " " Are you going to live in it alone ? " " No . I hate being alone . I only like being alone when I 'm outside . " " Who is going to live in it with you ? " " Rachel . " I kept my eyes on the pagoda and did not look at him . " We 're going to live in it and I 'm going to take care of her . " His voice had a distant dreamy sound to it . " She took care of me all those years and I 'm going to take care of her . " " When did she take care of you ? " " She was very nice when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . And I 'm going to worry about her and take care of her . You can visit us sometimes if you want , Reuven . Yes , I 'd like that . You can visit us if you want . Maybe Rachel will even stay with your children one day when you 're married and you go away on a trip . I used to love to have Rachel stay with me when my parents went traveling to lectures or conferences . " " Does your mother always travel with your father ? " " Yes . Ever since his heart attack . " " And your father does a lot of traveling ? " " He lectures to Jewish students in universities . He comes home very tired and very sad . He 's afraid religion is going to die . Yes , I 'd like you to visit us , Reuven . That would be very nice . Would you promise to visit us ? " " Sure , " I said , still not looking at him .  | " I could set up my telescope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constellations . I never showed you the constellations , did I , Reuven . But I dream a lot that we go sailing right off t he lake and into the sky and I show you the stars . But those are only dreams . How long has it been since we went sailing , Reu-ven ? " " About four months . " " Four months ? Has it been four months ? " He was silent a moment . I could hear the winter wind in the trees . It was very cold now and the sky was pale with the oncoming evening . I saw Michael bend down and pick up a dead leaf and hold it in his hand . It was a sycamore leaf , brown and brittle and papery with death , and he held it in his left hand and with the thumb and forefinger of his right hand he tore a piece of it away and ground it to dust between his fingers . He looked at me . " Why did they put me in here ? " he asked quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did not say anything . He tore away another piece of the leaf . " I do n't understand what I 'm supposed to do . " " People are trying to help you , Michael . " " But what am I supposed to do ? " " Why do n't you talk to Danny  --  to Mr. Saunders about it . " " Mr. Saunders . He 's nice . I like him . Does he always wear a skullcap ? He 's very religious . I think he 's more religious than you are . But he 's honest and I like him . " " Then talk to him , Michael . " About what ? What do they want me to talk about ? " " Are n't there things that are bothering you ? " " I ca n't talk about that . " " Why not ? " " I ca n't . " " But why not , Michael ? " " I do n't know . I ca n't . " He tore off another piece of the leaf and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I want to go home . Ca n't you tell them to let me go home ? "  | " I ca n't do anything like that , Michael . " " How do I get out of here ? Am I supposed to be here all my life ? " " Talk to Mr. Saunders about it . " " You wo n't help me ? " " I think we had better go back . It 's getting dark . " " Okay , " he said quietly . He closed the palm of his left hand over the remaining portion of the leaf and crushed it and let it fall slowly to the ground . He looked at the pagoda . " I do n't think I 'm going to invite you to visit us . I do n't think I 'd want that at all . " He walked off . I followed behind him . A few feet before the wide stone staircase in front of the house , he stopped abruptly and turned to me . " Did you read that article ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " " Of course . " " Why dues-he-say those-things about my father ? " " He disagrees with him , Michael . " " But why does he have to say those things about him ? My father is killing himself for religion . Why does he say those things ? " " That 's the way Rav Kalman expresses himself , Michael . You should n't take it so seriously . " " But they 're all like that , Reuven . Why are they all like that ? " I did not say anything . " I do n't understand it . I do n't understand any of it . " He started up the stone stairway . I walked alongside him . We were almost to the wooden double door at the head of the stairs when it was opened from inside and Ruth and Abraham Gordon came quickly out . Michael saw them and ran up the few remaining steps and I saw Abraham Gordon , hatless , his coat collar raised  --  I saw Abraham Gordon spread his arms wide and then close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They embraced a long time and Abraham Gordon kissed his son on the forehead and then Michael embraced his mother and kissed her and I could see  | they were all fighting back their tears . Abraham Gordon put his arm around Michael 's shoulders and turned his head to me and nodded toward the door , and I followed them through the door and the foyer and into the living room . We sat on a couch near one of the windows . The living room was almost empty . I sat very still and listened to Michael and his parents talk . Did he need anything ? his mother asked him gently . She looked very beautiful in a dark-blue woolen suit and a small white hat over her chestnut hair . But she seemed fatigued and there were dark circles under her eyes . No , he did not need anything , Michael replied . Why was n't he eating ? she asked . Michael stared down at the carpeted floor and was silent . Had he read the Hebrew books they brought him last time ? his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he want any more books on astronomy ? Yes . Was he able to use his telescope ? Sometimes . The talk moved on to the activities of relatives and friends . They talked quietly together , intimate family talk , and finally Ruth Gordon turned to me and asked how the visit had been , and before I could respond Michael said , " It was a wonderful visit . Reuven promised to come next Sunday too . Did n't you , Reuven ? " I had made no such promise . But I nodded . " I 'm so very pleased you had a good visit , " Ruth Gordon said . " When can I go home ? " Michael asked suddenly . Abraham and Ruth Gordon looked at each other uncomfortably . " Not fora while yet , " Abraham Gordon said quietly . Michael did not ask them again . They talked a while longer about some of the trips AbraMiii Gordon was making to universities and the book he was writing and how Mother was up very late every night editing the manuscript and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of , their feelings from him and at one point there were tears in all their eyes and Ruth Gordon cried silently and Abraham Gordon put his arm around her shoulders and Michael looked at his mother and I saw tears flowing down his cheeks .
