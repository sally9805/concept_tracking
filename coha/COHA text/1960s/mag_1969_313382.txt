WITH considerable unhappiness , moneymen still vividly recall the episode in the late summer of 1966 that came to be known as " the credit crunch . " Restricting the nation 's money supply in order to slow a rapid price rise , the Federal Reserve Board acted so decisively that the financial markets reacted with hysteria . Interest rates rose rapidly , the Dow Jones average sank 25% , and many lenders were so short of funds that it became extraordinarily tough for corporations to borrow at all . <P> The Federal Reserve has been fighting inflation in much the same way so far in 1969 , but until now the results have been less severe . Last week the board 's policy of " resolute restraint , " as Chairman William McChesney Martin describes it , hit home so hard that many bankers concluded that another crisis is imminent . " This is certainly the worst credit squeeze since 1966 , " said Beryl Sprinkel , chief economist of Chicago 's Harris Trust &; Savings Bank . " The question is whether it will get as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that direction . " <P> Back to Rationing . To conserve scarce funds , most banks are turning down new corporate customers and rationing loans to regulars . Some are cutting off finance companies and mortgage-banking firms and generally refusing loans to finance corporate takeovers . The pressure is strongest on banks in the East and on the West Coast because they deal with many large corporations that need money to expand . The cost of borrowing , already at a 40-year peak , continues to rise . Bankers have stepped up their prime rate four times in the past six months , to an alltime high 7% , and speculation is widespread that they will soon increase it again . That expectation helped to depress the stock market last week . The Dow Jones industrial average fell 10 points to 938 . <P> The most glaring trouble signals came from the jittery bond market , which ordinarily supplies 95% of the capital needed to finance U.S. business expansion . Some bond dealers describe trading conditions as the most disorderly in memory . So many banks are unloading their bond holdings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer " shock prices " to sell new issues at all . Southern New England Telephone Co. last week paid 7.723% interest-the highest for any unit of A.T . &; T. since 1921-to bring out $65 million in debentures . <P> All the " crunch " talk-the word was on nearly every banker 's and broker 's tongue last week-delights the Federal Reserve . The board interprets the commotion as evidence that its tight-money policy is now beginning to force banks to make difficult decisions about what to do with their funds , instead of trying to dodge monetary discipline by scraping up money abroad . So far this year , the Federal Reserve has allowed the U.S. money supply to grow at an annual rate of less than 2% . That is sharply below the inflationary 11% growth allowed in the second half of 1968 , when the board followed an expansive policy that Martin now admits was an error . Today 's economy is growing far faster than the supply of money available to finance that growth . Ultimately , the resulting collision between the demand and supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business activity .
