MY LIFE IN THE MOUNTAINS AND ON THE PLAINS by David Meriwether. 301 pages . University of Oklahoma . $5.95 . <P> <P> David Meriwether is solidly fixed in the history of the Old West as a vigorous and colorful Governor of the New Mexico Territory . But until the appearance of this autobiography , now published for the first time some 72 years after Meriwether 's death , few will have known anything about his early life as a frontiersman and Indian trader . Dictated by Meriwether to a granddaughter in 1886 , when he was 85 , the manuscript was hidden away as a family heirloom until a great-granddaughter made it available for publication . <P> Punishment at the Post . Part of the narrative 's charm is that the old man did not consciously set out to recount history , but only to leave his descendants a straightforward personal account of all he saw and did . And that was considerable . One of Meriwether 's earliest memories , for example , is of the massacre at Pigeon Roost , Kentucky , when Indian followers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven , but his father sent him off on horseback to warn the Kentucky countryside that the Indians were on the rampage . At 14 , he rode 100 miles in 48 hours carrying military dispatches .

Then the regimental surgeon sliced off their ears . One of the victims , wiping away the blood that streamed down his neck , quipped : " This is a hell of a way , Colonel , to celebrate the Fourth of July . " The colonel clapped him into a ball and chain . That night the soldier jumped into the river and drowned . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it took a tough and stubborn man even to survive on the frontier . Mostly because he was big and brawny , and adept with both his fists and a gun , he managed quite well . But even after he became territorial Governor of New Mexico , he had to sleep with a shotgun by his side because some rowdy opponents threatened to tar and feather him . He had contempt for anyone who walked away from a fight . That included famed Kit Carson , who served under him as an Indian agent . Carson prudently ran away and hid when a gathering of Ute and Apache Indians became threatening . Meriwether suspended him forthwith . After Carson sent an abject letter of apology , Meriwether grudgingly reinstated him , but as long as the semiliterate Carson remained in his service Meriwether issued reprimands about his sloppy administration . " Poor Kit , " he said , " was a good trapper , hunter , and guide , and . . . had acquired a reputation which spoiled him , and which in after life and in a higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
