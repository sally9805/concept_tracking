FOR the fifth time in 18 months , the finely balanced monetary system that is the foundation of Western commerce tumbled into chaos . The crisis threatened to paralyze the system of fixed-exchange rates that has been fostering a rapid growth of trade , tourism and general prosperity . For the moment , world leaders seemed powerless to devise a lasting solution . The all but certain prospect is that more , and perhaps worse , trouble lies ahead . <P> The turbulence began with a modest run on the wobbly franc after Charles de Gaulle resigned and speculators became convinced that France would order a long-anticipated devaluation ( TIME , May 9 ) . Then , last week , the attack on the franc turned into a far more disruptive rush to buy West German marks . Convinced that economically potent Germany must soon raise the official value of its robust currency , speculators and more conservative businessmen all over the world swapped their money for marks in the expectation of a quick profit . A speculator who converted $2,500,000 into marks , for example , stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 7% , as had been widely expected . <P> Unequivocal Decision . As the flood of funds into Germany grew to $3 billion by some estimates , near panic swept European currency markets . Present arrangements call for each Western government to keep the official price of its money within 1% of its stated value . In an effort to hold the line , Denmark and Norway suspended all dealings in foreign money . France , Britain , Italy , Belgium and other countries were forced to dip into their reserves and sell dollars to maintain the official price of their own currencies . Despite all this , in stunning defiance of the world 's financial experts , West Germany 's political leaders at week 's end ruled out any upward revaluation of the mark from its present official level of 25 ? . " The decision , " insisted Government Spokesman Conrad Ahlers , " is final , unequivocal and for eternity . The government now expects and hopes that the speculation over the mark will end . " <P> That is unlikely . In comparison with most other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 10% ; the disparity between it and the French franc may be as much as 15% or 20% . Speculation in marks may subside for a while , as happened after the Germans refused to revalue last November . But as before , it will probably resume after a few months . Until the mark moves up and the franc moves down , closer to their real value , financial markets will remain unsettled . <P> Indiscreet Talk . Last week 's decision outraged many of Germany 's trading partners , who saw it as a shortsighted and selfish maneuver that threatens their own economies . The French are bound to feel that the Germans are trying to force them into devaluing just after their June 1 presidential elections . The British rightly fear that their fragile pound will come under renewed speculative attack . Britain 's foreign debts far exceed its reserves of gold and foreign money , and sterling may be able to cling to its $2.40 rate only if international creditors give the British more time to repay .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
