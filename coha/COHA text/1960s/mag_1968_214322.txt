Cultural traditions die hard in history-conscious China . But they do die , as devotees of the highly stylized form of music drama called Peking opera are beginning to learn . The death is especially painful when the executioner is China 's cultural queen , Chiang Ching , the wife of Communist Party Chairman Mao Tse-tung . <P> For 200 years , Peking opera has been not only the most popular of all the Chinese operatic styles but practically a national pastime . The plots are familiar tales about kings and concubines , scholars and lute-playing ladies . The performers , in elaborate costumes and makeup , convey their characterizations through a series of ritualistic actions and formal gestures ( the closing of a door , for example , is indicated by bringing the hands together ) . Although shrill and piercing to Western ears , the singing is delicately modulated and full of virtuoso flourishes , which Chinese audiences applaud with shouts of " Hao ! " Realism , not Ritual . After the Communist takeover in 1949 , Peking opera , like most of the arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until recently , a limited repertory of traditional Peking operas was being performed regularly in most of China 's theaters . Then Madame Mao got busy undermining the works . Convinced that the arts should " protect our socialist economic base , " she personally supervised the creation of new " revolutionary " librettos that would convert the opera stage from esthetic to political purposes . <P> Her six model productions are revolutionary in more than one sense . All the traditional elements of Peking opera except the singing have disappeared . Antiseptic plots portray the struggles of workers , peasants and soldiers against landlords and imperialists . The performers , appearing in subdued makeup and homespun cotton garments , substitute unadorned realism for symbolic ritual . The scores are laden with inspirational hymns and martial effects . <P> Arias , not Action . The most radical of all these works is The Red Lantern , which recounts the heroism of a family in the Communist underground during the war against Japan . Madame Mao has ordered drastic changes for the production . She has banished the traditional Chinese orchestra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up before a lone grand piano and a percussion section and intone arias ( " I Am Filled With Courage and Strength " ) while the action takes place offstage . The scene is bizarre because only two years ago the piano was condemned as an instrument for " bourgeois spiritual aristocrats . " Now it is revered as a creation of " the laboring people . " <P> At the biennial Canton Trade Fair last week , The Red Lantern was put on for Chinese and foreign visitors and broadcast over Canton television . Also , a truncated version of the work ( two soloists , eight arias ) has now been made into a 35-minute film for showing inside and outside China . It is about as ex citing as a Communist indoctrination lecture-which is what it is . Even the workers and peasants who have been marshalled into showings have shown enthusiasm only when a picture of Mao himself has appeared . In response to Chinese critics who compared her new style to " insipid water , " Madame Mao replied : " What 's wrong with insipid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made . " As yet , no trace of wine has appeared .
