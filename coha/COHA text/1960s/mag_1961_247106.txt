Americans are often accused of being painfully self-conscious about their society and its failings . But Americans are curiously oblivious to some of their society 's achievements . It took foreign visitors to point out how remarkable it was that in the U.S. automobile workers drive to work in their own cars . Similarly unnoticed is another achievement of U.S. culture . The orphanage , that bleak institution that has outraged human sensibilities from the time of Oliver Twist to Little Annie Roomy , has all but vanished . <P> The reasons are manifold , and the process has been gradual , a function of both the U.S. 's long social conscience and its incredibly productive economy . Thanks to better medical care , there are fewer orphans today . Few mothers die in childbirth ; fathers live longer . Even if the father dies , social security payments enable a mother to keep her children with her . Furthermore , almost any average childless couple that wants a child can afford one . Result : more couples clamoring for babies than there are babies to adopt-and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Still , a new kind of problem child has replaced the vanishing orphan in the U.S. 's conscience . He is the child who is homeless as a result of divorce , illegitimacy , parental abuse or mental illness-orphaned in spirit if not in fact . There are 283,000 of these children . About 96,000-the emotionally disturbed , the mentally retarded , the medically ill-are cared for in special institutions . The rest are the beneficiaries of that phenomenal revolution in society , the foster home . <P> Vagrant Packs . Scarcely 50 years ago , civilized Americans thought of children as belonging to one of two classes : those with families and those without . The neglected and orphaned were hauled off to Dickensian institutions to live in lockstepped desperation ; and when the orphanages were filled , the rest were left to roam the cities in vagrant packs or were rounded up and shipped to agricultural communities to be palmed off on farmers in need of kitchen and field help . <P> Urged on by such reformers as Novelist Theodore Dreiser , President Theodore Roosevelt in 1909 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dependent Children . That meeting established the seemingly simple principle that a child was better off with a family , even if it was not his own , than he was in the cold and impersonal atmosphere of an institution . As Roosevelt said , " Home life is the highest and finest product of civilization . Children should not be deprived of it except for urgent and compelling reasons . "
