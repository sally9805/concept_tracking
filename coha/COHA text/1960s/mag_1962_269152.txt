The government of Israel last week executed Adolf Eichmann with all deliberate speed . <P> His day in court had lasted four months ; after he was found guilty of " contributing " to the Nazi mass murder of 6,000,000 Jews , his appeal of the verdict was considered for nine weeks by the Israeli Supreme Court , and then denied , with the remark that even death was not an adequate penalty for Eichmann . As a last recourse , Eichmann made a personal plea for clemency to Israel 's President Izhak Ben-Zvi . Within 34 hours a prison commissioner told Eichmann that his plea had been rejected . He grimaced slightly , said , " Jawohl . " <P> Fearing that pressure for clemency might build up abroad , the Israeli Cabinet decided to act quickly . Before midnight , warders entered Eichmann 's cell on the third floor of Ramla prison , near Tel Aviv . He had drunk half a bottle of Carmel , a dry red Israeli wine , while awaiting their arrival . To the Rev. William Hull , a Canadian-born Evangelist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " Today I am not prepared to discuss the Bible . I do n't have time to waste . " Then the cell door swung open and the party marched down the corridor and into a small 10-ft. by 10-ft. room . <P> Eichmann , clad in brown slacks and a brown , open-necked shirt , took his position on a black-painted trap door beneath a beam from which a noose dangled . His arms were bound behind him , and he refused the proffered black hood . Face white , voice rasping , he sent greetings to his wife , his family and his friends . He repeated the essence of his defense : " I had to obey the laws of war and of my flag . " As the noose was placed about his neck , the condemned man spoke his last words : " After a short while , gentlemen , we all shall meet again . Such is the fate of all men . I have lived believing in God and , believing in God , I die . " <P> Seconds later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( Ready ) , and then " Peheel ! " ( Action ) . The trap door fell open , and Eichmann 's body , plunging out of sight into the room below , swung slightly at the end of the rope . The corpse was cut down , carried to a corner of the prison grounds where , in swirls of ground fog , it was thrust into an aluminum oven with a chimney at one end . A gas fire burned for two hours , reducing Eichmann 's light frame to a handful of ashes . While the body was cremated , black smoke poured into the sky . None of the watching officials and reporters said a word , but the memory of the evil holocausts of Auschwitz was inevitable . <P> Long ago , the Israeli government had decided that to bury Eichmann 's remains would mean desecrating Israeli soil . So , in a nickel container , Eichmann 's ashes were taken 18 miles out to sea aboard an Israeli patrol boat and , as the sun rose over the mist-hung Mediterranean , scattered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
