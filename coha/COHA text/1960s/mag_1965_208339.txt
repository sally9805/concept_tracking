Along Broadway he seems to be everywhere . The newlyweds are using his skylit walkup in Barefoot in the Park , and The Odd Couple ( see THEATER ) has just moved into his drab , cluttered flat . In Luv they are leaping off his bridge ; gypsies are dancing in his fortunetelling parlor in Bajour . Sherlock Holmes is struggling with Moriarty on his cliffs of Dover in Baker Street ; Ben Franklin is still joyously ascending in his balloon ; and Dolly is giving her big hello from his Yonkers streetcar . In all , the seven sets account for more than one-third of the shows on Broadway , and all seven are the work of kinetic , white-haired Oliver Smith , 47 . <P> He is a man for all scenes and the delight of all producers . " Most designers are masters of a single color , " notes Producer David Merrick . " So if the basic color of your show is red , you get so-and-so ; if it 's green , you get somebody else . You can get Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home in all genres and periods-from the romantic realism of his squalid bed-sitter in A Taste of Honey to the sculptural expressionism of his revolving turntable for Dylan . He is also uniquely fast ( he splashed out 250 watercolor sketches for Hollywood 's Oklahoma ! in a fortnight ) , prodigiously productive ( eight Broadway openings this season and a lifetime score of some 250 shows ) , and justly celebrated , with more Tony awards-six-than any other Broadway designer . <P> Three Fairs in One . Smith confesses to have been stage-struck ever since he saw Carmen at age ten in Buffalo , but he took a roundabout route to Broadway . He studied architecture at Penn State , did a stint as a Roxy usher ( " The stage design was hideous " ) , tried selling mackinaws in Gimbels ' basement . He was also a member of the mnage in the Brooklyn Heights town house shared by W. H. Auden , Benjamin Britten , Carson McCullers and Richard Wright . Smith was the dishwasher and furnace man . He also thought he was a painter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saroyan , who instantly commissioned Smith , then 23 , to design his Beautiful People for Broadway . <P> Smith established himself within a year , mostly doing ballet backdrops , soon added a staff of up to four in the busy season . But they were only mockup builders and draftsmen to turn the Smith brainstorms into blueprints , for Smith has always been his own idea man . His most lasting innovation was the development of mobile scenery : his choreographed ballroom stopped the show in the midst of My Fair Lady . But Smith has never been criticized for scene stealing . He just takes them when they are there for the taking . In a viable writer 's show like The Odd Couple , Smith abstemiously designs " a set no one will ever notice . " It is primarily in musicals with undernourished books that he lets fly . Prime examples : Camelot , which glittered as if it had been ripped from a medieval Book of Hours , and was called by Critic John McClain " the most beautiful show in the world . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Walter Kerr to " three world 's fairs rolled into one . "
