Jean Harlow wrote it , with the help of an M-G-M journeyman . Completed before Harlow 's death , the manuscript has been hidden away for the past 32 years . Published last week in the midst of a harrowing Harlow revival , Today Is Tonight ( Grove Press ; $5 ) reads like the first crude script of a Harlow movie-happy but sappy , and crammed with such insights as : " Funny that a man should want you tanned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl who brought back the bosom also had a brain , but on the textual evidence , it can be said that she was at most a size 32A in the literary department . <P> <P> In a corner of Manhattan 's Shepheard 's discothque , on the dance floor of the Waldorf ballroom , gradually more in public view , New York City 's Widower Mayor Robert Wagner , 55 , had been squiring his deputy 's sister , blonde , socially registered Barbara Cavanagh , 36 .
