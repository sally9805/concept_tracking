In many ways , the traditional U.S. courtroom seems only too well designed for blind justice . Jutting into the room like an oversize Murphy bed , the judge 's bench often obstructs the view of jury members so much that they can not see exhibits that lawyers show the judge . Equally bad , the jury has only a side view of the witness stand and can not see the fullface expressions of witnesses under questioning . The judge is even worse off : only by craning his neck can he see anything but the back of a witness ' head , and he must swivel a full 90 to catch jury-box dozers . <P> A drastically different design ( see cut ) is now being tested in a Tacoma , Wash. , federal district court . Breaking with a pattern that dates back to the Middle Ages , Judge George Boldt , 60 , moved his bench into a corner , put the witness stand in his old spot , stationed the jury box so that jurors can look directly at the witness , and gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and questioning witnesses . <P> After a thorough tryout , Judge Boldt pronounced his new courtroom " greatly preferable " to the old design on a number of counts . Because the jury box and bench are far apart , he found that he could confer with attorneys off the record without having to dismiss the jury -a time-wasting maneuver in other courtrooms . He also noted a " calmness and ease " during trials because " everybody could see and hear without strain . " He liked especially his more direct view of the witness stand ( " I can practically take a head-on look " ) and his eyeline relation to the jury ( " The judge can look from one juror to another , and each juror understands that he is being spoken to individually " ) . So many of Judge Boldt 's colleagues are enthusiastic about his new courtroom that the Gen eral Services Administration , which bosses the construction of new Govern ment buildings , is considering adopting the design for future federal district courts .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
