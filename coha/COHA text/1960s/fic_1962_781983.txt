" He was almost crying now , his big ugly florid walnut-tough walnut-hard face wrung and twisted like a child 's . " Even if I managed to get another pistol somewhere to shoot Son Thomas with , I 'd likely miss him too . " Father got up , quickly and briskly . He was the only one sitting down ; even Judge Stevens was standing spraddled on the hearth before the cold fireplace with his hands under his coattails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning . " I must get back to work , " Father said . " What does the old saw say about idle hands ?

" I could come back now , without waiting to Monday , " Ludus said . " Iffen you needs me . " " No , " Father said . We  --  Father and I and Boon  --  went on down the stairs , to the street . It was still First Saturday and trade day , but that 's all it was now  --  that is , until somebody else named Boon Hogganbeck got hold of another pistol . We went on back along the street toward the stable , Father and I and Boon ; he spoke now across the top of my head toward the back of Father 's : " A dollar a week for two hundred dollars is a year and forty-eight weeks . That window of Ike 's will be another ten or fifteen I reckon , besides that girl that got in the way . Say two years and three months . I 've got about forty dollars in money . If I gave you that as a cash down payment , I still do nt reckon you 'd put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty stalls and lock the door for ten minutes . Would you ? " " No , " Father said .  | That was Saturday . Ludus was back at work Monday morning . On the next Friday my grandfather  --  the other one , Mother 's father , your great-grandfather 's father ? died in Bay St. Louis . Boon did n't actually belong to us . I mean , not solely to us , the Priests . Or rather I mean the McCaslins and Edmondses , of whom we Priests are what might be called the cadet branch . Boon had three proprietors : not only us , as represented by Grandfather and Father and Cousin Ike McCaslin and our other cousin , Zachary Edmonds , to whose father , McCaslin Edmonds , Cousin Ike on his twenty-first birthday had abdicated the McCaslin plantation  --  he belonged not just to us but to Major de Spain and General Compson too until he died . Boon was a corporation , a holding company in which  | the three of us  --  McCaslins , De Spain , and General Compson  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one and only corporation rule being that whoever was nearest at the crises would leap immediately into whatever breach Boon had this time created or committed or simply fallen heir to ; he ( Boon ) was a mutual benevolent protective benefit association , of which the benefits were all Boon 's and the mutuality and the benevolence and the protecting all ours . His grandmother had been the daughter of one of old Issetibbeha 's Chickasaws who married a white whiskey trader ; at times , depending on the depth of his cups , Boon would declare himself to be at least ninety-nine onehundredths Chickasaw and in fact a lineal royal descendant of old Issetibbeha himself ; the next time he would offer to fight any man who dared even intimate that he had one drop of Indian blood in his veins . He was tough , faithful , brave and completely unreliable ; he was six feet four inches tall and weighed two hundred and forty pounds and had the mentality of a child ; over a year ago Father had already begun to say that at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although he was obviously a perfectly normal flesh-and-blood biological result ( vide the moments in his cups when he was not merely ready and willing but even eager to fight any man or men either pro or con , depending on how the drink had taken him , for the right to ancestry ) and hence he had to have been somewhere during those first nine or ten or eleven years , it was as if Boon had been created whole and already nine or ten or eleven years old , by the three of us , McCaslin-De Spain-Compson , as a solution to a dilemma one day at Major de Spain 's hunting camp . That 's right , the same camp which you will probably continue to call McCaslin 's camp for a few years after  | your Cousin Ike is gone , just as we  --  your fathers  --  continued to call it De Spain 's camp for years after Major de Spain was gone . But in the time of my fathers , when Major de Spain bought or borrowed or leased the land ( however men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 70 ) and built the lodge and stables and kennels , it was his camp : who culled and selected the men he considered worthy to hunt the game he decreed to be hunted , and so in that sense not only I. owned who hunted it but where they hunted and even what : the bear and deer , and wolves and panthers also ranged it then , less than twenty miles from Jefferson ? the four or five sections of river-bottom jungle which had been a portion of old Thomas Sutpen 's vast kingly dream which in the end had destroyed not only itself but Sutpen too , which in those days was a sort of eastern gateway to the still almost virgin wilderness of swamp and jungle which stretched westward from the hills to the towns and plantations along the Mississippi . It was only twenty miles then ; our fathers could leave Jefferson at midnight in buggies and wagons ( a man on a horse did it even quicker ) on the fifteenth of November and be on a deer- or bear-stand by daybreak . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the wagons bearing the guns and food and bedding had merely to start at sundown ; and now a northern lumber company had built a narrow-gauge railroad for hauling logs , which connected with the main line , passing within a mile of Major de Spain 's new camp , with a courtesy stop to let Major de Spain and his guests off , to be met by the wagons which had gone in the day before . Though by 1925 we could already see the doom . Major de Spain and the rest of that old group , save your Cousin Ike and Boon , were gone now and ( there was gravel now all the way from Jefferson to De Spain 's  | flag stop ) their inheritors switched off their automobile engines to the sound of axes and saws where a year ago there had been only the voices of the running hounds . Because Manfred de Spain was a banker , not a hunter like his father ; he sold lease , land and timber and by 1940 ( it was McCaslin 's camp now ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drive two hundred miles over paved highways to find enough wilderness to pitch tents in ; though by 198o the automobile will be as obsolete to reach wilderness with as the automobile will have made the wilderness it seeks . But perhaps they  --  you  --  will find wilderness on the back side of Mars or the moon , with maybe even bear and deer to run it . But then , when Boon materialized at the camp one day , full panoplied and already ten or eleven or twelve years old , there were only twenty miles for Major de Spain and General Compson and McCaslin Edmonds and Walter Ewell and old Bob Legate and the half-dozen others who would come and go , to travel . But General Compson , although he had commanded troops not too unsuccessfully as a colonel at Shiloh , and again not too unsuccessfully as a brigadier during Johnston 's retreat on Atlanta , was a little short in terrain , topography , and would promptly get lost ten minutes after he left camp ( the mule he preferred to ride would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a paroled Confederate general but a Compson too , he declined to accept counsel or advice from a mule ) , so as soon as the last hunter was in from the morning 's drive , everyone would take turns blowing a horn until General Compson at last got in . Which was satisfactory , anyway served , until General Compson 's hearing began to fail too . Until finally one afternoon Walter Ewell and Sam Fathers , who was half Negro and half Chickasaw Indian , had to track him down  | and camp in the woods with him all night , facing Major de Spain with the alternative of either forbidding him to leave the tent or expelling him from the club , when lo , there was Boon Hogganbeck , already a giant , even at ten or eleven already bigger than General Compson , whose nurse he became  --  a waif , who seemed to have nothing and know nothing but his name ; even Cousin Ike is not sure whether it was McCaslin Edmonds or Major de Spain who found Boon first where whoever bore him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that Boon was already there , about twelve years old , out at old Carothers McCaslin 's place , where McCaslin Edmonds was already raising Ike as if he was his father and now and without breaking stride took over Boon too as though he had been Boon 's father also , though at that time McCaslin Edmonds himself was only thirty . Anyway , as soon as Major de Spain realised that he must either expel General Compson from the club , which would be difficult , or forbid him to leave the camp , which would be impossible , and hence he must equip General Compson with something resembling a Boon Hogganbeck , there was the Boon Hogganbeck , produced either by McCaslin Edmonds or perhaps by both of them  --  Edmonds and De Spain himself  --  in simultaneous crisis . Ike could remember that : the loading of the bedding and guns and food into the wagon on the fourteenth of November , with Tennie 's Jim ( grandfather of this Bobo Beauchamp of whom you will hear presently ) and Sam Fathers and Boon ( he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another four or five years before he would be ten and could make one also ) and McCaslin himself riding ahead on the horse , to the camp where each morning Boon would follow General Compson on a second mule until by simple force probably , since at twelve Boon was already bigger than his charge ,  | Boon would compel him to the right direction in time to reach camp before dark . Thus General Compson made a woodsman of Boon despite himself , you might say , in simple sell-defense . But even eating at the same table and ranging the same woods and sleeping in the same rain even with Walter Ewell never made a marksman of him ; one of the camp 's favorite stories was about Boon 's shooting , told by Walter Ewell : of being on a stand where he had left Boon ( old General Compson had gone to his fathers at last  --  or to whatever bivouac old soldiers of that war , blue or gray either , probably insisted on going to since probably no place would suit them for anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular hunter like anybody else ) and of hearing the hounds and realising that the deer was going to cross at Boon 's stand , then of hearing the five shots from Boon 's ramshackle pump gun ( General Compson had bequeathed it to him ; it had never been in the best condition while Compson owned it and Walter said his real surprise was that the gun had fired even twice without jamming , let alone five times ) and then Boon 's voice across the woods between them : " God damn ! Yonder he goes ! Head him ! Head him ! " And how he  --  Walter  --  hurried across to Boon 's stand and found the five exploded shells on the ground and not ten paces away the prints of the running buck which Boon had not even touched . Then Grandfather bought that automobile and Boon found his soul 's mate . By this time he was officially ( by mutual McCaslin-Edmonds-Priest consent , even McCaslin Edmonds having given up or seen the light at last when Boon failed the third grade for the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that Boon would never stay on any farm long enough to learn to be a farmer ) a member of the livery stable staff . At first  | the jobs were mostly still the odd ones  --  feeding , cleaning harness and buggies . But I told you he had a way with horses and mules , and soon he was a regular driver of hired vehicles  --  hacks and cabs which met the daytime trains , and the buggies and surreys and light wagons in which the drummers made the rounds of the country stores . He lived in town now , except when McCaslin and Zachary both were away at night and Boon would sleep in the house to protect the women and children . I mean , he lived in Jefferson . I mean , he actually had a home  --  a single rented room in what in my grandfather 's time was the Commercial Hotel , established in hopeful rivalry of the Holston House but never making the grade in that rivalry . But solid enough : where juries were lodged and fed during court terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at ease than among the carpets and brass cuspidors and leather chairs and linen tablecloths across town ; then in my time the Snopes Hotel with both hand-painted esses upside down when Mr Flem Snopes ( the banker , murdered ten or twelve years ago by the mad kinsman who perhaps did n't believe his cousin had actually sent him to the penitentiary but at least could have kept him out or anyway tried to ) began to lead his tribe out of the wilderness behind Frenchman 's Bend , into town ; then for a brief time in the mid-thirties leased by a brassyhaired gentlewoman who came briefly from nowhere and went briefly back , known to your father and the police as Little Chicago ; and which you know , those glories but memories now , as Mrs Rouncewell 's boarding house . But in Boon 's time it was still the Commercial Hotel ; in the intervals between sleeping on the floor of some Compson or Edmonds or Priest kitchen , he was living there when my grandfather bought the automobile . My grandfather did n't want an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . A banker , president of the older Bank of Jefferson , the first bank in Yoknapatawpha County , he believed then and right on to his death many years afterward , by which time everybody else even in Yoknapatawpha County had realised that the automobile had come to stay , that the motor vehicle was an insolvent phenomenon like last night 's toadstool and , like the fungus , would vanish with tomorrow 's sun . But Colonel Sartoris , president of the newer , the mushroom Merchants and Farmers Bank , forced him to buy one . Or rather , another insolvent , a dreamy myopic gentian-eyed mechanical wizard named Buffaloe , compelled him to . Because my grandfather 's car was n't even the first one in Jefferson . ( I do nt count Manfred de Spain 's red E.M.F. racer . Although De Spain owned it and drove it daily through Jefferson streets for several years , it had no more place in the decorous uxorious pattern of a community than Manfred himself did , both of them being incorrigible and bachelor , not in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one prolonged unbroken Saturday night even while Manfred was actually mayor , its very scarlet color being not even a scornful defiance of the town but rather a kind of almost inattentive disavowal . ) Grandfather 's was not even the first automobile to see Jefferson or vice versa . It was not even the first one to inhabit Jefferson . Two years before , one had driven all the way down from Memphis , making the eightymile trip in less than three days . Then it rained , and the car stayed in Jefferson two weeks , during which time we almost had no electric lights at all ; nor , if the livery stable had depended solely on Boon , no public transportation either . Because Mr Buffaloe was the man  --  the one man , the sole human being nearer than Memphis who knew how to  --  who kept the steam-driven electric plant  | running ; and from the moment the automobile indicated that it was not going any further , at least today , Mr Buffaloe and Boon were inseparable from it like two shadows , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smelling of ammonia and harness oil , and the little greasecovered soot-colored man with eyes like two bluebird feathers moulted onto a small lump of coal , who would barely have tipped a hundred pounds with all his ( the city 's too ) tools in his pockets  --  the one motionless , staring at the car with a kind of incredulous yearning , like a fixed bull ; the other dreaming at it , gentle , tender , his grimed hand gentle as a woman 's as he touched it , stroked it , caressed it , then the next moment plunged to the hips under the raised bonnet . Then it rained all that night and was still raining the next morning . The owner of the car was told , assured ? by Mr Buffaloe , it appeared ; a little strange since nobody had ever known him to be far enough away from the light plant or the little shop in his back yard , to have ever used roads enough to prophesy their condition ? that the roads would be impassable for at least a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Memphis by train , leaving the automobile to be stored in what , in anybody else 's back yard but Mr Buffaloe 's , would have been a horse- or cow-barn . Nor could we figure this : how Mr. Buffaloe , a meek mild almost inarticulate little man in a constant condition of unworldly grease-coated dreamlike somnambulism  --  how , by what means , what mesmeric and hypnotic gifts which until now even he could not have known he possessed , he had persuaded the complete stranger to abandon his expensive toy into Mr Buffaloe 's charge . But he did , and went back to Memphis ; and now when electric trouble occurred in Jefferson , someone had to go by foot or horse or bicycle out to Mr Buffaloe 's home  | on the edge of town , whereupon Mr Buffaloe would appear , vague and dreaming and without haste and still wiping his hands , around the corner of his house from his back yard ; and by the third day Father finally found out where Boon would be ( had been ) during the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ livery stable . Because on that day Boon himself revealed the secret , spilled the beans , with frantic and raging urgency . He and Mr Buffaloe had come to what would have been physical battle , had not Mr Buffaloe  --  that apparently inexhaustible reservoir of surprises and capabilities ? drawn a greasy and soot-grimed but perfectly efficient pistol on Boon . That was how Boon told it . He and Mr Buffaloe had been not merely in complete , but instantaneous , accord and understanding in the whole process of getting the automobile into Mr Buffaloe 's hands and the owner of it out of town ; so that , Boon naturally thought , Mr Buffaloe would quickly solve the mystery of how to operate it and they would slip it out after dark and ride in it . But to Boon 's shocked and outraged amazement , all Mr Buffaloe wanted was to find out why it ran . " He 's ruined it ! " Boon said . " He 's done took it all to pieces just to see what was inside ! He wont never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . He stood , mild and grease-stained and gently dreaming , when two weeks later the owner returned and cranked it up and drove away ; and a year later Buffaloe had made one of his own , engine , gears and all , into a rubber-tired buggy ; that afternoon , stinking noisily and sedately and not at all fast across the Square , he frightened Colonel Sartoris 's matched carriage horses into bolting with the luckily empty surrey and more or less destroying it ; by the next night there was formally recorded into the archives of Jefferson a city  | ordinance against the operation of any mechanically propelled vehicle inside the corporate limits . So , as president of the older , the senior bank in Yoknapatawpha County , my grandfather was forced to buy one or else be dictated to by the president of the junior one . You see what I mean ? not senior and junior in the social hierarchy of the town , least of all rivals in it , but bankers , dedicated priests in the impenetrable and ineluctable mysteries of Finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unyielding opposition to , refusal even to acknowledge , the machine age , Grandfather had been vouchsafed somewhere in the beginning a sort of  --  to him  --  nightmare vision of our nation 's vast and boundless future in which the basic unit of its economy and prosperity would be a small mass-produced cubicle containing four wheels and an engine . So he bought the automobile , and Boon found his soul 's lily maid , the virgin 's love of his rough and innocent heart . It was a Winton Flyer . ( This was the first one he  --  we  --  owned , before the White Steamer which Grandfather traded it for when Grandmother finally decided two years later that she could n't bear the smell of gasoline at all . ) You cranked it by hand while standing in front of it , with no more risk ( provided you had remembered to take it out of gear ) than a bone or two in your forearm ; it had kerosene lamps for night driving and when rain threatened five or six people could readily put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Grandfather himself equipped it with a kerosene lantern , a new axe and a small coil of barbed wire attached to a light block and tackle for driving beyond the town limits . With which equipment it could  --  and did once , of which I shall speak presently  --  go as far as Memphis . Also , all of us , grandparents , parents , aunts , cousins and children , had special costumes for riding in it , consisting of veils ,  | caps , goggles , gauntlet gloves and long shapeless throatclose neutral-colored garments called dusters , of which I shall also speak later . By this time Mr Buffaloe had long since taught Boon to operate his homemade one . They could n't use the streets of Jefferson of course  --  in fact never again did it cross the line of Mr Buffaloe 's front fence  --  but there was an area of open land behind his house which in time Mr Buffaloe and Boon had beaten down and ( relatively ) smoothed into a fair motordrome . So by the time Boon and Mr Wordwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bachelor , one of our most prominent clubmen or men about town ; in ten years he had been a groomsman in thirteen weddings ) , went to Memphis by train and brought the automobile back ( in less than two days this time ; a record ) , Boon was already destined to be the dean of Jefferson motor-car drivers . Then , as far as Boon 's dream was concerned , my grandfather abolished that automobile . He merely bought it , paid what Boon called a sizable chunk of hard valuable cash for it , looked at it thoroughly and inscrutably once and then eliminated it from circulation . He  --  Grandfather ? could n't do that completely of course ; there was that arrogant decree of Colonel Sartoris 's which he  --  Grandfather  --  being the senior , could not permit himself to allow to stand , no matter what his own opinion of motor vehicles was . In fact , in this opinion he and Colonel Sartoris were absolutely eye-to-eye ; until their deaths ( by which time all Yoknapatawpha County 's daytime air was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , filled with the clash of colliding fenders and the squeal of brakes ) neither of them would lend a penny to any man they merely suspected was going to buy an automobile with it . Colonel Sartoris 's crime was simply in having taken the pas of his senior in a move which they both  | approved  --  officially banning automobiles from Jefferson even before they got there . You see ? Grandfather bought the automobile not as a defiance of Colonel Sartoris 's decree . It was simply a calm and deliberately considered abrogation of it , even if only by weekly token . Even before Colonel Sartoris 's decree , Grandfather had had his carriage and horses moved from his back yard to the livery stable , where they were actually more accessible to Grandmother 's telephone call than to her shout from an upstairs back window , because somebody always answered the telephone at the livery stable . Which Ned , in the kitchen or stable or wherever he happened to be ( or was supposed to happen to be when Grandmother wanted him ) , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere in range of any voice from Grandmother 's house since one of them was his wife 's . So now we come to Ned . He was Grandfather 's coachman . His wife ( the one he had then ; he had four ) was Delphine , Grandmother 's cook . At that time he was " Uncle " Ned only to Mother . I mean , she was the one who insisted that all us children  --  three of us , that is , because Alexander could n't call anybody anything yet ? call him Uncle Ned . Nobody else cared whether we did or not , not even Grandmother , who was a McCaslin too , and certainly not Ned himself , who had n't earned it even by just living long enough for the fringe of hair embracing his bald skull to begin to turn gray , let alone white ( it never did . I mean , his hair : turn white nor even gray . When he died at seventy-four , except for having run through four wives he had n't changed at all ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Uncle ; none of these but only Mother , who in the McCaslin sense was not even kin to us , insisted on it . Because he ? Ned  --  was a McCaslin , born in the McCaslin back yard in 186o . He was our family skeleton ; we inherited him in  | turn , with his legend ( which had no firmer supporter than Ned himself ) that his mother had been the natural daughter of old Lucius Quintus Carothers himself and a Negro slave ; never did Ned let any of us forget that he , along with Cousin Isaac , was an actual grandson to old time-honored Lancaster where we moiling Edmondses and Priests , even though three of us  --  you , me and my grandfather  --  were named for him , were mere diminishing connections and hangers-on . So when Boon and Mr Wordwin arrived with the car , the carriage house was all ready for it : new-floored and - doored , with a brand-new padlock already in Grandfather 's hand while he walked slowly around the car , looking at it exactly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the client too for that matter ) on which a would-be patron of the bank was offering to borrow money . Then he motioned Boon to drive it on into the garage ( oh yes , we already knew that was the name of an automobile shed , even in 1904 , even in Mississippi ) . " What ? " Boon said . " Drive it in , " Grandfather said . " You ai nt even going to try it ? " Boon said . " No , " Grandfather said . Boon drove it into the garage and ( just Boon ) came out again . There had been astonishment in his face ; now there was shock , divination , something like terror . " Has it got a key ? " Grandfather said . " What ? " Boon said . " A catch . A pin . A hook . Something you start it with . " Slowly Boon took something from his pocket and put it into Grandfather 's hand . " Shut the doors , " Grandfather said , and himself walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put that key into his pocket also . Now Boon was fighting a battle with himself . He was in crisis ; the matter was desperate . I  --  we , Mr Word-  | win , Grandmother , Ned , Delphine and everybody else white and black who had happened along the street when the automobile came up  --  watched him win it , or that initial engagement of pickets anyway . " I 'll come back after dinner , so Miss Sarah " ( that was Grandmother ) " can try it . About one oclock . I can come sooner if that 'll be too late . " " I 'll send word to the stable , " Grandfather said . Because it was a full-scale action : no mere squabbling of outposts . It was all out , win or lose ; logistics came into it , and terrain ; feint thrust and parry , deception ; but most of all , patience , the long view . It lasted the remaining three days until Saturday . Boon returned to the livery stable ; all that afternoon he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ostensibly , obviously so , revealing nothing ; he even did his work  --  or so they thought , until Father discovered that Boon on his own authority had deputised Luster to meet with the hack the afternoon train whose arrival ( unless it was late ) always coincided with the time , moment when Grandfather left the bank for the day . But although the battle was still a holding action requiring  --  nay , demanding  --  constant alertness and vigilance instead of a drive capable of carrying itself with its own momentum , Boon was still confident , still on top : " Sure . I sent Luster . The way this town is growing , we will need two hacks at them trains any day now , and I been had my eye on Luster for the second driver a good while now . Do n't worry ; I 'm going to watch him . " But no telephone . By six oclock , even Boon admitted that today there would be none . But it was a holding action ; nothing was lost yet , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The next morning about ten he  --  we  --  entered the bank as though by passing afterthought . " Lemme have the keys , " he told Grandfather . " All that Missippi dust and mud , let alone the  | Tennessee mud and dust already under it . I 'll take the hose with me from the stable in case Ned has mislaid yours out of sight somewhere . " Grandfather was looking at Boon , just looking at him with no hurry , like Boon really was the one with the wagon or hay baler offering to borrow fifteen dollars . " I do nt want the inside of the carriage house wet , " Grandfather said . But Boon matched him , as detached and even more indifferent , with even more time to spare , use . " Sure , sure . Remember , the man said the engine ought to be run every day . Not to go nowhere : just to keep the spark plugs and magneto from rusting and costing you twenty , twenty-five dollars for a new one all the way from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the factory . I do nt blame you ; all I know is what he told you ; I 'd just have to take his word too . But then you can afford it . You own the automobile ; if you want to rust it up , it ai nt nobody else 's business . A horse would a been different . Even if you had n't even paid a hundred dollars for a horse you 'd a had me out there at daylight lunging him on a rope just to keep his guts working . " Because Grandfather was a good banker and Boon knew it : that Grandfather not only knew when to foreclose , but when to compound and cancel too . He reached into his pocket and handed Boon the two keys  --  the one to the padlock and the thing that turned the automobile on . " Come on , " Boon told me , already turning . While we were still up the street we could already hear Grandmother hollering for Ned from the upstairs back window , though by the time we reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back yard to get the hose , Delphine came out the kitchen door . " Where is Ned ? " she said . " We been hollering for him all morning . Is he up there at the livery stable ? " " Sure , " Boon said . " I 'll tell him too . Just do nt expect  | him neither . " Ned was there . He and two of my brothers were like a row of stairsteps trying to see through the cracks in the garage door . I reckon Alexander would have been there too except he could n't walk yet ; I do nt know why Aunt Callie had n't thought of it yet . Then Alexander was there ; Mother came across the street from our house carrying him . So maybe Aunt Callie was still washing diapers . " Morning , Miss Alison , " Boon said . " Morning , Miss Sarah , " he said , because now Grandmother was there too , with Delphine behind her . And now there were two more ladies , neighbors , still in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor even a very good trader either . But he was proving to be a pretty damned good guerrilla fighter . He went and unlocked the garage door and opened it . Ned was the first one inside . " Well , " Boon said to him , " you been here ever since daylight to peep at it through that crack . What do you think about it ? " " I do nt think nothing about it , " Ned said . " Boss Priest could a bought the best two-hundred-dollar horse in Yoknapatawpha County for this money . " " There ai nt any two-hundred-dollar horse in Yoknapatawpha County , " Boon said . " If there was , this automobile would buy ten of them . Go be hooking up that hose . " " Go be hooking up that hose , Lucius , " Ned said to me ; he did n't even look around . He went to the automobile door and opened it . It was the back seat . Front seats did n't have doors in those days ; you just walked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you and Miss Alison , " Ned said . " Delphine can wait with the children for the next trip . " " You go hook up that hose like I told you , " Boon said . " I got to get it out of here before I can do anything to it . " " You ai nt gonter tote it out in your hand , is you ? "  | Ned said . " I reckon we can ride that far . I reckon I 'm gonter have to drive it so the sooner I starts , the quicker it will be . " He said : " Hee hee hee . " He said : " Come on , Miss Sarah . " " Will it be all right , Boon ? " Grandmother said . " Yessum , Miss Sarah , " Boon said . Grandmother and Mother got in . Before Boon could close the door , Ned was already in the front seat . " Get out of there , " Boon said . " Go ahead and tend to your business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ai nt gonter touch nothing until I learns how , and just setting here ai nt gonter learn me . Go on and hook up , or whatever you does to it . " Boon went around to the driver 's side and set the switches and levers , and went to the front and jerked the crank . On the third pull , the engine roared . " Boon ! " Grandmother cried . " It 's all right , Miss Sarah ! " Boon hollered above the noise , running back to the guiding wheel . " I do n't care ! " Grandmother said . " Get in quick ! I 'm nervous ! " Boon got in and quieted the engine and shifted the levers ; a moment , then the automobile moved quietly and slowly backward out of the shed , into the lot , the sunshine , and stopped . " Hee hee hee , " Ned said . " Be careful , Boon , " Grandmother said . I could see her hand gripping the stanchion of the top . " Yessum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backward , beginning to turn . Then it moved forward , still turning ; Grandmother 's hand still gripped the stanchion . Mother 's face looked like a girl 's . The car went slowly and quietly across the lot until it was facing the gate to the lane , to the outside , to the world , and stopped . And Boon did n't say anything : he just sat there behind the wheel , the engine running smooth and quiet , his head  | turned just enough for Grandmother to see his face . Oh yes , maybe he was n't a negotiable-paper wizard like Grandfather , and there were folks in Jefferson that would say he was n't much of anything else either , but for this skirmish anyway he was a skirmish fighter of consummate skill and grace . Grandmother sat for maybe a half a minute . Then she drew a long breath and expelled it . " No , " she said . " We must wait for Mister Priest . " Maybe it was n't a victory , but anyway our side  --  Boonhad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Grandfather 's ) front , by suppertime that night the enemy himself would discover it too . Discover in fact that his flank had been turned . The next afternoon ( Saturday ) after the bank closed , and each succeeding Saturday afternoon , and then when summer came , every afternoon except when rain was actually falling , Grandfather in front beside Boon and the rest of us in rotation  --  Grandmother , Mother , me and my three brothers and Aunt Callie that nursed us in turn , including Father , and Delphine and our various connections and neighbors and Grandmother 's close friends in their ordered rote  --  in the linen dusters and goggles , would drive through Jefferson and the adjacent countryside ; Aunt Callie and Delphine in their turns , but not Ned . He rode in it once : that one minute while it backed slowly out of the garage , and the two minutes while it turned and moved slowly forward across the lot until Grandmother lost her nerve and said No to the open gate and the public world , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted  --  anyway become convinced  --  that even if Grandfather had ever intended to make him the official operator and custodian of the automobile , he could have approached it only over Boon 's dead body . But although he declined to recognise that the automobile existed on the place , he and Grand-  | father had met on some unspoken gentlemen 's ground regarding it : Ned never to speak in scorn or derogation of its ownership and presence , Grandfather never to order Ned to wash and polish it as he used to do the carriage  --  which Grandfather and Ned both knew Ned would have refused to do , even if Boon had let him : by which Grandfather visited on Ned his only punishment for his apostasy : he refused to give Ned the public chance to refuse to wash the automobile before Boon might have had a public chance to refuse to let him do it . Because that was when Boon transferred  --  was transferred by mutual and instantaneous consent  --  from the day shift at the stable to the night shift . Otherwise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That part of our Jefferson leisure class , friends or acquaintances of Father 's or maybe just friends of horses , who could have used the stable as a permanent business address  --  if they had had any business or expected any mail ? were less strangers there than Boon . If  --  when  --  you , meaning Father , wanted Boon now , you sent me to Grandfather 's lot , where he would be washing and polishing the automobile  --  this , even during those first weeks when it had not left the lot since last Saturday and would not leave it again until the next one , backing it out of the shed and washing it again each morning , with tender absorption , right down to the last spoke and nut , then sitting guard over it while it dried . " He 's going to soak all the paint off of it , " Mr Ballott said . " Does Boss know he 's running the hose on that automobile four or five hours every day ? " " What if he did ? " Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot all day looking at it . " " Put him on the night shift , " Mr Ballott said . " Then he could do whatever he wants to with his daylight and John  | Powell could go home and sleep in a bed every night for a change . " " I already have , " Father said . " As soon as I can find somebody to go to that lot and tell him . " There was a shuck mattress in the harness room on which until now John Powell or one of the other drivers or hostlers under his command always spent the night , mainly as night watchmen against fire . Now Father installed a cot and mattress in the office itself , where Boon could get some sleep , which he needed , since now he could spend all day with complete immunity in Grandfather 's lot either washing the automobile or just looking at it . So now every afternoon , as many of us as the back seat would hold in our ordered turns would drive through the Square and into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be as much and inseparable a part of the automobile 's equipment as the engine which moved it . But always through the Square first . You would have thought that as soon as he bought the automobile , Grandfather would have done what you would have done , having bought the automobile for that end : lain in wait for Colonel Sartoris and his carriage and ambushed , bushwhacked him and really taught him how to pass ordinances restricting others ' rights and privileges without consulting his betters first . But Grandfather did n't do this . We finally realised that he was n't interested in Colonel Sartoris : he was interested in teams , vehicles . Because I told you he was a far-sighted man , a man capable of vision : Grandmother sitting tense and rigid and gripping the top stanchion and not even calling Grandfather Mister Priest now , as she had done as long as we had known her , but calling him by his given name as though she were no kin to him , the horse or team we  | were approaching reined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandmother saying , " Lucius ! Lucius ! " and Grandfather ( if a man was driving and there were no women or children in the buggy or wagon ) saying quietly to Boon : " Do nt stop . Keep going . But slow now . " Or , when a woman had the lines , telling Boon to stop and himself getting out , talking quietly and steadily to the spooked horse until he could get hold of the bit and lead the vehicle past and remove his hat to the ladies in the buggy and come back and get back into the front seat and only then answer Grandmother : " We must get them used to it . Who knows ? there may be another automobile in Jefferson in the next ten or fifteen years . " In fact , that homemade dream which Mr Buffaloe had created single-handed in his back yard two years ago came within an ace of curing Grandfather of a habit which he had had since he was nineteen years old . He chewed tobacco . The first time he turned his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the back seat did n't know what was going to happen until it was already too late . Because how could we ? None of us had ever ridden in an automobile before farther than ( this was the first trip ) from the carriage house to the lot gate , let alone one going fifteen miles an hour ( and this was something else : when we were going ten miles an hour Boon always said we were doing twenty ; at twenty , he always said forty ; we discovered a straight stretch about a half a mile long a few miles out of town where the automobile would get up to twenty-five , where I heard him tell a group of men on the Square that the automobile made sixty miles an hour ; this was before he knew that we knew that the thing on the dashboard which looked like a steam gauge was a speedometer ) , so how could we be expected to ? Besides , it did n't make  | any difference to the rest of us ; we all had our goggles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new , the spots and splashes were just brown spots and splashes and just because they were called dusters was no reason why they should not be called on to face anything else but dust . Maybe it was because Grandmother was sitting on the left side ( in those days automobiles operated from the right side , like buggies ; even Henry Ford , a man as long-visioned as Grandfather , had not yet divined that the steering wheel would be on the left ) directly behind Grandfather . She said at once to Boon : " Stop the automobile , " and sat there , not mad so much as coldly and implacably outraged and shocked . She was just past fifty then ( she was fifteen when she and Grandfather married ) and in all those fifty years she had no more believed that a man , let alone her husband , would spit in her face than she could have believed that Boon for instance would approach a curve in the road without tooting the horn . She said , to nobody ; she did n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take me home . " " Now , Sarah , " Grandfather said . " Now , Sarah . " He threw the chew away and took out the clean handkerchief from his other pocket , but Grandmother would n't even take it . Boon had already started to get out and go to a house we could see and get a pan of water and soap and a towel , but Grandmother would n't have that either . " Do nt touch me , " she said . " Drive on . " So we went on , Grandmother with the long drying brown splash across one of her goggles and down her cheek even though Mother kept on offering to spit on her handkerchief and wipe it off . " Let me alone , Alison , " Grandmother said . But not Mother . She did n't mind tobacco , not in the car . Maybe that was why . But more and more that sum-  | mer it would be just Mother and us and Aunt Callie and one or two neighbor children in the back seat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl 's . Because she had invented a kind of shield on a handle like a big fan , light enough for her to raise in front of us almost as fast as Grandfather could turn his head . So he could chew now , Mother always alert and ready with the screen ; all of us were quick now in fact , so that almost before the instant when Grandfather knew he was going to turn his head to the left to spit , the screen had already come up and all of us in the back seat had leaned to the right like we were on the same wire , actually doing twenty and twenty-five miles an hour now because there were already two more automobiles in Jefferson that summer ; it was as though the automobiles themselves were beating the roads smooth long before the money they represented would begin to compel smoother roads . " Twenty-five years from now there wont be a road in the county you cant drive an automobile on in any weather , " Grandfather said . " Wont that cost a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It will cost a great deal of money , " Grandfather said . " The road builders will issue bonds . The bank will buy them . " " Our bank ? " Mother said . " Buy bonds for automo-biles ? " " Yes , " Grandfather said . " We will buy them . " " But what about us ? ? I mean , Maury . " " He will still be in the livery business , " Grandfather said . " He will just have a new name for it . Priest 's Garage maybe , or the Priest Motor Company . People will pay any price for motion . They will even work for it . Look at bicycles . Look at Boon . We do nt know why . " Then the next May came and my other grandfather , Mother 's father , died in Bay St Louis .  | It was Saturday again . The next one in fact ; Ludus was going to start getting paid again every Saturday night ; maybe he had even stopped borrowing mules . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Square with the freight bills and my canvas sack to carry the money in , just finishing in the Farmers Supply when Boon came in , fast , too quick for him . I should have suspected at once . No , I should have known at once , having known Boon all my life , let alone having watched him for a year now with that automobile . He was already reaching for the money sack , taking it right out of my hand before I could even close my fist . " Leave it , " he said . " Come on . " " Here , " I said . " I 've barely started . " " I said leave it . Shake it up . Hurry . They 've got to  | make Twenty-three , " he said , already turning . He had completely ignored the unpaid freight bills themselves . They were just paper ; the railroad company had plenty more of them . But the sack contained money . " Who 's got to make Twenty-three ? " I said . Number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson had passenger trains then , enough of them so they had to number them to keep them separate . " Goddammit , " Boon said , " how can I break it gentle to you when you wont even listen ? Your grandpa died last night . We got to hurry . " " He did n't ! " I said , cried . " He was on the front gallery this morning when we passed . " He was . Father and I both saw him , either reading the paper or just standing or sitting there like he was every morning , waiting for time to go to the bank . " Who the hell 's talking about Boss ? " Boon said . " I said your other grandpa , your ma 's papa down there at Jackson or Mobile or wherever it is . " " Oh , " I said . " Do nt you even know the difference between Bay St. Louis and Mobile ? " Because it was all right now . This was different . Bay St. Louis was three hundred miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Jefferson and three times we went down there in the summer . Also , he had been sick a long time ; we  --  Mother and us  --  had been there last summer actually to see him enter what was to be his last bed even if we did n't know it then ( Mother and Aunt Callie , because your Great-uncle Alexander had arrived a month before , had been down last winter when they thought he was going to die ) . I say " if , " meaning Mother ; to a child , when an old person becomes sick he or she has already quitted living ; the actual death merely clears the atmosphere so to speak , incapable of removing anything which was already gone .  | " All right , all right , " Boon said . " Just come on . Jackson , Mobile , New Orleans  --  all I know is , it 's down that way somewhere , and wherever it is , they still got to catch that train . " And that  --  the name New Orleans , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have told me all , revealed the whole of Boon 's outrageous dream , intent , determination ; his later elaborate machinations to seduce me to it should merely have corroborated . But maybe I was still recovering from shock ; also , at that moment I did n't have as many facts as Boon did . So we just went on , fast , I trotting to keep up , the shortest way across the Square , until we reached home . Where was much commotion . It was barely two hours until the train and Mother was far too busy to take time to mourn or grieve : merely pale-faced , intent , efficient . Because I now learned what Boon had already told me twice : that Grandfather and Grandmother were going to bury Grandfather Lessep also . He and Grandfather had been roommates , in the same class at the University ; they had been groomsmen in each other 's wedding , which possibly had a little something to do with why Mother and Father chose one another out of all the earth to look into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady ) , and Grandmother and Grandmother Lessep lived far enough apart to continue to be civil and even pleasant to the other mother of an only child . Besides that , people took funerals seriously in those days . Not death : death was our constant familiar : no family but whose annals were dotted with headstones whose memorialees had been too brief in tenure to bear a name even  --  unless of course the mother slept there too in that one grave , which happened more often than you would like to think . Not to mention the husbands and uncles and aunts in the twenties and thirties and forties , and the grandparents and childless great-uncles and - aunts  | who died at home then , in the same rooms and beds they were born in , instead of in cubicled euphemisms with names pertaining to sunset . But the funerals , the ritual ceremonial of interment , with tenuous yet steel-strong threads capable of extending even further and bearing even more weight than the distance between Jefferson and the Gull of Mexico . So Grandfather and Grandmother were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , lacking any other close kinfolks in town , we  --  me and my three brothers and Aunt Callie  --  would have to be sent out to Cousin Zachary Edmonds 's farm seventeen miles away to stay until Father and Mother got back ; it meant only incidentally that Father and Mother would be gone four days . What it actually meant was that Grandfather and Grandmother would not even come back after four days . Because Grandfather never left Jefferson at all , even to go only to Memphis , without spending two or three days in New Orleans , which he loved , either going or coming ; and this time they might quite possibly take Mother and Father with them . It meant in fact what Boon had already told me twice by exuberant and still unbelieving inadvertence : that the owner of that automobile , and everyone else having or even assuming authority over it , would be three hundred miles from it for anywhere from four days to a week . So all his clumsy machinations to seduce and corrupt me were only corroboration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taken the car alone , and doubtless would if I had been incorruptible , even knowing that someday he must bring it back or come back himself in order to face lesser music than he would if  --  when  --  Grandfather 's police caught up with him . Because come back he must . Where else could he go , who knew nowhere else , to whom the words , names  --  Jefferson , McCaslin , De Spain ,  | Compson  --  were not just home but father and mother both ? But some frayed ragtag judgment , some embryo gleam of simple yet-virgin discretion and common sense , persuaded him at least to try me first , to have me by as a kind of hostage . And he did n't need to try , test me first . When grown people speak of the innocence of children , they do nt really know what they mean . Pressed , they will go a step further and say , Well , ignorance then . The child is neither . There is no crime which a boy of eleven had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may not yet be old enough to desire the fruits of it , which is not innocence but appetite ; his ignorance is , he does not know how to commit it , which is not ignorance but size . But Boon did n't know this . He must seduce me . And he had so little time : only from the time the train left until dark . He could have started cold , from scratch , tomorrow or next day or any day up to and including Wednesday . But today , now , was his best , with the car visible to all Jefferson , already in motion , already involved in the condition of departure ; it was as if the gods themselves had offered him these scot-free hours between eleven-two and sunset , he to scorn , ignore them at his peril . The car came up , Grandfather and Grandmother already in it , with the shoebox of fried chicken and devilled eggs and cake for dinner since there would n't be a dining car until they changed to the Limited at the junction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Father well enough by this time to know they were not going to wait until one oclock to eat dinner , no matter who was dead . No : Grandmother too , if the bereaved had been anybody but Mother . No , that 's wrong too ; Grandmother had a wider range than her son 's wife ; maybe all Mother would have needed was to be a female . It 's not men  | who cope with death ; they resist , try to fight back and get their brains trampled out in consequence ; where women just flank it , envelop it in one soft and instantaneous confederation of unresistance like cotton batting or cobwebs , already de-stingered and harmless , not merely reduced to size and usable but even useful like a penniless bachelor or spinster connection always available to fill an empty space or conduct an extra guest down to dinner . Their grips were already tied onto the fenders and Son Thomas had already brought Mother 's and Father 's out to the street and now we all followed , Mother in her black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following with Aunt Callie carrying Alexander . " Goodbye , " Mother said , " good-bye , " kissing us veil and all , smelling like she always did but with something black in the smell too , like the thin black veil which really hid nothing , as if more than just a mechanical electric message over the copper wire had come that three hundred miles up from Bay St Louis ; oh yes , I could smell it when she kissed me , saying , " You 're the big boy , the man now . You must help Aunt Callie with the others , so they wont worry Cousin Louisa , " already getting quick into the automobile beside Grandmother , when Boon said , " I 'll have to fill the tank for the trip out to McCaslin after dinner . I thought Lucius could come along now and help me on the way back from the depot . " You see , how easy it was going to be . It was too easy , making you a little ashamed . It was as if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Grandmother and Mother and Father . All right then : against me too . Even the fact that automobiles were only two or three years old in Jefferson abetted Boon  --  all right , us . Mr Rouncewell , the oil company agent who supplied all the stores in Yoknapatawpha County from  | his tanks on the side track at the depot , for the last two years had also had a special tank of gasoline , with a pump and a Negro to pump it ; all Boon or anyone else who wanted gasoline had to do was , simply drive up and stop and get out and the Negro would lift off the front seat and measure the tank with his special notched stick and fill the tank and collect the money or ( if Mr Rouncewell himself was n't there ) let you yourself write down your name and how many gallons in a greasy ledger . But , although Grandfather had owned the car almost a year now , not one of them  --  Grandfather or Grandmother or Father or Mother  --  had either the knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was just the curiosity ) to question or challenge Boon . So he and I stood on the platform ; Mother waved to us through the window as the train drew away . Now it was his move . He would have to say something , have to begin . He had managed to get the decks cleared and me in his power , at least until Aunt Callie began to wonder where I was to eat my dinner . I mean , Boon did n't know he did n't have to say anything , other than perhaps to tell me where we were going , and even that  --  the destination ? did n't matter . He had learned nothing since about human beings , and apparently had even forgot what he once must have known about boys . And now Boon himself did n't know how to begin . He had prayed for luck , and immediately , by return post you might say , had been vouchsafed more than he knew what to do with . They have told you before this probably that Fortune is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good or bad : more of the former than you ever believe ( perhaps with justice ) that you deserve ; more of the latter than you can handle . So with Boon . So all he said was , " Well . " Nor did I help him ; I took that revenge . All right ,  | revenge on whom ? Not on Boon of course : on me , my shame ; perhaps on Father and Mother , who had abandoned me to the shame ; perhaps on Grandfather , whose automobile had made the shame available ; who knows ? perhaps on Mr Buffaloe himself  --  that rapt and divinely stricken somnambulist who had started the whole thing two innocent years ago . But I did feel sorry for Boon because he had so little time . It was after eleven now ; Aunt Callie would be expecting me back in a matter of minutes , not because she knew it could n't take more than ten minutes to get back home after she heard Twentythree whistle for the lower crossing , but because she would already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on the way to McCaslin ; she had been born in the country and still preferred it . Boon was n't looking at me . He very carefully was n't looking at me . " Three hundred miles , " he said . " Good thing somebody invented trains . If they 'd a had to go by mule wagon like folks used to , they could n't even get there in ten days , let alone back in ten days too . " " Father said four days , " I said . " That 's right , " Boon said . " So he did . Maybe we got four days to get back to the house in , but that still do nt give us forever . " We went back to the car and got in it . But he did n't start it . " Maybe when Boss gets back in te ? four days he 'll let me learn you to run this thing . You 're big enough . Besides , you already know how . Have you ever thought about that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ai nt going to let me . " " Well , you do nt need to rush at it . You got four days for him to change his mind in . Though my guess is nearer ten . " Still he did n't move to start the car . " Ten days , " he said . " How far do you reckon this automobile could travel in ten days ? " " Father said four , " I said .  | " All right , " he said . " How far in four days ? " " I ai nt going to know that either , " I said . " Because ai nt anybody around here going to find out to tell me " " All right , " he said . He started the car suddenly and backed and turned it , already going fast , neither toward the Square nor toward Mr Rouncewell 's gasoline pump . " I thought we had to get gasoline , " I said . We were going fast . " I changed my mind , " Boon said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave for McCaslin after dinner . Then so much of it wont evaporate away just standing around . " We were in a lane now , going fast between Negro cabins and vegetable patches and chicken yards , with chickens and mongrel dogs leaping frantically from the dust just in time , out of the lane and into a vacant field , a waste place marked faintly with tire tracks but no hooves ; and now I recognised it : Mr Buffaloe 's homemade motordrome where Colonel Sartoris 's law had driven him two years ago and where he had taught Boon to operate an automobile . And still I did n't understand until Boon wrenched the car to a stop and said , " Move over here . " So I was late for dinner after all ; Aunt Callie was already standing on the front gallery , carrying Alexander and already yelling at Boon and me even before he stopped the car to let me out . Because Boon licked me in fair battle after all ; evidently he had n't quite forgot all he remembered from his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I even knew better then : that Boon 's fall and mine were not only instantaneous but simultaneous too : back at the identical instant when Mother got the message that Grandfather Lessep was dead . But that 's what I would have liked to believe : that Boon simply licked me . Anyway , that 's what I told myself at the time : that , secure behind that inviolable and inescapable rectitude concomitant with the name I bore ,  | patterned on the knightly shapes of my male ancestors as bequeathed  --  nay , compelled  --  to me by my father 's word-of-mouth , further bolstered and made vulnerable to shame by my mother 's doting conviction , I had been merely testing Boon ; not trying my own virtue but simply testing Boon 's capacity to undermine it ; and , in my innocence , trusting too much in the armor and shield of innocence ; expected , demanded , assumed more than that frail Milanese was capable of withstanding . I say " frail Milanese " not advisedly but explicitly : having noticed in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of virtue evidently have grave doubts of their own regarding the impregnability of virtue as a shield , putting their faith and trust not in virtue but rather in the god or goddess whose charge virtue is ; by-passing virtue as it were in allegiance to the Overgoddess herself , in return for which the goddess will either divert temptation away or anyhow intercede between them . Which explains a lot , having likewise noticed in my time that the goddess in charge of virtue seems to be the same one in charge of luck , if not of folly also . So Boon beat me in fair battle , using , as a gentleman should and would , gloves . When he stopped the car and said , " Move over , " I thought I knew what he intended . We had done this before at four or five convenient and discreet times in Grandfather 's lot , me sitting on Boon 's lap holding the wheel and steering while he let the automobile move slowly in low gear across the lot . So I was ready for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counterthrust , opening my mouth to say It 's too hot to sit on anybody today . Besides we better get on back on home when I saw that he was already out of the car on his side while he was still speaking , standing there with one hand on the wheel and the engine still running . For another second or two I still could n't be-  | lieve it . " Hurry up , " he said . " Any minute now Callie will come running out of that lane toting that baby under one arm and already yelling . " So I moved under the wheel , and with Boon beside me , over me , across me , one hand on mine to shift the gears , one hand on mine to regulate the throttle , we moved back and forth across that vacant sun-glared waste , forward a while , backward a while , intent , timeless , Boon as much as I , immersed , rapt , steadying me ( he was playing for such stakes , you see ) , out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courthouse clock striking noon a half-mile away restored us , hurled us back into the impending hard world of finagle and deception . " All right , " Boon said , " quick , " not even waiting but lifting me bodily across him as he slid under the wheel , the car already rushing back across the field toward home , we talking man-to-man now , mutual in crime , confederate of course but not coeval yet because of my innocence ; I already beginning to say What do I do now ? You 'll have to tell me when once again Boon spoke first and made us equal too : " Have you figgered how to do it ? We ai nt got much time . " " All right , " I said . " Go on . Get on back to the house before Aunt Callie starts hollering . " So you see what I mean about Virtue ? You have heard  --  or anyway you will ? people talk about evil times or an evil generation . There are no such things . No epoch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is or will be big enough to hold the un-virtue of any given moment , any more than they could contain all the air of any given moment ; all they can do is hope to be as little soiled as possible during their passage through it . Because what pity that Virtue does not  --  possibly can not  --  take care of its own as Non-virtue does . Probably it can not : who to the dedicated to Virtue , offer in reward only cold and  | odorless and tasteless virtue : as compared not only to the bright rewards of sin and pleasure but to the ever watchful unflagging omniprescient skill  --  that incredible matchless capacity for invention and imagination  --  with which even the tottering footsteps of infancy are steadily and firmly guided into the primrose path . Because oh yes , I had matured terrifyingly since that clock struck two minutes ago . It has been my observation that , except in a few scattered cases of what might be called malevolent hyper-prematurity , children , like poets , lie rather for pleasure than profit . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few negligible exceptions involving simple self-defense against creatures ( my parents ) bigger and stronger than me . But not any more . Or anyway , not now . I was as bent as Boon , and  --  during the next step anyway  --  even more culpable . Because ( I realised ; no : knew ; it was obvious ; Boon himself admitted it in so many words ) I was smarter than Boon . I realised , felt suddenly that same exultant fever-flash which Faustus himself must have experienced : that of we two doomed and irrevocable , I was the leader , I was the boss , the master . Aunt Callie was already standing on the front gallery , carrying Alexander and yelling . " Dry up , " I said . " Ai nt dinner ready ? The automobile broke down . Boon fixed it . We never had time to get the gasoline and now I have to eat in a hurry and go back and help him fill the tank . " I went back to the dining room . Dinner was already on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Callie had already dressed them ( she had dressed them to go seventeen miles out to Cousin Zack 's to spend four days as if they were going to Memphis ; I do nt know why , unless it was because she did n't have anything else to do between the time Mother and Father left and dinner . Because  | Maury and Alexander would both have to take a nap before we could leave ) but by the front of his blouse , she would have to wash Maury off and dress him again . Even then , I finished before they did and went back ( Aunt Callie was still yelling , not loud in the house of course . But what could she do , single-handed  --  and a Negro  --  against Non-virtue ? ) across the street to Grandfather 's . Ned had probably left for town as soon as the automobile drove off . But he would probably come back for his dinner . He had . We stood in the back yard . He blinked at me . Quite often , most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a fox 's . " Why do nt you aim to stay out there ? " he said . " I promised some fellows we would slip off tomorrow and try a new fishing hole one of them knows about . " Ned blinked at me . " So you aims to ride out to McCaslin with Boon Hogganbeck and then turn right around and come back with him . Only you got to have something to tell Miss Louisa so she 'll let you come back and so you needs me to front for you . " " No , " I said . " I do nt need anything from you . I 'm just telling you so you 'll know where I am and they wont blame you . I ai nt even going to bother you . I 'm going to stay with Cousin Ike . " Before the rest of them came , I mean my brothers , when Mother and Father were out late at night and Grandfather and Grandmother were gone too , I used to stay with Ned and Delphine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just for fun . I could have done that now , if it would have worked . But Cousin Ike lived alone in a single room over his hardware store . Even if Ned ( or somebody else concerned ) asked him point-blank if I was with him Saturday night , it would be at least Monday by then , and I had already decided quick and hard not to think about Monday . You see , if only people did n't refuse quick and  | hard to think about next Monday , Virtue would n't have such a hard and thankless time of it . " I see , " Ned said . " You ai nt needing nothing from me . You just being big-hearted to save me bother and worry over you . Save everybody bother and worry that comes around wanting to know why you ai nt out at McCaslin where your paw told you to be . " He blinked at me . " Hee hee hee , " he said . " All right , " I said . " Tell Father I went fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care . " " I ai nt fixing to tell nobody nothing about you , " he said . " You ai nt none of my business . You 's Callie 's business unto your maw gets back . Unlessen you gonter transfer to Mr Ike 's business for tonight , like you said . " He blinked at me . " When is Boon Hogganbeck coming for yawl ? " " Pretty soon now , " I said . " And you better not let Father or Boss hear you calling him Boon Hogganbeck . " " I calls him Mister in plenty of time for him to earn it , " Ned said . " Let alone deserve it . " He said , " Hee hee hee . " You see ? I was doing the best I could . My trouble was , the tools I had to use . The innocence and the ignorance : I not only did n't have strength and knowledge , I did n't even have time enough . When the fates , gods  --  all right , Non-virtue  --  give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . But at least Cousin Ike was easy to find on Saturday . " You bet , " he said . " Come and stay with me tonight . Maybe we 'll go fishing tomorrow  --  just do nt tell your father . " " No sir , " I said . " Not stay with you tonight . I 'm going to stay with Ned and Delphine , like I always do . I just wanted you to know , since Mother 's not here where I can tell her . I mean , ask her . " You see : doing the best I could with what I had , knew . Not that I was losing faith  | , 1 a 11 in ultimate success : it simply seemed to me that Nonvirtue was wasting in merely testing me that time which was urgent and even desperate for greater ends . I went back home , not running : Jefferson must not see me running ; but as fast as I could without it . You see , I did not dare trust Boon unbacked in Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , it was Boon and the automobile who were late . Aunt Callie even had Maury and Alexander re-dressed again ; if they had had naps since dinner , it was the shortest fastest sleep on record in our house . Also , Ned was there , where he had no business being . No , that 's not right . I mean , his being there was completely wrong : not being at our house , he was often there , but being anywhere where he could be doing something useful with Grandfather and Grandmother out of town . Because he was carrying the baggage out ? the wicker basket of Alexander 's diapers and other personal odds and ends , the grips containing mine and Lessep 's and Maury 's clothes for four days , and Aunt Callie 's cloth-wrapped bundle , lumping them without order at the gate and telling Aunt Callie : " You might just as well set down and rest your feet . Boon Hogganbeck 's done broke that thing and is somewhere trying to fix it . If you really wants to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stable to send Son Thomas with the carriage and I 'll drive you out there like folks ought to travel " And after a while it began to look like Ned was right . Half past one came ( which time Alexander and Maury could have spent sleeping ) and no Boon ; then Maury and Alexander could have slept another half an hour on top of that ; Ned had said " I tole you so " so many times by now that Aunt Callie had quit yelling about Boon and yelled at Ned himself until he went and sat in the scuppernong arbor ; she was just about to send me to look  | for Boon and the automobile when he drove up . When I saw him , I was terrified . He had changed his clothes . I mean , he had shaved and he had on not merely a white shirt but a clean one , with a collar and necktie ; without doubt when he got out of the car to load us in he would have a coat over his arm and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car would be his grip on the floor . Horror , but rage too ( not at Boon : I discovered , realised that at once ) at myself , who should have known , anticipated this , having known ( I realised this too now ) all my life that who dealt with Boon dealt with a child and had not merely to cope with but even anticipate its unpredictable vagaries ; not the folly of Boon 's lack of the simplest rudiments of common sense , but the shame of my failure to anticipate , assume he would lack them , saying , crying to Whoever it is you indict in such crises Do n't You realise I ai nt but eleven years old ? How do You expect me to do all this at just eleven years old ? Do nt You see You are putting on me more than I can handle ? But in the next second , rage at Boon too : not that his stupidity had now wrecked for good our motor trip to Memphis ( that 's right , Memphis as our destination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boon and me . Why should it have been ? Where else did we have to go ? Indeed , where else could anyone in north Mississippi want to go ? Some aged and finished creature on his or her deathbed might contemplate or fear a more distant destination , but they were not Boon and me ) . In fact , at this moment I wished I had never heard of Memphis or Boon or automobiles either ; I was on Colonel Sartoris 's side now , to have abolished Mr Buffaloe and his dream both from the face of the earth at the instant of its inception . My rage at Boon was for having destroyed , cast down with that one childish blow like the blind kick of an infant 's foot , the  | precarious and frantic ramshackle of my lies and false promises and false swearing ; revealing the clay-footed sham for which I had bartered  --  nay , damned  --  my soul ; that , or maybe the exposing of the true shoddy worthlessness of the soul I had been vain enough to assume the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through some shabby inattentive mischance , such as not watching where you were going , innocent even of pleasure , let alone of sin . Then even the rage was gone . Nothing remained , nothing . I did n't want to go anywhere , be anywhere . I mean , I did n't want to be is anywhere . If I had to be something , I wanted it to be was . I said , and I believed it ( I know I believed it because I have said it a thousand times since and I still believe it and I hope to say it a thousand times more in my life and I defy anyone to say I will not believe it ) I will never lie again . It 's too much trouble . It 's too much like trying to prop a feather upright in a saucer of sand . There 's never any end to it . You never get any rest . You 're never finished . You never even use up the sand so that you can quit trying . Only , nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ned was already loading our grips and baskets and bundles into the car . He said grimly : " Hee hee hee . " He said , " Come on , get started so you can break down and still have time to fix it and get back to town before dark . " So he was talking to Boon now . He said , " Are you coming back to town before you leaves ? " Then Boon said : " Leave for where ? " " Leave to eat supper , " Ned said . " Where does anybody with good sense leave to do at sundown ? " " Oh , " Boon said . " You worry about your supper . That 's the only supper you got to worry about eating . " We got in and started , me in front with Boon and the rest of them in the back . We crossed the Square  | crowded with Saturday afternoon , and then we were out of town . But there we were . I mean , we were no forrader . We would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Cousin Zack 's , and we would even be going in the wrong direction . And even if it had been the right direction , we still would not be free ; as long as we still had Aunt Callie and Lessep and Maury and Alexander in the back seat , we were only free of Ned being where nobody in the world had expected him to be , saying Hee hee hee and Are you coming back to town before . Boon had never once looked at me , nor I at him . Nor had he spoken to me either ; possibly he sensed that he had frightened me with his clean shirt and collar and necktie and the shave in the middle of the day and all the rest of the give-away aura of travel , departure , separation , severance ; sensed that I was not only frightened but angry that I had been vulnerable to fright ; going on , the sunny early afternoon road stretching on ahead for the seventeen miles during which something would have to be decided , agreed upon ; on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coiling behind us unless we had to slow down for a bridge or a sandy stretch which required the low gears ; the seventeen miles which would not last forever even though there were seventeen of them , the mileposts diminishing much too rapidly while something had to be done , decided sooner and sooner and nearer and nearer and I did n't know what yet ; or maybe just something said , a voice , noise , a human sound , since no matter what bitter forfeit Nonvirtue may afterward wrench and wring from you , loneliness , solitude , silence should not be part of it . But at least Boon tried . Or maybe with him it was just the silence too and any un-silence were better , no matter how foolish nor long-ago pre-doomed . No , it was more than  | that ; we had less than half the distance left now and something had to be done , started , fused-off : " The roads are sure fine now , everywhere , even further than Yoknapatawpha County . A man could n't want better roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than they are now . How far do you reckon this car could go between now and sundown ? " You see ? 11 addressed to nobody , like the drowning man thrusting one desperate hand above the surface hoping there might be a straw there . He found none : " I do nt know , " Aunt Callie said from the back seat , holding Alexander , who had been asleep since we left town and did n't deserve a car ride of one mile , let alone seventeen . " And you ai nt gonter know neither , unlessen you studies it out setting in that front seat locked up in that shed in Boss 's back yard tonight . " Now we were almost there . " So you want ? " Boon said , out of the side of his mouth , just exactly loud enough for me to hear , aimed exactly at my right ear like a gun or an arrow or maybe a handful of sand at a closed window . " Shut up , " I said , exactly like him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly to stop and as he did so , leap from the car , already running , presenting to Aunt Callie the split-second alternative either to abandon Alexander to Boon and try to run me down in the bushes , or stick with Alexander and pursue me with simple yelling . I mean , have Boon drive on and leave them at the house and I to spring out from the roadside and leap back aboard as he passed going back to town or any direction opposite from all who would miss me and have authority over me ; the cowardly way , so why did n't I take it , who was already a lost liar , already damned by I'I deceit ; why did n't I go the whole hog and be a coward too ; be irrevocable and irremediable like Faustus be-  | came ? glory in baseness , make , compel my new Master to respect me for my completeness even if he did scorn my size ? Only I did n't . It would n't have worked , one of us anyway had to be practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our way before Cousin Louisa could send someone to the field where Cousin Zack would be at three oclock in the afternoon during planting time , and granted that Cousin Zack could n't possibly have overtaken us on his saddle horse : he would n't have tried to : he would have ridden straight to town and after one minute each with Ned and Cousin Ike , he would have known exactly what to do and would have done it , using the telephone and the police . We were there . I got out and opened the gate ( the same posts of old Lucius Quintus Carothers 's time ; your present Cousin Carothers has a cattle guard in it now so automobiles can cross , not owning hooves ) and we went on up the locust drive toward the house ( it is still there : the two-room mud-chinked log half domicile and half fort which old Lucius came with his slaves and foxhounds across the mountains from Carolina in 1813 and built ; it is still there somewhere , hidden beneath the clapboards and Greek Revival and steamboat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it ) . Cousin Louisa and everybody else on the place had already heard us approaching and ( except probably the ones Cousin Zack could actually see from his horse ) were all on the front gallery and steps and the yard when we drove up and stopped . " All right , " Boon said , again out of the side of his mouth , " do you want . " Because , as you say nowadays , this was it ; no time any more , let alone privacy , to get some  --  any  --  inkling of what he now must desperately know . Because we  --  he and I  --  were so new at this , you  | see . We were worse than amateurs : innocents , complete innocents at stealing automobiles even though neither of us would have called it stealing since we intended to return it unharmed ; and even , if people , the world ( Jefferson anyway ) had just let us alone , unmissed . Even if I could have answered him if he had asked . Because it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us were desperate but mine was the more urgent desperation since I had to do something , and quick , in a matter of seconds now , while all he had to do was sit in the car with at most his fingers crossed . I did n't know what to do now ; I had already told more lies than I had believed myself capable of inventing , and had had them believed or at least accepted with a consistency which had left me spellbound if not already appalled ; I was in the position of the old Negro who said , " Here I is , Lord . If You wants me saved , You got the best chance You ever seen standing right here looking at You . " I had shot my bow , Boon 's too . If Non-virtue still wanted either of us , it was now her move . Which she did . She was dressed as Cousin Zachary Edmonds . He came out the front door at that moment and at the same moment I saw that a Negro boy in the yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what I mean ? Zachary Edmonds , whom Jefferson never saw on a weekday between the first ground-breaking in March and laying-by in July , had been in town this morning ( something urgent about the grist mill ) and had stopped in Cousin Ike 's store barely minutes after I had done so myself ; which , dovetailed neatly and exactly with the hour and more Non-virtue had required to shave Boon and change his shirt , had given Cousin Zack the exact time necessary to ride home and be getting off his horse at his doorstep when they heard us coming . He said  --  to me : " What are you doing out here ? Ike told  | me you were going to stay in town tonight and he is going to take you fishing tomorrow . " So of course Aunt Callie began yelling then so I did n't need to say anything at all even if I had known anything to say . " Fishing ? " she hollered . " On Sunday ? If his paw could hear that , he would jump off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His maw too ! Miss Alison ai nt told him to stay in town with no Mister Ike nor nobody else ! She told him to come on out here with me and these other chillen and if he do nt behave his-self , Mister Zack would make him ! " " All right , all right , " Cousin Zack said . " Stop yelling a minute ; I cant hear him . Maybe he 's changed his mind . Have you ? " " Sir ? " I said . " Yes sir . I mean , no sir . " " Well , which ? Are you going to stay out here , or are you going back with Boon ? " " Yes sir , " I said . " I 'm going back . Cousin Ike told me to ask you if I could . " And Aunt Callie yelled again ( she had never really stopped except for maybe that one long breath when Cousin Zack told her to ) but that was all : she still yelling and Cousin Zack saying , " Stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear my ears . If Ike do nt bring him out tomorrow , I 'll send in for him Monday . " I went back to the car : Boon had the engine already running . " Well I 'll be damned , " he said , not loud but with complete respect , even awe a little . " Come on , " I said . " Get away from here . " We went on , smoothly but quick , faster , back down the drive toward the gate . " Maybe we 're wasting something , just spending it on a automobile trip , " he said . " Maybe I ought to use you for something that 's got money in it . " " Just get on , " I said . Because how could I tell him ,  | how say it to him ? I 'm sick and tired of lying , of having to lie . Because I knew , realised now that it had only begun ; there would be no end to it , not only no end to the lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ones I had already told , but that I would never be free of the old worn-out ones I had already used and exhausted . We went back to town . We went fast this time ; if there was scenery now , nobody in that automobile used any of it . It was going on five oclock now . Boon spoke , tense and urgent but quite composed : " We got to let it cool awhile . They saw me drive out of town taking you folks out to McCaslin ; they 'll see me come back with just you and me alone ; they 'll expect to see me put the car back in Boss 's carriage house . Then they got to see me and you , but separate , just walking around like was n't nothing going on . " But how could I say that either ? No . Let 's go now . If I 've got to tell more lies , at least let it be to strangers . He was still talking : " ? car . What was that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left ? " " What ? Who said ? " " Ned . Back there just before we left town . " " I do nt remember , " I said . " What about the car ? " " Where to leave it . While I take a santer around the Square and you go home and get a clean shirt or whatever you 'll need . I had to unload all the stuff out at McCaslin , remember . Yours too . I mean , just in case some meddling busybody is hanging around just on the happen-chance . " We both knew who he meant . " Why cant you lock it in the carriage house ? " " I ai nt got the key , " he said . " All I got is the lock . Boss took the key away from me this morning and unlocked the lock and give the key to Mr Ballott to keep until he gets back . I 'm supposed to run the car in as soon as I  | get back from McCaslin and lock the lock shut and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door so I can meet them . " " Then we 'll just have to risk it , " I said . " Yes , we 'll have to risk it . Maybe with Boss and Miss Sarah gone , even Delphine ai nt going to see him again until Monday morning . " So we risked it . Boon drove into the carriage house and got his grip and coat down from where he had hidden them in the loft and reached up again and dragged down a folded tarpaulin and put his grip and coat in on the floor of the back seat . The gasoline can was all ready : a brand-new five-gallon can which Grandfather had had the tinsmith who made the toolbox more or less rebuild until it was smell-tight , since Grandmother already did n't like the smell of gasoline , which we had never used yet because the automobile had never been this far before ; the funnel and the chamois strainer were already in the toolbox with the tire tools and jack and wrenches that came with the car , and the lantern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the block and tackle which Grandfather had added , along with the tin bucket to fill the radiator when we passed creeks or barrow pits . He put the can ( it was full ; maybe that was what took him the extra time before he came for us ) in the back and opened the tarpaulin , not spreading it but tumbling it into the back until everything was concealed to just look like a jumbled mass of tarpaulin . " We 'll shove yours under the same way , " he said . " Then it wont look like nothing but a wad of tarpollyon somebody was too lazy to fold up . What you better do is go home and get your clean shirt and come straight back here and wait . I wont be long : just santer around the Square in case Ike wants to start asking questions too . Then we 'll be gone . " We closed the door . Boon started to hang the open padlock back in the staple . " No , " I said ; I could n't even  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil . " Put it in your pocket . " But he knew why ; he told me . " You damn right , " he said . " We done gone through too much to have somebody happen-chance by and snap it shut because they thought I forgot to . " I went home . It was just across the street . A filling station is there now , and what was Grandfather 's house is now chopped into apartments , precarious of tenure . The house was empty , unlocked of course , since nobody in Jefferson locked mere homes in those innocent days . It was only a little after five , nowhere near sundown , yet the day was finished , done for ; the empty silent house was not vacant at all but filled with presences like held breath ; and suddenly I wanted my mother ; I wanted no more of this , no more of free will ; I wanted to return , relinquish , be secure , safe from the sort of decisions and deciding whose foster twin was this having to steal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had already chosen , elected ; if I had sold my soul to Satan for a mess of pottage , at least I would damn well collect the pottage and eat it too : had n't Boon himself just reminded me , almost as if he had foreseen this moment of weakness and vacillation in the empty house , and forewarned me : " We done gone through too much to let nothing stop us now . " My clothes  --  fresh blouses , pants , stockings , my toothbrush  --  were out at McCaslin now . I had more in my drawer of course , except the toothbrush , which in Mother 's absence it was a fair gamble that neither Aunt Callie nor Cousin Louisa would remember about . But I took no clothes , nothing ; not that I forgot to but probably because I had never intended to . I just entered the house and stood inside the door long enough to prove to myself that of Boon and me it would n't be me who failed us , and went back across the street and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor was Boon the one who would fail us ; I heard the engine running quietly before I reached the carriage house . Boon was already behind the wheel ; I think the automobile was even already in gear . " Where 's your clean shirt ? " he said . " Never mind . I 'll buy you one in Memphis . Come on . We can move now . " He backed the car out . The open lock was once more hanging in the staple . " Come on , " he said . " Do nt stop to lock it . It 's too late now . " " No , " I said . I could n't have said then why either : with the padlock snapped through the staple and hasp of the closed door , it would look like the automobile was safely inside . And so it would be : the whole thing no more than a dream from which I could wake tomorrow , perhaps now , the next moment , and be safe , saved . So I closed the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boon to drive out and closed that too and got in , the car already in motion  --  if in fact it had ever completely stopped . " If we go the back way , we can dodge the Square , " I said . And again he said : " It 's too late now . All they can do now is holler . " But none hollered . But even with the Square behind , it still was not too late . That irrevocable decision was still a mile ahead , where the road to McCaslin forked away from the Memphis road , where I could say Stop . Let me out and he would do it . More : I could say I 've changed my mind . Take me back to McCaslin and I knew he would do that too . Then suddenly I knew that if I said Turn around . I will get that key from Mr Ballott and we will lock this automobile up in the carriage house where Boss believes it already is at this moment and he would do that . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was silently begging me to do that ; he and I both aghast not at his individual temerity but at our mutual , our confederated recklessness , and that Boon knew he had  | not the strength to resist his and so must cast himself on my strength and rectitude . You see ? What I told you about Non-virtue ? If things had been reversed and I had silently pled with Boon to turn back , I could have depended on his virtue and pity , where he to whom Boon pled had neither . So I said nothing ; the fork , the last frail impotent hand reached down to save me , flew up and passed and fled , was gone , irrevocable ; I said All right then . Here I come . Maybe Boon heard it , since I was still boss . Anyway , he put Jefferson behind us ; Satan would at least defend his faithful from the first one or two tomorrows ; he said : " We ai nt really got anything to worry about but Hell Creek bottom tomorrow . Harrykin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ? " I said . Hurricane Creek is four miles from town ; you have passed over it so fast all your life you probably do nt even know its name . But people who crossed it then knew it . There was a wooden bridge over the creek itself , but even in the top of summer the approaches to it were a series of mudholes . " That 's what I 'm telling you , " Boon said . " It ai nt anything . Me and Mr Wordwin got through it that day last year without even using the block and tackle : just a shovel and axe Mr Wordwin borrowed from a house about a half a mile away , that now you mention it I do nt believe he took back . Likely though the fellow come and got them the next day . " He was almost right . We got through the first mudhole and even across the bridge . But the other mudhole stopped us . The automobile lurched once , twice , tilted and hung spinning . Boon did n't waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say he had had them shined too ) , and rolled up his pants legs and stepped out into the mud . " Move over , " he said . " Put it in low gear and start when I tell you . Come on . You know how to  | do it ; you learned how this morning . " I got under the wheel . He did n't even stop for the block and tackle . " I do nt need it . It 'll take too much time getting it out and putting it back and we ai nt got time . " He did n't need it . There was a snake fence beside the road ; he had already wrenched the top rail off and , himself knee-deep in mud and water , wedged the end under the back axle and said , " Now . Pour the coal to her , " and lifted the automobile bodily and shot it forward lurching and heaving , by main strength up onto dry ground again , shouting at me : " Shut it off ! Shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he came and shoved me over and got in under the wheel ; he did n't even stop to roll his muddy pants down . Because the sun was almost down now ; it would be nearly dark by the time we reached Ballenbaugh 's , where we would spend the night ; we went as fast as we dared now and soon we were passing Mr Wyott 's  --  a family friend of ours ; Father took me bird hunting there that Christmas  --  which was eight miles from Jefferson and still four miles from the river , with the sun just setting behind the house . We went on ; there would be a moon after a while , because our oil headlights were better to show someone else you were coming rather than to light you where you were going ; when suddenly Boon said , " What 's that smell ? Was it you ? " But before I could deny it he had jerked the automobile to a stop , sat for an instant , then turned and reached back and flung back the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of the car . Ned sat up from the floor . He had on the black suit and hat and the white shirt with the gold collar stud without either collar or tie , which he wore on Sunday ; he even had the small battered band grip ( you would call it a brief or attache case now ) which had belonged to old Lucius McCaslin before even Father was born ; I do nt know what else he might have carried in it  | at other times . All I ever saw in it was the Bible ( likewise from Great-great-grandmother McCaslin ) , which he could n't read , and a pint flask containing maybe a good double tablespoonful of whiskey . " I 'll be a son of a bitch , " Boon said . " I wants a trip too , " Ned said . " Hee hee hee . "  | " I got just as much right to a trip as you and Lucius , " Ned said . " I got more . This automobile belongs to Boss and Lucius ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kin to him a-tall . " " All right , all right , " Boon said . " What I 'm talking about , you laid there under that tarpollyon all the time and let me get out in the mud and lift this whole car out single-handed by main strength . " " And hot under there too , mon , " Ned said . " I do nt see how I stood it . Not to mention having to hold off this here sheet-iron churn from knocking my brains out every time you bounced , let alone waiting for that gasoline or whatever you calls it to get all joogled up to where it would decide to blow up too . What did you aim for me  | to do ? That was just four miles from town . You 'd make me walk back home . " " This is ten miles now , " Boon said . " What makes you think you ai nt going to walk them back home ? " I said , rapidly , quickly : " Have you forgot ? That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well be two miles from Bay St. Louis . " " That 's right , " Ned said pleasantly . " The walking ai nt near so fur from here . " Boon did n't look at him long . " Get out and fold up that tarpollyon where it wont take up no more room than it has to , " he told Ned . " And air it off some too if we got to ride with it . " " It was all that bumping and jolting you done , " Ned said . " You talk like I broke my manners just on purpose to get caught . " Also , Boon lit the headlights while we were stopped , and now he wiped his feet and legs off on a corner of the tarpaulin and put his socks and shoes on and rolled his pants back down ; they were already drying . The sun was gone now ; already you could see the moonlight . It would be full night when we reached Ballenbaugh 's . I understand that Ballenbaugh 's is now a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean during the one or two weeks it takes each new sheriff every four years to discover the true will of the people he thought voted for him ; all that stretch of river bottom which was a part of Thomas Sutpen 's doomed baronial dream and the site of Major de Spain 's hunting camp is now a drainage district ; the wilderness where Boon himself in his youth hunted ( or anyway was present while his betters did ) bear and deer and panther , is tame with cotton and corn now and even Wyott 's Crossing is only a name . Even in 1905 there was still vestigial wilderness , though most of the deer and all the bears and panthers ( also  | Major de Spain and his hunters ) were gone ; the ferry also ; and now we called Wyott 's Crossing the Iron Bridge , THE Iron Bridge since it was the first iron bridge and for several years yet the only one we in Yoknapatawpha County had or knew of . But back in the old days , in the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regicide-usurper who called himself Doom , and the first Wyott came along and the Indians showed him the crossing and he built his store and ferryboat and named it after himself , this was not only the only crossing within miles but the head of navigation too ; boats ( in the high water of winter , even a small steamboat ) came as it were right to Wyott 's front door , bringing the whiskey and plows and coal oil and peppermint candy up from Vicksburg and carrying the cotton and furs back . But Memphis was nearer than Vicksburg even by mule team , so they built a road as straight from Jefferson to the south bend of Wyott 's ferryboat as they could run it , and as straight from the north end of the ferryboat to Memphis as they could run that . So the cotton and freight began to come and go that way , mule- or ox-drawn ; whereupon there appeared immediately from nowhere an ancestryless giant calling himself Ballenbaugh ; some said he actually bought from Wyott the small dim heretofore peaceful one-room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wyott ) considered he had in the old Chickasaw crossing ; others said that Ballenbaugh simply suggested to Wyott that he ( Wyott ) had been there long enough now and the time had come for him to move four miles back from the river and become a farmer . Anyway , that 's what Wyott did . And then his little wilderness-cradled hermitage became a roaring place indeed : it became dormitory , grubbing station and saloon  | for the transient freighters and the fixed crews of hardmouthed hard-souled mule skinners who met the wagons at both edges of the bottom , with two and three and ( when necessary ) four span of already geared-up mules , to curse the heavy wagons in to the ferry on one side of the river , and from the ferry to high ground once more on the other . A roaring place ; who faced it were anyway men . But just tough men then , no more , until Colonel Sartoris ( I do nt mean the banker with his courtesy title acquired partly by inheritance and partly by propinquity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this moment were ; I mean his father , the actual colonel , C.S.A. ? soldier , statesman , politician , duelist ; the collateral descending nephews and cousins of one twentyyear-old Yoknapatawpha County youth say , murderer ) built his railroad in the mid-seventies and destroyed it . But not Ballenbaugh 's , let alone Ballenbaugh . The wagon trains came and drove the boats from the river and changed the name of Wyott 's Crossing to Ballenbaugh 's Ferry ; the railroads came and removed the cotton bales from the wagons and therefore the ferry from Ballenbaugh 's , but that was all ; forty years before , in the modest case of the trader , Wyott , Ballenbaugh showed himself perfectly capable of anticipating the wave of the future and riding it ; now , in the person of his son , another giant who in 1865 returned with ( it was said ) his coat lined with uncut United States bank notes , from ( he said ) Arkansas , where ( he said ) he had served and been honorably discharged from a troop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never subsequently able to recall , he showed that he had lost none of his old deftness and skill and omniscience . Formerly , people passed through Ballenbaugh 's , pausing for the night ; now they travelled to Ballenbaugh 's , always at night and often rapidly , to give Ballenbaugh as much time as pos-  | sible to get the horse or cow concealed in the swamp before the law or the owner arrived . Because , in addition to gangs of angry farmers following the nonreturning prints of horses and cattle , and sheriffs following those of actual murderers into Ballenbaugh 's , at least one federal revenue agent left a set of nonreturning footprints . Because where Ballenbaugh senior merely sold whiskey , this one made it too ; he was now the patron of what is covered by the euphemistic blanket-term of dance hall , and by the mid-eighties Ballenbaugh 's was a byword miles around for horror and indignation ; ministers and old ladies tried to nominate sheriffs whose entire platform would be running Ballenbaugh and his drunks and fiddlers and gamblers and girls out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ballenbaugh and his entourage  --  stable , pleasure-dome , whatever you want to call it  --  never bothered us outsiders : they never came out of their fastness and there was no law compelling anyone to go there ; also , seemingly his new avocation ( avatar ) was so rewarding that word went round that anyone with sights and ambition no higher than one spavined horse or dry heifer was no longer welcome there . So sensible people simply let Ballenbaugh 's alone . Which certainly included sheriffs , who were not only sensible but family men too , and who had the example of the federal revenuer who had vanished in that direction not so long ago . That is , until the summer of 1886 , when a Baptist minister named Hiram Hightower  --  also a giant of a man , as tall and almost as big as Ballenbaugh himself , who on Sunday from 1861 to 1865 had been one of Forrest 's company chaplains and on the other six days one of his hardest and most outrageous troopers  --  rode into Ballenbaugh 's armed with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his fists , one  | at a time when he could , two or three at a time when he had to . So when Boon and Ned and I approached it in this May dusk of 1905 , Ballenbaugh was accomplishing his third avatar in the person of a fifty-year-old maiden : his only child : a prim fleshless severe iron-gray woman who farmed a quarter section of good bottom cotton- and corn-land and conducted a small store with a loft above it containing a row of shuck mattresses each with its neat perfectly clean sheets and pillow cases and blankets for the accommodation of fox- and coon-hunters and fishermen , who ( it was said ) returned the second time not for the hunting and fishing but for the table Miss Ballenbaugh set . She heard us too . Nor were we the first ; she told us that we were the thirteenth automobile to pass there in the last two years , five of them in the last forty days ; she had already lost two hens and would probably have to begin keeping everything penned up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Negro man were already on the front gallery , shading their eyes against the ghostly flicker of our headlights as we drove up . She not only knew Boon of old , she recognised the automobile first ; already , even after only thirteen of them , her eye for individual cars was that good . " So you really did make it to Jefferson , after all , " she said . " In a year ? " Boon said . " Lord , Miss Ballenbaugh , this automobile has been a hundred times farther than Jefferson since then . A thousand times . You might as well give up : you got to get used to automobiles like everybody else . " That was when she told us about the thirteen cars in two years , and the two hens . " At least they got a ride on an automobile for a little piece anyway , " she said . " Which is more than I can say . " " You mean to say you ai nt never rode in one ? " Boon  | said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " jump out of there and get them grips out too . Loosh , let Miss Ballenbaugh set up in front where she can see out . " " Wait , " Miss Ballenbaugh said . " I must tell Alice about supper . " " Supper can wait , " Boon said . " I bet Alice ai nt never had a car ride neither . Come on , Alice . Who 's that with you ? Your husband ? " " I ai nt studying no husband , " the cook said . " And I would n't be studying Ephum even if I was . " " Bring him on anyway , " Boon said . The cook and the man came and got in too , into the back seat with the gasoline can and the folded tarpaulin . Ned and I stood in the lamplight from the open door and watched the automobile , the red tail lamp , move on up the road , then stop and back and turn and come back past us , Boon blowing the horn now , Miss Ballenbaugh sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alice and Ephum in the back seat waving to us as they passed . " Whooee , boy , " Ephum shouted at Ned . " Git a horse ! " " Showing off , " Ned said ; he meant Boon . " He better be sho proud Boss Priest ai nt standing here too . He 'd show him off . " The car stopped and backed and turned again and came back to us and stopped . After a moment Miss Ballenbaugh said , " Well . " Then she moved ; she said briskly : " All right , Alice . " So we had supper . And I knew why the hunters and fishermen came back . Then Ned went off with Ephum and I made my manners to Miss Ballenbaugh and , Boon carrying the lamp , we went upstairs to the loft above the store . " Did n't you bring nothing ? " Boon said . " Not even a clean handkerchief ? " " I wont need anything , " I said . " Well , you cant sleep like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off your shoes and pants . And your maw would make you brush your teeth too . " " No she would n't , " I said . " She could n't . I ai nt got anything to brush them with . " " That would n't stop her , and you know it . If you could n't find something , you 'd make something to do it with or know the reason why . " " " All right , " I said . I was already on my mattress . " Good night . " He stood with his hand up to blow out the lamp . " You all right ? " he said . " Shut up , " I said . " Say the word . We 'll go back home . Not now but in the morning . " " Did you wait this long to get scared ? " I said . " Good night , " he said . He blew out the lamp and got on his mattress . Then there was all the spring darkness : the big bass-talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes , the big woods , the wilderness with the wild things : coons and rabbits and mink and mushrats and the big owls and the big snakes  --  moccasins and rattlers  --  and maybe even the trees breathing and the river itself breathing , not to mention the ghosts  --  the old Chickasaws who named the land before the white men ever saw it , and the white men afterward  --  Wyott and old Sutpen and Major de Spain 's hunters and the flatboats full of cotton and then the wagon trains and the brawling teamsters and the line of brigands and murderers which produced Miss Ballenbaugh ; suddenly I realised what the noise was that Boon was making . " What are you laughing at ? " I said . " I 'm thinking about Hell Creek bottom . We 'll hit it about eleven oclock tomorrow morning . " " I thought you said we 'll have trouble there . " " You damn right we will , " Boon said . " It 'll take that axe and shovel and bob wire and block and tackle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ned all three . That 's who I 'm laughing at : Ned . By the time we are through Hell Creek tomorrow , he 's going to wish he had n't busted what he calls his manners nor et nor done nothing else under that tarpollyon until he felt Memphis itself under them wheels . " Then he waked me early . And everybody else within a half mile , though it still took some time to get Ned up from where he had slept in Ephum 's house , to the kitchen to eat his breakfast ( and even longer than that to get him out of the kitchen again with a woman in it ) . We ate breakfast  --  and after that breakfast if I had been a hunter or a fisherman I would n't have felt like walking anywhere for a while  --  and Boon gave Miss Ballenbaugh another ride in the automobile , but without Alice and Ephum this time , though Ephum was on hand . Then we  --  Boonfilled the gasoline tank and the radiator , not because they needed it but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and started . The sun was just rising as we crossed the Iron Bridge over the river ( and the ghost of that steamboat too ; I had forgot that last night ) into foreign country , another county ; by night it would even be another state , and Memphis . " Providing we get through Hell Creek , " Boon said . " Maybe if you 'd just stop talking about it , " I said . " Sure , " Boon said . " Hell Creek bottom do nt care whether you talk about it or not . It do nt have to give a durn . You 'll see . " Then he said , " Well , there it is . " It was only a little after ten ; we had made excellent time following the ridges , the roads dry and dusty between the sprouting fields , the land vacant and peaceful with Sunday , the people already in their Sunday clothes idle on the front galleries , the children and dogs already running toward the fence or road to watch us pass ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and  | mule-back , anywhere from one to three on the horse but not on the mule ( a little after nine we passed another automobile ; Boon said it was a Ford ; he had an eye for automobiles like Miss Ballenbaugh 's ) , on the way to the small white churches in the spring groves . A wide valley lay before us , the road descending from the plateau toward a band of willow and cypress which marked the creek . It did n't look very bad to me , nowhere near as wide as the river bottom we had already crossed , and we could even see the dusty gash of the road mounting to the opposite plateau beyond it . But Boon had already started to curse , driving even faster down the hill almost as if he were eager , anxious to reach and 41 join battle with it , as if it were something sentient , not merely inimical but unredeemable , like a human enemy , another man . " Look at it , " he said . " Innocent as a newlaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it was laughing at us , like it was saying If you could just get it here you could darn near see Memphis ; except just see if you can get here . " " If it 's all that bad , why do nt we go around it ? " Ned said . " That 's what I would do if it was me setting there where you is . " " Because Hell Creek bottom ai nt got no around , " Boon said violently . " Go one way and you 'd wind up in Alabama ; go the other way and you 'll fall off in the Missippi River . " " I seen the Missippi River at Memphis once , " Ned said . " Now you mention it , I done already seen Memphis too . But I ai nt never seen Alabama . Maybe I 'd like a trip there . " " You ai nt never visited Hell Creek bottom before neither , " Boon said . " Providing what you hid under that tarpollyon for yesterday is education . Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and  | Jefferson was this one and that Ford ? Because there ai nt no other automobiles in Missippi below Hell Creek , that 's why . " " Miss Ballenbaugh counted thirteen passed her house in the last two years , " I said . " Two of them was this one , " Boon said . " And even them other eleven she never counted crossing Hell Creek , did she ? " " Maybe it depends on who 's doing the driving , " Ned said . " Hee hee hee . " Boon stopped the car , quickly . He turned his head . " All right . Jump out . You want to visit Alabama . You done already made yourself fifteen minutes late running your mouth . " " Why you got to snatch a man up just for passing the day with you ? " Ned said . But Boon was n't listening to him . I do nt think he was really speaking to Ned . He was already out of the car ; he opened the toolbox Grandfather had had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and axe and spade and the lantern , taking everything out but the lantern and tumbling them into the back seat with Ned . " So we wont waste any time , " he said , speaking rapidly , but quite composed , calm , without hysteria or even urgency , closing the box and getting back under the wheel . " Let 's hit it . What 're we waiting for ? " Still it did n't look bad to me  --  just another country road crossing another swampy creek , the road no longer dry but not really wet yet , the holes and boggy places already filled for our convenience by previous pioneers with brush tops and limbs , and sections of it even corduroyed with poles laid crossways in the mud ( oh yes , I realised suddenly that the road  --  for lack of any closer term  --  had stopped being not really wet yet too ) so perhaps Boon himself was responsible ; he himself had populated the  | stagnant cypress- and willow-arched mosquito-whined gloom with the wraiths of stuck automobiles and sweating and cursing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for that fact that I not only could n't see any rise of drier ground which would indicate we were reaching , approaching the other side of the swamp , I could n't even see the creek itself ahead yet , let alone a bridge . Again the automobile lurched , canted , and hung as it did yesterday at Hurricane Creek ; again Boon was already removing his shoes and socks and rolling up his pants . " All right , " he said to Ned over his shoulder , " get out . " " I do nt know how , " Ned said , not moving . " I ai nt learned about automobiles yet . I 'll just be in your way . I 'll set here with Lucius so you can have plenty of room . " " Hee hee hee , " Boon said in savage and vicious mimicry . " You wanted a trip . Now you got one . Get out . " " I got my Sunday clothes on , " Ned said . " So have I , " Boon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of britches , you need n't be " " You can talk , " Ned said . " You got Mr Maury . I has to work for my money . When my clothes gets mint or wore out , I has to buy new ones myself . " " You never bought a garment of clothes or shoes or a hat neither in your life , " Boon said . " You got one pigeontailed coat I know of that old Lucius McCaslin himself wore , let alone General Compson 's and Major de Spain 's and Boss 's too . You can roll your britches up and take off your shoes or not , that 's your business . But you 're going to get out of this automobile . " " Let Lucius get out , " Ned said . " He 's younger than me and stouter too for his size . " " He 's got to steer it , " Boon said . " I 'll steer it , if that 's all you needs , " Ned said . " I been what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and I reckon gee and haw with that steering wheel  | ai nt no different from gee and haw with a pair of lines or a goad . " Then to me : " Jump out , boy , and help Mr Boon . Better take your shoes and stockings ? " " Are you going to get out , or do I pick you up with one hand and snatch this automobile out from under you with the other ? " Boon said . Ned moved then , fast enough when he finally accepted the fact that he had to , only grunting a little as he took off his shoes and rolled up his pants and removed his coat . When I looked back at Boon , he was already dragging two poles , sapling-sized tree trunks , out of the weeds and briers . " Ai nt you going to use the block and tackle yet ? " I said . " Hell no , " Boon said . " When the time comes for that , you wont need to ask nobody 's permission about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the bridge I thought . Maybe there 's not even a bridge at all and that 's what 's wrong . And Boon read my mind there too . " Do n't worry about the bridge . We ai nt even come to the bridge yet . " I would learn what he meant by that too , but not now . Ned lowered one foot gingerly into the water . " This water got dirt in it , " he said . " If there 's one thing I hates , it 's dirt betwixt my nekkid toes . " " That 's because your circulation ai nt warmed up yet , " Boon said . " Take a-holt of this pole . You said you ai nt acquainted with automobiles yet . That 's one complaint you wont never have to make again for the rest of your life . All right " ? to me ? " ease her ahead now and whenever she bites , keep her going . " Which we did , Boon and Ned levering their poles forward under the back axle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or sometimes five feet , until the car hung spinning again , the whirling back wheels coating them both from knee to crown as if they had been swung at with one of the spray nozzles which house painters use now . " See what I mean ? " Boon said , spitting , giving another terrific wrench  | and heave which sent us lurching forward , " about getting acquainted with automobiles ? Exactly like horses and mules : do nt never stand directly behind one that 's got one hind foot already lifted . " Then I saw the bridge . We had come up onto a patch of earth so ( comparatively ) dry that Boon and Ned , almost indistinguishable now with mud , had to trot with their poles and even then could n't keep up , Boon hollering , panting , " Go on ! Keep going ! " until I saw the bridge a hundred yards ahead and then saw what was still between us and the bridge and I knew what he meant . I stopped the car . The road ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of us had not altered so much as it had transmogrified , exchanged mediums , elements . It now resembled a big receptacle of milk-infused coffee from which protruded here and there a few forlorn impotent hopeless odds and ends of sticks and brush and logs and an occasional hump of actual earth which looked startlingly like it had been deliberately thrown up by a plow . Then I saw something else , and understood what Boon had been telling me by indirection about Hell Creek bottom for over a year now , and what he had been reiterating with a kind of haunted bemused obsession ever since we left Jefferson yesterday . Standing hitched to a tree just off the road ( canal ) were two mules in plow gear  --  that is , in bridles and collars and hames , the trace chains looped over the hames and the plowlines coiled into neat hanks and hanging from the hames also ; leaning against another tree nearby was a heavy double-winged plow  --  a middlebuster  --  caked , wings shank and the beam itself , with more of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doubletree , likewise mudcaked , leaning against the plow ; and in the immediate background a new two-room paintless shotgun cabin on the gallery of which a man sat tilted in a splint chair ,  | barefoot , his galluses down about his waist and his ( likewise muddy ) brogan shoes against the wall beside the chair . And I knew that this , and not Hurricane Creek , was where ( Boon said ) he and Mr Wordwin had had to borrow the shovel last year , which ( Boon said ) Mr Wordwin had forgot to return , and which ( the shovel ) Mr Wordwin might as well have forgot to bon-ow also for all the good it did them . Ned had seen it too . He had already had one hard look at the mudhole . Now he looked at the already geared-up rnules standing there swishing and slapping at mosquitoes while they waited for us . " Now , that 's what I calls convenient ? " he said . " Shut up , " Boon said in a fierce murmur . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He spoke in a tense controlled fury , propping his muddy pole against the car and hauling out the block and tackle and the barbed wire and the axe and spade . He said Son of a bitch three times . Then he said to me : " You too . " " Me ? " I said . " But look at them mules , " Ned said . " He even got a log chain already hooked to that doubletree ? " " Did n't you hear me say shut up ? " Boon said in that fierce , quite courteous murmur . " If I did n't speak plain enough , excuse me . What I 'm trying to say is , shut up . " " Only , what in the world do he want with the middlebuster ? " Ned said . " And it muddy clean up to the handles too . Like he been ? You mean to say he gets in here with that team and works this place like a patch just to keep it boggy ? " Boon had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands . For a second I thought he would strike Ned with any one or maybe all three of them . I said quickly : " What do you want me ? " " Yes , " Boon said . " It will take all of us . I  --  me and  | Mr Wordwin had a little trouble with him here last year ; we got to get through this time ? " " How much did you have to pay him last year to get drug out ? " Ned said . " Two dollars , " Boon said . " ? so you better take off your whole pants , take off your shirt too ; it 'll be all right here ? " " Two dollars ? " Ned said . " This sho beats cotton . He can farm right here setting in the shade without even moving . What I wants Boss to get me is a well-travelled mudhole . " " Fine , " Boon said . " You can learn how on this one . " He gave Ned the block and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it yonder to that willow , the big one , and get a good bolt with it . " Ned payed out the rope and carried the head block to the tree . I took off my pants and shoes and stepped down into the mud . It felt good , cool . Maybe it felt that way to Boon too . Or maybe his  --  Ned 's too ? was just release , freedom from having to waste any time now trying not to get muddy . Anyway , from now on he simply ignored the mud , squatting in it , saying Son of a bitch quietly and steadily while he fumbled the other piece of barbed wire into a loop on the front of the car to hook the block in . " Here , " he told me , " you be dragging up some of that brush over yonder , " reading my mind again too : " I do nt know where it came from neither . Maybe he stacks it up there himself to keep handy for folks so they can find out good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I dragged up the brush  --  branches , tops  --  into the mud in front of the car , while Boon and Ned took up the slack in the tackle and got ready , Ned and I on the take-up rope of the tackle , Boon at the back of the car with his prize pole again . " You got the easy job , " he told us . " All you got to do is grab and hold when I heave . All right , " he said , " Let 's go . "  | There was something dreamlike about it . Not nightmarish : just dreamlike  --  the peaceful , quiet , remote , sylvan , almost primeval setting of ooze and slime and jungle growth and heat in which the very mules themselves , peacefully swishing and stamping at the teeming infinitesimal invisible myriad life which was the actual air we moved and breathed in , were not only unalien but in fact curiously appropriate , being themselves biological dead ends and hence already obsolete before they were born ; the automobile : the expensive useless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of horses , yet held helpless and impotent in the almost infantile clutch of a few inches of the temporary confederation of two mild and pacific elements  --  earth and water  --  which the frailest integers and units of motion as produced by the ancient unmechanical methods , had coped with for countless generations without really having noticed it ; the three of us , three forked identical and now unrecognisable mud-colored creatures engaged in a life-and-death struggle with it , the progress  --  if any  --  of which had to be computed in dreadful and glacier-like inches . And all the while , the man sat in his tilted chair on the gallery watching us while Ned and I strained for every inch we could get on the rope which by now was too slippery with mud to grip with the hands , and at the rear of the car Boon strove like a demon , titanic , ramming his pole beneath the automobile and lifting and heaving it forward ; at one time he dropped , flung away the pole and , stooping , grasped the car with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two as though it were a wheelbarrow . No man could stand it . No man should ever have to . I said so at last . I stopped pulling , I said , panted : " No . We cant do it . We just cant . " And Boon , in an expiring voice as faint and gentle as the whisper of love : " Then get out of the way or I 'll run it over you . "  | " No , " I said . I stumbled , slipping and plunging , back to him . " No , " I said . " You 'll kill yourself . " " I ai nt tired , " Boon said in that light dry voice . " I 'm just getting started good . But you and Ned can take a rest . While you 're getting your breath , suppose you drag up some more of that brush ? " " No , " I said , " no ! Here he comes ! Do you want him to see it ? " Because we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plop of the mules ' feet as they picked their delicate way along the edge of the mudhole , the almost musical jangle of the looped chains , the man riding one and leading the other , his shoes tied together by the laces looped over one of the hames , the doubletree balanced in front of him as the old buffalo hunters in the pictures carried their guns  --  a gaunt man , older than we  --  I anyway  --  had assumed . " Morning , boys , " he said . " Looks like you 're about ready for me now . Howdy , Jefferson , " he said to Boon . " Looks like you did get through last summer , after all . " " Looks like it , " Boon said . He had changed , instantaneous and complete , like a turned page : the poker player who has just seen the second deuce fall to a hand across the table . " We might a got through this time too if you folks did n't raise such heavy mud up here . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Mud 's one of our best crops up thisaway . " " At two dollars a mudhole , it ought to be your best , " Ned said . The man blinked at Ned a moment . " I do nt know but what you 're right , " he said . " Here . You take this doubletree ; you look like a boy that knows which end of a mule to hook to . " " Get down and do it yourself , " Boon said . " Why else are we paying you two dollars to be the hired expert ? You done it last year . " " That was last year , " the man said . " Dabbling around  | in this water hooking log chains to them things undermined my system to where I come down with rheumatism if I so much as spit on myself . " So he did n't stir . He just brought the mules up and turned them side by side while Boon and Ned hooked the trace chains to the singletrees and then Boon squatted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car . " What do you want me to hook it to ? " he said . " I do nt care myself , " the man said . " Hook up to any part of it you want out of this mudhole . If you want all of it to come out at the same time , I 'd say hook to the axle . But first I 'd put all them spades and ropes back in the automobile . You wont need them no more , at least here . " So Ned and I did that , and Boon hooked up and we all three stood clear and watched . He was an expert of course , but by now the mules were experts too , breaking the automobile free of the mud , keeping the strain balanced on the doubletree as delicately as wire walkers , getting the automobile into motion and keeping it there with no more guidance than a word now and then from the man who rode the near mule , and an occasional touch from the peeled switch he carried ; on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right , Ned , " Boon said . " Unhook him . " " Not yet , " the man said . " There 's another hole just this side of the bridge that I 'm throwing in free . You ai nt been acquainted here for a year now . " He said to Ned : " What we call the reserve patch up thisaway . " " You means the Christmas middle , " Ned said . " Maybe I do , " the man said . " What is it ? " Ned told him . " It 's how we done at McCaslin back before the Surrender when old L.Q.C. was alive , and how the Edmonds boy still does . Every spring a middle is streaked off in the best ground on the place , and every stalk of cotton betwixt that middle and the edge of the  | field belongs to the Christmas fund , not for the boss but for every McCaslin nigger to have a Christmas share of it . That 's what a Christmas middle is . Likely you mudfarming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man looked at Ned awhile . After a while Ned said , " Hee hee hee . " " That 's better , " the man said . " I thought for a minute me and you was about to misunderstand one another . " He said to Boon : " Maybe somebody better guide it . " " Yes , " Boon said . " All right , " he told me . So I got under the wheel , mud and all . But we did n't move yet . The man said , " I forgot to mention it , so maybe I better . Prices have doubled around here since last year . " " Why ? " Boon said . " It 's the same car , the same mudhole ; be damned if : I do nt believe it 's even the same mud . " " That was last year . There 's more business now . So much more that I cant afford not to go up . " " All right , goddammit , " Boon said . " Go on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mules , on , into the next mudhole without stopping , on and out again . The bridge was just ahead now ; beyond it , we could see the road all the way to the edge of the bottom and safety . " You 're all right now , " the man said . " Until you come back . " Boon was unhooking the log chain while Ned freed the traces and handed the doubletree back up to the man on the mule . " We ai nt coming back this way , " Boon said . " I would n't neither , " the man said . Boon went back to the last puddle and washed some of the mud from his hands and came back and took four dollars from his wallet . The man did n't move . " It 's six dollars , " he said . " Last year it was two dollars , " Boon said . " You said it 's double now . Double two is four . All right . Here 's four dollars . "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " There was two of you last year . That was two dollars . The price is doubled now . There 's three of you . That 's six dollars . Maybe you 'd rather walk back to Jefferson than pay two dollars , but maybe that boy and that nigger would n't . " " And maybe I ai nt gone up neither , " Boon said . " Suppose I do nt pay you six dollars . Suppose in fact I do nt pay you nothing . " " You can do that too , " the man said . " These mules has had a hard day , but I reckon there 's still enough git in them to drag that thing back where they got it from . " But Boon had already quit , given up , surrendered . " God damn it , " he said , " this boy ai nt nothing but a child ! Sholy for just a little child ? " " Walking back to Jefferson might be lighter for him , " the man said , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Boon said , " but look at the other one ! When he gets that mud washed off , he ai nt even white ! " The man looked at distance awhile . Then he looked at Boon . " Son , " he said , " both these mules is color-blind. "  | Boon had told Ned and me that , once we had conquered Hell Creek bottom , we would be in civilisation ; he drew a picture of all the roads from there on cluttered thick as fleas with automobiles . Though maybe it was necessary first to put Hell Creek as far behind us as limbo , or forgetfulness , or at least out of sight ; maybe we would not be worthy of civilisation until we had got the Hell Creek mud off . Anyway , nothing happened yet . The man took his six dollars and went away with his mules and doubletree ; I noticed in fact that he did n't return to his little house but went on back through the swamp and vanished , as if the day were over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nt a hog , " Ned said . " He do nt need to be . He 's done already made six dollars and it ai nt even dinnertime yet . " " It is as far as I 'm concerned , " Boon said . " Bring the  | lunch too . " So we took the lunch box Miss Ballenbaugh had packed for us and the block and tackle and axe and shovel and our shoes and stockings and my pants ( we could n't do anything about the automobile , besides being a waste of work until we could reach Memphis , where surely  --  at least we hoped  --  there would n't be any more mudholes ) and went back down to the creek and washed the tools off and coiled down the block and tackle . And there was n't much to be done about Boon 's and Ned 's clothes either , though Boon got bodily into the water , clothes and all , and washed himself off and tried to persuade Ned to follow suit since he  --  Boon  --  had a change of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to remove his shirt and put his coat back on . I think I told you about his attache case , which he did n't so much carry when abroad as he wore it , as diplomats wear theirs , carrying ( I mean Ned 's Bible and the two tablespoonfuls of  --  probably  --  Grandfather 's best whiskey ) I suspect at times even less in them . Then we ate lunch  --  the ham and fried chicken and biscuits and homemade pear preserves and cake and the jug of buttermilk  --  and put back the emergency muddefying gear ( which in the end had been not a defiance but an inglorious brag ) and measured the gasoline tank ? a gesture not to distance but to time  --  and went on . Because the die was indeed cast now ; we looked not back to remorse or regret or might-have-been ; if we crossed Rubicon when we crossed the Iron Bridge into another county , when we conquered Hell Creek we locked the portcullis and set the bridge on fire . And it did seem as though we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or refusal to recognise defeat when we faced it or it faced us . Or maybe it was just Virtue who had given up , relinquished us to Nonvirtue to cherish and nurture and coddle in the style  | whose right we had won with the now irrevocable barter of our souls . The very land itself seemed to have changed . The farms were bigger , more prosperous , with tighter fences and painted houses and even barns ; the very air was urban . We came at last to a broad highway running string-straight into distance and heavily marked with wheel prints ; Boon said , with a kind of triumph , as if we had doubted him or as if he had invented it to disprove us , created it , cleared and graded and smoothed it with his own hands ( and perhaps even added the wheel marks ) : " What did I tell you ? The highway to Memphis . " We could see for miles ; much closer than that was a rapid and mounting cloud of dust like a portent , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that much of it ; we were not even surprised when it contained an automobile ; we passed each other , commingling our dust into one giant cloud like a pillar , a signpost raised and set to cover the land with the adumbration of the future : the antlike to and fro , the incurable down-payment itch-foot ; the mechanised , the mobilised , the inescapable destiny of America . And now , gray with dust from toes to eyelids ( particularly Boon 's still-damp clothes ) , we could make time , even if , for a while , not speed ; without switching off the engine Boon got out and walked briskly around the car to my side , saying briskly to me : " All right . Slide over . You know how . Just do nt get the idea you 're a forty-milea-hour railroad engine . " So I drove , on across the sunny May afternoon . I could n't look at it though , I was too busy , too concentrated ( all right , too nervous and proud ) : the Sabbath afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the mules themselves Sabbatical and idle in the pastures , the people still in their Sunday clothes on galleries and in shady yards with  | glasses of lemonade or saucers of the ice cream left from dinner . Then we made speed too ; Boon said , " We 're coming to some towns now . I better take it . " We went on . Civilisation was now constant : single country stores and crossroads hamlets ; we were barely free of one before here was another ; commerce was rife about us , the air was indeed urban , the very dust itself which we raised and moved in had a metropolitan taste to tongue and nostrils ; even the little children and the dogs no longer ran to the gates and fences to watch us and the three other automobiles we had passed in the last thirteen miles . Then the country itself was gone . There were no longer intervals between the houses and shops and stores ; suddenly before us was a wide tree-bordered and ordered boulevard with car tracks in the middle ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conductor and motorman just lowering the back trolley and raising the front one to turn it around and go back to Main Street . " Two minutes to five oclock , " Boon said . " Twenty-three and a half hours ago we were in Jefferson , Missippi , eighty miles away . A record . " I had been in Memphis before ( so had Ned . This morning he had told us so ; thirty minutes from now he would prove it ) but always by train , never like this : to watch Memphis grow , increase ; to assimilate it deliberately like a spoonful of ice cream in the mouth . I had never thought about it other than to assume we would go to the Gayoso Hotel as we  --  I anyway  --  always had . So I do nt know what mind Boon read this time . " We 're going to a kind a boarding house I know , " he said . " You 'll like it . I had a letter last week from one of the g ? ladies staying there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll even have somebody to play with . The cook can locate a place for Ned to sleep too . " " Hee bee bee , " Ned said . Besides the streetcars there  | were buggies and surreys  --  phaetons , traps , stanhopes , at least one victoria , the horses a little white-eyed at us but still collected ; evidently Memphis horses were already used to automobiles  --  so Boon could n't turn his head to look at Ned . But he could turn one eye . " Just what do you mean by that ? " he said . " Nothing , " Ned said . " Mind where you 're going and nemmine me . Nemmine me nohow . I got friends here too . You just show me where this automobile gonter be at tomorrow morning and I 'll be there too . " " And you damn well better be , " Boon said . " If you aim to go back to Jefferson in it . Me and Lucius never invited you on this trip so you ai nt none of mine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned , I do nt give a damn whether you come back or not . " " When we gets this automobile back in Jefferson and has to try to look Boss Priest and Mr Maury in the eye , ai nt none of us gonter have time to give a damn who is back and who ai nt , " Ned said . But it was too late now , far too late to keep on bringing that up . So Boon just said , " All right , all right . All I said was , if you want to be back in Jefferson when you start doing your not having time to give a damn , you better be where I can see you when I start back . " We were getting close to Main Street now  --  the tall buildings , the stores , the hotels : the Gaston ( gone now ) and the Peabody ( they have moved it since ) and the Gayoso , to which all us **26;283;TOOLONG devoted our allegiance as to a family shrine because our remote uncle and cousin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a member of the party of horsemen which legend said ( that is , legend to some people maybe . To us it was historical fact ) General Forrest 's brother led at a gallop into the lobby itself and almost captured a Yankee general . We did n't go that  | far though . Boon turned into a side street , almost a back alley , with two saloons at the corner and lined with houses that did n't look old or new either , all very quiet , as quiet as Jefferson itself on Sunday afternoon . Boon in fact said so . " You ought to seen it last night , I bet . On any Saturday night . Or even on a week night when there 's a fireman 's or policeman 's or a Elk or something convention in town . " " Maybe they 've all gone to early prayer meeting , " I said . " No , " Boon said . " I do nt think so . Likely they 're just resting . " " From what ? " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back seat . Obviously , we were learning , Ned had been in Memphis before . Though probably even Grandfather , though he might have known when , did n't know how often . And you see , I was only eleven . This time , the street being empty , Boon did turn his head . " Just one more out of you , " he told Ned . " One more which ? " Ned said . " All I says is , point out where this thing gonter be at tomorrow morning , and I 'll already be setting in it when it leaves . " So Boon did . We were almost there : a house needing about the same amount of paint the others did , in a small grassless yard but with a sort of lattice vestibule like a well house at the front door . Boon stopped the car at the curb . Now he could turn and look at Ned . " All right , " he said . " I 'm taking you at your word . And you better take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow morning . And I mean the first stroke , not the last one . Because I ai nt even going to be here to hear it . " Ned was already getting out , carrying his little grip and his muddy shirt . " Ai nt you got enough troubles of your  | own on your mind , without trying to tote mine too ? " he said . " If you can finish your business here by eight oclock tomorrow morning , how come you think I cant neither ? " He walked on . Then he said , still walking on and not looking back : " Hee hee hee . " " Come on , " Boon said . " Miss Reba 'll let us wash up . " We got out . Boon reached into the back and started to pick up his grip and said , " Oh yes , " and reached to the dashboard and took the switch key out of the slot and put it in his pocket and started to pick up the grip and stopped and took the switch key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You keep it . I might lay it down somewhere and mislay it . Put it in your pocket good so it wont fall out . You can wad your handkerchief on top of it . " I took the key and he started to reach for the grip again and stopped again and looked quick over his shoulder at the boarding house and turned sideways a little and took his wallet out of his hind pocket and opened it close to him and took out a five-dollar bill and stopped and then took out a one-dollar bill also and closed the wallet and slid it toward me behind his body , saying , not quick so much as quiet : " Keep this too . I might forget it somewhere too . Whenever we need money out of it I 'll tell you how much to give me . " Because I had never been inside a boarding house either ; and remember , I was just eleven . So I put the wallet into my pocket too and Boon took the grip and we went through the gate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was the front door . Boon had barely touched the bell when we heard feet inside . " What did I tell you ? " Boon said rapidly . " They probably are all peeping from behind the window curtains at that automobile . " The door opened . It was a young Negro woman but before she could open her mouth a white woman pushed her aside ? a young woman too , with a kind hard handsome face  | and hair that was too red , with two of the biggest yellowish-colored diamonds I ever saw in her ears . " Dammit , Boon , " she said . " The minute Corrie got that dispatch yesterday I told her to telegraph you right back not to bring that child here . I 've already had one in the house for a week now , and one hell-on-wheels is enough for any house or street either for that matter . Or even all Memphis , providing it 's that one we already got . And do nt lie that you never got the message neither . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have already left Jefferson before it got there . What do you want me to do with him then ? tie him out in the yard ? " " Come on in , " she said . She moved out of the door so we could enter ; as soon as we did so , the maid locked the door again . I did n't know why then ; maybe that was the way all people in Memphis did , even while they were at home . It was like any other hall , with a stairway going up , only at once I smelled something ; the whole house smelled that way . I had never smelled it before . I did n't dislike it ; I was just surprised . I mean , as soon as I smelled it , it was like a smell I had been waiting all my life to smell . I think you should be tumbled pell-mell , without warning , only into experience which you might well have spent the rest of your life not having to meet . But with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not really decent of Circumstance , Fate , not to prepare you first , especially when the preparation is as simple as just being fifteen years old . That was the kind of smell it was . The woman was still talking . " You know as well as I do that Mr Binford disapproves like hell of kids using houses for holiday vacations ; you heard him last summer when Corrie brought that little s.o.b . in here the first time because she claims he do nt get enough refinement on that Arkansas tenant farm . Like Mr Binford says , they 'll be in here soon enough anyhow , so why rush them until at  | least they have some jack and are capable of spending it . Not to mention the customers , coming in here for business and finding instead we 're running a damn kindergarden . " We were in the dining room now . It had a Pianola in it . The woman was still talking . " What 's his name ? " " Lucius , " Boon said . " Make your manners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did so , the way I always did : that I reckon Grandfather 's mother taught him and Grandmother taught Father and Mother taught us : what Ned called " drug my foot . " When I straightened up , Miss Reba was watching me . She had a curious look on her face . " I 'll be damned , " she said . " Minnie , did you see that ? Is Miss Corrie ? " " She dressing as fast as she can , " the maid said . And that was when I saw it . I mean , Minnie 's tooth . I mean , that was how  --  yes , why  --  I , you , people , everybody , remembered Minnie . She had beautiful teeth anyhow , like small richly alabaster matched and evenly serrated headstones against the rich chocolate of her face when she smiled or spoke . But she had more . The middle righthand upper one was gold ; in her dark face it reigned like a queen among the white dazzle of the others , seeming actually to glow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of more than gold , until that single tooth appeared even bigger than both of Miss Reba 's yellowish diamonds put together . ( Later I learned  --  no matter how ? that she had had the gold one taken out and an ordinary white one , like anybody else 's , put in ; and I grieved . I thought that , had I been of her race and age group , it would have been worth being her husband just to watch that tooth in action across the table every day ; a child of eleven , it seemed to me that the very food it masticated must taste different , better. )  | Miss Reba turned to Boon again . " What you been doing ? wrassling with hogs ? " " We got in a mudhole back down the road . We drove up . The automobile 's outside now . " " I saw it , " Miss Reba said . " We all did . Do nt tell me it 's yours . Just tell me if the police are after it . If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Binford 's strict about having police around here too . So am I. " " The automobile 's all right , " Boon said . " It better be , " Miss Reba said . She was looking at me again . She said , " Lucius , " not to anybody . " Too bad you did n't get here sooner . Mr Binford likes kids . He still likes them even after he begins to have doubts , and this last week would have raised doubts in anybody that ai nt a ossified corpse . I mean , he was still willing to give Otis the benefit of the doubt to take him to the zoo right after dinner . Lucius could have gone too . But then on the other hand , maybe not . If Otis is still using up doubts at the same rate he was before they left here , he ai nt coming back  --  providing there 's some way to get him up close enough to the cage for one of them lions or tigers to reach him  --  providing a lion or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd ever spent a week in the same house with him . " She was still looking at me . She said , " Lucius , " again , not at anybody . Then she said to Minnie : " Go up and tell everybody to stay out of the bathroom for the next half an hour . " She said to Boon : " You got a change of clothes with you ? " " Yes , " Boon said . " Then wash yourself off and put them on ; this is a decent place : not a joint . Let them use Vera 's room , Minnie . Vera 's visiting her folks up in Paducah . " She said to Boon or maybe to both of us : " Minnie fixed a bed for Otis up in the attic . Lucius can sleep with him tonight ? " There were feet on the stairs , then in the hall and in  | the door . This time it was a big girl . I do nt mean fat : just big , like Boon was big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark hair and blue eyes and at first I thought her face was plain . But she came into the room already looking at me , and I knew it did n't matter what her face was . " Hi , kiddo , " Boon said . But she did n't pay any attention to him at all yet ; she and Miss Reba were both looking at me . " Watch now , " Miss Reba said . " Lucius , this is Miss Corrie . " I made my manners again . " See what I mean ? " Miss Reba said . " You brought that nephew of yours over here hunting refinement . Here it is , waiting for him . He wont know what it means , let alone why he 's doing it . But maybe Lucius could learn him to at least ape it . All right , " she said to Boon . " Go get cleaned up . " " Maybe Corrie 'll come help us , " Boon said . He was holding Miss Corrie 's hand . " Hi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a shanty-boat swamp rat , " Miss Reba said . " I 'll keep this damned place respectable on Sunday anyhow . " " Minnie showed us where the room and the bathroom were upstairs and gave us soap and a towel apiece and went out . Boon put his grip on the bed and opened it and took out a clean shirt and his other pants . They were his everyday pants but the Sunday ones he had on would n't be fit to wear anywhere until they were cleaned with naphtha probably . " You see ? " he said . " I told you so . I done the best I could to make you bring at least a clean shirt . " " My blouse ai nt muddy , " I said . " But you ought to have a fresh one just on principle to put on after you bathe . " " I ai nt going to bathe , " I said . " I had a bath yesterday . " " So did I , " he said . " But you heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " I heard her , " I said . " I never knew any ladies anywhere that was n't trying to make somebody take a bath . " " By the time you 've known Miss Reba a few hours longer , you 'll find out you done learned something else about ladies too : that when she suggests you to do something , it 's a good idea to do it while you 're still deciding whether you 're going to or not . " He had already unpacked his other pants and shirt . It does n't take long to unpack one pair of pants and one shirt from one grip , but he seemed to be having trouble , mainly about putting them down after he took them out , not looking at me , bending over the open grip , busy , holding the shirt in his hand while he decided where to put the pants , then putting the shirt on the bed and picking up the pants again and moving them about a foot further along the bed , then picking up the shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he cleared his throat loud and hard and went to the window and opened it and leaned out and spit and closed the window and came back to the bed , not looking at me , talking loud , like somebody that comes upstairs first on Christmas morning and tells you what you 're going to get on the Christmas tree that 's not the thing you wrote Santa Claus for : " Do nt it beat all how much a fellow can learn and in what a short time , about something he not only never knowed before , he never even had no idea he would ever want to know it , let alone would find it useful to him for the rest of his life  --  providing he kept it , never let it get away from him . Take you , for instance . Just think . Here it ai nt but yesterday morning , not even two days back yet , and think how much you have learned : how to drive a automobile , how to go to Memphis across the country without depending on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a mudhole . So that when you get big and own a automobile of your own , you will not  | only already know how to drive it but the road to Memphis too and even how to get it out of a mudhole . " " Boss says that when I get old enough to own an automobile , there wont be any more mudholes to get into . That all the roads everywhere will be so smooth and hard that automobiles will be foreclosed and reclaimed by the bank or even wear out without ever seeing a mudhole . " " Sure , sure , " Boon said , " all right , all right . Say there ai nt no more need to know how to get out of a mudhole , at least you 'll still know how to . Because why ? Because you ai nt give the knowing how away to nobody . " " " Who could I give it to ? " I said . " Who would want to know how , if there ai nt any more mudholes ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Just listen to me a minute , will you ? I ai nt talking about mudholes . I 'm talking about the things a fellow  --  boy can learn that he never even thought about before , that forever afterward , when he needs them he will already have them . Because there ai nt nothing you ever learn that the day wont come when you 'll need it or find use for it  --  providing you 've still got it , ai nt let it get away from you by chance or , worse than that , give it away from carelessness or pure and simple bad judgment . Do you see what I mean now ? Is that clear ? " " I do nt know , " I said . " It must be , or you could n't keep on talking about it . " " All right , " he said . " That 's point number one . Now for point number two . Me and you have been good friends as long as we have known each other , we 're having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few things you never seen nor heard of before , and I 'm proud to be the one to be along and help you learn them . And tonight you 're fixing to learn some more things I do nt think you have thought about before neither  --  things and  | information and doings that a lot of folks in Jefferson and other places too will try to claim you ai nt old enough yet to be bothered with knowing about them . But shucks , a boy that not only learned to run a automobile but how to drive it to Memphis and get it out of that son of a bitch 's private mudhole too , all in one day , is plenty old enough to handle anything he 'll meet . Only ? " He had to cough again , hard , and clear his throat and then go to the window and open it and spit again and close it again . Then he came back . " And that 's point number three . That 's what I 'm trying to impress on you . Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hears about , even if he do nt understand it at the time and cant even imagine he will ever have any use to know it , some day he will have a use for it and will need it , providing he has still got it and ai nt give it away to nobody . And then he will thank his stars for the good friend that has been his friend since he had to be toted around that livery stable on his back like a baby and held him on the first horse he ever rode , that warned him in time not to throw it away and lose it for good by forgetfulness or accident or mischance or maybe even just friendly blabbing about what ai nt nobody else 's business but theirs ? " " What you mean is , whatever I see on this trip up here , not to tell Boss or Father or Mother or Grandmother when we get back home . Is that it ? " " Do nt you agree ? " Boon said . " Ai nt that not a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's business but yours and mine ? Do nt you agree ? " " Then why did n't you just come right out and say so ? " I said . Only he still remembered to make inc take another bath ; the bathroom smelled even more . I do nt mean stronger : I just mean more . I did n't know much about boarding houses , so maybe they could have one with just  | ladies in it . I asked Boon ; we were on the way back downstairs then ; it was beginning to get dark and I was hungry . " You damn right they 're ladies , " he said . " If I so much as catch you trying to show any sass to any of them ? " " I mean , do nt any men board here ? live here ? " " No . Do nt no men actively live here except Mr Binford , and there ai nt no boarding to speak of neither . But they have plenty of company here , in and out after supper and later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday night , and Mr Binford is pretty strict about Sunday : no dancing and frolicking : just visiting their particular friends quiet and polite and not wasting too much time , and Mr Binford sees to it they damn sure better keep on being quiet and polite while they are here . In fact , he 's a good deal that way even on week nights . Which reminds me . All you need to do is be quiet and polite yourself and enjoy yourself and listen good in case he he do nt never like it when somebody makes him have to talk twice . This way . They 're likely in Miss Reba 's room . " They were : Miss Reba , Miss Corrie , Mr Binford and Otis . Miss Reba had on a black dress now , and three more diamonds , yellowing too . Mr Binford was little , the littlest one in the room above Otis and me . He had on a black Sunday suit and gold studs and a big gold watch chain and a heavy moustache , and a gold-headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the table at his elbow . But the first thing you noticed about him was his eyes because the first thing you found out was that he was already looking at you . Otis had his Sunday clothes on too . He was not even as big as me but there was something wrong about him . " Evening , Boon , " Mr Binford said .  | " Evening , Mr Binford , " Boon said . " This is a friend of mine . Lucius Priest . " But when I made my manners to him , he did n't say anything at all . He just quit looking at me . " Reba , " he said , " buy Boon and Corrie a drink . Tell Minnie to make these boys some lemonade . " " Minnie 's putting supper on , " Miss Reba said . She unlocked the closet door . It had a kind of bar in it  --  one shelf with glasses , another with bottles . " Besides , that one of Corrie 's do nt want lemonade no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it , " Mr Binford said . " He slipped away from me out at the park . He would have made it only he could n't find anybody to go into the saloon for him . Is yours a beer-head too , Boon ? " " No sir , " I said . " I do nt drink beer . " " Why ? " Mr Binford said . " You do nt like it or you cant get it ? " " No sir , " I said . " I 'm not old enough yet . " " Whiskey , then ? " Mr Binford said . " No sir , " I said . " I do nt drink anything . I promised my mother I would n't unless Father or Boss invited me . " " Who 's his boss ? " Mr Binford said to Boon . " He means his grandfather , " Boon said . " Oh , " Mr Binford said . " The one that owns the automobile . So evidently nobody promised him anything . " " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells you what to do and you do it . " " You sound like you call him boss too , " Mr Binford said . " Sometimes . " " That 's right , " Boon said . That 's what I meant about Mr Binford : he was already looking at me before I even knew it . " But your mother 's not here now , " he said . " You 're on a tear with Boon now . Eighty  --  is it ? ? miles away . " " No sir , " I said . " I promised her . "  | " I see , " Mr Binford said . " You just promised her you would n't drink with Boon . You did n't promise not to go whore-hopping with him . " " You son of a bitch , " Miss Reba said . I do nt know how to say it . Without moving , she and Miss Corrie jumped , sprang , confederated , Miss Reba with the whiskey bottle in one hand and three glasses in the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Like hell , " Miss Reba said . " I can throw you out too . Do nt think I wont . What the hell kind of language is that ? " " And you too ! " Miss Corrie said ; she was talking at Miss Reba . " You 're just as bad ! Right in front of them ? " " I said , that 'll do , " Mr Binford said . " One of them cant get beer and the other do nt drink it so maybe they both just come here for refinement and education . Call it they just got some . They just learned that whore and son of a bitch are both words to think twice before pulling the trigger on because both of them can backfire . " " Aw , come on , Mr Binford , " Boon said . " Why , be damned if here ai nt still another hog in this wallow , " Mr Binford said . " A big one , too . Wake up , Miss Reba , before these folks suffocate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand shaking , enough to clink the bottle against the glass , saying son of a bitch . son of a bitch . son of a bitch . in a thick fierce whisper . " That 's better , " Mr Binford said . " Let 's have peace around here . Let 's drink to it . " He raised his glass and was saying , " Ladies and gents all , " when somebody  --  Minnie I suppose  --  began to ring a hand bell somewhere in the back . Mr Binford got up . " That 's better still , " he said . " Hash time . Learn us all the refinement and education that there 's a better use for the mouth than running private opinions through it . " We went back toward the dining room , not fast , Mr  | Binford leading the way . There were feet again , going fast ; two more ladies , girls  --  that is , one of them was still a girl  --  hurried down the stairs , still buttoning their clothes , one in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little . " We hurried as fast as we could , " one of them said quickly to Mr Binford . " We 're not late . " " I 'm glad of that , " Mr Binford said . " I do nt feel like lateness tonight . " We went in . There were more than enough places at the table , even with Otis and me . Minnie was still bringing things , all cold  --  fried chicken and biscuits and vegetables left over from dinner , except Mr Binford 's . His supper was hot : not a plate , a dish of steak smothered in onions at his place . ( You see ? how much ahead of his time Mr Binford was ? Already a Republican . I do nt mean a 1905 Republican  --  I do nt know what his Tennessee politics were , or if he had any ? I mean a 1961 Republican . He was more : he was a Conservative . Like this : a Republican is a man who made his money ; a Liberal is a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cross-country race ; a Conservative is a Republican who has learned to read and write . ) We all sat down , the two new ladies too ; I had met so many people by now that I could n't get names any more and had stopped trying ; besides , I never saw these two again . We began to eat . Maybe the reason Mr Binford 's steak smelled so extra was that the rest of the food had smelled itself out at noon . Then one of the new ladies  --  the one who was no longer a girl  --  said , " Were we , Mr Binford ? " Now the other one , the girl , had stopped eating too . " Were you what ? " Mr Binford said . " You know what , " the girl said , cried . " Miss Reba , " she said , " you know we do the best we can  --  do nt dare make no extra noise  --  no music on Sunday when all the other places do  --  always shushing our customers up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra fun  --  but if we ai nt already setting down at our places in this dining room when he sticks his nose in the door , next Saturday we got to drop twenty-five cents into that God damned box ? " " They are house rules , " Mr Binford said . " A house without rules is not a house . The trouble with you bitches is , you have to act like ladies some of the time but you do nt know how . I 'm learning you how . " " You cant talk to me that way , " the older one said . " All right , " Mr Binford said . " We 'll turn it around . The trouble with you ladies is , you do nt know how to quit acting like bitches . " The older one was standing now . There was something wrong about her too . It was n't that she was old , like Grandmother is old , because she was n't . She was alone . It was just that she should n't have had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . No , that 's wrong too . It 's that nobody should ever have to be that alone , nobody , not ever . She said , " I 'm sorry , Miss Reba . I 'm going to move out . Tonight . " " Where ? " Mr Binford said . " Across the street to Birdie Watts 's ? Maybe she 'll let you bring your trunk back with you this time  --  unless she 's already sold it . " " Miss Reba , " the woman said quietly . " Miss Reba . " " All right , " Miss Reba said briskly . " Sit down and eat your supper ; you ai nt going nowhere . Yes , " she said , " I like peace too . So I 'm going to mention just one more thing , then we 'll close this subject for good . " She was talking up the table at Mr Binford now . " What the hell 's wrong with you ? What the hell happened this afternoon to get you into this God damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Binford said . " That 's right , " Otis said suddenly . " Nothing sure did n't happen . He would n't even run " There was something , like a quick touch of electricity ; Miss Reba was sitting  | with her mouth open and her fork halfway in it . I did n't understand yet but everybody else , even Boon , did . And in the next minute I did too . " Who would n't run ? " Miss Reba said . " The horse , " Otis said . " The horse and buggy we bet on in the race . Did they , Mr Binford ? " Now the silence was no longer merely electric : it was shocked , electrocuted . Remember I told you there was something wrong somewhere about Otis . Though I still did n't think this was quite it , or at least all of it . But Miss Reba was still fighting . Because women are wonderful . They can bear anything because they are wise enough to know that all you have to do with grief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on the other side . I think they can do this because they not only decline to dignify physical pain by taking it seriously , they have no sense of shame at the idea of being knocked out . She did n't quit , even then . " A horse race , " she said . " At the zoo ? in Overton Park ? " " Not Overton Park , " Otis said . " The driving park . We met a man on the streetcar that knowed which horse and buggy was going to win , and changed our mind about Overton Park . Only , they did n't win , did they , Mr Binford ? But even then , we never lost as much as the man did , we did n't even lose forty dollars because Mr Binford give me twenty-five cents of it not to tell , so all we lost was just thirty-nine dollars and seventy-five cents . Only , on top of that , my twenty-five cents got away from me in that beer mix-up Mr Binford was telling about . Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more silence . It was quite peaceful . Then Miss Reba said , " You son of a bitch . " Then she said , " Go on . Finish your steak first if you want . " And Mr Binford was n't a quitter either . He was proud too : that gave no quarter and accepted none , like a gamecock . He crossed his  | knife and fork neatly and without haste on the steak he had barely cut into yet ; he even folded his napkin and pushed it back through the ring and got up and said , " Excuse me , all , " and went out , looking at nobody , not even Otis . " Well , Jesus , " the younger of the two late ones , the girl , said ; it was then I noticed Minnie standing in the half-open kitchen door . " What do you know ? " " Get to hell out of here , " Miss Reba said to the girl . " Both of you . " The girl and the woman rose quickly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl said . " No , " Miss Corrie said . " Just get out of here . If you 're not expecting anybody in the next few minutes , why do nt you take a walk around the block or something ? " They did n't waste any time either . Miss Corrie got up . " You too , " she told Otis . " Go upstairs to your room and stay there . " " He 'll have to pass Miss Reba 's door to do that , " Boon said . " Have you forgot about that quarter ? " " It was more than a quarter , " Otis said . " There was them eighty-five cents I made pumping the pee a noler for them to dance Saturday night . When he found out about the beer , he taken that away from me too . " But Miss Reba looked at him . " So you sold him out for eighty-five cents , " she said . " Go to the kitchen , " Miss Corrie told Otis . " Let him come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minnie said . " I 'll try to keep him out of the icebox . But he 's too fast for me . " " Hell , let him stay here , " Miss Reba said . " It 's too late now . He should have been sent somewhere else before he ever got off that Arkansas train last week . " Miss Corrie went to the chair next to Miss Reba . " Why do nt you go and help him pack ? " she said , quite gently .  | " Who the hell are you accusing ? " Miss Reba said . " I will trust him with every penny I 've got . Except for those God damn horses . " She stood up suddenly , with her trim rich body and the hard handsome face and the hair that was too richly red . " Why the hell cant I do without him ? " she said . " Why the hell cant I ? " " Now , now , " Miss Corrie said . " You need a drink . Give Minnie the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet ? " " He gone , " Minnie said . " I heard the front door . It do nt take him long . It never do . " " That 's right , " Miss Reba said . " Me and Minnie have been here before , have n't we , Minnie ? " She gave Minnie the keys and sat down and Minnie went out and came back with a bottle of gin this time and they all had a glass of gin , Minnie too ( though she declined to drink with this many white people at once , each time carrying her full glass back to the kitchen then reappearing a moment later with the glass empty ) , except Otis and me . And so I found out about Mr Binford . He was the landlord . That was his official even if unwritten title and designation . All places , houses like this , had one , had to have one . In the alien outside world fortunate enough not to have to make a living in this hard and doomed and self-destroying way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But here , the lone male not even in a simple household of women but in a hysteria of them , he was not just lord but the unthanked and thankless catalyst , the single frail power wearing the shape of respectability sufficient to compel enough of order on the hysteria to keep the unit solvent or anyway eating  --  he was the agent who counted down the money and took the receipt for the taxes and utilities , who dealt with the tradesmen from the liquor dealers through the grocers and coal merchants , down through the plumbers who thawed the frozen pipes in winter and the casual  | labor which cleaned the chimneys and gutters and cut the weeds out of the yard ; his was the hand which paid the blackmail to the law ; it was his voice which fought the losing battles with the street- and assessment-commissioners and cursed the newspaper boy the day after the paper was n't delivered . And of these ( I mean , landlords ) in this society , Mr Binford was the prince and paragon : a man of style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , impeccable in morals , more faithful than many husbands during the whole five years he had been Miss Reba 's lover : whose sole and only vice was horses running in competition on which bets could be placed . This he could not resist ; he knew it was his weakness and he fought against it . But each time , at the cry of " They 're off ! " he was putty in the hands of any stranger with a dollar to bet . " He knowed it his-self , " Minnie said . " He was ashamed of his-self and for his-self both , for being so weak , of there being anything bigger than him ; to find out he ai nt bigger than anything he could meet up with , he do nt care where nor what , even if on the outside , to folks that did n't know him , he just looked like a banty rooster . So he would promise us and mean it , like he done that time two years ago when we finally had to throw him out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him back that time , " she told Miss Reba . " I remember , " Miss Reba said . " Pour another round . " " I do nt know how he 'll manage it , " Minnie said . " Because when he leaves , he do nt take nothing but his clothes , I mean , just the ones he 's got on since it was Miss Reba 's money that paid for them . But wont two days pass before a messenger will be knocking on the door with every cent of them forty dollars ? " " You mean thirty-nine , six bits , " Boon said . " No , " Minnie said . " Every one of them forty dollars ,  | even that quarter , was Miss Reba 's . He wont be satisfied less . Then Miss Reba will send for him and he wont come ; last year when we finally found him he was working in a gang laying a sewer line way down past the Frisco depot until she had to beg him right down on her bended knee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Stop running your mouth long enough to pour the gin , anyway . " Minnie began to pour . Then she stopped , the bottle suspended . " What 's that hollering ? " she said . Now we all heard it ? a faint bawling from somewhere toward the back . " Go and see , " Miss Reba said . " Here , give me the bottle . " Minnie gave her the bottle and went back to the kitchen . Miss Reba poured and passed the bottle . " He 's two years older now , " Miss Corrie said . " He 'll have more sense ? " " What 's he saving it for ? " Miss Reba said . " Go on . Pass it . " Minnie came back . She said : " Man standing in the back yard hollering Mr Boon Hogganbeck at the back wall of the house . He got something big with him . " We ran , following Boon , through the kitchen and out onto the back gallery . It was quite dark now ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . Two dim things , a little one and a big one , were standing in the middle of the back yard , the little one bawling " Boon Hogganbeck ! Mister Boon Hogganbeck ! Hellaw . Hellaw " toward the upstairs windows until Boon overrode him by simple volume : " Shut up ! Shut up ! Shut up ! " It was Ned . What he had with him was a horse .  | We were all in the kitchen . " Good Godalmighty , " Boon said . " You swapped Boss 's automobile for a horse ? " He had to say it twice even . Because Ned was still looking at Minnie 's tooth . I mean , he was waiting for it again . Maybe Miss Reba had said something to her or maybe Minnie had spoken herself . What I do remember is the rich instantaneous glint of gold out of the middle of whatever Minnie said , in the electric light of the kitchen , as if the tooth itself had gained a new luster , lambence from the softer light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes had  --  this , and its effect on Ned . It had stopped him cold for that moment , instant , like basilisk . So had it stopped me when I first saw it , so I knew what Ned was experiencing . Only his was more so . Because I realised this dimly too , even at only eleven :  | that I was too far asunder , not merely in race but in age , to feel what Ned felt ; I could only be awed , astonished and pleased by it ; I could not , like Ned , participate in that tooth . Here , in the ancient battle of the sexes , was a foeman worthy of his steel ; in the ancient mystic solidarity of race , here was a high priestess worth dying for  --  if such was your capacity for devotion : which , it was soon obvious , was not what Ned intended ( anyway hoped ) to do with Minnie . So Boon had to repeat before Ned heard  --  or anyway noticed  --  him . " You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boss do nt want no automobile . He bought that thing because he had to , because Colonel Sartoris made him . He had to buy that automobile to put Colonel Sartoris back in his place he had done upstarted from . What Boss likes is a horse  --  and I do nt mean none of these high-named harness plugs you and Mr Maury has in that livery stable : but a horse . And I got him one . The minute he sees this horse , he 's gonter say right down much oblige to me just for being where I could get a-holt of it before somebody else done it ? " It was like a dream , a nightmare ; you know it is , and if you can only touch something hard , real , actual , unaltered , you can wake yourself ; Boon and I had the same idea , instantaneous : I moved quicker only because there was less of me to put in motion . Ned stopped us ; he read two minds : " No need to go look , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Boon , frozen in midstride , glared at me , the two of us mutual in one horrified unbelief while I fumbled in my pocket . But the switch key was there . " Sho , " Ned said , " he never needed that thing . He was a expert . He claimed he knowed how to reach his hand in behind the lock and turn it on from the back . He done it , too . I did n't believe it neither , until I seen it . It never give him no trouble a-tall . He even throwed in the halter with the horse ? "  | We  --  Boon and I  --  were not running , but fast enough , Miss Reba and Miss Corrie too , to the front door . The automobile was gone . That was when I realised that Miss Reba and Miss Corrie were there too , and that they had said nothing whatever themselves  --  no surprise , shock ; watching and listening , not missing any part of it but not saying anything at all , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind , from Boon and me and Ned and Grandfather 's automobile and the horse ( whoever it belonged to ) and had no concern with us and our doings but entertainment ; and I remembered how that was exactly the way Mother would watch me and my brothers and whatever neighborhood boys were involved , not missing anything , quite constant and quite dependable , even warmly so , bright and kind but insulate until the moment , the need arrived to abolish the bone and ( when necessary ) stanch the consequent blood . We went back to the kitchen , where we had left Ned and Minnie . We could already hear Ned : " ? money you talking about , Good-looking , I got it or I can get it . Lemme get this horse put up and fed and me and you gonter step out and let that tooth do its shining amongst something good enough to match it , like a dish of catfish or maybe hog meat if it likes hog meat better ? " " All right , " Boon said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live ? " " Which man ? " Ned said . " What you want with him ? " " To get Boss 's automobile back . I 'll decide then whether to send you to jail here or take you back to Jefferson and let Boss have the fun . " " Why n't you stop talking a minute and listen to me ? " Ned said . " In course I knows where the man lives : did n't I just trade a horse from him this evening ? Let him alone . We do nt want him yet . We wont need him until after the race . Because we ai nt just got the horse : he throwed in the horse race too . A man at Possum got a horse waiting  | right this minute to run against him as soon as we get there . In case you ladies do nt know where Possum 's at , it 's where the railroad comes up from Jefferson and crosses the Memphis one where you changes cars unlessen you comes by automobile like we done ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man at Possum ? " " Oh , " Miss Reba said . " Parsham . " " That 's right , " Ned said . " Where they has the bird-dog trials . It ai nt no piece . ? got a horse done already challenged this un to a three-heat race , fifty dollars a heat , winner take all . But that ai nt nothing : just a hundred and fifty dollars . What we gonter do is win back that automobile . " " How ? " Boon said . " How the hell are you going to use the horse to win the automobile back from the man that has already give you the horse for it ? " " Because the man do nt believe the horse can run . Why you think he swapped me as cheap as a automobile ? Why did n't he just keep the horse and win him a automobile of his own , if he wanted one , and have both of them  --  a horse and a automobile too ? " " I 'll bite , " Boon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . This horse done already been beat twice by that Possum horse because never nobody knowed how to make him run . So naturally the man will believe that if the horse would n't run them other two times , he ai nt gonter run this time neither . So all we got to do is , bet him the horse against Boss 's automobile . Which he will be glad to bet because naturally he would n't mind owning the horse back too , long as he 's already got the automobile , especially when it ai nt no more risk than just having to wait at the finish line until the horse finally comes up to where he can catch him and tie him behind the automobile and come on back to Memphis ? "  | This was the first time Miss Reba spoke . She said , " Jesus . " " ? because he do nt believe I can make that horse run neither . But unlessen I done got rusty on my trading and made a mistake I do nt know about , he do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after tomorrow to find out . And if you cant scrap up enough extra boot amongst these ladies here to make him good interested in betting that automobile against it , you better had n't never laid eyes on Boss Priest in your born life . It would have tooken a braver man than me to just took his automobile back to him . But maybe this horse will save you . Because the minute I laid my eyes on that horse , it put me in mind of ? " " Hee hee hee , " Boon said , in that harsh and savage parody . " You give away Boss 's automobile for a horse that cant run , and now you 're fixing to give the horse back providing I can scrape up enough boot to interest him ? " " Let me finish , " Ned said . Boon stopped . " You gonter let me finish ? " Ned said . " Finish then , " Boon said . " And make it ? " " ? put me in mind of a mule I use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped , looking at each other ; we all watched them . After a moment Ned said , gently , almost dreamily : " These ladies was n't acquainted with that mule . Naturally , being young ladies like they is , not to mention so fur away as Yoknapatawpha County . It 's too bad Boss or Mr Maury ai nt here now to tell them about him . " I could have done that . Because the mule was one of our family legends . It was back when Father and Ned were young men , before Grandfather moved in from McCaslin to become a Jefferson banker . One day , during Cousin McCaslin 's ( Cousin Zack 's uncle 's ) absence , Ned  | bred the mare of his matched standard-bred carriage team to the farm jack . When the consequent uproar exhausted itself and the mule colt was foaled , Cousin McCaslin made Ned buy it from him at ten cents a week subtracted from Ned 's wages . It took Ned three years , by which time the mule had consistently beaten every mule matched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now being challenged by mules from forty and fifty , and beating them . You were born too late to be acquainted with mules and so comprehend the startling , the even shocking , import of this statement . A mule which will gallop for a half-mile in the single direction elected by its rider even one time becomes a neighborhood legend ; one that will do it consistently time after time is an incredible phenomenon . Because , unlike a horse , a mule is far too intelligent to break its heart for glory running around the rim of a mile-long saucer . In fact , I rate mules second only to rats in intelligence , the mule followed in order by cats , dogs , and horses last  --  assuming of course that you accept my definition of intelligence : which is the ability to cope with environment : which means to accept environment yet still retain at least something of personal liberty . The rat of course I rate first . He lives in your house without helping you to buy it or build it or repair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you eat without helping you raise it or buy it or even haul it into the house ; you can not get rid of him ; were he not a cannibal , he would long since have inherited the earth . The cat is third , with some of the same qualities but a weaker , punier creature ; he neither toils nor spins , he is a parasite on you but he does not love you ; he would die , cease to exist , vanish from the earth ( I mean , in his so-called domestic form ) but so far he has not had to . ( There is the fable , Chinese  | I think , literary I am sure : of a period on earth when the dominant creatures were cats : who after ages of trying to cope with the anguishes of mortality  --  famine , plague , war , injustice , folly , greed  --  in a word , civilised government  --  convened a congress of the wisest cat philosophers to see if anything could be done : who after long deliberation agreed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only practical solution was to give it up , relinquish , abdicate , by selecting from among the lesser creatures a species , race optimistic enough to believe that the mortal predicament could be solved and ignorant enough never to learn better . Which is why the cat lives with you , is completely dependent on you for food and shelter but lifts no paw for you and loves you not ; in a word , why your cat looks at you the way it does . ) The dog I rate fourth . He is courageous , faithful , monogamous in his devotion ; he is your parasite too : his failure ( as compared to the cat ) is that he will work for you  --  I mean , willingly , gladly , ape any trick , no matter how silly , just to please you , for a pat on the head ; as sound and first-rate a parasite as any , his failure is that he is a sycophant , believing that he has to show gratitude also ; he will debase and violate his own dignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kick , he will give his life for you in battle and grieve himself to starvation over your bones . The horse I rate last . A creature capable of but one idea at a time , his strongest quality is timidity and fear . He can be tricked and cajoled by a child into breaking his limbs or his heart too in running too far too fast or jumping things too wide or hard or high ; he will eat himself to death if not guarded like a baby ; if he had only one gram of the intelligence of the most backward rat , he would be the rider . The mule I rate second . But second only because you  | can make him work for you . But that too only within his own rigid self-set regulations . He will not permit himself to eat too much . He will draw a wagon or a plow , but he will not run a race . He will not try to jump anything he does not indubitably know beforehand he can jump ; he will not enter any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other side ; he will work for you patiently for ten years for the chance to kick you once . In a word , free of the obligations of ancestry and the responsibilities of posterity , he has conquered not only life but death too and hence is immortal ; were he to vanish from the earth today , the same chanceful biological combination which produced him yesterday would produce him a thousand years hence , unaltered , unchanged , incorrigible still within the limitations which he himself had proved and tested ; still free , still coping . Which is why Ned 's mule was unique , a phenomenon . Put a dozen mules on a track and when the word Go is given , a dozen different directions will be taken , like a scattering of disturbed bugs on the surface of a pond ; the one of the twelve whose direction happens to coincide with the track , will inevitably win . But not Ned 's mule . Father said it ran like a horse , but without the horse 's frantic frenzy , the starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It ran a race like a job : it sprang into what it had already calculated would be the exact necessary speed at Ned 's touch ( or voice or whatever his signal was ) and that speed never altered until it crossed the finish line and Ned stopped it . And nobody , not even Father  --  who was Ned 's , well , not groom exactly but rather his second and betting agent  --  knew just what Ned did to it . Naturally the legend of that grew and mounted ( doing no harm to their stable either ) also . I mean , of just what magic Ned had found or invented to make the mule run  | completely unlike any known mule . But they  --  wenever learned what it was , nor did anybody else ever ride as its jockey , even after Ned began to put on years and weight , until the mule died , unbeaten at twenty-two years of age ; its grave ( any number of Edmondses have certainly already shown it to you ) is out there at McCaslin now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ned knew he knew it . They stared at each other . " This ai nt that mule , " Boon said . " This is a horse . " " This horse got the same kind of sense that mule had , " Ned said . " He ai nt got as much of it but it 's the same kind . " They stared at each other . Then Boon said , " Let 's go look at him . " Minnie lighted a lamp . With Boon carrying it , we all went out to the back porch and into the yard , Minnie and Miss Corrie and Miss Reba too . The moon was just getting up now and we could see a little . The horse was tied beneath a locust tree in the corner . Its eyes glowed , then flashed away ; it snorted and we could hear one nervous foot . " You ladies kindly stand back a minute , please , " Ned said . " He ai nt used to much society yet . " We stopped , Boon holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again as Ned walked toward it , talking to it until he could touch its shoulder , stroking it , still talking to it until he had the halter in his hand . " Now , do nt run that lamp at him , " he told Boon . " Just walk up and hold the light where the ladies can see a horse if they wants to . And when I says horse , I means horse . Not them plugs they calls horses back yonder in Jefferson . " " Stop talking and bring him out where we can see him , " Boon said . " You 're looking at him now , " Ned said . " Hold the lamp up . " Nevertheless he brought the horse out and moved him a little . Oh yes , I remember him : a three-year-old  | three-quarters-bred ( at least , maybe more : I was n't expert enough to tell ) chestnut gelding , not large , not even sixteen hands , but with the long neck for balance and the laid-back shoulders for speed and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ned McCaslin for heart and will ) . So that even at only eleven , I believe I was thinking exactly what Boon proved a moment later that he was . He looked at the horse . Then he looked at Ned . But when he spoke his voice was no more than a murmur : " This horse is ? " " Wait , " Miss Corrie said . That 's right . I had n't even noticed Otis . That was something else about him : when you noticed him , it was just a second before it would have been too late . But that was still not what was wrong about him . " God , yes , " Miss Reba said . I tell you , women are wonderful . " Get out of here , " she told Otis . " Go in the house , Otis , " Miss Corrie said . " You bet , " Otis said . " Come on , Lucius . " " No , " Miss Corrie said . " Just you . Go on now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's early yet , " Otis said . " I ai nt sleepy neither . " " I ai nt going to tell you twice , " Miss Reba said . Boon waited until Otis was in the house . We all did , Boon holding the lamp high so its light fell mostly on his and Ned 's faces , speaking again in that heatless monotone , he and Ned both : " This horse is stolen , " Boon murmured . " What would you call that automobile ? " Ned murmured . Yes , wonderful ; Miss Reba 's tone was no more than Boon 's and Ned 's : only brisker : " You got to get it out of town . " " That 's just exactly the idea I brought him here with , "  | Ned said . " Soon as I eats my supper , me and him gonter start for Possum . " " Have you got any idea how far it is to Possum , let alone in what direction ? " Boon said . " Does it matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without taking that automobile with him right in his hand , did your mind worry you about how far Memphis was ? " Miss Reba moved . " Come in the house , " she said . " Can anybody see him here ? " she said to Ned . " Nome , " Ned said . " I got that much sense . I done already seen to that . " He tied the horse to the tree again and we followed Miss Reba up the back steps . " The kitchen , " she said . " It 's getting time for company to start coming in . " In the kitchen she said to Minnie : " Sit in my room where you can answer the door . Did you give me the keys back or have you ? All right . Do nt give no credit to anybody unless you know them ; make the change before you even pull the cork if you can . See who 's in the house now too . If anybody asks for Miss Corrie , just say her friend from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them do nt believe you , tell them to come around the alley and knock on the back door , " Boon said . " For Christ 's sake , " Miss Reba said . " Have n't you got troubles enough already to keep you busy ? If you do nt want Corrie having company , why the hell do nt you buy her outright instead of just renting her once every six months ? " " All right , all right , " Boon said . " And see where everybody in the house is , too , " Miss Reba told Minnie . " I 'll see about him , myself , " Miss Corrie said . " Make him stay there , " Miss Reba said . " He 's already played all the hell with horses I 'm going to put up with in one day . " Miss Corrie went out . Miss Reba went herself  | and closed the door and stood looking at Ned . " You mean , you were going to walk to Parsham and lead that horse ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you know how far it is to Parsham ? " " Do it matter ? " Ned said again . " I do nt need to know how far it is to Possum . All I needs is Possum . That 's why I changed my mind about leading him : it might be far . At first I thought , being as you 're in the connection busi-ness ? " " What the hell do you mean ? " Miss Reba said . " I run a house . Anybody that 's too polite to call it that , I do nt want in my front door or back door neither . " " I mean , one of your ladies ' connections , " Ned said . " That might have a saddle horse or even a plow horse or even a mule I could ride whilst Lucius rides the colt , and go to Possum that way . But we ai nt only got to run a solid mile the day after tomorrow , we got to do it three times and at least two of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I 'm gonter walk him to Possum . " " All right , " Miss Reba said . " You and the horse are in Parsham . All you need now is a horse race . " " Any man with a horse can find a horse race anywhere , " Ned said . " All he needs is for both of them to be able to stand up long enough to start . " " Can you make this one stand up that long ? " " That 's right , " Ned said . " Can you make him run while he 's standing up ? " " That 's right , " Ned said . " How do you know you can ? " " I made that mule run , " Ned said . " What mule ? " Miss Reba said . Miss Corrie came in , shutting the door behind her . " Shut it good , " Miss Reba said . She said to Ned : " All right . Tell me about that race . " Now Ned looked at her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoiled immune privileged-retainer impudence of his relations with Boon and the avuncular bossiness of those with me , were completely gone . " You sounds like you want to talk sense for a while , " he said . " Try me , " Miss Reba said . " All right , " Ned said . " A man , another rich white man , I do nt call his name but I can find him ; ai nt but one horse like that in twenty miles of Possum , let alone ten  --  owns a blood horse too that has already run twice against this horse last winter and beat him twice . That Possum horse beat this horse just enough bad the first time , for the other rich white man that owned this horse to bet twice as much the second time . And got beat just enough more bad that second time , that when this horse turns up in Possum day after tomorrow , wanting to run him another race , that Possum rich white man wont be just willing to run his horse again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money . " " All right , " Miss Reba said . " Go on . " " That 's all , " Ned said . " I can make this horse run . Only do nt nobody but me know it yet . So just in case you ladies would like to make up a little jackpot , me and Lucius and Mr Hogganbeck can take that along with us too . " " That includes the one that 's got that automobile now too ? " Miss Reba said . " I mean , among the ones that do nt know you can make it run ? " " That 's right , " Ned said . " Then why did n't he save everybody trouble and send you and the horse both to Parsham , since he believes all he 's got to do to have the horse and the automobile both , is to run that race ? " Now there was no sound ; they just looked at each other . " Come on , " Miss Reba said . " You got to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ned William McCaslin Jefferson Missippi , " Ned said . " Well ? " Miss Reba said . " Maybe he could n't afford it , " Ned said . " Hell , " Boon said . " Neither have we ? " " Shut up , " Miss Reba said to Boon . She said to Ned : " I thought you said he was rich . " " I 'm talking about the one I swapped with , " ' Ned said . " Did he buy the horse from the rich one ? " " He had the horse , " Ned said . " Did he give you a paper of any kind when you swapped ? " " I got the horse , " Ned said . " You cant read , " Miss Reba said . " Can you ? " " I got the horse , " Ned said . Miss Reba stared at him . " You 've got the horse . You 've got him to Parsham . You say you got a system that will make him run . Will the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Use your sense , " Ned said . " You got plenty of it . You done already seen more and seen it quicker than anybody else here . Just look a little harder and see that them folks I swapped that horse from ? " " Them ? " Miss Reba said . " You said a man . " But Ned had n't even stopped : " ? is in exactly the same fix we is : they got to go back home sometime too sooner or later . " " Whether his name is Ned William McCaslin or Boon Hogganbeck or whether it 's them folks I swapped the horse from , to go back home with just the horse or just the automobile ai nt going to be enough : he 's got to have both of them . Is that it ? " Miss Reba said . " Not near enough , " Ned said . " Ai nt that what I been trying to tell you for two hours now ? " Miss Reba stared at Ned . She breathed quietly , once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parsham , with  | every cop in west Tennessee snuffing every road out of Memphis for horse ? " " Reba ! " Miss Corrie said . " ? by daylight tomorrow morning . " " That 's right , " Ned said . " It 's long past too late for nobody to get caught now . But you doing all right . You doing fine . You tell me . " She was looking at him ; she breathed twice this time ; she did n't even move her eyes when she spoke to Miss Corrie : " That brakeman ? " " What brakeman ? " Miss Corrie said . " You know the one I mean . That his mother 's uncle or cousin or something " He 's not a brakeman , " Miss Corrie said . " He 's a flagman . On the Memphis Special , to New York . He wears a uniform too , just like the conductor ? " " All right , " Miss Reba said . " Flagman . " Now she was talking to Boon : " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ned a moment . " Connections . Maybe I like that word of yours , after all . ? His mother 's uncle or something is vice president or something of the railroad that goes through Parsham ? " " His uncle is division superintendent , " Miss Corrie said . " Division superintendent , " Miss Reba said . " That is , between the times when he 's out at the driving park here or in any of the other towns his trains go through where he can watch horse races while his nephew is working his way up from the bottom with the silver spoon already in his mouth as long as he do nt bite down on it hard enough to draw too much notice . See what I mean ? " " The baggage car , " Boon said . " Right , " Miss Reba said . " Then they 'll be in Parsham and already out of sight by daylight tomorrow . " " Even with the baggage car , it will still cost money , " Boon said . " Then to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put up a hundred and fifty for the race itself and all I got is fifteen or twenty dollars . " He rose . " Go get that horse , " he told Ned . " Where did you say the man you gave that automobile lives ? " " Sit down , " Miss Reba said . " Jesus , the trouble you 're already in when you get back to Jefferson , and you still got time to count pennies . " She looked at Ned . " What did you say your name was ? " Ned told her again . " You wants to know about that mule . Ask Boon Hogganbeck about him . " " Do nt you ever make him call you mister ? " she said to Boon . " I always does , " Ned said . " Mister Boon Hogganbeck . Ask him about that mule . " She turned to Miss Corrie . " Is Sam in town tonight ? " " Yes , " Miss Corrie said . " Can you get hold of him now ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to Boon . " You get out of here . Take a walk for a couple of hours . Or go over to Birdie Watts 's if you want . Only , for Christ 's sake do nt get drunk . What the hell do you think Corrie eats and pays her rent with while you 're down there in that Missippi swamp stealing automobiles and kidnapping children ? air ? " " I ai nt going nowhere , " Boon said . " God damn it , " he said to Ned , " go get that horse . " " I do nt need to entertain him , " Miss Corrie said . " I can use the telephone . " It was not smug nor coy : it was just serene . She was much too big a girl , there was much too much of her , for smugness or coyness . But she was exactly right for serenity . " You sure ? " Miss Reba said . " Yes , " Miss Corrie said . " Then get at it , " Miss Reba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Corrie stopped . " Come  | here , I said , " Boon said . She approached then , just outside Boon 's reach ; I noticed suddenly that she was n't looking at Boon at all : she was looking at me . Which was perhaps why Boon , still sitting , was able to reach suddenly and catch her arm before she could evade him , drawing her toward him , she struggling belatedly , as a girl that big would have to , still watching me . " Turn loose , " she said . " I 've got to telephone . " " Sure , sure , " Boon said , " plenty of time for that , " drawing her on ; until , with that counterfeit composure , that desperate willing to look at once forceful and harmless , with which you toss the apple in your hand ( or any other piece of momentary distraction ) toward the bull you suddenly find is also on your side of the fence , she leaned briskly down and kissed him , pecked him quickly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But again too late , his hand dropping and already gripping one cheek of her bottom , in sight of us all , she straining back and looking at me again with something dark and beseeching in her eyes  --  shame , grief , I do n't know what ? while the blood rushed slowly into her big girl 's face that was not really plain at all except at first . But only a moment ; she was still going to be a lady . She even struggled like a lady . But she was simply too big , too strong for even anyone as big and strong as Boon to hold with just one hand , with no more grip than that ; she was free . " Ai nt you ashamed of yourself , " she said . " Cant you save that long enough for her to make one telephone call even ? " Miss Reba said to Boon . " If you 're going to run fevers over her purity , why the hell do nt you set her up in a place of her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then to Miss Corrie : " Go on and telephone . It 's already nine oclock . " Already late for all we had to do . The place had begun  | to wake up ? " jumping , " as you say nowadays . But decorously : no uproar either musical or simply convivial ; Mr Binford 's ghost still reigned , still adumbrated his callipygian grottoes since only two of the ladies actually knew he was gone and the customers had not missed him yet ; we had heard the bell and Minnie 's voice faintly at the front door and the footsteps of the descending nymphs themselves had penetrated from the stairs ; and even as Miss Corrie stood with the knob in her hand , the chink of glasses interspersed in orderly frequence the bass rumble of the entertained and the shriller pipes of their entertainers beyond the door she opened and went through and then closed again . Then Minnie came back too ; it seems that the unoccupied ladies would take turnabout as receptionists during the emergency . You see how indeed the child is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also . Back there in Jefferson I had thought that the reason corruption , Non-virtue , had met so puny a foeman in me as to be not even worthy of the name , was because of my tenderness and youth 's concomitant innocence . But that victory at least required the three hours between the moment I learned of Grandfather Lessep 's death and that one when the train began to move and I realised that Boon would be in unchallenged possession of the key to Grandfather 's automobile for at least four days . While here were Miss Reba and Miss Corrie : foemen you would say already toughened , even if not wisened , by constant daily experience to any wile or assault Non-virtue ( or Virtue ) might invent against them , already sacked and pillaged : who thirty minutes before did n't even know that Ned existed , let alone the horse . Not to mention the complete stranger whom Miss Corrie had just left the room tranquilly confident to conquer with no other weapon than the telephone .  | She had been gone nearly two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the back porch ; I noticed that Ned was not in the room either . " Minnie , " Miss Reba said toward the back door , " was any of that chicken ? " " Yessum , " Minnie said . " I already fixed him a plate . He setting down to it now . " Ned said something . We could n't hear it . But we could hear Minnie : " If all you got to depend on for appetite is me , you gonter starve twice between here and morning . " We could n't hear Ned . Now Miss Corrie had been gone almost four minutes . Boon stood up , quick . " God damn it ? " he said . " Are you even jealous of a telephone ? " Miss Reba said . " What the hell can he do to her through that damn gutta-percha earpiece ? " But we could hear Minnie : a quick sharp flat sound , then her feet . She came in . She was breathing a little quick , but not much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ai nt nothing wrong , " Minnie said . " He like most of them . He got plenty of appetite but he cant seem to locate where it is . " " Give him a bottle of beer . Unless you 're afraid to go back out there . " " I ai nt afraid , " Minnie said . " He just nature-minded . Maybe a little extra . I 'm used to it . A heap of them are that way : so nature-minded do nt nobody get no rest until they goes to sleep . " " I bet you are , " Boon said . " It 's that tooth . That 's the hell of women : you wont let well enough alone . " " What do you mean ? " Miss Reba said . " You know damn well what I mean , " Boon said . " You do nt never quit . You ai nt never satisfied . You do nt never have no mercy on a damn man . Look at her : ai nt satisfied until she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | gold tooth in the middle of her face just to drive crazy a poor ignorant country nigger ? " " ? or spending five minutes talking into a wooden box just to drive crazy another poor ignorant country bastard that ai nt done nothing in the world but steal an automobile and now a horse . I never knew anybody that needed to get married as bad as you do . " " He sure do , " Minnie said from the door . " That would cure him . I tried it twice and I sho learned my lesson ? " Miss Corrie came in . " All right , " she said : serene , no more plain than a big porcelain lamp with the wick burning inside is plain . " He 's coming too . He 's going to help us . He- " " Not me , " Boon said . " The son of a bitch ai nt going to help me . " " Then beat it , " Miss Reba said . " Get out of here . How you going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse ? Go on . Sit down . You might as for him . Tell us , " she said to Miss Corrie . man ! He You see ? " He 's not a brakeman ! He 's a flag wears a uniform just the same as the conductor 's . He 's going to help us . " All the world loves a lover , quoth think ) the Swan : who saw deeper than any into the human heart . What pity he had no acquaintance with horses , to have added , All the world apparently loves a stolen race horse also . Miss Corrie told us ; and Otis was in the room now though I had n't seen him come in , with something still wrong about him though not noticing him until it was almost too late still was n't it : " We 'll have to buy at least one ticket to Possum to have ? " " It 's Parsham , " Miss Reba said . " All right , " Miss Corrie said . " ? something to check him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will bring the ticket and the baggage check with him . But it will be  | all right ; an empty boxcar will be on a side track  --  Sam will know where  --  and all we have to do is get the horse in it and Sam said wall him up in one corner with planks so he cant slip down ; Sam will have some planks and nails ready too ; he said this was the best he could do at short notice because he did n't dare tell his uncle any more than he had to or his uncle would want to come too . So Sam says the only risk will be getting the horse from here to where the boxcar is waiting . He says it wont do for . . . " She stopped , looking at Ned . " Ned William McCaslin Jefferson Missippi , " Ned said . . . Ned to be walking along even a back street this late at night leading a horse ; the first policeman they pass will stop him . So he  --  Sam  --  is bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and him and Boon and me will lead the horse to the depot and nobody will notice anything . Oh yes ; and the passenger train will ? " " Jesus , " Miss Reba said . " A whore , a pullman conductor and a Missippi swamp rat the size of a water tank leading a race horse through Memphis at midnight Sunday night , and nobody will notice it ? " You stop ! " Miss Corrie said . " Stop what ? " Miss Reba said . " You know . Talking like that in front of ? " " Oh , " Miss Reba said . " If he just dropped up here from Missippi with Boon on a friendly visit you might say , we might of could protected his ears . But using this place as headquarters while they steal automobiles and horses , he 's got to take his chances like anybody else . What were you saying about the train ? " " Yes . The passenger train that leaves for Washington at four A.M. will pick the boxcar up and we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , God damn it , " Miss Reba said . " We ? " " Ai nt you coming too ? " Miss Corrie said .  | That 's what we did . Though first Sam had to see the horse . He came in the back way , through the kitchen , carrying the horse blanket . He was in his uniform . He was almost as big as Boon . So we  --  all of us again  --  stood once more in the back yard , Ned holding the lamp this time , to shine its light not on the horse but on Sam 's brass-buttoned coat and vest and the flat cap with the gold lettering across the front . In fact , I had expected trouble with Ned over Sam and the horse , but I was wrong . " Who , me ? " Ned said . " What for ? We could n't be no better off with a policeman himself leading that horse to Possum . " On the contrary , the trouble we were going to have about Sam would be with Boon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a good horse , " Sam said . " He looks like a damn good horse to me . " " Sure , " Boon said . " He ai nt got no whistle nor bell neither on him . He ai nt even got a headlight . I 'm surprised you can see him a-tall . " " What do you mean by that ? " Sam said . " I do nt mean nothing , " Boon said . " Just what I said . You 're an iron-horse man . Maybe you better go on to the depot without waiting for us . " " You bas ? " Miss Reba said . Then she started over : " Cant you see , the man 's just trying to help you ? going out of his way so that the minute you get back home , the first live animal you 'll see wont be the sheriff ? He 's the one to be inviting you to get to hell back where you came from and take your goddamn horse along with you . Apologise . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " You call that an apology ? " Miss Reba said . " What do you want ? " Boon said . " Me to bend over and invite him to ? " " You hush ! Right this minute ! " Miss Corrie said . " And you do nt help none neither , " Boon said . " You already got me and Miss Reba both to where we 'll have to try to forget the whole English language before we can even pass the time of day . " " That 's no lie , " Miss Reba said . " That one you brought here from Arkansas was bad enough , with one hand in the icebox after beer and the other one reaching for whatever was little and not nailed down whenever anybody was n't looking . And now Boon Hogganbeck 's got to bring another one that 's got me scared to even open my mouth . " " He did n't ! " Miss Corrie said . " Otis do nt take anything without asking first ! Do you , Otis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Ask him . He certainly ought to know . "  | " Ladies , ladies , ladies , " Sam said . " Does this horse want to go to Parsham tonight , or do nt he ? " So we started . But at first Miss Corrie was still looking at Otis and me . " They ought to be in bed , " she said . " Sure , " Miss Reba said . " Over in Arkansas or back down there in Missippi or even further than that , if I had my way . But it 's too late now . You cant send one to bed without the other , and that one of Boon 's owns part of the horse . " Only at the last , Miss Reba could n't go either . She and Minnie could n't be spared . The place was jumping indeed now , but still discreetly , with Sabbath decorum : Saturday night 's fading tide rip in one last spumy upfling against the arduous humdrum of day-by-day for mere bread and shelter . So Ned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the sidewalk we  --  Ned and Otis and me  --  watched Boon and Sam in polyandrous . . . maybe not amity but at least armistice , Miss Corrie between them , leading the horse down the middle of the street from arc light to arc light through the Sunday evening quiet of Second and Third streets , toward the Union depot . It was after ten now ; there were few lights , these only in the other boarding houses ( I was experienced now ; I was a sophisticate ? not a connoisseur of course but at least cognizant ; I recognised a place similar to Miss Reba 's when I saw one ) . The saloons though were all dark . That is , I did n't know a saloon just by passing it ; there were still a few degrees yet veiled to me ; it was Ned who told us  --  Otis and me  --  they were saloons , and that they were closed . I had expected them to be neither one : neither closed nor open ; remember , I had been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , without my mother or father either to instruct me ; I was doing pretty well . " They calls it the blue law , " Ned said . " What 's a blue law ? " I said .  | " I do nt know neither , " Ned said . " Lessen it means they Mewed in all the money Saturday night and ai nt none of them got enough left now to make it worth burning the coal oil . " " That 's just the saloons , " Otis said . " It do nt hurt nobody that way . What they do nt sell Sunday night they can just save it and sell it to somebody , maybe the same folks , Monday . But pugnuckling 's different . You can sell it tonight and turn right around again and sell the same pugnuckling again tomorrow . You ai nt lost nothing . Likely if they tried to put that blue law onto pugnuckling , the police would come in and stop them . " " What 's pugnucking ? " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ned said to Otis . " No wonder Arkansaw cant hold you . If the rest of the folks there knows as much as you do at your age , time they 's twenty-one even Texas wont be big enough . " " t , " Otis said . " What 's pugnuckling ? " I said . " Try can you put your mind on knuckling up some feed for that horse , " Ned said to me , still louder . " To try to keep him quiet long enough to get him to Possum , let alone into that train in the first place . That there railroadowning conductor , flinging boxcars around without even taking his hand out of his pocket , is somebody reminded him of that ? Maybe even a bucket of soap and water too , so your aunt " ? he was talking to Otis now ? " can take you around behind something and wash your mouth out . " " ? t , " Otis said . " Or maybe even the nearest handy stick , " Ned said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we met a policeman . I mean , Otis saw the policeman even before the policeman saw the horse . " Twenty-three skiddoo , " Otis said . The policeman knew Miss Corrie . Then apparently he knew Sam too .  | " Where you taking him ? " he said . " Did you steal him ? " " Borrowed him , " Sam said . They did n't stop . " We rode him to prayer meeting tonight and now we 're taking him back home . " We went on . Otis said Twenty-three skiddoo again . " I never seen that before , " he said . " Every policeman I ever seen before speaking to anybody , they give him something . Like Minnie and Miss Reba already having a bottle of beer waiting for him before he could even get his foot inside , even if Miss Reba cussed him before he come and cussed him again after he left . And ever since I got here last summer and found out about it , every day I go up to Court Square where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , sho enough , here the policeman comes and without even noticing it , takes a apple or a handful of peanuts . " He was almost trotting to keep up with us ; he was that much smaller than me . I mean , he did n't seem so much smaller until you saw him trotting to keep up . There was something wrong about him . When it 's you , you say to yourself Next year I 'm going to be bigger than I am now simply because being bigger is not only natural , it 's inevitable ; it does n't even matter that you cant imagine to yourself how or what you will look like then . And the same with other children ; they cant help it either . But Otis looked like two or three years ago he had already reached where you wont be until next year , and since then he had been going backward . He was still talking . " So what I thought back then was that the only thing to be was a policeman . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too limited . " " Limited to what ? " Ned said . " To beer and apples and peanuts , " Otis said . " Who 's going to waste his time on beer and apples and peanuts ? " He said Twenty-three skiddoo three times now . " This town is where the jack 's at . "  | " Jacks ? " Ned said . " In course they has jacks here . Do nt Memphis need mules the same as anybody else ? " " Jack , " Otis said . " Spondulicks . Cash . When I think about all that time I wasted in Arkansas before anybody ever told me about Memphis . That tooth . How much do you reckon that tooth by itself is worth ? if she just walked into the bank and taken it out and laid it on the counter and said , Gim me change for it ? " " Yes , " Ned said . " I mind a boy like you back there in Jefferson used to keep his mind on money all the time too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here in Memphis , if he 's got any sense , " Otis said . " He never got that far , " Ned said . " The most he could get was into the state penitentiary at Parchman . And at the rate you sounds like going , that 's where you 'll wind up too . " " But not tomorrow , " Otis said . " Maybe not the next day neither . Twenty-three skiddoo , where even a durn policeman cant even pass by without a bottle of beer or a apple or a handful of peanuts put right in his hand before he can even ask for it . Them eighty-five cents them folks give me last night for pumping the pee a noler that that son of a bitch taken away from me this evening . That I might a even pumped that pee a noler free for nothing if I had n't found out by pure accident that they was aiming to pay me for it ; if I had just happened to step out the door a minute , I might a missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they would still a give it to somebody , anybody that just happened to pass by . See what I mean ? Sometime just thinking about it , I feel like just giving up , just quitting . " " Quitting what ? " Ned said . " Quitting for what ? " " Just quitting , " Otis said . " When I think of all them years I spent over there on a durn farm in Arkansas with Memphis right here across the river and I never even  | knowed it . How if I had just knowed when I was four or five years old , what I had to wait until just last year to find out about , sometimes I just want to give up and quit . But I reckon I wont . I reckon maybe I can make it up . How much you folks figger on making out of that horse ? " " Never you mind about that horse , " Ned said . " And the making up you needs to do is to make back up that street to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed . " He even paused , half turning . " Do you know the way back ? " " There ai nt nothing there , " Otis said . " I already tried it . They watch too close . It ai nt like over in Arkansas , when Aunt Corrie was still at Aunt Fittie 's and I had that peephole . If you swapped that automobile for him , you must be figgering on at least two hundred ? " This time Ned turned completely around . Otis sprang , leaped away , cursing Ned , calling him nigger  --  something Father and Grandfather must have been teaching me before I could remember because I do nt know when it began , I just knew it was so : that no gentleman ever referred to anyone by his race or religion . " Go on , " I said . " They 're leaving us . " They were : almost two blocks ahead now and already turning a corner ; we ran , trotted , Ned too , to catch up and barely did so : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to another man , in greasy overalls , with a lantern  --  a switchman , a railroad man anyway . " See what I mean ? " Ned said . " Can you imagine police sending out a man with a lantern to show us the way ? " And you see what I mean too : all the world ( I mean about a stolen race horse ) ; who serves Virtue works alone , unaided , in a chilly vacuum of reserved judgment ; where , pledge yourself to Non-virtue and the whole countryside boils with volunteers to help you . It seems that Sam was trying to persuade Miss Corrie to wait in  | the depot with Otis and me while they located the boxcar and loaded the horse into it , even voluntarily suggesting that Boon attend us with the protection of his size and age and sex : proving that Sam 's half anyway of the polyandrous stalemate was amicable and trusting . But Miss Corrie would have no part of it , speaking for all of us . So we turned aside , following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loading platforms and tracks ; now Ned himself had to come forward and take the halter and quiet the horse to where we could move again in the aura now of the horse 's hot ammoniac reek ( you never smelled a frightened horse , did you ? ) and the steady murmur of Ned 's voice talking to it , both of them  --  murmur and smell  --  thickened , dense , concentrated now between the loom of lightless baggage cars and passenger coaches among the green-and-ruby gleams of switch points ; on until we were clear of the passenger yard and were now following a cinder path beside a spur track leading to a big dark warehouse with a loading platform in front of it . And there was the boxcar too , with a good twenty-five feet of moonlit ( that 's right . We were in moonlight now . Free of the street- and depot-lights , we  --  I ? could see it now ) vacancy between it and the nearest point of the platform  --  a good big jump for even a jumping horse , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) had a little trouble running anyway . Sam cursed quietly the entire depot establishment : switchmen , yard crews , ticket sellers and all . " I 'll go get the goat , " the man with the lantern said . " We do nt need no goat , " Ned said . " No matter how far he can jump . What we needs is to either move that flatform or that boxcar . " " " He means the switch engine , " Sam told Ned . " No , " he told the man with the lantern . " I expected this . For a switching crew to miss just twenty-five feet is practically  | zero . That 's why I told you to bring the key to the section house . Get the crowbars . Maybe Mr Boon wont mind helping you . " " Why do nt you go yourself ? " Boon said . " It 's your railroad . I 'm a stranger here . " " Why do nt you take these boys on back home to bed , if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why do nt you take them back home yourself ? " Boon said . " Your old buddy-boy there has already told you once you ai nt got no business here . " " I 'll go with him to get the crowbars , " Miss Corrie told Sam . " Will you keep your eye on the boys ? " " All right , all right , " Boon said . " Let 's do something , for Christ 's sake . That train will be along in four or five hours while we 're still debating who 's first at the lick dog . Where 's that tool shed , Jack ? " So he and the man with the lantern went on ; we had only moonlight now . The horse hardly smelled at all now and I could see it nuzzling at Ned 's coat like a pet . And Sam was thinking what I had been thinking ever since I saw the platform . " There 's a ramp around at the back , " he said . " Did he ever walk a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and let him look at it . When we get the car placed , we can all help you carry him up if we have to ? " " Do nt you waste your time worrying about us , " Ned said . " You just get that boxcar to where we wont have to jump no ten-foot gash into it . This horse wants to get out of Memphis as bad as you does . " Only I was afraid Sam would say , Do nt you want this boy to go with you ? Because I wanted to see that boxcar moved . I did n't believe it . So we waited . It was n't long ; Boon and the man with the lantern came back with two crowbars that looked at least eight feet long and I watched ( Miss Corrie and Otis too ) while they did it . The man set his lantern  | down and climbed the ladder onto the roof and released the brake wheel and Sam and Boon jammed the ends of the bars between the back wheels and the rails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I still did n't believe it : the car looming black and square and high in the moon , solid and rectangular as a black wall inside the narrow silver frame of the moonlight , one high puny figure wrenching at the brake wheel on top and two more puny figures crouching , creeping , nudging the silver-lanced iron bars behind the back wheels ; so huge and so immobile that at first it looked , not like the car was moving forward , but rather Boon and Sam in terrific pantomimic obeisance were pinching infinitesimally rearward past the car 's fixed and foundationed mass , the moon-mazed panoramic earth : so delicately balanced now in the massive midst of Motion that Sam and Boon dropped the bars and Boon alone pressed the car gently on with his hands as though it were a child 's perambulator , up alongside the platform and into position and Sam said , " All right , " and the man on top set the brake wheel again . So all we had to do now was get the horse into it . Which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have to do now is find the gold mine . We went around to the back of the warehouse . There was a cleated ramp . But the platform had been built at the right height for the drays to load and unload from it , and the ramp was little more than a track for hand trucks and wheelbarrows , stout enough but only about five feet wide , rail-less . Ned was standing there talking to the horse . " He done seen it , " he said . " He know we want him to walk up it but he ai nt decided yet do he want to . I wish now Mr Boxcar Man had went a little further and borried a whup too . " " You got one , " Boon said . He meant me  --  one of my tricks , graces . I made it with my tongue , against the  | sounding board of my mouth , throat , gorge  --  a sound quite sharp and loud , as sharp and loud when done right as the crack of a whip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our yard , let alone in the house . Then it made Grandmother jump once and use a swear word . But just once . That was almost a year ago so I might have forgotten how by this time . " That 's right , " Ned said . " So we has . " He said to me : " Get you a long switch . They ought to be one in that hedge bush yonder . " There was : a privet bush ; all this was probably somebody 's lawn or garden before progress , industry , commerce , railroads came . I cut the switch and came back . Ned led the horse up , facing the ramp . " Now you big folks , Mr Boon and Mr Boxcar , come up one on either side like you was the gateposts . " They did so , Ned halfway up the ramp now , with the lead rope , facing the horse and talking to it . " There you is , " he said . " Right straight up this here chicken walk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He came back down , already turning the horse , moving fairly rapidly , speaking to me now : " He done seen the switch . Fall right in behind him . Do nt touch him nor pop till I tell you to . " I did that , the three of us  --  Ned , the horse , then me  --  moving directly away from the ramp for perhaps twenty yards , when without stopping Ned turned and wheeled the horse , I still following , until it faced the rise of the ramp between Boon and Sam twenty yards away . When it saw the ramp , it checked . " Pop , " Ned said . I made the sound , a good one ; the horse sprang a little , Ned already moving on , a little faster now , back toward the ramp . " When I tells you to pop this time , touch him with the switch . Do nt hit : just tap him at the root of his tail a second after you pops . " He had already passed between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse was now trying to decide which to do : refuse , or run out ( with the addi-  | tional confusion of having to decide which of Boon and Sam would run over the easiest ) or simply bolt over and through us all . You could almost see it happening : which was maybe what Ned was counting on : an intelligence panicky and timorous and capable of only one idea at a time , in which the intrusion of a second one reduces all to chaos . " Pop , " Ned said . This time I tapped the horse too , as Ned had told me . It surged , leaped , its forefeet halfway up the ramp , the near hind foot ( Boon 's side ) striking the edge of the ramp and sliding off until Boon , before Ned could speak , grasped the leg in both hands and set it back on the ramp , leaning his weight against the flank , the horse motionless now , trembling , all four feet on the ramp now . " Now , " Ned said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'll know he got something behind him to not let him fall . " " To not let him back off the ramp , you mean , " Sam said . " We need one of the crowbars . Go get it , Charley . " " That 's right , " Ned said . " We gonter need that crowbar in a minute . But all we needs right now is that switch . You 's too little , " he told me . " Let Mr Boon and Mr Boxcar have it . Loop it behind his hocks like britching . " They did so , one at each end of the limber switch . " Now , walk him right on up . When I say pop this time , pop loud , so he will think the lick gonter be loud too . " But I did n't need to pop at all again . Ned said to the horse : " Come on , son . Let 's go to Possum , " and the horse moved , Boon and Sam moving with it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its forefeet on the solid platform now , then one final scuffling scrabbling surge , the platform resounding once as if it had leaped onto a wooden bridge . " It 's going to take more than this switch or that boy popping his tongue either , to get him into that car , " Sam said . " What gonter get him into that boxcar is that crowbar , "  | Ned said . " Ai nt it come yet ? " It was here now . " Prize that-ere chicken walk loose , " Ned said . " Wait , " Sam said . " What for ? " " So he can walk on it into that boxcar , " Ned said . " He 's used to it now . He 's done already found out ai nt nothing at the other end gonter hurt or skeer him . " " He ai nt smelled the inside of an empty boxcar yet though , " Sam said . " That 's what I 'm thinking about . " But Ned 's idea did make sense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boggle even if Ned had commanded us to throw down both walls of the warehouse so the horse would n't have to turn corners . So Boon and the railroad man prized the ramp away from the platform . " God damn it , " Sam said . " Do it quiet , cant you ? " " Ai nt you right here with us ? " Ned said . " Sholy you can get a little more benefit outen them brass buttons than just walking around in them . " Though it took all of us , including Miss Corrie , to lift the ramp onto the platform and carry it across and lay it like a bridge from the platform into the black yawn of the open car door . Then Ned led the horse up and at once I understood what Sam had meant . The horse had not only never smelled an empty boxcar before , but unlike mere humans it could see inside too ; I remember thinking Now that we 've torn up the ramp , we cant even get it down off the platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened . I mean , nothing happened . I mean , I do nt know what happened ; none of us did . Ned led the horse , its hooves ringing loud and hollow on the planks , up to the end of the ramp which was now a bridge , Ned standing on the bridge just inside the door , talking to the horse , pulling lightly on the halter until the horse put one foot forward onto the bridge and I do nt know what I was thinking ; a moment ago I had believed that not in all Memphis were there enough people to get that horse into  | that black orifice , then the next instant I was expecting that same surge and leap which would have taken the horse inside the boxcar as it had up the ramp ; when the horse lifted the foot and drew it back to the platform , it and Ned facing each other like a tableau . I heard Ned breathe once . " You folks just step back to the wall , " he said . We did so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just saw him , one hand holding the lead rope , the other stroking , touching the horse 's muzzle . Then he stepped back into the car and vanished ; the lead rope tightened but only his voice came out : " Come on , son . I got it . " " I 'll be God damned , " Sam said . Because that was all . The loose bridge clattered a little , the cavernous blackness inside the car boomed to the hooves , but no more . We carried the lantern in ; the horse 's eyes glowed coldly and vanished where Ned stood with it in the corner . " Where 's them planks and nails you talked about ? " he asked Sam . " Bring that chicken walk on in ; that 's already one whole wall . " " Hell , " Sam said . " Hold on now . " " Folks coming in here tomorrow morning already missing a whole boxcar , " Ned said , " ai nt gonter have time to be little-minded over a homemade ladder outen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except Ned  --  including Miss Corrie carried the ravished ramp into the car and set it up and held it in place while Boon and Sam and the railroad man ( Sam had the planks and nails ready too ) built a stall around the horse in the corner of the car ; before Ned could even complain , Sam had a bucket for water and a box for grain and even a bundle of hay too ; we all stood back now in the aura of the horse 's contented munching . " He just the same as in Possum right this minute , " Ned said . " What you folks better wish is that he has already crossed that finish line first day after tomorrow , " Sam said . " What time is it ? " Then he told us himself : " Just  | past midnight . Time for a little sleep before the train leaves at four . " He was talking to Boon now . " You and Ned will want to stay here with your horse of course ; that 's why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and I 'll take Corrie and the boys on back home and we 'll all meet here at ? " " You says , " Boon said , not harshly so much as with a kind of cold grimness . " You do the meeting here at four oclock . If you do nt oversleep , maybe we 'll see you . " He was already turning . " Come on , Corrie . " " You 're going to leave your boss 's automobile  --  I mean your boss 's horse  --  I mean this horse , whoever it really belongs to  --  here with nobody to watch it but this colored boy ? " Sam said . " Naw , " Boon said . " That horse belongs to the railroad now . I got a baggage check to prove it . Maybe you just borrowed that railroad suit to impress women and little boys in but as long as you 're in it you better use it to impress that baggage check or the railroad might not like it . " " Boon ! " Miss Corrie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Come on , Lucius , you and Otis . " " It 's all right , " Sam said . " We keep on forgetting how Boon has to slave for five or six months in that cotton patch or whatever it is , to make one night on Catalpa Street . You all go on . I 'll see you at the train . " " Cant you even say much obliged ? " Miss Corrie said to Boon . " Sure , " Boon said . " Who do I owe one to ? the horse ? " " Try one on Ned , " Sam said . He said to Ned : " You want me to stay here with you ? " " We 'll be all right , " Ned said . " Maybe if you go too it might get quiet enough around here to where somebody can get some sleep . I just wish now I had thought in time to " I did , " Sam said . " Where 's that other bucket , Charley ? "  | The railroad man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it was in the same corner of the car with the planks and nails and tools and the feed ; it contained a thick crude ham sandwich and a quart bottle of water and a pint bottle of whiskey . " There you are , " Sam said . " Breakfast too . " " I see it , " Ned said . " What 's your name , Whitefolks ? " " Sam Caldwell , " Sam said . " Sam Caldwell , " Ned said . " It strikes me that Sam Caldwell is a better name for this kind of horse business than twice some others a man could mention around here . A little more , and I could be wishing me and you was frequent enough to be permanent . Kindly much obliged . " " You 're kindly welcome , " Sam said . So we said good night to Sam and Ned and Charley ( all of us except Boon and Otis , that is ) and went back to Miss Reba 's . The streets were empty and quiet now ; Memphis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get at least a little sleep and rest to face Monday morning with ; we walked quietly too from vacant light to light between the dark windows and the walls : but one faint single light dimly visible in what my new infallible roue 's instinct recognised immediately as a competitor of Miss Reba ; a single light similar in wanness behind Miss Reba 's curtains because even here throe must by this time have spent itself ; even Minnie herself gone to bed or home or wherever she retired to at her and Miss Reba 's trade 's evensong . Because Miss Reba herself unlocked the front door to us , smelling strongly of gin and , in her hard handsome competent way , even beginning to look like it . She had changed her dress too . This one did n't have hardly any top to it at all , and in those days ladieswomen  --  did n't really paint their faces , so that was the first time I ever saw that too . And she had on still more diamonds , as big and yellowish as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't gone to bed either . She was standing in the door to Miss Reba 's room , looking just about worn out . " All fixed ? " Miss Reba said , locking the door behind us . " Yes , " Miss Corrie said . " Why do nt you go to bed ? Minnie , make her go to bed . " " You could a asked me that a hour back from now , " Minnie said . " I just wish would n't nobody still be asking it two hours ahead from now . But you was n't here that other time two years ago . " " Come on to bed , " Miss Corrie said . " When we get back from Possum Wednesday ? " " God damn it , Parsham , " Miss Reba said . " All right , " Miss Corrie said . " ? Wednesday , Minnie will have found out where he is and we can go and get him . " " Sure , " Miss Reba said . " And bury him right there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , if I had any sense . You want a drink ? " she said to Boon . " Minnie 's a damn christian scientist or republican or something and wont take one . " " Somebody around here has got to not take one , " Minnie said . " It do nt need no republican for that . All it needs is just to be wore out and want to go to bed . " " That 's what we all need , " Miss Corrie said . " That train leaves at four , and it 's already after one . Come on , now . " " Go to bed then , " Miss Reba said . " Who the hell 's stopping you ? " So we went upstairs . Then Otis and I went upstairs again ; he knew the way : an attic , with nothing in it but some trunks and boxes and a mattress made up into a bed on the floor . Otis had a nightshirt but ( the nightshirt still had the creases in it where Miss Corrie I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) he went to bed just like I had to : took off his pants and
