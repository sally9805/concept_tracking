Travelers at New York 's Kennedy International Airport were hopping mad last week - hopping out of cars , hopping over fences , even taking gates off hinges in their frenzy to escape the colossal traffic jams . One motorist needed 45 minutes to drive the two miles from the airport 's entrance to the Eastern Air Lines terminal . Another left Greenwich , Conn. , early enough to reach Kennedy a full hour before his scheduled 8:30 p.m . Swissair departure , only to find himself at the end of an endless , motionless line of autos when he got to the field . Both missed their flights . <P> For the airlines , it was the busiest week of the year . By the tens of thousands , Americans were flying in from summer vacations , and foreign tourists were flying away after visits to the U.S. The resulting chaos at Kennedy gave ample warning of what lies ahead as the nation 's airports approach what authorities call " complete saturation " in the surge of travelers to take their trips by air . Statistics suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,100 U.S. airliners that plied American skies in 1966 . By 1977 , when the 490-seat jumbo jets will be in full service , the number of passengers is expected to rise to 350 million . <P> The Dead End . The problem of moving this vast torrent of people between cities is difficult enough . But the real headache is handling the flow from city to airport and in the airports themselves . As William Pereira , master planner for the Los Angeles Airport Commission , puts it : " The real bottleneck in the jet age is not in the air but on the ground . We must break the ground barrier . " <P> Every airport manager in the nation is aware of the looming crisis , and many have already begun to grope for solutions . Cleveland recently decided to extend its rapid transportation lines four miles to reach its Hopkins airport . Chicago has mulled over the possibility of damming Lake Michigan near the Loop for additional airfield space . And New York is debating a fourth airport , which may be 50 miles or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are those in progress at Los Angeles . <P> Its airport was brand-new six years ago - and outmoded before the cement on its new runways was dry . Its single-entrance internal road system has been dubbed the " world 's largest cul-de-sac , " and last fall it suffered a monumental traffic tie-up similar to Kennedy 's disaster last week . But things are about to change . The city has approved a $500 million program to expand the airport by 1971 . <P> The Los Angeles Airport commissioners and their consultants , one of whom was Architect Pereira , were not really caught napping . Volume at the city 's old terminal in 1956 was about 3,000,000 passengers a year . Though the forecast for 1965 was 7,000,000 , the Los Angeles planners decided to bet on eleven million . Even then , they were short of the mark , and the estimates for this year are close to 20 million , and for 1975 a whopping 55 million . <P> Up by Snorkel . Pereira 's plan looks toward the construction of five new airline terminals-all underground and equipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airport . Their probable occupants will be Pan American , TWA , United , American and Continental .
