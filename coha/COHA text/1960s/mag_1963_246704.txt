Under Brazil 's constitution , the President can petition Congress to declare a state of siege in the event of " grave internal disturbances or when there is evidence that disturbances are about to erupt . " The words precisely described the chaotic state of affairs in Latin America 's biggest nation last week , and President Joao Goulart made it official . Unable to cope with any of the major crises - and few of the small ones-he asked the Brazilian Congress to proclaim a 30-day state of siege . <P> The problems were not new . They were just getting worse . Sucked up by a fierce inflationary spiral , the country 's cost of living soared 45% between January and August , while the value of the cruzeiro tumbled 14% . At one point last week , 30 major walkouts were under way or immediately threatened-a streetcar strike in Rio , a railroad strike in Sao Paulo , a bank strike throughout the country . <P> Goulart is under attack from every side . The labor unions , which brought him to political power , denounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army troops put down a flash rebellion of air force and navy noncoms . On the right , the two most powerful state governors , Guanabara 's Carlos Lacerda and Sao Paulo 's Adhemar de Barros , talk about taking matters in their own hands-and point ominously to some 70,000 state troops at their command . Last week Lacerda told a reporter for the Los Angeles Times that he expected total collapse before long . " I do n't think this thing will go to the end of the year , " he said , and warned that further U.S. aid " would be like trying to sell roses in an opium den . " <P> Coming at a time when a Brazilian mission was in Washington seeking a crucial credit extension , Lacerda 's statement was the final straw so far as Goulart was concerned . His Justice Minister declared the two state governors " in a true state of belligerence with the federal government , " and the President went to Congress . If the Congressmen declare a state of siege , Goulart will assume power to censor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrests without warrants , restrict travel , banish anyone to " any healthful populated area " in Brazil , and seize all state militias . <P> To many Brazilians that spells dictatorship . Almost everyone seemed against Goulart 's demand for extraordinary powers-the right , the left , the press , state governors and a large section of Congress . Only Goulart and some powerful members of the military were emphatically for it . Said Air Minister Anisio Botelho cryptically : " Either we fall or we stand . "
