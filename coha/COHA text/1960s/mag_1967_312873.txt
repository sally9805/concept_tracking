MICHEL , MICHEL by Robert Lewis . 735 pages . Simon &; Schuster. $7.50 . <P> <P> After a publisher produces two hits , a good move is to find a third book that mates them . Simon &; Schuster boasts one of the year 's biggest Jewish novels , The Chosen , as well as a more lighthearted Catholic bestseller , The Secret of Santa Vittoria .

During the war , a daring band of nuns spirits him to safety in a nursery run by Mile . Odette Rose , who has Michel baptized , and after the war refuses to give him up to his aunt and uncle in Palestine . Her battle is joined by the French Catholic Church up to the level of cardinal .

Though modeled on St. Peter , he proves to be papier-mache instead of rock .
