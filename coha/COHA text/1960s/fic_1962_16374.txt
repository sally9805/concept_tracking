FADE IN : 1 . INT . MAIDEN LANE BAR SAN FRANCISCO DAY View page imageThis is a typical watering place of the post-work American male . It is about six o'clock in the evening on an early fall weekday and the bar is lined two deep with flannel-suited knitted-tied men , each with a drink in his hand . As we PAN SLOWLY along the bar we half-hear bits and pieces of disjointed conversation : " Ah , take the six twenty-four . Let ' er wait , " " Have another one , and let me get it , " " Louie , this is not dry enough , " " But here you 've got a situation where Trendex has it in the lead and Neilsen 's got it way down the list , " " I tried to watch it but I hated it and I turned it off , " etc .

He takes the little black book from Abe , crosses to the phone booth , goes in and shuts the door . We see him in there , checking the number in the black book , dropping coins , dialing , waiting . Louie , the bartender , brings him a fresh drink , puts it down at Joe 's place , sees he is n't there , looks at the phone booth , sees Joe there , motions " Want it over there ?

FRANCIS YACHT CLUB NIGHT At a berth in the b.g. we see a partially-covered motor launch , the " Ship 's Boat " of Aben el Sud 's yacht . A cab comes into the SHOT and stops . KIRSTEN ARNESEN gets out of the cab . She is about twenty , dressed modestly in a skirt and jacket , a vision of simple soft radiant blondness .

The boat pulls away from the dock , sets a course for a luxurious yacht in mid-harbor. 4 . JOE AND GIRLS IN LAUNCH &nbsp; JOE ( to girls , businesslike ) Now , let 's go over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need : Prince Aben el Sud comes from a country which is practically floating on a pool of oil . Mr. Trayner , of Trayner Drilling Corporation drills oil wells . Therefore Mr. Trayner wants to be certain his Oil-Rich Highness has a good time while he 's here . So when his Oil-Rich Highness expressed a boyish wish to meet some " American actresses " because of his interest in the arts of all countries , Mr. Trayner was only too eager to oblige , or rather , to have his ad agency have a public relations man  --  that 's me  --  oblige . This may come as a shock , but you , ladies , are those " American actresses . " You 're from MGM , just got your first big break ; you 've just signed with Warners ; you 're making a picture with Paramount . You think orientals are absolutely fascinating . You 've always thought so . But do n't push it . Let it happen . And do n't forget  --  please  --  you 've got class .

All right , girls . He motions the girls to follow him , jumps onto the platform and runs up the steps after Kirsten .

Through this short exchange we have been FEATURING KIRSTEN .

QUARTER-DECK AREA NIGHT The party is over , the last guests are piling unsteadily into the motor launch for the trip to shore . Featured on the steps of the gangway are Trayner , laughing and descending with precarious unbalance , and Kirsten , dutifully helping her boss and lending her sober young frame to lean on . In the launch the guests are sprawled about in varying stages of drunkenness and exhaustion . Joe , much the worse for the evening 's wear , is painfully counting the " starlets.

He walks quickly to a door marked " Trayner Drilling Corporation " and enters . 14 . INT . TRAYNER DRILLING CORP . OFFICES DAY Expensively decorated . Kirsten 's desk is just outside Trayner 's private office , the door to which is open . Kirsten is seated at her desk reading a book . As she reads she breaks off pieces from a large chocolate bar on her desk and pops them into her mouth . Through the open door to Trayner 's office we may see a cleaning woman working . Joe breezes in with a big smile . &nbsp; JOEHi . Kirsten is n't cordial . She immediately shuts her book and begins to prepare to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of desk , etc . &nbsp; KIRSTENMr .

I have to meet Mr. Trayner at a board meeting . &nbsp; JOELook - we sort of got started on the wrong foot , and it was sort of my fault , so I sort of brought a peace offering .

I hate peanut brittle .  --  13  --  She continues preparing to leave the office . Joe looks at the candy as though it were some kind of abnormal growth . He glances into Trayner 's office and sees the charwoman watching him . She quickly resumes her work . Joe raises the candy above his head and slams it viciously into a waste basket , eliciting only a glance from Kirsten . He walks out . Kirsten crosses to the desk , picks up her purse and gloves , opens the drawer as an afterthought and breaks off another chunk of chocolate , and crosses to the door . &nbsp; KIRSTENGood night , Gladys . &nbsp; GLADYS ( the cleaning woman ) Good night , Miss Arnesen . Kirsten goes out . 15 . EXT . HALL Joe is waiting for the elevator . Kirsten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really steaming .

The ELEVATOR OPERATOR looks at him quizzically . &nbsp; ELEVATOR OPERATORDown ? Joe reluctantly gets into the elevator . 16 . INT . ELEVATOR Three or four other passengers are there . For a few moments Joe ignores Kirsten , but finally he ca n't bear it any longer . &nbsp; JOEAs long as we 're on the subject of what people do for a living , let me ask you a question that might embarrass you a little . The other passengers look at Kirsten . She looks off into space as though she does n't know who he 's talking to .  --  14  --  &nbsp; JOE ( Cont . ) What special qualifications do you think you have for a job that allows you to sit around all day and chat with the boss  --  oh , I 've heard about your job  --  and answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties and spend half your working day reading a book , while two typists who get less money than you do all the work ? The elevator stops , the doors open to the ground floor . The action reminds Joe that people have been listening and that he has let himself get carried away . The people push past him to get out of the elevator . &nbsp; KIRSTEN ( to the elevator operator , airily ) That reminds me , I forgot my book . She remains at the back of the elevator . The elevator operator looks at Joe , waiting for him to get out , finally gives up , shrugs , shuts doors , and starts up . He looks from one to the other of the warring factions , and finally , unable to stand the tension : &nbsp; ELEVATOR OPERATORShe always carries that book . &nbsp; JOE ( bursting out as before ) I 'll tell you what special qualifications you have ! You 're pretty , that 's what special qualifications you have . And that old lech loves to have you around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk like he did last night , and who knows what else , that 's what special qualifications you have ! During his speech the elevator stops , and the doors open . Kirsten slaps him hard and gets off . Joe is stunned for a moment . Again the operator wonders if he 's going to get off or not . He has about decided he is n't when he does , barely beating the doors . 17 . INT . HALL DAY Joe hurries to catch up with Kirsten.  --  15  --  &nbsp; JOEListen , I 'm sorry .

Do n't blame you for a minute , Joe . But I do n't know what we can do about it . Unless we put another man on there . We could do that .

That means four months on the wagon at least , and strictly . So , just projecting ahead , this is going to make him pretty dull company for Ballefoy , so  --  you 're way ahead of me , Rog .

Thus Gordon 's unfortunate handicap renders him virtually useless on the account . You , on the other hand , being the acknowledged champion tosspot of the third floor , should fit into the picture admirably . Want to meet him this afternoon ? &nbsp; JOEWhy not ? &nbsp; LELAND ( picking up phone ) You two will get on famously .

All I have to do to qualify myself is to say that I drank too much too often over too long a period of time . Welcome to the regular weekly meeting of the Mason Street Group of Alcoholics Anonymous . ( reading from back of pamphlet ) " Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of men and women who share their experience , strength and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism . The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking . AA has no dues or fees . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or institution ; does not wish to engage in any controversy ; neither endorses nor opposes any causes .

The idea did n't scare me at first , because I 've always been told I have a great line of bull .

INT . VERY CLOSE SHOT A BOTTLE NIGHT The bottle is lying on its side on the floor . It is empty . A trembling hand reaches into the SHOT and grabs the bottle . PAN the bottle up to Joe 's face . Joe is stupefied , brutalized , functional on only the simplest level . His face , up close , is frightening . He squints at the bottle , then tilts it to his lips , tilts it vertical , sucking at it , getting nothing . His tongue goes into the neck of the bottle like an animal 's tongue hunting a drop of nectar . He pulls the bottle away from his face in pitiful , childish disappointment . He tosses it away  --  not with anger , with disinterest . 171 . WIDER SHOT THE BOTTLE CRASHES ON THE FLOOR Kirsten , face down on the bed , her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the floor like a mop , does n't stir at the sound of the crash . She is out cold . The cabin is a shambles , bottles strewn everywhere . Joe is dressed only in trousers and shoes . The shoes , untied , flop on his feet . Joe picks up two or three more bottles , finds nothing , tosses them away . Standing in the middle of the floor , a swaying tower about to topple , he comes to a decision . He takes his shirt off the back of a chair and begins to struggle into it . DISSOLVE TO : 172 . EXT . TOURIST COURT NIGHT Joe lunges out the door of the cabin .

He bounces off the fence , appraises it a moment , decides he can push down the top wire and step over , and does so , tearing his clothes .

Not as bad as you imagined I would . Thanks for trying . But I know how I look . This is the way I look when I 'm sober . That 's enough to make a person drink , would n't you say ? Suddenly , impulsively , Joe 's arms are around her . They are like positive and negative magnetic fields slamming together . She holds him desperately , a waif clinging to a shelter . There are no words . Joe would like to say " You 're home . Everything is all right . " But he knows it is n't . It is Joe who pushes them apart . He needs the distance to save himself . From now on there is a certain reserve in his manner with her . &nbsp; KIRSTEN ( after a moment , with effort ) Joe  --  I have n't had a drink in two days . &nbsp; JOEWell , that  --  that 's terrific . &nbsp; KIRSTENIt was n't easy .

There 's a little kid in there asleep who sure would like to wake up and find you here , so all you have to do is say the right words . &nbsp; KIRSTENI do n't know if I have the right words .
