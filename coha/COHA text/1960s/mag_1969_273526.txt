When U.S. astronauts finally reach the surface of the moon , they will land in an ungainly-looking little craft that is officially named the Lunar Module ( LM ) but is becoming known as " the Spider . " Scheduled to be tested in manned flight for the first time next week during the flight of Apollo 9 , the Spider is the homely offspring of a concept of Aeronautical Engineer John Houbolt , an unsung hero of the U.S. space program . NASA officials now agree that without Houbolt 's lonely campaign early in the 1960s , the U.S. would have been hard pressed to meet John Kennedy 's goal of landing men on the moon before 1970 . <P> Even before Kennedy set that goal , NASA scientists , aerospace companies and independent research laboratories were locked in an often bitter debate over the most practical method of making a manned lunar landing . Top NASA officials , most of them trained in airplane development , had generally sided with a direct approach . They wanted a craft that could take off from earth , fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Monster Rocket . Wernher von Braun , director of the NASA facilities at Huntsville , Ala. , favored an earth-orbital-rendezvous technique ; two or more rockets would be used separately to launch a spacecraft and fuel-carrying stages into earth orbit , where they would be assembled for a flight to the moon . Pasadena 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , which is most concerned with unmanned space shots , proposed that extra fuel and supplies be rocketed to the surface of the moon and then be brought together into a supply depot by a remotecontrolled tractor . The astronauts would land near by . <P> All of the proposals presented nearly insuperable difficulties . For direct ascent from earth to moon , a giant , 12-million-lb. - thrust rocket would be needed-and there were strong doubts that such a monster could be designed , built and tested before the end of the decade . For Von Braun 's earth-orbital scheme , a minimum of two expensive Saturn 5 launches would be needed . Both plans called for the expenditure of as much as 100,000 lbs . of fuel merely to settle a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lunar surface . The JPL idea , while permitting the design of a smaller landing craft , would have required several separate launches and had the added risk that astronauts might be stranded on the moon if they landed too far from their previously launched supplies . <P> While the various factions wrangled , Engineer Houbolt , whose work at NASA 's Langley Research Center was not directly connected with space flight , was impressed by still another moon-landing technique : the lunar-orbit rendezvous . Houbolt 's plan was to leave the mother craft in orbit around the moon while a light , ferrylike craft descended from it to the lunar surface carrying only one or two of the astronauts . Later , the little craft could blast off , rendezvous and dock with the mother ship , and then be left behind in lunar orbit as the astronauts returned to earth .
