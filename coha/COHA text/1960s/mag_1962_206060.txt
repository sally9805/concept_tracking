Man of the Year Sir : <P> Your selection of John Kennedy as Man of the Year is an insult to both the intelligence and integrity of your readers . Although articulate , he is a man of inaction ; although forceful in appearance , he is inadequate in performance . <P> RALPH R. ANDERSON Secretary Young Americans for Freedom Englewood , N.J. <P> Sir : <P> TIME has indeed amassed an impressive list of failures for Mr. Kennedy . His chief asset seems to be that he is willing to learn from his mistakes . I hope we survive this year 's " learning process . " <P> CLAUDE S. NICHOLS Colorado Springs , Colo . <P> Sir : <P> Pietro Annigoni 's portrait of John F. Kennedy projected a magnificent image of an individual burdened with the world 's most critical responsibilities . But it can hardly be termed a comely honorarium for a personality awarded the title of Man of the Year . <P> OLLIE H. FRAZIER Fort Belvoir , Va . <P> Sir : <P> Artist Annigoni painted Mr. Kennedy with a cauliflower left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyelid , an eversion of the left lower eyelid , a hint of edema in his left cheek . The President displayed none of these findings when I had the honor of meeting him recently . <P> J. B. BOUNDS , M.D. Hospital Director VA Roanoke Hospital Salem , Va . <P> Sir : <P> Your cover would make Charles Addams happy , Dorian Gray jealous , and Herblock anxious . <P> CORNELIA CLAY New Orleans <P> Sir : <P> A jaundiced Dracula in ragpicker 's clothing-in a background of bile ! <P> H. S. DALTON Key West , Fla . <P> Sir : <P> Man of the Year he is ! But Artist Annigoni 's conception of Mr. Kennedy is not in Sine with the image preferred by " the public . " " For shame ! <P> MARGARET E. SMITH Amherst , Mass . <P> Sir : <P> Kudos for TIME ! Kennedy as Man of the Year and TIME as Realist of the Year . <P> I was especially impressed with Annigoni 's masterful portrait . <P> DAVID M. LITTIG Madison , Wis . <P> Sir : <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was some real quality work involved . Maybe that 's the way good paintings are . <P> GENE T. DAVIS Coral Gables , Fla . <P> Sir : <P> Kennedy portrait-a masterpiece . <P> DAVID CHURCHILL Hingham , Mass . <P> Sir : <P> I would say that Maestro Annigoni paints as he lives , chaotically and simply . Certainly , the portrait is not characteristic of our President . And what injustice did he inflict upon the royal family ? <P> FRAMPTON HARPER <P> York , S.C . <P> Annigoni 's portraits of the royal family stirred considerable controversy in England . For a detail of his Prince Philip , see cut. - ED . <P> Sir : <P> It took guts to choose President Kennedy as your Man of the Year . Like several others in the past , the President needs the prayers and best wishes of all of us . <P> B. MATTHEW BLOOMFIELD Houston <P> Great Guy ? <P> Sir : <P> I have just put down your story on Jackie Gleason Dec. 29 with feelings of supreme disgust .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
