Now that traditional infectious diseases of children are so well controlled , one of the commonest causes of death among U.S. children is acute leukemia . It appears most often between the ages of two and five , and it accounts for about a third of all childhood cancers . Though it affects cells of the lymphatic system , it rarely causes solid tumors and is regarded as a " cancer of the blood . " What connection can this possibly have with a hideously deforming and quick-killing cancer of the jaw that afflicts African children ? Researchers now think they know . The African disease offers the best chance to date of proving a relationship between a virus and a form of human cancer , and may help to explain why American leukemia cases sometimes appear in clusters-a phenomenon that has led to suspicions of an infectious element in leukemia . <P> Geographically Interesting . The link between these two seemingly unrelated diseases is suggested in the A.M.A. Journal by Dr. Gilbert Dalldorf of Manhattan 's Sloan-Kettering Institute . In equatorial Africa , he points out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they rarely take the form of leukemia and are almost invariably solid tumors . They are usually seen first in the jawbones ( though they also attack other bones and internal organs ) of children aged three to eight . <P> What makes the African tumors especially interesting to researchers is their geography . They occur clear across the continent , and down the east coast as far as Loureno Marques . Since they are found in children of all races , their cause is not likely to lie in ethnic factors . But there are two cutoffs : the tumors do not occur in children living above about 5,000 ft. , or in areas with less than 20 in. of annual rainfall . The map of African tumor occurrence , with its highland islands of tumor-free children , almost matches the maps for yellow fever and one form of sleeping sickness . <P> Bunyamwera Trial . To Uganda 's Professor Jack N. P. Davies , this suggested that the children 's cancers might be caused , or at least triggered , by a mosquito-borne virus . Now British investigators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a virus from the cancers . But the region is a rich source of competing and often confusing viruses . Ironically , one of these , named Bunyamwera ( after a Uganda district ) , has been tried experimentally as a treatment for cancer . It was a cluster of leukemia cases among children in the Chicago suburb of Niles , Ill . ( TIME , June 2 , 1961 ) , that backed up the suggestion of a viral role in the lymphatic leukemia of American children . <P> For all their superficial differences , Dr. Dalldorf notes , the diseases have two important factors in common . The tumor cells are of the same type , and both diseases can be slowed down , or arrested for a year or two , by the same radiation and drug treatment . ( Sloan-Kettering medical teams have gone to Kenya and treated many patients there . ) So , suggests Dr. Dalldorf , the lymphatic cancers of children , in Africa and elsewhere , may be two sides of the same coin .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
