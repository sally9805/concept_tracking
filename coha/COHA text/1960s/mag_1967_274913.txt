In the shadowless reaches of the Spanish Sahara , some 40 miles from the Atlantic Coast , the dusty oasis of Bu-Craa swelters in the middle of a moonscape of endless dunes and burned-out scrub . It is an ancient cross roads for camel caravans and fierce des ert nomads in their swirling burnooses . For years , Spanish Foreign Legionnaires in their whitewashed forts knew Bu-Craa as a lonely corner of the end of the world . <P> It will be lonely no longer . Last week the Spanish government announced that at Bu-Craa , in partnership with the International Minerals &; Chemical Corp . of Skokie , Ill. , it will soon begin mining the world 's richest phosphate deposits , delivering the raw material of chemical fertilizer to an expanding market all over the world . <P> Secrecy . Disclosure of Spain 's contract with null marked the end of 21 years of secret and almost byzantine negotiations . For as soon as Spanish geologists found the rich phosphate vein back in 1963 , Generalissimo Franco 's ministers forbade publication of any hint of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The political situation in northern Africa has long been touchy : both Morocco and Mauritania claim the Spanish Sahara . Occasionally , they have gone so far as to threaten to back up their claims with force . Moreover , Spain has been under mounting pressure in the U.N . to give up its African possessions . So there was little point in making the Sahara suddenly sound attractive . <P> Quietly and cautiously , the Spanish government set about looking for a partner-preferably a U.S. firm that could bring in both capital and technical know-how . In March 1965 , bids were solicited from some 30 companies , including British , German and Japanese . Each competitor sought out representatives in Madrid with the best contacts and noblest titles that could be found . <P> Early in the game , all the competing U.S. firms got discreet assurances from Washington that there would be no objection to private U.S. capital participation in the project , despite the political risks involved . <P> <P> Fighting the Giants . As weaker operators began to fall out during tortuous negotiations , a consortium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loeb , Rhoades &; Co. , and headed by former Treasury Secretary Robert Anderson , soon emerged as the leading contender . Anderson was a steady visitor to Spain , even won an audience with Franco . Then , last November , Continental Oil pulled out of the Anderson consortium , and all its hopes were wrecked . A new group , including Gulf Oil , W.R. Grace , Texaco , and Standard Oil of Calif. , entered the race with a combined bid . I.M.C. was left to fight it out with the quartet of giants . No one gave I.M.C. a chance . <P> Throughout the negotiations , the venture had been discussed as a joint Spanish-American undertaking , with 45% going to the U.S. partner . But last March , when Madrid decided to strengthen its bid for a link with the Common Market , it seemed a good idea for Spain to show itself as Europe-oriented by offering Common Market companies a piece of the Sahara bonanza . That piece , of course , was to come out of the American share . I.M.C. was first to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its demand for 45% participation to 25% and won .
