For 24 years . Biochemist Choh Hao Li has devoted himself to discovering the functions of a small part of a small , lima-bean-sized gland that is lodged at the base of the human brain . With each experiment the Canton-born professor of biochemistry and endocrinology has come closer than any man before him to explaining how the front half of the human pituitary , the body 's master gland , controls so many functions through the hormones it manufactures . Because his success represents a singular medical triumph , Dr. Li last week was awarded the $10,000 Albert Lasker Basic Research Award. * <P> Duplicating Nature . From the pitui-tary 's front lobe . Biochemist Li has isolated no fewer than five other hormones , including the enormously potent adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) . Three other hormones he discovered are involved in the female reproductive cycle ; finally there is the human growth hormone ( HGH , or somatotropin ) , which may yet prove to be the most important of all . <P> Dr. Li and others ferreted out the detailed structure of ACTH by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to duplicate nature , or even improve on it . by making ACTH in the laboratory . The natural hormone contains 39 amino acids in a chain . Dr. Li made chains of 17 and 19 acids , and in some ways those short chains are almost as potent as the whole natural hormone ; in other ways they are still more potent . <P> <P> The natural hormone works like a shotgun and often has a variety of undesirable effects , stimulating the adrenal glands , for example , to produce excesses of other body-controlling hormones . The synthetic short-chain kind offers doctors the hope that it may be used to achieve a specific result in treating a specific disease . Manufactured ACTH can be used to reduce fat stores in the body and possibly to stimulate red-cell production . <P> Supply &; Demand . With the isolation of HGH , Dr. Li pointed the way toward effective treatment of children dwarfed because of a defect in their pituitary glands . But he is well aware of the difficulties still ahead before such treatment will be practical . Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat humans , but growth hormone from lower animals has no effect on human subjects . HGH that can be used on humans must be obtained from humans who have just died-a source that is not likely ever to meet the demand . <P> The difficulties of synthesizing the hormone promise to be immense ; HGH , which contains 256 amino acids , is far more complex than ACTH . But Dr. Li is learning more about it with every experiment . Most recently , he injected HGH into a female monkey , causing her to give milk , even though she had not been pregnant . Now Dr. Li is convinced that the hormone does double duty , controlling not only human growth but almost certainly lactation as well . <P> <P> * From 1946 through 1960 , the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation , in cooperation with the American Pulbic Health Association , annually gave several awards of up to $5,000 each . <P> Now Samuel Broniman , Seagram 's head , bankrolls the A.P.H.A. <P> awards , while the Lasker Foundation independently gives two of $10,000 each , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
