Even before Blake suggested that Protestantism should consider the impact of Roman Catholic renewal on the ecumenical movement , the World Council of Churches was acting on the need . At the end of its annual meeting last week in Enugu , Nigeria , the council 's 100-man Central Committee voted to establish with the Vatican a joint working committee to discover areas of interfaith cooperation . <P> Justification for the historic step came from Swiss Reformed Theologian Lukas Vischer , 34 , in a report on the third session of the Vatican Council . Vischer , a World Council observer at Vatican II since its beginning , argued that despite the reluctance of some conservative Catholics to build links with other churches , the council 's decree on ecumenism " is an obvious effort to overcome the estrangement of centuries and bring about a relationship of mutual respect and understanding . Whether we like it or not , we find ourselves in fellowship with the Roman Catholic Church . Withdrawal into our own domestic affairs is simply out of the question . We must work for dialogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " dialogue should begin here and now . " <P> The committee agreed . Without a dissenting vote the church representatives decided to set up an eight-man working group that will eventually meet with a six-man committee appointed by the Vatican to discuss such issues as collaboration in charitable endeavors , joint theological studies on ecumenical relations , ways to resolve such abrasive interfaith problems as mixed marriages and religious liberty . The central committee also approved the idea of a regular exchange of visits between Rome and World Council headquarters in Geneva , which could lead to an exchange of permanent representatives . <P> All this , of course , was subject to agreement by the Vatican . But of that there seemed little doubt , since the World Council proposal had been approved in principle by the Vatican 's Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity during six months of secret discussion last year . Said French Dominican Theologian Jrome Hamer , one of Rome 's official observers at Enugu : " Beyond all doubt , this is a step forward . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
