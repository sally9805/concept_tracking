" Listen , Almighty , with all your might , " cries the speaker , shouting her furious prayer over the orchestra 's anguished scream . " You show me nothing at all , " she tells God , and the orchestra blares Amen . But that seems a bit stiff . <P> " Have I hurt you , Father ? " she inquires , then offers him the comfort of a nice lullaby . As the song ends , cosmic loneliness returns , and the existential monologue continues with the orchestra fast on its heels . At last a kind of accommodation is achieved . " We are in this thing together , " the speaker tells God . " You and I. " <P> <P> Taking such a sharp and familiar tone with God would be called chutzpah in Yiddish , but what Leonard Bernstein intended for his Third Symphony was a musical statement of Kaddish , the Jewish prayer for the dead . Bernstein 's Kaddish was commissioned for the Boston Symphony Orchestra 's 75th anniversary eight years ago , but it was not until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrible sense of imminent destruction , " and finally buckled down to work . Last week Boston finally played its Kaddish . <P> Curious Whimper . The 50-minute work , performed without interruption , is more an oratorio than a symphony , with speaker ( Bernstein 's wife , Actress Felicia Montealegre ) , soprano ( Jennie Tourel ) , the New England Conservatory Chorus , the Columbus Boychoir and a drastically altered orchestra : 17 string players were crowded off the platform to make way for a percussion section that had to man five timpani , three side drums , a bass drum , four kinds of cymbals , a tam-tam , three bongos , three temple blocks , a wood block , sandpaper blocks , rasp , whip , ratchet , triangle , maracas , claves , tambourine , chimes , glockenspiel , xylophone , vibraphone , celesta , piano and harp . Charles Munch , God bless him , conducted . <P> With such an ensemble , the Boston was committed to Kaddish up to its ears . Bernstein had come to town to cajole and kibitz while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Charles , " Lenny called down from the balcony , then finally took the baton himself for one of the last run-throughs . " Wonderful ! Marvelous ! Beyond my greatest expectation ! " Lenny cried when all was ready . And indeed , when the music dissolved into the curious whimper that closes the work , Boston 's well-dowagered matinee audience gave Bernstein and all the performers a nonstop 15-minute ovation . <P> Sheepish Thunder . Boston liked Kaddish better than Tel Aviv did when Bernstein took it there for its December premiere . Few Israelis could accept what they called " this American Kaddish " ; when the cantor chants the Kaddish in the synagogue , it is with a cry , not with the hand-clapping Lenny prescribed for the choruses . Said one Israeli critic : " It 's philosophy , it 's drama , it may even be music , but it certainly is not Kaddish. "
