When working on a piece of music , says Roy Harris , " the composer must have hold of something that concerns him above all else . It must bug him , must wake him up at 3 in the morning . " What bugged Harris as he was writing his Eleventh Symphony was " the restlessness , apprehension , frustration , anger , hate that permeate our world - the sense that a new era is upon us . It is hard to describe in words . " <P> Unfortunately , it is also hard to describe in music . Harris ' symphony , given its world premire in Manhattan last week by the New York Philharmonic , has many qualities that have made Harris , at 70 , an important American composer : logical structure , transparent textures and a broad melodic sense . Yet in the performance of the somewhat underrehearsed Philharmonic-under Harris ' unpracticed baton-the mainspring that should have wound the work into a powerful coil of tension remained slack . Only the opening section of the 20-minute piece , with its urgent string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the second section , an elegiac fugue turned slowly on itself , then began to meander . <P> Harris intended the final section to " get brighter , and end with optimism for the Great Society which we hope to get . " Over crashing percussion , the music mounted in overlapping panels of winds and strings . But it all seemed pumped up ; and the amplified piano vibrations that ended the work were like the rasp of escaping air as the climax , the theme of hope , and the listener 's expectations all deflated at once .
