Dibrom is morbid spelled backward . <P> Happily , it is also one of many pest controls that can keep gardens green with out the dangers of DDT and similar chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides . <P> Others are helpfully summarized in the current issue of Cry California , an eco logically astute magazine that deserves to be better known outside its state . <P> The best defense against common pests , says Cry California , is simply to keep the garden well watered , fed and weeded . A strong blast of water from the garden hose is often effective against leafhoppers and spittlebugs . Such nat ural predators as birds , ladybugs and lacewings wreak havoc with aphids , caterpillars and oak moths . When poisons must be used , the problem is how to avoid overkill . The preferred pesticides are " botanicals , " or natural poisons extracted from plants-for example , nicotine sulphate , rotenone and pyrethrum . Their effectiveness , though , is limited to certain chewing pests and sucking insects , such as Diabrotica and thrips . Some synthetic poisons , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also more persistent . The newest synthetic poisons are the highly toxic " systemics " ( Di-syston and Meta-systox-R ) , which kill sucking pests after being absorbed by plants . On the market for only two years , systemics may eventually prove undesirable for garden use . <P> Thoughtful gardeners should choose the least toxic control available ; if it is a poison , they should buy the smallest quantity necessary . Above all , says Cry California , swear off DDT and other chlorinated hydrocarbons . The ecosystem you save will be your own .
