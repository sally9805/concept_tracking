LANDOWSKA ON MUSIC by Wanda Landowska , edited and translated by Denise Restout and Robert Hawkins . 434 pages . Stein &; Day . $12.50 . <P> Few who heard her could forget her . Wanda Landowska saw to that . A tiny black-clad priestess , palms pressed together in prayer , she would float in hushed silence to her altar , the harpsichord . A Romantic who played pre-Romantic music , she got shadings and majestic effects seemingly impossible on her instrument , and no one could equal her in bringing to independent life Bach 's intertwined melodies . She took great liberties in interpretation , serenely confident of the backing of the dead composer . " You continue to play Bach your way , " she told one musician . " I shall continue to play Bach his way . What I do is comparable to the improvisations of a good jazz band , " she explained . " Did Bach , Couperin and Scarlatti play the harpsichord to preserve historical truth or because on this instrument they were able to express passion , joy or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years ago , aged 80 , leaving behind a legacy of great recordings and the articles , scoldings , commentaries and penses that are now gathered together in this book . <P> She writes about composers and their works as familiarly as she would about people in her family , which of course they were . Scarlatti , she says , " is the only composer who reminds me of the playfulness of a cat , and he does not suffer from this comparison . We all have seen a kitten play with a twig . It is impossible to describe its grace , charm , vivacity and inventiveness . " Couperin 's work , she observed , has " an immutable and restricted frame . He moves in it with ease , as did the actresses and dancers of the past , even though they were tightly laced in their corsets . " As for Saint-Sans , she noted that he was considered a master of form . " Yes , the form is there , bright , like latticework . But there is nothing in it !

" She insisted that " the idea of objectivity is Utopian . Can the music of any composer maintain its integrity after passing through the living complex-sanguine or phlegmatic-of this or that interpreter ? " But at the same time an artist must not go out of bounds , warns Landowska , reminded of the time Gounod had to chide his wife at a funeral : " Be careful ; do not cry louder than the widow ! " <P> It was Landowska alone who decided how loud to cry . When a critic complained that he could not follow her in a certain rubato , she thought , " I am perfectly happy , alone with my rubato . Why should you follow me ? " Nor did she welcome ghostly interference , however distinguished the ghost might be .
