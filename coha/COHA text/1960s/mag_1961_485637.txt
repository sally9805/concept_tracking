M R. H. L. MENCKEN in his sagacious " Prefaces " announces the discovery that Bernard Shaw is a purveyor of platitudes . What Mr. Mencken really means is that the ripe and disciplined intelligence of a tragically small minority has achieved some sort of contemporaneousness with Shaw 's thinking and lacks only his articulateness . One wonders , nevertheless , whether Mr. Mencken has descended often enough from his dwelling place of intellectual aloofness and scorn to listen to the ordinary talk of people admittedly not illiterate on , let us say , the war , or the economic problems of the world , or art , or morals . It is not the least among the great qualities of Bernard Shaw that he knows what the world is like , that his has never been a fugitive and cloistered virtue , that he has never slunk out of the dust and heat of the race . And hence the evil days that have come upon us and that have tarnished so many escutcheons of the spirit have found him erect and incorruptible , the master of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above all , in " Heartbreak House " is the rare and consoling vision of that just man of the Roman poet whom , tenacious of his purpose , neither the fury of citizens demanding evil things nor the countenance of a menacing tyrant has power to shake in his well-founded mind . " All great truths , " Shaw announces , " begin as blasphemies . " He proceeds to utter in his own person the brave , necessary blasphemies of the moment concerning the delirium of war , the vulgar attack on Germany 's share in the spiritual life of mankind , the true nature of the unspeakable peace . Truths of a more startling but also of a more permanent character he presents as having been arrived at through the living experience of people in the grip of the historic process . There is O'Flaherty , the Irish V. C. , who dared not tell his mother that he was fighting with the English . " She says , " he confides to the local squire and pillar of the Empire , " all the English generals is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost tribes of the house of Israel and the chosen people of God . " The squire is puzzled and outraged . But O'Flaherty has , to all appearances , the soft answer that turneth away wrath : " Yes , sir , she 's pig-headed and obstinate ; there 's no doubt about it . She 's like the English ; they think there 's no one like themselves . It 's the same with the Germans , though they 're educated and ought to know better . You 'll never have a quiet world till you knock the patriotism out of the human race . " There is Annajanska , the Bolshevik empress in the exuberant intellectual farce of that name . Into the hopeless muddle of political authoritarians , vacil-. lating between the orthodox sources of power , a king and a majority , she flings her electric perception of that reality from which she derives her right to act : " Some energetic and capable minority must always be in power . - Well , I am on the side of the energetic minority whose principles I agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but its aims are my aims . Therefore I stand for the Revolution . " " Heartbreak House " was written before the war . It is the longest as well as the most important play in this volume . It is softer in tone than many of Shaw 's plays ; it is , for him , extraordinarily symbolistic in fable and structure ; it has a touch of weariness under the unflagging energy of its execution . He had seen , more clearly perhaps than any other European , the inescapable shipwreck ahead . He saw a society divided between " barbarism and Capua " in which " power and culture were in separate compartments . " " Are we , " asks the half-mythical Captain Shotover , " are we to be kept forever in the mud by these hogs to whom the universe is nothing but a machine for greasing their bristles and filling their snouts ? " His children and their friends played at love and art and even at theories of social reconstruction . Meanwhile the ship of state drifted . " The captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " drinking bottled ditch-water , and the crew is gambling in the forecastle . " " We sit here talking , " another character remarks , " and leave everything to Mangan the capitalistic swindler and to chance and to the devil . " It is precisely the same reproach against pre-war Europe that Andreas Latzko expresses with such ringing intensity in " The Judgment of Peace . " Shaw prophetically represents the great catastrophe as breaking in its most vivid and terrible form upon Heartbreak House . In the result of the symbolical air-raid he sounds a note of fine and lasting hope . The " two burglars , the two practical men of business " are blown to atoms . So is the parsonage . " The poor clergyman will have to get a new house . " There is left the patient idealist who pities the poor fellows in the Zeppelin because they are driven toward death by the same evil forces ; there are left those among the loiterers in Heartbreak House who are capable of a purging experience and a revolution of the soul . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the days of the great upheaval of the world " the numskull " would not win . The playlets of the war . itself are the records of his bitter disillusion . He remembers that Shakespeare compared man to an angry ape , that Swift rebuked the Yahoo with the superior virtues of the horse ; and he sees an army that went forth to " destroy the militarism of Zabern " busy in Cologne " imprisoning every German who does not salute a British officer " ; and sees the victors , their swelling moral phrases unsilenced , " starving the enemies who had thrown down their arms . " It is not to be expected that " Heartbreak House " will add to its author 's fame and influence today . The people who admired his incisive thinking and his brilliant speech when both could be safely taken as fire-works in the void will not easily forgive his rending the veils of all their protective delusions . We shall be told , we are already being told , with a cunning and useful shirking of the issues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these plays will not " play " ( care being taken not to make the experiment ) , and that , at best , he is the easy jester shaking the negligible bells upon his pointed cap . The truth is , of course , that Shaw is a great comic dramatist who has , at times , followed the classical methods of comedy by confronting shams with realities , man 's fraudulent gestures with his hidden self , but who , at other times , has invented the new method of presenting on the stage a battle of those naked ideas that struggle for mastery in the minds of men . His best plays quiver with dramatic life and play superbly before audiences who have risen to a perception of the overwhelming reality of their conflicts . To the supporters of melodrama and sentimental comedy they are meaningless . But what , in the whole world of art and thought , is not ? " Heartbreak House " will not , it is possible , ultimately rank with Shaw 's best work ; it is worthy of all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
