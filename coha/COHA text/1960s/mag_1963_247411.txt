Tom Jones . " I have endeavoured in the following History , " wrote Henry Fielding in The History of Tom Jones , a Foundling , " to laugh Mankind out of their favourite Follies and Vices . " Two centuries have passed : Mankind still has its favourite Vices : and Novelist Fielding 's sprawling , brawling masterpiece still stands as the greatest comic novel in the language . Now Britain 's Tony Richardson ( The Entertainer , A Taste of Honey ) has made the novel into an absolutely magnificent movie . The film is a way-out , walleyed , wonderful exercise in cinema . It is also a social satire written in blood with a broadaxe . It is bawdy as the British were bawdy when a wench had to wear five petticoats to barricade her virtue . It is as beautiful in Eastman Color as England is in spring . And it is one of the funniest farces anybody anywhere has splattered on a screen since Hollywood lost the recipe for custard pie . <P> " Upon my word , " said Coleridge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect plots ever planned . " It is also one of the most intricate ; a film of the full book might take six hours to show . Director Richardson and Scenarist John Osborne decided to tell the whole story - well , almost-but tell it so fast that six hours of hilarity are squeezed into two . And let the gasping customers fall where they may . <P> In a mad little prologue , shown as a silent film with title frames inserted and a hurdy-gurdy hammering in the background , tiny Tom is found luxuriously " abandoned " in Squire Allworthy 's bed and is instantly adopted by the dear old fellow ( George Devine ) . In the next scene Tom ( Albert Finney ) is already pushing 20-not to mention the voluptuous daughter ( Diane Cilento ) of his uncle 's gamekeeper . Five minutes after that the audience knows all about the beauteous Sophie Western ( Susannah York ) , Tom 's light-o ' - love : about Squire Western , her apoplectic pa ; and about that slimy fellow Blifil , who considers Tom a rival for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy with pimples can hate a boy all the girls adore . <P> Within an hour the vicious villain has slandered the hero 's good name , persuaded the gullible Allworthy to disown him , extracted from Squire Western a promise that Sophie will become his bride instead of Tom 's . Appalled , Sophie flees to London , whither Tom is also bound . Western and Blifil set out in hot pursuit , and the next hour is crammed with all manner of violent and absurd adventures : desperate duels , rascally robberies , satanic stranglings , egregious escapes , and any number of precipitate plunges into a fate nobody seems to consider worse than death . At the climax poor dear Sophie is about to be raped and poor brave Tom has his neck in a noose and- <P> Courage , Dear Reader ! Lo and Behold are Fielding 's favorite characters , and Richardson makes frequent and gloriously funny use of them . His actors catch the spirit of the thing from the first scene , and they have a picnic . The characters are rumbustious caricatures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finney is Tom clean through-a fine strapping country boy whose heart is in the right place even when his foremost interest is n't . But Hugh Griffith is the man to watch . A tankard in one hand , a buttock in the other , Squire Western superbly defines a type not quite extinct : the aboriginal Tory , John Bull in his own barnyard.
