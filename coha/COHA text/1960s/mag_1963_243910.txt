THE SEC 's second look at the nation 's 14 stock exchanges concentrates on the role of a largely anonymous but highly influential army of " inside " professionals . The 65 reforms proposed in the SEC report center on five types of these market insiders , whose functions affect all investors but are rarely understood by the public . The five : <P> Over-the-Counter Traders <P> These men deal in the issues of 11,000 companies that are not listed on any exchange . Unlisted issues are often the sharply curving " glamour " stocks , but they also include some solid shares of major companies that do not wish to be bound by the exchanges ' strict reporting rules . Over-the-counter trading has increased 700% since World War II , and accounted for roughly 38% of the $103 billion worth of stock sales in 1961 . Some 1,100 stock wholesalers operate in the O-T-C market . When a broker places an order for a customer , the wholesaler either draws the unlisted stock from his own portfolio ( each wholesaler " makes markets " in several issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deal . Since there is no clearing house , no ticker tape and scant supervision , ample room exists for imaginative wheeling and dealing . <P> Odd-Lot Traders <P> They handle the small investors ' orders for lots of fewer than 100 shares . Odd-lot trading makes up 9% of the volume on the New York Stock Exchange , and 99% of all these transactions are handled by two firms : Carlisle &; Jacquelin and DeCoppett &; Doremus . Brokers place their odd-lot orders with these two firms , which usually sell the shares from their own portfolios at the going market price , plus a fractional markup . Together , the two firms in 1961 earned $12 million on a gross of $35 million . <P> Stock Specialists <P> Each of these middlemen is assigned by the exchange to " specialize " in several stocks and stabilize their prices by buying when prices are falling sharply and selling when they are rising swiftly . On the New York Stock Exchange where they account for 30% of all transactions 353 specialists belong to 107 firms . Each firm usually handles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; <P> Co. - has 45 . To become a Big Board specialist , a man must pass three examinations , own a seat on the exchange ( current price : $205,000 ) , pay post rentals and fees of $1,300 to $6,300 a year . Specialists make about half their profits from commissions as floor brokers for other firms ( average commission : $3.85 per 100 shares ) , and half by trading for their personal accounts . Specialists pay only tiny commissions on their personal trades , are allowed to buy on a low 25% margin v. 50% for others . They often buy a big block of shares one minute and sell it the next for a profit in fractions . <P> <P> Short Sellers <P> Professional bears , they are usually big round-lot ( 100 shares or more ) speculators who wager that the market will drop . They borrow stock through other brokers and sell it at , say , $10 a share , hoping to replace the borrowed shares later by buying them back at a lower price , perhaps $5 .
