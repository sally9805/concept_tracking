" One other speaker gave the tax qualified support because , he said , there was " no alternative . " Apart from these two , the opposition , representing scores of organizations , was unanimous . Republicans and Democrats and Liberals and Conservatives , as well as Communists , lino up in opposition to the higho sales tax at the eight-hour hea , I ing in City Hall , jammed 700 at the opening . Proposals Varied Management and labor were against it , and so were big business and the little shopkeeper . The big chambers of commerce and the neighborhood civic associations joined the chorus of protest . As blanket as the criticism I was , nothing resembling a consensus developed on how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get by increasing the sales tax from 3 to 4 per cent . Many urged paring the $3 , - 093,461,582 budget , but few got down to specifics . Others proposed taxes that would require approval by the Legislature before they could be voted by the city .

A clear indication on how the hearing would go was provided in the testimony of the first witness , Ben Davidson , executive director of the Liberal party .

" He criticized the Rockefeller state administration for putting the city in a " cruel predicament .
