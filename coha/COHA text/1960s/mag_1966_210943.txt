Louisville 's Brown-Forman Distillers Corp . has never cared much for blends in either its whiskey or its top management . Ever since Founder George Garvin Brown began bottling Old Forester in 1870 , the company has stuck to top-grade bourbons and to a Brown in charge of its headquarters in Kentucky 's bluegrass country . Last week Brown-Forman varied the recipe . To succeed third-generation President George Garvin Brown , who is moving to the chairmanship on the retirement of his older ( by six years ) brother W. L. Lyons Brown , 60 , the company picked Executive Vice President Daniel L. Street , 62 . <P> A onetime Louisville attorney , Street was Brown-Forman 's general counsel for nine years before he became a vice president in 1947 . Since then , he has been one of the Brown brothers ' chief lieutenants in the one area where their taste is as sharp as it is for bourbon : profits . By sticking with such high-quality , wide-profit-margin labels as Early Times and Jack Daniel 's Old Time Tennessee Sour Mash Whiskey , the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Seagram ( 1965 sales : $1 billion ) . With sales of $154 million for the twelve months that ended in April , Brown-Forman distilled record profits of $10.3 million . <P> Brown-Forman started diversifying in 1956 , when it paid $20 million for the 54-bbl. - a- day Jack Daniel Distillery , which has been located in the same quiet mountain glen near Lynchburg , Tenn. , for a hundred years . The Daniel output has , under Brown-Forman management , been doubled , though it still far from meets the demand for what some drinkers regard as the best sippin ' whiskey of all . The company now sells Usher 's Scotch , Bols liqueurs and imported wines as well , and Street 's main job will be to look out for other likely acquisitions . <P> The Brown family , which bought up Partner John Forman 's interest in 1902 , still owns 74% of the company stock , worth $70 million . Chairman George Garvin 's cousin and heir apparent , Robinson S. Brown Jr. , 49 , succeeded Street as executive vice president .
