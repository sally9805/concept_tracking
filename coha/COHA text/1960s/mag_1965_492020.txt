THE BARE-LEGGED platinum blonde , her face wan , her hair falling in her face , sat in a detention cell of the Criminal Courts Building in New York . Two dozen women arrested the night before  --  prostitutes , vagrants and narcotics suspects  --  sat beside her on wooden benches , awaiting booking . None of them suspected that the disheveled blonde was actress Carroll Baker , and that studio press agents had planted her in their midst as a publicity stunt for a new movie . Several days earlier , Manhattan tabloids had headlined the uncovering of an East Side vice ring , and the other prisoners apparently believed Miss Baker had been seized in that raid . When a photographer who was in on the stunt moved toward the bars to snap Carroll 's picture , the prisoners formed a protective circle , shielding her with their hands . " Cover your face , baby , " one of them shouted . " Do n't let that guy see you , or it 'll go hard for you in court . " Miss Baker 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed during a recent series of investigations , all heavily chaperoned , into the seamier side of life . The results of her experiences in prisons and pickup joints may be seen this month in the film Sylvia . The movie traces the unhappy history of a rehabilitated female hustler . As an adolescent , Sylvia is attacked by her father , deceived by a thief masquerading as a priest and then driven into prostitution . She eventually becomes New York 's leading $100-a-visit call girl , only to be beaten and disfigured by one of her clients . The Catholic Legion of Decency , prior to the release of the film , called it " objectionable in part for all . " Sylvia serves as the latest in a series of roles that have established Miss Baker as a reigning sex symbol . For the past two years , and with unflagging dedication , Carroll has pursued a high-powered publicity campaign almost totally based upon the photographic sport of peekaboo . An alumna of Actors Studio , Carroll frolicked in the nude last December for Playboy magazine . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Playboy for one million By RICHARD WARREN LEWIS Photographs by Bill Bridges CARROLL BAKER dollars in damages . charging breach of contract , violation of privacy and defamation of character for the unauthorized use of her likeness . To capitalize on the topless-bathingsuit fad. she posed for a wire-service photographer beside the pool at her S250.000 Beverly Hills home , arms demurely folded across her chest . When producer Joseph E. Levine paid S100.000 last year for the bestselling Irving Shulman biography , Harlow , and announced that Miss Baker would star in the movie , this set off a new beating of drums to sell Carroll as Harlow reincarnate . Miss Baker has imitated Harlow in undress , makeup and coiffure for painters in Paris and partygoers on the Queen Mary . She startled newsmen at a Beverly Hills cocktail party by emerging from a 1932 Isotta-Fraschini limousine groomed to look just like Jean Harlow . She even sported an artificial mole beneath her lower lip . Imitating Harlow , she has displayed herself at movie premieres or parties in an assortment of diaphanous , backless , frontless and translucent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around her bedroom . Her maid was once Harlow 's maid . Last December . the Baker home was robbed of S11,600 in furs , costume jewelry and currency . Miss Baker took full advantage of the theft . Dressed in a plunging neckline , she smiled sensuously for the press and the police while bemoaning her loss . Although the theatrics inevitably aroused some suspicion in the film capital , four days later the culprits were apprehended . To celebrate , Carroll draped a recovered , S5,000 mink cape over her shoulders while newsreel and still cameras recorded the scene for posterity . One gossip columnist nominated Carroll as " Miss Anything for Publicity . " Frequently this relentless pursuit of ballyhoo conceals Miss Baker 's dedication as an actress . The series of attention-getting stunts she participated in for Sylvia certainly were inspired in large part by publicity , but there was also another aim  --  research for her role . packed a suitcase containing two garish kimonos , a baby-blue negligee , a satin robe , a revealing black knit dress , a Spanish-English dictionary and a gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisked her from the palm-lined streets of Beverly Hills . Paramount Pictures . the eager sponsor of Miss Baker 's journey , had arranged for a unique Tijuana welcoming committee of one , a 20-year-old lady of negotiable virtue . Seated on an ornately carved bed , the girl discussed pay scale , dress and working conditions with Carroll . Then the two ladies repaired to a garish , neon-lit cabaret , where local hustlers plied their trade . Carroll 's companion wore a tight , black satin dress with one shoulder bared , crystal beads that hung down to her waist , white patent-leather shoes and a matching pocketbook . ( Hollywood designer Edith Head later adapted this outfit for Miss Baker 's wardrobe in Sylvia . ) Carroll dressed simply in her black , wool-knit dress , waist cincher and backless white shoes . Her bleached hair glimmered in the overhead spotlights bathing the dance floor . " She looks more like a hustler than any broad in the place , " said the admiring cabaret owner to a hovering Paramount press agent . Carroll and the girl sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The girls ordered cherry-colored soda water in tall glasses , snapped their fingers to the beat of a rock-'n ' - roll combo and idly watched Mary Lou . a gum-chewing dancer of Aztec lineage , whose measurements were whimsically announced as 44-44-44 . Carroll 's Mexican companion explained that a B girl was obliged to promote 12 drinks nightly before she could leave the club with a man . Carroll nervously waited for the action . often glancing at an electric clock over the bar which advertised Bubble Up . In the background , an adenoidal singer droned Ray Charles 's It 's All Right . Finally , two off-duty sailors from San Diego joined the girls at the table . " You speak English ? " one of them asked Miss Baker , while a nimble waiter took orders for tequila drinks all around . " I saw you the minute you came through the door , " the sailor continued . " You look very young . " " I am very young , " Carroll replied . " I 'm pretty young too , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put his arm around her waist and drained the diluted drink that had cost him a dollar . " I 'm a little older than that , " responded the 33-year-old Miss Baker . " I 'm twenty-four . " " How many disappointing love affairs have you had ? " the sailor asked . Carroll blinked , but did not answer . " What did you go to California for , " he said , " to be a movie star ? " Yes . " Carroll replied . I do n't understand why you did n't make it , " he said . " They do n't have anybody as beautiful as you . It 's a tough racket . " He held her hands and told her they were cold . The waiter cleared off the girls ' untouched drinks and took orders for another round . " Hey , play something slow , " he yelled to the combo. " / want to dance with the blonde . " Miss Baker 's press agent , drinking beer at a neighboring table , became alarmed . He motioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by leading her to the dance floor . Gamely , she kicked off her heels and twisted vigorously as three amplified guitars laid down a heavybeated version of Tequila , No one in the audience looked surprised . " You 're really the most beautiful girl I ever saw , " the sailor continued , when Carroll returned to the table . Her face remained blank as she kept time to the music with a swizzle stick . " But , gee , you act strange , " he said . Miss Baker shrugged . Then she and her 20-year-old coach excused themselves and departed from the club , leaving the sailors with the check . " I was very touched by that boy , " Carroll said later . " But I thought that once he got started dancing , I did n't know how far he would go . He 'll probably see Sylvia in a drive-in movie and have the upsetting feeling that he . has seen me somewhere before . " Back in Hollywood , Carroll and Paramount officials added some of her recollections ? wild dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the merchandise  --  to the script . " The actors in that scene are going to be very young , " said Carroll . " That made a great impression on me , the fact that those kids were so young . I learned something from the Mexican girl too . I was impressed by her sweetness , almost a na  --  vet ? . She had this great CARROLL BAKER to be fine tomorrow . " Two weeks later Carroll arrived in New York for the premiere of her movie , The Carpetbaggers , and , on a more rarefied plane , the further pursuit of her research for Sylvia . First she worked for an hour as a waitress in the London Grill of a Brass Rail restaurant . seeking insight for a waitress sequence in Sylvia . She donned a black-and-white uniform , and served a family of five a full meal . ' ' She 's not bad . " said maitre d ' Larry Caringi . " I 've had worse waitresses . " The customers did not recognize Carroll , even though their table was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next , she put in a brief stint behind the cashier 's cage at Hubert 's Museum , a Times Square penny arcade . While rifles cracked in the shooting gallery and passersby recorded their voices for 35 cents , Carroll mechanically changed dollar bills . Again she went unnoticed . That night . to provide elegant contrast to the Tijuana B girl , Paramount Pictures executives introduced Miss Baker to an East Side call girl . The studio had hired her for $250 to talk about her profession . The girl , a six-foot-two-inch New Zealander who used the name Aileen , was leery at first . But then , for nearly two hours , she and Miss Baker chatted in a luxury suite at a midtown hotel , discussing the motivations. anxieties and procedures of a call girl . Aileen told sad stories of men who had cheated her . A number of times she had been paid by checks which later bounced . Her recitation , most of it unprintable , was recorded on a hidden tape machire . " I enjoy talking to men , " Aileen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ f know one man who gives me custom-made shoes . I know another man who is in the garment business who gives me new clothes . The other day I met a man from Chicago . He gives me jewelry . He thinks he 's falling in love with me . But how can I get marTied ? What would we ever talk about ? " I like to live . I never worry . But I do feel quite lonely at times , because I do n't really have anyone . I 'm giving them something more than they 're giving me . That 's for sure . " Aileen glanced at her appointment book and made several phone calls . Later that evening , she reported , a wild party would be held at a midtown hotel . She asked Miss Baker to accompany her . Miss Baker declined . Instead , the two girls decided to tour some East Side pickup joints . Fearing she would be recognized , Carroll covered her hair with a brunet wig . Her dress was white and low cut . A limousine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East Side bar . Unattached men and women stood eight deep inside . " If some guy picks me up , " Miss Baker whispered facetiously , " I 'll just ask him to come out to my chauffeured limousine . " But no man asked her . Those who talked to the girls took an instant fancy to Aileen and ignored Carroll . The same thing happened in half a dozen other bars . Later Aileen turned to Miss Baker and said : " Blondes do have more fun , do n't you think ? " " I could n't get arrested tonight , " said Carroll . Two days later , however , with the cooperation of police , she did get arrested . Clad in a black skirt , white blouse , wraparound sun glasses and leopard-skin sandals , Carroll was taken to the Criminal Courts Building where she stolidly answered the roll call as Sylvia West . She walked through the pretrial examination and processing , and was led along with the others into a grim detention cell . Here she talked with a teen-ager who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " the girl asked softly . " Uptown , " Carroll replied . " Where do you work ? " " Delancey Street , " she said . " This is the seventh time I 'm in here . " " Why do you keep doing it ? " Carroll asked . The girl said nothing . She merely rolled back the sleeve of her dress and revealed an ugly array of needle marks . " I 've been on it since I was fifteen , " she murmured , Subsequently , a police limousine , its siren wailing , hustled Miss Baker to her next stop , the Women 's House of Detention in Greenwich Village . The 34-year-old , dirty-orange-brick building has housed such tenants as atom spy Ethel Rosenberg and Communist leader Elizabeth Gurley Flynn , but today the prison is crowded with narcotics addicts whohaveembraced prostitution . Carroll exchanged her skirt and blouse for a plain checked dress that smelled of disinfectant She signed the prison register , and a notation of " 887.4a , vagrancy and prostitution " was added after her name . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roam the upper floors of the institution . Members of one cell block noted her V.I.P. treatment and jeered . " Oh , come on , " one woman shouted , " you 're supposed to look sad . " Another chimed in : " Close the door and see how she feels behind bars . " Carroll witnessed teen-aged dope addicts withdrawing , sprawled in the corners of their cells on another floor . She wound up in the dispensary , asking for aspirin . Perspiring noticeably . Carroll left the prison and was driven to her hotel . " The only time I was really scared and wanted to back out was in that jail , " she later said . " It 's certainly been an experience , all of this . Holy God . " She had just enough time to pack her belongings , change into a $400 matching Balmain suit and hat , and resume her personal-appearance tour for The Carpetbaggers . Less than 12 hours later she walked off a plane in Pittsburgh , wearing jewels , an ermine wrap and a beaded gown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character like that right into another , " she said unblushingly . " It was strange  --  coming back from the depths of the real world into the cream-puff existence that I lead . " Safely back home . Miss Baker again met with the producer and director of Sylvia . The movie 's staff studied photographs of Carroll taken with concealed cameras in jail , in the cocktail lounges and in the Mexican cabaret . " The producers liked the unkempt way my hair looked in the photographs . " Carroll said . " and I wound up wearing it the same way in the picture . The director liked some of the expressions I had on my face in jail . And we improved the jail sequence in the script , adding women who look more like men than women . They were everywhere . " It also was decided to film the picture in stark black and white instead of color , as originally planned . The day before the Sylvia filming began , Carroll sat in her freshly painted studio dressing room , munching on a tossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent poured her coffee . She was on the verge of signing a seven-picture contract with producer Joseph E. Levine which would enrich her by at least five million dollars . " To invent something on the screen is no good , " she said . " People talk about doing something like this trip I made , but not everybody does it . It takes a certain amount of guts , of really wanting to live in this world and understand things . What I want to give the public is something real . " El
