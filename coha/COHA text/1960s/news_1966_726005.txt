txt The city 's Federally financed program to eliminate adult illiteracy is threatened with a shutdown because of a lack of funds . Almost 20,000 adults who are learning the ? three R 's under this year-old project may have to be told early next year that the promise to make them employable has been a mirage . The project , called the Adult Basic Education Program , has been considered a key instrument of the antipoverty campaign . Now it has virtually run out of money because Congress , which transferred the program from the Office of Economic Opportunity to th .... United States Office of Education during its last session , reduced appropriations for the program by 25 per cent . In Washington , however , spokesmen for the program ' said that New York appeared ( simply to have been overspend ' ing , apparently in the mistaken HECHINGER belief that funds that were in tended for the entire year were only a partial appropriation. , They , . agreed that if New York had already spent all the ' 1966-67 money it might well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of the division of adult education in the United States Office of Education , explained that New , York State education authori- , ties might have been misled by , the fact that the original meas- , ure called for $40-million for the nationwide program , whereas Congress authorized only $30-million . The New York director of the Bureau of Basic Continuing Education said : " It had been our hope that additional funds might be appropriated for this program and that our original allocation might be increased . " Mr , Pagano said last night that Congress might , of course , // provide additional funds on an emergency basis early next year but that no such promise had been made . While it is evident that New York failed to heed Washington 's warnings that antipoverty education funds- would be reduced , those who operate the programs locally seem to feel that such reductions can not be made without taking the steam out of the newly created program . " We are frustrated , " a spokesman ' for the project here said yesterday . " Just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these undereducated people , we are in danger of having to call a halt . " Already seriously curtailed , the project is expected to run out of money in 30 to 90 days , and all classes will then have to be canceled , the spokesman at the Board of Education said . In addition to the 19,468 adults , ranging in age from 17 to 55 , who have been enrolled since the classes got under way in July , 1965 , experts estimated that as many as 700,000 illiterate or severely undereducated adults are eligible for the program here . Recruiting pupils , however , is a : low and tedious process , 6ince it is difficult to reach persons who can not read . Staff workers , therefore , pointed out that the program was in jeopardy just as the initial investment in spreading the word is beginning to pay off . Applicants were appearing in increasing number , some of them referred by friends or relatives and others by potential employers . Yet , applicants already must be told that no new classes are likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials in charge of the program and from letters written by educational authorities in Albany . An appeal for help was addressed last Tuesday to Senator Robert F. Kennedy 's office in Washington by Alfred T. Houghton , chief of the Bureau of Basic Continuing Education in the state Department of Education . The program , which utilizes regular teachers from the city system , many of whom have had intensive training for this specialized effort , has been provided in a variety of places ? in schools , churches , union halls , housing projects and store fronts . Stress is on reading and writing , but basic arithmetic and other elementary school subjects adapted to adult needs with special stress on usefulness in jobs , also are taught . Maximum Hours Cut to 15 Instruction was offered all day , from 8:30 A.M. to evening as well as on weekends , de- , pending on the students ' need and availability . Participants could enroll for any combination of time , from six hours to 25 hours a week , but the maximum has already been cut to 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half the number of hours to stretch the remaining funds . Yet , few of those who have begun their studies can be considered anywhere near the objective of making them functionally literate . Those in charge of the program fear that , if new funds are not forthcoming , the effort already expended would have been largely wasted . Even worse , they believe ; those who had in fact been promised a new start will be even more disillusioned than before . Others , who had heard of the program but were only getting ready to consider joining it , might approach future governmental education efforts with even greater suspicion than is frequently the case among the poor . 1,000 Hours Were Promised Mrs. Mary C. , assistant director of the city 's Bureau of Community Education , pointed to the promise made in the original recruiting ) literature . It said : " This is an ongoing program , which will , carry on through 1,000 hours of instruction .

The United States Commissioner of Education has been authorized to transfer " a minimal amount of funds from other titles of the same act " to the illiteracy project , Mr.1 Houghton said .
