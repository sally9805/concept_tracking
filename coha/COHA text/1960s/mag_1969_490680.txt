THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment WE have received the following handwritten communication from a man we know  --  a resolute type , with the courage of his convictions : " You will remember that more than a year ago I told you I felt as if I were drowning in information and was going to try to cut out the influence of the media on my life . By now , I 've given it a fair run , and I must say that it has had a most curious effect all round , My work as an architect has not been affected , but my life certainly has . I began by getting rid of the television set , which caused no pain , although it was at Ieast a month before I stopped noticing , Then the radios . You never know how many damn radios you have until you attempt to shut them up . My wife wanted me to keep a spare radio , in case of a crisis , but I told her that recurring crisis was the cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stutter to a stop , but the newspapers I severed abruptly , and that was the most painful thing  --  their absence left us holding great blank rectangles of time . When I had occasion to ride into the city by train , I felt improperly dressed  --  holding a book is nothing like wielding a newspaper  --  hut I found . I was reading five times as much as I used to , and not from behind . Of course , I kept seeing the headlines in the newspapers of others , so , subliminally , I had a jagged sense of what was going on in the world , but I did not go back to reading about it for myself . During the spring , I worked my way clear through an Italian course , doing all the exercises , and ended up reading Italian quite adequately . In company , my wife and I found ourselves occasionally excluded , through our ignorance , from entire conversations , until we grew skillful at keeping the subject within our ken , talking about limitless things that stemmed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters to the children , away at school . I began to learn the names of plants and trees  --  an ignorance of which I had always been ashamed . My wife became Furiously practical , cooking extravagantly , gardening , asking questions . There was a lot more time , we both felt . At first , the situation was sometimes uneasy  --  she wanting to know what I 'd heard at the office , I wondering what she was concealing  --  until we found a solution . I have two or three friends who are knowledgeable , open , and wise . Every so often , we 'd sit down with one of them and have him fill us in on what had been happening in the country , the world , space  --  everywhere  --  and he 'd tell us with great care , obviously enjoying the hardic role . And to us it did all sound like an epic poem . Even so , we found we had somehow taken in a great deal through a kind of osmosis  --  we knew what books were coming out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read about them . 1 , Ve were kidded , of course , when people caught on to what we were doing . Why not ditch the hi-fi , the telephone ? Why not till the soil ? We refused either to discuss or to explain  --  otherwise , the whole thing would have become- tiresome  --  and they dropped it . Occasionally , we still feel a hit freakish . But it has been fruitful in so many ways . I 've been reading a lot of history , and it satisfies my curiosity in the way newspapers did  --  more , in Fact , since you can see how things come out . I feel much less as if I were careering along on rails ; I feel that I have the luxury of choice . Most of all , I 've got the silence back , and I appreciate that . As for tilling the soil , my wife would do it in a flash , but I tell her that I do n't want to leave the world  --  I just want to turn down the volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle for control of the public schools has  --  at least temporarily  --  been removed from the streets and returned to the appropriate civic chambers . Having unveiled its tentative thirty-three-district plan fur the decentralization of the schools , the New York City Board of Education last week began a series of seven open hearings on its proposal , which will eventually be submitted to the legislature , and we dropped in on the first of them . It was held in the Morris W and Fannie B. Haft Auditorium of the Fashion Institute of Technology , on West Twenty-seventh Street , at ten in the morning . Because disruptions had been predicted  --  by , among others , William F. Haddad , one of the Board members  --  and because the city administration has grown understandably sensitive about discussions of educational problems , this initial session was notable for the precautions that had been taken to insure order within the auditorium , a spacious and well-appointed hall . " I do n't know who ' we 're here , " we heard a police sergeant telling a detail of patrohnen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have expected trouble , " As it turned out , the nearest thing to an incident occurred before the hearings began , when Jerome G. Kovalcik , an assistant superintendent of schools , who had arranged to have the television coverage pooled , barred a rebellious camera crew from the auditorium . A few minutes later , the session 's first , and only , heckler , a habitual critic of ? the Board of Education , stalked out after failing to arouse either the interest or the sympathy of the audience , which consisted of fifty or sixty men and women scattered among the hundreds of auditorium seats . On the stage , members and officials of the Board of Education conducted the meeting from behind a green-covered table . Because the decentralization plan was expected to arouse so much public interest , invitations to comment on it had been carefully rationed , one to an organization , and as we took our seat at a press table next to a large electric timer , John Lotz , the chairman of the special committee that had drawn up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would he called to a microphone in the center of the auditorium in the order of their invitation numbers  --  ninety-five were listed on the agenda before a scheduled dinner break  --  and each presentation would be limited to five minutes . Because of this time limit , the United Federation ? of Teachers , which had announced its opposition to the decentralization plan , decided to boycott the public hearings . How could anybody , one of its spokesmen asked , be expected to criticize comprehensively within five minutes a program that took up two pages of type in the Times ? However , as one Board of Education official pointed out , the union and the other parties that would he directly affected by the proposal had already been granted opportunities to air their views  --  at length  --  before the Board . Even without the participation of the teachers ' union , there was no lack of opposition to the decentralization plan . Curiously , the opposition was almost evenly divided between speakers who said that the plan went too far in relinquishing control of the schools to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go far enough . Of all the speakers we heard , only one gave the plan his unqualified support . " The task for us now is to secure its passage in Albany , " this speaker JANUARY 1 I , I 9 G 9 James Prendergast , a Democratic City Council candidate  --  said , and even the members of the Board of Education who had voted against the decentralization plan brightened at the momentary break in the monotony of criticism and invective . Typical of those who felt that the decentralization plan went too far were Rubin Maloff , the president of an association of high-school departmental chairmen , who maintained that New York City already has " the best public-school system in the country " and that " the press has chosen to ignore our strengths and innovative programs , " and T. H. Altrowitz , representing home-instruction teachers , who warned that the proposal to abolish the Board of Examiners would " open the door to the unqualified and the uninterested " and that " you are signing the death sentence of public education and betraying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Typical of those favoring additional decentralization were John Gallo , the administrator of the New York State Freedom and Peace Party , who charged that the Board 's proposed retention of the authority to allocate funds " gives local hoards the responsibility for the local schools but no real power to do anything with them , " and Sam Meyers , the president of a United Automobile Workers local , who asserted that " a number of young black and Puerto Rican men who seek jobs in our industry are illiterate " and that " a successful union-training program dispelled the notion that these young men are ineducable , " concluding , " The ) were deprived of essential education because they lived in a ghetto . " The most persistent presentation of the day was made by Mrs. Rosalyn Switzen , an opponent not only of decentralized school boards but also of the present centralized one . Mrs. Switzen first distributed literature calling for the suspension of the eleven Board members and then declared that the hearing was " a complete farce . " The decentralization plan , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out of committee in the Legislature . " When she was cut off by the timer 's buzzer , she claimed the right as " educational ombudsman for twenty-eight organizations " to use the time allotted to each . Mr. Lotz appeared distressed . " I would appeal to you , Mrs. Switzen , to return to your seat , " he said , looking down at his agenda , " and let 's go on to the next organization , the Gramercy Park Civic Betterment League . Is there a representative here ? " " Yes , sir , " Mrs. Switzcn said , brandishing another numbered card and plunging ahead with her argument , which soon took the form of an attack on the " specialist " characteristics of members of the Board . The schools need " generalists , " she said , and she was looking forward to the day when she would be known " not as Mrs. Switzen but as Generalist Switzcn . " " Thank you , Generalist Switzen , " Mr. Lotz said , with relief , as the buzzer sounded again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Switzen , now representing the Society of American Generalists , pulled out yet another numbered card and continued , Eventually , however , she ran out of cards and , at not quite three o'clock  --  more than two hours before the scheduled break for dinner  --  the meeting ran out of speakers . Looking around us , we saw that only a handful of proponents and opponents of centralization had stuck it out to the end , and they were now making their way quietly to the exits . On our way out , we stopped to have a word with Dr. Milton A. Galamison , one of the drafters of the decentralization plan , and the Board 's newly elected vice-president . Before his appointment to the Board , last July , Dr. Galamison was arrested more than a dozen times in connection with various school disputes . We asked him if he had an explanation for the unexpected temperateness of the public hearing we had just witnessed . " I think it 's a good sign that people do n't feel compelled to come out and shout at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there 's a new atmosphere at the Board of Education , that things are going to be all right at last . " Entomological Dinner BOTH the seventy-fifth anniversary of the incorporation of the New York Entomological Society and its recent merger with , or taking over of , the Brooklyn Entomological Society , which was founded in 1872 and incorporated in 1885 , were marked by a dinner in the Pacific Bird Hall of the American Museum of Natural History , the publication of a handsome illustrated booklet , bound in tuna-moth green , tracing the history of both societies , and , at the dinner , talks by Dr. Alexander B. Klots , a retired professor of biology-at City College and the author of " A Field Guide to the Butterflies of North America , East of the Great Plains ; " Dr. Edwin I ray Teak , the naturalist and writer ; and Dr. Vincent G Dethier , a Princeton biology professor , whose works include " Chemical Insect Attractants and Repellents " and " To Know a Fly . " " I 'm the oldest living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told us during a prefatory cocktail hour in the rotunda of the Roosevelt Memorial building , where we were attracted to a bourbon-on-the-rocks . " Our consolidation with the Brooklyn group , which was approved by the New York Supreme Court last May , means that the two oldest insect societies in the city , which have been eying each other across the East River down the decades , are united in holy wedlock . We have a junior division , the Junior Entomological Society , devoted to helping young people further their interest in entomology and allied sciences . It 's run by Alice Gray , a scientific assistant in the Museum 's Department of Entomology . Kids are natural hug enthus  --  asts . They 're nearer to the ground than grownups , and they have unending energy . " Dr. Klots introduced us to Miss Gray , who was sipping sherry , and she informed us that the Juniors got going  --  under her aegis , as senior adviser  --  ten years ago . " We 're limited to fifteen active members , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big group . Members are admitted between the ages of thirteen and seventeen , and can stay on until they 're twenty-two , but most of them drop out when they go to college . Nearly all are boys ; I have only one girl . We meet at the Museum on alternate Saturdays . %Ve have lectures by invited speakers , and workshops for the manufacture of collecting equipment , and we go on field trips . Our young people , to the astonishment of many , like to keep their specimens alive rather than to collect them . " Miss Gray was wearing earrings and a brooch that were in the shape of bees , and when we expressed admiration for them , she said that she had a collection of several hundred pieces of entomological jewelry , and also two hundred and fifty toys in the form of insects . " Three-fourths of the toys are ladybugs , " she said . " Most of the rest are butterflies . Then come bees . Very few caterpillars are jewelry pieces , hut they are common as toys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Scarabs have n't been out of fashion for five thousand years . Scarab-shaped seals go back to the fourth dynasty in Egypt . The beetle 's image was worn five thousand years ago as a charm to invoke the protection of the gods . It was adopted by the Romans after Ptolemaic times , partly because the Romans believed that all scarabs were males , and therefore ind:cated valor . " Dinner found us at a table that included Mr. Frank Rutkowski , acting secretary of the Newark Entomological Society ; Dr. Winifred Traklmas , research associate in the Museum 's Department of Animal Behavior ; and Dr. Asher E. Treat , an ex-president of the New York society and a retired biology professor at City University . " Our society was founded as the Entomologischer Verein von Newark , " Mr. Rutkowski said . " I do n't know just when . Probably in the eighteen-eighties . Mostly lepidopterists . There arc a few coleopterists . We meet twice a year , at the home of Joseph Muller , who is treasurer of the New York Entomological Society , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ octogenarian specialist in satyrid butterflies , who is an American Museum entomology research associate . We have field trips occasionally , but we 're mainly social . " " I 'm the ant lady in the Museum , " Dr. Trakimas said . " I study army ants . I have a Ph.D . from Fordhatn in male-ant anatomy . " " I 'm an acarologist , " Dr. Treat said . " Mites and ticks . I specialize in mites that live in the ears of arms , - worm and other moths . I got interested in the acoustic sense of moths in 1951 , found mites in their ears , and transferred my allegiance to the mites . The hearing of moths is supposed to be related to their ability to escape from bats , which eat them , so the moths ' hearing is in the ultrasonic range . The mites are found in only one ear . Unilateral occupancy . The presumed reason , which I am inclined to accept , is that destruction of both ears  --  the parasitic mite destroys the acoustic sense in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and therefore the mites , vulnerable to bats . The mites act as though they knew this . Even when they are terribly crowded  --  fifty or more to an ear , plus as many eggs  --  they will not go over to the other ear . They are transferred from moth to moth by flowers on whose nectar the moth feeds . I study them in the attic of an old house my wife 's mother has in the Tyringham Valley , in the Berkshires . " Dr. Klots , who was presiding at the dinner , tapped his tumbler , and the speeches began . Epidemic IN BITTER-Conn wind swept into the city during the early hours of New Year 's Day , and shortly after eight o'clock in the morning , when we ventured down to the Department of Health , on Worth Street , to find nut how the emergency inoculation program against the Hong Kong flu was proceeding , there was scarcely a pedestrian in sight and the streets were deserted , except for an occasional car or bus , as far as the eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we made our way to the office of Dr. J. Warren Toff , Assistant Commissioner for Professional and Community Health Services , who was put ting through a series of telephone calls to check on vaccination schedules at the Department 's twenty-two District Health Centers . Dr. Toff is a heavyset , bespectacled man with a small black mustache and an affable manner , and when he finished his calls , a few minutes later , he told us that because of the " state of peril " declared by the Mayor and the Board of Health the city 's District Health Centers would all he open from nine to five to administer flu vaccine to elderly and chronically ill people . " In addition , we 've arranged for teams of doctors and public-health nurses to go around inoculating elderly patients in hotels , churches , golden-age clubs , and nursing homes , " he said . " The flu epidemic is at its peak right now . Some nine hundred thousand New Yorkers have been afflicted on the epidemiological up curve , and we estimate that six or seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curve runs its course , in the next month or so . A flu outbreak like this one has two stages . At first , the disease strikes mostly office workers , factory workers , and schoolchildren  --  people who tend to congregate in large numbers . Then it spreads to the rest of the population . The crucially important thing now is to inoculate as many people as possible in the high-risk category  --  people sixty-five and over , and people who have chronic diseases , especially heart or pulmonary conditions  --  in order to prevent deaths and excessive sickness during the down-curve phase . So far , fortunately , no flu outbreaks have been reported in any of the hundreds of nursing homes for the aged scattered through the city . But there 's no time to lose , and that is why we 're pushing hard with our emergency inoculadon program . " At this point , Dr. Toff was interrupted by a fierce blast of wind that howled against the side of the building and rattled the windows of his office . Then he went on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears in Asia , where flu is endemic , it is inevitable , because of normal East-West traffic and travel , that the virus will seed itself throughout the United States and spread to the rest of the world . " We were alerted to the probability of an epidemic of Hong Kong fin as early as last August , by the World Health Organization and also by the Communicable Diseases Control Center , in Atlanta , " he said . " Here in the city , we were able to start gathering our own intelligence data on the disease in September . Dr. Donald Con-well , Assistant Commissioner for Preventable and Chronic Diseases , always keeps a careful eye on the rate of absenteeism in the school system and in selected industries with large working populations , such as Con Edison . And Dr Morris Schaeffer , who is Director of Public Health Laboratories , maintains what amounts to a virus watch by examining prenatal- and premarital-blood-test samples for antibody titres . Whenever the titre count in random blood samples takes a sharp rise , we can be pretty sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when this coincides with a pronounced increase in the rate of absenteeism in our schools and industries , we can he reasonably certain of it . Then the problem becomes one of isolating the virus growing it in cultures and , if it turns out to be a new strain , arranging for various pharmaceutical houses to manufacture a vaccine that will provide immunization against it . Early in October , our indices told us that we were in for a siege of Hong Kong flu , and by the middle of the month Dr. Schaeffer and other doctors throughout the country had succeeded in isolating the virus . But to produce a vaccine in quantity  --  and , remember , all vaccines must be tested and pronounced safe and effective by the Division of Biologic Standards of the National Institutes of Health  --  takes at least ten weeks . For this reason , our first hatch of Hong Kong flu vaccine  --  eighty thousand doses  --  did n't arrive until December 17th . " Dr. Toff then informed us that forty thousand doses of that first batch of vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nursing homes for the aged , and to non-profit voluntary hospitals for in-patients in the high-risk category . " The other forty thousand doses were distributed to the District Health Centers , where we were soon immunizing an average of seven thousand ambulatory patients a clay , " he said . " Two days ago , when our vaccine supply was about to run out , we sent a police helicopter down to Merck , Sharp &; Dohme , in %Vest Point , Pennsylvania , to pick up twenty thousand additional doses . Yesterday , we " As nearly as we can figure , our troubles seem to have started when ' Sing Along with Mitch ' went of the air . " THE NEW YORKER received forty-four thousand more , and early next week we 're expecting another large shipment . We hope to have inoculated between one hundred and seventy-five thousand and two hundred thousand people out of the city 's total high-risk population of approximately a million by the middle of January . Since two hundred thousand others will probably have been immunized by private physicians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the end almost half the elderly and chronically ill people in the city will have received flu shots . The vaccine takes ten days to give protection and is estimated to be about seventy per cent effective , so we 're hoping for the best . " A few minutes later , following a suggestion made by Dr. Toff , we left the Department of Health , hailed a cab , and drove across the Manhattan Bridge to look up Dr. Samuel Minowitz , who is Health Director for the Borough of Brooklyn , at the Fort Greene District Health Center , on Flatbush Avenue Extension , near Dc Kalb Avenue . Dr. Minowitz was in his office . He told us that hr had worked long hours since the " state of peril " was declared , and we thought he looked tired . " Not very many people are coming in for shots this morning , because of the cold weather , but I expect things to pick up toward noon , " he said . " In the meantime , I 've dispatched two physicians and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people at the Willoughby Nursing Home . If you want to drop in there , I 'll call up the Home to get permission , and send you in the panel truck we use to shuttle vaccine to our other District Health Centers . " We thanked Dr. Minowitz for his offer , and ten minutes later , after a wind-buffeted ride through BedfordStuyvesant , we arrived at the Willoughby Nursing Home , in the Bush-wick section , where we found the four members of the medical team filling syringes from vials of vaccine at a small table that had been set up in the lobby . There was a strong smell of antiseptic in the lobby , which contained ? some lounge chairs , a candy machine , an upright piano , and a television set , and as we stood watching the medical team at work , the lobby began to fill with old people , nearly all of them in wheelchairs . Some of the old people were pushed by attendants , others propelled themselves , and most of them were silent . Then the two doctors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering words of encouragement , and injected them with vaccine . Lists of the names and ages of the patients on each floor of the nursing home had been drawn up , and as each person was inoculated his name was crossed off the appropriate list and he was wheeled to the other side of the lobby . The list for the first floor contained sixty-seven names . The oldest patient was ninety-seven , and most of the others were in their eighties . We returned to the Fort Greene District Health Center an hour later , and went down to the immunization clinic , in the basement , where two public-health nurses were preparing to inoculate a dozen elderly people who had recently arrived . Most of the people had tear-filled eyes from having ? come through the bitter cold , and they were lining up in front of a table that held rows of plastic syringes filled with vaccine . " You know , I 'm afraid , " an elderly Negro woman said as she rolled up her left sleeve . " We 're all afraid , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old woman 's arm with alcohol and inoculating her . " There . Now it 's all over and you were very brave . " " Happy New Year ! " said the next person in line , an incredibly wizened and wrinkled little woman who wore a white kerchief over her head and had a bright smile upon her face . " How old arc you , dear ? " the nurse asked . " I 'm eighty-three , " the little woman replied . After the elderly people had received their inoculations , the ) pulled on overcoats , hats , and scarves , and took an elevator up to the street level . Then they stood for a few moments inside the glass entrance doors of the Health Center , hesitating to brave the icy weather . At last , they went outside , and , bending into the cruel wind , made their way homeward .
