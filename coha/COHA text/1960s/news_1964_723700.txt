txt The unemployment rate declined in December to 5.5 per cent , the Labor Department reported today . The drop from a rate of 5.9 per cent in November was substantial . Experts in the Bureau of Labor Statistics cautioned , however , against attaching much significance to it . A good share of the drop , they said , was a correction from a large jump the month before . That increase was caused to a considerable extent by a quirk in the statistics used to adjust the rate to eliminate seasonal influences . Essentially , the experts said , today 's figures indicate a continuation of the job picture the bureau has been re- porting for months  --  unemployment stuck at a fairly high level , midway between 5 and Iper cent of the labor force . Last month 's rate was the same as the rate in October , and in December of the year be- ! fore . And it was close to the average for all of 1963 of 5. ( per cent . Unemployment declined by 90,000 in December to 3,816,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the year . The department said that the entire net decline was accounted for by those looking for partchange in unemployment , the Labor Department said that the number of jobless men rose by about 250,000 . This was in line with seasonal expectations as outdoor work was cut back . The jobless rate for men ? 4.4 per , cent in December ? was virtually unchanged . Unemployment b amon , * teenagers declined by about 140,000 over the month at a time when there is usually little change . The jobless rate for teen-agers ? a volatile figure ? dropped from 17.2 per cent in November to 14.8 per cent in December . This brought it back to about the average for the year . Fewer Women Jobless The decline in the number of unemployed women ? close to 200,000 ? was a little larger than the seasonal expectation . The rate declined . from 5.7 per cent in November to 5.2 per cent in December . The jobless rate among married men continued to creep slowly upward . It was 2.9 percent in September and October . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3.4 per cent in December . Department experts indicated that it was too soon to attach significance to this , but said that future developments would be worth watching . Total employment last month dropped by 700,000 to about 68,600,000 . This was in line with the seasonal expectation . The decline was entirely among farm workers . More significantly , the figures indicated that , after adjusting for seasonal factors , employment was still stuck at about the level it reached last July . After seasonal adjustments , the employment figure was 69 , - 206,000 in December . This is 1,115,000 above the total of December , 1962 . But 1,070,000 of the gain occurred between December , 1962 , and July , 1963 , and only 45,000 between July and last month . The total labor force declined in December by about 800,000 to 72,461,000 . This was the expected seasonal reduction . Over the year , the labor force grew by about 1,100,000 , This was a little below the department 's long-term projection for the labor force 's growth . Experts in the department think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over-all unemployment rate from 5.5 to 5.9 per cent between October and November resulted from a statistical quirk . And , thus , about half of the drop they reported today , they think , was a correction compensating for the large jump the month before . What happened was that in the mechanics of adjusting the November figure to eliminate seasonal factors , the change in unemployment between October and November , 1961 , was given great weight . But this change  --  an increase of 56,000 ? was not at all typical . In 1960 , the increase was 453,000 . In 1962 , it was 508,000 . Thus , because of the heavy weight ascribed to the figures of 1961 , not enough of the increase in unemployment of 483 , - 000 between October and November , 1983 , was ascribed to seasonal factors . Therefore , the unemployment rate , after seasonal adjustments , was higher than it should have been .
