Does the Johnson Administration genuinely want a peaceful settlement in Viet Nam ? The question has been asked and answered scores of times in the past year . Last week , as the U.S. 1st Air Cavalry Division battled North Vietnamese regulars in the fiercest , costliest fighting of the war ( see THE WORLD ) , the issue came up again-this time with an implication that the Administration had summarily rejected a so-called " peace feeler " from Hanoi last year . <P> When Government officials denied that any " meaningful " offer had been made or refused , pundits and editorial writers all but accused Administration officials of lying ; some went so far as to picture-from Washington-a nationwide " crisis of confidence " in President Johnson 's policies . <P> Deep Recall . As in most press-fueled controversies , the facts were largely obscured by the furor . Last week 's free-for-all started with an article in Look in which CBS Newsman Eric Sevareid described-as he had on TV last summer-a conversation that he had with Adlai Stevenson shortly before his death . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stevenson had talked of behind-the-scenes arrangements made by U.N . Secretary-General U Thant in the early fall of 1964 to have a North Vietnamese emissary and a U.S. delegate open talks in neutral Rangoon . <P> Stevenson is quoted as saying that " someone in Washington " had at first said such talks would have to wait until after the presidential election , but when U Thant tried again around the first of the year , Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara " flatly opposed the attempt . " U Thant was " furious , " and " there can be no doubt , " wrote Sevareid , " that Adlai Stevenson , who was working closely with U Thant in these attempts , was convinced that these opportunities should have been seized , whatever their ultimate result . " <P> Rusk 's Antenna . The essential facts of the story-minus Stevenson 's posthumous opinions-were reported when they were first leaked to the press by U Thant early this year . Nonetheless , no sooner had Sevareid 's piece appeared last week than reporters demanded more explicit details from the Administration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word of truth in the remarks made about me or the position attributed to me . " White House Press Secretary Bill Moyers declined even to discuss the story , explaining : " I follow the President 's advice of a long time ago , in not commenting on what dead men either said or might not have said . " <P> Finally , State Department Spokesman Robert McCloskey admitted that the U.S. had indeed rejected U Thant 's suggestions for a conference-through Secretary of State Dean Rusk , not McNamara . McCloskey 's unfortunately worded comment was that " we saw nothing to indicate that Hanoi was prepared for peace talks , and the Secretary of State said he would recognize it when it came . His antenna is sensitive . "
