Rear Admiral William L. Erdmann spent 36 years in the U.S. Navy building a reputation as a hard-nosed officer with a magnificent temper and a monumental self-confidence . From Coronado ( where the enlisted men 's beach was named Erdmann Beach ) to Guam ( where he stirred up a superb row by refusing to supply the Governor with side boys ) he was known as " The Big E. " + His strapping ( 6 ft. 4 in. , 230 lbs. ) frame never seemed to stop swelling with rage when he uncoiled from behind a desk to bawl out some wilting subordinate . But last week the spit-and-polish admiral ( Annapolis ' 24 ) was as subdued as a brand new swab jockey hauled up before his first Captain 's Mast . Erdmann had barely settled down in his Marin County , Calif. home to enjoy his retirement from the Navy when a federal grand jury indicted him for smuggling . The charge : Erdmann , when relieved as Commander of Naval Forces in the Marianas , had packed home 100 gallons of tax-free liquor aboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a bundle of tables , carvings , peacock chairs and fishnet floats . Said the admiral manfully : " The main point is I did it . I was caught , and I regret it very much . " <P> Revenue agents caught wind of the cargo from customs men , began to snoop around the admiral 's Marin County home . Armed with a search warrant , they raided a locked room behind the admiral 's bar , found 816 bottles ranging from rare old Scotch to rich liqueurs and Greek brandy . Erdmann had paid $760 for the entire supply ; Treasury agents said it was worth $4,400 retail . <P> Admiral Erdmann , said his lawyer , is prepared to pay the tax that is due on the whisky . He had never intended to sell the stuff anyway . It was all for his own personal use . Navy rumor had it that the case had been turned over to civilian authorities on the theory that punishment would be stiffer than that handed out by a Navy court martial . Many who had served with The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meanwhile , the irreverent U.S. Navy began to call Erdmann Beach by a new name : Smuggler 's Cove . <P> <P> + A nickname more appropriately used for the durable aircraft carrier Enterprise .
