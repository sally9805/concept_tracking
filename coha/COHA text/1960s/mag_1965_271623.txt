The Government team had been given a thankless assignment : explaining the U.S. presence in Viet Nam to college students and professors . <P> Members of the team at various times were Thomas F. Conlon , 40 , now head of the State Department 's Australia and New Zealand desk , but between 1960 and 1962 a Vietnamese-speaking official of the U.S. embassy 's political section in Saigon ; Earl J. Young , 34 , an AID representative in South Viet Nam between 1963 and last February ; Lieut . Colonels Thomas M. Wait , 40 , and Rolfe L. Hillman Ir. , 41 , both veteran U.S. Army advisers in South Viet Nam . <P> They had been to the State University of Iowa in Iowa City and to Drake University in Des Moines . At Iowa City , where the team met with 200 students and faculty in a campus building that once was the state Capitol , they were picketed , hooted and jeered at by the largely hostile audience . <P> Now the team arrived at the University of Wisconsin in Madison . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Support the People of South Viet Nam . Opposing their appearance was a Committee to End the War in Viet Nam . They were hailed by a declaration , signed by 132 faculty members and carried in a college newspaper , attacking the U.S. for creating in Viet Nam " a triple crisis-moral , domestic and practical . " <P> " Light , Not Heat . " At an informal preliminary session over coffee and cookies with professors and graduate students , the team got a taste of what it was in for . " You State Department people , " complained Fred Ciporen , 25 , a history graduate , " are coming here on the assumption that we students do n't know what Government policy is . Well we do know , and we disagree with it . " Replied Conlon : " No , we do n't make that assumption at all . We only intend to share our experience with you . We are interested in and respect your views and hope you will respect ours . " Retorted Ciporen : " Come on ! Why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're a bunch of babbling idiots . " Said Conlon quietly : " We want to shed light , not heat . " <P> That night , some 650 students and faculty members showed up for the full-dress question-and-answer period . Many of them carried placards saying such things as , THE WAR IN VIET NAM is <P> AN IMMORAL WAR , A DIRTY WAR , A <P> FUTILE WAR . About a third of the audience wore black armbands . <P> The Bullfight . The black-armbanders refused to sit down , stood hooting and hollering around the edges of the hall . The chairman of the meeting , Angela Mischke , 23 , a graduate in Russian history , pleaded in vain " Please sit down . " Cried Fred Ciporen : " These people are standing for a reason ! If you ask them to sit down , you 're missing the point . " Finally a semblance of order was achieved , and Conlon began by comparing the meeting to a bullfight where the crowd had just shouted " Let the bull come out ! " Asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nam , he said simply : " The overall aim of the U.S. Government is to assist a legal government , recognized by over 50 countries in the world , to resist aggression from North Viet Nam .
