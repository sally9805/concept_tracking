 | Hopes Go Up and Some Come Down Three days before last week 's Florida Derby at Gulfstream Park , Ohio sportsman John Galbreath picked up the telephone in his Miami house and called his contract jockey , Braulio Baeza , in New York . Word had reached him that Baeza , who had suffered two broken ribs in a fall at Aqueduct on March 22 , was ready to go back to work and that , barring further discomfort , the brilliant Darby Dan Farm rider ( page 45 ) might accept the mount on Abe 's Hope in the Florida Derby . Galbreath , who has a horse of his own named Graustark ( the Kentucky Derby favorite ) for Baeza to ride this seascn , was understandably worried . " For heaven 's sake , Braulio , " he pleaded into the phone , " I do n't want you taking any chances . Do n't ride any horses until you feel 100% recovered , and when you do ride again , watch what you 're doing . Above all , do n't get set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming up . " For Baeza , every $100,000 horse race is an important one ? whether he is riding for Galbreath , John Doe or , in fact , for Robert Byfield and Joe Bartell . These two frustrated owners of Abe 's Hope had watched their game colt lose a desperate stretch duel by a nose to Buckpasser in the nowfamous betless Flamingo a month ago . When the horse 's regular rider , apprentice Earlie Fires , was suspended last week , the colt 's polo-playing trainer , Del Carroll , summoned Baeza . And , sore ribs or no sore ribs , Braulio responded . Appearing for duty with nearly half of his slender torso tightly taped , the Panamanian rode brilliantly ? but , alas , carelessly . In a pulsating , frantic finish that converted a race between a bunch of secondary contenders for the Triple Crown into a thrilling contest ? one worthy of any Derby ? Baeza drove Abe 's Hope to victory by a neck over Williamston Kid , who , in turn , had barely a nose margin over Bold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came Sky Guy , a length in front of the favorite , Kauai King . It was a fine , tight finish ; but few of the 25,341 observers realized that for the last eighth of a mile the race had devolved into a meaningless roughhouse , with an assortment of leg-weary horses slamming into each other . Bold and Brave was on hand as deputy for Buckpasser , whose recent quartercrack will force him to miss the Kentucky Derby as well . Trainer Eddie Neloy knew he probably was not saddling a fully equipped first-string sub , and as he accepted condolences on behalf of Buckpasser he @#  | quipped , " This game is like golf . Every shot makes somebody happy . " Bold and Brave 's shot in the Florida Derby did not carry far enough . As expected , he took the lead under Bill Shoemaker , and led by as much as five lengths on the backstretch . But , turning for home , weariness overtook the son of Bold Ruler , and the chase was on . Shoemaker clung to the inside , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip through with Kauai King . On the outside of Shoe was Sky Guy , who had run a consistently steady race , while next to him , driving , was Abe 's Hope . On the outside of all of them , well clear of trouble , was the 90-to-1 shot Williamston Kid , under Robert Louis Stevenson . Leaving the eighth pole , Abe 's Hope ducked in and bumped sharply against Sky Guy , knocking him off stride . The five horses drove furiously on to the wire , but just before Abe 's Hope reached it he came in again , and again slammed against Sky Guy . As he did , Kauai King , who had fought his way into contention virtually on Bold and Brave 's flanks , bore out . The two colts , Abe 's Hope and Kauai King , put a perfect squeeze on Sky Guy and eliminated him completely from what surely would have been a second-place finish . While this hit-or-miss game was going on , the far outside horse , Williamston Kid , had an unimpeded run into second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the errors of others . Jim Combest on Sky Guy had no alternative but to claim foul against Baeza and Abe 's Hope , and the claim was upheld . This moved Williamston Kid into the winner 's circle ( for the first time since last October in Chicago , when he beat Abe 's Hope in the Juvenile at Hawthorne ) , and sent Bold and Brave from third to second . The offended Sky Guy went from fourth to third . Abe 's Hope came down to fourth . Baeza 's case would normally have come before the stewards on Monday and he could have expected a five-day suspension , beginning on the Tuesday . But Braulio has an important date with John Galbreath and Graustark at Keeneland this Saturday , so he went to the stewards and requested an immediate hearirrg . The stewards found him guilty and gave him his five days . Sore ribs , hurt feelings and the loss of $8,340 in purse money notwithstanding , Baeza will be in Darby Dan silks this Saturday , the day his suspension ends . John Galbreath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Florida race was supposed to bring the Kentucky Derby picture into clearer focus , something went drastically wrong . Abe 's Hope probably was the best horse , but he has still officially won only one of eight starts this year . And not too much can be said for any of the others . The time for the mile and an eighth was a very poor 1:50 3/5 . Yet , because of the close finish , there will be a bunch of happy owners strutting proudly about for the next month , clinging to the hope that in four weeks a mediocre racehorse can be transformed into a Kentucky Derby champion . Take the Williamston Kid faction , for example . The colt is co-owned by Trainer Jim Bartlett and Paul F. Ternes , president of Standard Steel Treating Co. in Detroit . They have had a 10-year partnership that has yielded a lot of fun but little profit . " Two years ago , " said Jim Bartlett after winning the Florida Derby , " 1 was talking on the phone to my breeder friend E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little luck with sons of Piet , and Thomas told me he had a Piet yearling . He said the price was $5,000 @# Should his filly , Moccasin , go against the boys in the Derby ? Bull Hancoc and if the colt was n't just like he d scribed him to me , all I had to do w send him back and the deal was off liked what I heard and bought him f. $5,000 sight unseen . " Co-owner Ternes smiled through this explanation and joined Bartlett in a happy cry of " On to the Kentucky Derby . " The Abe 's Hope people , after sues harrowing experiences in both the Flamingo and Florida Derby , might be excused if they never stabled in the Sunshine State again . But they are not giving up . Their colt , a son of Better Bee purchased in a four-horse package deal last August from Illinois Racing Commissioner William Miller , is as game as an . horse in training . What makes him worthy of Derby consideration is that he finishes well and appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who owns Kauai King , is not ready to turn his back on a Triple Crow r. challenge either . " We 'll take our colt to Bowie next , " he says , " and then to Kentucky . " While these people were pondering the futures of their colts ? and while the Phippses were trying to regroup a stable of 3-year-olds that once looked as unbeatable as the teams from Calumet of 10 and 20 years ago ? the real Derby intecasin. go against the boys in the Derby ? Bull Hancock waits to decide .  | terest was narrowing down to two old professionals , ready and waiting at Keeneland . In one corner was John Galbreath , his undefeated ( five for five ) Graustark recovered from a bruised heel and set for a six-furlong sharpener this Saturday . In the other corner was cagey Bull Hancock , owner of undefeated ( eight for eight ) Moccasin , champion 2-year-old filly of 1965 . Between the two of them Graustark and Moccasin could elevate the 92nd Kentucky Derby from a depressing scramble into an epic battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Galbreath on hand , Graustark had his final workout at Hialeah and was , according to his proud owner , " a joy to behold , running through the slop . " The next morning Trainer Lloyd Gentry fixed a tight skullcap on Graustark 's head , and the son of Ribot was walked up the ramp of an ancient Southern Airways Transport C-46 for the $3,000 , five-hour charter flight of 900 miles to Lexington . Galbreath clambered up the ramp after his prized possession , walked to the front of Graustark 's tight box stall and patted his handsome head . All ashore who plan to go ashore , " said the pilot . Galbreath took a last look at his horse and said , " He 's got a lot of sense and a very inquiring eye . " Later , when the subject of Hancock 's filly was brought up , Galbreath said matter-offactly , " I do n't think Bull will run her in the Derby when there are all those other opportunities . " Nobody knows whether Moccasin will run in the Kentucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical man , as well as a genius with horses . But he is also a Kentuckian , and Kentuckians know that there is only one Derby . Hancock 's Claiborne Farm , in Paris , Ky. , has been the most successful stud farm for many years . " We 've bred some awfully good mares , " says Bull . " Including Delta , Doubledogdare , Misty Morn , High Voltage and Vagrancy , just to name a few . In all honesty , I have to put Moccasin ahead of all of those , and also ahead of any mare I 've ever seen . " Last fall , after Moccasin 's victory in the Gardenia ( just before she bucked her shins and skipped The Garden State ) , Bull Hancock had a few things to say about fillies racing colts . " Except at the end of a season , when there is nothing ahead but a long rest , I 'm against it . No matter how great Moccasin may be next spring I would not point her for the Ken-@# tucky Derby . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colts , but in getting her ready for this tough race early in May we might easily be jeopardizing her future . She has a great series of filly races to aim at , and if she went in the Derby she might never be the same racemare again . In other words , I 'm against sending her against colts in May , but if she holds her current form 1 would definitely plan to see her against colts later in the season . " That was in November at Garden State . In January , at Hialeah , with the Derby only four months away , Hancock was having second thoughts : " I 'm a Kentuckian , you know , and I 'd rather win the Kentucky Derby than all the rest of the races in the world put together . So , if I really thought that Moccasin had the best chance to win the Derby , it 's possible that I might give her a shot at it . If she won it 1 would n't care if she never won another race in her career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hancock was still pondering the question last week . He knew that Buckpasser would be missing at Churchill Downs and that the two best colts in California this winter , Boldnesian and Saber Mountain , would also skip the trip to Louisville . He knew the results of every major 3-year-old race in America this year and had received reports on how every Derby candidate was training . Was he ready to decide ? " The key to what we 'll do with Moccasin is that we 'll watch Graustark , " said Hancock at his farm . " Everything tells me not to run . If Graustark comes up to the Derby like I think he will , we wo n't run . But if he stumbles along the way , we 're in a position to move . There is a rule of thumb , you know ? if a colt is able to work a mile in 1:40 by April 1 he 'll be able to run a mile and a quarter on the first Saturday in May . Well , our filly is ready to do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1:41% and all we can do now is keep on training her and watch the rest of them ? but especially Graustark . " As he prepares to wait out the month of April at Claiborne Farm , Bull Hancock is looking forward to Moccasin 's first start ( on the same card as Graustark but in a different race ) this Saturday at Keeneland . Bull remembers the fate of other fillies in the Kentucky Derby . Of 1,005 starters in 91 Derbies , only 29 have been fillies . Just one , Regret , won ? in 1915 . But all this form , past and present , may be thrown out when Hancock reminds himself , " 1 'm a Kentuckian. " 27
