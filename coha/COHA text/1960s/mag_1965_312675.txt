Alabama &; After <P> Sir : I read your cover story on civil rights March 19 with tears coursing . If only we Jews had had a Martin Luther King to arouse national and world conscience during the Hitler regime , how different our history might have been ! <P> RUTH S. FILLER <P> Auckland , N.Z. <P> Sir : I believe that the events of Selma bear brilliant testimony to the promise of America . Nowhere else is the attempt to resolve this problem being made with such equanimity , openness , and faith in human goodness in our system of government . I am confident that a further source of pride in America-a just and honorable solution-is forthcoming for all of us . <P> JAMES A. REGISTER <P> Providence , R.I. <P> Sir : Your recent reporting of civil rights events in Mississippi and Alabama was superb . Your remarkable example of responsible and dynamic journalism is pricking the conscience of America . <P> WILLIAM LARKIN <P> St. Joseph , Mich . <P> Sir : I am comfortable in my home with my husband , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to go to Alabama . But from the bottom of my heart I do want to thank all of the ministers , rabbis , nuns , college professors , students , and just good plain white folk who took their lives in their hands and went on my behalf . <P> ( P.S. And reporters . ) <P> ROCHELLE WHITEMAN <P> Milwaukee <P> Sir : When asked whether the nonviolent civil rights demonstrators were not on occasion guilty of defying the law even as members of the white Citizens Council defy it , Judge Thurgood Marshall replied ( roughly ) as follows : " When civil rights demonstrators break the law to protest against an unjust social order , they are willing to pay the price-to go to jail if necessary-in order to witness to what they believe in . I wonder if the members of the white Citizens Councils are willing to do the same ? " The tradition of civil disobedience in our country is an old one . When Henry Thoreau refused to pay taxes that were being used to finance a war that he regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited him , he said , " Henry , why are you here ? " And Thoreau replied , " Waldo , why are you not here ? " <P> MALCOLM L. DIAMOND <P> Princeton University <P> Princeton , N.J. <P> Sir : I find your largely negative comments about clergy participation in the demonstrations in Selma and Montgomery March 26 reasonably factual but unpardonably superficial . We went to Alabama chiefly in response to Martin Luther King 's call for help . Responding to desperate calls for help would seem to be appropriate clerical behavior . We went as an act of deliberate identification with those in need whose cause is just , to lend encouragement and support , and hopefully to redeem in part our past record of passivity and neutralism . We went as American citizens deploring and protesting Wallace 's disfiguration of American democracy . In Montgomery we discovered another reason for being present . Justice Department men encouraged us to join the march on the county courthouse on March 17 to help calm the demonstrators and to deter possible brutality from police and citizenry . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church <P> Roseville , Minn.
