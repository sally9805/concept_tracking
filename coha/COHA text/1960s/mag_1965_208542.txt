For sheer pyrotechnics and power , there had never been a rocket launch like it . From Complex 40 at Cape Kennedy last week , Air Force Titan IIIC , the heaviest and most powerful rocket system ever launched , blasted off in a mighty torrent of flame and smoke , and with a deafening roar soared out of sight . Though U.S. hopes to close the rocket gap with the Soviet Union rode on the new Titan , the competition this time was not so much international as it was between solid rocket fuels and liquids . <P> The launch was a solid success - a good , clean lift-off galvanized by 2.4 million Ibs. of thrust from twin solid-fuel boosters . The Titan IIIC resembled three huge bullet-nosed flashlights standing side by side . The 127-ft. center rocket was a souped-up version of the liquid-fueled Titan II that boosted Gemini astronauts on two successful shots . Strapped on to each side were two 85-ft. rockets , each one containing five 39-ton solid-fuel segments stacked one on top of the other . Within three-tenths of a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrust in unison , lifting the whole package clear of its umbilical tower in four seconds . After 108 sec. , with the Titan already 28 miles up , the reddish , rubberlike solid fuel burned out and the core rocket roared to life with 470,000 Ibs. of high-altitude thrust . This was the crucial moment , but the change from solids to liquids went off without a hitch . Then 12 minutes after ignition , the third-stage liquid-fuel rocket fired a 21,000-lb. dummy payload into orbit . <P> The Air Force is counting on the Titan IIIC to be its space workhorse , both for military and experimental purposes . In twelve more test firings , Titan III-Cs with varying configurations of solid engines will orbit payloads of scientific instruments , communications satellites , a satellite for the detection of nuclear explosions in outer space , as well as test runs of equipment for the Air Force 's proposed Manned Orbital Laboratory . Future solid boosters , claims United Technology Center , developer of the booster stage , could produce lift-off thrusts of 18 million Ibs . Proponents of solids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NASA to change its mind and incorporate strap-on solid boosters in its Saturn V , the rocket that is being designed to propel man to the moon .
