The worship-filled day of the Rev. Arthur Carl Kreinheder begins at 6 with the recitation of lauds . Afterward he celebrates Mass , and until the Great Silence that follows the night prayer of compline , his daily routine at St. Augustine 's House , near Oxford , Mich. , is marked by observance of the traditional hours of the divine office . It is a life much like that of any Benedictine priest in the Roman Catholic Church-but Father Kreinheder is not a Catholic . He is the first and only Lutheran monk in U.S. history . <P> Despite his Romish ways , Father Kreinheder , 57 , has a deeply rooted Lutheran faith ; his father was a Missouri Synod pastor , and his mother 's family founded a Lutheran congregation near Waynesboro , Va. , before the American Revolution . After serving as the skipper of a subchaser during World War II , Kreinheder increasingly felt a vocation to the church , but found the opportunities within U.S. Lutheranism too restricted . Then he read ( in TIME , Aug. 2 , 1948 ) about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One-Man Monastery . " I found what I had been looking for , " he recalls , " a place where a Lutheran could become a monk . " After briefly testing his vocation at Taiz , Kreinheder gave up his job as a merchandise manager for Detroit 's J. L. Hudson department store to study in Sweden for the ministry , and after his ordination in 1956 decided to try organizing a Taiz-style community in the U.S. <P> So far , Kreinheder has been more hermit than monk , since the three companions who helped him found his Congregation of the Servants of Christ soon gave up . His major support comes from the 300 Lutherans who belong to his Fellowship of St. Augustine , occasionally visit the monastery to make retreats and join him in prayer . Kreinheder has no pastorate , supports himself by raising sheep , gets advice and a helping hand in the fields from the sympathetic Catholic monks of nearby St. Benedict of Montefano Monastery . <P> Group Conversions . Kreinheder has a passionate interest in Christian unity . He is the U.S. secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Die Sammlung ( The Gathering ) , a German Lutheran group that prays and works for the union of their church with Rome . This ecumenicism keeps Kreinheder from joining the Roman Catholic Church , which many Lutherans think he might as well do . " Individual conversions are not going to be the answer to unity , " he says . ' ' When the move is made by a group , then we will have true unity , and that is what we are working toward . " <P> Luther himself was not opposed to monasteries , Kreinheder argues , and church tradition clearly authorizes marriage and celibacy as valid Christian vocations . Today , however , the Lutheran called to celibacy " has the choice of living his life out in solitude and loneliness as a bachelor , or becoming a Catholic or Anglican monk . " Kreinheder blames " my own inexperience and my own inadequacy " for St. Augustine 's slow start . " I do n't say that I 'm the perfect man to start this , but who else ? Someone has to begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
