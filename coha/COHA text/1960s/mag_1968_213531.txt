CZECHOSLOVAKIA ranked second only to Russia in its strict border control until early this year . Then , in one of its most welcome reforms , the Dubcek regime relaxed restrictions on travel , ' and Czechoslovaks began spilling joyously out of their country to explore the world . When Russian tanks moved on Prague on Aug. 21 , thousands of Czechoslovaks-including Deputy Premier Ota Sik and Foreign Minister Jifi Hajek-were relaxing on their first vacation abroad in years . For them , and for ordinary citizens who fled the country in the first clutch of fear , Russia 's continuing occupation poses an agonizing dilemma-especially as it has become clear that , unlike the refugees from Hungary in 1956 , they can go home again . <P> Thousands of them , including Sik and Hajek , chose to do exactly that , whatever the consequences . But many others were hesitating , as they watched and waited to see what the Soviets would do next . As of last week , some 50,000 Czechoslovaks , by their own government 's count , remained in the West . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept them as refugees officially , thus taking the first irrevocable step toward finding completely new lives . But the majority , by extending their tourist visas , by seeking student or work permits , or simply by staying put , are postponing a final decision . They are referred to by their host countries in such vague terms as " tourists on extended vacation " and " travelers living in self-imposed semi-exile .

A month after that , thousands of people disappeared " - into prisons . <P> <P> Little in Common . That has not yet happened in Czechoslovakia . Last week Party Boss Dubcek and his colleagues on the Presidium were still putting up resistance to Soviet demands for a list of Czechoslovaks whom the Russians consider " counter-revolutionaries . " <P> There were also new reports that Moscow was trying to unseat Dubcek ; the result was yet another delay in the planned conference between Czechoslovak and Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anguish , the Czechoslovaks separated from home and family by the invasion have little in common with the usual refugees from other Communist lands and crises . They are , by and large , skilled , well educated and often relatively well off . A son of Karel Ancerl , who has been named musical director of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra for its next three seasons , escaped across the border in his family 's Mercedes-Benz 250 SL . In Austria , many have loaded up their boxy Skodas for sightseeing tours of the Alps while they await developments in Prague . In London and Paris , large groups of students who had planned to return from vacations and summer jobs to their schools at home were vying furiously for scholarships to stay abroad for the fall term . " There are so many beautiful things to see here , " explained Milan , a bearded Czechoslovak architecture student in Paris who , like many other expatriates , prefers not to be fully identified . " I might as well take advantage of it . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
