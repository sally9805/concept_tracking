The brassy sound of the studio band cuts off , the lights go down , a spotlight flicks on , picks up the broad back of a big man wearing a black frock coat , striped pants , patent-leather boots and a six-string guitar . The figure swivels around and drawls , " Hello-I 'm Johnny Cash . " At that , the 3,006 people who have been smothering their enthusiasm back in the cavernous depths of the Grand Old Opry House break loose like a thunderstorm on a hot July day . For like the man said-it 's Johnny Cash . <P> No Flashy Stuff . After 15 years in show business , Johnny Cash is finally being discovered by network television . Starting this Saturday , he will host his own one-hour series on ABC-TV , The Johnny Cash Show . An easygoing show , taped before a live audience at the Opry House in Nashville , Tenn. , it has a guest list that is casually shot through with such names as Bob Dylan , Glen Campbell , Mason Williams , Roy Orbison , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no " Johnny Cash Dancers , " no fleshy production numbers . ( " I do n't go in a lot for that flashy stuff . " ) Nothing but a minimum of talk and then down to the substance of Johnny Cash and his show : singing songs . One regular singing session that Cash conceived and is particularly proud of : " Ride This Train , " a wandering medley of folk songs and film clips through times and places in American history . <P> It has been a steady climb to this peak for John R. Cash , 37 . A solid coun-try-and-western success since 1955 , he has occasionally crossed the boundaries and sold to the wider pop audience ( Ring of Fire , I 'll Walk the Line ) .

From a three-room shack in Kingsland , Ark. , the hard-pressed Cash family moved to Dyess , Ark. , in 1935 , when a New Deal colony opened up there . Like the other landless farmers who gathered in search of their American dream , they ended up with 20 acres , a house , barn , chicken coop , a mule , a cow and a plow . The work was hard , the income meager . But , insists Johnny , " I was never hungry a day in my life . Aw , sometimes at supper we had to fill up on turnip greens and sometimes at breakfast it was just fatback and biscuits-but that was plenty . " And the entertainment was strictly homemade , usually singing along to the crackling of a country station on a wooden radio . <P> After a four-year stint in the Air Force ( where he learned to play the guitar to combat boredom ) , he headed for Memphis , where he met two auto mechanics who were also pretty good musicians . With Luther Perkins and Marshall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tennessee Two " - and began the round of playing free-for-alls at church socials , schools , county fairs and charity bazaars . " Finally somebody got the bright idea of auditioning , " Cash recalls . The trio trooped off to Sun Records in Nashville and sang a little ditty of Johnny 's called Cry , Cry , Cry . Within a matter of weeks , it had climbed to the top of the charts .
