" At the Stock Exchange we come into firsthand contact with the range of knowledge-the economic literacy-of a broad cross-section of the American people . That knowledge , not to mince words , is often shockingly inadequate . " So said George Keith Funston , president of the New York Stock Exchange , addressing last week the National Association of Secondary School Principals in Portland , Ore . His explanation : " We do not teach economics . " <P> Funston pointed out that a decade ago , only 4% of the nation 's 10 million high-school students were ever expected to take economics , and that only one state , Oregon , required economics for a high-school diploma . Since then , " the number of students taking economics shows no discernible upward trend , " although in the same decade the number of Americans who own stock has nearly doubled from 6,500,000 to 12,500,000-owing , in no small part , to Funston 's own efforts to bring new investors into the stock market . <P> But Funston believes this economic know-nothingness is not an insoluble problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds , providing it is made " real and exciting . " What is needed , says Funston , is more required courses and more and better teachers . As an example of what can be done , Funston cited the twelfth-grade teacher in New York 's Nyack High School who collected 50 from each pupil to form an investment pool . Together the class conducted an enthusiastic search for the right company in which to invest their $18 , finally bought one share of American Zinc ( price last week : $15 ) , avidly followed the market fortunes of " their " company all year-learning something of taxes , tariffs and fiscal policy in the process . To top it off , American Zinc President Howard Young heard about the experiment , at year 's end visited the class himself to conduct an " annual meeting " and answer questions . Said Funston : " I hope the Nyack idea will spread from coast to coast . "
