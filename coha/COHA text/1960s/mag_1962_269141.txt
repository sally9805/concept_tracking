The choice before the Democrats of Texas seemed simple enough . In a runoff primary for Governor they could select John Connally , 45 , an avowed conservative . Or they could choose Don Yarborough , 36 , a Houston lawyer who is about as liberal as Texans get . But in its final days the fight got so nasty that the selection no longer seemed simple . <P> Winging from town to town in a Cessna , Yarborough assailed Connally as ' ' a confessed lobbyist for Eastern oil and gas monopolies , nursed in the smoke-filled room and weaned on the big lie technique . " One such " lie , " declared Yarborough , was Connally 's press-conference plea at the 1960 Democratic Convention for delegates to vote for Johnson because Jack Kennedy suffered from " a death-dealing disease . " Conflicting religious rumors about Connally were widespread : 1 ) he had quit as President Kennedy 's Navy Secretary because he is anti-Catholic ; 2 ) he is a Catholic himself . ( Connally is a lifelong Methodist . ) <P> Connally , traveling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texarkana to El Paso , insisting at nearly every stop that Yarborough was the candidate of the Americans for Democratic Action . In Texas , that is about as damaging as calling him a Communist . Some Connally supporters did , in fact , place an ad that posed this choice : " Connally Go Ahead Versus C.I.O. Red . " Neither did Connally 's backers discourage the notion that Don Yarborough is kin to Democratic Senator Ralph Yarborough , who has been linked to Billie Sol Estes . ( Don and Ralph are not related . ) <P> Apparently the less tarnished , Connally emerged the winner . His political mentor , Lyndon Johnson , thus tightened his grip on the Texas Democratic organization . In November Connally will learn just how much the fratricidal name calling has hurt him : he will face conservative Republican Jack Cox , 40 , a onetime Democrat who switched to the G.O.P. and is trying to persuade Texas to do the same .
