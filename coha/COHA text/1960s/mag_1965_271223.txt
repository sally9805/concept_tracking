The sounds of oncoming day filled Saigon 's Nguyen Cu Trinh Street . Across from the eight-story Metropole Hotel , the third largest American en listed men 's billet in the city , buses be gan lining up for the day 's run to the beaches of Vung Tau .

An American MP , automatic shotgun cradled in the crook of his arm , and a white-uniformed Vietnamese national policeman neared the end of their guard duty outside the Metropole .
