For all the power and perquisites of the U.S. presidency , some of the problems of ordinary citizens necessarily follow a man into the White House . Like living within one 's income , and keeping up the payments on the mortgage . <P> The latter can be troublesome , particularly when the President is Richard Nixon , for whom the White House is not entirely a home . He is , by his own testimony , a " saltwater man , " and in a relatively short span of time has picked up two seaside abodes in Florida , another in California , as well as retaining his leasehold on the old family manse in Whittier , Calif . While none of the four dwellings is perhaps fit for a king , the three recent acquisitions are certainly suitable to the style of a First Family , with all that that entails . How in the world does Nixon meet those monthly mortgage bills on a salary of only $200,000 a year ? <P> Slightly Surrealistic . Well , it helps to have been a Wall Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the San Clemente spread . The price for the estate of 21 acres , including the large , Spanish-style villa now known familiarly as White House West , was $1.4 million . The terms were $400,000 down and $100,000 per year , plus 7% interest per year on the initial outstanding debt of $1,000,000 . The sale called for the principal to be paid off within five years . Normally , such an undertaking would require prodigious amounts of cash : annual payments of $175,000 for five years and then a liquidating wallop payout of $500,000 . <P> Nixon , however , elected to purchase with his own capital only the five seaside acres of the estate and the house . This gives him only one-fifth of the property , and only one-fifth of the down payment and maintenance charges to cope with personally . His portion of the down payment was $80,000 , the principal is $20,000 annually and the interest is $15,000 per year . In addition , the President exercised an option to buy the remaining four-fifths of the surrounding grounds . This was done for him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles . The trustee pays for the remaining four-fifths with $1,000,000 that Nixon borrowed from the Cotton Estate , previous owners of the spread . Out of this money comes the necessary $320,000 down payment , as well as the $80,000 for the principal payment and $60,000 in interest per year . <P> This arrangement seems slightly surrealistic , but it is cheaper than most available mortgages would be . In effect , the President is paying off the additional land at today 's prices , holding it and gambling on a continuation of the upward trend in real estate prices in the San Clemente area . Within the five-year period , the President will sell all but his five acres and house . If his gamble pays off , he will retire the debt on the borrowed money and perhaps even make a profit . Just to whom the President will sell is not known . It could be a " compatible " buyer-perhaps Nixon 's wealthy , longtime friend " Bebe " Rebozo-or it could be the Nixon Foundation , which might build a presidential library and museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town of Whittier would like that honor .
