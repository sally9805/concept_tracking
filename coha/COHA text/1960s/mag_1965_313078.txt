Alabama 's Governor George Corley Wallace , who regards himself as the very prototype of the Southern statehouse segregationist , was bitterly attacked last week as a " liberalizer " and was defeated by that grand old Southern political device , the filibuster . <P> This upside-down political cake was baked by Wallace 's ambition to run as the conservative candidate for the presidency in 1968 . To further this aim , he decided , he would need a second term as Governor ( TIME , Oct. 8 ) . Summoning his usually docile legislature into special session , Wallace introduced a bill to repeal a 64-year-old clause in the state constitution that expressly bars the Governor from succeeding himself . <P> After a sharp fight , the lower house passed the amendment by 74 votes to 23 . However , in the state senate Wallace 's bill bogged down in a talkathon organized by supporters of former Governor John Patterson , the leading candidate to succeed Wallace next year . When they attempted to invoke cloture , Wallace 's men were shocked to find that they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority needed to silence the rebels . <P> Never Again . Confident of getting three more state senators-but not six - on his side , Wallace decided next to challenge the senate 's two-thirds majority rule . His supporters petitioned e Alabama Supreme Court to lower the bothersome requirement to three-fifths , or 21 votes . This maneuver was quickly repulsed by the court which last week ruled 6 to 1 against Wallace on the grounds that it would be " impertinent and lawfully unwarranted " for the judiciary to intervene . <P> Throughout the state , where the attitude toward the Governor has been one of adulation , there was a sharp change . " I voted for our Governor " Mrs. Raymond A. Busier wrote the Montgomery Advertiser , " but if I can be forgiven , I 'll never again . Wake up Alabamians , before you sell your birthright for a mess of pottage . " State Representative Kenneth Ingram protested in the Birmingham News that he had previously considered Wallace " a champion of conservatism , but now I find that he is advocating what appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> Alabama 's major newspapers , which have long been in the Governor 's pocket , now lambasted him editorially over the succession issue . " It 's not Wallace 's destiny to become President , " said the Montgomery Advertiser , usually the state 's most fulsome Wallace worshiper . " We 're against third-party futility " Wallace , who is against criticism , had his own way of dealing with the fractious press . The state government controls wholesale liquor distribution in Alabama and , by no coincidence , the six daily newspapers that have been opposing Wallace 's second-term bid lost their liquor-advertising contracts last week .
