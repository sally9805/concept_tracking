MR , FUTURE A Story by LEO ROSTEN I D I D not hear the door open behind me . I heard nothing , indeed , until a musical voice murmured , " You may terminate your reverie , Lieutenant . " I jumped . Leaning against the door , which he had closed noiselessly behind him , was a figure who might have stepped out of Dostoevsky : a tail man with a red beard , a shock of red hair , baby-blue eyes , a thin blade of a nose . On the left breast of his maroon hospital bathrobe a colonel 's eagle was pinned . He looked about fifty-five . " Sharp now , lad . Sharp ! " He waved a swagger stick and seated himself with a flourish that swirled the bathrobe around himself tightly , poking the stick into one of the folds to carry it across the arm of the chair . " You may be seated . " Those blue eyes  --  very bright , mocking , vaguely maniacal  --  gleamed with piercing clarity . " Proceed to interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admission into your woebegone ward . Close yourmouth , Lieutenant ! I am quite aware that you can breathe . You resemble an idiot . " I opened a drawer nervously and rummaged around for an admission form , stalling for time , saying , " Quite a rain we 're having , Colonel . " His eyebrows formed inverted " V " s . " Colonel ? Colonel ? 1 see no colonel in this dreary chamber . What evidence warrants your absurd attribution of rank ? " " The eagle , sir , " I said in astonishment . " On your robe . " " Correction ! " he barked . " There is on eagle on n bathrobe . " " Oh . Is n't it your eagle ? " " No . " " Nor your bathrobe ? " " No ! " I cleared my throat . " Sir , would you mind telling me ? " " Delighted !

Millions had already contaminated our ranks . Well , I did my duty , that I did . No man can aver that Mr. Future did not his duty do . " " Is that your  --  name . Colonel ? " He jerked his head from side to side owlishly . " You are clearly hallucinating . " He pointed that blade of a nose at the ceiling and shook with glee . " Bravo , Mr. Future , bravo ! " I found myself hoping that someone would enter the room . I starred to excuse myself , to step across the hall , but remembered that Captain Newman and Stacy Mathieson were at Lubbock Field for a two-day conference . Captain Jarvis would be starting on morning rounds . My hand wandered to the phone . The man with the red beard leaned forward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no need to seek reinforcement . Fear not ; I am unhomicidal . " I remembered something Captain Newman had said a long time ago : " Never show you are afraid of a patient . Even a violent one . Your fear is more dangerous than his hostility . He wants the reassurance that you are not frightened by that in himself which frightens himself and threatens to overwhelm him . " I arranged the admission form in front of me . " May I ask how you got here ? " I tried to sound brisk . " You may ask ; I may not answer . Remove the ambiguity , sir . " " Who  --  sent you here ? " " A malignant M.D. upstairs , one Captain Robling . He is perbophoric . " " I beg your pardon . " He winked slyly . " You do not understand the word ? " " No , sir . " " Neither did that idiot Rohling . He would not know how to track a hippopotamus through the snow ! " " Did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me ? " The desk shook under the blow of his fist . " It is I , sir , who give permission . I informed Dr. Rhubarb of my destination , Get on with your questions ; man . " I poised my pen . " Name , please . " " Mr. Future . " I cleared my throat . " First name ? " " Objection ! immaterial and irrelevant . Put down any name you wish . Yes . Any-name Future . Next . " " Date of birth ? " He leaned Forward . " The day he left . " " Who 's he ? " " A friend , " he whispered , " a very close anti special friend . Mr. Past . Would you like to know about him , where he went , why he will never return ? " I leaned back in my chair . " All right . " " Ah . . . You restore yourself in my good graces . Mr. Past is gone , sir , far from these primitive , puerile purlieus . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where is Mr. Past ? I gave him my word , as an officer and a gentleman , never to reveal his whereabouts . Lips sealed . Ozymandias . " He winked again . " Ergo . Your hospital has me , Mr. Future , about whom they know nothing ; but in their files rests a dossier on Mr. Past , who is nowhere to be found . One patient with no case history ; one case history , but no patient . What a paradox ! What a triumph ! . .. At this point you should inquire about my age . " " How old are you ? " " How gullible you are . ? . . Why must I be surrounded by dolts  --  dupes , drones , depressive dumbbells ? I am excellent on ' d 's today . Decidedly . There 's another . " He put both hands out in supplication . " Do not be deceived by my facade . I have been diagnosed as psychotic : paranoid-schizophrenic . I do not mind . I do not agree , mind you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychiatric jargon . / put it to you simply : I am sick , sir . Sick of the Army to which I gave my life and my brilliance ; sick of this panatropical pesthole ; sick of being questioned , probed , doused , spied on ; sick of the disgusting charlatans who masquerade as physicians  --  at least two of diem upstairs are latent homosexuals ; be on guard , lad , on guard . I am also sick of you ! " He reached across the desk , picked up the admission form , tore the page down the Leo Rosten , the creator of " 11 ' Y* IV ? A* N K " A*13 ' 1* A* N " and many short stories , movies , and melodramas , as well as social studies of Hollywood and the religions of America  --  among other topics  --  will have his new novel , " Captain Newman , M.D. " published by Harper in October .

FUTURE center , turned the parts , tore them across and , rising , holding his arm high above his head , let the fragments flutter down from his hand in a paper snowfall . " Now , sir , you have my permission to escort me to Ward Seven . " " But I ca n't  --  Captain Jarvis will have to authorize it . " " He will , " whispered Mr. Future , " he will . Swiftly , swiftly , for I feel the fearful furies closing in . " He drew himself up to his full height and lifted the swagger stick , signaling me to him . Even in that drab and shapeless robe , he looked majestic . C AP TAIN JAR VIS , after a sardonic lecture from Mr. Future on dementia praecox ( " which , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , assigned Mr. Future to Room E. The case history I got from the files of Main identified Mr. Future as Colonel Norval Algate Bliss . A professional soldier for almost thirty years , he had completed tours of duty in the Philippines , the Canal Zone , Guam . After Pearl Harbor , he had been an Fourth Interceptor He flew to Australia spring of 1943 . In Port Moresby , New Guinea , his aide found him in his quarters one morning , entirely nude , cursing and ripping the sheets to shreds . In the base hospital , said the psychiatrist 's report , he developed a peculiar facial tic and " onomatomania , " dwelling on certain words compulsively , as if they were endowed with magical powers . He often invented words , words entirely without meaning . During a hurricane he had become homicidal , almost choking an attendant to death . He was put in a straitjacket . " E.S.T. " was initialed under " Treatment . " After six sessions of electroshock in a general hospital , he was shipped back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Lubbock he made me repeat every word I could remember from that extraordinary first interview with Mr. Future . lie did not seem impressed by the bizarreries which had made so vivid an impression on me . He asked me whether Mr. Future had referred to himself in the first person or the third person , if he had perspired much , if he showed spasmodic tremors . " Did he identify the two doctors upstairs  --  the ones he called queer ? " " No . He did n't , by the way , say they were queer ; he called them latent homosexuals . ' " Captain Newman frowned . He entered Room E. Mr. Future was propped up in bed , the sheet drawn up under his beard , a hook in his hands . " I granted no appointment for this hour ! " " I 'm Captain Newman . " The book lowered in Mr. Future 's hands . " Ahhh . . . the perceptive one of whom I hear the baboons babble brightly . At last . Come in , sir , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the antiseptic aroma and the dreariness of the decor . Neither , of course , did I choose .. . . " His crystal eyes were dancing . " Making observations on the patient , eh , Captain ? You should learn to control your expressions . I await your first question . " " How do you feel ? " asked Newman . Mr. Future winced . " Tsk , tsk ! Standard opening . You disappoint me . Have you no imagina-tion ? " " I 'm holding it in reserve . You 've got enough for both of us . " " Clever , clever . . . Consider : First , you bestow a compliment on the patient , to establish rapport ; then you attempt a tacit alliance  --  with that oh-so-innocuous both of us . ' A lesser man than I would walk into your trap . " He indicated the wicker chair . " Do sit down , Captain Boo-man , do sit down . " " Thank you , Colonel , " said Newman wryly . " Colonel ? Colonel ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you prefer I call you ? " " It is a matter of fact , not preference ! " he glared . " The name is Future , not Colonel . " " And mine is not Boo-man . " " Excellent , Captain , excellent ! I underestimated you . But you are beset and beleaguered by blockheads  --  brainless , benighted blockheads . I am in a mood that bursts with ' b 's this morn-ing . " " Brilliant ! " Captain Newman got his cigarettes and held the package out . Mr. Future 's eyes gleamed as he murmured , " Are you mad , sir ? " " Not at the moment . " " Offering a cigarette  --  in a psychiatric ward ? Matches , sir ! Damnably dangerous in the hands of demented men . " Newman nodded . " I was going to light it for you . " " You were not going to let me hold the matches ? " " Certainly not . " " Bravo ! 1 commend your candor . I believe I shall like you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a likable type . " Mr. Future grinned . " I believe we shall understand one another . " " You 'll understand me , all right , " said Newman . " I 'm not so sure that you want me to understand you . " " Then we understand each other already ! " The head went back ; a laugh boomed our ; the red beard shook . " Capital , sir ! You are shrewd in appraising my resistance , and canny in trying to effect a transference . My insight takes you by surprise , eh ? You must learn to control your expressions . I happen to be a student of psychiatry , sir . By necessity , not inclination . It is child 's play for me to use your silly mumbo-jumbo . Oh , what a pity Mr. Past is not here ! He would be amused by you and enchanted with me . Enchanted , sir , beguiled . No , I am tired of ' b 's ; they contain ' boring ' and ' banal . ' " C APTAIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty minutes before my next patient . You can use it up trying to show me how skillfully you play with words , how cleverly you produce verbal smoke screens  --  and waste my time and yours ; or you can lower your guard a couple of notches and tell me a few things which might  --  just possibly  --  help me alleviate some of your misery . " " Misery , sir ? Mr. Future ? Bah ! You are considerably more miserable than I ! " Newman shook his head . " I 'm only impatient . You ? " " Yes ? Go on , go on . " Mr. Future leaned forward eagerly . " Nothing . " " You must be fair , sir ! You are deliberately inciting rne . It is I who am impatient , not you . What were you going to say ? I have certain rights ; I insist upon them . Complete your thought ! " " You , " said Captain Newman , " are afraid . " Hate flared up in the blue eyes ; then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bless my soul , 0 penetrating pharmacist of the psyche : of what ? " " Of what you may reveal . " " Careful ! " Mr. Future whispered . Captain Newman groaned . " Ca n't you stop being clever ? This is n't a fencing match . We 're not trying to score points , or win ? " " But you are ! " cried Mr. Future . " You are trying to win . " " What ? " " My confidence ! " The head Shot back ; the whole body shook with glee . " Hooray . Hooray for Mr. Future , " said Newman . " How cunning he is . If it 's flattery you want , here 's a bushelful . You are an extremely intelligent man . You have an excellent brain and a remarkable sense of words . Now  --  can we go cm from there ? " Mr. Future was beaming , nodding , chuckling into his beard , stroking his mustache in vast self-satisfaction . Captain Newman sighed . " But what a pity that such intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trivial gestures . For what ? To impress an Air Force psychiatrist you hardly know , in an obscure Army hospital ? " " You flatter yourself ! " laughed Mr. Future . " I am not trying to impress you ! " " No ? Then you must be trying to impress him . " Mr. Future smiled slyly . Newman shrugged . " How strange . " " Eh ? Why ? " " Why should one have to try so hard to impress one 's dearest friend , the one who really understands you ? " Mr. Future 's features went dark . " Do not meddle , sir ! You will never understand certain things ! " " I think I understand : but I do n't agree . " " That which exists between Mr. Past and Mr. Future is sacred ! You want to destroy it ! " " Change it , " said Newman . Mr. Future licked his lips . " How ? " " I want to put Mr. Past where he belongs , in the past . And all your ingenuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're so miserable , Mr. Future , so very miserable . Running , twisting , turning , fleeing  --  from what ? You , and Mr. Past , you 're both men , are n't you ? You 've constructed it than way . So you can live , in secret , with another man ? " " Goddam your eyes ! " Mr. Future shouted . " God shrivel your heart and consume your monstrous brain . You are vile , vile , vicious and contemptible . I scorn your solicitude ! " Captain Newman nodded . " Most people talk in order to express themselves . But you ? " He stopped . " Continue , " said Mr. Future . " Go on . How do I talk ? " " You , " said Captain Newman , " talk to conceal yourself . " Mr. Future 's eyes burned . He spat on the floor . " Nor will you penetrate the place where Mr. Past hides . Never ! " " Maybe you 're right . " Newman tapped a cigarette on the back of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in bed followed the flame as it came up to light the cigarette . " One day , " Mr. Future whispered , " I will show you what I can do with fire . Ectomorphic ectonesia . The triumph of spirit over matter You were asking me to describe Mr. Past . " " I was not , " said Newman . " How direct you are . " You want me to ask you . " " Excellent . Captain ! You are not one to be ambushed . " Mr. Future grinned . " Ask me . " Newman shrugged . " Would you care to de-scribe Mr. Past ? " " I care very much . But to care is not to comply . " " Can you describe him ? " " I can , but shall not . . . . Do not be dis-couraged . " " How old is he ? " " That 's better . He is as old as Mr. Future . " " How tall ? " " As tan , too . " " What does he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does he have a profession ? " " He does not practice what he professes , " Mr. Future chortled . " It 's your time you 're wasting . " " It is not wasted . 1 wish to frustrate you . " " Congratulations . I am now frustrated . " You delight me . " Captain Newman pointed to his watch . " Twenty-two minutes left . Use them or fritter them away . " " You are at my disposal , " smiled Mr. Future . " But not at your mercy . " " Oh , fudge . Return to Mr. Past . " " Does he wear a beard , too ? " " No ! Are you not perceptive , sir ? Beards bespeak bravado , and bravado is beneath  --  hut you have bedeviled me back to the h 's , blast you , and soon I shall be angry with you . " " You already are . " Captain Newman stubbed the cigarette out on his heel and got up , " Well .. . " " Wait ! I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . But I did n't come here for the purpose of providing a patronizing patient with a plethora of pleasure . " Mr. Future laughed uproariously . " How shrewd of you . Seven ' p 's ! Yes , you are swift and see through many disguises ; but I am swifter . I make the case insoluble , sir ; confess it ! For Mr. Future has no past and Mr. Past has no future ! " He threw his head back and roared , " Ho , ho , ho , sir , ho , ho , ho ! Ha , ha , ha , sir , ha , ha , ha ! I shall answer but one more question . " " I have nothing more to ask you today . " Captain Newman started for the door . " But you must ! " cried Mr. Future . " Wait ! That is not fair ! I still have twenty minutes ! " " I 'll see you tomorrow . " Mr. Future leaped out of bed . " Goddam you ! " He hurled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay ! " He raised his fists over Newman 's head . " Go back ! Sit down before I ? " " Behave yourself ! " said Newman sharply . " You wo n't do that , Mr. Future . You do n't want to be put in restraint , do you ? And I do n't want to commit you , not vet . I 'm a friend of Mr. Past 's , too . . . Now , put your arms down . Go back to bed . Tomorrow , we 'll talk . . . . " Mr. Future lowered his arms slowly , blinking , chastened and bewildered . " Oh , dear . Oh , dear ... " Then he glanced at Captain Newman covertly , winking . " That orderly , Lawrence . Do transfer him , sir , lest I be compelled to strangle him with my bare hands . " W H E N Captain Newman finished his rounds the next day , he studied Mr. Future 's chart for a hang time . Mr. Future had refused to swallow any pills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had sat up in bed , in the dark , all night long , carrying on an animated conversation with Mr. Past . Newman entered Room E. Mr. Future was sprawled out on the bed , wearing his khaki shirt and tie and the pants of his pajamas . " Bonjour , Capitaine , " he called brightly . " Also Guten Tag , Buon giorno , and God rnorgen , which is Swedish . I speak four languages fluently . Well , no matter ; the correlation between languages and intelligence is negative . Any idiot can learn Chinese  --  if he is a Chinaman . Wo n't you be seated ? " " Merei . " Mr. Future laughed . " You delight me . Oh , I do hope you survive . " " Survive what ? " " Me . " Captain Newman smiled . " I suppose you know that you are somewhat paranoid ? " " Oh , yes . " " Do you know what that means ? " " Bah ! Your patron saint , Sigismundus Freud , has taught you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a homosexual base . " " Do you agree ? " Mr. Future regarded him slyly . " The dismal doctor was projecting , was he not ? All seems jaundiced to the jaundiced eye . " " I see that you wo n't take any of the pills I prescribed . " " I do not need to sleep ! I have surmounted Ihe call to oblivion . " Again , as on the preceding day , Captain Newman offered him a cigarette and this time , his eves gleaming . Mr. Future took it . Captain Newman struck a match . Mr. Furore lighted his cigarette , then gently removed the match from Newman 's hand . He did not blow out the match . He did not even look at it . The flame began to burn his fingers , but Mr. Future made not the slightest response or grimace or movement . The two men eyed each other in silence . The smell of burning flesh made Mr. Future cock his head to one side with an expression of amusement . Captain Newman pointed to the match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the match out and removed it from between Mr. Future 's fingers . " What am I supposed to do now ? Hail you as prophet ? Start a new religion ? " " Bah ! You do not grasp the point of my demonstration . " " You showed me the triumph of mind over matter . " " And you think me mad . Do you not ? " " Weil , you certainly act mad , " Newman sighed . " And am I not ? " " What do you think ? " Mr. Future punched his pillow in exasperation . " A cheap device ! You evade the point . I asked what you think , sir . Am I not entitled to direct response ? Is Mr. Future mad or is he not mad ? " " Mr. Future , " said Newman , " is an invention . " Mr. Future smiled . " Is he incurable ? " " I 'm trying to decide . " The red beard waggled . " At least you are honest . Not like the others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ? " " The doctors . " " Oh , come now . Doctors do n't go around persecuting patients . " Mr. Future grinned . " Your equanimity does not deceive me , sir . You are simply maintaining professional detachment . Oh , you do it well , that 1 grant you . Yet someone is persecuting me ! " " I agree . " The eyes filled with astonishment . " Yes ? Then you see it ? Who ? " Mr. Future whispered , " Who is persecuting me ? " " You . " " No ! " " Part of you is persecuting the rest . " " No . Oh , no . " Suddenly tears welled into the pale blue eyes . " Oh , if Mr. Past were only here . If you could but know him . " " But he is here , " said Captain Newman . " Where ? Look  --  search  --  examine every nook and cranny of these ghastly quarters ! Where can anyone find Mr. Past ? " Newman pointed at Mr. Future without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Future shouted . " Mr. Past is gone  --  far from here . I sent him away . " " Not entirely . You can use the past , learn from it , build on it . You can reshape it , even surmount it . But you ca n't abolish it , not even you ; and even with the most powerful will in the world , you ca n't will it away . " " Mr. Future can , " whispered the man with the red beard . " Mr. Future did . " " And is this where you wanted to end ? In a mental ward ? " " It was not I who consigned Mr , Future here ! " " This is where men end who split themselves in two . " Mr. Future was silent for a moment , lost , for the first time since he had come to Ward 7 , in sadness . " Shall I tell you a story , Captain ? It was years ago . I was on extended leave , in mufti , which permitted me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was walking through a long tunnel in Central Park , one cold winter day , and as I emerged , the sun struck my hair , my beard , A little lad , perhaps five , perhaps six , saw me , astonished , open-mouthed , his eyes like china saucers , ' Santa Claus ! ' he cried . ' Are you Santa Claus ? Are you ? ' I hesitated not one moment , sir , and bowed : ' That , son , is who I am . ' The lad caught his breath : ' Rut you are so tall ; you are so big and tall . How will you ever come down my tiny chimney ? ' The question gave me but slight pause . ' Watch , ' I said , and lighted a cigarette and blew out a cloud of smoke . ' This smoke , so , is like the smoke in your chimney , Watch . ' I puffed and puffed and blew out smoke . ' See ? The smoke gets larger and larger , but the cigarette gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , on Christmas Eve . Part of me turns into smoke , so I can come down your chimney . ' .. . Then I heard someone cry our  --  and she came along . Slut . Nurse . Slut . Like all the rest . She clutched that little golden lad , and tore him away , jabbering , ' Naughty ! Bad , bad boy . Talking to that filthy , crazy manl ' Mr. Future 's head dropped to one side , and though he made no sound , no sound at all , the tears gushed down his cheeks . R EACH him ? How the hell can I ? How does anyone ' reach ' a psychotic ? " Captain Newman looked tired that staff meeting ; his voice had that irascible edge I had come to recognize , the edge of discontent  --  with a colleague , a patient , above all , with himself . " What about trying Pentothal ? " asked Captain Jarvis . " Pentothal breaks down the defenses . And that 's the one thing Mr. Future does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got  --  and more . He 's afraid to lower his defenses , even for a moment . Why else his inability to tolerate silence ? Why his fantastic barrage of words , his obsession with letters , alliteration , puns ? He has to obliterate an internal threat , drown it in symbols , suffocate it with words . He has to escape from the terrible temptation to perversity by compulsive preoccupations  --  with verbal games , puzzles , rituals . He 's afraid to listen . He 's afraid to relax . He 's afraid to reverie , to sleep , even to be quiet . To be quiet is to he passive , too . To be passive spells danger ; in his mind , it invites attack . Remember his rage about Private Lawrence . . . . " One day Captain Newman asked me to come to Room E with him . Mr. Future was standing before the window , staring out . His back to us , he exclaimed , without turning : " Haltl It is useless to try to catch me unawares . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you : Captain Know-it-all and Lieutenant Bewildered . / have made a lifelong study of footsteps . " He threw his head back , turned to face us , and laughed . " Gentlemen , your questifications . Bequest them , I beseech you . I always burst with b 's , before breakfast . " Captain Newman did an odd thing . He sank into the wicker chair and gazed at Mr. Future steadily , saying not a word . Mr. Future cocked his head to one side . Newman did not move . Mr. Future frowned . The moments passed . Mr. Future shot me a glare of suspicion , then glanced back to Newman . He had not stirred . I think he wanted to see what Mr. Future would do if offered no comment , no cue , no foil , no words to turn against their user , no distractions to seize upon as respite from an insupportable self . As the silence spun itself out , I saw a bead of sweat From on Mr. Future 's brow ; he put on a smile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itwas an effort ; his eyes were anxious . Suddenly a sly , sidelong expression formed on his features ; recognition tried to allay anxiety as the self mobilized itself against betrayal . " Careful . Captain , " he murmured . Newman did not stir . Mr. Future shouted , " You think you 're smart because you make the rules , do n't you ? It 's you who 's mad . You ! " He towered over Newman 's chair and his hand slashed through the air as if wielding an axe , a few inches from Newman 's head , He began to sob , like a child in a temper tantrum , then sank to the bed and buried his face in his hands . " You bastard , " he cried hoarsely . " You dirty , scheming , clever bastard . " At last Newman said , " How do you feel now ? " " You know how 1 feel . You wo n't meet Mr. Past this way . Never . " He glanced up . " You know , I presume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sea of burning muck before they rescued him . " " When was that ? " " After a certain troopship was torpedoed . I will also tell you this : He can do anything Jesus did . " " Can you ? " " You mean , ' Can he ? ' " rasped Mr. Future . " No , Mr. Future , I mean ' you . ' " Mr. Future grinned . " I , sir ? Why , at this very moment am not I , like our blessed Saviour , being crucified  --  between two thieves ? " T H I S is a copy of the report Captain Newman submitted that afternoon : TO : Lt.

Colonel Pyser , presiding , tapped his gavel on its wooden base . " This board is now in session . . . Colonel Bliss , will you please state your name , rank and serial number ?

" He raised his hands in a travesty of supplication . " More need not be said . Duty has been done . " " You think these officers are persecuting you ? " asked Newman . " Of course . " " Why ? " " Because I am intelligent and they are ignorant . Because I know what they fear and do not fear what they know . " " Is anyone else persecuting you , Mr. Future ? " " All the **27;1698;TOOLONG  --  excluding you . You merely wish to trap me . " " Do you suffer from any diseases you know of ? " " I suffer fools and frauds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any pains ? " " Only in the ears  --  from the prattle of idiots . " " How do you sleep ? " " Miserably . " At this point , Colonel Pyser , who had been listening with amazement and discomfort , suddenly leaped forward , glad , I suppose , to intervene . " You say that you sleep miserably ? Why ? " " How would you sleep , Colonel Numbskull , in a room full of howling maniacs ? " Colonel Pvser 's cheeks went livid . " You will refrain from ? " " I will quote you Samuel Johnson ! " Pyser 's gavel came down sharply . " You will respect the dignity of this board ? " " I will quote the learned doctor ! " shouted Mr. Future . " ' Boy , let us be grave : here comes a fool !

" " They shall not rob the worthy , nor act Ahab to the whale ! " He winked to Captain Newman . " Paranoia , eh ? Let them contend with that ! " Colonel Pyser signaled the MPs and strode out of the room . Mr. Future shouted scornfully after him . But all he said to the MPs who led him out was : " Lads , do not quote scripture to the heathen , for he will eat you alive . " woman 's voice dence . " " May I speak to Mrs. Cluett , please ? " " And who may I say is calling , please ? " " My name is Captain Newman . I 'm calling from the hospital at Colfax Army Air Force Base . " " Oh ? ... One moment , please . I 'll see whether Mrs. Cluett is in . " A moment later the same unmistakable voice said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cluett , I 'm sorry to bother you , but I do n't know whom else to call . It 's about Colonel Bliss . " " Who , please ? " " Colonel Norval Bliss . Your name is given in case of emergency , and ? " " Norry ? Norry Bliss  --  gave my name ? Are you sure ? " The mellow voice quickened , almost girlishly . " Oh , yes . I 've got his file in front of me , " " How strange . Did you say you were calling from a hospital ? " " Yes . Colonel Bliss is my patient . " " Are you a doctor ? " " Yes . Mrs. Cluett , are you related to Colonel Bliss in any way ? " There was a moment 's silence , so dead that the connection seemed to have been broken . " Hello . . . Mrs. Cluett . . . are you there ? " " Yes . I 'm here . " " I was asking if you ? " " I heard you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way related . We were married , many years ago . It was annulled . " " Oh . I called because I hoped someone , perhaps you , might come here , to the hospital , I mean , to see him . " " What is wrong with him ? " Captain Newman said carefully , " He 's in a psychiatric ward , Mrs. Cluett . He 's going to be committed ? " " A mental ward ? Norry ? " The charming , husky voice rippled . " Oh , that is rich , really . That 's too good to be true . " " What did you say ? " " You heard me , Captain . I said he belongs in a lunatic asylum , and I hope he stays there ! I hope you never let him out ! I hope he goes through the same torture he put me through ? " " Mrs. Cluett ? " " Do n't Mrs. Cluett ' me , Captain whoever you arc .

Is that it ? " " Good-by ? " " Do n't hang up . I want to know your name ! " " Josiah , " he said impatiently . " Wli a ? ? " Joe , " " Joe ? Joe Newman ? And you want me to rush out to a hospital and hold poor Norry 's filthy hand ? " " Not any more , Mrs. Cluett ? " " I 'll tell you what you can do . Just go out and dig a grave and throw Norry in , and save the taxpayers all the money you Jews and Democrats are wasting in Roosevelt 's lousy war ? " Captain Newman put the phone down . His hand was shaking . T H E day before they were to put Mr. Future on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , Captain Newman went to Room F. Mr. Future was seated in the wicker chair , facing the window , his arms folded rigidly , staring out at the cottonwood trees and the parade ground . It was a dank , oppressive day , the sky gray and leaden , and all the flags hung limp and spiritless . Mr. Future made no sound as Newman entered , no movement when Newman came beside him . The blue eyes were fixed , hard and cold , with no light in them . " This may be the last time I 'll see you , " said Captain Newman . Mr. Future might have been a statue . " You understand , do n't you , that they 're going to take you to a veterans ' hospital now ? " Silence . Captain Newman sat clown on the bed . " I 'm sorry , Mr. Flame , Um sorry as hell I could n't help you . . . . Maybe I was n't the right doctor for you . Maybe I did n't really understand . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . I just hope you wo n't give up . You 're an officer . You 've had a brilliant career . " Not a muscle stirred . Captain Newman lighted a cigarette and held it before Mr. Future 's lips . " We could have one last smoke together . . . " Nothing . " Are you angry with me ? " No sound , no movement . Captain Newman rose . " This is good-by , then . " He felt awkward  --  inept and defeated . " Good luck . Colonel Norval Algate Bliss . " The arms stayed folded , the head high , the eyes frozen . Captain Newman was halfway out of the room when he heard a whisper , ' ' Captain ... " Quickly , he stepped back . Mr. Future did not shift that frigid- pose by so much as a hair as , in a monotone , he whispered , " Tell her  --  I tried . " " Who ? " " The one  --  whose name is written . " Captain Newman forced a cheerful note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Maybe she 'll come ? " " I am now entering a state of catatonia . These are the last words that shall ever pass my lips . " " Wait ! What about Mr. Past ? " There was no answer . " Do n't do this to him ! " exclaimed Newman . " He 's part of you . Where can he go if you leave ? Where ? To whom ? " A shield , glazed , impenetrable , covered those blue , blue eyes . " Think , Norval ! Mr. Past  --  he has no place to go , no place on earth , except to you . He under-stands you . He needs you . You need him . To-gether , you can be whole ? " Not even a tremor touched the lips or eyes or beard . Mr. Future had entered the future , and would not return . I W A S asleep , restlessly , tossing , vaguely aware of the heavy , stifling air , of wheels of thunder rolling across the heavens , when my ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . My room , for a startling moment , seemed on fire . I heard something crash overhead and voices cursing in the next room . I yanked my trousers over my pajamas . There would be trouble in the ward ; there always was during a storm , especially with lightning , worst of all with thunder . I could hear windows slamming all around me . As lightning serrated the sky , the post became a surrealistic set on some strange , forbidding stage , lighted up and blacked out in a flash . I ran down the porch steps , cut across the corner of the parade grounds . Clouds  --  muddy , restless , angry  --  churned across the moonless firmament . Phantoms were hurrying to the hospital , a looming presence in which patches of light were popping . I heard the agitation inside , the wails of fear , the whimpers of pain reawakened . As I went through the swinging doors , even before I hit the ramp , I heard the screaming in Ward 7 . No one was at the iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in turmoil . Nurses and orderlies were hurrying from bed to bed , trying to calm the men . Some had pulled sheets over their heads , several had covered their heads with pillows . Carho Wilkes was sprawled on the floor , face down , hands clapped over his ears . Nasty Nevers was standing on his bed , shaking his fist , howling about the avenging angel and cesspools of corruption . Lawrence let me in . His face was the color of milk . I saw Captain Newman head for Room E , where Laibowitz was pounding on the door . " He 's got the goddam bed jammed against the door or something ! " Captain Newman motioned him aside and tried the door . It did not budge . " Mr. Future ! " He knocked on the door . " It 's Captain Newman ! Open the door ! " Room E was silent . A nurse came down the aisle . " I found him at my locker this afternoon , trying to jimmy it open . " Captain Newman rattled the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 have news ! Important ! I just heard from Mr. Past ! " A rustle , inside the room . " Mr. Past  --  is on his way ! To join you . He says he 'll never leave you ! Do you hear me ? He 'll never leave you alone again . " We heard the bed being shoved away . The door swung back on its hinges . The nurse shuddered . Against the dim light , Colonel Norval Algate Bliss stood silhouetted . He had shaved off his beard and mustache . He was clad in a feathery kimono , stolen from one of the nurses ' lockers . He had rouged his cheeks . " Come in , dearie , " he smiled .
