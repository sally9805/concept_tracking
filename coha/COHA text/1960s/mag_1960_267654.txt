If any proof were needed that New England Industrialist Bernard Goldfine no longer has any White House influence , it came in a blockbusting indictment from a federal grand jury in Boston . The longtime crony of ex-Presidential Aide Sherman Adams was smitten with two charges : evasion of personal income taxes ( 1953-57 ) amounting to a whopping $450,961 , and dodging corporate income taxes ( 1952-57 ) , owed by his Strathmore Woolen Co. , to the tune of $340,784 . <P> On a local TV program . Kansas City 's forthright Artist Thomas Hart Benton , 70 , broke off from mural painting in the nearby library of his old friend , Harry Truman , to lower a heavy easel on Russian art . Said he : " They have no use whatever for all this individualism , abstract impressionism , and what Harry-President Truman-calls ' ham-and-egg art . . . ' The only good art they ever had was the art the church took out of Byzantine Greece into Russia-the making of those icons . Their realistic art is the worst kind of art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the middle of the last century . It 's worse than our advertising art , which is bad enough . It 's exactly Madison Avenue turned to political purposes . " <P> At a Manhattan premiere of the movie Can-Can ( see CINEMA ) , New York University Junior Carol Heiss , 20 , newly crowned queen of Olympic figure skating , showed up with a fellow bladesman , Dick Button , 30 , who won the men 's title in the 1948 and 1952 Winter Olympics . Earlier , in properly cold weather , Carol was honored by some 250,000 admirers , who cheered her way up snow-lined lower Broadway . After she had kissed Mayor Robert Wagner Jr . seven , times ( once for him , six more times for photographers ) , His Honor piped : " Best thing that 's happened to me all day ! " <P> Japan 's commoners caught their first glimpse of their new prince , Naruhito Hironomiya , and his commoner mother , Crown Princess Michiko . All bundled against the cold , the two-week-old princeling was whisked from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Akihito . <P> Plans for transforming Britain 's betrothed Princess Margaret into plain Mrs. Antony Armstrong-Jones jelled in London . The wedding , to be conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury in Westminster Abbey on May 6 , will be one of the most lavish ever held in England . The BBC pushed on confidently with preparations for a live telecast of the ceremony . <P> The University of Pittsburgh 's Dr. Jonas Salk proved to be as good at sidestepping academic wrangling as he was at subduing the polio virus . Next year he will leave Pittsburgh , where he has recently been at odds with the University 's administration , go to San Diego , where he will head the projected Institute for Biological Research , adjoining the University of California 's La Jolla campus . The institute will be financed by private sources , will presumably give brilliant , self-contained Jonas Salk the job he wants most : being his own boss .
