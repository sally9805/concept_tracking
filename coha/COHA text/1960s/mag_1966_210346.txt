The Right Rev. James A. Pike , Episcopal Bishop of California , has been in charge of one of his church 's fastest-growing dioceses for eight years , during which time he has also become absorbed in exploring the frontiers of modern theology . Deciding that he could not adequately do both , the yeasty and iconoclastic prelate last week announced that he will resign his see and become a member of the resident staff of Robert Hutchins ' Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions in Santa Barbara . MIND OVER MITER , headlined the New York Daily News . <P> " I had to make a decision-I 'm not twins , " Pike explained . " I have been aware of an overextension of two roles : that of administrator and leader as bishop , and that of teacher-scholar . " Last fall , tired by his double duties , Pike , who is now 53 , took a six-month sabbatical , spent most of it studying at Cambridge University . There , he said , " I experienced the sheer joy of staying with something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pike 's return to San Francisco , Hutchins , a longtime friend , suggested that he join the Center . Pike then submitted his resignation to the standing committee of the diocese , which accepted it " with deep regret , " and to Presiding Bishop John Hines . If the House of Bishops agrees , Pike will keep his standing on three committees of the church . The Center will pick up Pike 's salary of about $17,000 a year . <P> Another factor in Pike 's decision may well have been the suicide of his eldest son last February , giving him a burden of sorrow to bear on top of his heavy duties . Under the circumstances , it is almost certain that the House of Bishops will let Pike go . Some prelates , in fact , will be delighted to see him leave the active hierarchy , since he has persistently outraged colleagues with his unconventional theological views . Pike has expressly denied the Incarnation , the Trinity , the Virgin birth and the physical resurrection of Christ . <P> As a self-supporting worker-bishop , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among issues that he intends to study at the Center : the role of " the church as a democratic institution and how it relates to other institutions in our society , " the theological implications of the Dead Sea Scrolls .
