The verdict is in . Deep South juries still will not convict a white man for murdering a Negro or another white man who pleads the Negro 's cause . The acquittal of Deputy Sheriff Thomas Coleman in Hayneville , Ala , in the slaying of theology student Jonathan Daniels has only confirmed what already had been demonstrated in trial after trial But the current exclamations of outrage , the scurrying about - for remedy on the part of reasonable Americans , might lead an outsider to think that some new phenomenon of injustice had suddenly appeared . It is , of course , as much a part of our judicial scene as juries themselves , and this furnishes the key to cause and possible remedy . By unofficial and modest count , there have been twenty-one civil rights murders in the deep South since 1961 . Not one white man has been convicted of murder in any of these crimes , although white guilt has often been palpable To stretch the count back into earlier decades would only increase numerical proof of a moral , certainty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters . ' Dr. Martin Luther King said : " It is obviously clear that federal anti-lynch legislation must be passed " Alabama Attorney General Richmond Flowers , who tried to take the Coleman prosecution out of local racist hands , only to be thwarted by Circuit Judge T. Werth Thagard , declared ? " Those , who feel they have a license to kill , destroy and cripple now have been assured that license . It is our duty to do what is necessary to retrieve it " And the New York Post ' said of the white people of Lowndes County : " But even they , in their innermost hearts , must have quailed at the chief defense attorney 's post-trial comment . ' Tom Coleman has been tried in a temple of justice . . . " Decent men feel passionate about Hayneville because the miscarriage Paul Good is a journalist who has been on assignment in the Southern states for the past eighteen months . He is writing a book on the South . of justice was as gross as the death of Daniels and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a well-thumbed and bloody script , the defense  --  backed by state police  --  said that young Daniels had flashed a switchblade knife as he and his black and white friends sought to enter a general store where Coleman stood guard with a 12-gauge automatic shotgun . A few months before his murder , while he still was ministering in Selma , Daniels had written : There are good men here , just as there are bad men . . . . Sometimes we confront the posse , and sometimes we hold a child Sometimes we stand with men who have learned to hate , and sometimes we must stand a little apart from them Our lives in Selma are filled with ambiguity , and zn that we share with men everywhere . We are beginning to see the world as we never saw it before We are truly in the world , and yet ultimately not of it For through the bramble bush of doubt and fear and supposed success we are groping our way to the realization that above all else , we are called to be saints That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Selma , Ala , is like all the world : it needs the life and witness of militant saints . It takes a certain kind of American juror to believe , in the face of this testament and the plausible evidence , that Daniels advanced on an armed deputy , switch-blade knife in hand . But one familiar with trials of recent years knows there is nothing that Southern white jurors will hot believe or purport to believe in defense of their pigmented supremacy. , For example , I think of the second trial of Byron de la Beckwith for the ambush slaying of Jackson NAACP leader Medgar Evers . During the first trial , which ended in a hung jury , scales of justice hanging on the wall above the judge 's bench had been tilted . , The press commented and the scales were straightened for the second trial , hanging neat and balanced as the prosecutor told the jury . " I am a segregationist . I believe it . I do n't believe any possibility of good coming from forced mixing of the races . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men He knew that however persuasive his evidence he must win a trial- within a trial by convincing the jurors not to deny justice in the name of segregation . I remember de la Beck-with smirking as the prosecution placed in evidence a letter he had . written to a magazine after the murder , offering an article about " shooting at night at varmints in the summertime . " Three policemen ( white , naturally ) from de la Beckwith 's home town testified that they bad seen him there when the murder was being committed in Jackson with his gun , and another jury was hung . De la Beckwith went back to Greenwood and immediately resumed his Negro-baiting . The Mississippi prosecution , unlike that in Hayneville , had at least tried . In Georgia , when Lemuel Penn , a Washington , D.C. , Negro educator unconnected with the civil rights movement , was slain as he drove home from army duty , the prosecution tried still harder ' Negroes even appeared on the jury list in Madison County . " We read in the papers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court said you hadn to have both colored and white in the jury box . Up to this term of court , there 's never been a nigger in that box . " Two Negroes were called but neither was chosen . Ku Klux Klansmen J. Howard Sims and Cecil Myers had been identified as the murderers in a confession made to the FBI by fellow Klansman James Lackey . The prosecution did not pander to white supremacy as had been done in Jackson , did not use the word " nigger " The judge ; Carey Skelton , was an urbane man , a friend of the late President Kennedy , and a respected jurist . Yet Georgia 's efforts availed nothing . A florid-faced 60-year-old defense lawyer addressed his neighbors in the jury box , flailing his arms and shouting ? " Gentlemen , I am not afraid to stand up against the untold resources of the federal government because I am standing in the presence of the symbol of the greatest tradition mankind has ever known . . . the jury system . . twelve good men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rich Anglo-Saxon blood and the milk of human kindness . " He went on from this dripping metaphor to an apoplectic denunciation of Washington for having sent the FBI to Georgia with instructions to " bring back white meat . " I watched Klansmen fill the courtroom and Negroes disappear as the jury returned and the defendants stood with arms folded in a secret Klan attitude . The verdict was acquittal . The next night at a Klan ' rally in Atlanta , Klan Wizard James - Venable told an assembly of the robed faithful : You 'll never be able to convict a ' ?  -- iiiliftcion'an that kills a nigger what enerdeidlies on the white race , of the South . They tried it in . Philadelphia where the three Mississippi civil rights workers were slain and over in Danielsville . You see a jury there last night turn ' em scot free Now , Mr Hoover and Mr. Johnson , what do you say about that ' ? What do we say about that ? , What do we do about " twelve good men and true " who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Demands for federal anti-lynch laws are the impassioned call from a national sense of frustrated justice . This sense was pricked by the inexplicably casual reaction of U S. Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach : I think this kind of result is expected from time to time This is the price you have to pay for the jury system , but I do n't think it is too high a price to pay In light of decades of such unvarying verdicts , Mr Katzenbach perhaps knows what he meant by " from time to time . " But federal antblynch or personal security laws raise questions both constitutionally grave and practically complex . Assuming , for example , that a satisfactory definition of civil rights murder could be drawn and made to . hold legal water , and assuming the Supreme Court ruled it constitutional , how would it work ' ? Would indictments be obtained from federal grand juries chosen from the deep South areas where the crimes were committed ' ? If so , past experience gives no assurance that white federal grand jurors would , invariably function with more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurors October 25 , 1965 would either " be picked from local venires or else the cases would have to be tried without a jury before federal judges , thus depriving defendants of their right to jury trial . It has also been suggested that such cases might be removed North , possibly to Washington , where some kind of super-federal juries would sit . But this immediately smacks of police state-ism , perhaps ' even of Kafka ? select government jurors somehow pruned of passions , creatures of central ' authority invested with the awful power to condemn whomever the government brings before them . Faced with these alternatives , Sen. Clifford Case ( R , N.J. ) winced at Katzenbach 's detached reaction and said . The federal government is not impotent . It has ' the power and we can find ways to provide adequate protection of the constitutional lights of . all our citizens anywhere in the United States . Senator Case ' has several bills pending in the Senate Judiciary Committee  --  some , co-sponsored by New York Sen : o Jacob Javits  --  to promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law They are mainly designed to put more bite in existing laws . One , foin , example , increases penalties against those who harm a person while attempting to deprive him of his civil rights . Another would , make municipalities liable for damages arising from civil suits when a policeman or sheriff is guilty of such , deprivation . Civil action by the families of Daniels or Father Morrisroe  --  against Lowndes County might come under the - put- view of this legislation . But none of these remedies seems to go to the heart of the malady  --  the " twelve . good men and true . " Charles Morgan , a former Birmingham attorney hounded out of the city in 1963 for his civil rights efforts , and now director of the American Civil Liberties Union Southern regional office , says of Mr. Katzenbach 's statement , on the price of a jury system : " I 'm willing to pay any price too And speaking of the jury system , I think we ought to try our jury system some time . " Mr. Morgan 's ' contention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits that are approaching Court hearings , is that enough legislation presently exists to prevent judicial travesties like Hayneville , the government has only to use it . " The cry for fresh federal legislation lets the federal government off the hook , " he says . " I 'm not saying I 'm against an enforceable personal security law . Maybe with one we could protect civil rights workers better . But we will be ignoring every other aspect of the American system of justice by doing that alone . We have the obligation to work things out so that the average Negro or poor person is not afraid of the law whether it is in Lowndes County or in Cook County , Illinois " Mr. Morgan cites Lowndes as an example of how the quality of justice in the deep South might be dramatically improved if the hallowed concept of the jury system were made a reality . The county is about 80 per cent Negro , yet only in the last year were the names of two Negroes placed on the jury rolls for tie first time since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obtain a temporary injunction barring all criminal trials in the county on the ground that Negroes were systematically excluded from juries . Sixty names were called in the venire from which the Coleman jurors were chosen . No Negro name was among them , but coincidentally enough , Coleman 's was . From all accounts , no Justice Department officials were present in court to witness this aberration of the jury system . That is nothing new  --  the department has a history , North and South , of indifference to flagrant injustice in the form of state and federal jury selections . Mr. Morgan argues that if Negroes had been represented in anything like mathematical proportion , the jury would have been predominantly or totally black . This is anathema to most white Alabamians , who insist that justice is a white hand protruding from a black robe . But the federal government should not adopt the Alabama point ' of view A predominantly black jury is no insurance of justice , of course , but in civil rights cases , it could be a guarantee that judge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the determining . if officially unsubmitted , prime exhibit . Morgan reasons further : Or consider the de la Beckwith trial . If Jackson 's 40 per cent Negro population was anything like represented on the venire , you would have had a black and white jury . Or else defense lawyers would have wasted all their peremptory challenges on the Negroes . Whether Beckwith were guilty or not , some whites on that jury did vote to convict , looking past prejudice You would have had more white men of that caliber sitting if the selection system were fair and equal . We are constricted under a system of segregated justice from the jury list to the clerk of the court , the bailiffs , the prosecutors , the - state and local police , the defense lawyers and the judges . Intraracial Negro crime is judged pa -- ternalistically with light sentences encouraging racial self-degredation In civil damage suits , a Negro leg , broken or amputated , is worth one-fifth the settlement for a white leg . But we haiie - the - weapons to break this ring of segregated justice at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otit that the Justice Department could immediately begin prosecutions under Title XVIII , Section 243 of the U. S code This bars the systematic exclusion of any qualified citizen from jury service and authorizes a $5,000 fine against the jury commissioner or judge guilty of fostering such exclusion . It has been enforced only once since it went on the books in the Reconstruction days of the 1870s . It is true that in the past individual appeals front Negro criminal defendants have successfully been argued before the Supreme Court on the grounds of exclusion But none of these has been hi the form of a class action which would open the door to sweeping injunctive recourse against officials in places like Lowndes County . On November 26 , the ACLU will go before a threelndge federal court in Montgoniery iii a jury exclusion case which could prove historic . Its suit is entitled Gardenia White v. Bruce Crook . Crook is the Lowndes County jury commissioner ; Miss White is a Negro resident of the county It is a class action and she is joined by others , including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cite Section 1983 , Title 42 ( and others ) of the U.S code which deals with deprival of civil rights , in this case as applying to jury service . If successful in Montgomery or on appeal to the Supreme Court , it could be the wedge opening Southern jury boxes to Negroes . ? On Dec 16 , in New Orleans , the full Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals will hear six more exclusion cases . Four apply to state jury ' lists , two to federal rolls . The ' ACLU will present an array of citations asserting that there is already available ample legal recourse to end racially stacked juries . On the federal level , a rule of criminal procedure enables the Justice Department to challenge federal grand jurors . And when it comes to the states , ACLU 's Morgan will argue in Billingsley v. Clayton that the United States generally and Jefferson County ' ( Birmingham ) in particular empanels Literary Digest juries The reference is to the disastrous Literary Digest poll of 1936 that predicted Alfred Landon wouldwin the Presidential election . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that neatly  --  and embarrassingly for the magazine  --  excluded the mass of the poor . " This will be the first case of its kind to reach any appellate court in the country , " Mr , Morgan says . " If the poor  --  and the Negro minority is predominant among the poor ? are entitled to representation in a poverty program , surely they 're entitled to representation on juries . We 've passed a voting bill this'year . But the Western world gave men the right to serve on juries long before they had the right to vote . " The American jury system is a shambles , North and South . There are , for example , ninety-two federal district courts and ninety-two different jury-selection systems . It would seem urgent business for the Congress , as it reapportions in order to assure legislative equality and the one-man , one-vote concept , to move to insure that every qualified American is guaranteed a democratic jury vote  --  both when he casts it and when he awaits its outcome . Such a law or court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flood of appeals from men now in prison for retroactive justice . This undoubtedly plays a part in Justice Department inertia concerning the issue . But retroactive justice , however legally complicating , must be preferable to condoning injustice by perpetuating it . If an honest jury system were established , Byron de la Beckwith could be retried The Alabama state trooper who allegedly murdered Negro Jimmy Lee Jackson last spring in Marion , ' and whom a Perry County grand jury refused to indict during the same week Coleman was acquitted , could be indicted and tried . The Klansmen accused of killing the three Philadelphia civil rights workers would have their day in an interracial court . The ghostly ranks of those who have died in the South for human rights can never be wholly avenged , nor should vengeance be the driving purpose But a dynamic and democratic justice that can punish can also by example give pause to those who would strike the defenseless . The South has seen enough martyrdoms . The conscience of this Republic can bear no more .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
