txt WASHINGT.ON , April ** the first time in his life , John F. Kennedy has taken a public licking . He has " faced illness and - even death in his 43 years , but defeat is something new to him , and Cuba was a clumsy , and humiliating one , which makes . it worse . How be reacts to , it may very well be more important than how he got into fit . " or this will be a critical test of the character and perspective of the new President , and of the brilliant young men he has brought to the pinnacle of American political power . The temptation ' to lash back= and " get even " in Cuba is very great . The politician 's natural reaction to a dramatic defeat is to ' try for a dramatic victory as soon as possible . He has the power to do . so . No doubt the proud spirit of the country would support his landing the Marines in Cuba . Moreover , former President Eisenhower , who knows the agony of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support him . Former Vice President Nixon is quoted as saying publicly that he wonld go along even if this meant putting United States forces on the beaches in Cuba . And some of the President 's closest advisers , deeply- Involved in the defeat , are eager to recoup the losses of the last few days . Sudden Diplomacy ? Nevertheless , this is no time for sudden action , but for a little more careful reflection and staff work than went into the original decision to allow the buban refugees to engage the prestige of the : United States . Cuba is not a present danger to the United States . Even if and when it gets the 150 Communist MIG fighter planes and the Cuban pilots now being trained in Czechoslovakia  --  the fear of which played such an important part in the decision to launch this week 's adventure  --  this is no serious menace to the security of the Republic . As the President said in his press conference yesterday , the threat of the rising power and ideology of Cuba is more of a menace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Latin America than it is to the United States , but if Castro tries to use his military power against any other state in UK Caribbean or the hemisphere , then the issue will be clear . At that point , the United States can wipe him out , with the requisite sanction of law on its side . After all , the mere presence of .. military force in a weak country is not necessarily a threat to a strong country . Turkey , for example , has been getting from the United States far more power than Castro ever dreamed of getting from the Russians . This United States power , including even rockets with nuclear warheads , has been situated in Turkey for a . long time , but the Russians , while annoyed by this fact , have not felt obliged to use their power to invade Turkey . Kennedy 's Approach . It all depends on how President Kennedy looks at all this . He can look at it ' in personal and political terms and concentrate on redressing the blunders of the last few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In other ? words , he can put the immediate situation ahead of all the other world-wide social and economic programs he has been working so hard to emphasize ever ' since he came to power . On the other hand , he can look at the wider world picture , now greatly darkened by the events in Laos and the sudden insurrection of the French Army that has broken out in Algeria . He , can try to deal with social and economic problems in Cuba by military means , and risk the whole inter-American and United Nations systems in the process .. Bin it does come back to , his personal decision . He has the authority to act in historic and world terms or in terms of the limited immediate problems of the Cuban crisis . Either way the decision will involve risks . This is a gloomy and impatient city this ' week-tnd . It is acting as if this were the last half of the ninth inning and Cuba were vital to the security of the United States , whereas the facts are that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuba can be dealt - with at w:Iatever time the President likes . Kennedy , in short , is now facing not only Caster and Khrushchev but the history and meaning of the American story , and how he reacts to it will tell a lot about the kind of leadership he has in mind to offer for the United States and the free world .
