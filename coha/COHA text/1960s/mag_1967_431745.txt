 | The Twnety-First Century : The World You 'll Live In In a very real way , I 've traveled 33 years into the future ? to the year 2000 and bevond . As a CBS News correspondent responsible for a television series called The , t Century CBS-TV , Sundays at six p.m. astern Time , I 've tested some of the Aware of tomorrow : the vehicles with Lich we may explore the moon , the automatic cars in which we 'll ride to work , the research submarines that will take us to the ocean floor , I 've talked to scientists , engineers , doctors , many eminent authorities who have given me a truly revealing glimpse of the future . As part of The 21st Century I 've had a medical checkup by a " mechanical doctor , " helped pilot a hovercraft , listened in on signals from outer space at Jodrell Bank , . ten artificial foods used in our space program , and talked to scientists about what life will be like just 33 years from now when the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion . Driving on the moon . What 's it like ? Well , we can give you a pretty good idea . At Peconic , Long Island , Grumman Aircraft has built an artificial moonscape to test their Mobile Base Simulator or MOLAB . MOLAB is an electric four-wheel tractortrailer every bit as fantastic as the rest of the space program . The huge , weird-looking barrel-hoop wheels with flexible spiral spokes , driven at the hubs by reversible electric motors , will take MOLAB over the surface of the moon . They 're also what makes MOLAB fun to drive . The wheel spokes and rims are so limber the vehicle almost seems to float ? it 's like an amusement-park ride . You go bouncing  | through craters and over obstructions ; even movement inside the vehicle causes it to shake like a bowl of jell-O . I set a new speed record : 12 m.p.h . If this seems unimpressive , remember that this buggy is not designed for speed . It takes wide treads and those sagging wheels , which give a footprint three times larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it goes churning through craters . Computerized cars . I drove a car for use right here on earth that was equipped with General Motors ' DAIR system Driver Aid , Information and Routing ; PS . Nov. ' 66 , which goes a long way toward automating driving . With DAIR , when you want to take a vacation trip , your gasoline company gives you a card ? a tour-guide , that looks like a credit card ? instead of the usual map marked with a heavy red line . In your car is a device that resembles the receipt-writing gadgets used with credit cards . You simply push your card in , press a button , and you 're ready to go . As I drove the test car . DAIR navigated for , me , telling me when to go straight , turn @# left , turn right , and so on . How dote work ? Its decoder responds to magnets bedded in the roadway . Another part of the system is a dashboard display panel for road information . drove around the GM test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panel activated by low-power transmitalong the roadway . As part of the demonstration , a voice override came up and s .. " Caution , accident ahead , " and then , -a later , " Icy road . " I also tested the built telephone , based on simple Citizens B .. radio equipment , which is part of the DA system . You dial a coded emergency message which connects you with the police garage . Far-out vehicles . Another type of transportation in the 21st century may be road-rail Alden StaRRcar which I drove a highway , and then rode in as it travel , completely automatically , along an elec. fled rail . It 's a two-man electric car . the future , such tracks may carry your on commuting runs and long cross-core trips . When you arrive at your destinat you 'll simply drive off the track and 1 . your car free for local travel . I 've also driven other far-out vehicles GM 's single-stick-control Eight Ball and t Chrysler 300X , to mention just two . I fir across San Francisco Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 65 any ? traveled to the ocean bottom in a reseal sub , the Westinghouse Deepstar-4000 . My underwater trip to the continent shelf 2,500 feet down , 13 miles off S .. Diego , brought me to a surprising spot barren as a desert . With all its barrennes though , I learned that much of the world ' wealth ? minerals , petroleum , and food stuffs ? lies beneath the ocean . In the 21 century , as never before , we will be depending on this underwater wealth for survival . How you will live . Through the window we 've opened into the 21st century we'v seen miracles in the biological sciences tha will mean a longer and happier life for all Eventually , the doctors told me , we will replace almost every body component as it wears out : kidneys , heart , bones , to mention just a few . Another feature medicine will offer in t  | years to come is a " mechanical doctor " ? like Philco 's medical monitoring chair PS , Sept. ' 66 . It looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully clothed with my ' ids on the arms . I felt no sensation . A ht bulge at the back held a microphone . I was told there were concealed sensors 1r : the arms . In a few seconds , the doctor slowed me my examination results : a cornlete electrocardiogram as well as other gists , neatly printed on graph paper . In filming The 21st Century for CBS : t is sponsored by Union Carbide ) , we were visited homes of the future , talked bout what your food and furniture will be ke . I 'm convinced that in the home of the 21st century all those nuisance chores you and your wife now have to take care of will be done by robots . Hard to believe ? Well , I watched model robots built by Prof. M. W. Thring of Queen Mary College in London do such things as handle tools , walk , talk , crawl , and demonstrate other remarkable skills . The robots are small prototypes ; each has the artificial " organs " ? " arms , " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box , " for example ? required to do a particular job . What about money ? For some thoughts on what your income and standard of living will be in the 21st century , I talked to futurist Herman Kahn , Director of the Hudson Institute . He told me that the average household income after taxes in the year 2000 might easily be $15,000 to $25,000 . Despite the increase in your income , you will work only four days a week , 7 i hours a day , have three-day weekends , 10 holidays a year , and three-month vacations ! What does the 21st century hold ? After doing such things as joining in while a computer-synthesized voice sang Daisy , sitting on furniture made entirely of paper ( very sturdy ) , and watching the operation of a kilowatt laser capable of blasting rock to dust , anything seems possible . It seems probable that we will not only explore the moon with our lunar vehicles , but that we 'll mine it for minerals we can use , and colonize it as well . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within our solar system . After having lived in the future as far as it is possible , I can tell you that an exciting prospect is in store : We will lead richer lives , go places we have never been before , and do things undreamed of today .
