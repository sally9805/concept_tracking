The story of a fish is not always a fish story . But any story about Big Daddy sounds like one . Big Daddy is an Atlantic blue marlin . Nobody knows how big he is , but he is no smaller than 1,000 lbs . Nobody knows , either , how many of him there are , but his nickname is surely generic . And he is the most coveted catch in the sea . <P> <P> Tommy Gifford has seen Big Daddy " at least six times . " A charterboat captain for 50 years , Gifford , 71 , had his first encounter with a giant blue off Bimini in 1936 . " I was skippering for a fisherman named Mike Lerner , " recalls Gifford , " and we hooked into this fish at 3 p.m . What a scene that was ! The marlin jumped 25 times , and tail-walked through the entire fleet of boats . At one point , he jumped so close to my boat that he threw barrels of water into our faces and darned near drowned us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14/0 hook into a hatpin and broke off . I would guess that he weighed at least 1,800 lbs . " <P> Dozens of other anglers have tangled with Big Daddy-and always come off second best . A few years ago , Bermuda 's Captain Russell Young had an epic 31-hour battle with a marlin that he estimated at 15 ft. long . Young actually brought the fish to gaff six times . Each time the gaff tore loose , and Big Daddy finally escaped when the line parted . Last year Dr. Lyman Spire of Fayetteville , N.Y. , was trolling off St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands when a monster blue crashed the bait on his ul tralight 12-lb. - test line . Spire was so discombobulated that he " bird's-nested " his reel ; the line snapped . " It 's just as well , " he sighed . " Otherwise I would have lost all that good line . " <P> High Price . One big incentive behind the hunt for Big Daddy is the price on his head . Miami 's Tycoon/Fin-Nor Corp . will pay $5,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its fishing tackle ; there is another $1-per-lb. reward if the fish is caught off the Virgin Islands , and $10,000 if it is boated off Puerto Rico . <P> <P> Closest yet to the prize was a catch made on July 4 off St. Thomas by an experienced and appropriately named big-game angler who already had 20 blues to his credit . Aboard Captain Johnny Harms 's Savana Bay , Elliot Fishman had just reached the grounds and was still wiping his sunglasses when it happened . " I glanced out , " he recalls , " and there was this s.o.b. , coming like blazes with his mouth wide open . I struck him , and that brute jumped 19 times . " It took Fishman 3 hrs. 28 min. to boat the marlin . At the dock four hours later ( during which time it undoubtedly lost weight by dehydration ) , the marlin measured 13 ft. 1 in. in length and tipped the scales at 845 lbs. -a new world record by 34 lbs . <P> Big Daddy is still out there waiting . Only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another Virgin Islander , was fighting a 700-lb. blue marlin when he looked over his shoulder and saw " ten or twelve others circling the boat , including one that had to be 20 ft. long . " The guesses on the weight of that fish range up to 2,000 lbs .
