For a man whose profession was synonymous with secrecy , Pilot Francis Gary Powers continued to be the most-talked-about man of the week-in the U.S. , in allied countries and in Russia , where his pictures were plastered on exhibition walls and where he would soon oust both Dwight Eisenhower and Mark Twain as the best-known American . Bit by bit , a more complete story of his ill-fated U-2 jet flight to Sverdlovsk emerged from the grim , grey silence of international espionage . <P> Weather Watch . Powers took off from the U.S. Air Force base at Incirlik , near Adana , Turkey . April 27 , flew to Peshawar , Pakistan . There he fidgeted nervously , waiting to leave on his biggest mission ever . The demands of diplomacy scarcely figured in the delay ; he was looking for perfect weather . He was watching for that rare day when everything would be ideal , when winds aloft promised the necessary boost along the 3,500-mile flight across the Soviet Union toward Norway , when cloud cover would be at a minimum and there would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane would not form giveaway contrails . <P> Just five days after he landed at Peshawar , Powers got the go-ahead and took off . Friendly radars tracked him as far as they could across the Soviet frontier ; then a U.S. radio watch tuned in on Soviet defense frequencies . The chatter of frustrated Russians was familiar and reassuring to the U.S. monitors as the intruder was passed from one Russian military zone to another . U-2 penetrations were no secret to the Soviets ; Powers and other pilots had made them often during the past four years . The Russians had fired rockets , but the rockets had fallen short at some 60,000 ft. ; MIG fighter planes had flashed after them and had mushed helplessly at the same altitude , well below the U2 's lofty sanctuary of 80,000-100,000 ft . <P> Direct Hit ? This time the pattern changed . Over Sverdlovsk in the Soviet Urals , where his flight plan called for a half-left turn to take him northwestward toward Norway , Powers suddenly ran into trouble-probably an engine failure . " He 's coming lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outposts hung helplessly on every word while Russian antiaircraft batteries chattered tersely about the enemy plane spiraling downward into range . When the U-2 dropped to 40,000 ft. , the Russians stopped talking . <P> Proudly , the Russian press later reported how a " rocket rushed into the stratosphere with a powerful roar , " how " fragments of the foreign-spy aircraft fell through the rays of the May sun . " In an effort to prove that a Soviet rocket had scored a direct hit , Khrushchev himself displayed the picture of a thoroughly wrecked plane , at the same time showed off high-altitude pictures of Soviet installations which he said had been recovered from the U2 's cameras . This raised an obvious question : How had the cameras survived such a splintering crash ?
