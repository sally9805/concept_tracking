In dank , dark weather , Douglas Mac-Arthur 's body arrived in Manhattan . <P> There , in Park Avenue 's 7th Regiment Armory , mourners moved past him at a rate of some 3,000 an hour . Next morning , a cortege placed the plain , steel Army casket aboard a train that took MacArthur , his widow Jean and son Arthur , 26 , to Washington . It was raining as the procession headed slowly toward the Capitol , but tens of thousands lined the streets . In the rotunda President Johnson , his face working with emotion , placed a wreath at the casket 's head . A dirge sounded as a military honor guard took its post . <P> But , already , behind the threnody was heard the thunder of controversy that had accompanied MacArthur throughout so much of his lifetime . Appearing in print were the reports of two decade-old , off-the-record interviews with MacArthur . One , by Scripps-Howard Reporter Jim Lucas , was published in the form of a memo sent by Lucas to his bosses at the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Considine . Both portrayed MacArthur as an embittered man who had held the Communists " in the palm of my hand , " only to be " betrayed " by " those fools in Washington " and the British government . <P> Perfidy . According to Lucas , Mac-Arthur said that during the Korean War " every message he sent to Washington and every message sent by Washington to him was shown to the British by the State Department . " Within 48 hours , the messages were " relayed by the British , either through India or through the Russian Embassy in London , to the Chinese Communists . " Thus , said Lucas , the Chinese Communists " knew in advance every step he proposed to take , " and , in fact , entered the Korean conflict only " after being assured by the British that MacArthur would be ham strung and could not effectively oppose them . " MacArthur had long since made similar charges . In 1956 , he publicly charged that British Spies Guy Burgess and Donald MacLean , who had defected to Moscow five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Communists . <P> Both Lucas and Considine reported that MacArthur was disappointed in Dwight Eisenhower , whom he described as " once a man of integrity . " General George Marshall , who was Secretary of Defense during the Korean War , was " the errand boy of the State Department . " General Matthew Ridgway , who took over command of United Nations forces after MacArthur 's dismissal , was a " chameleon , " who " did a complete flip-flop in 24 hours " when he discovered that Washington opposed Mac-Arthur 's war strategy . General Maxwell Taylor was " an ambitious man who will never do anything to jeopardize his career . " <P> By the Lucas account , MacArthur had a grudging respect for Harry Truman . The President had been in Inde pendence , Mo. , when the Korean War started , recalled MacArthur . Truman " reacted instinctively , like the gutter fighter he is-and you 've got to admire him . " But once Truman got back to Washington , " Dean Acheson brought him back under control . " All in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw courage and guts-the little bastard honestly believes he is a patriot .
