The U.S. Has the Opportunity &; the Tools <P> WHY have U.S. exports fallen ? The popular complaint of businessmen is that the U.S. is being priced out of world markets by rising labor costs . <P> But many foreign-trade experts are convinced that the biggest problem is a plain lack of salesmanship : the U.S. businessman has simply not tried hard enough to sell his products abroad . <P> Says Federal Reserve Chairman William McChesney Martin Jr. : " Our foreign business is the neglected child of American business . " Even though the traditional spread between U.S. exports and imports has narrowed dangerously , comparatively few businessmen have stepped up foreign selling efforts . The lag is not for any lack of opportunity . In recent years the U.S. has made great strides in persuading foreign nations to lower tariff barriers . Yet the Commerce Department reported that only 10,000 firms out of the 4,600,000 in the U.S. have any interest in exporting . Many companies , added Commerce , do not answer repeated letters of inquiry from prospective foreign customers . <P> Big corporations such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cash Register , which have full-scale international divisions and plants abroad , know how profitable trade can be . But smaller companies , which can not invest millions to make millions , tend to shrug off export sales , regard them only as a dumping ground for surplus domestic production . When there is an export department , it often operates at the lowest management level . <P> Just about every U.S. company extends credit-as liberal as possible-to its U.S. customers . But overseas , the same companies often demand cash on the barrelhead . Nor does the U.S. businessman research his foreign market as he does at home ; he is nowhere near as anxious to serve each customer 's special needs , is reluctant to modify his product to fit export needs . <P> Germany 's DEMAG steel construction company recently won an order for a steel mill in Portugal because it offered a " complete , individualized package , " while its U.S. competitors offered only a standard job , take it or leave it . <P> Says DEMAG : " The Americans pull out a blueprint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer 's wishes . " The U.S. also often falls down in the quantity and quality of its salesmen abroad . European and Japanese traders flood their markets with salesmen , make sure they are well-educated specialists with a solid knowledge of the language and the market . By contrast , the U.S. company often sends a man who does not even know the language , has so much ground to cover that he can answer queries only by mailing off a catalogue-printed in English as often as not . Many companies do not send a salesman at all , but turn their wares over to jobbers who operate as mere order takers . In Singapore , for example , one agent handles 70 companies . <P> The U.S. company too often sells more on price than with the emphasis on quality that makes it more economic in the long run to buy American .
