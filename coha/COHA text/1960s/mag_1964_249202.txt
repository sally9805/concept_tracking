Marrying outside the faith-even though Moses did it*-has traditionally been frowned upon by devout Jews . Some traditional families still mournfully recite the service for the dead when a rebellious son weds a shiksa . Nonetheless , the number of mixed marriages in the U.S. is at a level that may well threaten the survival of U.S. Jewry as a religious community . The reason : the Jewish partner often abandons his religious practice and raises his children in the faith , or nonfaith , of his spouse . <P> The few significant statistics on Judaism and interfaith marriages were summed up by Sociologist Erich Rosenthal in the 1963 American Jewish Year Book , prepared by the American Jewish Committee . In Greater Washington , D.C. , the rate of mixed marriages is 17.9% for Jews of the third generation and after , compared with 1.4% for foreign-born Jews . In at least 70% of such mixed marriages , the children are not raised as Jews . Assimilation is an even greater problem in small communities , where the Jewish choice of partners is limited ; in Iowa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews normally marry outside the faith . <P> Many Jewish leaders deplore the trend .

" <P> But other rabbis believe that intermarriage brings profits as well as losses . One gain is the small but steady national increase in converts to Judaism . " I do n't know of a rabbi who is n't constantly busy tutoring non-Jews who want to convert to Judaism , " says Dr. Max Vorspan of California 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an inevitable by-product of a worthy accomplishment , the general acceptance of Judaism in U.S. life . " We want tolerance , understanding and intergroup amity , " says Rabbi Joseph Narot of Miami 's Temple Israel . " And while this is more likely to bring about intermarriage , we 'll take our chances . We 've got to take that chance to avoid the ghetto mentality .
