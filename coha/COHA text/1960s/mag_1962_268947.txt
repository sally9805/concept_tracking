A Soviet Ilyushin-18 turboprop touched down at Belgrade 's military airport last week , rolled to a stop before a neat row of Communist-bloc diplomats that included every resident Red representative except the Albanians . Then the plane door popped open and out stepped Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko , his usual grouchy expression replaced by an almost friendly smile . <P> Officially , Gromyko 's visit to Yugoslavia was in return for a visit to Moscow last summer by Yugoslav Foreign Minister Koca Popovic . Punctiliously , the government newspaper Politika gave Gromyko 's arrival precisely the same space that Izvestia had allotted to Popovic . But there was more to Gromyko 's appearance in Belgrade than such formalities indicated . On the government level , Soviet-Yugoslav relations have become steadily warmer , even though party propagandists still practice the name-calling inspired by Tito 's 1948 split with Stalin . Khrushchev , faced with the new threat of a more serious break with Red China , has gradually made peace with Tito , who has used his considerable influence among European Communists to urge support for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked the Kremlin 's public acknowledgment of Belgrade 's valued backing . <P> Innovations Fail . But if the Soviets need Yugoslavia 's political aid , Yugoslavia now badly needs Soviet economic aid . Cut off both from Western Europe 's Common Market and Eastern Europe 's trade bloc , Comecon , the Yugoslav economy is on the point of collapse . Said one official of the Yugoslav National Bank last week : " We have more than $30 million worth of outstanding bills than we can pay . Our only prayer is that they do n't all come in at once . " <P> Last year Belgrade economists made sweeping innovations to decentralize industry , introduce competition by breaking up inefficient state monopolies and giving more control over wages to local factory managers . Though the aim was sensible , the result was chaos . <P> Communist bureaucrats refused to shut down a single outmoded plant , fearing the ire of unemployed workers . Cumbersome monopolies , which produce goods at inflated cost , lobbied successfully against establishing domestic rivals . Factory managers boosted wages by a staggering 23% , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Bank had to shell out scarce hard currency . At the same time , relaxed import barriers flooded Belgrade shops with French cognac , Italian shoes and other fancy consumer goods that the economy could not afford . <P> Unscheduled Chat . Last week the government finally stepped in , cut back the program for economic liberalization by tightening control over Communist Party planners . A new regulation asserts the right of the state " to interfere " when industry proposes new wage hikes .
