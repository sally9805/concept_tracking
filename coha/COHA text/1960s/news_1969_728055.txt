txt Washington , Sept. 4 ? The Nixon administration today urged the Senate to enact the proposed tax reform legislation " at the earliest practical date , " but also asked that the House-passed version be modified to lessen reductions for individuals and ease the tax burden of corporations . Appearing before the Senate finance committee was a delegation headed by Treasury Secretary David M. Kennedy . Urges Cut by Senate He termed the bill passed by the House shortly before the summer congressional recess as " the most sweeping tax reform measure in the history " of the income tax . However , he said the administration believes the amount of long-run tax reduction contained in the House version should be cut by about half , and the heavy increase in corporate taxes because of the proposed repeal of the 7 per cent investment tax credit should be eased thru a two- ' point reduction in the corporate tax rate . For individuals , the administration recommended that the House bill be modified to reduce the standard deduction from the proposed 15 per cent , $2,000 ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The deduction now is 10 per cent , with a ceiling of $1,000 . Accept Oil Amendment The administration also proposed a tax rate reduction for all single persons so that their taxes would not be 20 per cent higher than a married couple in a comparable income bracket . The House-passed bill would confer head-of-household status on single persons over 35 years old . To no one 's surprise , the administration disclosed it would accept the reduction adopted by the House in the oil depletion allowance to 20 per cent from the present 27 1/2 per cent level . However , Kennedy asked the Senate to restore the percentage depletion allowance to the limit on tax preferences L. T. P.1 , which limits the amount of income that can be sheltered from taxation . The administration also asked that so-called intangible drilling expenses be included under L. T. P. for investors who do not receive at least 60 per cent of their gross income from the sale of oil or gas . This provision would enable persons whose principal business is exploration for oil or gas to deduct some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the same time , Kennedy said , L. T. P. " should insure that substantially all taxpayers , including those in the oil business , will pay some reasonable amount of tax each year . " The secretary warned the committee that the House bill , which would reduce the national tax burden by 2.4 billion dollars a year , would be a significant decision with respect to national priorities . " He pointed out that interim revenue losses would be still greater because the full effect of the revenue raising features are stretched out . By agreeing to the administration 's recommended modifications , the expected shortage would be reduced to 1.3 billion , Kennedy said . The corporate tax under the treasury proposal would be reduced by 1 per percentage point in calendar year 1971 and an additional point in 1972 . This would bring the tax rate to 46 per cent from 48 per cent . Over-all , the net increase in corporate taxes would be cut to 3.5 billion from 4.9 billion .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
