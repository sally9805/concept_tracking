txt Abraham M , Lindenbaum , a central figure in the controversy over a Democratic fundraising luncheon , resigned late yesterday as a member of the City Planning Commission . He insisted he had " done nothing unethical " in presiding over the fund-raising at a Brooklyn luncheon last Wednesday at which $25,000 was raised for Mayor Wagner 's campaign for re-election . The forty - three contributors included real estate men and builders who do business with the city , but Mr. . Lindenbaum denied any impropriety . He maintained he was relinquishing his $11,730 post only ? because the luncheon had " become a subject of political controversy . " His resignation was submitted to James Felt , chairman of the Planning Commission , rather than to the Mayor , who had sat through the luncheon , which was held at Sakele 's Restaurant , 171 Montague Street . Statement by Mayor The resignation ? was made public just before a statement by the Mayor was issued saying he had instructed his campaign t yea:incr . Frank Quillinan , never " to accept . any contributions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city employe . " Chiding the Republicans for " suddenly discovered self-righteousness , " Mr. Wagner said the public would " become acquainted in the days ahead with brazen Republican , misconduct " in the area of campaign contributions . The resignation and the Mayor 's statement , rather than halting criticism , touched off a new wave of angry comment by Mr. Wagner 's principal opponents in the mayoral election . " If this is serious enough for Lindenbaum to resign , " said Controller Lawrence E. Gerosa , the Citizens party candidate , " it proves the Mayor should resign , too . He is guilty of the same act . " Coercion Is Charged And Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz , tile Republican candidate , charged the resignation had been forced , " obviously to take the heat off Mayor Wagner . " Urging District Attorney Edward S. Silver of Brooklyn to investigate , Mr. Lefkowitz said : " After all , Commissioner Lindenbaum could derive no direct benefit from the contributions . Mr. Lindenbaum was not in a position of violating the City Charter and the Code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prime beneficiary of the coerced contributors . He has dumped Commissioner Lindenbaum to save himself in this messy situation . " No one within the city administration would say whether Mr. Lindenbaum 's resignation had been requested . But the subject had been under discussion by the Mayor 's top advisers , all of them deeply concerned by the furor . Mr. Lindenbaum could not be reached for comment , but the text of his letter to Mr. Felt , dated yesterday , follows : " I regret that my attendance at a fund-raising luncheon , in the preparation for which I was in no way concerned , has caused controversy in the heat of a political campaign . " I feel I have done nothing unethical . I acted in good faith and with good intent in an open meeting attended by members of the press . " But because this luncheon has become a subject of political controversy , I hereby tender my resignation as a member of the City Planning Commission . " Doyle Hands Out Statement Minutes after the letter was released , the Mayor 's statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive secretary . It read : " Let me make clear exactly my policy on campaign contributions . I would never allow my campaign treasurer to accept any contributions from anyone seeking favors from the city or from any city employe . My campaign treasurer has been so instructed by me . " Let me add that my Republican opponents have , suddenly discovered self-righteousness on the subject of my campaign contributions and influence-peddling . The people will become acquainted in the days ahead with brazen Republican misconduct . " A City Hall aide said later that the last sentence of the Mayor 's statement had " particular significance , as will be seen . " The Mayor was not available at City Hall for comment . The spokesman said the Mayor would accept the Lindenbaum resignation when it reached him , presumably this morning . Mayor 's Role Cited Attorney General Lefkowitz pictured the Mayor as the one whose presence had made the Brooklyn fund-raising luncheon " so effective and so productive of contributions . " " The Lindenbaum resignation , " he said at the end of a 500-word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the participants in this shotgun shakedown and raises the question as to whether any of the other participants can be any less guilty of unethical if not illegal conduct . " In urging an investigation by the District Attorney , he said that the fund-raising luncheon constituted " the most cynical scandal yet to stain the Wagner administration , and this one touches the Mayor personally , " " I now repeat my request to Mayor Wagner , " Mr. Lefkowitz said , " that he make public the , names , positions and addresses of all city employes at the affair , the names and addresses ' of all realtors and builders present and a listing of their past and pending business dealings with the city government . The public is entitled to a full disclosure of all the facts . " Earlier in the day Mr. Gerosa had issued a statement urging former Senator Herbert H. Leh- , man and Mrs. Franklin Roosevelt to give their stand on " this outrage to public morality . " He said they owed it to the voters " to state now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Mayor .
