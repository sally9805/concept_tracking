Its atom contains only one proton and one electron , which makes it the lightest element known to science . It is completely colorless , completely odorless . And it is that ultimate simplicity that has earned for hydrogen some of the most sophisticated jobs in modern science . Refrigerated into a liquid state , hydrogen is helping physicists to peer into the heart of the atom , to trace the fleeting histories of the smallest building blocks of matter . Space scientists are depending on it to launch the Apollo spacecraft that will take the first U.S. astronauts to the moon . <P> Simplicity , however , is not hydrogen 's only attribute . In its liquid state , it is one of the most intractable and unforgiving substances on earth . It is given to violent explosions on the slightest opportunity . It was only natural that the very presence of a tank of liquid hydrogen was immediately blamed last week for the blasts that rocked the Harvard-M.I.T. electron accelerator laboratory at Cambridge and injured eight young scientists . <P> Investigators are still trying to determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buried 16 ft. below ground , was not damaged , and there was no danger of radioactivity . Still , the laboratory 's new bubble chamber for the study of subnuclear particles lay twisted and scorched in the $1,000,000 wreckage . When all the evidence has been studied , the deceptively simple element may yet be exonerated . But significantly , when the accident occurred , the scientists were cautiously handling hydrogen , piping it into the 100-gal. bubble chamber . <P> Vicious Problem . Although a British scientist , Sir James Dewar , first liquefied hydrogen in 1898 , it remained a mere curiosity until after World War II . Then it was enlisted as a tool in the modern specialty of cryogenics ( the science and technology of very low temperatures ) , which has been instrumental in developments ranging from exotic new metals to important new discoveries in superconductivity . Liquid hydrogen came into its own when it was put to use in bubble chambers for experiments in high-energy physics . In such studies , accelerators smash the nucleus of a hydrogen atom , scattering subnuclear debris through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paths of the tiny charged particles by their tracks of small bubbles . This technique , which was to have been used at Cambridge , has led to the discovery and identification of many new particles . <P> Valuable as liquid hydrogen is in the lab , though , the men who use it can never forget its dangerous characteristics . The trouble is , it really does not want to be a liquid . Forced into a fluid state by powerful refrigeration machines , it must be sealed in a double-walled vacuum container and kept constantly below its boiling point ( - 423 F. ) to control vaporization . As a liquid , it is not readily flammable . It is when it vaporizes and comes in contact with oxygen that hydrogen becomes explosive . Which makes for a vicious problem : how to let off the inevitable vapors and avoid rupture of the tank as a result of the pressure of expanding gas , without running the risk of a fire outside the tank . Surprisingly , there have been few serious accidents in handling the stuff .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
