With heavy humor , the Dutch claim that they made Rotterdam the Continent 's biggest and busiest port by dredging up enough sand to fill in its chief rival : West Germany 's Hamburg . Now Hamburg is beginning to laugh back . Continuing a rebuilding and expansion program that has cost more than $500 million since the end of World War II , the city has opened a $16 million " Overseas Center " to speed containerized shipping . And a harbor official foresees the day when " Hamburg will have no competition . " <P> Located 60 miles up the Elbe River from the North Sea , Hamburg handles about a third as much cargo as Rotterdam , which moves 130 million tons a year , mostly as the Common Market 's chief oil , grain and general cargo port . But Hamburg can point to some superlatives of its own . Its harbor can handle an impressive 320 oceangoing ships at a time . It claims that its warehouses , grain and fruit storage facilities , located in a duty-free perimeter , are the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the port hopes to attract 500,000 tons of cargo a year to its new Overseas Center , which will offer fast service from dockside sheds marked by color-red for North America , green for Europe , blue for South America , brown for Africa and yellow for Asia . <P> Not long ago , black and blue might have been more appropriate . Hamburg was reduced to rubble by Allied bombing , then emerged from the war to find itself only 30 miles away from the Iron Curtain , sealed off from a third of its prewar export-import market . But another , more fortunate geographical happenstance has since made up for the loss . Hamburg lies at the major water junction between the six Common Market nations and the seven-nation European Free Trade Association , a fact that has helped boost the port 's traffic to 37 million tons-170% more than its prewar peak . <P> Hamburgers are bargaining for more , with an apolitical pragmatism that sometimes embarrasses the Bonn government . As Britain 's traditional Central European port of entry , Hamburg has thumped for British membership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it cool ( TIME , Feb. 24 ) . Going ahead with their own independent " policy of the Elbe " to increase East-bloctrade-and possibly raise their port traffic by 10 million tons a year-Hamburg business leaders , led by the mayor , last fall toured Moscow and Leningrad , ignoring Bonn 's chilly relationship with the Soviets . Already , dozens of Hamburg brokers and agents specialize in trade with the Communist East Europe . <P> Bowing to pressure from the city , Bonn has agreed to build the long-disputed 75-mile North-South Canal to link Hamburg with Europe 's major canal systems . And within the next decade , Hamburg plans to meet Rotterdam 's superiority in handling the new supertankers by building a $125 million harbor " extension " where the shallow Elbe meets the North Sea , thus enabling deep-draft tankers to send their oil to Hamburg via pipeline .
