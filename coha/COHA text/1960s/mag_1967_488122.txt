Mr. Parks is chairman of the department of political science , Middle Tennessee State University . He has been an editorial writer on the Nashville Tennessean , and is the author of many articles on Southern politics and U S. foreign policy The Federal Communications Commission 's investigation into the American Telephone and Telegraph Company is being conducted in two sets of hearings , of which only the first set is completed . Important matters of regulation ? the corporate status of Western Electric , the manufacturing , repairing and purchasing arm of the Bell system , and AT &T's; position in the competitive areas of communication  --  remain to be considered in the second phase of the hearing this fall , and undoubtedly the company views this coming round with foreboding . But it can not be said that the monopoly came off badly in the phase just 430 closed . However , in establishing the interstate rate base , the commission did make some findings and some reservations for future determination which could result in more effective intrastate regulation by commissions willing to take the bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did cut some sizable chunks of fat from the interstate toll rate base . The FCC eliminated from the rate base all plant under construction ( $554 million ) * and reserved for later consideration the inclusion of unpaid for capitalized purchases from Western Union ( $56 million ) . It eliminated from working capital all funds not supplied by investors ( $309.7 million ) , these being moneys from advance payments by customers and reserves for taxes . Reserved for later determination was the California commission 's request that excess customer payments ( $108 *But in September , the FCC reversed itself on this item , permitting plant under construction to remain in the rate base . THE NATION/October 30 , 1967 million ) be treated as negative working capital and deducted from the rate base . That AT &T; was flourishing on a bloated income is shown in the disallowance of more than $750 million in the interstate rate base of approximately $8 billion , and the reduction of the rate of return from an actual 8.56 per cent in /966 to a proposed range of 7 to 7.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " separations " formula for dividing plant cost , transferred $85 million from intrastate to interstate . The forthcoming reduction in interstate toll rates will not necessarily or even likely reduce dollar income , if the 1965 rate cut is a sound precedent . Though $100 million was whittled from the rate structure in that year , the reduction in rates , including the " after-nine " long distance rates , sent volume of calls soaring and net income rate to an all-time high . call many states will push for a reduction of intrastate rates to reflect the $85 million transfer remains to be seen . Some will undoubtedly follow the lead of Tennessee , where Chairman Atkins announced that he was satisfied with the current structure In any case , it will take considerable time to put any state reductions into effect . The political aspect of the separations procedui c is seen in the willingness of Bell to accept shifts of capital to interstate operations , where because of technological innovations , costs arc becoming dramatically lower . For example , a long distance microwave tower circuit costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open-wire circuit . The capital transfer checks the great reductions possible in long distance rates and , since state regulation bodies are even less effective than the FCC , rates in both Jurisdictions are sustained at high levels . As important as the commission 's actual orders was the progressive position it took on liberalized depreciation for tax purposes and the shifting of the capital structure of AT &T; to a greater per cent of debt capital . While no requirement was exacted of management on these matters , vigorous state commissions will be encouraged to require both in establishing the intrastate rate base Though the midsummer interim decision went further than the stock market had anticipated , and though the Bell petition for reconsideration was draped in black , the prevailing reaction was that the great monopoly 's health was unimpaired . Even The Wall Street Journal found little reason to scold . However , newspaper headlines did invite millions of telephone users to ask themselves how far the cultivated image of the company squared with reality All utilities spend lavishly to build favorable public imales , but few have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with lyric notices about how great and efficient is the telephone company , how devoted to the public service Western Electric emerges as one of the world 's wonders in mastery of technology and leadership in , research . But every advertisement , every leaflet , every good-will contribution , every research project comes out of the pocket of either the subscribers or the taxpayer , the public being compelled to finance the molding ot their own thinking . No study has ever tried to measure this colossus of private socialism  --  which has never cut a dividend payment , not even in 1932 , and which has operated for most of its life under its own synthetic system of law  --  against its public image . But there are reasons to believe that AT &T; managers are perhaps no better than the policy makers in other combines , that its " efficiency " is rooted in monopoly power , technological mysteries and a maze of bookkeeping through which no regulatory body has ever found its way . That the managers do have business feet of clay has lately been revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company has clung to a capital structure of roughly one-third debt and two-thirds equity This ratio is normally reversed in most utilities . When it has been pointed out that a structure of fifty-fifty equity to debt would produce much lower telephone rates at no reduction in earning rate , the officials have always raised the ghost of another 1930 depression and a possible financial disaster for the company . The demand for telephone service is elastic , they contend , and a sudden reduction in public use could be a great threat to a company with a heavy debt . After 1945 , when the company could borrow huge sums at interest rates considerably under 4 per cent , it followed the policy of raising billions in new capital largely by selling stock and convertible debentures that required earning rates of 8 to 10 per cent . Moreover , the $15 billion in new capital raised in recent years came at excessively high cost through the issuance of " rights " to stockholders and the conversion of debentures into stock at below market prices . But now that interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a policy of increasing the debt ratio to 40 per cent , at which point consideration will be given for even more debt if the demand for new capital continues to mount . When asked why they relied mostly on equity capital when interest iates were low , and now are beginning a shift to debt when interest rates are high , AT &T; officials dismissed the question before the FCC as being " twenty-twenty hindsight . " If so , it appears that the electric and gas utilities have enjoyed better foresight than the managers of the world 's largest combine To mold policy according to the experience ot the Great Depression nearly a generation after that event is hardly financial statesmanship To persist in the belief that capital risk in the telephone industry is higher than in any other natural monopoly , or that demand is more elastic , is to close one 's eyes to the vast changes in American life since the era of The Literary Digest , when the number of telephone use 's did shrink to the privileged middle class . The social situation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone is essential for regaining employment , and the lower-middle class assumes that the telephone is a home necessity Bell 's own records show that demand has been remarkably firm on an upward moving line through each shift in the business curve since World War II No corporation in America is less vulnerable than the Bell system to the vagaries of the market . As the only supplier of its major plant needs and sole judge of its rate of replacement , it is practically unaffected by obsolescence , the great bugaboo of the competitive market . The switching equipment in the Nashville office , now two stages behind in technical development and fully depreciated twenty years ago , is still going strong after forty years . Sheer size gives AT &T; an enormous advantage in the money market . Should its demands for equity capital begin to exhaust the interest of the buying public ( it now accounts for 6 per cent of equity value on the stock exchange ) , there remains the great debenture market where its bonds are rated triple A. As a sheltered utility , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When it feels the profit pinch , it can and does appeal to the regulatory bodies , an avenue of relief not open to the average business . Given these facts , company fiscal management appears timid , unimaginative , ultraconservative and overoriented to short-range investor interest . Such conspicuous shortcomings raise questions about the advertised masterminding in the areas of technology which lie outside the field of layman understanding . However , an examination of some of the rate hearings over the years by the few dynamic state commissions makes a strong case for the proposition that AT &T; has made its way in part by bullying the regulatory bodies into letting it overcharge the American consumer . The Bell system entered the post-World War II era with a frontal assault on forty-six jurisdictions for higher rates in connection with its huge expansion of service . The campaign was carefully worked out in New York and waged by the erudite and highly paid legal staff of the parent company . Cases were started simultaneously before the " push-over " commissions  --  the dozen or so that would be satisfied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company . The legal team then moved from state to state where more elaborate presentations , supported by a mass of exhibits , were considered advisable , and where Bell-written decisions were provided for the commissions to release . Since such states were characterized by ineffective regulation , the monopoly was already receiving high returns in them . They thus provided themselves with an ever-mounting body of precedents to urge on the tougher commissions . Such commissions were not the only targets of the grand strategy . It also included state courts , where the judges , themselves unlettered in rate making , would be likely to construe due process of law according to commission precedents established elsewhere . The latter phase of the campaign paid off handsomely in Tennessee , where a country club chancellor overruled the long , painstaking investigation and finding of the state commission and ordered a 20 per cent rate increase . Tennessee 's commission had the reputation in 1947 of being " tough " and was placed far down in the schedule of hearings . The " team " of eleven Bell system lawyers arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitals behind them . The hearings budget for the commission was a paltry $25,000 ? probably less than the retainer fee of a single company lawyer  --  and Commissioner Jourolmon had to restrict research to two 432 or three areas of cost , including inflated investment during the test period and excessive reserves for pensions . The decision ruled that Southern Bell was already earning from 6 to 12 per cent , and was at least not entitled to a raise . The savings to state users amounted to $4 million before court intervention in 1948 . Jourolmon resigned from the commission to serve as special assistant to a number of other states where the " team " also went down to defeat After the famous 1947 round , AT &T; refined its techniques and now pursues them with even greater success . The New York lawyers are kept in the background and local talent makes the formal presentations . Universities , banks and investment houses are tapped for " expert " testimony . However , the data are centrally researched and company presentations appear as letter-perfect as a rehearsed Broadway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sponsored for university personnel , Southern Bell alone having held twenty-six such gatherings in the past dozen years . The only serious setback in the ensuing years was at the hands of the California Commission in 1965 , when Pacific Bell had its rates cut $41.7 million and was required to refund $83 million in overcharges to ratepayers . Since these findings were sustained by the California Supreme Court , the charges of padding the rate base m at least fourteen areas of accounting at the expense of the consumers may be presumed to be valid . And since these involved intrastate cost-accounting procedures employed by all of the associated companies , a list of these is in order . ( 1 ) Speculative Property Held for Future Use . The commission laconically observed that while some acquisitions for future installations are prudent , the company " should not be allowed to speculate in realty at the ratepayers ' expense . " ( 2 ) Excessive Executive Salaries . Evidence showed that while Pacific reduced the number of its employees from 71,926 to 67,522 in a seven-year period , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent and salaries jumped 131 per cent ! For rate purposes the bulk of the salary increase was disallowed . ( 3 ) Padded Wage Expenses . For rate-base purposes , the company " folded back " into its wage costs for the entire year increases given only in the last four or five months . This amounted to $22.5 million more than was actually paid . ( 4 ) Excessive Charges to Pensions and Employee Benefits Funds . By using an accrual basis for its pension system , Pacific was burdening the ratepayer with costs far in excess of actual needs . If Pacific had operated on a pay-as-you-go basis for fifty years , its pensions charges in the rate base would have been 60 per cent less in 1962 than under the accrual basis . ( 5 ) Fees Charged Operating Companies by AT &T.; Since the parent company owns all or almost all the stock of its operating companies , it is able to exact whatever terms it prescribes . One of them is a fee for " general services and licenses " to compensate for advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent , the fee now collected is 1 per cent of operating revenues , THE NATION/October 30 , 1967 subject to increase to 2.5 per cent without prior notice . This levy on Pacific in 1963 was $10.7 million . Why Pacific must look to American for advice and services which it should generate within its own vast corporate structure is a question that needs more exploration ( 6 ) Contributions Counted as Operating Costs . The operating companies impose all contributions on their ratepayers . AT &T; in 1963 requested the FCC to make this standard practice in the prescribed accounting system , but the commission declined . Disallowing nearly a million dollars in gifts to colleges , United Givers Fund and other charities , the California commission advised Pacific that telephone users must be free to give or not , as they see fit , and the company would " not be permitted to be generous with ratepayers ' money " ( 7 ) Lobbying Charged as Cost . Similarly , the commission observed that Pacific was guilty of presumption in proposing " to determine without consent or prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not beneficial to them " ( 8 ) Padded Western Electric Charges . Operating companies are under contract to purchase all equipment from or through Western Electric . Even hand tools and paper are supplied . All salvage , installation and repair work is also done through this wholly owned AT &T; subsidiary . Western sets its own charges , which have reflected a 9.1 per cent profit over a fifty-year period . This is a massive return from a captive market , particularly in the case of a public utility . If 6.5 per cent is considered a fair rate of return , Western Electric has taken from the operating companies between $350 million and $400 million in excess profits since 1916 . These excess charges have gone into the rate base and into depreciation expenses ; the burdens being transferred to the telephone users . The California commission held that Western was entitled for rate purposes to no higher earning rate than that allowed Pacific ( 6.3 per cent ) , and it reduced charges and the rate base accordingly  --  a sum in excess of $20 million . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice of including working cash not supplied by the stockholders in the total claimed for the rate base has been generally practiced by the Bell companies and has met the criticism of several commissions Sources for working cash include employee taxes , reserves for corporation taxes and debenture interest , and advance collections from subscribers . The Florida commission disallowed most of this claim by Southern Bell in 1965 , and the California commission found a gross of 527 6 million of Pacific 's working cash not supplied by investors and therefore ineligible for inclusion in determining the average amount of working cash for the base rate . ( 10 ) Padded Plant Cost . Some of the Bell company practices in ballooning the value of its plants for rate purposes are the inclusion of plant under construction ; year-end instead of average plant in service ; conservative depreciation deductions ( so-called " total-life " method ) ; and refusal to use federally allowed accelerated depreciation for tax purposes . The California commission found a difference of more than $3 million in depreciation expense alone . ( 11 ) Inflationary Tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies ( HE NArtoNIOctober 30 , 1967 to join in a consolidated return , thus freeing AT &T; from the obligation of paying income tax on dividends received from its subsidiaries . By this means intra-corporate profiits of Western are also exempt American acts as agent for the companies in paying the income tax , though the amounts forwarded by each to the holding company are determined on a separate basis . The total collected exceeds the amount due by the amount of the " phantom " tax of Western , this amount being rebated to the operating companies as they purchase plant equipment . However , the Bell accountants mark this refund as " deferred taxes " rather than a reduction on plant cost . Moreover , in the case of the usual state franchise tax , this method of accounting shifts to ratepayers the entire load of the state taxes on the parent company 's operations . Few commissions have followed California 's example in tangling with the giant on this bit of tax legerdemain ( 12 ) High Cost of Equity . Putting into practice the idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bargain in associated company stock by having these companies pay AT &T; for loans with stock priced far below market value Where some stock is privately owned , the individual investor is rewarded on the same terms . Thus the 42,000 stockholders owning 10 per cent of Pacific 's stock enjoy the pre-emptive right to buy stock , selling on the market for $27 a share , at the bargain price of $14.28 when a new offering is made . The ratepayers foot the bill for this windfall ( 13 ) Low Equity Ratio . The California commission found the actual equity-debt ratio of Pacific unfair to consumer interests and established the rate base on a hypothetical sixty-forty ratio , a practice which a number of other commissions have followed . ( 14 ) Accounting Costs . In the early history of utility regulation , commissions were hard put to determine a realistic rate base because of loose accounting by the utilities . Assorted practices included imbedding good-will and franchise values in cost records , substituting reproduction cost for original cost , failing to record plant retirement , capitalizing operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , commissions have been important factors in bringing about better utility cost accounting . Few of them have made a comprehensive examination of the Bell financial structure within their own state , and none have dealt with the combine as a whole . The most extensive investigation in recent years was the two-year study of Pacific by the California commission , which also examined the hearings in the eleven other states . The commission found Pacific 's costs extensively padded and its earnings excessive . As a result , it cut the earnings rate back to 6.3 per cent While original cost has served as a theoretical base for thirty commissions , most of them have in practice allowed for inflationary pressures by various means , such as " attrition " ( excessive wasting away of capital ) , price-level adjustment , " fair value " practices , and failure to allow adequately for future growth of revenue in setting the rate base . The possibility that the FCC hearings might explore all the avenues opened by the California investigation understandably made AT &T; s officials nervous . In this situa-433 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some observers saw an indication of the new strategy in the elevation of an associated company official to executive vice president of AT &T; to direct the drive . The central thesis of the campaign was that AT &T; should have an earnings rate competitive with other corporations and this had to be in the upper range of 7.5 to 8.5 per cent on the total investment . As proof of its future competitive needs in the money market , the company cited the $4.2 billion allotted to plant investment in 1966 . Though this huge cost was actually met out of retained earnings , depreciation and borrowing , the officials stressed the future need to resort to equity financing in huge sums . Higher earnings at once were held to be essential to protect the company 's future market position  --  and , indeed , the economic health of the whole country , since AT &T; accounted for 2 per cent of the gross national product . Under the 1944 Hope Natural Gas doctrine of the Supreme Court , a going-concern rate of 5 to 6.5 per cent is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed toward stamping out the long-established public impression that 6 per cent return is sound . If the rate of return of 7 to 7.5 per cent set in the FCC order was , in the words of Chairman Romnes , " most disappointing , " it appears historically to be reasonably generous . Indeed , it will probably be cited as a precedent against state commissions which hold earnings under a 7 per cent ceiling . Moreover , the FCC order puts no ceiling on equity earnings , which can rival that of the most prosperous competitive business if management resorts to more debt capital . What troubles does the second phase of the FCC hearings hold for AT &T?; The Western Electric enigma is up for examination , and it will be seen whether or not the commission dares to use its indirect powers to determine Western 's " proper " place in the Bell family or to control its profit rate . Its popular reputation as a place of technological wizardry will also be examined . Consider the standard 500-model telephone , which was originally sold for $13.75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independents ) . Western has cut more than $3 from the cost of this mechanical device . Is this attributable primarily to its efficiency and unwillingness to coast on its privileged position , or does it lie largely in its monopoly role , the declining cost basis of production , and the fact that improvements in the unit produced no obsolescence ? Neither the cost of improving the unit nor the reduction in price adversely affected Western 's profit rate . Presumably the matter of research already subsidized by the operating companies being paid for a second time in the price of Western 's products will also be examined by the FCC . A second important part of the upcoming hearings will focus on AT &T's; entry into the competitive areas of communication , particularly the market for records communication , including data transmission , facsimile transmission and mixed voice and data transmission . In addition to these are the profitable TV and Comsat markets and the message telegraph service . At the instance of the Common Carriers Bureau , the corporationwas required to submit in 1965 a study of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost basis , rather than on an incremental cost basis , whereby a new activity is charged with only its additional costs and does not share in the overhead of the whole enterprise The results showed net earnings as follows : message toll telephone 10 per cent , wide area service 10 2 per cent , private line 4 7 per cent , teletypewriter 2.9 per cent , telegraph 1.4 per cent , television .9 per cent , and TELPAK .3 per cent . This data seemed to mean that the toll telephone subscribers were being taxed to subsidize the services of Bell in the competitive areas , with both the public and such competition as Western Union being the victims . Bell contends that the allocated cost basis is unfair , and that five of the seven categories should be evaluated on an incremental cost basis , a concept picked up from theoretical economics . The FCC inquiry has asked whether such a theoretical concept as incremental cost is applicable to a monopoly subject to regulatory policies rooted not only in the cost-earnings concept but also in widely accepted social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examination of the Seven Way Cost Study with concern because it looks to the newer areas of communication for its major growth and profit in the future . The traditional telephone field has grown dramatically since 1945 and still far exceeds the growth rate of the gross national product . However , Bell officials freely predict that telephone service is fast approaching saturation . Thereafter , Bell 's growth would tend to match population and GNP percentages . On the other hand , the newer activities offer dazzling vistas of empire building that would require vast investments of new capital . Until their dreams become reality , the managers prefer to treat these activities as fringe operations set up on an incremental cost basis , an accounting device which to the critics has all of the earmarks of pure subsidization . A fascinating avenue of inquiry would be at what point on the profit scale of monopoly does incremental cost of an activity like data transmission cease to be " incremental " and become " imbedded " ? Clearly the second phase of the hearings could create policy of immense importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but past performances in the regulation field do not raise sanguine hopes . Up to the present , the whole communications industry has had little effective regulation , and one must question whether it is possible to begin now . Most Americans perforce accept the emergence of a private corporate giant as a sharer of government , and trust their fate to the sense of public responsibility which its managers may or may not possess , but over whom in either case they have no effective control . Few can question the caliber of men the Bell system recruits . Those who get to the top are conditioned to believe so implicitly in the way the company sets up its costs and rates that they can not conceive of any other approach to effective telephone operation . Those who doubt do not get to the top . These officials impress one as being not only able but honest and truthful in the normal sense . They embrace , emotionally at least , the new gospel that a business is not to be administered solely by the 434 THE NATION/October 30 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " neither managing men nor managing work . . . he is administering a social system . " That they have also taken good care of the economic health of Bell can not be doubted . The value of its stock has doubled in the past decade . If the recent FCC ruling has reduced its speculative attraction , it remains one of the most solid of the blue-chip combines . In spite of heavy transfer of plant costs from intrastate to interstate base in 1965 , the rate of return on its interstate operations rose to 8.01 per cent in 1966 and stood at 8.56 per cent by the opening of 1967 . The projection of return on the present basis indicates an annual rise of 1.11 per cent for the years ahead . Obviously if such productivity were not funneled off in lower telephone rates by firm regulation , it would make mockery of the whole concept of " public utility " and the theory that a monopoly 's plant is dedicated to the public use . A fundamental error of orthodox economics is the effort to fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As John K. Galbraith points out in his newest book , The New Industrial State , these giants are self-contained social institutions . The AT &T; managers are not capitalists but an association of power men caught up in a highly intricate and vastly impersonal organization aiming at distinctive corporate goals . No corporation has achieved so complete an integration of its managerial class into its corporate structure as has AT &T?so; complete , indeed , that the outsider viewing its managers ' high morale , complete dedication and single-mindedness is tempted to speak of them as " brainwashed . " Because of its massive size and spread and its close integration into the functioning of government and society , the Bell system performs a function of the state and substitutes for state action . In this capacity public serviceshould be the guide ; the incentive to management in such a case must be a job well done and a public service met . The fundamental issue at stake in the current hearing is not the " goodness " or " badness " of AT &T,; either as to structure or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal system of government , and the indifferent regulation of this unitary empire may be attributed in part to the divided responsibility for regulation . Its management is certainly dynamic and able . There may be ground rules for regulation within which the company has voluntarily operated , but as Chairman Henry admitted , " they have never been developed by a public hearing . " Certainly there is no overall policy covering the shape and structure of the communications industry and meaningful rationale of regulation . Probably it will take both Congress and the FCC to supply these . The chief opportunity and responsibility at this time belong to the commission . It is impossible to believe that a democracy will remain content with a regulatory body that does not regulate and a private empire operating under its own prescribed order .
