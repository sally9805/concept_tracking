THE U.S. officer directing Exercise Delawar , General Paul DeWitt Adams , 57 , is reputed to be the roughest , most hard-nosed American commander since General George S. Patton . Subordinates look into his leathery face , freeze before his cold stare and stern lips , dub him " Old Stoneface . " The most combat-experienced commander on active duty , Adams expresses his military credo succinctly . Says he : " The man who creates the most violence in a military situation is the one who will win . " <P> Adams has no time to be anything but succinct . Right now he is Commander in Chief of Strike Command ( CINCSTRIKE ) , the unified command that welds Army combat troops and Air Force airlift and fighter planes into a highly mobile quick-assault force . He is Commander in Chief of U.S. forces in an area covering one-third of the earth 's land surface , including some 70 nations of the Middle East , Africa south of the Sahara , and Southern Asia ( USCINCMEAFSA ) . In his spare time , he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which the Army hopes to prove that it needs a large air unit of its own for quick strikes . Air Force officers claim that the Army is merely trying to steal their troop-carrying and air-support role . <P> " An Open Mind . " The selection of Adams to referee this Army-Air Force dispute testifies to his record of cold objectivity and ruthless fairness . Air Force Vice Chief of Staff General William F. McKee recently leaned across a Pentagon barbershop chair to tell Defense Secretary Robert McNamara that Adams was the best man in either service he could possibly have found to run STRIKE . And Air Force Chief of Staff Curtis LeMay calls Adams " the most objective officer I have ever run across in the Army . He has an open mind . " <P> Adams drives himself and his staff to a frazzle . He works ten-hour days seven days a week . At his headquarters on Tampa 's Mac-Dill Air Force Base , associates can recall seeing him in civvies only twice : once on a golf course , once in his office on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas and New Year 's . <P> One officer was summoned to Adams ' office at 4 p.m. on a Sunday , later caught a rare Adams smile . " Have a nice weekend , " said Adams . " I 'll see you Monday morning . " <P> Genius by Sweat . Even bright junior officers who will not concede that Ad ams is innately smarter than they admit there is no way to keep up with him . Says one : " If genius is 90% sweat , then he is a genius . " <P> By such sweat , Adams has built STRIKE in 21 years into a 225,000-man force that can speedily deploy eight Army divisions and more than 50 TAC air squadrons to any spot in the world . <P> During the 1962 Cuban missile showdown , Adams alerted some 100,000 men , readied 1,000 aircraft for takeoff , moved some 15,000 armored-division troops to staging areas . Nikita Khrushchev got the message .
