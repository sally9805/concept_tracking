txt A $600 " little black box " is helping railroads ease 82.75-an-hour firemen out of locomotive cabs around the country . Not that the firemen are surrendering meekly to the electronic device or giving in gracefully to railroad managements anxious to lay them off . Witness last week 's wildcat strikes on several lines . The walkouts were touched off as railroads began the gradual elimination of thousands of firemen in yard and freight service . In the midst of this battle over " featherbedding , " a hot demand is developing for the Alertor , as the electronic device is called . The railroads see it as another weapon in their argument with the unions over the safety issue of what happens when an engineer is suddenly incapacitated , and there 's no fireman on hand to bring the train to a stop . The Alertor is designed to set the brakes automatically 30 seconds after an engineer is incapacitated . There 's nothing new about " dead-man controls , " of course . But adherents of the Alertor claim it offers advantages over pneumatic controls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brakes when an engineer fails to maintain pressure on a foot pedal or a throttle . Big Orders Placed Vapor Corp . of Chicago sold its first Alertor only about a year ago to the Great Northern Railway . Today , 35 lines have ordered a total of 968 devices . The big bulk of orders has come since Nov. 26 , the date the Federal arbitration board ruled that roads could gradually eliminate most firemen on freight and yard engines . The board said , however , that yard engines must have a " dead-man control " if the firemen were eliminated . Because most switch engines used in rail yards had no dead-man controls , the Alertors thus far have been going into these engines for the most part . But they are beginning to find their way into the cabs of regular freight and passenger trains too . Essentially , the Alertor consists of a box mounted above the windshield in front of the engineer and a system of wires from that box to an antenna inside the leather seat on which the engineer sits . The antenna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cab  --  such as touching the throttle or the sanding valve or getting in and out of his seat . Should he cease to make such normal movements , a buzzer sounds and a red light goes on in 20 seconds . If he does n't respond to this alarm in another 10 seconds , the brakes are applied . " Less Tiring on Engineer " The president of one railroad which has a number of Alertors in operation says : " The thing that appeals to us about the Alertor is that it 's less tiring on the engineer . As long as he keeps moving around , holding the throttle , touching the brake or whatever , the device does n't set off the alarm . On a standard dead-man control he has to keep his foot on the pedal all the time which limits his motion . " And then he makes a disquieting comment : " Also , the new system is n't as easy to gimmick . In the usual system a man can put a weight on the pedal and then move away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack , the train presumably would roll on unchecked . ) In the new system , however , he has to be going through normal motions in the cab or else the alarm is triggered . " Actually , in yard locomotives even after the elimination of the fireman the engineer will not be alone . A brakeman will continue to ride in the cab , and the Alertor will really be just an extra safety precaution . The Alertor is priced at 5420 but by the time it is installed the cost to the railroad runs from $600 up to $900 . Credit for inventing the Alertor goes to four men on the engineering staff of the Atchison , Topeka &; Santa Fe Railway which tested it in 1961 . Last year the inventors extended to Vapor the right to make and market the device in return for royalty payments . The Santa Fe is installing the Alertor on 150 switch engines now in service and has ordered it for 26 new locomotives . Seaboard Air Line Railroad , which has served termination notices on 150 firemen , has 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of six a week . It has ordered 96 units in all . Among other big lines ordering the device are Atlantic 0-last Line , the Chicago , Burlington &; Quincy. the New York Central , the Northern Pacific and Southern Pacific . The railroads ' drive to trim firemen from their rolls is also spurring business for other makers of safety controls . Westinghouse Air Brake Co. , after the arbitration ruling , had " a flurry of interest followed by orders . "
