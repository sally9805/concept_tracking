One of the most famous fictitious pieces of music in all literature is the " Vinteuil theme " described by Marcel Proust in Remembrance of Things Past . Explored and dissected for pages , the theme not only prodded Proust 's memory but also helped preserve the memory of Venezuela-born Composer Reynaldo Hahn . A pampered favorite of Parisian society . Hahn was the man on whom Proust modeled the character of Vinteuil , and at his death in 1947 , Hahn was remembered chiefly for his friendship with Proust . Last week in Munich 's Grtner Theater , Hahn 's little-known operetta , Ciboulette , was drawing delighted crowds - and moving critics to take a new look at the man who was once regarded as a precociously gifted composer . <P> Although Hahn wrote Ciboulette in 1923 , he gave it an air of jaded elegance characteristic of turn-of-the-century Paris . The libretto , by Dramatist Robert de Flers , was kept deliberately naive-building ironic contrasts between text and music . The plot is constructed around a country girl , Ciboulette , who is in love with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Act III , the country girl becomes an actress herself and the count 's eyes are opened to her beauty . <P> In last week 's excellent production , the libretto seemed dated and fussy . The strength of the evening lay in Hahn 's music : iridescent , fresh as a breeze , it sometimes suggested Debussy or Massenet , but never lost its own highly personal charm . Underneath the sophistication , critics found far more real thought than they had ever credited Hahn with before . Said the Sueddeutsche Zeitung : " Behind every note one feels a man with a superb feeling for his time and a handwriting of his very own . " <P> Ironically , at the time that the first volumes of Remembrance of Things Past appeared , Hahn was far better known than his friend Proust . The only son of wealthy parents , he published his first songs at 14. his first opera . L'lle du Rve , at 23 . After that , he alternated between opera and ballet . Hahn met Proust when he was 17 ( Proust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend was living as a semi-recluse in a cork-lined room , Hahn often played the piano for him . Hahn advised the author on the technical passages about music that keep cropping up in Remembrance of Things Past . <P> Composer Hahn at first did not take Novelist Proust very seriously-he regarded his friend as a talented amateur . But somehow . Hahn 's own stature seemed to depend on that amateur 's talent . Last week 's revival suggested that the composer may at last have escaped the pages of Marcel Proust 's book .
