In the past five years , nine Albany newspapermen have been subpoenaed a total of 20 times by the Albany County grand jury . Each time , the jury has shown little interest in finding out about criminal matters that the newsmen have reported . Instead , it has investigated the journalists themselves-their private habits as well as their professional performances . The objective is obviously harassment . " In my 35 years as a newspaperman , " says Gene Robb , publisher of both the morning Times-Union and the afternoon Knickerbocker News , " I have never heard of a comparable situation in the U.S. " <P> <P> The newspapers are scarcely standard crusaders . In the 46 years that crusty old Dan O'Connell has commanded the city 's Democratic machine , the papers had fallen into the habit of ignoring stories critical of him . When Gene Robb , a longtime Hearst executive in Washington , took over the chain 's Times-Union in 1953 , O'Connell had no reason to expect any change . Christened " Mr. Nice Guy U.S.A. " by Albany staffers , Robb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in purchasing the Knickerbocker News from the Gannett chain in 1960 . <P> <P> Indictment &; Acquittal . Robb then turned to the papers ' editorial side . " It was my conclusion , " he says , " that our job should be a reporting job . " The first full job of coverage was on a report by the State Investigation Commission condemning the city 's purchasing practices . Then , in 1961 , Reform Candidate Rev. Robert K. Hudnut ran for mayor against the machine-picked Erastus Corning II . The papers duly reported Hudnut 's charges against the machine : that it had been controlling votes through tax assessments ; that it had been making huge profits in settling tax-delinquency cases . Corning won anyway , but the machine was furious with the papers . The city canceled all legal advertising , worth $150,000 a year , in both papers . Robb explained the reasons to the Hearst home office , got its complete backing . <P> In June 1962 , Knickerbocker News Reporter Edward Swietnicki wrote a front-page story about a Negro post-office clerk who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for multiple head bruises and other injuries . The clerk claimed police had beaten him at the station . The grand jury opened an investigation , but it soon became apparent that the machine-controlled , overwhelmingly Democratic panel was interested only in investigating Reporter Swietnicki . Questioned for hours on end by District Attorney John Garry II , Swietnicki said at one point that he had discussed his story beforehand with his managing editor , Robert Fichenberg . Later , Fichen-berg testified that he did not recall such a discussion . On that ground , Swietnicki was indicted for second-degree perjury-a somewhat recondite and rarely used charge having to do with the changing of testimony on an issue not pertinent to the main inquiry . He was duly tried , but acquitted .
