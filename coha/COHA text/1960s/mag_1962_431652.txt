 | PLAYERS WITH MAGIC @# On a dark and rainy afternoon in Boston some years ago the Braves were losing a game to the Brooklyn Dodgers . It was the bottom half of the fifth inning and as the sky grew darker and the rain increased , the Braves tried everything to make the umpires call off the game before it became official . Finally Connie Ryan , the Braves ' second baseman , came wandering out of the dugout wearing an oversize raincoat and carrying a flashlight . History does not record whether the umpires laughed , but certainly everyone else did . And they laughed the day that Lefty Gomez had to bat against Bobby Feller in the gloom of late afternoon . This was in 1940 when the young Feller was long on speed but short on control . Just before Gomez took his stance at the plate , he reached in his pocket , produced a book of matches and lit one . " Put that out , " ordered the umpire . " It 's not that dark . 1 can see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine too , " said Gomez . " I just want to make sure he can see me . " The Ryan and Gomez stories are part of the lore @#  | of the game and they are told and retold whenever baseball people get together . And yet it is one of the sad facts of baseball that if either of these incidents happened today , the offender would be reprimanded sharply and probably fined by his manager , his club owner or the league president . Individuality is disappearing from the game ; the trend is toward the organization man . There are still a magic few who by the force of their personality or the style of their play manage to stand out from the rest , but their number is dwindling . A Dick Stuart is cautioned by the Pittsburgh front office that he will go a lot further in baseball if he keeps his mouth shut and sticks to hitting . Casey Stengel disagrees . " If you think you 're going to do better just by being serious all the time and never telling any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a little mistaken , " he has said . Stengel can say that and practice it because he is a big name , too big to control . When he sets off sparklers in the dugout , as he did in Chicago two years ago , the umpires and the commissioner 's office can only look the other way and pretend it did n't happen . But let a little man try it and he 's in trouble . In the summer of 1957 , when Bragan was manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates , he was thrown out of a game for arguing a call with the umpires . Bragan withdrew into the dugout but reappeared almost immediately with a small carton of orange soda pop and two straws . " It 's a hot night , " he said , " and as long as we 're going to discuss this thing we might as well be comfortable . " Not only was he fined , but less than a week later he was fired as manager . Ballplayers themselves seem to have less patience with the comedian or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varies from the normal pattern of behavior on the field is immediately branded as either a hot dog , baseball 's special-term for a show-off , or as a flake ? an oddball . Last year when Gene Freese , new to the Cincinnati team , hit his first home run of the season , he jumped and skipped his way around the bases , giving a masterful imitation of Bill Mazeroski 's romp after he hit the home run that beat the Yankees in the 1960 World Series . Freese immediately was stamped as a flake . So was Jackie Brandt of the Baltimore Orioles after he hit a home run and then slid into every base as he ran it out . The umpires and the front office winced , but there were no complaints from the fans . There have been flakes and hot dogs in baseball as long as the game has been played , although they were called by other names , like showboats and hamburgers . One of the early flakes was Germany Schaefer , who once decided that take off , even if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager , once recalled the time he was watching a spectacular blaze and admiring the skill and daring of a fireman high atop a ladder . " I stood there marveling at this man , " Mack recalled , " and then I realized I was watching Waddell . " Dizzy Dean and Lefty Gomez were the quickest route from first to third base was straight across the diamond . There was a day when Schaefer came to bat against Nick Altrock with a runner on first . Schaefer took the first pitch for a strike . Then Altrock threw over to first base to hold the runner close . Schaefer swung and missed the second pitch and threw his bat away in disgust . " That 's only strike two , " the umpire said to him . " The heck it is , " Schaefer said . " I swung at the ball he threw to first . " Rube Waddell was another flake . If he heard the wail of a fire siren he was apt to both as zany ? or flaky ? as they were effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cardinals had to play a game in 110 ? temperature . All the players were complaining about the heat , so Dean Sand his teammate Pepper Martin collected scraps of paper and wood and made a fire in the dugout . Then they wrapped themselves in blankets and squatted in front of the blaze . Gomez was once asked what his chief ambition was . " It 's a crucial game before a packed crowd at Yankee Stadium , " said Gomez . " In the ninth inning the bases are loaded . Our pitcher is be2 3  | ginning to fade and Joe McCarthy calls me to the mound . And then I come roaring out of the bullpen , riding a motorcycle and wearing a full suit of armor . " The words and deeds of players like Schaefer , Waddell , Dean and Gomez are almost alien to baseball today . The organization ballplayer thinks first , last and always of security , in the form of high salaries , profitable endorsements and a lucrative pension plan . He plays it safe , and he has taken much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still some genuine comics in baseball , however . Gil Hodges , so long a Dodger , now a New York Met , is one , although he necessarily must keep his talent carefully hidden . When the Brooklyn Dodgers made a trip to Japan in 1956 for a score of exhibition games , Hodges played left field . Between innings he improvised a pantomime that had the apanese fans roaring . In his act , Hodges would be all things , pitcher , batter , base runner and fielder . It was good entertainment , but the act closed forever when the Dodgers returned home . Hodges felt it would not be proper to continue it in the major leagues , and baseball lost an added attraction . Still the Hodges humor shows through on the field occasionally . Hodges was playing first base in St. Louis a few years ago when Stan Musial came to bat . Musial hit a vicious foul ball just wide of first . In a quick , graceful motion , Hodges moved to his left and came up with the ball . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hodges made a lunging stop . On the third pitch Musial swung and missed and the bat came flying out of his hands toward first base . Hodges swooped in on the bat , scooped it up and for an instant pretended that he was about to throw it toward third . Then he turned , his face as solemn as ever , and handed the bat to the bat boy . 24 @#  | Until he retired last year , Ted Williams was hands down baseball 's most magical personality , the surest box office draw in the game . Red Sox attendance without Williams last year was off 280 , - 000 at home and another 130,000 on the ad , this in spite of an expanded schedule the Mares-Mantle home run derby and an improved Red Sox team . It is no secret that the Washington Senators had attendance in mind when they traded for Jimmy Piersall . Washington needed someone who would draw the crowds at home and away . When tickets went on sale for Washington 's opener this year , more than 44,000 were sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a.m. , four and a half hours before the ticket windows opened . This may have been due in part to Washington 's new stadium , but Piersall was the big reason . Two things made Piersall one of the game 's most exciting players and hence , big box office . His demonstrations ? the bug sprays , tirades at umpires and sportswriters , helmet slinging ? are well known . What is sometimes overlooked is that Piersall is also a very accomplished player , a player without any pronounced weakness . He can bunt , hit a home run , hook slide and make a catch . He performs with a gusto that borders on the hysterical and the fans love it . The fans love Rocky Colavito of Detroit , too . Detroit officials estimate that Colavito adds about 1,500 people ? many of them giggly young girls ? to every game 's attendance . Part of the magic of Colavito is his dark handsome face , and part of it is his swing and the ritual leading up to it . Before Colavito steps into the batter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bat and brings it over his head and down behind him , arching his shoulders violently in the process . Rocky calls this loosening his shoulder muscles ; others call it hot-dogging . What does it matter ? It is good theater . The show continues as Colavito steps into the batter 's box . Slowly and @#  | deliberately he swings his bat forward until it is pointed menacingly at the pitcher . He keeps it there for a full second , then draws it back and is ready to swing . The swing is the piece de resistance . When Rocky swings , he comes up from the heels and spins all the way around . There is vengeance in the swing and the fans realize it , so that even when he strikes out , it is exciting . And when he hits a home run , glory be . There are better players than Rocky Colavito ? Al Kaline , his teammate , is one ? hut it 's Rocky who draws the fans . @# Just as Colavito can be accused of being a hot dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aparicio ( ste cover ) and Maury Wills are almost identical in their ability to play shortstop and steal bases . Yet Aparicio is electric , while Wills is merely a pleasant , seriousminded young man . Luis ' flash sterns from his uninhibited joy as he makes the play . He 's a happy guy and he has perfect confidence in his own skill . He handles his hands with a little extra fillip , not so much for show as for the pleasure it gives him . There is a lot of hot dog in Roberto Clemente of the Pittsburgh Pirates . Clemente likes to turn loose his howitzer throwing arm whenever possible , even when the base runner would n't dream of advancing . It always draws oohs and ahs from the crowd . Clemente also has a habit of swinging wildly at bad pitches , missing , and propelling himself completely around and onto the seat of his pants . His base running and slides are conducted with the same abandon . But Clemente is a very good ballplayer and he is the best gate attraction at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball fan wants each play et to be different from any other , each to have his own little eccentricities . He knows that when Vic Power takes throe s at first base on the run he is showing off , but the fan looks forward to it and would be disappointed if Power suddenly started to field in the conventional way . There would be disappointment , too , if Willie Mays abandoned his basket catch , stopped running out from under his cap and stopped playing pepper games with schoolboy delight . And how much duller the game would be if @# @#  | Casey Stengel made himself understood . The fan is always ready ? in fact , eager ? for new personalities in baseball . San Francisco had Mays and Orlando Cepeda when Willie McCovey broke in , but for several weeks McCovey was the only man in town . McCovey has slipped back now , but his name still causes a stir . In San Jose , citizens petitioned to change the name of McCovey Street to Monte Vista Drive . ( " What did this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e petition was denied but a local uncilman said , " If McCovey does n't have a good season , the name goes ! " The Yankees were the Yankees ? Mantle , Berra , Ford , etc. ? when Ryne Duren blazed upon the scene . Duren , good as he was , might have been lost mong a team with such stars as the Yankees , but he knew how to give the ns a good show . First he would vault bullpen railing with one hand to let the crowd know it was the mighty Duren who was coming in . Then ? and e fans came to count on this ? he would fire his first warmup pitch high above the catcher and all the way to the screen . Then he would strike out the batter , at least most of the time . Duren 's meteor , like McCovey 's , has burned out , but he proved that there is always room for a personality . Each new season seems to produce a few players with that intangible touch of magic that makes people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have learned to root for Willie Davis to hit one not over the fence but between the outfielders so they can see him streak around the bases like a frightened fawn . The same fans were surprised and delighted when in the Dodgers ' third game of the season , a young pitcher named Pete Richert came in from the bullpen and struck out six batters in a row . Now they are not too sorry when a Dodger starter is knocked out ; it means that ? Richert may be coming in . Baltimore fans root for a flashy newcomer named John ( Boog ) Powell to hit a home run ; opponents root for someone to hit a line drive to Powell in left field just to see how he butchers it . In either case , it 's exciting baseball . Baseball needs these new personalities , the more , the better . But it could also use a few young players with the imagination and the nerve to come roaring in from the bullpen on a motorcycle , wearing a full suit of armor . END  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
