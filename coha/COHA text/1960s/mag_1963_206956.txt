Obsessed with cold reason , nimble wit and ferocious examinations , French education is a series of sieves that let pass an ever smaller number of ever brighter students . The final screening is France 's finest filter : the apex academies called the grandes coles . <P> Their graduates virtually run France . In fields from art to war , these schools provide the professional training that certifies a Frenchman for the upper ranks of science , industry and the grand corps of key officials who have quietly governed France amid the constant crash of cabinets . Without such training , it is hard to rise-a French Henry Ford is almost inconceivable . France has more than a dozen grandes coles , but the most famous and the most important are the Ecole Normale Suprieure , tops for teachers ; the Ecole Polytechnique , tops for engineers ; and the Ecole Nationale d'Administration , tops for civil servants . <P> Literate Civil Service . All in Paris and all state-run , the three schools last year admitted a mere 458 students . Getting in requires far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50% of candidates who pass those stiff exams , a handful of the very brightest stay on at a lyce ( secondary school ) for two more years of study before tackling the even stiffer exams for grandes coles . <P> Of the three main schools , the one that gave the prewar grand corps its literary flavor is the two-year Ecole Normale Suprieure . A stone 's throw from the Panthon , it was created by the French Revolution in 1794 to " teach morals and shape the hearts of young republicans for the practice of private and public virtue . " Each year the school accepts about 80 men out of more than 600 candidates . The goal of normaliens , who study either science or literature , is not only a university degree but also the diploma called I'agrgation , passport to France 's top teaching jobs . In return for a free education , normaliens teach in a university for at least five years . <P> Famed normaliens include Henri Bergson , Louis Pasteur , Jules Romains and Jean-Paul Sartre . Before World War II , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even now , De Gaulle 's Premier is Normalien Georges Pompidou , a banker-professor who writes books on French writers from Racine to Malraux . Yet he is not typical : in the Fifth Republic , normaliens have lost political influence . <P> Science &; Glory . More important than ever are alumni of the Ecole Polytechnique , another creation of the Revolution near the Panthon , which maintains the military air given it by Napoleon ( motto : " For fatherland , science and glory . " ) . Commanded by a general , and obliged to serve for six years in the armed forces , the school 's 600 students observe strict military discipline , wear cocked hats and swords on parade . A.W.O.L. students get a highly deterrent punishment-loss of the right to take an exam .
