RECENTLY several critics have suggested that the time has come for the novel to give way to some other kind of literature . Just what this new kind of literature would he they do not seem to know with much certainty ? presumably some kind of blend of fact and imaginative interpretation ( Rebecca West 's studies of treason have been cited as an example ) . Meanwhile the novelist himself , at least in his more despairing moments , must often wonder if the time has n't come for him to throw in the towel . He faces a society so complex and with so little sense of community that he falters before the task of reducing it to any sort of manageable proportions . The envy that American novelists have always felt of the neat and orderly worlds of a Jane Austen or an Anthony Trollope grows increasingly acute ; and as other societies , in England and Western Europe , become more like American society , the envy spreads to include their novelists . At the same time , the territory that the novelist can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His role as an interpreter of society is increasingly undercut by popular sociology , and his role as interpreter of the inner life of man is increasingly undercut by popular psychology . This change is reflected in the kind of catch-phrases we use in conversation . Where a few decades ago we were likely to adorn our talk with references to literary figures we are now more likely to use the convenient abstractions of sociology or psychology ; instead of calling a certain kind of man that we do n't like a Babbitt we will probably call him an organization man or an other-directed personality or a conformist . Yet in spite of all this , and in spite of such facts as that fiction commands a smaller proportion of the book buyer 's dollars than it used to , that the amount of space given to fiction in most periodicals is being constantly reduced , and that literature of all kinds is losing the pre-eminence among the arts that it enjoyed in the nineteenth century and for a while thereafter ? in spite of all this , novels continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them achieve publi. 1 ? would regard as absolutely necessary for the survival of the art . The prestige of the novel has not declined nearly so much as deploring critics and self-pitying writers would have us believe . Indeed a great many subjects are treated fictionally when in fact they might better be presented as essays or memoirs or even as nothing at all . TALES OF THE SEA AROUND VS EUGENE BURDICK is an example of a writer whose work straddles fiction and nonfiction . His first book , The Ninth Wave , was a highly successful but undistinguished novel about California politics ; probably it would have been a better book , though certainly less of a commercial success , if it had been presented as straightforward political science . Burdick 's next book , written in collaboration with William T. Lederer , was The Ugly American , a thinly fictionalized criticism of American diplomats in Asia . Whatever importance it has is entirely political rather than literary , but it is one of the few novels of recent years that have successfully competed with popular sociology and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though ironically enough a good many people who have n't read the book use the phrase " ugly American " to mean someone who does a poor job of representing America abroad , contrary to the book 's portrayal . In his new book , The Blue of Capricorn ( Houghton Mifflin , $4.95 ) , Burdick frankly mixes fiction and non-fiction . The subject is the Pacific Ocean , and of the eighteen chapters thirteen are essays on one or another of the ocean 's aspects ? its currents , its birds , its clouds , its underwater life , its ethnic groups , its conflicts of culture between accustomed methods of doing things and the new ways introduced by the white man ( especially by the soldiers stationed in the Pacific during the second world war ) , the contrast between Asian and Pacific island cultures , etc . Scattered among these essays are five more or less fictionalized episodes , ranging from an account of what must have happened to the ninety-eight Americans left behind on Wake Island after 110 THE NEW BOOKS only when the historical record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as the reader can tell , purely imaginative . Oddly enough , despite Burdick 's enormous enthusiasm for the Pacific , the best of his stories concern characters who dislike it ? one is about a Frenchman who first goes to a Pacific island to escape the falsity of French life but who ends up alleviating his otherwise overwhelming boredom by making minute studies of the Local culture , valueless though he finds it : and the other is about a wealthy Midwestern Jewish girl who marries into an island family and is appalled by the life she finds there . So The Blue of Capricorn is a kind of mixture of Rachel Carson and James Michener . The nonfiction chapters are much the better part of the book , and though they are not a match for Miss Carson in beauty of expression or elegance of observation , they are very much worth reading . SCUM AND DREGS COLIN WILSON is the young Englishman who a few years ago at some improbably early age produced a volume of criticism called The Outsider . The book was received in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sinai and in this country as if it were the literary equivalent of Typhoid Mary . ( Both estimates were excessive . ) After a couple of other hooks Wilson has now written a novel called Adrift in Soho ( Houghton Mifflin : , $3.50 ) , a modest little account of a young fellow named Harry who leaves Birmingham for London in search of a more exciting life . Harry meets a variety of spongers and drifters and would.be artists , then a painter who is the Real Thing , and the inevitable girl who seems to he part of the city 's cesspools but who underneath it all is as unconquerably bourgeois as our hero from Birmingham . This is a novel that might better have been presented as an essay . What Wilson is trying to do in the book essentially is to distinguish between the authentic and the inauthentic outsider ? between those who separate themselves from conventional society because they have something more important to do than to obey its dictates , and those who separate themselves from conventional society because they are n't up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time ago when he distinguished between the scum , which rises above the mass , and the dregs , which sink to the bottom , though most people lump both together as equally undesirable . ) Wilson has n't much gift for characterization , and the long passages he devotes to the dreg-outsiders are fairly tiresome . After a hundred pages or more of description of run-of-the-mill bohemian life he frankly confesses that it is a " bore , " that " the Soho bum possesses none of the alertness and enterprise you might expect : the only characteristics the vagrant life develops arereader has independently reached this conclusion long before Wilson states it . Colin Wilson is at his best and liveliest when he temporarily abandons his story to comment on human nature or other subjects in a generalizing , speculative way . He has an interesting mind , but it is probably not a mind that will ever find its best expression in fiction . THE OTHER WILSON THIS Wilson is not of course to be confused with another English writer and critic with the same surname @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a considerably more gifted novelist . The remarkable thing about Angus Wilson 's novels is their variety ; of the four he has so far published ? Hemlock and After , Anglo-Saxon Attitudes , The Middle Age of Mrs. Eliot , and the new one , The Old Men at the Zoo ( Viking , 54,50 ) ? no two are much alike ; in fact , admirers of any one book often find the others unbearable , and when Wilson 's name comes up among readers of fiction the common querulous inquiry is why does he refuse to write another book like such-and-such of his earlier novels , usually Anglo-Saxon Attitudes . Well , The Old Men at the Zoo is another study of Anglo-Saxon attitudes , but it does n't greatly resemble the novel that goes by that name . It is set in the future ( the 1970s ) , and concerns the struggle for power among a group of men for control of the London Zoological Gardens . This struggle goes beyond the zoo itself to become involved in national politics , as the president of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses the evacuation of the zoo to his own estate to build up a war scare that he hopes will bring him hack to political power ; it even becomes involved in international politics when the zoo is largely destroyed and England is ( temporarily ) devastated by a war conducted from the Continent by a nen-Fascist coalition . But beneath the surface struggle for power , the interplay of conscience and force , the contest between those who wish to serve the zoo because they love it and those who wish to exploit it for their own purposes , the book seems to be a kind of allegory . The vast variety of animals in the zoo 's possession represents the instinctual life ; Wilson ( as I read him , at least ) sees man as part of an enormously complex and interrelated animal creation that is not only fascinating intellectually but in some sense holy . Therefore the attitude a man takes toward the rest of animal creation is essentially the attitude he takes toward his own instinctual nature , and the instinctual nature of other men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or destroy it , but whatever he does he is defining his own character . Wilson is wonderfully skillful at inventing and presenting a variety of characters to embody cals in the public library ( and appropriating what she reads in hilariously peculiar ways ) , accumulating junk in her two filthy rooms , and generally doing as she pleases . By her own standards Mrs. Ross 's life is crowded and dramatic , though to anybody else she would seem pitiably forlorn and isolated . Then by means that it would be unfair to reveal , Mrs. Ross actually does come into possession of a considerable sum of money , and her little world , which , for all its strangeness , has given her an identity and a ' ) lace to live , is destroyed . The novel has one fault which so far as I can see was unavoidable . After the collapse of Mrs. Ross 's world the network of social-service agencies that takes her over succeeds in locating her husband , who had deserted her years before , and reunites them temporarily . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , and though Nicol-son does a fine job of portraying him ( he is a real bum , utterly amoral ; in contrast to his wife he is a crafty rather than an innocent milker of the welfare state ) , his characterization lacks the brilliance that Nicol-son brings to play upon Mrs. Ross 's mad world , The IVhisperers is certainly a slight work , but it is thoroughly novelistic , in the sense that what it has to say could be said in no other form than the novel , Unlike many of the works here reviewed , it is a genuine product of the sympathetic imagination . THEME AND VARIATIONS T H E Canadian novelist Morley Callaghan has been so thoroughly rediscovered and so highly praised by Edmund Wilson , Alfred Kazin , and several other critics of eminence that his new hook , A Passion in Rome ( Coward , McCann , $4.95 ) , is certain to receive a good deal of attention , especially from readers who like me are familiar with very little of Callaghan 's earlier work . Unfortunately the story employs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiction : an American ( in this case a Canadian ) arrives in Italy with a general feeling of emptiness. tie is alienated from his family at home , has no close friends , makes a living at his job but does not find it other wise very rewarding . Then he dis covers a beautiful Italian girl , fan in love with her , and amidst th , timeless beauty and subtle civiliza tion of Italy she restores him to life This story , with either a soldier of a civilian in the male role and witl anything from a peasant earth-god dess to a movie star in the femah role , has been written so many time in the last fifteen years that , if al the versions were filmed , Gina Lol lobrigida , Sophia Loren , and all rea sonably accurate facsimiles there ? . would be fully employed to the age of ninety-five . But this is unfair to Callaghan . HE employs the clich ? , true , but ht brings to it a certain amount of in ventiveness and originality , and a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with whom the hero falls in love in A Pas sion in Rome is actually from a squalid New Jersey background . though of Italian descent . She has had a very successful career in the United States as a singer in night clubs and on television until some kind of nervous breakdown made her lose her nerve ; now she is imprisoned by alcoholism , by her lover ( an aging motion-picture director with no fu. tore ) , and by her dream of herself as a Roman lady . Consequently , the hero must first free the heroine from her sundry ser vitudes before she can in turn free him to live his life more fully than he has in the past . This is obviously a good deal more complicated than the usual versions of the story , and a good deal more worth reading , but there remains a question whether Callaghan has really broken the stereotype or merely camouflaged it with ornamentation . A reader 's final judgment will depend on how convincing and how profound he finds the relation between the man and woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff novels are made out of than the stuff life is made out of , though Messrs . Wilson , Kazin , et al . may be able to find virtues in the hook that escape me HOME TALENT N OW for some novels by Americans . First , Dangerfield by Burnaby Conrad ( Harper , $3.95 ) , is one of those hooks referred to earlier which might more appropriately have appeared as a memoir than as a novel . The main character , the Dangerfield of the title , is obviously Sinclair Lewis , and as a portrait of Lewis in his last unhappy years , when his reputation was slipping and his relations with other people deteriorating , it is a brilliant job . For some reason Conrad has moved the scene of the novel from Williamstown to Santa Barbara , but many details correspond precisely to Lewis ' Williamstown house ? the white carpet in the living-room. the upstairs workroom , the geographical relation between the house and the swimming pool , even the picture window , though it actually looked out on the Berkshires rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the portrait of Dangerfield-Lewis concerns a love affair between the aging novelist 's young mistress and his son , whom he is trying to get to know after long estrangement . This is jerrybuilt , and perhaps the whole hook would fail to interest anyone who did recognize Lewis in the main character , but that character certainly carries conviction , Furthermore Conrad is to be congratulated on having at last written a book that does not once use the word matador . I N False Entry ( Little , Brown , $5 ) Hortense Calisher has written a much more complex and subtle sort of book . The main character ( who is also the narrator ) never reveals his true name , but he comes to call himself Pierre Goodman and that is the way he will have to be referred to here . For some reason . which Miss Calisher never tries wholly to explain , Pierre is one of those people whose natures seem to demand that they live vicariously , through their ability to make a false entry into the lives of others and to assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is partly accounted for by the circumstances of his birth ; though actually the posthumous son of a worthless soldier and a seamstress , he is born in a great house in London where his mother is employed , the house of a rich Jewish family named Goodman , whose name Pierre later appropriates him kindly , almost as if he were or of their own children , and so at very outset of his life he is placed i a false position . Later Pierre and his mother joi relatives in the Southern Unite States , and here again Pierre ente falsely into the life of the tows Though his relatives are only r spectable working-class peopl Pierre , with his natural intelligenc ? his English accent and manners , b. comes a kind of pet of an aristocrati old lady and a learned schoolmaste who between them prepare him fc a future quite different from what h might have reasonably expected .

In adult life Pierre continues hi role-playing , until finally he is caugh in a situation where he is found on through his failure to know one err cial fact about a situation that h has entered falsely , and he at las must make a true entry into the lit of another person . Miss Calisher writes a leisurely ruminative prose , full of generaliza Lion and speculation , shot throng ! with intelligence and perception , oc casionallv so fine-spun that the mean ing escapes me , hut often keen am original . It strikes me as somehov a feminine kind of writing and no entirely appropriate to a masculine narrator .

I am not always certain of what Miss Calisher is up to , and I am by nc means convinced that the whole thing is a success . But there is an unavoidable impressiveness about the book ; it has a tone and a quality of its own ; it bears the mark of singularity , of an effort to do something significant and to do it in its A New Life by Bernard Malamud ( Farrar , Straus &; Cudahy , $4.95 ) is something of a disappointment , not only because of Malannul 's generous endowment as a writer but also because in this book he starts with what seems like a fine subject for a novel and essentially wastes its opportunities . The main character in .4 New Life is one S. Levin , a New York Jew with a sordid past behind him ( his father was a thief , his mother a suicide , and he himself has only recently recovered from a bad bout of alcoholism ) . On the strength of a newly acquired master 's degree he lands a job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere in the Far West , probably in Oregon , and there he arrives with a tiny wardrobe , a sizable beard , and an enormous conviction that the teaching of literature is the noblest of callings . The impact that so outlandish a man would make on a complacent conventional college community should he fascinating to read about , but in fact Malamud devotes most of It Is novel to commonplace faculty politics and adultery ? intrigues in which Levin plays an important role , to be sure , but a role hardly different from the one he would have played if he had been an Anglo-Saxon from Evanston with a father in real estate . Levin 's Jewishness ( in a community where Jews are rare ) causes little comment and hardly affects the direction of the story ; his fight for the liberal arts in a technical college never rises above the kind of pious utterance on the subject that a college dean can produce in any length desired on ceremonial occasions . Levin 's tendency to rummage through other people 's desks and to make blackmailing use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his creator as morally reprehensible , but it is not easy to square with Levin 's presumed moral awareness . A New Life is not a poor book or a dull one but it is wasteful , and for any reader who enjoys in a novelist the ability to make the most of a situation it will be disappointing . Night Song ( Farrar , Straus , &; Cudahy , $3.50 ) , a first novel by a young Negro writer named John A. Wil " deleted material and published in France , where it ( inevitably ) won a prize ; now it has been translated by the author into his native language . But do not suppose that the American Samuel Beckett has at last appeared . Scarred is a very slight little autobiographical novel . The main character is an American boy with a harelip who lives in a small Western American town . The opening sections deal with his repeated and ineffectual efforts to persuade God through prayer to eradicate the scar on his lip , and his resulting religious doubts ; these sections are no better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " creative writing " courses in colleges all over the country . The later part of the hook concerns the scarred boy 's theft of stamps from the one other boy who has befriended him ; this situation is a good deal subtler and more penetrating . Neither boy understands his own actions and emotions ; both are trapped in painful and apparently insoluble positions , isolated by guilt and suspicion when they need each other most . There is at least the material for a good short story here , but hardly enough to sustain a novel . Rosalie Packard , author of Love in Question ( Houghton Mifflin , $3.50 ) : is an American by birth who now lives in England . Her heroine , Sara Finch , is the daughter of a famous beauty by the first of her many mar. riages , and of a father who is seldom home and takes little interest in het when she is there .
