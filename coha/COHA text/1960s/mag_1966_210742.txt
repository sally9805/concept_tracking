THE PRESIDENCY <P> After a long Fourth of July weekend on the Texas ranch , Lady Bird Johnson was rarin ' to return to Washington and dive back into the elaborate prepara tions for Luci 's Aug. 6 wedding . But Lyndon Johnson was in his natural hab itat and , in the absence of any pressing business , had no intention whatever of rushing away . Said he to Lady Bird : " The Cabinet 's gone . Congress is home . You and I and Bill Moyers would be there all alone . " So the visit was ex tended for the rest of the week - a week in which Johnson buckled one swash after another . <P> A National Asset . The President covets his precious hours along the Pedernales the way a miser covets gold . Because of their effect on him , the 438 sun-baked acres of the L.B.J. ranch may be as much a national asset during the Johnson presidency as all the vaults in Fort Knox . To some 75 reporters attending a ranch barbecue - and John son 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President just did not seem the same man who had walked out of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue five days before . <P> Tanned to a healthy leather brown , more affable than he had been in ages , Johnson strolled serenely among the gaily covered tables spread out on the thick Bermuda and St. Augustine grass in front of the ranch house , chatting , sniffing the air , shaking hands , sitting to gobble up a hefty plate of barbecue himself . Muzak wafted with the river breeze through the live oaks , and news men sipped the local Pearl beer and soft drinks . <P> At the outdoor press conference , Viet Nam was the major topic , and the recent progress of the war clearly had helped the President 's mood . Still , as the nation 's most avid psephologist , * Johnson took every opportunity to discount his recent drop in the polls . Without even looking down at his notes , he rattled off nearly a dozen favorable tallies and , with a brief flash of his White House petulance , threw a barb at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess , in the last week . You do n't read about the favorable ones , though , I observe . " Quoting a poll that gave him the approval of 55% of the nation , Johnson added : " That is what you reported as a landslide during General Eisenhower 's period . " <P> " Here Comes Linton . " The President was not to be outdistanced on another front . Largely forsaking his air-conditioned Lincoln Continental for the water , he has taken to spending his time at the helm of his 19-ft. , 60-m.p.h. fiberglass speedboat . Particularly toward evening , when the air cools and the water stills , the President takes to 22-mile-long Lake Lyndon B. Johnson , often searching out a secluded cove where he and his party can have privacy from peering eyes . Clamping down his yellow golfer 's cap , clenching the wheel like a vise , Johnson really opens up the throttle , leaving broad wakes and gaping mouths behind him . He goes so fast , in fact , that the Secret Service has had to buy two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at full throttle ( four boats in all accompany him ) . " Here comes Linton " ( hill-country pronunciation of the President 's name ) , chuckle the fishermen as the armada approaches , or-if they happen to have blinked- " There goes Linton . "
