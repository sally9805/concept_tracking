" <P> That cryptic advertising message divides the Now Generation , steeped in arcane automotive lore , from the majority of Americans , who still regard autos as something to trundle them to the supermarket or station and to be used for occasional longer trips . As the initiate knows , the Mach I is neither spaceship nor sound barrier . It is a hyped-up Mustang-one of Ford 's fast-moving contenders in what Detroit calls " the muscle-car " market , where the best sales pitch is neck-snapping acceleration . The new Mach I , which can be ordered with an engine of up to 335 h.p. , already accounts for 22% of all Mustangs sold .

It is a popular achievement . The modern counterpart of the pool shark is a kid in a hopped-up car , cruising the hamburger joints along New Jersey 's U.S. 1 or the Strip in Beverly Hills , looking for a competitor with whom he can drag race for money . For most buyers , however , the appeal is only psychological : few ever utilize the full potential of their machines . The kick they want is a sense of power and a feeling of youthfulness.
