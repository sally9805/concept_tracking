At 5 o'clock one morning last week , Common Market Commission President Walter Hallstein , unshaven and wearily ebullient , emerged from a meeting in Brussels to announce " the most important step in the history of the building of the community . " With only a few loose ends left lying around , the Common Market had finally finished the work of creating a unified farm economy for its six member nations . <P> The meeting not only settled the biggest outstanding problem among the Six , but it also removed the most important obstacle to the significant Kennedy Round talks at Geneva , which are supposed to negotiate worldwide across-the-board tariff cuts . These tariff conferences could not begin until the Common Market countries settled their own farm policies . <P> Boycotted . It took five years of hectic negotiations to create Eurofarm . Just last year , when the French boycotted the Common Market for seven months over the issue of farm financing , it looked as if the whole European Community might fall apart . It was largely a struggle between farm-efficient France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its farmers , and factory-efficient Germany , which wanted to protect its uneconomical , small-scale agriculture . As was in evitable if agreement was to be reached at all , last week 's pact was a compromise . It fixed the prices to be paid throughout the Common Market for beef , sugar , milk , rice , olive oil and fruits and vegetables . The prices are higher than those now paid in the relatively efficient farming countries of the Six , France , Belgium , The Netherlands and Luxembourg , and lower than those in Germany and Italy . For instance , the minimum price for sugar beets will be set at $17 a ton , which is 42% higher than the current French price - but 6.6% lower than the German price . <P> Penalized . The immediate effect will be to raise consumer prices in most Common Market countries - although , paradoxically , the underlying aim is to increase output and lower prices . Under the agreement , subsidies are supposed to encourage efficient producers and penalize less efficient producers , so that prices ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect is bound to be inflationary , and French Foreign Minister Maurice Couve de Murville complained : " One can not pretend that , from the economic standpoint , what we have done is entirely defensible . " <P> In May , in another marathon session ending at 5 a.m. , the Common Market had agreed on a financing system for price supports and export subsidies-of which France will collect about 45% - and for modernizing farming , which will benefit Italy the most . These and other agreements virtually complete the creation of what the French call Europe verte ( a green Europe ) , which will formally sprout on July 1 , 1968 , the date when the last industrial tariffs among the Six are also scheduled to disappear .
