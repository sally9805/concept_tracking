Fawn-colored pants , white shoes , a pink satin shirt with ELVIS embroidered on the back and a small Presley hat decorated with the hero 's picture-all these festooned a fat , balding , cigar-smoking man in a four-room executive suite on the Paramount lot in Hollywood . Thomas Andrew ( " Colonel " ) Parker , 49 , is the discoverer , manager and part owner of Elvis Presley ; although he tries very hard to look every inch a rube , he is known on all horizons of show business as the shrewdest pitchman who ever came out of a small-time carny into the big time . <P> Although he has a sizable cut of Presley 's estimated $2,000,000 a year income , Parker still clings to his carny ways . Once when Elvis appeared at Dallas ' Cotton Bowl , Hollywood friends found Manager Parker near the main gate , selling Presley-autographed photos . His explanation : " Do n't you ever get so big you wo n't sell pictures . " He has sold other things , too , at Presley performances . Bucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seldom passes out freebees even to close business associates , has been known to peddle war-surplus binoculars ( at $2 a pair ) to buddies who ended up in poor locations . <P> Cash in Advance . With Elvis just discharged from the Army and hotter than a radioactive yam-his new record , Stuck on You , is boiling with sales , and shooting began last week on his new movie , G.I. Blues-Parker is busier than ever filling out deposit slips . This week on ABC-TV , Frank Sinatra and his fellow clansmen are welcoming Elvis home-and the gesture is costing Frankie $125,000 . This time the Colonel will accept a check , but he usually prefers cash-in advance . Las Vegas ' gaudy New Frontier once pleaded that its check was as good as anyone 's . " No check is good , " replied the Colonel , his eyes soft as ball bearings . " Some are pretty good , but they got an atom-bomb testing place out there in the desert . What if some feller pressed the wrong button ? " <P> Presley depends completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel nods , is content to look after the hips while the man he calls Admiral looks after the Presley legend . Meanwhile , a legend is growing around Parker himself that might very well reduce P. T. Barnum to the size of Tom Thumb . <P> Empty Franks . The least surprising fact of Tom Parker 's life is that it began in a traveling carnival which his parents worked . Orphaned as a child , he worked for his uncle 's Great Parker Pony Circus , had his own pony-and-monkey act when he was in his teens . Barker , merry-go-round operator , candied-apple dipper , ice shaver for snow cones and general man-about-the-midway , he once took a job as a dogcatcher in Tampa , Fla. , where he gave away hundreds of puppies to kids . <P> During the ' 30s , running a frankfurter concession , Parker beat the foot-long hot-dog fad by using foot-long buns , sticking a bit of frank into each end , and filling up the middle with onions . When the suckers howled , he pointed to little chunks of hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You dropped your meat , son , now just move along . " Later , as a carny pressagent , he got interested in singers , profitably managed Gene Austin , Hank Snow and Eddie Arnold before he found the boy with the coin in the groin .
