txt A foreign aid cut of $1,124,400 , - 1.000 was sent to the House of Representatives today by its Appropriations Committee . Except for restoring $300 , - 000.000 of a $500,000,000 cut in military aid , the committee adopted all the reductions voted yesterday by its subcommittee . It also adopted a critical report by Representative Otto E. Passman , Democrat of Louisiana , the subcommittee chairman . President Kennedy had requested the $4,752,000,000 authorized by the House and the Senate two months ago . That included $1,500,000,000 in military aid and about $3,200,000 , - 000 in economic loans and grants to underdeveloped countries  --  and others that were spending more than they could afford in resisting Communist sul ) version . S ( ps Policy Repudiated Aid officials were stunned by the size of the cuts . A spokesman for the Agency for International Development said that a recommended 15 per cent reduction in funds for running the agency would necessitate the dismissal of nearly 1,000 employes here and overseas . He declared that the $475,000 , - 000 cut in the $1,250,000.000 requested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy set by Congress a year ago and renewed in July . That policy called for development loans in the next five years at $1,600 , - 000,000 a ' ear . The committee went beyond the actual money cuts recommended by the Passman group . It also tied the President 's hands on the question of future aid to Yugoslavia , Poland or other Communist countries trying to increase their independence of the Soviet Union . Fight in Prospect Both houses voted two months ago , in the authorizing legislation , to leave such aid to the President 's discretion . However . the measure now forbids the use of funds to benefit any country " whose government is based upon that theory of government known as Communism . " Such a limitation would restrict aid to Yugoslavia and Poland to surplus agricultural products . An effort will be made on the floor to throw out the provision on the ground that it constitutes legislation in an appropriation bill , contrary to the rules of the House . W. Averell Harriman , Assistant Secretary of State . warned that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worse setback for the United States in the 15-year fight against Communism . " CommEnting by telephone from Syracuse , N.Y . the former Mutual Security administrator and Marshall Plan envoy to Europe went on : " This is utterly unrealistic . It would take away our most valuable weapons for winning the cold war at the same time that we are increasing expenditures for our national defense establishment . The Communists would gain irreparable ground . " This program has been supported for years by both political parties , and has achieved dramatic results . It is not like America to run out now . I ca n't help but believe that when reviewed , a substantial part of the funds will be restored by the Congress . " Mr. Harriman 's hopes were not shared by many in the House . They saw in the restoration of military funds , on a motion by Mr. Passman , an effort to head off a floor fight to put back a substantial part of the cuts . Another drive is in the making to modify or restore the 38 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loans to underdeveloped countries . The committee lowered the amount by $475,000,000 . Other Major Reductions Reductions in other major catagories appeared to be so tailored by the Passman group , however , that a succession of floor contests would be necessary to restore them to the Administration 's figures . While the House has sometimes reversed the Appropriations Committee on specific items , a series of upsets would be almost impossible . Major categories cut in the bill included $75,000.000 in development grants ; $150,000,000 in investment guarantee reserves ; $75,000,000 each in the President 's contingency fund and so-called supporting assistance to countries paying more than they could afford for defense , and in the Alliance for Progress with the Latin-American republics . The report accompanying the bill challenged the validity of the Administration 's estimate as " pie-in-the-sky figures . " It described the objective of the underlying policy as beyond the nation 's capacity to finance . It argued that this country 's normal commerce with the world had become " a one-way street , " on which the Treasury paid the bills and received nothing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " unexpended funds " on hand last June 30 from previous appropriations totaled $6,712,000,000 , or more than enough to continue foreign a id at the present level of spending for 25 months without newly appropriated funds . Contention Disputed This contention by Mr. Passman has been repeatedly disputed by aid officials as reflecting a lack of understanding of the program . All funds in the so-called pipeline have been pledged or committed to specific purposes abroad , they have said . The committee had not yet restored the $300,000,000 in military funds when Mr. Passman wrote the report . But it charged that too much had been voted for this purpose in recent years . Without naming the country , it said one Government had received enough rifles ty provide tvso for every soldier in its forces . The , only major item in the bill spared the subcommittee 's surgery was the $148,900,000 requested for voluntary contributions to international organizations , such as the special funds of the United Nations .                 @ @ @ @
