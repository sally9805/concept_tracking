PAUL NEWMAN WHAT IF MY EYES TURN BROWN ? ' Now . do try to ask him one or two ' really inIelkartat questions ! I know he 'd like that ! " the public-relations girl said brightly as she led me across the set to meet Paul Newman . " You may find he 's rather slow in answering , " she went on , " hut do n't worry and do n't think he has n't heard or is n't going to answer at all . He just takes his Lime . I only mention this because some reporters have given up in despair . " When Newman saw us approaching , he began to back away behind some studio lights and a pile of planks . His flight was arrested only by the hearty voice of the public-relations girl calling out that I was " really quite a nice person . " In public , to evade recognition . he occasionally wears a pencil gripped lengthwise between his teeth . But now , accepting the inevitable , he put on a pair of dark glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a total disaster . He then took a couple of precise dance steps sideways , looked down fixedly at his bare pink feet and removed a wad of chewing gum from his mouth . This he rolled thoughtfully between thumb and forefinger for several seconds . He next gave me a brief glance from behind his glasses and walked away . Joanne Wr ( odward , Newrieni 's wily , watched him go and sighed ? " I wish you luck . I hardly get to speak to him myself these days . " . In time , however . Newman grew accustomed to my presence and stopped disappearing round corners like a startled rabbit . 1 staIilmrd myself in a disused bathroom in one corner of I lie studio , and in between lakes he woulrl sit on the edge of the bathtub and try to be a good interviewee . In this he was hampered by a curious incoherence . While repeating a question to himself , he would suddenly become trapped in a lengthy Method pause . Then his whole face and body would contort themselves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which finally resolved itself in the answer " No , " he confessed that he does n't like being interviewed because it makes him feel like " a very dull person . " Newman is most concerned not to appear as just another pretty lace . In person he is so astonishingly handsome that it is impossible not to stare at him , and everyone does all the linemen. women and children . But he is irritated by any reference to his appearance . and in particular by any Comment on his eyes . They are colorblind , and have an abnormally hard . bright-blue glitter  --  as if they were lit from within by flashlight bulbs . " People come up to me. perfect strangers , and ask rue to take off my dark glasses so they can have a look at my eyes . My answer is simple . I just say . ' Is that all you think of me ? ' Are the ? . - to write on my tombstone .

Stewart Stern . who also wrote the screenplays for Rebel II .1thr+111 a Cause , The Rack and TN l'gly .1merrerm , 15cunliitent that he has found " a filmic vocabulary fur Miss Laurence 's literary method . " Stern worked on the set with Newman throughout filming in make sure Iia ! , as he poi the sense and intention of scenes that we had agreed about in calmer moments were not destroyed impulsively and under pressure . " He had worked as closely with only one other director  --  Fred Zinnemann  --  and was convinced now that Newman was going to be " quite brilliant " as a director . Newman had taken trouble to get the best talent available and had made good use of the assembled expertise . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made difficulties . " He 's sometimes stymied simply because he does n't know how to express himself mechanically . " remarked one of the camera crew . Some of the younger hot-shots in the company . all sideburns. mustaches and magenta shirts . became a little Brushy over coffee late one night in the Danbury Motor Inn . There they were . bursting with untapped genius and Cahiers du Cbthaa. and there was Newman . who just happened to he a big box-office star . But who would give thou $700.000 to make an art movie  --  or any movie ? Next morning they were all shamefaced at such disloyalty . Newman was a great guy . For Newman . directing is now a luxury he can afford . It is also a labor of curiosity . " I 'm curious : Mout my taste , my dramatic selection , my technical ability with the camera . There 's no way to find out but to get up there and du it , and then let people hit you with baseball bats . I 've always wanted to direct because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rehearsals and the field trips , the exploration of character and the whole intellectual exercise of the thing . I enjoy this more than actually getting up on a stage or in front of a camera . That has always been more painful to me than enjoyable . I guess I 've never been that much of an exhibitionist . Then there 's something else . When you get to be around forty , it 's very necessary to make a break , or to effect some kind of wrench in your life . Suppose you start in a profession at the age of twenty-five , and make some progress in that field  --  after fifteen years it can become very re ? petitive and you should be able to call off all the answers pretty quickly . I find that I 've been repeating myself in performances , and in judg. ments. because I 'm burned out creatively . I ca n't invent any more . I 've done it . " He looked at his feet for a while . and then began a sentence with something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area . " But the words just petered out , so he went hack to watching his toes . rolling his chewing gum between his lingers , and drinking beer from a paper cup . Later he began again . It has something to do with the way you feel when you wake up in the morning . One day you say to yourself . ' My work is impeccable . There 's nothing I ca n't do . Moli.ere . Shakespeare  --  you name it ! ' But next morning you think , ' The work I am doing is childish . It is scaled to adulation and linancial return , and that return is out of all proportion to my contribution . It 's silly , its stupid . it has nothing whatever to do with being an adult . ' ' As Newman tells it now , in his " burned out " period , he became an actor almost by accident , After serving for three years as a radioman in naval torpedo planes during World War II . he went to Kenyon College in Ohio and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and economics . Then he went on to Yale School of Drama to work for his master 's degree . Although he had had some summer experience acting with repertory companies . his principal interest at this point was in directing . But he expected to have an academic life . eventually to return , perhaps . to Kenyon as a professor in subjects such as theater history and criticism . But the summer before he was due to finish his course at Yale . he went to New York on a kind of reconnoitering expedition . Immediately , and without much effort . he got a part guaranteeing him $200 a month in a television soap opera called The : Aldrich Family , together with offers of work in several CBS programs . " ' The early ' Fifties in New York were tremendously exciting because some really great psychological dramas were being shown live on television . After a while I just went from one job to another . " It began to seem almost foolish to return to his studies at Yale . Then . to his astonishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I just got very lucky . For reasons too complicated to go into now . I had only one audition there instead of two . I guess they must have misunderstood sheer terror for honest emotion . When I did my first scene for them later , there must have been some agonizing reappraisal . But once you 're in. they ca n't throw you out . I was had , really had so they have to take the credit , or the blame . for what I am today . " Newman insists that he is not a " natural " actor . He has needed every hit of training he has had . " I am the terrier type . I 've just worked away at it , doggedly . " He remains , at all times , a true believer in The Method , and a good way to pick an instant fight with him would be to malign it . In 1953 he got his first part on Broadway . in Picnic , was noticed by Warner Brothers , and put under contract immediately . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledged to be a disaster . When it was rerun on television in Los Angeles in 1963 . Newman took advertisements in all the local papers apologizing for his " lusterless , hopeless " performance . From the start reviewers began to compare him with Marlon Brando , and when in 1956 Newman played Rocky Graziano in Somebody Up There Likes Me. the similarities became undeniable . What happened . as Joanne Woodward later explained , was that Brando and Graziano were friends , and the former had used some of the mannerisms of the latter in A Streetcar Named Dane , Newman . naturally enoueh. had also studied Graziano for Sornebodv Up There Likes Me . So Brando and Newman were just a couple of Method actors using the same source . A head appeared around the door of our bathroom set . The lights had been rearranged and it was time to begin a difficult new scene about religious ecstasy at a revival meeting . When Newman decided to make A fist of God in Danbury , he sent word to the local dramatic society that he might want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this news . interest in amateur theatricals soared to record levels in Danbury . Today some 40 townsfolk were assembled in the studio to play revival celebrants at " The Tabernacle of the Risen and Reborn . " This was to be their second rehearsal . and they stood waiting patiently behind their pews . " Now , " said Newman , pacing up and down before them . " join hands in an endless chain of hysteria ! " They began to chant the words of some sort of litany , and then . working up to a crescendo. to sway and wail and moan . and to break out in sudden solo calls for grace and inspiration . Ile stood on the sidelines , barefooted , pounding list on palm and bawling instructions to them like a cheerleader at a college football game . The cameramen and grips entered into the spirit of the thing with shouts of " 1-ea Lord ! " and " I believer , while Newman prowled among his extras , encouraging and exhorting them . Whatever occasional mutterings there might have been about Newman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all about his skill as a director of actors . His wife was most earnest about this . " Ile is marvelous . It comes as a great surprise to me because 1 had never thought of him in those terms . I was n't really quite sure how it was going to turn out . Now 1 think he is the best director I have ever worked with  --  and not just because he 's my husband . He knows more directing his first picture than some directors do on their tenth . " Newman himself told me that he found that he had " good communications " with actors and actresses . I watched him having good communication with a young actor who plays the part of the revival preacher in the film . New-man 's characteristic conversational posture is right up next to the man to whom he is talking , with one arm flung round his shoulders , and his mouth about two inches away from the man 's ear . He got his actor in one of these grips and marched him up and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Directing his wife , Newman becomes almost totally physical . so that their communications sometimes suggest those of two deaf-mutes . He put the palms of his hands on her cheeks , bent forward and peered into her eves . snarled at her , and then moved his hands round to the hack of her neck and pushed her head slowly from side to side . When he stopped . she nodded in sinew agreement . He vent and sat down on a box to rest before the next take . and without speaking she began to massage his neck and shoulders , occasionally bending his head forward sharply and then jerking it back again by the hair . Newman has three daughters by Joanne Woodward . plus two more and a son by his first wife . Jackie Witte. from whom he was divorced in 1956 . The three older children divide their time between their mother , who lives in California . and their father 's house in Westport , Conn " It 's not very glamorous , " said Miss Woodward . " hut it is large and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some ground  --  which we need with live cats . two dogs and a horse . " Newman described his children as " delicious " and himself as a " selective " father . " I do n't spend as much time with my children as some fathers , but when I am with them I enjoy it , and so do they . But I do n't have a lot of patience . They know that , and they try me . But at a given point they flee in terror ! " One morning in the studio I was startled to encounter a larger and more heavily built version of Newman , a man whose features were roughly the same but had been assembled slightly differently . Newman 's older brother . krthur , who always wore an eccentrically large black-and-white-checked flat cap , was working on the set as co-producer . Before Newman launched his production company , his brother Arthur worked for a heavy-machinery company in Cleveland . where the Newman family . originally German . were secondgeneration inhabitants . Newman 's father was Jewish and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a Roman Catholic . She left the church when he was quite young and . for reasons which he is now unable to fathom , brought him up as a Christian Scientist . Just after he graduated from Kenyon College , his father died and left the management of the family sporting-goods store to his eons. " 1 t was a marvelous shop . " said Newman . " and sold all kinds of things  --  camping equipment . cameras . odd radio components . There 's no question that there can be great romance and exhilaranun in retailing . " Then he told me a long and dramatic story about a triumphant sales coup in government surplus stock made by his father at the end of World War II . " But I just did n't have the equipment to deal with the store . I 'm no gixxl at figures . for example . " But he obviously has some commercial talents . Ile once sold : PM() worth of encyclopedias in l0 days during a college vacation , and also made $60 a week working as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I got this tiny storefront on Main Street and fitted it up with laundry bins marked with initials . Then I announced for the guys to bring in their laundry because I was getting in two kegs of free beer . The beer cost me eleven bucks , and I was getting twenty-five percent of the gross from the laundry ! Those guys used to bring $t50 worth of laundry each week , and sometimes they got so drunk we put them in the bins with their clothes . " This was the only story Newman told me that might be described as amusing . In the studio he was always keen to make jokes . but he has a most peculiar sense of humor . and none of his attempts hear repeating at all . I was warned about this , though nut in any spiteful way , by some members of the crew . One of them reported having heard Joanne Woodward say to her husband one evening , " Thank God none of the children has inherited your sense of humor . Paul ! " The Newmans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved to volunteer an explanation of the phenomenon . " I 'm all in favor of a good screaming Free-for-ail every two or three months . It clears the air , gets rid of old grievances and generally makes for a pleasant relationship . Joanne has a habit of rationalizing , and when she starts that , that 's when I turn ugly ! But when she tells me what she instinctively feels , I pay very close attention . " " Instinctive , " for Newman , is a key word . He believes that he is an instinctive director . but as an actor lie calls himself " almost completely cerebral . " Ile has not had a part requiring much cerebration in a long time . He had some fun with Harper because he decided to base his performance  --  as a cynical , fast-moving private eye  --  on the personality of Bobby Kennedy . But he was n't able to explain exactly how or why he had undertaken such a character study . " I 've met Bobby Kennedy a couple of times , and he just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he listens that I stole , rather than the way he acts or talks . " Newman thinks his best film , taken as a whole , was probably The Hustler . though for his own individual performance he prefers a rather odd version of Rashonton. set in Mexico and titled The Outrage . His Iwo most recent films have both been pro-motet in roughly the same way  --  PAUL NEwraANj Is FIONIFIRE and PAUL NEWMAN As COOL FIANDJ LUKE . The implication is that his mere presence makes the film , which from a box-office reckoning may well be true . Neither of these two parts cart. , have given him much to think about , but he worked hard enough with what there was . For : Cool Hand Luke he spent some time in West Vire. ginia , where the film is set . " Sometimes you can get marvelous hangovers from these trips . " For Hombre he made a special visit to an Indian reservation . " 1 just talked to the Indians and observed how they behaved . One guy stood for an hour with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stole that stance for Hombre . 1 do n't think he ever moved , just stood there for an hour and watched everything that happened in that little street . They have very simple pleasures , " One of the ways in which Newman occupies his once-academic mind is with politics . He has a set of very definite liberal opinions . contributes money from his No Sutch Foundation to various civil-rights groups , and has opposed American intervention in Vietnam since it began . At first he was unwilling to discuss any of this , and insisted that his interest was no greater than that of the " average concerned citizen . " But he mentioned the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions , one of the organizations he supports through the No Stitch Foundation , and suddenly he began to talk enthusiastically . This center was founded in 1959 with a three-million-dollar grant from the Ford Foundation . Since it operates , in the idyllic surroundings of Santa Barbara , Calif. , at a running cost of one million dollars a year , the center has recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributors , who automatically have the right 10 turn up at any seminar or think-in that appeals to them , are Paul Newman , Kirk Douglas , Steve Allen . Dinah Shore and Jack Lemrnon . " I feel like an ass going up to these seminars , " Newman said , " hut I tell you . it is so refreshing to focus my mind on something . Pierre Menclas-France came once , and Bishop Pike , and this guy who was in Roosevelt 's brain trust . He was up there speaking on constitutional change . and so forth , and it was just as exciting as hell ! " He never said that being a director was as exciting as hell , but he had something to focus his mind on . and he seemed very happy . Sometimes he almost skipped about the studio . Film , they say . is a director 's medium . Certainly directors rarely announce that they want to become actors . or politicians . But successful actors who work in films seem prey to feelings of incurable frivolity . There must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's life in an endless series of live-minutes takes . For Newman , at least , the glamour of being a star is no compensation for the thought . when he wakes in the morning , that his work as an actor is somehow " silly , stupid . ' ' and has " nothing whatever to do with being an adult . " He has no interest in being a star , and though he drives an expensive Porsche engine , it is concealed beneath the hoed of an ordinary Volkswagen . But perhaps he has a chance now . Warner Brothers seems to have felt good vibrations from it feel of God . Anyway , they have made a deal with him . He can direct another picture for them if , in return , he will get back on the other side of the cameras and make them two more big box-office hits-
