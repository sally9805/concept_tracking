To be born with a silver spoon in one 's mouth , so goes the adage , is to be born assured of wealth . Rarer still are the spoons on which tots teethed in Olde Englande . So rare , in fact , that in 1531 , when table manners were simply a toothy process of disconnecting meat from bones , one Humfrey Cooke willed that " every one of my childrene shal have one silver spone callid the Apostles . " For when it came to skimming the crme de la crme , nothing could match a set of spoons decorated with figures of the Twelve Apostles . <P> Today , a set of such spoons is the rarest item in the market for antique silver . <P> There are only seven complete sets known . Each is made up of 13 spoons , a dozen for the saints of the Last Supper and the last for Christ . Judas Iscariot is replaced by St. Matthias , * for what father would give his child a Judas spoon to slurp up his porridge ? <P> Tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were known , one ensconced in Corpus Christi College , Cambridge , and the other in London 's Goldsmiths Hall . Currently , there are five in U.S. <P> collections , including a complete set now on view at the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown , Mass . It is the finest item in the nation 's best antique-silver collection , located in an off-the-beaten-track museum that nonetheless , eleven years after its opening , is drawing nearly 83,000 a year in attendance-more than 15 times the population of Williamstown . <P> In their rarity alone , Apostle spoons stir the imagination . The Clark Institute 's set cost around $30,000 ; another , inferior set is expected to fetch $15,000 at New York 's Parke-Bernet Galleries later this month . The spoons have sculptured knops at the end of their handles , portraying the saints . Each Apostle bears his symbol , or the tools of his martyrdom : St. John holds a cup symbolic of the poisoned wine he was ordered to drink ; St. Bartholomew is shown with a knife to signify his being flayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Persia . <P> Forks for Dandies . In 16th and 17th century England , lucky lordlings dined with Apostle spoons given to them as baptismal gifts . Forks were a dandy 's innovation from Italy , and young men returning from the Grand Tour in Shakespeare 's day with tined implements in their pockets were thought effeminate by their deft-fingered fathers . When spoons did become common tableware , they had elongated bowls , less suitable for chopping food than balancing tiny reservoirs of soup . Still , as talismans of gentle birth , Apostle spoons were an exquisite beginning to a surfeit of flatware , which , by 1911 , yielded services of 138 individual pieces per place setting , from pea spoons to asparagus tongs . <P> <P> * The Apostles usually represented in spoons : Matthew , Peter , John , Andrew , Philip , Bartholomew , Thomas , James , James the Less , Simon the Zealot , Thaddaeus , Matthias .
