In death , Ho Chi Minh last week achieved what had begun to look like an impossible feat . He brought Soviet Premier Aleksei Kosygin and Communist Chinese Premier Chou En-lai together for perhaps as much as 41 hours of talks . In his final testament , Ho described how " deeply I am grieved at the dissensions that are dividing the fraternal parties . " Few parties have been less fraternal lately than the Chinese and the Russian , yet both , for their own reasons , responded to Ho 's plea for unity . Though the conference at Peking Airport appeared to leave intact the deep ideological chasm between the two , the mere fact that the meeting took place was intriguing . <P> The last high-level Sino-Soviet confrontation was held in February 1965 , as Kosygin was also on his way home from a visit to Hanoi . On that occasion , Kosygin made it farther than the airport-he was received by Chairman Mao Tse-tung . Almost certainly , they then agreed on the need to increase aid to North Viet Nam , but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since then , the feud has grown to epic proportions . Last March , just after a bitter , bloody Soviet-Chinese clash on the Ussuri River , Kosygin sought to telephone Peking 's leaders . As Chinese Defense Minister Lin Piao later told the story , the Chinese replied coldly : " In view of the present relations between China and the Soviet Union , it is unsuitable to communicate by telephone . If the Soviet government has anything to say , it is asked to put it forward officially through diplomatic channels . " Despite the snub , Moscow persisted-and again was turned down . Finally , this summer , the Soviets and the Chinese managed to hold low-level talks on border river navigation , and the stage seemed to have been set for more significant border talks . Then a new clash broke out along the Sinkiang-Kazakhstan border , and in the past month , Peking and Moscow have exchanged serious charges . Peking accused the Russians of causing an astounding 429 border incidents in June and July alone . Moscow countered last week by charging China with 488 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further encroachments " will be most resolutely rebuffed . " <P> Only Ho 's death , and the opportunity it offered the Chinese to strengthen their position in North Viet Nam , seem to have brought Peking to the point of agreeing to a new meeting . Certainly , the Chinese could not have snubbed Ho 's posthumous plea for an end to comradely hostility without offending Hanoi . Rumanian Premier Ion Gheorghe Maurer , who stopped off in Peking en route home to Bucharest after Ho 's funeral , appealed for Sino-Soviet talks . Moreover , the Chinese had stumbled badly in their handling of North Viet Nam over the past several days . Chou had flown to Hanoi before Ho 's funeral , then left with almost indecent haste in the face of Kosygin 's arrival . Neither Chairman Mao nor No. 2 Man Lin bothered to show up to register condolences with North Viet Nam 's embassy in Peking ; China watchers suggested that Mao and Lin , who have not been seen in public for nearly four months , may be gravely ill.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
