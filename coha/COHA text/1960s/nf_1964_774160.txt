txt  | in the efficacy of our prayers , for " the Lord is nigh to all those who call upon Him , to all who call upon Him in truth " ( Ps. cxlv. 18 ) ' . Werblowsky 's lengthy summary of the fifth principle reads : The Obligation to worship God alone . This article actually embodies the practical corollary of monotheism ? the duty to serve God and God alone . It not only excludes other divinities ( already ruled out by the denial of their existence in art . 2 ) but forbids the worship of or even appeal to other powers , forces and intermediaries . The few instances in the liturgy in which angels are addressed and requested to bring our prayers before the throne of the Almighty have given rise to controversy . Thinkers like Bahya even denied the existence of intermediaries or " secondary causes " ' . In its simple and popular formulation the article merely states that God is the only object of prayer .

The efficacy of petitionary prayer is usually taken for granted , in spite of the serious theological problems which it raises . Rabbinic tradition sees in prayer a divine Mitzwah or commandment : God desires man to express his love of him , dependence on him and wish to commune with him in this form . In every prayer , then , there is the purest and most concentrated expression of what life as a whole , understood as the service of God , should signify . The Rabbis deduced the duty of daily prayer from the more generalized Biblical injunction " to serve him with all thine heart " . " Which is the service of the heart ? " they ask , and reply : " This is prayer " . The order and character of prayer was regulated by the Rabbis so as to include praise , thanksgiving and petition .

Later , modernist writers occasionally explained the meaning of prayer as " self-examination " and the like ; in the place of the dialogue with God they put an edifying monologue ' . The fifth article of faith actually contains three ideas : ( 1 ) That God is to be worshipped . ( 2 ) That God is not to be worshipped through an intermediary . ( 3 ) That no other being , apart from God , is to be worshipped . A discussion of the fifth article ought to consider each of these propositions . ( 1 ) God is to be worshipped .

' ( ' Commentary ' , April , 1962 , p . S02 ) . Singer pokes gentle fun at his elderly hero but anyone acquainted with Eastern European Jews of the old school , whether Hasidim or their opponents , knows that for very many of them the worship of God through the performance of His commandments was , in truth , the greatest joy of their lives . Another anecdote with the same theme tells of an elderly Jewish woman who complained to Rabbi Hertzog , the late Chief Rabbi of Israel , that her sons were not observant Jews , they did not keep the mitzvoth . The Rabbi , wishing to console the poor woman , told her that her sons  | had behaved with such bravery in the War of Liberation that , he assured her , they would have a share irk the Life to Come .

' These observations are not irrelevant to the theme of worship . The person who approaches the matter from the outside finds the whole conception of worship strange , even ludicrous . Is worship for God 's benefit or for man 's ? To reply that it is for man 's benefit and to attempt an evaluation of ritual in this light , inevitably results in absurdity . Great names in the past have lent the power of their authority to an interpretation of the dietary laws , for example , as an aid to good health , but if the matter is left at that the inadequacy of the explanation becomes apparent . For the very concept of worship suggests man 's service of the Creator , man 's giving of himself for the sake of Heaven .

The dilemma is insoluble for one who sees it from the outside . But for the Jews , like those we have mentioned , who see it all from within , who live by the Torah and in the performance of the mitzvoth , the difficulty is unreal . For them there is no doubt that worship is for God 's sake in the sense that it is a giving of the self to the Creator . Much of it is , indeed , useless ' so far as man is concerned . Even where worship does have the effect of enriching man 's life , either materially or mentally , such enrichment is a by-product , not an aim . But the giving of the self in worship of the Highest is in itself the greatest enrichment of the human personality there is .

As it rises towards purity and leaves egotistic piety behind , He becomes more and more the only Fact of existence , the one Reality ; and the very meaning of Creation is seen to be an act of worship , a devoted proclamation of the splendour , the wonder , and the beauty of God . In this great Sanctus , all things justify their being and have their place . God alone matters , God alone Is ? creation only matters because of Him ' . The question we are considering , whether worship is for God 's sake or for man 's , was answered by the Qabbalists according to their frequently occurring distinction between God as He is in Himself ? ' En Soph ? and God in His manifestations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveals Himself to others . We have touched on this Qabbalistic doctrine earlier . So far as our present theme is concerned , the Qabbalistic teaching is that while ' En Soph can not be said to need human worship , the harmony of the Sephirotic world depends , in some measure at least , on the deeds of men . If man leads a virtuous life he draws down the divine influence from above , producing harmony and balance in the whole of God 's creation . The Shekhinah , the Divine Presence of God , exiled from her source , is restored to her rightful place and peace reigns in all worlds . If man leads a vicious life his evil deeds help to promote an imbalance in the Sephirotic world . The Shekhinah remains in exile and the divine grace can not flow . The whole of God 's creation suffers as a result and the divine purpose is frustrated . Thus man is placed at the centre of the cosmic drama . Every evil deed on earth is a hindrance to redemption . Every good deed paves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work of reclaiming the divine sparks ' , which fell into all things at the beginning of creation , is completed , redemption will come and the exile of the Shekhinah will be ended . All this has been dubbed magical ' by critics of the Qabbalah and there is much substance in the critique . For all that there is grandeur in the idea that somehow man 's deeds really help ' God and that worship is truly for God 's sake , that He might fulfil His purpose . The above ideas are put forward in all the great classical Qabbalistic works and are usefully summarised in Isaiah Horowitz 's ( c. 1555 ? 1628 ) Shen Luhoth Ha-Berith ' , called  | after its initial letters , Shelah or The Holy Shelah ' , a gigantic compendium of Rabbinic and Qabbalistic teachings . ' The Shelah deals with our theme in the section of the work tlear the beginning known as the Ten Words ' - ' Asarah a ' - amaroth ' . These are principles of divine worship of which the fourth is entitled Worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake of God ' . Horowitz begins by describing the purpose of man 's creation . This was that man might serve God . When Adam and his descendants sinned God chose the Patriarchs and sent their offspring into Egypt , the house of bondage , that they might there learn the bitter lesson of human bondage and thereby become equipped to serve God . Horowitz defines his conception of worship for the needs of the Most High ' to mean that it is not enough for man to carry out God 's precepts with joy and delight . In addition , he must intend to bring about the harmony in the upper worlds which his deeds can help to promote , for this is the tremendous power given to man . When harmony prevails in the upper worlds God 's name is perfected and as a result all worlds become perfected and enjoy peace and blessing . God then rejoices in His creation and His purpose is fulfilled since He created all things for His glory and brought into being creatures capable of recognising His majesty . Then the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Source of all goodness . The sinner , on the other hand , brings about a flaw ' ? pegam ? in the upper worlds through each sin he commits with the result that God 's name is imperfect , His blessing withheld and His purpose frustrated . The true worshipper does not serve God for his own sake but because God needs his worship for the perfection of His name . Such a worshipper never departs from God 's service , day and night ; he neither slumbers nor sleeps . He never ceases from observing the severe precepts and the light , the Biblical and the Rabbinic , as well as later enactments of the Sages and the " fences " around the Law , and he takes care against sinning even unwittingly since atonement is required even for an unwitting sin ' . The followers of the Qabbalah , particularly the Hasidim , still stress ideas of this kind , offering their prayers and performing the precepts of the Torah in firm belief that these acts of man have cosmic significance and satisfy , as it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | by man so that His goodness and grace might flow through all the worlds . But such views , though popular in Qabbalistic circles , are certainly unconventional . Usually Judaism prefers to speak of man 's need to worship rather than God 's need of man 's worship . But , as we have noted , the problem is really far too complicated to permit of a simple division into man 's needs and the needs ' of God . God wants man to worship Him because only in this way can man reach out to the divine , be aware of God 's presence and His majesty , and become God-like . Worship , in Judaism , is expressed in three ways : in prayer , in the study of the Torah , and in the performance of the precepts of the Torah . To consider how each of these operates in Jewish life is beyond the scope of this work . An investigation into all the phases of Jewish worship would involve a number of lengthy treatises , would , in reality , involve the fullest examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach for our purpose is to study in some detail the meaning of worship as interpreted in one of the finest summaries in Jewish devotional literature ? Alexander Siisskind of Grodno 's resod We-Shoresh Ha-Abhodah ' , the work referred to in our discussion of the second article of faith . Alexander Siisskind 's work is divided into a number of Gates ' , most of which are in the form of devotional commentaries to the Jewish liturgy . The first of these , called The Great Gate ' , he describes as : A great introduction which has as its aim the inflammation of men 's hearts for divine worship in love and fear , including divine worship in heart and mind ' ( The edition used is that of Warsaw , 1870 ) . The author begins ( p. 313 ) by stating that God 's purpose in creating the world was for man to serve God so that God might derive satisfaction ? nahath ruah ? from man 's worship . The author supports this thesis by quotations from Bible , Talmud and the mediaeval thinkers . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( III , 111b ) in which it is said that Israel is called both son ' and servant ' of the Most High ; son ' because men can know the supernal mysteries , and servant ' because it is man 's duty to worship God , in Temple times with sacrifices and at other times with prayer and the performance of the precepts . Although he is no philosopher , Alexander  | Susskind is not unaware of the theological difficulties inherent in the idea that God needs ' man 's worship . His attempted solution is that God does not actually need man 's deeds but that He is pleased ' when man affords Him the satisfaction of doing His will . In this connection the author quotes the Rabbinic saying that the term a pleasing odour unto the Lord ' ( Lev . i. 9 ) is used of animal sacrifices to signify satin ' faction ( nahath ruah ) to Me by the knowledge that I gave the command and My will was executed ' ( Sizhra ad loc. , Zeb. 46b ) . No attempt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , why God should be thought to derive satisfaction ' from man 's deeds or how God can be said to derive satisfaction ' at all ? The language of simple piety is content with the idea that man in his worship of God provides God , as it were , with nahath ruah , the satisfaction of knowing that His will has been done . Alexander Susskind continues ( 4a ) that the nature of the satisfaction ' man affords God consists in man 's love and fear of Him . Fearing God means the avoidance of sin , i.e. the observance of the negative precepts of the Torah , while love means keeping the positive precepts . God derives special pleasure from man 's study of the Torah and from man 's praise of Him . Although God has created the angelic hosts and worlds without number , all of which join in praise of Him , He derives greater satisfaction from the praises of puny man , occupying a physical body in the material world , than from all of these . Indeed , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worship . Alexander Susskind sums it up as follows : The main intention of the Creator , blessed be He , and His main purpose in creation , is for the sake of man , that he might by his worship give satisfaction to God , blessed be His name . Happy is the man who fears the Lord and delights exceedingly in His commandments , who is mighty upon earth to perfect the upper worlds by his thought and utterance all the days of his life in this world . This note is sufficient for the intelligent ' . In the second chapter of this Gate ' ( 4a ) the author notices that there are degrees in men 's worship , not all men being equal in the stages they can attain . The greater man 's recognition of God 's glory and majesty the greater his delight in the privilege that has been granted to him of worshipping God .  | The man of deep religious feeling is nowadays able to contemplate on the vastnesses of space revealed by modern astronomy to evoke his sense of wonder at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such facts as the tremendous distances covered by the , light of the stars before it reaches our planet and the enormous size of the heavenly bodies beside which our tiny world pales into insignificance . Alexander Siisskind , not having these means at his disposal , seeks to recall his readers to a profound sense of their creatureliness and God 's awful majesty by describing the numerous worlds which the Zohar states as existing . Thus it is said in the portion of the Zohar known as the Great Assembly ' , " Idra Rabba ' ( III , 128b ) , that there is a certain most elevated and fearful world from which proceeds a million times seventeen thousand five hundred brilliant and pure lights , each of which is , in turn , divided into four hundred and ten parts ( the numerical value of the Hebrew term gadosh ' , holy ' ) and each of these particles of light powerfully illumines four hundred and ten worlds . Each of these worlds is hidden , only the highest world from which the lights proceed knowing their secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitting that every Jew , a member of the holy people , should give thanks with all his might to the blessed Creator for choosing him and giving him the portion of worshipping God by means of the performance of His precepts and the study of His holy Torah , thus endowing him with the capacity to apprehend some small portion of the greatness of the Creator , blessed be He . For this was the blessed Creator 's intention in creating man in this world to recognise God 's greatness and His majesty ' . A further means by which man can recognise God 's glory ( 5b ) and avoid having a . God who is too small ' is the contemplation of the wonders of God as revealed in the marvels of nature , the miracle of the human mind , for instance . Here the author follows Bahya Ibn Paqudah who devotes a section of his Duties of the Heart ' ( ' Gate II , Sha'ar Ha-Behinah ' ) to the duty of examination ' , i.e. of discerning the wisdom of the Creator in His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of the higher fear ' of God , yirath ha-romamuth ' , which appears to correspond with Otto 's idea of the numinous ' . Alexander Siisskind gives this illustration . Imagine a man renowned for his saintliness ,  | holiness and great wisdom so that others stand in awe of him and fear to approach him . Such fear is not of what the holy man may do , for a sage of his calibre will certainly avoid doing anything harmful . It is simply the awareness of one 's own insignificance in the presence of such greatness which acts an an inhibiting factor . And yet , for all that , the holy man exercises a powerful fascination over others who , embarrassed though they are by their own unworthiness in his presence , wish to be near to him . At the slightest token of encouragement they will overcome their natural apprehensions and seek to approach him and enjoy the privilege of serving him . The same two elements of recoil and fascination are present in man 's . higher fear ' of God . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of sheer creatureliness and unworthiness coupled with a tremendous longing to be near to Him . In Scripture God has given man the token of encouragement for which he yearns if he is to draw near to offer his supplications before God 's throne , since in many Scriptural verses it is implied that God is nigh to those who call on Him in truth . Chapter four ( 6a ) offers counsel to the man desirous of making the higher fear ' of God his own . First , he should contemplate on God 's power , glory and majesty , as stated above . Secondly , he should reflect that God knows all the deeds and thoughts of men , penetrating even to the most secret recesses of the heart . Even the Gentiles admit that God knows all man 's thoughts , just as the watchmaker is certainly familiar with all the complicated workings of the time-pieces he fashions . Whenever man is tempted to do a forbidden thing or to have an unworthy thought he should reflect that God knows of this , that his offence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shekhinah . Chapter five ( 6b ) offers counsel on how man can find many opportunities for God 's worship . The author gives a number of illustrations and hopes that his readers will discover for themselves similar means of affording God the satisfaction ' of which he has spoken . For instance , whenever a man notices that a regular worshipper in his Synagogue is absent through sickness or some other mishap he should feel aggrieved that some of the praise due to God is lacking . Particularly , if the  | absent one is a scholar he should be grieved at all the Torah which can not now be studied and all the deep praises of the Creator which can not now be offered . Conversely , his heart should overflow with joy whenever he notices that a fellowcongregant is offering his prayers with profound concentration and thereby giving great delight to his Father in Heaven . It is said of a certain saint that he would rejoice whenever he heard that a male child had been born in a Jewish home for a new recruit had been added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author observes that the same saint would rejoice ' even ' if a girl had been born for women , too , are capable of offering their share of God 's praises and thus add to God 's delight that His will has been done . It goes without saying the child 's father should rejoice that he has brought another of God 's servants into the world . The father 's heart should similarly be full to overflowing whenever his child reaches some stage in the spiritual life of a Jew , when , for instance , he begins to pray or to study the Torah . Conversely a man should grieve whenever he hears of a death , particularly the death of a scholar , for all God 's glory which now goes unrecognised and unsung . Similarly , if man hears that someone has had good fortune in his business he should rejoice at the increase in God 's glory , for the fortunate one will surely give thanks to God for His goodness and will use part of his fortune in good deeds and charity . Conversely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should grieve at the loss of opportunity of acknowledging God 's goodness . Whenever he notices someone in pain he should grieve both because a human being suffers and because God , being with him in his pain , suffers too . This affords God great nahath ruah ' , that man suffers with Him . Before the advent of a festival man should delight at the opportunity that is about to be given him of carrying out God 's will in the performance of the special precepts of the festival , the eating of unleavened bread on Passover for example . Chapter six ( 7b ) gives further illustrations of the nahath ruah ' idea . Whenever a man comes upon a difficult passage in a holy book and , after concentrated effort , is able to grasp the meaning , he should say : Sovereign of all worlds , I give thanks and praise to Thy great name for having given me the power  | of understanding Thy holy and perfect Torah ' . Similarly , whenever he reads a marvellously profound interpretation of the Torah in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endowed the author of the book with the intelligence required to reveal the wonders of God 's Torah and he should reflect in astonishment , if such is the achievement of mortal wisdom , how great is the divine wisdom ! At all times man should accustom himself to say : I believe with perfect faith that Thou art One and Unique ' and in this way he will serve God all the time . At every step man takes he should open his eyes to gaze on the wondrous wisdom of the Creator , in the grass which grows , in the food he eats , even in the stone , which is but the lowest form in the physical world of some divine aspect of God 's creation in the supernal realms , and he should proclaim constantly : The mighty deeds of God , the mighty deeds of God ! ' So far Alexander Susskind might be accused of neglecting his fellow-men for God . In fact , in his view , the whole idea of giving God nahath ruah ' is impossible unless human relationships are themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great believer in ( as Walt Whitman was later to put it ) seeing God in the faces of men and women . In Chapter seven ( 8a ) he develops this theme at length . Man must accustom himself to carry out constantly two positive precepts of the Torah ? Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself ' ( Lev . xix. 18 ) and In righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour ' ( Lev . xix. 15 ) . Both these precepts are to be found in the Holiness Code in Leviticus , for if man accustoms himself to fulfil them he will certainly attain the highest stage of all , becoming a holy man . He should love his neighbour as himself , that is to say , he should be as delighted with his neighbour 's good fortune as he is with his own and should grieve at his neighbour 's bad fortune as if the mishap had befallen him . Just as he dislikes the thwarting of his own desires he should never do anything to his neighbour which does not meet with the latter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there appear to be no mitigating circumstances he should , nonetheless , find any excuses he can rather than judge his neighbour guilty of wrong-doing . Whenever man rejoices at his neighbour 's good fortune  | and grieves at his loss he fulfils the precept of loving his neighbour as himself . Unlike other precepts of the Torah this one can be fulfilled at all times , even when he is in an unclean place in which it is forbidden to have in mind sacred things . These two precepts are among the most difficult to carry out since men are by nature envious of one another . How great , then , is the reward of the man capable of self-mastery in his desire to obey his Creator ! In Chapter eight ( Sb ) the theme is developed further . It is obvious that when others share the grief of one in sorrow his load is lessened whereas lack of concern for his misery on the part of others only serves to increase his trouble . It is sound Rabbinic teaching that God is pained at human sorrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares the grief of the Shekhinah and he lessens thereby , as it were , God 's sorrows . Similarly , by rejoicing in his neighbour 's joys he increases God 's joy since God rejoices in human happiness . The author claims that if man will only fulfil these two precepts as they should be carried out his prayers will be pure and free from all extraneous and disturbing thoughts . Chapter nine ( 9a ) describes a further means of worshipping God at all times and in every act . Bahya Ibn Paqudah ( ' Gate of Divine Worship ' , Chapter 4 ) makes the point that although from the legal aspect of Judaism all acts are divided into the licit , the illicit and the obligatory , from the moral point of view there is no such thing as the licit , in the sense of a neutral act which is neither good nor bad . For the devout Jew every one of his deeds is either essential , in which case it is obligatory , or inessential , in which case it is illicit . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which man is left to himself with God excluded , no opportunity for men to have a holiday from moral decision , no possibility of self-indulgence with the claim that the deed he performs is not in itself contrary to Jewish law . Alexander Siisskind gives a number of examples , for instance the act of eating . If man eats in order to gain strength for God 's service , eating no forbidden food and enjoying only sufficient for his physical needs , and if , in addition , he conducts himself properly at his table , then in the very act of eating he carries out divine worship . Where one of these conditions remains unfulfilled the act of eating becomes sinful.  | Gluttony , for instance , even if it involves permitted food , is a sin because it is both harmful to health and because it encourages man in his slothful and gross habits and thereby hinders him from serving God . In similar fashion all five senses have their illicit and obligatory aspects . Whenever man engages his senses in due proportion and with proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an act of divine worship . If the senses are indulged in illicit or uncontrolled fashion they are the causes of sin . In Chapter ten ( 9b ) the author observes that it is impossible to be a true worshipper of God unless one has acquired the quality of equanimity in the sense of complete imperviousness to human praise or blame . It should be the same to the true worshipper of God whether people praise or blame him . He should neither attach any value to human praise nor fear human censure , otherwise his pure intention in carrying out good deeds will be sullied since part of his mind will be engaged in considering whether the deeds he does will bring him fame or condemnation . The antidote has been given , states the author , by Bahya Ibn Paqudah ( Gate on Unification of Action ' , Chapter 5 ) . This consists of a constant reminder of the illusory nature of human fame . How can human beings be of any real help to others ? Even if a man wins world-wide renown his deeds are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a man succeeds in praying with great devotion in the Synagogue he should never be tempted to enjoy the admiration of his fellow-congregants but should imagine that he is offering his prayers in a forest among trees where it would be absurd to feel pride at the admiration of the trees . However , man should never cut short his good deed out of fear that people might look upon him as a saint for this is a pretext of the evil inclination . Chapter eleven ( l0a ) deals with man 's intention of sacrificing himself in theory . We have noted earlier , in the section dealing with the second principle of faith , Alexander Siisskind 's views on this matter . His views on worship in this section of his work have been quoted here in full because they are a more or less typical example of Jewish piety at its best in the preEmancipation era . Worship according to our author consists , then , in giving God the satisfaction of doing His will . This  | aim is achieved in various ways ? through contemplation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and acknowledging His goodness at all times ; through loving one 's neighbour as oneself ; through sanctifying the licit ; through being impervious to human praise and blame ; and through firm resolve to be prepared to suffer martyrdom , if need be , for God 's sake . This type of piety is not to everyone 's taste . There are sufficient theological objections , for instance , to the whole idea of God desiring ' nahath ruah ' . It is also questionable whether it is psychologically possible for man to rejoice and be grieved at events in his neighbour 's life as if these had happened to him . Since there are ' neighbours ' without number one who tried to live by the saint 's counsel would always be in a state of both intense joy and profound sorrow . Furthermore , to urge men to cultivate indifference to praise or blame is to deprive life of one of its great incentives and is certainly a hindrance to the kind of life in society that Judaism , in its normative form , seeks to inculcate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jew . He wishes to lead a normal life and to participate in the world 's work . And yet , unless he is completely lacking in spiritual sensitivity , he can not help seeing the grandeur and spiritual beauty in an approach such as that of Alexander Siisskind . He will try to work out his own solution to the problem of devoutness but works such as this will help serve as a powerful reminder of the role which worship should occupy in Jewish life and that religion is more than good conduct and ethical behaviour . William James 's discussion of the value of saintliness ( ' The Varieties of Religious Experience ' , Longmans , Green , London , 1905 , Lectures XIV and XV , pp. 326 ff. ) is germane here . James refers to the impression of extravagance produced by the kind of pietistic literature we have been considering . Is it necessary to be quite so fantastically good as that ? We are glad that saints existed to show us the way but they did so at the cost of a one-sidedness for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may lead to fanaticism , purity to a neglect of family and social relationships , tenderness and charity to indulgence of evil in society , and asceticism to a morbid violation of human nature . So far as this world is concerned , says James , any one who makes an out-and-out  | saint of himself does so at his peril . For all that , life 's saints and spiritual heroes bring an irridation into the world , a profounder sense of mystery , wonder and goodness without which we would all be the poorer . Not all Jews can be expected to live as Alexander Siisskind would have them do , nor is it desirable that they should do so . But a Judaism without such men and the ideal of worship they represent would be a poor faith incapable of providing its adherents with that satisfaction of man 's yearning for the Infinite on which all true religion is based . Mention must here be made of Maimonides ' famous chapter on How God is worshipped by a Perfect Man ' ( ' Guide ' , III , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maimonides begins with a parable . A king is enthroned in his palace . Some of his subjects are abroad and some have their backs to the palace and are bent on travelling away from it . Others desire to enter the palace to minister to the king but have not even seen the face of the wall which surrounds it . Others go around the palace wall without discovering the entrance . Others again have proceeded farther into the ante-rooms of the palace while still others have succeeded in entering into the monarch 's presence . But even the latter can not converse with the king until they have made the effort required of those to whom the privilege of conversation with the king is granted . The parable is applied to the religious life of mankind . The subjects of the King of kings who are abroad ' are those with no religion at all . Worse than these are those who hold false doctrines in religion . They have their backs to the palace ' . A son of his age , Maimonides remarks that under certain circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extirpate their doctrines , in order to prevent them misleading others . Those who desire to enter the palace but have not seen it are the mass of religious people , who observe the divine commandments but are ignorant . Those who go around the palace are the traditionalists who observe all the practical demands of the Torah and study it thoroughly but who are unversed in philosophy . Others again have used their reasoning powers to prove the truths of religion and have thus entered the ante-chamber of the palace . But those who have proved as much of religion as is humanly possible , who have attained in this way a true knowledge of  | God , have reached the goal and are in the palace in which lives the king . Thus , for Maimonides , true worship is for the intellectual aristocrat , the metaphysician whose thoughts are centred on God , who understands the proofs for God 's existence and how God controls the world . The more such a man reflects on God and the more he thinks on Him the more is he engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when correct notions of Him have previously been conceived . In other words , only the philosopher can truly worship God , both because the worship of the unphilosophical mind is not really directed towards God but towards a figment of the human imagination , and because the essence of worship is intellectual perception of the truths about God . Since it is the intellect which is the link that joins man to God , the true worshipper will spend as much time as he possibly can in meditation upon God 's name . We must bear in mind , ' says Maimonides in an oft-quoted passage , that all such religious acts as reading the Law , praying , and the performance of other precepts , serve exclusively as the means of causing us to occupy and fill our mind with the precepts of God , and free it from worldly business ; for we are then , as it were , in communication with God , and undisturbed by any other thing . If we , however , pray with the motion of our lips , and our face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our business ; if we read the Law with our tongue , whilst our heart is occupied with the building of our house , and we do not think of what we are reading ; if we perform the commandments only with our limbs , we are like those who are engaged in digging the ground , or hewing wood in the forest , without reflecting on the nature of those acts , or by whom they were commanded , or what is their object ' . Man should train himself gradually , continues Maimonides , to recite some of his prayers with proper inwardness . Once he has mastered this art he should go on to include other prayers and the benedictions until all acts of divine worship are performed with the mind entirely abstracted from worldly affairs . When you are alone by yourself , when you are awake on your couch , be careful to meditate in such precious moments on nothing but the intellectual worship of God , viz. , to approach Him and to minister before Him in the true manner which I have described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I consider as the highest perfection wise men can attain by the above training ' . Maimonides goes on to claim that one who has really reached the elevated stage of constantly being with God in his thoughts has attained the spiritual degree of a prophet and nothing in the world can harm him . He is , indeed , immune from mental and physical mishap and can not be touched by evil . If the objections to the views on worship of Alexander Siisskind are that they are too naive the opposite objection can be levelled against Maimonides ' ideas on the same subject . On his view , true worship is impossible to all but a few rare souls equipped with the spiritual resources and intellectual gifts to engage in prolonged meditation and rigorous metaphysical studies . The true worshipper is a kind of Yogi . But traditional Judaism is a religion for all the community of Israel ' and is , indeed , so described by Maimonides himself in his great Code of Law . It would be superficial and altogether too facile an approach to consider whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the spiritual mentor of the modern Jew in this matter of worship . Judaism is far too complex to permit of a simple either/or in this field . The truth of the matter is rather that in the teachings of these two men , and of many other masters of the devout life , there is rich nourishment for hungry souls . But , like physical nourishment , it must be taken in proper measure . A man 's spiritual diet must be balanced , to suit his temperament ; it must be rich in spiritual vitamins but not over-rich . Here , as in matters of physical diet , one man 's meat is another 's poison . The great idea which emerges from these and from all similar descriptions of Jewish worship is that it must be God-orientated to deserve the name . EXCURSUS The Chapter on Jewish Worship ' in Evelyn Underhill 's book , op. cit. , pp. 19s f. , is stimulating but is written from the Christian standpoint , besides needing supplementation and correction in several details . The author remarks that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was from the beginning peculiarly sensitive towards God . She notes that the connection of Fire with  | Divine Presence runs right through the Hebrew Bible : e.g. the Burnin Bush , the Pillar of Fire , the flame and smoke of Sinai , on which God descended in His glory ' like devouring fire ' ( Ex. 17 ; cf. x. xix. 18 , Deut. ix . 15 and xviii . 16 ) , the sacrifices of Elijah on Mount Carmel , the visions of Ezekiel and Daniel . For Semitic thought , she says , fire and light were essential attributes of the divine self-disclosure : and this conception has had a marked influence on Jewish ritual worship . No examples are given by the author but one might refer to the Sabbath and Festival lights , the blessing over fire at the conclusion of the Sabbath ( Singer 's P.B. p. 108 and 216 ) , the light kindled in a house of mourning and on the anniversary of a death , the candles before the ark in the Synagogue , the ' Perpetual Lamp ' in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Sabbath ( Ex. xxxv. 3 ) , the kindling of the Hanukkah lights , the rejoicing in Temple times on the feast of Tabernacles ( v. Mishnah , Sukk . V. 2-4 ) , and the burning of leaven on the eve of Passover . The favourite symbol of which the Qabbalists represent the Sephirotic world is ' light ' . Cf. the Habhdalah prayer recited at the conclusion of the Sabbath ( Singer 's P.B. p. 216 ) : ' Blessed art Thou , 0 Lord our God , King of the universe , who makest a distinction between holy and profane , between light and darkness , between Israel and other nations , between the seventh day and the six working days ' . Evelyn Underhill further remarks that the strange history of Israel is of a people dominated by that thirst for God , that certitude of God and that sense of obligation to God , which form the raw material of all worship . Among all the religions of antiquity Israel 's alone is based upon that confident dependence on the Unseen which is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author describes the famous vision of Isaiah ( Is. vi . 1 ? 8 ) : ' Here God is revealed to His prophet as the Wholly Other , the Object of man 's awestruck adoration , and also as the Wholly Good , setting a standard of holiness and convicting man of sin : and a step forward is taken in that total sanctification and redemption of experience , which is the manward aim of worship . Before Him the seraphim veil their faces ; yet He asks for the willing and open-eyed co-operation of imperfect men . His nature is indeed disclosed in those theophanies which show something of His ineffable glory , glints of a world of living splendour beyond the conception of man : but also , in the demand for purity , mercy , truth , and devotedness which He makes upon His human creatures . In both , in different ways , He requires their unlimited self-offering : an inward dedication of personality expressed by outward signs . Therefore , the Torah , the Law , is itself a disclosure of the supernatural , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a creature in the ordinary sense , but a revelation of the Eternal , a reflection of the Divine Mind , final and immutable : and the rigid obedience it demands and secures ? whether in the sphere of ritual or of morals ? is not mere submission to a code , but an act of adoration ' . ( Cf. on this theme C. S. Lewis 's popular ' Reflections on the Psalms ' , G. Bles , London , 1958 , particularly Chapter VI : Sweeter than Honey ' , pp. 54 f ) . It is doubtful , however , to say the least , whether the author is justified in seeing the names of tie twelve tribes on the shoulder-straps of the High Priest as a firs hint of the ministry of mediation ' . What is the author 's source for the statement ( p. 201 , note 2 ) that blue was and is for Jewish thought the colour of the Shekhinah ' ? A further important point made by the author is that it is a mark of Israel 's spiritual genius that from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intense aversion to all images of the Divine . There follows a vivid description of Synagogal worship centering around the reading of the Torah . The author is not , of course , entirely correct when she observes that the non-sacerdotal ' character of Synagogal worship is such that the priest as such has no prerogative and that any member may be called to the reading or exposition of the Law ' ( p. 209 , note 1 ) . The first aliyah is always given to the kohen , the descendant of the priests , and the second to a Levite . The priestly blessing is still performed by the kohanim . Evelyn Underhill concludes that if worship is to be true to the Jewish conception it will not be all bright and clear , thin in colour , humanistic and thisworld in feeling . It will retain the ancient sense of cloud and darkness , other-worldly fire and light , which still lives in the Psalter ; the awe before a sacred mystery which is with us yet never of us , the deep sense of imperfection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a God who has set His glory above the heavens and yet is mindful of the children of men ' . It is , indeed , a pity that so few Synagogue buildings have been successful in capturing the mood of which Evelyn Underhill speaks . Ideally a Synagogue ought not to give those who worship within its walls merely a sense of comfort and ease . There ought to be something of the numinous ' about the edifice , leading them to exclaim : How full of awe is this place ! this is none other than the house of God , and this is the gate of heaven ' ( Gen. xxviii. 17 ) . In this connection , too , perhaps the modern Synagogue has , in its attempt at the modernisation ' or Westernisation ' of the services , gone too far in virtually abolishing all sense of the mysterious . The older type of chant , the prayer shawl worn over the head , even the swaying of the body , frowned upon by certain mediaeval scholars , did produce an atmosphere of other-worldliness ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such practices are declared ' outlandish ' . There is no easy solution to this problem . Few would suggest a return to the old pattern but many Jews sensitive to the prayerful mood feel that something ought to be done to recapture it for the modern Synagogue . On swaying in prayer v. the article by J. D. Eisenstein in JE , Vol . XI , p. 607 . Eisenstein 's quotation , with approval from Simon Brainin , who suggests that the purpose of swaying in prayer was to afford exercise during study and prayer , is incredibly banal . Bodily movements in prayer are , of course , found very frequently in the East , the ' dancing dervishes ' being only the best-known example . The main Jewish sources for the custom are : Zohar III , 118b ? 119a ; Judah Ha-Levi 's ' Kuzari ' , II , 80 ; Jacob ben Asher 's Commentary ( ' Ba'al Ha-Turim ' ) to Ex. xx . 18 ; note of Moses Isserles to ' Orah Hayyim 46 , 1 and Magen ' Abhraham ad loc. ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendentious work of S. Piker : ' Tephillah Ba-'Aretz ' , Jer. 1962 , pp. 232-244 . It is well-known that the Hasidic movement which arose in the latter half of the eighteenth century attached the greatest significance to prayer . A very comprehensive anthology of the more important early Hasidic teachings on prayer is contained in ' Sepher Ba'al Shem Tobh ' , Sotmar , 1943 , in the section to Noah , pp. 118 fl : , from which the following is taken . The worshipper should give all his strength to the words he utters in prayer , proceeding from letter to letter until he forgets his bodily sensations . The Ba'al Shem attained to his knowledge of the higher worlds not because of his learning but because he prayed at all times with the profoundest inwardness and concentration . Even when man prays with great love and fear he should be humble at the same time . Man should remember God in all that he does . Even when he is about to enter the privy he should think to himself that he is about to separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the good which remains after the evil has been removed . It once happened that the prosecutor presented his case before the heavenly court , claiming that Jews were prepared to be distracted by petty business matters even on their way to pray in the Synagogue . The defence had no reply until the Ba'al Shem acknowledged the justice of the prosecutor 's plea but added that it was also true that once a Jew has carried out a mitzwah , a divine precept , he would not sell it for all the money in the world . A little Torah study before prayer helps to prepare the mind for its devotions but too much study can be detrimental to prayer if it has the effect of exhausting the mind . The worshipper should learn to assess for himself the delicate balance in this matter . The true worshipper should be ready to put so much of himself into his prayers that it should only be by a  | miracle that he can recite them without expiring on the spot . When a man has reached but a humble stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the prayer book which will assist him in his devotions . But once he has reached the /stage of attachment to the upper world he should recite his pr-'yers with closed eyes that he be not distracted even by the praye ook . Sometimes a man finds that he can not pray with deep co. emplation . He should then content himself with the thought that God 's glory fills all worlds and that God is near to him . When man begins to pray it should be with the fear of God in his heart for this is the gateway to God 's presence . He should say to himself : ' To whom do I wish to cleave ? It is to the Creator by whose word all things were made , who brought all things into being and who sustains them all ' . He should concentrate on God 's greatness and majesty and he will then be equipped to enter the higher worlds . The person afflicted with a melancholy disposition imagines that he prays with the fear of God . Similarly , a sanguine man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But both these are spurious states . The fear of God descends upon man without any effort on man 's part . As a result of such dread he no longer is aware of himself and his tears flow of their own accord . Only that love of God which stems from this kind of fear is true love of God . The man who says that he will pray with devotion and inwardness only on the Sabbath is like the king 's servant who is only prepared to serve his master in his presence . A man should get into the habit of ' shouting to God in silence ' i.e. he should put all his strength into profound concentration without necessarily giving his cry any external expression . Whenever ' strange thoughts ' ( i.e. extraneous thoughts ) enter man 's mind during prayer he should experience a sense of great shame for he has been expelled from the royal palace . With great embarrassment he should seek to return to the palace with an overwhelming sense of his unworthiness . On the other hand , he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange thought ' but should shatter it and cleave to God . By so doing he redeems the ' holy spark ' present in every ' strange thought ' . When man suffers , the Shekhinah suffers with him . Consequently , one 's prayers on behalf of a neighbour in trouble should be intended for the Shekhinah who grieves with the neighbour . ' He will fulfil the desire of them that fear Him ; He will also hear their cry , and will save them ' ( Ps. cxlv. 19 ) . The Ba'al Shun interpreted this verse as follows . A man may pray for something he believes is good for him but may find it harmful when the request has been granted . He should not then be ashamed to entreat God to help him , even though the harm is , as it were , of his own making , since God ' hears  | their cry and saves them ' . When man has prayed in fear of God the fear that is awakened can lead to anger . Similarly , when he has prayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead him to illicit loves . The antidote is for man to engage in work or study as soon as possible after his prayers . If man feels joyful after his prayers he should know that his prayers have been answered . These and other elevated thoughts in the Ba'al Shem and his followers ' system must not be allowed to blind us to the fact that the whole system is based on the Qabbalistic belief in the thaumarturgic power of the words of prayer . Written in the sacred tongue by divinely inspired authors , the very letters of the prayer book , it was held , contained far more than their plain meaning as symbols representing human needs and human ideas . The letters were , in fact , combinations of divine names and their utterance had the power of bringing down the flow of divine grace from above . For this purpose profound inwardness and concentration were required . To utter the words of prayer without concentration , said the Ba'al Shem ( op. cit. pp. 128-9 ) , was spiritual masturbation . The divine seed was thereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early Hasidic thought without a realisation of its occult and semi-magical nature . It is not difficult to produce an anthology of beautiful Hasidic tales and maxims on the subject of prayer , but to do this without reference to the system as a whole is to present a half-truth . To say this is not , of course , to deny that the modern Jew can find spiritual help in Hasidic devotional doctrine even if he can not accept some of the basic ideas of the movement . Most of the material we have quoted , for example , is capable of being applied in his prayer life by the devout modern since the early Hasidic masters were true adepts in prayer . On the meaning of worship for the Jew of today v. Chapter 34 : The Meaning of Observance ' in Abraham J. Heschel 's God in Search of Man ' , John Calder , London , 1956 , p. 348 f . Heschel defines a mitzvah as a sacred deed where earth and heaven meet ' . It is ' a deed in the form of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . All Mitzwoth are means of evoking in us the awareness of living in the neighbourhood of God , of living in the holy dimension . They call to mind the inconspicuous mystery of things and acts , and are reminders of our being the stewards , rather than the landlords of the universe ; reminders of the fact that man does not live in a spiritual wilderness , that every act of man is an encounter of the human and the holy ' . On the question discussed in the text of God 's need of human worship cf. Maimonides " Guide ' , III . 13 . Cf. Heschel 's recent book : Torah Min Ha-Shamayim , Vol . I , Soncino Press , London , 1962 , pp. 76 f ,  | ( 2 ) God is not to be worshipped thro h an intermediary . This principle does not nece ' sarily state that there are no intermediaries , only that these are not to be worshipped . It is clear , for instance , that throughout the Biblical and Rabbinic periods the majority of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence of angels through whom God , as it were , carries out His work . Philo , it is well-known , believed in the divine word , the Logos , through which God creates and controls the world . It is , however , of much interest that in the whole of the Mishnah , the great compendium of Jewish teaching compiled by Rabbi Judah the Prince at the end of the second century , there is no reference to angels . The argument from silence is always a precarious one . It is not certain that scholars like David Neumark who see this as a conscious protest against a belief in angels are correct . But there is unanimity in the sources that the angels and other intermediaries , even if they do exist , are not to be worshipped . There can be little doubt that Maimonides ' insistence on this principle is in conscious reaction to the Christian doctrine of the Incarnation and prayers to and through Jesus . Maimonides is emphatic that prayers are not to be offered to angels but departures from this are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , angels are entreated to offer prayer to God on man 's behalf . Part of the objection to the Hasidic movement by its opponents was to the doctrine of the Tzaddiq , the Hasidic saint and leader , to whom his followers ' petitions were addressed in the first instance in the belief that the holy man 's prayers would be more acceptable to God . The opponents of the movement saw in this a breach in the idea that God is to be approached directly and that He is near to all who call upon Him in truth . It is generally held that the Palestinian teachers in Talmudic times had , on the whole , a more refined faith than their Babylonian colleagues . There is far less emphasis , for instance , on a belief in demons in the Palestinian than in the Babylonian Talmud . With regard to the use of angels as intermediaries , scholars like Louis Ginzberg see a fundamental difference in approach between the two centres of Jewish life . Thus we read in the Palestinian Talmud : R. Judah said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a patron stands at the door awaiting  | the answer the servants will bring , whether or not he will be permitted to approach him for aid . But he who needs God 's help ought not to ask the assistance of either Michael or Gabriel or any other angel , but should turn immediately to God : for whosoever shall call on the name of God will be delivered " ' . ( Jer . Ber. ix , 13a ) . In the Babylonian Talmud , on the other hand , we read : He who prays in the Aramaic language will not be helped by the ministering angels , for the ministering angels do not know Aramaic ' ( Sabb. 12b ) . However , it is more than a little difficult to accept this as different attitudes on the part of the Palestinian and Babylonian authorities since the Babylonian Talmud quotes the saying in the name of the famous Palestinian teacher , R. Johanan . It is by no means far-fetched to understand the passage in the Babylonian Talmud as referring to the angels carrying the prayers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that as it may , here and there in the Jewish liturgy one does find prayers to angels and , although these scandalised Rabbinic authorities , protests against them appear to have been of no avail . It would be erroneous to conclude , therefore , that Jewish life knows nothing of intercessors . Even a kind of saint cult is not unknown , the ceremonies at the grave of Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai at Meron in Israel on Lag Ba-'Omer , for instance . In other parts of the Jewish world , too , it is not unknown for candles to be burned at the tombs of holy men and for petitions to be thrown into the tomb through a special aperture for the purpose . Two things , however , can safely be said . The first is that all these activities would without doubt have been considered extremely offensive by a teacher like Maimonides and would have been construed by him as a breach of his fifth article of faith . The second is that even in its crudest and most superstitious phases the cult of the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . EXCURSUS On the idea of an intermediary in Judaism v.

Cohen 's ' Everyman 's Talmud ' , Dent , London , 1949 , pp. 47 ? 58 . In the latter work there is an anthology of Rabbinic ideas on angels . The only place in the prayer book in which angels are designated by name is the night prayer , which reads : ' In the name of the Lord , the God of Israel , may Michael be at my right hand , Gabriel at my left , before me Uriel , behind me Raphael , and above my head the divine presence of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ' Ha-Derashoth Be-Tisrael ' , Jer. 1947 , p. 546 , note 100 , gives some of the sources on the Rabbinic opposition to the invocation of angels . The thirteenth century Jacob Anatoli in his ' Maimed Ha-Talmidim ' , Lyck , 1866 , p. 68a , in his commentary to the second commandment , observes that this implies a prohibition against the invocation of angels . He attacks the custom obtaining in ' some places ' of reciting the prayer calling upon the angels to bring the prayers of Israel to God ? makhnise rahamim . Anatoli says that in the prayers of Moses and the other prophets and in the statutory Synagogal prayers there is not the slightest trace of prayers to angels . The difficulty of Jacob 's prayer ( Gen. xlviii . 16 ) is answered in two ways : ( 1 ) The meaning of the verse is : ' God who sent His angel to redeem me ' or ( 2 ) The term ' angel ' here refers to the ' will of God ' . Cf. R. Isaac ben Shesheth ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrongly in JE as 159 ) . The Responsum deals with the question of the propriety of the Qabbalistic doctrine of the Sephiroth and whether it is right to pray to them . Ribash quotes his teacher , R. Peretz Ha-Kohen , who never spoke of the Sephiroth and never thought of them . R. Peretz further told of R. Samson of Chinon , ' the greatest of his generation ' , who used to say that he prayed ' like a child ' , namely , not as the Qabbalists with their complicated prayers , now to one Sephirah , now to another . The Qabbalists interpret the Rabbinic saying : ' He who desires wisdom should face south when praying and he who desires wealth should face north ' as referring to the requisite Sephiroth . All this , observes Ribash , is very strange to the non-Qabbalist , who suspects a dualism here . He once heard , he says , someone influenced by philosophy ( ' ehad min ha-mithpalsephim ) attack the Qabbalists on the grounds that while the Christians believe in ' three ' the Qabbalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ribash describes a meeting he had with the elderly sage , Don Joseph Ibn Shoshan , who is described as a Talmudic sage , familiar with philosophy , and a great Qabbalist and saint . Ribash put to him the question : how can the Qabbalists have one Sephirah in mind when reciting one benediction and a different Sephirah in mind when reciting another benediction ? Is it not  | forbidden for a Jew to pray to the Sephiroth , thereby suggesting that they are deities ? Don Joseph replied that , of course , the prayer of the Qabbalist is directed to the Cause of causes but concentration on the different Sephiroth can be compared to a petition presented to a king in which the monarch is requested to command that the suppliant 's wish be carried out through the lord appointed for that purpose . Thus when the Qabbalist thinks of the Sephirah of ' Lovingkindness ' , when praying for the righteous , and the Sephirah of ' Power ' when praying for the downfall of the wicked , his intention is to pray to God to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ingenuity of the reply but expresses his dissatisfaction with it . Surely , he argues , it is far better to pray to God with simple intention without appearing to advise Him how to grant the bequest ! Ribash concludes that he personally favours simple , unsophisticated concentration in prayer . This does not mean that Ribash rejects the Qabbalistic system but , as he remarks in this Responsum , since he has not had the advantage of learning the system at the feet of a master he prefers to avoid the subject .

IX , 1958 , ' The Kavvanoth of Prayer in Early Hasidism ' , pp. 163-192 . Cf. a discussion of this topic from the standpoint of orthodox Qabbalism in Menahem Mendel of Lubavitch 's ' Derekh Mitzwothekha ' , Poltava , 1911 , pp. 234 if .

There was a good deal of Rabbinic opposition in the last century to the custom in Palestine of visiting the grave of R. Simeon b . Yohai on the thirty-third day of the ' Omer , the traditional anniversary of his death ( as mentioned above ) , to offer prayers and to burn valuable garments !

From the days of the great Hebrew prophets who fought against idolatry there has been determined opposition in  | Judaism to any image of God or any kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is abhodali zarah , literally , strange worship ' . It embraces both the worship of heathen deities and the worship of an idol as God or as the image of God . On the whole , hardly any attempt is made , in the classical Jewish sources , to distinguish between different kinds of pagan or primitive worship such as animism , fetishism and polytheism . All forms of worship that are not purely monotheistic as well as any type of representation of the divine are treated together as idolatry and severely condemned . Maimonides devotes a whole section of his great Code to the prohibition of idolatry . His remarks in the first chapter of this section ( Hal . Abhodah Zarah , Chapter I ) are worth quoting for the light they shed on Jewish thinking on idolatry in the Middle Ages . It hardly needs stating that Maimonides was working with the facts as known to him . He can not be expected to have known modern anthropological studies or to have anticipated the findings of comparative religion , so that some of his conclusions on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( It might be noted , however , that Maimonides in his Guide for the Perplexed ' was the first scholar to attempt a systematic presentation of Biblical prohibitions in the light of contemporary idolatrous practices . With sure instinct , Maimonides was the first to see fully that many of the Biblical regulations can only be understood against their background . In this he influenced John Spencer who acknowledges , indeed , his debt to the great mediaeval thinker . Spencer , in turn , influenced both Robertson Smith and James Fraser , so that Maimonides , as we have noted later , has been heralded , with some justice , as the real founder of comparative religion ) . In the days of Enosh ' ( v. Gen. iv . 26 ) , writes Maimonides , men fell into great error and the counsel of the sages of that generation was exceedingly foolish , Enosh himself belonging to those who went astray . The following was the nature of their error . They argued thus : Since God created the spheres and stars to control therewith the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and since they are servants who minister in God 's presence , it is only right to praise them and glorify them and accord them honour . It must be the will of God , those people argued , that men should aggran-  | dize and pay homage to those He has honoured , just as a king desires homage to be paid to his ministers so that to carry out this wish is to honour the king himself . No sooner had they reasoned in this way than they began to erect temples to the stars and to offer sacrifices to them , and they began to sing praises and hymns to them and bow down to them , in order to fulfil , according to their base reasoning , the will of the Creator . This was the chief idea behind idolatry and this is how the idolators who knew this idea argued . They did not argue that apart from this star there is no God . Hence Jeremiah says : " Who would not fear Thee , 0 King of the nations ? For it befitteth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nations , and in all their royalty , There is none like unto Thee . But they are altogether brutish and foolish : The vanities by which they are instructed are but a stock " ( Jer. x. 7 ? 8 ) . The prophet means to imply : All know that Thou art alone but their error and folly consists in imagining that this vanity is Thy will ' . Maimonides continues : After some time had elapsed false prophets arose among the children of men who claimed that God had spoken to them commanding that a certain star , or all stars , should be worshipped and that libations and sacrifices be offered to the star which is worshipped and that a temple be erected to it with representations of its form , in order that all the people might bow down before it ? the women and children and all other ignorant people . The false prophet would furthermore impart to them an image of the star he had himself invented , saying to them : This is the image of such-and-such a star which has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images in temples and under trees , at the tops of mountains and upon the hills . There they would gather to bow down to the images and they would proclaim to all the people that this image has the power of doing good and evil and it is therefore right to worship and fear it . Their priests would inform them that as a result of their worship they would increase and prosper and they would order the people to worship in this manner and not in that . Other liars arose who claimed that the star , sphere , or angel itself , ordered them to worship it in such-and-such a manner . And the false prophet would thus instruct the people to worship in this  | manner and not in that . Eventually , this I ea spread to the whole world , that images should be ' wor hipped in diverse ways and that men ought to offer sacrifices to them and bow down before them . In the course of time the glorious and fearful Name was forgotten from mouth and mind of all creatures so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people and their women and children knew only of the image of wood and stone and the temple of stone in which they had been trained from infancy to bow down to the image , to worship it and to swear in its name . As for the sages among them , the priests for example , they imagined that there was no other god than the stars and spheres in whose honour the images had been fashioned . But the Rock of Ages remained unknown and unrecognised except to a few individuals such as Enoch and Methuselah , Noah , Shem and Eber . This is how human history developed until the birth of Abraham our father , the pillar of the world ' . No sooner was this mighty man weaned than , child though he was , his mind began to probe . Day and night he engaged in reflection , expressing his astonishment that the sphere should move without cause or controller since it could not have caused itself . Submerged as he was among the foolish idolators of Ur of the Chaldees , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother as well as the rest of the people worshipped idols and he followed them . But all the time his mind was probing and deepening in understanding until he attained to the proper way and grasped the truth by his own correct discernment . He then realised that there is only one God who controls the sphere . He created the world and there is no other god in all creation . Abraham then realised that all the world was in error , an error brought about by star and image worship until the truth had been lost . Abraham was forty years of age when he recognised his Creator . At once he began to refute the theories of the Chaldeans and to argue with them that their way was untrue . Breaking the images , he began to make it known that God alone is to be worshipped and that only to Him is it right to bow down , to sacrifice and to offer libations that all creatures of the future might know Him , breaking all the images to pieces that people might not be led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no God . When Abraham 's proofs began to convince others the king sought to murder him , but a miracle happened and he escaped to Haran . Here he began to proclaim to the whole world that there is only one God for all mankind and that He is to be worshipped . Thus would he wander from town to town and from kingdom to kingdom , gathering the people together and proclaiming the truth to them , until he reached the land of Canaan , as it is said : " And called there on the name of the Lord , the everlasting God " ( Gen. xxi. 33 ) ' . Maimonides concludes this chapter with an account of how Abraham handed down these truths to Isaac and Jacob and how the people of Israel came into being , to whom Moses disclosed the true way in which God is to be worshipped and idolatry rejected . Maimonides is , of course , recording here the traditional Jewish view , based chiefly on Rabbinic legend , that Abraham was the first great iconoclast with his descendants continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biblical times the fight was directed against the pagan deities of Egypt , Canaan , Babylonia and Assyria . In later , Rabbinic , times the protest was against the worship of the Greek and Roman pantheon , a whole tractate of the Mishnah and Gemara , tractate Abhodah Zarah , being devoted to this theme . Maimonides ' definition of idolatry ( Hil . A.Z. II . 1 ) reads : ' The chief command with regard to idolatry is that one should not worship any creature , neither angel nor sphere nor star , neither one of the four elements nor anything formed from them . Even if the worshipper knows that the Lord is God and he only worships this creature in the manner in which Enosh and his contemporaries worshipped at first , he is still an idolator . The Torah warns us against this when it says : " And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven , and when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars .. . which the Lord thy God hath allotted unto all the peoples " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might observe that these control the world and that the Lord has allotted them to all mankind that men might live and that they suffer no decomposition , and you might conclude from this that it is right and proper to bow down to them and to worship them . It is in connection with this matter that the Torah enjoins : " Take heed to yourselves , lest your heart be deceived " ( Deut. xi . 16 ) , that is to  | say , you should not be led astray through the reflections of your heart to worship these to serve as intermediaries between you and your Creator ' . Opposition to anything which savoured of idolatry was very fierce during the period of the second Temple . Josephus ( Ant . xviii . 3. 1 ) tells us that when Hadrian introduced the Roman ensigns into Jerusalem the protest was such that he was compelled to withdraw them . Some idea of the way in which the Talmudic sages viewed idolatry is to be gleaned from the Mishnah of which , as we have seen , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days before Gentile festivals it was forbidden to have business dealings with them ( A.Z.I.1 ) . It was forbidden to sell articles to Gentiles before their festivals which they might use in idolatrous worship , e.g. fir-cones , white figs , frankincense or a white cock ( A.Z. I. 6 ) . Wine of Gentiles and certain of their foods were forbidden ( A.Z. II and V ) . However , we are told that Rabban Gamaliel in Acre bathed in the Bath of Aphrodite because the Gentiles do not say : Let us make a bath for Aphrodite ' but Let us make an Aphrodite as an adornment for the bath ' ( A.Z. III . 4 ) . There are many references in the Talmudic literature to the prohibition of casting a stone at a Merqolis ( e.g. Sanh . VIII . 7 , A.Z. IV . I ) which appears to have been a pillar to Mercury , the Greek Hermes , who was the patron deity of travellers at whose shrine the grateful passers-by cast a stone . It is said that the Jewish elders were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He hates them so . To this they replied that men worship the sun , moon and stars and God refuses to destroy the world He has created because of fools ' . If , on the other hand , He were to destroy only those idols of which the world has no use this would only confirm the worshippers of those which were not destroyed that these alone have power ( A.Z. IV . ' 7 ) . Among further details , numerous in the extreme , of Rabbinic abhorrence of idolatry , the following might be mentioned . R. Menahem b . R. Simai was given the appellation the son of the holy ' because he refused to gaze even upon the image on a coin ( A.Z. 50a ) . Not alone was idolatry itself treated with the greatest severity by the Rabbis but anything appertaining to it was strictly prohibited ( ' abizraihu ) . Thus it was forbidden to use the leaves of an idolatrous grove ( ' asherah ) even if the  | leaves were used for their medicinal properties , so that any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jer . A.Z. 2.5 ) . The high priest in Temple times did not wear the garments of gold when he entered the holy of holies ( v. Ex. xxviii. 6 f. and Lev . xvi . 4 ) because these might serve as a reminder of the golden calf and a prosecutor can not act as a defender ' ( R. H. 26a ) . Some later authorities infer from this that it is forbidden to write prayers on paper used previously for idolatrous books even if the original writing has been erased ( Toreh Deah , 139. 14 ) . If an idol has been desecrated ( i.e. by defacing it ) by its worshipper it is permitted to have use of it ( Tos . A.Z. VI , A.Z. 52a ) but this only applies to an idol belonging to a Gentile . The idol of a Jew is permanently forbidden even after its defacement by the owner ( ibid . ) . R. Nahman said that although obscene scoffing is generally forbidden it is permitted when directed against idolatry ( Meg. 25b ) . If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been uprooted he should say : Blessed be He who uprooted idolatry from our land ; and as it has been uprooted from this place , so might it be uprooted from all places belonging to Israel ; and do Thou turn the heart of those that serve them to serve Thee ' ( Ber. 57b ) . Although the intention of committing a sin is not counted a sin this does not apply to idolatry where even the mere thought of worshipping idols is accounted sin ( Qidd. 40a , Ber. 12b ) . The Rabbis were not unaware that the older pagan cults had lost much of their force , hence the saying of R. Johanan that Gentiles outside Palestine are not true idolators but simply continue in the customs of their ancestors ( Hull 13b ) . EXCURSUS On idolatry in the Biblical period v. Ludwig Blau 's article in JE , Vol . XII , pp. 568 ? 9 and Yehezkel Kaufmann 's massive Toledoth Ha-'Emunah Ha-Yisraelith ' , Tel-Aviv , 1937 f. , now translated into English in an abridged form by Moshe Greenberg , University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith of Israel was monotheistic from the beginning , i.e. from the time of Moses , but on the Biblical view the universalistic God could only be worshipped properly in the holy land . Furthermore , it is only Israel He wishes to reject idolatry . The other nations ' are permitted  | by Him to worship idols . Kaufmann 's views are stimulating but it is doubtful whether he has proved his case . Cf. Edmond Jacob : ' Theology of the Old Testament ' , Hodder and Stoughton , London , 1958 : ' The invective of the prophets against the gods of the nations are not motivated by hate or arrogance , but by the convictions that these gods are powerless to grant to the nations the place to which they have a right in the order of creation ; with still more reason these gods could not be of any help to members of the people of Israel who committed the folly of forsaking Yahweh to put themselves under their protection ' ( p. 67 ) . Rabbinic teachings on the severity of idolatry are legion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Ned . 25a , cf. Hor. 8a ) . Such a person is treated as a mumar ( apostate ) to the whole Torah so that any act of ritual slaughter he carries out is invalid ( Hull . 5a ) . The prohibition of idolatry is one of the ' seven precepts of the sons of Noah ' i.e. and is , therefore , binding upon Gentiles as well as Jews . The Shulhan ' Arukh , Yoreh De'ah , 179 , records the prohibitions associated with idolatry and idolatrous practices . Following earlier Rabbinic teachings , it rules that there is a prohibition against consulting astrologers . Under certain circumstances , however , it is permitted to utter incantations , not because these are really efficacious but because of their psychological value to one who believes in them . Here the Shulhan ' Arukh follows Maimonides , v. his Commentary to the Mishnah A.Z. IV . Cf. the well-known and very interesting stricture of Maimonides contained in the note of the Vilna Gaon ( S.A. ad loc. , Biur Ha-Gra , note 13 ) who points to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maimonides was misled by ' philosophy ' to interpret these in an over-rational spirit . The whole subject is a very complicated one . Despite determined efforts on the part of Rabbinic authorities to root out superstitious practices some of these gained a foothold in Jewish life , v. Joshua Trachtenberg 's ' Jewish Magic and Superstition ' , New York , 1939 and H. J. Zimmels : ' Magicians , Theologians and Doctors ' , Goldston , London , 1952 ; S. Rubin : ' Geschichte der Aberglauber ' , Vienna , 1887 . Reference should here be made to the bold interpretation of the Kotzker Rabbi to Deut. iv . 23 : ' Take heed unto yourselves , lest ye forget the covenant of the Lord your God , which He made with you , and make you a graven image , even the likeness of any thing which the Lord thy God hath commanded thee ' . The Kotzker interprets this to mean that man should not make an idol of a command of God ! V. M. Buber : ' Tales of the Hasidim ' , Vol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , p. 279 . Rabbi A. I. Kook , the late Chief Rabbi of Palestine , has an interesting observation on the impulse to man 's self-worship which leads  | him to a denial of God . According to Kook ( ' Oroth Ha-Qodesh ' , 2 Vol. , ed . D. Cohen , Jer. 1938 , Vol. 2 , pp. 411 ? 412 ) there is sometimes to be found deep in the heart of man a bizarre form of envy ? envy of God . Man in the wretchedness of his finite situation and human plight envies God His infinite nature and bliss . This leads , among other things , to a denial of God and a deification of man . There are two antidotes , remarks Kook , to this poison , the first intellectual , the second moral . The intellectual antidote consists in the recognition that the difference between God and the world depends on degrees of comprehension . The greater man 's comprehension of truth the fuller will be his comprehension that God is in all , that the happiness and well-being of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since all have their source in God . The moral antidote is to be found by the man who freely develops his own nature so that of his own accord he longs for the triumph of justice and righteousness in the world . Man 's free longing is then in accord with the true nature of reality and there is no longer any reason for envy of the divine . According to Rabbi Schneor Zalman of Liady idolatry is not a denial of God but an attempt at insubordination . Man desires to have a little corner of life apart from God 's all-embracing power and the idols he sets up are his means of effecting the separation he desires between God and that part of life man wishes to call completely his own . For its worshippers the idol becomes an ultimate instead of the true ultimate , God . Hence , for the Rabbis , pride is equal to idolatry because both commit the same offence of insubordination . ' Pride is equal to idolatry in very truth . For the main root principle of idolatry consists in man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart and separate from God 's holiness , and is not complete denial of God ' ( ' Tanya ' , ed . Vilna , 1930 , Chapter 22 , p. 55 , v. J. B. Agus in ' Sepher Ha-Shanah ' , Vol . VIII ? IX , New York , 1946 , p. 273 ) .  | M AIMONIDES ( Abelson 's translation ) thus expresses the sixth principle of the faith : The sixth principle of Faith . Prophecy . This implies that it should be known that among this human species there exist persons of very intellectual natures and possessing much perfection . Their souls are predisposed for receiving the form of the intellect . Then this human intellect joins itself with the active intellect , and an exalted emanation is shed upon them . These are the prophets . This is prophecy , and this is its meaning . The complete elucidation of this principle of faith would be very long , and it is not our purpose to bring proofs for every principle or to elucidate the means of comprehending them , for this affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a passing mention only . The verses of the Torah which testify concerning the prophecy of prophets are many ' . The Tigdal ' formulation reads : The rich gift ( shepha ' ) of his prophecy He gave to the men of His choice , in whom He gloried ' . The " Ani Ma'amin ' formulation is : I believe with perfect faith that all the words of the prophets are true ' . Friedlander says : In the sixth principle we declare our belief in the fact that the Almighty has communicated His Will to human beings , although we are incapable of forming a clear and definite idea of the manner in which such communication took place . The selection of the individual for the office of a prophet , as well as of the time , the place , and the object of the Divine communication , is dependent solely on the Will of God , whose Wisdom and Plan no mortals are able to fathom . We know only that Malachi closed the series of Prophets , but are ignorant of the reason why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Lord " . Mankind is , however , not altogether deprived of the benefit of prophecy ; the holy  | book need only be opened , and the message of the prophets is heard once more ' . Werblowsky has this to say : This article is plainly meant as the methodological premise of the validity of the actual , concrete Jewish religion . God communicates with man . Maimonides would even hold that prophecy is not a free divine charisma but is merely the technical term for the highest level of communion with God arrived at through the intellectual love of God . Other thinkers would distinguish between communion with God , various types of illumination and the very specific charisma of prophecy . According to Yehudah Halevi the capacity for prophecy is an innate hereditary characteristic of the Jewish people ; his conception is almost biological , and involves the notion of a spiritual super-race . Modern liberal theologians tend to dilute the conception of prophecy to the rather vague idea of inspiration or " progressive revelation " or " worship of the divine in the hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the history of modern liberal religion and to none of the great religions in their historic forms . As the article stands it does not specify the nature and function of prophecy . It merely asserts that the words of the prophets as handed down to us , are true . It does not even raise the question by what criteria true prophecy can be distinguished from false . This problem is treated in the Bible as well as in Talmudic and later literature ' . It should first of all be noted that in Maimonides ' formulation the emphasis is on the possibility of that form of communication between God and man known as prophecy . Naturally Maimonides would wish to call attention to the classical prophets and the truth of their message . In this he is at one with the author of the " Ani Ma'amin ' formulation . But it seems clear from Maimonides ' discussion of prophecy in his other works that prophecy is possible even after the close of the Canon and that even in his own day a man could become a prophet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Friedlander observes , has it that prophecy came to an end in Israel after the Biblical prophets but there was an equally widely held view that it would be restored , to usher in the Messianic age , during the thirteenth century , i.e. possibly during Maimonides ' own lifetime .  | It should be noted further , as Werblowsky states , that for Maimonides no special divine gift is involved in prophecy . Any human being who makes the necessary efforts and who is endowed with the requisite moral , intellectual and physical qualities can become a prophet . To the scandal of many subsequent teachers Maimonides goes so far as to write that , far from prophecy being in any way miraculous , the miracle is that , on occasion , one who has attained the stage of prophecy may be prevented by God from becoming a prophet . Here Maimonides is at complete variance with Yehudah Ha-Levi who considers prophecy to be an innate faculty of the Jewish soul . Only a Jew can become a prophet because , through his ancestry , he possesses the special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparation , by God 's grace . Maimonides was fascinated by the problem of prophecy all his life . Already in his youth he had promised to write a work on the subject which he actually began but did not finish . Many of his views on prophecy are , however , to be found in the work of his old age , his Guide for the Perplexed ' . A. J. Heschel may well be right in claiming that Maimonides ' interest in the subject was more than academic and that he came to believe not only that the prophetic vision would be restored in his day but that he personally had attained to it , in its lower stages , on rare occasions in his life . A section of the Guide ' ( II . 32 ? 48 ) is devoted to the theme of prophecy . Maimonides quotes here three opinions about prophecy among believers in God . Non-believers , who reject the belief in God , will naturally reject the existence of the prophetic faculty . The ignorant , says Maimonides , imagine that God simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No qualifications are necessary , other than those of moral goodness , since no one maintains that a wicked person can be a prophet . The philosophers ( i.e. the Arabic Aristotelians ) , on the other hand , hold that anyone who attains intellectual and moral perfection must become a prophet . It is not at all a question of divine grace but of human capacity and attainment . It is as impossible that a man who is capable of prophecy not to attain it as it is for a healthy person to be fed well without assimilating his food . Maimonides accepts the view of the philosophers with but one qualification . His reading of  | Scripture convinces him that only certain persons are chosen to be prophets . This he explains , as stated , by suggesting that God may withold prophecy from one suited to attain it by means of a miracle . An interesting feature of the Maimonidean view of prophecy is the role played by the imagination . The prophetic vision comes through the intellect but strong imaginative powers are required before it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an emanation sent forth by the Divine Being through the medium of the active intellect , in the first instance to man 's rational faculty , and then to his imaginative faculty ; it is the highest degree and greatest perfection man can attain ; it consists in the most perfect development of the imaginative faculty ' ( II . 36 ) . When the vision comes to the prophet he trembles greatly and his senses cease to act ( II . 41 ) . The descriptions in the Bible of the prophets performing bizarre acts are to be understood as part of their vision . They saw , in a vision , that they performed those acts . Isaiah did not really go about naked ( Is. xx . 3 ) , Jeremiah did not really hide his girdle ( Jer. xiii . 4 ? 7 ) in the Euphrates , nor did Ezekiel carry out any of the acts he is saidto have performed , except in avision . God forbid to assume that God would make his prophets appear as objects of ridicule and sport in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolish acts ' ( I I. 46 ) . The reference to the active intellect ' has to be understood as follows . In the view of the Arabic Aristotelians , whose views here Maimonides relies on , there are ten Intelligences , that is to say , ten immaterial beings through which God exercises His control of the universe . Each of these has a sphere allotted to it . The lowest of these is known as the active intellect ' ( sekhel ha po'el ) . Its sphere is the material world and the human soul is derived from it . At first , however , in man , his soul depends on his body . His rational faculties require to be developed . As they develop by means of intellectual perception the potential soul becomes actual . It is possible for a man so to develop his soul that it gradually frees itself of the body to become reunited with the active intellect ' whence it originated . When this takes place man has attained to the degree of prophecy . Thus , anyone who makes the effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | tive endowments must prophesy since the active intellect ' is bound to do its work , unless , as Maimonides stipulates , God prevents this by a miracle . Far different is the view of Yehudah Ha-Levi . Ha-Levi denies that prophecy is a natural process but looks upon it as a gift from God . Nor is intellectual perfection essential to the attainment of the prophetic vision . Furthermore , prophecy is confined to the Jewish race so that even a convert to Judaism can not be a prophet . H. A. Wolfson has pointed out that this ' nationalistic ' view is not found at all clearly in the Rabbinic sources ( in fact , there are in those sources references to prophets of the nations ) but is found , oddly enough , at first in Christian sources . The Church Fathers do speak occasionally of prophecy as confined to the Jewish people , probably to enable them to transfer it , after the rejection of Jesus by the Jews , exclusively to Christians . Secondly , in Ha-Levi 's view geographical as well as biological considerations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of prophets , reaching from Adam through Seth , Enosh , Noah , Shem , Abraham , Isaac and Jacob down to the members of the Jewish race , and he must reside in the holy land . ( Ha-Levi 's references to prophecy are scattered throughout his Kuzari ' but v. especially : I. 47 , 95 , 115 ; II . 14 , 49 ; III . 1,5 , 11 , 23 ; V. 21 ) . Hasdai Crescas occupies a midway position between Maimonides and Ha-Levi . Disagreeing with Maimonides ' view that prophecy is natural ' and a matter of human training in the main , Crescas agrees with Ha-Levi that only Jews can become prophets . But it is not due to a special mystic , almost biological , faculty that prophecy is limited to Jews but because the type of moral training required can only be provided by the Torah , the possession of the Jewish people . ( ' Or ' Adonai ' , Part II , Chapter 4 , ed . Vienna , 1859 , p. 46a ) . Other Jewish thinkers take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 1 ) objects to his statement that the events recorded of the prophets did not really take place but were part of the prophetic vision . Gersonides ( ' Milhamoth ' , II . 6 ) and Albo ( " Iggarim ' , III . 8 ) are critical of the role allotted by Maimonides to the imaginative faculty in prophecy . Moses Hayyim Luzzatto in his Derekh ' Adonai ' leans heavily on his predecessors , particularly on Maimonides and the  | Qabbalah , in his description of the prophetic faculty . Luzzatto ( III . 3. par . 4 ) defines the prophetic experience as a cleaving to God ' . As a result of this attachment the prophet acquires a superhuman insight . The prophetic experience is thus described ( III . 3. par . 6 ) : When God reveals Himself to the prophet and pours out on him His influence the prophet is seized by a tremendous power ; his material form and bodily organs tremble and feel as if they are about to be overcome . For it belongs to the nature of matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still less the revelation of God 's glory . The prophet 's senses become numb and even his psychic faculties no longer operate automatically but become dependent on God and on His influence which pours down on to him ' . Luzzatto goes on to say that the prophet acquires superhuman knowledge as a result of his experience and this remains with him even after his return to normality . It is not necessary , says Luzzatto ( III . 4. par . 6 ) for a prophet to be sent with a message from God to His people . The essence of prophecy is attachment to God but it is sometimes incidental to the prophetic experience that , God delivers to the prophet a message to others which he is then obliged to carry to them . On the literary side of the prophecy , Luzzatto ( III . 4. par . 8 ) remarks that a prophet may attain to superhuman knowledge of some matter which he then puts into words of his own choosing . But the great literary prophets , whose prophecy concerns future generations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very words belonging to the content of their message , even though these are mediated through the personality of the prophet . The discussions among the classical Jewish writers on the nature of prophecy are of interest but the results of modern investigations are at least as important and probably more rewarding . Nor are any particular views of the nature of the prophetic experience relevant to the theological question of what is involved in the acceptance of the sixth principle of faith . Many Jews today would be prepared to argue , with plausibility , that not being prophets ourselves we can not hope to comprehend the exact nature of the prophetic experience . But for all that , we acknowledge the sacredness of Scripture with its record of revelation to and through the prophets and we  | see that however these men received their revelation , their message concerning the God who demands holiness , justice and mercy in human affairs contains the highest demands made upon man . Consequently , we accept the sixth principle of faith as a principle of revelation . This is far different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Werblowsky speaks ) that Isaiah was inspired as Shakespeare was inspired . The tendency in a good deal of present-day theological thinking attempts to do justice to the unique character of Scripture as the ' word of God ' without failing to recognise the human element in revelation . In fact , thousands of devoted modern scholars have shed new light on the Biblical record and the idea of prophecy and their findings are indispensable for a proper appraisal of what the Bible actually says concerning the prophetic experience . Some of these views we must now examine but although this kind of investigation is important , and must be pursued as rigorously and as objectively as possible , we can approach it as religious Jews with a completely free attitude of mind . For , after all has been said , there remains an element of mystery about the prophetic experience and the words of the prophets still speak , as do no other , to the human situation . EXCURSUS It should be noted in any discussion of the role of the prophets from the Jewish point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revelation so that the Rabbis could say that if Israel had not sinned no further revelation through prophets and kethublzim would have been required ( Ned . 22b ) . No prophet was able to make any innovations , since the revelation to Moses was complete ( Sabb. 104a , Meg. 2b ) . Cf. on this theme G. F. Moore , ' Judaism ' , Harvard University Press , 1958 , Vol . I , pp. 239 f . An excellent survey of Rabbinic and mediaeval views on prophecy is that of Emil G. Hirsch in JE , Vol . X , pp. 215 ? 219 . Cf. the index under ' Prophecy ' in I. Husik 's ' A History of Mediaeval Jewish Philosophy ' , Philadelphia , 1940 . For Maimonides ' views on prophecy the best works are : Z. Diesendruck : ' Maimonides Lehre von der Prophetie ' in ' Jewish Studies in Memory of Israel Abrahams ' , New York , 1927 , pp. 74-148 ; H. A. Wolfson : ' Hallevi and Maimonides on Prophecy ' in JQR , New Series , Vol. 32 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 49 ? 82 ; A. J. Heschel : ' Ha-He ' emin Ha-  | Rambam She-Zakhah Li-Nebhu'ah ' in the Louis Ginzberg Jubilee Volume , Heb. sec. , New York , 1946 , pp. 159-188 . Abraham Abulafia ( b. 1240 ) was greatly influenced by Maimonides and became the author of prophetical writings through which he made many enemies , v. G. Scholem : ' Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism ' , London , Thames and Hudson , London , 1955 , pp. 126-155 . On Crescas v. S. B. Urbach : The Philosophic Teachings of Rabbi Hasdai Crescas ' ( Hebrew ) ' Jer. 1961 , Chapter 8 , pp. 249-272 . Albo 's views on prophecy are to be found in his ' Iqqarim ' , Book III , Chapters 8-12 , ed . I Husik , Philadelphia , 1946 , Vol . III , pp. 64 f . Albo ( III.9 ) deals with the question of how God reveals Himself to different prophets in different ways . Quoting Ber . R. 4 Albo says that just as a man 's form is seen differently in mirrors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prophets under many and various forms according to the brightness and purity of the media , though God Himself does not multiply or change . Hence the Rabbis say : Many prophets have one idea , though no two prophets use the same expression ' ( Sanh. 89a ) . Albo ( III . 11 ) agrees that prophecy is only possible in the holy land and among the Jewish people but his reason for this opinion is novel . The illumination which comes to the prophet derives from the Shekhinah which rested upon the ark and the tablets of stone , like a spark of sunlight reflected in a mirror . The prophet who had in him a certain preparation analogous to the contents of the ark , namely , who had really made the Torah ideas his own , was able to receive this reflected glory . It follows that prophecy could only be found among Israel in the holy land since the two conditions of the ark and the Torah personality were required . The term nabhi occurs as a noun with the meaning of a prophet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as more than one hundred and ten times in verbal form . It is used of Abraham ( Gen. xx . 7 ) , Aaron ( Ex. vii . 1 ) , Moses , Miriam ( Ex. xv . 20 ) , of Elijah and Elisha and the great literary prophets . What is the history of the term ? Part of the difficulty in attempting to answer this question belongs to the problem of dating the various Biblical books . For instance , the well-known text we shall now consider from the book of Samuel would be more helpful to the investigation if we could determine the exact date when it was recorded and this we can not do . In the first book of Samuel it is told how Saul ,  | searching for the lost asses of his father , decided to ask Samuel where they were to be found . It appears from the narrative that one of the functions of the prophet , here called a ro'eh ( seer ' ) , was to assist people by means of his clairvoyant powers . As a gloss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 9 ) states : Beforetime in Israel , when a man went to inquire of God , thus he said : " Come and let us go to the seer ( ro'eh ) " ; for he that is now called a prophet ( nabhi ) was beforetime called a seer ( ro'eh ) ' . It would seem from this that a development took place in the role and functions of the prophet , that in earlier times he was called a ro'eh , with the emphasis on his clairvoyant powers , and later he assumed the role of nabhi . But , apart from the problem of chronology to which we have referred , it appears from the use of the term ro'eh of later prophets that it is precarious to infer any hard and fast or clear-cut distinction between the two types of prophet . Be that as it may , it is important to consider the function of the nabhi on the basis of the evidence presented by the Bible itself and the study of this evidence against the general background of ancient Near Eastern cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nebhi'im , is distinguished by his strangeness and the unusual nature of his dress . He is said to have worn a girdle of leather about his loins ' ( I Kings i. 8 ) . This strangeness of the nabhi , setting him apart from his fellows as a man infused with God 's spirit ( ruah ) is repeatedly implied in many Scriptural passages . Of great significance are the references to the sons of the prophets ' ( bene ha-nebhi'im ) i.e. the aspirants for the role of nabhi who would gather round a nabhi to learn his methods ( v. II Kings ii . 3 , iv . 1 ) . The prophets resorted to music ( II Kings iii . 15 ) and dancing ( I Kings xviii . 26 ) in order to awaken the spirit . Although this last verse refers to the false prophets ' it is significant that the term nabhi is used in Scripture of both the prophets of God and the prophets of Baal . This only confirms what we know from the picture of Near Eastern religion in ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phenomenon of " nebhi'ism " was not confined to Israel and that in Israel itself there were sufficient common characteristics between true and false prophets to justify the use of the same term for both . This leads to the question of whether it is legitimate to  | speak of the prophets as ecstatics ' , on which there has been so much discussion in recent years . The older view was that the very word nabhi came from a root meaning to bubble forth ' and was held as referring to the pouring forth of words in a frenzy of ecstasy or even to foaming at the mouth in a kind of fit . This view has now been generally abandoned . Many moderns prefer , following in this some of the mediaeval Jewish commentators , to understand the root meaning of nabhi as signifying to call ' . There is , in fact , an Akkadian root nabu meaning to call ' . The meaning of the term nabhi according to this would be one who calls ' , one who has a message to deliver ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , understands the term to mean one who has received " a call " ' . ( H. Wheeler Robinson : Inspiration and Revelation in the Old Testament ' , Clarendon Press , 1946 , page 173 , note 1 , with justice , however , says that this seems to import too much theology ' into what must have been a primitive term ) . Much depends on what is meant by ecstatic ' in this connection . If by ecstatic ' is meant abnormal ' behaviour it is difficult to see how it can be ignored that the nebhi'im did engage in such behaviour . But if by ecstatic ' is meant the kind of phenomena associated with the mystics we are on more shaky ground . J. Muilenburg ( Peake 's Commentary on the Bible ' , ed . Matthew Black and H. H. Rowley , Thomas Nelson and Sons , London , 1962 , pp. 475 ? 483 ) rightly says that there is no clear instance anywhere in the whole of the prophetic literature of the personality of the prophet being effaced . Consequently , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with caution of the prophets although it perhaps best describes the type of phenomenon we have been considering . In recent years , too , there has been a great deal of discussion on the role of the cultic prophets ' . Abandoning the older view of a severe conflict between prophet and priest , modern scholars , on the analogy of Near Eastern patterns as revealed in cultic texts and on the many hints in the Bible itself ( e.g. I Kings i. 34 , Nathan the prophet and Zadok the priest ; II Kings xxiii. 2 ; Is. xxviii. 7 ; Lam. ii . 20 ; Jer. xxiii ) , have argued with considerable conviction for the existence of cultic prophets in ancient Israel . A further question to be considered before examining the role of the great classical prophets ' or literary prophets ' is  | the nature of the false prophets ' . How did these differ from the true prophets ? The difference between the two on the Biblical evidence appears to be that the false prophets ( who may have been cultic prophets ) told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of speaking to their conscience as did the true prophets . The false prophets speak of peace where there is no peace ' ( Jer. vi . 14 , Ez. xiii . 10 and 16 ) . In Buber 's words , the true prophets were Realpolitiker ' , the false prophets Illusionpolitiker ' . The whole of the thirteenth chapter of Ezekiel is important in this connection . Here it is stated that the false prophets say the Lord saith ' whereas He had not , in fact , sent them ( Ezek. xiii . 6 ) . They engaged not in the Lord 's battle and failed to repair the hedges ( Ezek. xiii . 5 ) . The picture we have in the Bible of conditions before the rise of the literary prophets is that of bands of nebhi'im , probably grouped in some way around the shrines , who were the spokesmen of God . Some of these were true ' prophets , serving as the conscience of the nation , others were false ' prophets , failing to remind the people of God 's demand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resembling the ecstatic state . The important question now to be considered is the precise relationship between the older groups of nebhi'im and the great classical ' prophets . The classical prophets may also have been ecstatics , though this element is definitely played down in the Scriptural descriptions of their character and work . Were the great classical prophets , Amos , Hosea , Isaiah , Jeremiah and Ezekiel , members of a prophetic guild , distinguished from other nebhi'im only by the special quality of their message , or did they belong to an entirely different type of prophet ? In the light of the evidence it is by no means easy to answer this question . A good deal turns on the precise meaning of Amos vii . 14-15 , the famous declaration of the first of the literary prophets : Then answered Amos , and said to Amaziah : " I was no nabhi , neither was I a ben nabhi ( ' son of a nabhi ' , i.e. disciple of a nabhi ) ; but I was a herdman , and a dresser of sycamore-trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Lord said unto me : Go , prophesy unto My people Israel " ' . Does Amos mean that he was not a nabhi until God called him ( i.e. as he had no prophetic ambitions he had not joined a prophetic  | guild ) but now that he has been called he is a nabhi ? Or does he mean that he is no nabhi but someone whom God has called for a special purpose ( the Hebrew bears both meanings ) ? If the second interpretation is correct it may well be that in the great classical prophets we have a completely new type of messenger from God to the people , called nebhi'im only by analogy with the members of the prophetic guild . However , it will not do to overstress the differences in character between the earlier nebhi'im and the later classical ' prophets . The latter grew out of the former and it is not at all surprising to find many features common to both . Perhaps the most remarkable thing to be observed of the classical prophets is the assurance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . The lion hath roared ' , says Amos , who will not fear ? The Lord God hath spoken , who can but prophesy ? ' ( Amos iii . 8 ) . Isaiah tells of the Lord speaking to him with a strong hand ' ( Is. viii . 11 ) . Jeremiah tells how the Lord put His words into his mouth ( Jer. i. 9 ) and how God imparted to him words of fire ( Jer. xxiii. 29 ) . The book of Ezekiel contains a vivid description of how God 's message comes to the prophet so that he is compelled to speak ( Ezek. iii ) . The message which comes to the prophet is , in the first instance , to his contemporaries and it frequently has to do with future events . It is consequently too superficial to draw the common distinction between forthtellers ' and ' foretellers ' and to claim that the classical prophets belonged only to the former group . There is an element of prediction in the work of the classical prophets , too , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future arising out of the present rather than a distant , unrelated future . The foretelling ' aspect , so common in Near Eastern prophecy and in Greek , is by no means absent from Israelite prophecy . However , detailed prognostication of events hidden in the future is alien to the Hebrew prophets ( the second part of Isaiah is , on these grounds and others , generally considered by scholars to belong to another prophet , the prophet of exile ' ) . But , seeing as they did the hand of God in human history , the prophets described for their people their insight into the way in which human history unfolds itself pregnant with God 's purpose . Very few will consult the prophets today in order to read modern political  | events out of the ancient pages . The significance of the prophets lies in the unique way in which they teach that God is the Lord of history . Professor Muilenburg ( op. cit. ) has put this most effectively : The Hebrew prophets tower head and shoulders over their contemporaries both in ancient Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sages and psalmists have their distinctive place in the life and religion of Israel , but none rise to the stature of the prophets or continue to exercise so major an influence on subsequent history . Whether we view them in the light of the phenomenology of religion or in the context of human culture or in the frame of the history of literature , they occupy a position in the thought and faith of mankind unmatched by any other single group . They belong to their own times , but are not confined by them ; they are in many way typical members of their race , yet they often transcend the characteristic features of their Semitic cultural heritage and environment . They address themselves to the needs and crises of the ancient world of men in which they lived , but their words continue to stir the conscience of men , to call them to responsibility , to assert the claims of the divine imperative ' . EXCURSUS The best survey of modern literature on the ecstatic nature of Hebrew prophecy is that of H. H. Rowley : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Study ' in the Harvard Theological Review , Vol . XXXVIII , 1945 , pp. 1-38 . Rowley quotes Wheeler Robinson who prefers to speak of abnormal experience ' since the term ecstasy ' rightly belongs to Greek psychology with its sharper distinction than the Hebrew between soul and body . Rowley ( p. 6 ) rightly observes that even if the term nabhi does have an etymology which suggests the idea of ecstasy , words have a history as well as a derivation , and the question is not what the word originally meant but what it came to represent . On the other hand there are undoubtedly abnormal behaviour patterns to be observed even among the great literary prophets , e.g. Isaiah walking naked in the streets , Jeremiah hiding his girdle , Ezekiel eating dung , the symbolic names given to Isaiah 's and Hosea 's children , which , as Rowley says , would seem a little hard on the children ' . We have seen that it was considerations of this sort that led Maimonides to deny that these events actually happened except in a vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in  | Festschrift Alfred Bertholet , Tubingen , 1950 , p. 327 , makes a famous distinction between two kinds of ecstasy . ' Absorption ecstasy ' belongs to the unio mystica but is not that of the prophet , whereas concentration ecstasy ' is that of the prophet . In ' concentration ecstasy ' there is an absolute concentration on an idea or group of ideas during which normal consciousness ceases to operate . Cf. The Prophets of Israel ' by Curt Kuhl , trans. by Rudolf J. Ehrlich and J. P. Smith , Oliver and Boyd , Edinburgh and London , 1960 , p. 20 . H. Wheeler Robinson : Inspiration and Revelation in the Old Testament ' , Oxford , Clarendon Press , 1946 , pp. 187 ? 198 : The Theological Validity of Prophecy ' , Chapter XIV , is helpful . Wheeler Robinson does well to remind us that : We may be so occupied with the psychological process that we forget the most important of all , that God in His own way , whatever that was , has brought to birth by human travail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 192 ) . Aage Bentzen ( Introduction to the Old Testament ' , 2nd. ed. , Copenhagen , 1952 , Vol . I , pp. 191 ? 202 , similarly argues that it is only a deficiency in modern man 's religious experience which brings him to label the prophetic experience as abnormal ' ; this is only another way of saying , as we have done , that one must be a prophet in order to understand fully the prophetic experience . It is certainly necessary ' , observes Bentzen ( p. 192 ) , ' to make it plain that the psychological condition of the prophets is not so abnormal ' as generally supposed . That word can only be used of the very exaggerated cases of ecstasy , which are , however , seldom ' . Bentzen ( p. 195 ) also makes the important point , for which he acknowledges his indebtedness to earlier scholars , particularly Lindblom , that the ecstatic style of the prophetic oracle demands frequently a rough language with the pictures chasing one another and resulting in grammatical incongruities . Thus it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slippery road of textual emendations ' . It should be noted that the ancient view did not see the prophets as abnormal . We have already noted Maimonides ' views in this connection . St. Jerome ( Introduction to Prophecy of Nahum , quoted by R. A. Knox : Enthusiasm ' , Oxford , Clarendon Press , 1957 , p. 35 ) states that the Old Testament prophets had all their wits about them . Yehezkel Kaufmann : The Religion of Israel ' , translated and abridged by Moshe Greenberg , University of Chicago Press , 1960 , is original on his ideas of Hebrew prophecy . Kaufmann points out ( p. 94 ) that in ancient Israel there was no science of oneirocriticism ? dream interpretation . The only two oneirocritics among the Biblical heroes are Joseph and Daniel and they both belong to the court of heathen kings . Even here the Bible assimilates the oneirocriticism to the word of God , it is God  | who inspires them to interpret the dream . Kaufmann notes ( pp. 92 ? 101 ) that all forms of Israelite prophecy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , an essential difference between the Israelite and pagan conceptions of prophecy . In pagan religion prophecy is regarded as deriving from a special mantic source of power . The prophet has the gift provided by this power either from birth or by acquisition . But in Israel the prophetic spirit comes upon ' the prophet and is in no way a native talent . The prophetic ideal of the Bible is Moses ( Deut. xxxiv. 10 ) and yet of him no ecstatic phenomena are related ( Kaufmann , pp. 98 ? 9 ) . A very important survey of the whole subject is that of O. Eissfeldt in The Old Testament and Modern Study ' , ed. by H. H. Rowley , Oxford , Clarendon Press , 1956 , pp. 115 ? 161 . V. the discussion on pp. 136 ? 145 on the religious evaluation of the prophetic message and particularly the quotation from Mowinckel on p. 141 : I am no longer primarily interested in unravelling the processes of the prophet 's psychological experiences , in discussing how far the factors hold good in general , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character and to assume the form of visions , auditions , etc. , etc. , etc . That is a task for the psychologist , and it is not the duty of a theologian to become a professional psychologist ' . A. J. Heschel 's work on the prophets , Die Prophetic ' , Krakow , 1936 , has attracted a good deal of attention . Heschel looks upon the prophet not as an ecstatic at all but as a special type of man sharing the divine pathos . In the sympathy they feel with this the prophets enter into the very experience of God Himself . In fact , according to Heschel , the sy7npatheticos is the exact opposite of the ecstatic . The prophetic state , as Heschel sees it , is a constant one , totally different from the tumultuous state of ecstasy which is for the moment . V. now Heschel 's book The Prophets ' , Jew . Pub . Soc. , Philadelphia , 1962 . Mowinckel ( The Old Testament as Word of God ' , trans. by Reidar B. Bjornard , Blackwell , Oxford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the word ' ( dabhar ) of the Lord which comes ' to the prophet . The Hebrew word dabhar means both word ' and thing ' . The more general sense in which dabhar is used of prophetic experience calls attention not so much to the word ' as to the thing ' , the prophetic dabhar , the prophetic thing ' , being a situation in which the prophet encounters God . As a result of this experience it becomes clear to him what it is that God would have him do  | and the nature of the message God would have him bring to his people . The confrontation with God is the thing of the Lord ' , the encounter with the divine , which imparts to the prophet superhuman powers of insight and perception so that he now observes the situation in which his people finds itself with a clarity quite beyond the normal ' human understanding . It is not so much that actual words are imparted to him as that he himself finds the suitable words to express his experience and the message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the experience , the nature of the message which results from it , which gives the experience its validation as a message from God . As Mowinckel ( quoted by Rowley , HTR , op. cit. , p. 36 , note 149 ) puts it : The content is the deciding factor , which makes the prophet 's experience an experience of God . The experience of an empty and more or less unutterable mysterium tremendum et fascinosum would not make the prophets essentially different from the common nabhi ; the ecstatic nebhi'im had purely " numinous " experiences , but these were of no value as revelations . What is merely " numinous " may just as well be " Baal " as Yahweh ; it may just as well be a " lying spirit " as the spirit of Yahweh , and of this the great prophets are fully aware . The content of an experience makes it an experience of Yahweh , or rather , proves that it is one . In other words , the certitude of the experience depends upon whether it has a definite content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by religious and moral standards ' . This point of view , and it has much to commend it as true to the account given of prophecy in the Biblical record , lies midway between the interpretation of prophecy as a simple experience of the numinous and that of verbal inspiration . It is the content of the experience , not the experience itself , which gives it its validation as coming from God , but it is not a case of divine dictation of the actual words in which the message is later conveyed . There is no question of verbal dictation to the prophet . The prophetic experience is not , to use Coleridge 's phrase , supernatural ventriloquism . If it were , it is difficult to see why each prophet expresses the vision he has seen in terms of his own cultural background , Amos as a herdman , Isaiah as a nobleman , and so forth . The prophet retains his individuality . Although the basic experience is more or less the same for all  | the prophets , the content is different , and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular application of his message . We have seen that Albo develops the illustration of a figure seen in different mirrors . Rowley ( op. cit. p. 30 ) uses the illustration of light passing through a piece of coloured glass where the light is from without yet coloured by the glass . Another problem of importance in connection with prophecy is that of the relationship between the prophetic experience and message and the actual record of it we now have in the prophetic books . Did the prophets themselves write the books which now appear under their name in the Bible ? Already in the famous Baraitha quoted in the Babylonian Talmud ( B. B. 14b ? 15a ) it is suggested that some of the prophetic books , at least , were edited by later teachers rather than written down by the prophets whose names they bear . Thus Hezekiah and his colleagues are said to have written the book of Isaiah and the Men of the Great Assembly the book of Ezekiel . Eissfeldt ( op. cit. p. 117 ) , in a survey of the whole question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countenance is now given to the theory that the prophets themselves put down in writing their individual oracles or collections of them . The stress is now on oral traditions , i.e. , the words of the master were treasured in the memories of his disciples and transmitted to later times by word of mouth . These sayings were enlarged and expanded from time to time . Only after the books had attained their final form in the oral tradition did writing take place so that the books named after the earlier prophets were not put down in writing until post-exilic times ( cf. Eissfeldt , op. cit , pp. 126 ? 134 ) . A rather less extreme view is taken by Curt Kuhl ( op. cit. , pp. 36-40 ) . Kuhl discusses the question , what is the relationship between the ipsissima verba of the prophets and the literary work in the Bible under their name ? He states that there are two opinions among modern scholars . ( 1 ) No literature was produced by the prophets themselves . The words of the prophets were handed down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in post-exilic times . In the course of transmission the material underwent certain modifications and addition , e.g. eschatological material was added . But the difficulty of this view is to account for the personal elements such as the  | autobiographical material . Why should this kind of material have been preserved as part of the oral tradition since the personal life of the prophet can not have had much relevance to the situation of posterity ? Furthermore the stress among certain modern scholars on oral traditions is based in part on the erroneous assumption that writing was virtually unknown in ancient Israel . ( 2 ) The prophet 's words were recorded in writing by his disciples . But various oracles were incorporated from other sources and adaptations were later made for the relevance to the contemporary situation in later times . If we keep in mind , concludes Kuhl , the glosses , the additions , the adaptations to the contemporary situation , as well as such things as textual corruptions , the discovery of the izsissima verba of the prophets is very difficult . But Kuhl calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the prophetic books . These were probably written by the prophet himself or by his disciples . For further understanding of this important question the following considerations should be noted . Autobiographical material is found in Isaiah vi . and viii ; Jeremiah i , ii and xxxvi ; Hosea i. 2 ? 9 and iii ; and Amos vii . The book of Ezekiel is entirely autobiographical . Isaiah ( xxx . 8 ) is told to write his message on a tablet and inscribe it in a book that it might endure . The same prophet is told to bind the testimony , seal the instruction among My disciples ' ( Is. viii . 16 ) . This may well suggest that at first the prophet 's words were recorded , either by himself or by his disciples , and that at some later date the various messages , given at different times , were gathered together . In the collected sayings of the prophet the editors may have incorporated pieces from other sources . This is the most probable explanation of passages duplicated in the books of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prophetic vision of war being banished from earth is found in almost identical words in the book of Micah ( iv . 1 f. ) and Isaiah ( ii . 2 f . ) . It is also possible , however , that one prophet is quoting from the other , or they may both be quoting from another source . It is interesting to note that we find in two prophetic books virtually identical messages but directed in each case against a different nation . A good example of this is the comparison of Isaiah against Egypt ( xxxi. 8 ) with  | Ezekiel against Tyre ( xxviii. 2 ) , where both prophets scornfully declare that the nations to which their prophecies are directed are men and not God ' . Further remarkable duplications in the work of two prophets are : Obadiah 's prediction of Edom 's downfall couched in the identical words of Jeremiah 's prediction of the same event ( Jer. x1ix. 7 f. ) and Isaiah 's burden of Moab ' ( Is. xv ) compared with that of Jeremiah ( Jer. xlviii ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the zpsissima verba of the prophets is and how difficult it is to answer with any degree of certainty the question of how the books as we know them came to assume their present form . In a generation greatly interested in psychology it is but natural to endeavour to investigate the psychological processes of the great classical prophets . We have touched upon this question earlier in our discussion . Attempts at psychoanalysing the prophets have been made and it can hardly be denied that a study of the autobiographical material in the prophetic books occasionally yields the picture of psychic abnormality . ( Cf. Rowley HTR , op. cit. pp. 24 f. and notes and pp. 27 f. and notes ) . Superficial investigators have sometimes permitted themselves to question the value of work produced by men whose psychological makeup was so different from our own . But , as William James observed long ago , the value of the pearl is not affected by the clinical description of a pearl as a disease in the oyster . The prophets are recognised as inspired men because of the timelessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has even argued that for a man to have windows to heaven he must be a little cracked ' in the head ! Which is only another way of saying that the prophets were abnormal ' because the average man is no prophet . No perceptive student of prophecy in Israel will compare the prophetic message with the rantings of a psychopath , if only because the resultant message of the prophets contains the ripest wisdom , the richest insight , and so deep an understanding of the human situation that generations of men have found it to be the word of God . To sum up , no violence whatsoever is done to our reason when we accept Maimonides ' sixth principle of the faith . However we understand , or fail to understand , the exact nature of the prophetic experience , however much we become  | aware of the human element in the experience itself and its transmission to us , however conscious we are of the great difficulty of knowing the ipsissima verba of the prophets , however strong our recognition that Hebrew prophecy has its roots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the succession of strange figures which emerged in ancient Israel , whom we call the prophets , brought a message , expressed now in deathless language , of God 's love for mankind and His demands of them of holiness , justice and mercy . As we have noted , Bishop Gore says in his profound book Belief in God ' ( Pelican Books ' , 1939 , pp. 79 ? 80 ) : Here , then , we find a succession of wonderful men , mostly conscious of profound unpopularity in their contemporary world , who nevertheless , even in the face of the most determined hostility of courts and people , delivered a message which we feel to be self-consistent and to involve the same great principles throughout , about God ? His nature , His will , His purposes ? and about human nature ? its dignity , its responsiblity , and its sin ; a message which they declare , with the fullest conviction , to be derived not from their own reasoning or speculation , nor from tradition ( though they would have indignantly repudiated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor from any external source at all , but from God , the God of Israel , speaking in their own souls , so intensely and clearly that there could be , no mistake about it ' . Of all the thirteen principles , this is probably the one which presents no difficulties whatsoever . For the words of the prophets are there for us and our descendants to read , and sensitive readers throughout the ages have accepted that these words are true because they have found the response to them in their own hearts and have recognised in them a challenge calling forth the highest of which they are capable . EXCURSUS Good bibliographies of modern works on the prophets are to be found in Eissfeldt , op. cit. , Rowley , HTR , op. cit. , and compiled by N. W. Porteous , in Kuhl , op. cit. , pp. 192 ? 196 . Martin Buber : The Prophetic Faith ' , translated from the Hebrew by Carlyle WittonDavies , Macmillan , New York , 1949 , is a penetrating interpretation of I-Iebrew prophecy . Cf. Studies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. Robinson , ed . H. H. Rowley and T. Clark , Edinburgh , 1950 ; Israel 's Prophetic Heritage ' ? Essays in honor of James Muilenberg , ed . Bernard W. Anderson and Walter Harrelson , Harper , New York , 1962 ; Introduction to the Old Testament ' by Artur Weiser , translated by Dorothea M. Barton , Darton , Longman and Todd , London , 1961 , section on : The Prophetic Saying ' , pp. 44 ? 50 . Of older works , two of the most important are The Prophets of Israel ' by W. Robinson Smith , 2nd. ed. , Adam and Charles Black , London , 1895 , and Prophecy and Religion ' by James Skinner , Cambridge University Press , 1930 . On the relationship between the earlier nebhi'im and the classical prophets Skinner 's words ( p. 4 note 1 ) are still relevant : The real point at issue , however , is whether a great and even sudden advance in religious enlightenment involves an absolute breach of continuity with the kind of experience which was admittedly characteristic of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the development of self-conscious reason in man from the rudimentary intelligence of the lower animals . The two are separated by an immeasurable chasm , so that the higher can never be explained in terms of the lower ; and yet the persistence of animal appetites and instincts in the mental life of man proves conclusively that somehow it has sprung from that of the animals . Similarly in the spiritual prophecy of the Old Testament we find traces of ecstasy , visions and auditions , which are obviously survivals of states of consciousness belonging to prophecy of a lower grade . And the fact that the great prophets far surpassed their predecessors in their apprehension of religious truth is no reason for denying the reality of the ecstatic element in their experience , or for explaining it away as a mere rhetorical accommodation to traditional modes of expression ' . A profound study of the prophetic experience is that of Adolphe Lods : The Prophets and the Rise of Judaism ' , translated by S. H. Hooke , Kegan Paul , London , 1937 . On the question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 57 ) : It would be necessary to disregard the evidence of history , and to forget the instances of Paul , Mahommed , Luther , Pascal , in order to maintain that a tendency to ecstasy is incompatible with a sane and vigorous mind . According to modern psychology , hallucination is nothing but the awakening of a memory with particular intensity : what the ecstatic sees and hears in trance is the expression of his personality : it is the fruit , perhaps ripened in unconsciousness , of his reflections , of his previous religious experiences , of the deep tendencies of his whole being , rising to the threshold of consciousness like something which appears to him to come from outside himself ' . Lods notes that both Hosea and  | Jeremiah were called madmen ' by their contemporaries ( Hos. ix . 7 ; Jer. xxix. 26 ) as had been the sons of the prophets ' in the time of Elisha ( II Kings ix . 11 ) . The characteristic mark of the great prophets is their conviction that they are interpreters and instruments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question of the characteristics of the great prophets v. H. Wheeler Robinson : Inspiration and Revelation in the Old Testament ' , Clarendon Press , Oxford , 1946 , pp. 164-172 . Here three important implications of the prophet 's call are noted : ( a ) God takes the initiative . The prophet feels himself compelled to undertake his task against his will . The very opposite of magic is here seen since magic is the human attempt to coerce the divine . ( b ) There is an intimate association of the prophet with God . Thus , in the prophetic books the of the prophet is frequently interchangeable with the I ' of God . ( c ) The word of God becomes as it were depersonalised ' with an objective power of its own . The prophet is quite unlike an author interested in questions of copyright ' and acquiring immortality ' through his work .  | M AIMONIDES devotes a great deal of space to the formulation of this principle . Here it is in Abelson 's translation : The seventh Principle of Faith . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must believe that he was the father of all the prophets before him and that those who came after him were all beneath him in rank . He ( Moses ) was chosen by God from the whole human kind . He comprehended more of God than any man in the past or future ever comprehended or will comprehend . And we must believe that he reached a state of exaltedness beyond the sphere of humanity , so that he attained to the angelic rank and became included in the order of the angels . There was no veil which he did not pierce . No material hindrance stood in his way , and no defect whether small or great mingled itself with him . The imaginative and sensual powers of his perceptive faculty were stripped from him . His desiderative power was still and he remained pure intellect only . It is in this significance that it is remarked of him that he discoursed with God without any angelic intermediary . ' We had it in our mind to explain this strange subject here and to unlock the secrets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " mouth to mouth " ; and the whole of this verse and other things belonging to the same theme . But I see that this theme is very subtle ; it would need abundant development and introductions and illustrations . The existence of angels would first have to be made clear and the distinction between their ranks and that of the Creator . The soul would have to be explained and all its powers . The circle would then grow wider until we should have to say a word about the forms which the prophets attribute to the Creator and the angels . The Shi'ur Qomah ( " divine measurements " ) and its meaning  | would have to enter into our survey . And even if this one subject were shortened into the narrowest compass it could not receive sufficient justice , even in a hundred pages . For this reason I shall leave it to its place , either in the book of the interpretation of the " discourses " , which I have promised , or in the book on prophecy which I have begun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these fundamental articles of faith ' . I shall now come back to the purpose of this seventh principle and say that the prophecy of Moses differs from that of all other prophets in four respects : ( 1 ) Whosoever the prophet , God spake not with him but by an intermediary . But Moses had no intermediary , as it is said ( Num. xii . 8 ) : " mouth to mouth did I speak with him " . ( 2 ) Every other prophet received his inspiration only when in a state of sleep , as it is asserted in various parts of Scripture , " in a dream of the night " ( Gen. xx . 3 ) , " in a dream of a vision of a night " ( Job xxxiii. 15 ) , and many other phrases with similar significance ; or in the day when deep sleep has fallen upon the prophet and his condition is that in which there is a removal of his sense-perceptions , and his mind is a blank like a sleep . This state is styled mahazeh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in visions of God " . But to Moses the word came in the day-time when " he was standing between the two cherubim " , as God had promised him in the words ( Ex. xxv. 22 ) : " And there I will meet with thee and I will commune with thee " . And God further said ( Num. xii . 6 ? 8 ) : " If there be a prophet among you , I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak unto him in a dream . My servant Moses is not so , who is faithful in all mine house . With him I will speak mouth to mouth ... " ( 3 ) When the inspiration comes to the prophet , although it is in a vision and by means of an angel , his strength becomes enfeebled , his physique becomes deranged . And very great terror falls upon him so that he is almost broken through it , as is illustrated in the case of Daniel . When Gabriel speaks to him in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " And there remained no strength in me ; for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption and I retained no strength " . And he further says ( Dan . x. 9 ) : " Then was I in a deep sleep on my face , and my  | face towards the ground " . And further ( Dan . x. 16 ) : " By the vision my sorrows are turned upon me " . But not so with Moses . The word came unto him and no confusion in any way overtook him , as we are told in the verse ( Ex. xxxiii. 1 1 ) : " And the Lord spoke unto Moses face unto face as a man speaketh unto his neighbour " . This means that just as no man feels disquieted when his neighbour talks with him , so he ( peace to him ! ) had no fright at the discourse of God , although it was face to face ; this being the case by reason of the strong bond uniting him with the intellect , as we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration came not at their own choice but by the will of God . The prophet at times waits a number of years without an inspiration reaching him . And it is sometimes asked of the prophet that he should communicate a message ( he has received ) , but the prophet waits some days or months before doing so or does not make it known at all . We have seen cases where the prophet prepares himself by enlivening his soul and purifying his spirit , as did Elisha in the incident when he declared ( II Kings iii . 15 ) : " But now bring me a minstrel ! " and then the inspiration came to him . He does not necessarily receive the inspiration at the time that he is ready for it . But Moses our teacher was able to say at whatsoever time he wished , " Stand , and I shall hear what God shall command concerning you " ( Num. ix . 8 ) . It is again said ( Lev . xvi . 2 ) : " Speak unto Aaron thy brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ; with reference to which verse the Talmud remarks that the prohibition ( " That he come not at all times " ) applies only to Aaron . But Moses may enter the sanctuary at all times ' . In the Yigdal formulation the seventh principle reads : There bath never yet arisen in Israel a prophet like unto Moses , one who hath beheld His similitude ' . In the ' Ani Ma'amin the form of the seventh principle is : I believe with perfect faith that the prophecy of Moses our teacher , peace be unto him , was true , and that he was chief of the prophets , both of those that preceded and of those that followed him ' . Friedlander puts the principles as follows : All that has been said with regard to the sixth article applies to the prophecy of Moses . There is , however , this distinction between the words of  | Moses and the words of other prophets : Whilst other prophets chiefly addressed their own generation , blaming their brethren for disobedience to the Divine Law , threatening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be made in the remote future , Moses addresses all times and generations , communicating to them laws " for all generations " , " everlasting statutes " , " the things which have been revealed for us and our children for ever " . He is therefore proclaimed by the Almighty as the greatest prophet ' . Werblowsky observes : The Superiority of the Prophecy of Moses . This is an intensification of the preceding article . It flows naturally from the position which the Pentateuch ( the " Law " ) occupied in Judaism in relation to the other books of the Bible . Whereas the prophetic books are " inspired " , the Pentateuch is God 's very Word , literally spoken or dictated to " my servant Moses " to whom God did not speak , as to all prophets , " in a vision or a dream " but " mouth to mouth , even apparently and not in dark speeches " ( Num. xii . 6-8 ) . For " the Lord spoke unto Moses face to face , as a man speaketh to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revelation to Moses is based the authoritative and binding character of the Law . His superiority as a prophet safeguards the Law from the possibility of abrogation by claimants to greater authority ' . The seventh article of faith is bound up with the question of the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch and the historical accuracy of the latter . These questions we shall be obliged to consider in the next chapter . Here we shall only touch on the problem insofar as it concerns the question of the historical Moses . Obviously the seventh article of the faith can have no meaning to those who believe that there was no such person as Moses . In the last century there were a number of scholars who questioned whether Moses ever existed , since our sole source of information about him is the Bible record and subsequent elaborations on it and these , at the very least , contain some legendary material . In a famous essay Ahad Ha-Am observed that he was unmoved by such speculations . Whether or not there was an historical figure called Moses was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who mattered , the Moses who was  | a potent force in the moulding of the Jewish character , was the ideal figure around which the legends had gathered . In present-day Biblical scholarship there has been a decided shift of opinion towards conservatism in this matter . Very few scholars are now prepared to deny either the historicity of Moses or his role as the true founder of Israel 's religion . For all the legendary accretions the details are far too circumstantial to admit of any explanation other than that there actually lived a great leader called Moses who imparted laws to his people , who led them out of bondage , and to whom later generations looked back as the founder figure in their history as a nation . There is nothing whatever in the historical facts to contradict such conclusions . There is , indeed , everything to support them . The modern believer will not fail to recognise that the records we have are less sober history than Hellsgeschichte , the sacred saga in which the historical events are retold . But he will also recognise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themes of the Exodus and the Revelation at Sinai . Furthermore , he will see in the sacred saga itself a continuation of the original events through which Israel encountered God , the way in which Israel read its own history and saw in it the finger of the Almighty . The modern believer will thus adopt a position midway between the complete acceptance of the Pentateuchal record as factual history and the view of thinkers like Ahad Ha-Am that it is all legendary material , or that it may be such , albeit of the greatest significance through its influence on Jewish life and thought . The difficulties in accepting the Pentateuch at face value will be dealt with in the next chapter . The difficulties of the Ahad Ha-Am position are no less severe for the believer than for the historian . Judaism is an historical faith and as such it must be grounded at least in events which actually transpired . A good deal of the very influence of which Ahad Ha-Am speaks is vitiated if the record is treated in terms of as if ? as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if the Decalogue was revealed to Moses . Our position is that the main events actually did happen ( though it is frequently difficult to disentangle the historical facts from the later elaborations ) , that God really did reveal Himself to His servant Moses , but that the record as we have it is not a contemporaneous account of those events but a saga  | in which they are retold , composed by pious Israelites , at different times in their history , as they reflected on the way in which God delivered His people and gave them His Law . If we suppose , for instance , that a group of devout believers wished to retell the story of Dunkirk in terms of God 's miraculous acts through which He saved mankind from the horrors of Hitlerism , naturally they would not treat the events as would the factual historian . They would highlight certain events , they might sing special hymns of praise to the heroic little boats which snatched the soldiers out of the jaws of death and captivity . They might perhaps exaggerate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the might of the foe in terms unwarranted by the evidence . If we then imagine that the resulting saga was added to from time to time and that later events in which the devout saw God 's hand were somehow fitted into the picture , we have some idea of how a record can be at one and the same time grounded in actual events and yet partake of the nature of a fictitious narrative . The biographical details in the Rabbinic Midrash , for instance , concerning Moses are generally recognised to be no factual records of real events in Moses ' life ( though , of course , they may contain much ancient material , some of it even going back to the days of Moses ) but the use of the ancient hero and his life as pegs on which to hang ideas and principles which the Rabbis felt to be relevant and valuable for their own day and a natural consequence of Moses ' teaching for their day . Thus if the Rabbis in the Midrash describe anachronistically the complaints of Korah against Moses in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story of the widow who was deprived of her tithes by Moses and Aaron ) , they must have been aware that these were not actually put forward by the ancient rebel to the ancient lawgiver but were examples of rebels against religious authority in their own day . We do not go to the Rabbinic Midrash so much for information about Moses as for information about how the character of Moses made its impression on the Midrashic interpreters themselves . It is certainly unconventional to suggest that this kind of Midrashic ' material is found in the Pentateuchal record itself but this is the only point of view which does justice both to the facts of history and the demands of religious belief and conviction .  | A further aspect of the question must also be noted . David Neumark ( ' Toledoth Ha-Iggarim Be-Yisrael ' , Vol . I , Odessa , 1912 , Vol . II , Odessa , 1919 , particularly , Vol . II , Chapter 8 , pp. 82 fl. ) has pointed out that the attitude of Jewish teachers towards the personality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christianity and Islam towards their Founders . Thus , according to Neumark , the term Mosheh Rabenu ' ( ' Moses our teacher ' or Moses our master ' ) , found so frequently in the Rabbinic literature , came into use as a conscious reaction against the term Master ' as applied to Jesus ( v. Acts ii . 36 ) . On the other hand , Neumark claims , the Mishnah plays down ' , in some measure , the significance of Moses in order to avoid the impression that any human being occupies the central role in God 's revelation to man . As examples Neumark quotes the Mishnaic denial that the hands of Moses had anything to do with Israel 's victory ( R.H. III . 8 ) and the Mishnaic claim ( Qidd . IV . 14 ) that , long before Moses , Abraham kept the whole Torah . Furthermore , the term Mosheh Rabenu , so frequent in other Tannaitic sources ( e.g. Siphre , Num. 157 , Deut. 1 1 , 12 , 25 , 29 , Tos . A.Z. 3 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mishnah . This is more than an argument from silence since the Mishnah on one occasion uses the otherwise unknown term Mosheh Ha-Tzaddiq ' ( ' Moses the Just ' ) as a substitute for the term Mosheh Rabenu ' found in a parallel Tannaitic source ( v. Mishnah Ned . III and Gem . 31b ) . In Maimonides ' day , however , it was necessary to elevate the personality of Moses . The danger of attaching any kind of divinity to the great leader had passed . On the contrary , the challenge now to be faced was that of an implicit denigration of his role in comparison with those of Jesus and Mohammed . It appears that Maimonides was especially influenced by the role Mohammed occupies in Islam . It was essential , Maimonides appears to argue , for Moses to be put forward as the greatest of the prophets . It is not surprising if in his zeal for the honour of the Torah Maimonides goes occasionally beyond his sources . Thus , for Maimonides , as in the formulation of the seventh principle , Moses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every detail is irrelevant . In the nature of the case there can be no direct evidence of the kind of influence Neumark attempts to see . It is clear , nonetheless , that in the seventh  | principle we do not have so much a definite theological formulation as a challenge to contemporary viewpoints of danger to Judaism . If we attempt to summarise the implications of the seventh principle in the light of Jewish history something of the following emerges . Moses is an historical figure . He was chosen by God to reveal His will to His people . Moses led God 's people out of bondage . But Moses was a human being with no divine claims whatsoever . Furthermore , the status of Moses as God 's messenger remains unaffected by the rise of Christianity and Islam . None of these propositions run counter to the facts . On the contrary , they afford the best explanation of the facts as we know them . There is no reason , therefore , for a rejection by the modern Jew of this principle of faith . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mediaeval Jew on the extent of Moses ' role , particularly on the contents of God 's revelation to Moses , but this has to do with the eighth principle concerning the Torah ( to be considered in the next chapter ) rather than the seventh . EXCURSUS George A. Barton in JE , Vol . IX , p. 56 , gives an impressive list of modern scholars who hold not only to the reality of Moses as an historical figure but to the reality of his work , though , of course , they differ in matters of detail . They include Wellhausen , W. R. Smith , Kittel , Cornill and Budde . For the verdict of more recent scholarship v. the 1959 ed. of the EB , Vol. 15 , pp. 838 ? 9 ( article by S. A. Cook and T. H. Robinson ) : Yet , with all this doubt , the fact remains that Moses stands out as one of the greatest figures in history ' . It is generally recognised by Biblical scholars that Freud 's interpretation in Moses and Monotheism ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The best treatment of the whole subject from the modern point of view is Martin Buber 's Moses ' , East and West Library , Oxford , 1947 . V. Buber 's fine description ( p. 8 ) of the qualities and activities peculiar to the God of Moses : He is the One who brings His own out , He is their leader and advance guard ; prince of the people , legislator and the sender of a great message . He acts on the level of history on the peoples and between the peoples . What He aims at and cares for is a people . He makes His demand that the people shall be entirely " His " people , a " holy " people ; that means , a people whose entire life is hallowed by H  | justice and loyalty , a people for God and for the world . And He is and does all this as a manifesting , addressing and revealing God . He is invisible and " lets Himself be seen " , whatever may be the natural phenomena or historical process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on any given occasion . He makes His word known to the men He summons , in such a fashion that it bursts forth in them and they become His " mouth " . He lets His spirit possess the one whom He has chosen , and in this and through this lets him make the work divine . That Moses experiences Him in this fashion and serves Him accordingly is what has set that man apart as a living and effective force at all times ; and that is what places him thus apart in our own day , which possibly requires him more than any earlier day has ever done ' . Especially important is Buber 's distinction ( pp. 13 ? 19 ) between the ' saga ' and ' history ' . The ' saga ' is not history but it is not fiction either . It follows in the footsteps of the historical events and describes the impact they had . Creative memory is at work in the saga . But the saga is not simply a matter of group psychology . We can get behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact on the people that they could only explain these events as of divine power at work in them . It is not a case of ' historization of myth ' as of ' mythization of history ' . At the same time , in the Moses saga , the ' mythical ' element is not a myth of the gods . The human figure is not transfigured , so that the element of sober historical recording is still present . But it should also be noted that the saga is itself of historical value since this was how the original events made their impact . In other words , Ahad Ha-Am 's position is far too extreme . There was an historical Moses but the later legends told of him also belong to creative historical appreciation . As Buber puts it : ' The Moses who had his being long ago is properly expanded by the one who has come into being in the course of long ages ' .

Among the legendary material in the Moses saga is the story of the finding of Moses with its remarkable parallel to the story of Sargon , v. JE , loc. cit. , and Pritchard ANET , p. 119 . Another interpretation of the role of Moses is the ' existential ' one of Andre Neher in the ' Men of Wisdom ' Series , translated by Irene Marinoff , Longmans , Green , London , 1959 .

Israel Lipschutz , in his Commentary to the Mishnah , Tiphereth Tisrael , end of Qidd. , note 77 , tells the following legend of Moses without stating his source . A certain king , hearing of Moses ' fame , sent a renowned painter to portray Moses ' features . On the painter 's return with the portrait the king showed it to his sages , who unanimously proclaimed that the features portrayed were those of a degenerate . The astonished king journeyed to the camp of Moses and observed for himself that the portrait did not lie . Moses admitted that the sages were right and that he had been given from birth many evil traits of character but that he had held them under control and succeeded in conquering them . This , the narrative concludes , was Moses ' greatness , that in spite of his tremendous handicaps he managed to become the man of God . It is well-known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polish Rabbis wished to issue a ban on the further publication of this legend as a denigration of Moses ' character . Cf. Ginzberg Legends ' , Vol . V , p. 403 , note 68 , for further references to the legend and for parallels . V. Siphre to Deut. xxxiv. 10 where it is stated that no prophet arose in Israel like Moses but among the nations of the world there did arise one like Moses . In fact ; the Siphre suggests that in the matter of the knowledge of God Balaam was superior to Moses . This statement of the Siphre , so embarrassing to later Jewish teachers , is , in fact , qualified by the Siphre itself , wherein it is said that Balaam is to be compared to the king 's butcher who is more conversant with the king 's expense account for food than the king 's minister .

Similarly , they both await the dusk , the eagle to hide , the bat to fly . Both Moses and Balaam were conversant with the times of God 's grace and anger but they used their knowledge for different purposes , Moses to bless Israel , Balaam to curse them .  | MAIMONIDES ' statement of the eighth principle of the faith is as follows ( in Abelson 's translation with the exception of the word mehoqeq which Abelson gives as lawgiver ' but which , it is clear , Maimonides is using in the sense of copyist ' ) : The eighth principle of faith . That the Torah has been revealed from heaven . This implies our belief that the whole of this Torah found in our hands this day is the Torah that was handed down by Moses and that it is all of divine origin . By this I mean that the whole of the Torah came unto him from before God in a manner which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of that communication is unknown to everybody except to Moses ( peace to him ! ) to whom it came . In handing down the Torah , Moses was like a scribe writing from dictation the whole of it , its chronicles , its narratives and its precepts . It is in this sense that he is termed mehoqeq ( = " copyist " ) . And there is no difference between verses like " And the sons of Ham were Cush and Mizraim , Phut and Canaan " ( Gen. x. 6. ) , or " And his wife 's name was Mehetabel , daughter of Matred " ( Gen. xxxvi. 39 ) , or " And Timna was concubine " ( Gen. xxvi. 12 ) , and verses like " I am the Lord thy God " ( Ex. xx . 2 ) , and " Hear , 0 Israel " ( Deut. vi . 4 ) . They are all equally of divine origin and all belong to " The Law of God which is perfect , pure , holy , and true " . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the greatest of all infidels because he thought that in the Torah there were a kernel and a husk , and that these histories and anecdotes have no value and emanate from Moses . This is the significance of the expression " The Torah does not come from heaven " , which , say the Rabbis ( Sanh. 99a ) , is the remark of one who believes that all the Torah is of divine origin save a certain verse which ( says he ) was not spoken by God but by Moses himself . And  | of such a one the verse says " For he bath despised the word of the Lord " ( Num. xv . 31 ) . May God be exalted far above and beyond the speech of the infidels ! For truly in every letter of the Torah there reside wise maxims and admirable truths for him to whom God has given understanding . You can not grasp the uttermost bounds of its wisdom . " It is larger in measure than the earth , and wider than the sea " ( Job xi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the footsteps of the anointed one of the God of Jacob , who prayed " Open my eyes and I shall behold wonderful things from thy Law " ( Ps. cxix. 18 ) . The interpretation of traditional law is in like manner of divine origin . And that which we know today of the nature of Sukkah , Lulab , Shophar , Fringes , and Phylacteries is essentially the same as that which God commanded Moses , and which the latter told us . In the success of his mission Moses realised the mission of a ne'eman ( a faithful servant of God ) ( Num. xii . 7 ) . The text in which the eighth principle of faith is indicated is : " Hereby ye shall know that the Lord bath sent me to do all these works ; for I have not done them of mine own mind " ( Num. xvi . 28 ) : In the Yigdal formulation the eighth principle reads : The Law of truth God gave unto His people by the hand of his prophet who was faithful in his house ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with perfect faith that the whole Law now in our possession , is the same that was given to Moses our teacher , peace be unto him ' . Friedlander states the eighth principle in these words : The whole Torah , including both history and precepts , is of Divine origin ; nothing is contained in the Torah that was not revealed to Moses by the Almighty , although we do not know in what manner Moses received the information . The history of preceding generations was probably handed down to his time by tradition : in fact it may have been contained in documents then extant , as is likely to have been the case with the various genealogies mentioned in the Pentateuch . But it was by Divine inspiration that Moses knew to distinguish between truth and error , between fiction and reality . The events recorded in the Pentateuch are to demonstrate and to keep constantly before our eyes the fact that there is a higher Power that ordains the fate of men and nations according to their deeds . Everything is described in a simple and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of Moses , the great prophet speaks of himself everywhere in the third person , except in the Book of Deuteronomy , in which he records his addresses to the people in the last year of his life . The last few verses , which describe the death of Moses , the mourning of the Israelites for the death of their teacher , and his exaltation above all other prophets , have been added to the Torah by Joshua the son of Nun , the leader of the Israelites after the death of Moses . Thus , from that day until the present the Torah , in its integrity , has been in the hands of the children of Israel . It was guarded as the most valuable national treasure , and although there have been not a few generations which were corrupt and idolatrous , Israel has never been entirely bereaved of pious and faithful worshippers of the true God ; and when in one generation or period the study and practice of the Torah were neglected , they were resumed with greater vigour and zeal in the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Torah is God 's Revelation to Moses . This article guarantees the validity of the Law as actually known and practised at present . Jewish orthodoxy has therefore always staunchly upheld the theory of verbal inspiration in its extremist form ? at least so far as the Pentateuch is concerned . " Higher Criticism " of the Pentateuch is flatly rejected and is considered a major heresy . The underlying assumption is that the whole fabric of traditional Judaism would crumble if its foundation , the notion of divine legislation to Moses , were to be exchanged for modernist ideas about historical growth and the composite nature of sacred texts . As a matter of fact Liberal and Reform Judaism once welcomed Biblical criticism for precisely that reason . They found in criticism a welcome ally in their struggle to get rid of the Law and to substitute for it a purely ethical ( and so-called " prophetic " ) Judaism . Conservative Judaism , as distinct from Orthodoxy and Liberalism , is concerned at present with adapting itself to the climate of Biblical Scholarship and with re-defining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. , in a way that would conserve their significance and validity . ' Of all the principles of faith none presents so many difficulties to the modern Jew as the eighth . Fundamentalism and the doc-  | trine of verbal inspiration have been very widely discredited . It is impossible for most Jews properly acquainted with the facts to accept Maimonides ' eighth principle in the form given to it by the great mediaeval thinker . At the same time , Judaism as a religion surely does depend on belief in Torah Min Ha-Shamayim ' , the Torah is from Heaven ' , which is only another way of saying that in Judaism , at least , there can be no religion without revelation . There is , of course , no a priori reason why God could not have revealed Himself to man and the modern believer will refuse to challenge the belief that He did so . The problem becomes acute only when the question of the content of revelation is considered . As we shall see , Maimonides is true to his Rabbinic sources in stating his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern period , it was held that the whole of the Pentateuch was dictated word by word and letter by letter by God to Moses . Moreover it was believed that the statements contained in the Pentateuch , being the word of God , were infallible . It is hardly necessary to point out that the challenges to the doctrine of Pentateuchal infallibility are now numerous . The question of the new account of the age of the earth which does not tally with Genesis ; the ancient civilisations which reach back far beyond the six thousand years of human history as recorded in the Pentateuch ; the fossil remains and the evidence for the existence of prehistoric man ; the archaeological evidence which has produced incontrovertible proof that both Pentateuchal narrative and law have to be understood against their oriental background ; the history of textual and higher criticism ; all of these unite to produce a convincing picture of the Pentateuch as a work with a human history and coloured by human ideas , including human errors . For all that , the Pentateuch is a unique record of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . It is widely recognised today that there is a divine as well as a human element in the Pentateuch . To understand the problem and the way to its solution it is necessary to study the history of Pentateuchal interpretation . This is the task upon which we now embark . In tractate Baba Bathra ( 14b ) , the Talmud quotes a Baraitha , dated not later than the end of the second century C.E. , in which it is said that Moses wrote his book , and the portion of Balaam ,  | and Job ; Joshua wrote his book and the last eight verses of the Torah ' ( i.e. the final Pentateuchal verses dealing with the death of Moses ) . The rather strange reference to the portion of Balaam has long puzzled the commentators . The probable meaning is that since Balaam was a prophet it might have been held that the whole portion of the book of Numbers in which his prophecies are found , was written by him . Hence the Baraitha states that Moses himself wrote this portion together with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage in the Jerusalem Talmud ( Sot . V. 6 ) it is said that Moses wrote the five books of the Torah and then he wrote the portion of Balak and Balaam and he wrote the book of Job ' ! In the comment of the Gemara ( B. B. 15a , the passage can only be dated approximately but it is certainly not earlier than the beginning of the third century and not later than the end of the fifth ) it is stated that the Baraitha follows the Tannaitic opinion which holds that Moses did not write the account of his own death . But another Baraitha is quoted in which this matter is disputed . The second Baraitha reads : ' " So Moses the servant of the Lord died there " ( Deut. xxxiv. 5 . ) . Is it possible that Moses , being dead , could have written " Moses died there " ? But up to this point Moses wrote , from this point Joshua wrote . This is the view of R. Judah , or , according to others , of R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him : Can a Scroll of the Torah be valid if even one letter is missing and yet it is written : " Take this book of the Torah " ( Deut. xxxi. 26 ) ? We must rather say that up to this point the Holy One , blessed be He , dictated and Moses wrote it down , and from this point the Holy One , blessed be He , dictated and Moses wrote it down with tears in his eyes , as it is said elsewhere : " Then Baruch answered them , He pronounced all these words to me with his mouth , and I wrote them with ink in the book " ( Jer. xxxvi. 18 ) ' . The quotation from Jeremiah is evidently intended to convey the thought that just as Baruch served as Jeremiah 's amanuensis Moses acted in the same fashion at God 's dictation . In the parallel passage in tractate Menahotli ( 30a ) R. Simeon 's remarks are more clearly stated : Up to this point the Holy One , blessed be He , dictated and Moses repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Holy One , blessed be He , dictated it and Moses wrote it down ( i.e. Moses repeated verbally all the  | rest of the Torah but he did not do so with regard to the account of his death but simply wrote it down without repeating it ) . Another Baraitha , quoted in tractate Sanhedrin ( 99a ) is even more emphatic that the belief in Torah from Heaven ' means that the whole Pentateuch was dictated by God to Moses : Because he hath despised the word of the Lord ' ( Num. xv . 31 ) . This verse refers to one who maintains that the Torah is not from heaven . And even if he maintains that the whole Torah is from heaven but that a certain verse was not dictated by the Holy One , blessed be He , but is from Moses himself , he is included under Because he hath despised the word of the Lord ' . And even if he admits that the whole Torah is from heaven with the exception of a single point , a particular argument from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain analogy ( gezcrah shawah ) , he is still included in Because he hath despised the word of the Lord ' . It should also be noted that in numerous passages in the Talmud a Pentateuchal verse is introduced with the formula The Compassionate says ' ( rahamana ' amar ) , implying that the words are God 's and not Moses ' own . It can not be too strongly stressed that in Rabbinic times , with the exception of the problem of the last eight verses , the question of the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch was not raised by anyone . Even the heretic , against whom the above passage is directed , did not think of denying that Moses wrote the Pentateuch . It would be false to the historical facts , therefore , to maintain that the Rabbis were concerned with establishing the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch . Rather they were concerned to emphasize that Moses wrote the Pentateuch at divine dictation , that he did not invent it himself . Two early third century Palestinian teachers debate whether the whole Torah was given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the Israelites ' stay in the wilderness ( Gitt. 60a ) . R. Johanan said in the name of R. Bara'ah : the Torah was transmitted in separate scrolls ( i.e. each portion was dictated to Moses at the time of the events it records ) , as it says : " Then said I , Lo I am come , in the roll of the book it is written of me " ( Ps. xl . 8 ) ; i.e. the Torah is composed of different rolls , of various documents written at diverse times . R. Simeon b . Laqish said : The Torah was transmitted entire ( hathumah = " sealed " ) as it says : " Take this book of the law "  | ( Deut. xxxi. 26 ) i.e. the whole Torah was transmitted as one book ' . Another Baraitha of relevance to the Rabbinic attitude is the following ( Makk 1 la ) : " And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the Law of God " ( Josh. xxiv. 26 ) . R. Judah and R. Nehemiah are divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the final eight verses of the Pentateuch , while the other takes them to be the section on the cities of refuge ( Josh. xx . 1-9 ) ' . Although the Gemara ( ibid. 11 a ) takes this latter idea to mean that Joshua wrote in his own book the words which are already found in the book of the Law of God ( = the Pentateuch ) it is fairly obvious that this is not the plain meaning of the Baraitha but an Amoraic interpretation dating from a period when it had become axiomatic that no Jewish teacher could hold that any part of the Pentateuch ( with the possible exception of the last eight verses ) was written by anyone but Moses . The plain meaning is , however , that according to either R. Judah or R. Nehemiah the whole section dealing with the laws of the refuge cities in the Pentateuch ( Num. xxxv. 9 ? 43 , Deut. xix. 1 ? 13 ) is a later addition made by Joshua . This explains the reference in the earlier Baraitha to either R. Judah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added by Joshua , i.e. since one of them holds that the addition by Joshua was that of the portion dealing with the cities of refuge ! We thus have three second century opinions , if we take the two Baraithoth together . ( 1 ) R. Simeon : The whole Pentateuch was written by Moses . ( 2 ) R. Judah or R. Nehemiah : The exception is the last portion dealing with Moses ' death . ( 3 ) R. Judah or R. Nehemiah : The exception is the portion dealing with the refuge cities . The view that Moses wrote the whole of the Pentateuch at divine dictation was the view of both Judaism and Christianity for a very long time , with hardly a dissenting voice . The references to the Law of Moses ' in the late book of Chronicles ( II Chron. xxiii. 18 ; II Chron. xxx . 16 ; c f . II Chron. xxxiii. 8 ) are almost certainly to the whole of the Pentateuch , as are the references in the book of Daniel ( ix . 11 and 13 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Law which Moses commanded for an heritage unto the congregations of Jacob ' ( Ecclesiasticus xxiv. 28 ) . Philo generally speaks less  | of divine dictation than of Moses ' utterances but it is clear that both Philo and Josephus share the universally held view of their day that the whole of the Pentateuch is of Mosaic authorship under divine inspiration ( v. Philo : Life of Moses ' II . 51 , Loeb Classical Series p. 595 ; Josephus : Antiquities ' IV 48 , Loeb Classical Series , p. 633 ) . In the gospels the same view is accepted ( v. Matt. xix. 8 ; Mark xii . 26 ; Luke xxiv. 27 and 44 ; cf. Acts xiii . 39 ; xv . 5 ; xxviii. 23 ) . It is no part of this work to consider in detail the views of Christian thinkers on the problem we are discussing , but it might be mentioned in passing that , in some respects , the readjustment required in a critical appraisal of the Pentateuch is more severe for Christians than for Jews , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pentateuch . On the whole modernists in the Church either adopt the position that it was no part of Jesus ' message to teach criticism to the Jews or they maintain that Jesus was liable to error so far as his human nature was concerned . If devout Christians are prepared to undertake such radical re-interpretations of their traditional faith for the sake of intellectual integrity devout Jews should not remain religious ostriches . In the Middle Ages , the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch was continually upheld ; the few dissidents we shall presently consider . We have already seen how emphatic Maimonides is on this question . Nahmanides in the Introduction to his renowned Commentary to the Pentateuch is similarly uncompromising . There ( v. ed . C. B. Chavel , Vol . I , Genesis , Exodus , ' Mosad Ha-Rav Kook , Jerusalem , 1959 , 1 ? 7 ) . Nahmanides observes that Moses wrote this book ( i.e. Genesis ) together with the rest of the Pentateuch at God 's dictation . It is probable , remarks Nahmanides , that Moses wrote the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mount Sinai . The rest of the Pentateuch Moses completed at the end of the forty years in the wilderness . This opinion , observes Nahmanides , follows the Rabbinic view ( mentioned above ) that the Torah was given scroll by scroll . In the other view that the Torah was given in its entirety , Moses wrote down the whole of the Pentateuch at the end of the forty years ' stay in the wilderness . We might have expected the Pentateuch to have begun , says Nahmanides , with some such introductory passage as : And God spoke unto  | loses all these words saying ' . But Moses wrote the Pentateuch , eluding the narrative portions dealing with his own life , in Ie third person , unlike the prophets who use the first person id who consequently preface their remarks with an intronctory phrase stating that the word of the Lord had come to tem . Thus Moses does not write And the word of the Lord tme to me ' but And the Lord spoke unto Moses ' . For the tme reason there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his birth in the book of Exodus . Even the Dok of Deuteronomy is no exception , for although here Moses ses the first person , in fact the book begins in the third person nd uses the first person passages in the form of reported speech . it be asked why Moses should have written the Pentateuch t the third person , Nahmanides ( relying on Talmudic and lidrashic passages which owe much to the Philonic idea of the , ogos ) replies that the Torah preceded the creation of the rorld , to say nothing of the birth of Moses ( v. Zeb. 116a , Hag. 3b . Gen. R. 8. 2 ) . Hence Moses is to be compared to a scribe who simply copies older work . Here we have the mystical view of the Torah , Tidely held in the Middle Ages , that over and above the his ) rical events narrated in the Pentateuch there is the primordial ' orah which contained the words describing these events long efore they happened . The whole record was there ' in heaven , e to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the iird person since before the creation of the world Moses nd the other heroes of the Pentateuch were yet unborn . Moses id no more than copy down the words of the primordial ' orah . It is true , beyond doubt , concludes Nahmanides , that 1e whole of the Pentateuch , from the beginning of Genesis the final words of Deuteronomy , reached the ear of Moses om the mouth of the Holy One , blessed be He ' . ( This appears mean that although the primordial Torah was in existence /loses could not read it and hence God 's dictation to him was ecessary ) . The secrets of the Torah , says Nahmanides , were evealed to Moses who either recorded them in the Torah xplicitly or hinted at them in the Torah . The nature of the ints by means of which these profound mysteries are referred in the Torah consists of such things as the use of special titters , larger or smaller than others , in the numerical value  | of words and letters by a kind of divine code , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have a true tradition that , in reality , the whole of the Torah is composed of letters which combine to form various divine names . It is for this reason that every single letter of the Torah has its own significance and a Scroll of the Torah is invalid if even one letter is missing . Even though the plain meaning may be unaffected the requisite number of letters is required to make up the total of the divine names . There can be little doubt that this mystical view of the Torah , which goes far beyond Maimonides ' formulation of the eighth principle , had much influence in maintaining the traditional conception . It effectively prevented any attempt to regard the Pentateuch like any other book , at least on its human side . For how can one compare the divine names of God to a work of human composition ? To this day there are to be found devout Jews who remain unmoved by such matters as contradictions both in the different parts of the Pentateuch and by the findings of modern science in their belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone ( though , of course , these events will not be denied ) but a divine text of the profoundest meaning , containing sublime mysteries beyond all human ken . In a well-known passage in the Zohar ( III . 152a ) this view is put forward in these words : Said R. Simeon : " Alas for the man who regards the Torah as a book of mere tales and everyday matters ! If that were so , we , even we could compose a torah dealing with everyday affairs , and of even greater excellence . Nay , even the princes of the world possess books of greater worth which we could use as a model for composing some such torah . The Torah , however , contains in all its words supernal truths and sublime mysteries . . . Thus had the Torah not clothed herself in garments of this world the world could not endure it . The stories of the Torah are thus only her outer garments , and whoever looks upon that garment as being the Torah itself , woe to that man ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world " . David thus said : " Open thou mine eyes , that I may behold wondrous things out of thy Law " ( Ps. cxix. 18 ) , to wit , the things that are beneath the garment . Observe this . The garments worn by a man are the most visible part of him , and senseless people looking at the man do not seem to see  | more in him than the garments . But in truth the pride of the garments is the body of the man , and the pride of the body is the soul . Similarly , the Torah has a body made up of the precepts of the Torah , called guphe Torah ( bodies , main principles of the Torah ) , and that body is enveloped in garments made up of worldly narrations . The senseless people see only the garment , the mere narrations ; those who are somewhat wiser penetrate as far as the body . But the really wise , the servants of the most high King , those who stood on Mount Sinai , penetrate right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , namely , to the real Torah " ' . EXCURSUS On the Torah as a collection of divine names v. Zohar II . 87a . Of relevance to Rabbinic views on the Pentateuchal revelation is the dispute between R. Akiba and R. Ishmael : whether only the general principles of the laws were given on Sinai , with the details given later in the Tent of Meeting , or whether the details , too , were given at Sinai ( Hag. 6a ) . On the whole subject v. Chapter II in George Foot Moore 's Judaism ' , Vol . I , Harvard University Press , 1958 , pp. 235 if . Moore rightly says that it was an uncontested axiom with the Rabbinical schools that every syllable of Scripture has the verity and authenticity of the word of God . The contents of the sacred books were held to be throughout consentaneous and homogeneous . There were no contradictions in them and no real differences . The revelation to Moses was thought of as complete and final and the notion of progressive revelation was impossible . No prophet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Meg. 2b . Moore concludes ( p. 25 ) : In fact the application of modern historical and critical methods to the Scriptures , and above all the introduction of the idea of development , involves , consciously or unconsciously , a complete change in the idea of revelation , a change which Orthodoxy , whether Jewish or Christian , has resisted with the instinct of self-preservation ' . The statement in Meg. alb that Moses uttered the curses in Deuteronomy himself ( unlike those in Leviticus which were from the mouth of the Almighty ' ) is , of course , no contradiction to the general Rabbinic view , for the meaning is that Moses uttered them himself after having been told them by God , v. note of Jacob Emden in the Vilna ed. of Sanh. 99a , who remarks that the Shekhinah spoke out of the throat of Moses ' . In fact Emden has been anticipated by the Tos. to Meg. 31b , s.v.  | Mosh me'atzmo . The Tos. observe that Moses said them by the aid of the Holy Spirit ' . The expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but is frequently used by later Jewish , as well as Muslim , authorities , v. Ginzberg 's ' Legends ' , Vol . VI , p. 36 note 201 . A good example of how the mediaeval mystical view of the Torah persists even in non-mystical circles is the statement of the highly revered Haphetz Hayyim ( d. 1933 ) that the Torah is to be compared to the architect 's plans ( ' God looked into the Torah and created the world ' ) . Hence , a Scroll of the Torah from which even one letter is missing is invalid since a single letter represents a portion of the universe , much as a stroke or line in the architect 's plans represents a whole wall in the completed building , v. ' Sepher Haphetz Hayyim ' Al Ha-Torah ' , ed . S. Greiniman , 2nd. ed. , Bene Berak , 19.54 , pp. 25-26 , cf. p. 24 . A formidable ' either/or ' on the question of the Mosaic authorship and divine character of the whole of the Pentateuch was launched by the great German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( v. ' Judaism Eternal , Selected Essays from the Writings of Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch ' , trans. by Dayan Dr. I. Grunfeld , Vol . II , Soncino Press , London , 1956 , pp. 213 ff ) . ' Let us not deceive ourselves . The whole question is simply this . Is the statement " And God spoke to Moses saying " , with which all the laws of the Jewish Bible commence , true or not true ? Do we really and truly believe that God , the Omnipotent and Holy , spoke thus to Moses ? Do we speak the truth when in front of our brethren we lay our hand on the scroll containing these words and say that God has given us this Torah , that His Torah , the Torah of truth and with it of eternal life , is planted in our midst ? If this is to be no mere lip-service , no mere rhetorical flourish , then we must keep and carry out this Torah without omission and without carping , in all circumstances and at all times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all human judgment , the rule to which all our actions must at all times conform ; and instead of complaining that it is no longer suitable to the times , our only complaint must be that the times are no longer suitable to it ' . In England , the late Chief Rabbi Dr. Hertz was a doughty upholder of the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch . V. in particular his frequent observations in his Commentary to the Pentateuch , Soncino Press , London , 1937 and subsequently , and his sermon preached on May 22nd , 1926 , at the Dalston Synagogue , London ( printed in Hertz 's ' Affirmations of Judaism ' , Oxford University Press , London , 1927 , pp. 39-54 ) . Among Hertz 's remarks in this sermon are the following : ' Wellhausen and his followers thus tear the Torah to tatters and reduce its contents to legend and fiction ' . ' Every attack on the Torah is at the same time an assault against Israel , as well as  | a revolt against the Spiritual and the Divine in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pagan forces of our age had assembled together , and in their heathen rage resolved to break the bonds of the Hebrew heritage to humanity , and cast away the moral restraints which Israel first taught mankind ' . Hertz concludes : And we , the descendants of those who stood at the foot of Sinai , will continue to bless Him who is the God of truth , whose Law is a Law of truth , whose prophets are prophets of truth , and who aboundeth in deeds of goodness and truth . We will continue to lift the Sepher Torah on high and exclaim : " This is the Law which Moses set before the children of Israel at the command of the Lord " . We will continue to sing ? and teach our children to sing ? " A true Torah God gave unto His people , By the hand of Moses , his faithful prophet " ' . One can compare this with Dean Burgon 's sermon preached in Oxford in 1861 : The Bible is none other than the voice of Him that sitteth upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , every verse of it , every syllable of it ( where are we to stop ? ) , every letter of it , is the direct utterance of the Most High . The Bible is none other than the Word of God , ? not some part of it more , some part of it less , but all alike the utterance of Him who sitteth upon the throne , faultless , unerring , supreme ' . In the last century many Christians recognised the strength of the critical position and were prepared to accept it but were held back owing to their belief that it challenged the authority of Jesus . He had referred to Moses , to David and to Daniel ( Mark xiii . 14 ) and therefore considered these to be the authors of the Pentateuch , the Psalms and the book of Daniel respectively , v. L. E. Elliot-Binns : English Thought 1860 ? 1900 : The Theological Aspect ' , Longmans , Green , London , 1956 , p. 146 . It is one of the oddities of Jewish apologetics that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2nd. ed. , Vallentine , London , pp. 205 if . feels compelled to defend specifically the traditional authorship of the book of Daniel , which indeed presents a problem for Christians , for the reason stated , but which presents hardly any problem at all to Jews . W. Robertson Smith ( 1846 ? 94 ) was charged with heresy because of his article Bible ' in the Encyclopedia Britannica ( 1875 ) in which he accepted the Higher Criticism . He was finally removed from his professorial chair , in the free Church College at Aberdeen . For the whole fascinating story v. The Life of William Robertson Smith ' , by J. S. Black and G. Chrystal , Adam and Charles Black , London , 1912 , and Lectures ' ill and Essays of William Robertson Smith ' , same authors and pub-  | ushers , 1912 . It should finally be noted that Muslim theologians , in the Middle Ages , were wont to claim that the Rabbis had falsified the Torah . It is almost certain that Maimonides ' emphasis in the eighth article on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least , against this view , v. H. Hirschfeld : ' Mohammedan Criticism of the Bible ' in JQR ( Old Series ) , Vol . XIII , 1901 , pp. 222-240 . Cf. M. Soloweitchick and Z. Rubashov : Toledoth Biggoreth Ha-Migra , Berlin , 1928 . On Rabbinic views Abraham J. Heschel : Torah Min Ha-Shamayim ' , Soncino Press , London , 1962 , should be consulted . It is obvious that the main challenge to the traditional view of the Pentateuch as an infallible book dictated by God to Moses has only come to the fore in modern times . The sciences of geology , zoology and biology , the new astronomy , the profounder sense of history , the anthropological and archaeological evidence , the emergence of Biblical criticism , all of which demand a revision of the traditional picture , are all comparatively recent developments . It is more than a little naive to ask why God did not choose to reveal this knowledge to earlier generations . If the question is put the only possible answer is that He did not choose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have revealed all truth about all things at once is a demand for the total abolition of human history . Consequently , we can hardly expect the ancients to have had the reasons we have for re-examining and re-interpreting the doctrine of Torah from Heaven ' . It is the recognition of this which renders so fatuous the retort to the modernist sometimes advanced by the traditionalist : Are you better than Maimonides ? ' or Are you better informed about the nature of the Torah than the Rabbis ? ' For it is not at all a question of what Maimonides or the Rabbis said but of what they would have said were they alive today . It should further be noted that the aim of a true Biblical criticism is not to sit in judgment on the Bible ( as the rather unfortunate term Higher Criticism ' might imply and as some of its practitioners might at times have believed ) but to discover what the Bible , including the Pentateuch , has to tell us about its own composition . Bible criticism seeks the answer to the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they addressed in the first instance ? What was their original  | meaning ? It is in the light of these observations that we proceed to examine the history of the challenge to the traditional view as recorded in Maimonides ' eighth article of the faith . It must first be noted that , with the exception of the very late books of Chronicles and Daniel mentioned earlier , there is no claim anywhere in the Hebrew Bible that Moses wrote the whole of the Pentateuch . From this point of view modern criticism , while untraditional so far as the teaching of the past two thousand years is concerned , is really an attempt to rediscover the original Biblical tradition . ( It hardly needs to be said that the recognition of this truth has no relevance to the question we shall be discussing later of the significance of Jewish observance as practised during the past two thousand years . This has acquired a validity of its own ) . Furthermore , although , as we have seen , the virtually unanimous opinion in Rabbinic times and in the Middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ echoes of other views , and even , on occasion , a challenge to the traditional view , even in the Middle Ages . In the Apocryphal second book of Esdras a strange story is told of how Ezra was ordered by God to rewrite the Law of God which had been burned ( v. II Esdras , xiv ) . In the Rabbinical literature , too , there is a reference to the Torah being forgotten and then restored by Ezra ( Sukk. 20a ) and there is a saying to the effect that if the Torah had not been given through Moses it would have been given through Ezra ( Sanh. 21b ) . It would be going far beyond the evidence to suggest that in these passages we have anything like an anticipation of modern critical views which see the hand of Ezra and his associates in the Pentateuch as we have it , but it is interesting to note that in early times there was a widespread recognition of the importance of Ezra and his time in the history of Judaism and that Ezra 's work was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the first Jew to challenge the traditional view openly was Hiwi Al-Balkhi , who was born in Balkh in Persia in the ninth century . Hiwi offered two hundred objections to the doctrine of the divine origin of the Bible . This work has been lost but is known to us from quotations from it and refutations of its arguments in the works of mediaeval authors . The great Saadiah Gaon composed a special work in refutation of Hiwi 's views . The objections of Hiwi known to  | us are of an extremely rationalistic character , such as his explanation of the parting of the Red Sea as due to the ebb and flood tide and the shine on Moses 's face as due to the dryness of his skin through prolonged fasting . Hiwi also noted contradictions between different parts of Scripture . It is very probable that Hiwi was influenced by rationalistic anti-Jewish literature popular in his day . In Jewish circles Hiwi was regarded as a heretic and was often referred to , by a pun on his name , as the dog ' , Al-Kalbi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . VI , pp. 429 ? 430 and the literature cited there ) . In the Cairo Geniza there was found a collection of Bible difficulties by an ancient critic of a similar frame of mind to that of Hiwi . Solomon Schechter published this material under the title : Geniza Specimens ? The Oldest Collection of Bible Difficulties , by a Jew ' ( J. Q. R. , Old Series , Vol . XIII , 1901 , pp. 345 ? 374 ) . The document presents a puzzle as to its author . Schechter does not accept a Karaite authorship since it is not the Rabbinical tradition which is attacked but the Scriptures themselves . The tone of the polemic is very sceptical and aggressive with a marked anti-Scriptural bias . Among the difficulties recorded by this unknown author ( whom Schechter suggests belongs to the school of Hiwi Al-Balkhi ) are the following : ( 1 ) The arrangement of the forbidden marriages is different in Lev . xx and Lev . xviii , while in Deut. xxvii only four of the forbidden degrees are mentioned . ( 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not slaughtered in the proper manner and yet the ravens fed Elijah with meat ( I Kings xvii. 6 , cf. Hull . 5a ) . ( 3 ) The Day of Atonement and the Day of Sounding the Horn , though mentioned in the list of festivals in Leviticus and Numbers ( Lev . xxiii. 23 ? 32 ; Num. xxix. 1 ? 11 ) , are not mentioned in the list of festivals in Deuteronomy ( Deut. xvi ) . ( 4 ) There are moral difficulties in Scripture such as the pestilence which resulted from David numbering the people ( II Sam . xxiv. 1 , 13 and 14 ) . For all his criticism , the author does not appear to reject Scripture entirely . Schechter ironically remarks that the author 's position vis-a-vis the Bible would resemble very much the one  | held in modern times by many a Broad Churchman who has long ago accepted Wellhausen and Stade as the infallible authorities on the interpretation of the History of Israel , but would continue out of mere force of habit , or out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Word of God " , the " Holy Writ " , the " Divine Revelation of the Bible " ' . ( It need hardly be said that Schechter 's interpretation of their position would have been repudiated by many a Broad Churchman of his day . And this is of more than passing interest since our problem , as theirs , is to safeguard the idea of the Bible as the Word of God ' ? Torah Min Ha-Shamayim ' ? without surrendering to fundamentalism . Schechter had many helpful things to say but he was not always at his best when riding his hobby horse of the Higher Anti-Semitism ' , as he dubbed the Higher Criticism ' ) . Hiwi Al-Balkhi and Schechter 's unknown author had little influence in the traditional Jewish camp . In any event the tone they adopted was anti-Scriptural . Far otherwise is it with regard to one of the greatest Jews of the Middle Ages , Abraham Ibn Ezra ( 1088 ? 1167 ) , justly hailed by many as the real father of Bible Criticism . Although there were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facts are that his famous Commentary is printed in the better editions of the Hebrew Bible and he is accepted today as a foremost orthodox ' exponent of Judaism . Ibn Ezra 's comments are cryptic in the extreme and his more orthodox commentators have sought to explain his views in more conservative fashion , but there can be little doubt that beneath all his veiled language , Ibn Ezra gives expression to the idea , remarkably bold for its day , that there are post-Mosaic additions in the Pentateuch . It is true that in his Commentary to Gen. xxxvi. 31 Ibn Ezra attacks a certain Isaac ( of Toledo ? 982 ? 1057 ) for suggesting that the whole passage concerning the kings of Edom dates from the reign of Jehoshaphat ; yet , for all that , Ibn Ezra himself does accept a later date than the time of Moses for some passages in the Pentateuch . We shall see presently the attempt of Joseph Bonfils to solve the contradiction between Ibn Ezra 's own opinions and his fierce attack on Isaac . In his Commentary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Deut. i. 1 : These are the words which Moses spoke  | unto all Israel beyond the Jordan ' . In Moses ' day the Israelites had not yet entered the Promised Land and the term beyond the Jordan ' would not have been used for the side of the Jordan on which they were encamped . In an admittedly cryptic and difficult passage , Ibn Ezra remarks : If you know the secret of the twelve , and of " And Moses wrote " , and of " And the Canaanite was then in the land " , and of " In the mount where the Lord is seen " , and of " Behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron " , you will discover the truth ' . Spinoza , who , as we shall see , was anticipated by the fourteenth century scholar , Joseph Bonfils , gives this , surely correct , explanation of Ibn Ezra 's riddle . The secret of the twelve ' refers to the last twelve verses of the Pentateuch which deal with the death of Moses and which could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words And Moses wrote ' ( Ex. xxiv. 4 ; Num. xxxiii. 2 ; Deut. xxxi. 9 ) presuppose another author . And the Canaanite was then in the land ' ( Gen. xii . 6 ) is hard to explain if this verse were written by Moses because in his day the Canaanites were still in the land . In the mount where the Lord is seen ' ( Gen. xxii. 14 ) is understood as referring to the Temple which , of course , did not exist in Moses ' day . Behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron ' ( Deut. iii . 11 ) speaks of the bedstead of Og , king of Bashan , who was slain by Moses towards the end of the latter 's life , while the words seem to imply that the bedstead was pointed out as a landmark , or as an exhibit in the equivalent of the local museum , many years after Og had been slain . In his comment to Gen. xii . 6 And the Canaanite was then in the land ' , Ibn Ezra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Canaan had just seized the land from another ( i.e. and the meaning is , therefore , And the Canaanite was just then in the land ' ) . If this is not satisfying , he goes on to say , there is a secret here and the wise will be silent ! But apart from these passages , Ibn Ezra to Num. xxi. 1 ( ' And the Canaanite , the king of Arad , who dwelt in the South , heard that Israel came by way of Atharim. ' ) remarks that many say this portion was written by Joshua and their proof is the king of Arad , one ' ( Josh. xii . 14 ) , i.e. it is stated in the book of Joshua that it was Joshua , not Moses , who killed the king of Arad . Going beyond the above-mentioned Tannaitic view that only the last eight verses of the Pentateuch were written by Joshua ,  | Ibn Ezra in his comments to Deut. xxxiv. 1 argues that Joshua wrote the whole of the last chapter of the Pentateuch , since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascent to the mount on which he was to die and once he had ascended the mount he could not have written anything for posterity . ( Since there are twelve verses in the last chapter there can hardly be any doubt that this is the secret of the twelve ' ) . Joshua , continues Ibn Ezra , wrote this portion after the manner of a prophet ' i.e. Joshua wrote as a prophet under divine inspiration . Finally , there is Ibn Ezra 's comment to Deut. xxxiv. 6 : And he was buried in the valley in the land of Moab over against Bethpeor ; and no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day ' . This , says Ibn Ezra , must have been written by Joshua , probably towards the end of his life , so that sufficient time would have elapsed since the death of Moses to refer to it , as is implied by the use of unto this day ' , as an event in the distant past . In spite of attempts by Dr. Friedlander and others to explain these passages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention is as we have explained it . It is certainly significant that the fourteenth century teacher , Joseph Bonfils , to whom we have referred , interprets Ibn Ezra in this way . Joseph Bonfils , otherwise known as Joseph ben Eliezer HaSephardi , wrote his Commentary to Ibn Ezra , entitled Tzophnath Paneah ' , at the request of David ben Joshua , Rabbi of Damascus , who was , incidentally , a great-grandson of Maimonides ( The Tzophnath Paneah ' was edited by D.

Ibn Ezra 's comment on And the Canaanite was then in the land ' is taken by Bonfils ( Vol . I , pp. 92 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prophet who lived after Moses . Since we are obliged to believe in the words of tradition and in the words of prophecy ' , elaborates Bonfils , what difference can there be if Moses wrote it or another prophet , since the words of every prophet are true and divinely inspired ? ' But Bonfils goes on to ask , what of the prohibition of adding to the Torah ( Deut.  | xiii . I ) ? His reply is that the prohibition refers only to an addition of new precepts , not found in the Torah , not to an expansion of the narrative portions . Similarly , the Baraitha in tractate Sanhedrin , which treats the person who denies the Mosaic authorship of even one letter of the Pentateuch as a heretic , refers only to the words and letters of the precepts , not of the narrative portions of the Pentateuch . In support of this novel view , Bonfils quotes the Baraitha in Maklc. 1l a , in which Tannaitic teachers do not hesitate to ascribe either the last eight verses of the Pentateuch or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As for Ibn Ezra 's dark reference to a secret ' and the need for the wise ' to be silent ' , Bonfils comments : This secret should not be made known to ordinary people in order that they be not led to treat the Torah offhandedly , since one who is not wise can not distinguish between verses containing precepts and those of a purely narrative character . Furthermore , secrecy is necessary because if the nations get to hear of it they will taunt us that our Torah was once true but we have changed it . ( We have seen that Muslim theologians frequently levelled the charge against the Jews that they had falsified the Torah ) . Consequently , Ibn Ezra says " And the wise will be silent " for the sage understands how harmless all this really is and it is only the fools who make it a matter of guilt ' . Ibn Ezra 's comment on Gen. xxii. 14 , the reference to the mount of the Lord , is simply to refer the reader to his comment to the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole question . Bonfils ( Vol . I , p. 112 ) states : According to this , the verse was not written by Moses but the later prophets wrote it ' . By the later prophets are meant prophets other than Joshua who lived at a time when the Temple stood . Elaborating on Ibn Ezra 's comments to the beginning of Deuteronomy , Bonfils ( Vol . II , pp. 65 ? 66 ) explains : The author 's meaning is that if you understand the secret of these verses to be that they were not written by Moses you will understand that the five verses from the beginning of Deuteronomy to " The Lord our God spoke unto us " were not written by Moses but by one of the later prophets . The verse " The Lord our God " , with which the subject matter really begins , follows on the verse " These are the commandments and the ordinances "  | ( Num. xxxvi. 13 ) , the end of the book of " And the Lord spoke " ( = Numbers ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasp the truth . As evidence of this it can be seen that all these five verses use the third person as if someone else is describing what happened . If you object that all the rest of the Torah is in the third person , you must surely see the difference . For here indications are given to identify the places in which these precepts were uttered , the indications being : " in the wilderness , in the Arabah " etc. and if Moses had written this no indications would have been necessary since all Israel were there and they knew the places . What reason can Moses have had , therefore , for giving them means of identifying places where they themselves had been and of which they knew ? It was this consideration which forced Ibn Ezra to explain the verses as he did ' . It is really beside the point whether Ibn Ezra really did have all this in mind . The important fact to recognise is that a Jewish teacher , as early as the fourteenth century , saw no objections to dissecting ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the internal evidence , that the first five verses of Deuteronomy were a later interpolation ! If this is so , observes Bonfils ( Vol . I , p. 149 ) , why does Ibn Ezra vent his spleen , in his Commentary to Gen. xxxvi , on Isaac , who suggests that the portion was written in the days of Jehoshaphat ? Why does Ibn Ezra in his wrath declare that Isaac 's book deserves to be burnt ? Bonfils claims that Ibn Ezra makes a distinction between the addition of explanatory glosses to Moses 's original words and the addition of a whole portion by later prophets . The latter would offend against the prohibition of adding to the Torah . While Bonfils is probably correct in attributing this distinction to Ibn Ezra , he himself is somewhat confused . As we have noted earlier , he quotes in support of his and Ibn Ezra 's views the Baraitha in Makkoth concerning the refuge cities . Here there is an addition of a whole portion , an addition which is moreover inconsistent with Bonfils ' further distinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unless we are to say Bonfils did not follow his ideas to their logical conclusion , we must suppose that Bonfils distinguishes between a completely new portion added to the Torah , or a completely new precept ,  | and the portion dealing with the refuge cities which is simply a record of the Mosaic law , written down in Joshua 's day but given by God to Moses . Before we take leave of Ibn Ezra it might be noticed in passing that this great exegete was gifted with critical powers far in excess of his non-critical age . Among other matters , he anticipated , in his Commentary to Isaiah , the opinion of modern scholars , who generally acknowledge their debt to him , that the second part of the book of Isaiah ( from Chapter xl ) was not written by the prophet Isaiah . Ibn Ezra 's comment in his Introduction to the book of Psalms ( v. Friedlander , op. cit. , p. 60 f. ) is also of interest . There he notes that he fails to see why the Commentators should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Psalms stating that they were written by David . There is no doubt among Jews that Moses wrote the book of Genesis , as our forefathers were taught by tradition , and yet it does not begin And the Lord spake unto Moses ' . Long before , then , the rise of modern Biblical criticism here were two Jewish Bible scholars , Ibn Ezra and Bonfils , who applied critical methods to questions of Biblical authorship . Modern criticism goes a good deal further than either of these two pioneers could have gone in their day . As it is they were in advance of their age by centuries . But basically the methods are the same . When the question of authorship is considered it is the task of the student to examine the available evidence and form his conclusions from it . It is facts such as these which make so hollow the battle-cry of Jewish fundamentalism that modern critics are governed by anti-Semitic considerations and by the need for demonstrating the superiority of the New Testament over the Old . One would be naive in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at work in the writings of non-Jewish Bible scholars . But this demands caution and discernment on the part of the Jewish scholar , not an outright rejection of the whole critical position or an attempt to prejudge the issue in the name of faith . It should be seen that many modern Bible scholars approached their task with a wholly admirable blending of objectivity and reverence for the Bible and that the pioneering work was done by Jewish scholars in the Middle Ages . It would be too  | much to claim Ibn Ezra and Bonfils for the ranks of objective scholarship . This was completely unknown in both Jewish and Christian circles until modern times . For all their independence and self-reliance , both Ibn Ezra and Bonfils are careful not to offend against tradition and they claim , indeed , that their views are supported by tradition . For all that , it is a source of pride for critically-minded Jews that two Jewish scholars entertained , for their day , highly unconventional views in obedience to the truth as they saw it . Serious Pentateuchal criticism really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scholars began to see that the problem was far too complicated to admit of the simple solution that certain anachronisms are to be explained as later glosses to Moses ' original work . In 1520 A. B. Carlstadt pointed out that both the style and the diction were the same in the Pentateuchal passage dealing with Moses ' death and in the preceding passages . The Catholic A. Masius in his Commentary to Joshua ( 1574 ) conjectured that the Pentateuch was compiled by Ezra from ancient documents . Among the anachronisms noted by Masius were the references to the city of Dan in Gen. xiv . 14 and Deut. xxxiv. 1 . But according to the book of Joshua ( xix. 47 ) the name of the city was Leshem until the children of Dan conquered it after Moses ' death . Thomas Hobbes in his Leviathan ' , published in 1651 , Chapter 32 , accepts the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch but not of the anachronisms , of which he lists Gen. xii . 6 ( And the Canaanite was then in the land ' ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Moses ' sepulchre unto this day . Hobbes also pointed to Num. xxi. 14 , in which a song is quoted by the author illustrating events which took place towards the end of Moses ' life . This does not make sense if Moses was the author of the passage in which the song is quoted . Baruch Spinoza in his Tractatus Theologico-politicus ' ( Hamburg , 1670 ) quotes Ibn Ezra 's brief comments in Chapter 8 and holds that Pentateuch is a composite work compiled in the days of Ezra . Spinoza noted that some of the Pentateuchal stories are repeated more than once with differences in the accounts . Richard Simon , a Catholic priest , published a work in 1678 in which he put forward the view that the Pentateuch was a compilation of a great number of documents of different dates . In Simon 's  | opinion the commandments of the Pentateuch were inspired by God but the narratives are purely human . Thus so far two ideas had been advanced , both contradicting the traditional view . The first of these consisted of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pentateuch to Moses , the second , a growing recognition that the Pentateuch was not a homogeneous but a composite work . It can not be too strongly stressed that the later Documentary Hypothesis was advanced as a solution to questions which had been raised long before the nineteenth century . Modifications of Wellhausen , and they are many , or even his complete overthrow , do not affect the existence of the problem , which is , if Moses did not write the Pentateuch and it is a composite work , who did write it and how were its parts put together ? A further matter of importance must be mentioned . Part of the aim of modern Bible scholarship is to see the Bible against its Oriental background . A pioneer in this field was John Spencer of Ely and Cambridge ( 1630 ? 1695 ) whose work The Laws of the Hebrews ' laid the foundations of Comparative Religion . In the Prolegomena to the work Spencer states his aim : To show that the laws and rites of the Jews were not instituted of God without reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of a determined opposition to idolatrous practices which it was the aim of Pentateuchal legislation to eradicate in the interests of a pure faith . Now John Spencer acknowledges his indebtedness to Maimonides , a major portion of whose Guide ' is devoted to this very theme . Spencer influenced in turn both W. Robertson Smith and James Frazer . It is thus no exaggeration to hail Maimonides as the pioneer in the field of Comparative Religion , as Ibn Ezra was the pioneer in the field of Biblical criticism . So much for the parrot-cry that present-day Jewish Bible critics are merely aping Christian scholars of dubious motives . In any event , the issue is one of truth and integrity . If the notion accept the truth from whichever source it comes ' is acceptable to Jews , and the saying is itself of Jewish origin and has often been held up as an ideal by Jewish teachers , then , painful though it may be to have to make the necessary adjustments , Jews concerned with the truth must be prepared to make them . Needless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question of loyalty to one 's faith  | or with the question of whether reason should reign supreme in matters of faith . The question of dating the Pentateuch and understanding how it came to be is a matter of fact , not of faith . That God is good , for example , is an affirmation of faith and the true believer will hold fast in this faith even in the face of suffering and evil . That God revealed Himself in the Torah is similarly a matter of faith and there can be no Judaism without revelation . But that God dictated the whole of the Pentateuch to Moses is a belief which has become increasingly difficult to maintain because it appears to be in flat contradiction to the facts , these facts consisting of a considerable body of internal evidence as well as the mass of external evidence provided by the physical sciences , by comparative religion , by historical studies and archaeology . To persist in the traditional belief in the teeth of this kind of evidence is just as much an abuse of faith as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is flat or no more than about six thousand years old because it says so in the Bible . When all is said and done the factual evidence is so convincing that it can be claimed that every serious scholar accepts it , that hardly any Jewish Bible scholar of note today entertains for one moment the fundamentalist position . Whether or not Jewish scholars are followers of Wellhausen is beside the point . Whatever the theory of the scholar concerning the composition of the Pentateuch , he has arrived at it by scientific , not dogmatic , grounds . The only alternative to a scientific approach in these matters ( which after all , only means an unprejudiced and unbiased examination of the facts , allowing these to speak for themselves ) is to believe that God dictated the Pentateuch to Moses in such a manner as to allow it to give the impression of being a post-Mosaic and composite work . It is true that on any conception of God His ways are mysterious and unfathomable but it is neither a general religious nor a Jewish view that He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , Vol . VI , p. 48 has called attention to an unknown mediaeval chronicler who held that Moses used written and oral sources for the compilation of the history prior to his time , Neubauer : Medieval Jewish Chronicles ' , I. 163 . It should be noted  | that the fact that the Commentary of Ibn Ezra was printed together with those of Rashi , Nahmanides etc. caused it to enjoy equal authority with them in spite of its unconventional views , v. Naphtali Ben-Menham 's list of Hasidic Rabbis who spoke of Ibn Ezra with great respect in ' Sepher Ha-Ba ' al Skein Tobh ' , ed . J. L. Maimon , Jer. 1960 , pp. 107 ? 111 . In addition to the anachronisms noted by Ibn Ezra and Bonfils the following have been noted by a succession of scholars . The mention of camels in the Patriarchal narratives is anachronistic since camels were not domesticated until much later . But Cyrus H. Gordon : Hebrew Origins in Biblical and Other Studies ' , ed . A. Altmann , Harvard Univ . Press , 1963 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no anachronism . The centralisation of worship as taught in Deuteronomy is unknown in prophetic times e.g. Elijah at Carmel , Amos does not protest against the very existence of Beth-El . The Day of Atonement appears to be unknown during the whole of the Monarchical period . Deut. ii . 12 is anachronistic for Moses ' day as is Deut. xxiii. 5 and the references to unto this day ' in Deut. iii . 9 ? 11 , 14 . Similarly , the reference to the days of old ' in Deut. xxxii. 7 and the reference to folly done in Israel in Gen. xxxiv. 7 . Further examples are : Gen. xxviii. 14 and elsewhere ( geographical terms which really mean seaward ' and towards the Negebh ' and are Palestinian terms ) ; Gen. xl . 15 ( ' the land of theHebrews ' ) ; Num. xxi. 27 f ; the references to the Philistines , Gen. xxi. 34 ; xxvi. 14 , 15 , 18 ; Ex. xiii . 17 , who did not inhabit the lands until later ; the references to Alnalek in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the use of the Persian word dath in Deut. xxxiii. 2 ( unless the text is at fault ) ; the terms in which Moses is spoken of in Ex. xi . 3 and Num. xii . 8 . The duplicates in the Pentateuch are very hard to account for on the view that it is homogeneous and the discrepancies are even more puzzling . Of duplicates the following have been noted : the two creation accounts in Gen. i. 1 ? ii . 4 with Gen. ii . 5 ? 25 ; Gen. xii . 10 ? 20 with Gen. x , Abraham and Sarah as his sister , cf. Gen. xxvi. 6 ? 14 ; the two Hagar Stories , Gen. xvi . 4 ? 14 with Gen. xxi. 8 ? 21 ; Beersheba and Bethel in Gen. xxi. 22 ? 34 ; xxvi. 26 ? 34 ; xxviii. 19 ; xxxv. 14 f ; the Joseph narrative ; the accounts of laughter ' in Gen. xvii. 17 ; xviii . 12 ; xxi. 6 ? 7 ; the call of Moses , Ex. iii with Ex. vi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's death in Num. xxxiii. 31 ? 39 with Deut. x. 6 ; the appointment of a king sanctioned in Deut. xvii. 16 ? 20 but opposed in I Sam . viii . 47 ; the sending of the spies in Num. xiii . 1 ? 3 at the command of God but not in Deut. i. 22 ? 23 ; Isaac must have spent eighty years on his death bed , v. Gen. xxv. 26 ; xxvi. 84 ; xxxv. 28 ; on sacrifices Deut. xii . 13 f ; contradicts Ex. xx . 24 ; Tabernacles is for 7 days in Deut. xvi .  | 15 but for 8 days in Lev . xxiii. 36 ; on the Levites v. Deut. xviii . 6 ? 8 ; Ex. xxviii. 1 f ; Num. iii . 5 ? 10 ; the divine name unknown before Moses . Ex. vi . 2 f but v. Gen. iv . 1 and 26 and Gen. xv . 7 ; the ' pillar ' forbidden in Ex. xxiii. 24 ; Ex. xxxiv. 13 and Deut. vii 5 but erected in Gen. xxxi. 45 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Josh. xxiv. 25-27 ; I Sam . vii . 12 ; l l Sam . xviii . 18 ; Hos. iii . 4 ; Sarah young in Gen. xii . 10 ? 20 and xx . 1 ? 8 but very old in Gen. xvii. 7 ; the two accounts of the Decalogue , Ex. xx . 1 ? 14 and Deut. v. 6 ? 18 . It is , of course , possible to account for each of these difficulties separately and fundamentalists generally try to do so but it runs counter to all scientific method to explain each detail in separate fashion and to ignore a solution which makes sense of them all by means of one idea . Such a solution is that the Pentateuch is a composite work of post-Mosaic date . The Pentateuch itself , it must be reiterated , makes no other claim . It has often been objected that there is no evidence elsewhere in ancient times of the existence of this kind of composite work . This objection can not be taken seriously . One need only examine the books of Kings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' used ' sources ' for his own purposes . Further illustrations are the book of Isaiah , the Psalms , Homer , the Gospels , and ( this has been insufficiently noted ) the Mishnah and the Talmud . The difficulties of the unhistorical nature of some of the Pentateuchal material , hard , indeed , to reconcile with the doctrine of divine dictation , have often been noted and were , in part , the cause of the Religion versus Science controversy in Victorian times , e.g. on the cosmogony of Genesis v. S. R. Driver : ' The Book of Genesis ' , in the Westminster Commentaries , Methuen , London , 1954 , pp. 19 f. and on the antiquity of man v. Driver , op. cit. , pp. xxxi f . We turn now to the solution of these difficulties advanced by modern scholars . It should be noted that two factors had their influence in determining the course of modern Biblical criticism . The first of these was the progress made in Homeric studies where critical methods were applied with success . The second was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Oriental ' books , i.e. that it was futile to attempt to understand the question of how the Bible was composed without trying to see it against its Oriental background . In other words , the question is not how we would have written the Biblical books but how they were , in fact , compiled by  | their ancient authors . It has well been said by Ernest Trattner that in earlier times people saw the Bible from outside ' while the Bible scholarship of the past two hundred years is a tremendous attempt to see it from inside ' i.e. as the Bible describes itself . Although he is not entirely original , Jean Astruc is generally held to be the founder of modern Bible criticism . Astruc , a Catholic physician , probably of Jewish stock , anxious to defend the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch but bothered by the evidence of its composite nature , particularly in the book of Genesis , put forward the theory that Moses used ancient documents as the sources for his work . This theory was advocated by Astruc in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moyse se servit pour composer le livre de la Genese ' , published in 1753 . Astruc noticed that whole portions of Genesis use the divine name ' Elohim ( translated in English as God ' ) while in other portions the Tetragrammaton ( translated in English as the Lord ' ) is used . This led Astruc to suggest that one of the documents used by Moses was the Elohist ' i.e. the document describing the origins of the world in which God is referred to as " Elohim ' . Although this document is now part of the Pentateuch it can be detected apart from the other component parts of the Pentateuch . Astruc , indeed , believed that he could detect thirteen different documents from which Moses drew his material . Astruc 's theory is referred to in the history of criticism as The First Documentary Hypothesis ' . Eichorn added his contribution to the theory by detecting other criteria besides the divine names . Astruc 's Elohist document comprised the following chapters of Genesis : i. 1 ? ii . 3 ; v. 1 ? end ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 ; 19 ; 22 ; 24 ; viii . 1 ? 19 ; ix . 1 ? 10 ; 1 2 ; 16 f. ; 28 f. ; xi . 10 ? 26 ; xvii. 3 ? 27 . Other theories , building on the findings of Astruc and Eichorn , suggested that various fragments of documents were to be detected in the Pentateuch ( the Fragment Theory ' ) or that an original work of Moses had been enlarged at different times . But eventually two main documents were detected , the one using the divine name " Elohim ' , hence called E ' , the other using the Tetragrammaton , spelled in German JHWH , hence called . Now it had long been recognised that the book of Deuteronomy differed in style and language from the other books  | of the Pentateuch . Furthermore , various ancient authors had held that the book found in the Temple in the days of Josiah ( 621 B.C.E. ) which caused the king to introduce his reformation ( v. II Kings , Chapters xxii and xxiii ) was the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his graduation dissertation at Jena University , entitled Discourse on Deuteronomy ' , in which he claimed that Deuteronomy was a work compiled shortly before its finding in the days of Josiah . Thus , three documents were now recognised in the Pentateuch and were given the symbols E ' , J ' and . ' E ' was looked upon as the main document ( the Foundation Document ' ) with and as additions . Each of the three documents was held to have been compiled at a different time . At first it seemed as if E ' comprised all the legal material in the books of Exodus , Leviticus and Numbers . J ' was held to be a later supplement and a still later one . But Hupfeld ( ' Quellen der Genesis ' , Berlin , 1853 ) pointed out that E ' itself contains duplicates and discrepancies ( e.g. the name Beth-El is explained differently in the two E ' sources of Gen. xxviii and Gen. xxxv , also the name Israel in the two E ' sources of Gen. xxxii. 24 ? 29 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existence of two E ' documents . The second of these was called P ' ( Priestly document ' because of the priestly nature of its content ) and Graf argued that ' P ' was both the framework of the rest of the Pentateuch and its latest document . Wellhausen described the dating and history of the four documents with great erudition , so that the Second Documentary Hypothesis ' is known as the Graf-Wellhausen Hypothesis ' . On this view the four documents , which once existed separately , were combined by a series of Redactors ' or editors , to whom the symbol was given . First there was a prophetic Redactor who combined J and E so skilfully that it is sometimes difficult to detect the two apart . Subsequent Redactors edited the other documents which were eventually welded into our present Pentateuch . The question of dating the four documents is very complicated . Briefly , the followers of the Documentary Hypothesis point to the following facts in attempting to ascertain the dates . ( a ) The prophets refer to the narratives of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeremiah , to the laws of the main part . ( b ) Jere-  | miah does refer to the laws but always to those in Deuteronomy. ( c ) Jeremiah and Deuteronomy know of no distinction between priests and Levites but Ezekiel knows of the distinction . Leviticus ( = P ) knows also of a High Priest ' . Hence the chronological order of the documents is held to be : ( 1 ) JE , ( 2 ) D , ( before Jeremiah ) , ( 3 ) P , ( after Ezekiel ) . On De Wette 's contention we know the approximate date of Deuteronomy . We are able , therefore , to construct the following chronological scheme : ( 1 ) J ( c. 850 B.C.E. ) ( 2 ) E ( c. 750 ) Combined JE ( c. 650 ) ( 3 ) D ( c. 621 ) added by RD ( c. 550 ) ( 4 ) P ( c. 500 ? 450 ) RP ( c. 400 ) The book of Joshua was held to show signs of the same scheme , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the five books of the Pentateuch and the book of Joshua . It will be seen at once that this hypothesis suggests a complete reversal of the traditional view ; the Pentateuch , as we have it , being a later work than the prophets and influenced by their teaching . Stated baldly in this fashion the Wellhausen hypothesis seems altogether too artificial , even preposterous . But attention to the following details reveals that the theory is endowed with a high degree of plausibility , although , as we shall see , many more recent scholars have abandoned it , in part , at least . If we set side by side the two accounts of the sending away of Hagar it will be seen that apart from the different divine names used there are stylistic and theological differences between the two accounts . In ( Gen. xvi . 4 ? 14 ) the divine name used is the Tetragrammaton , the Hebrew word used for maidservant ' is shiphhah and God is depicted as being very near . In E ' ( Gen. xxi. 8 ? 21 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " Elohim ' , the Hebrew word for maidservant ' is ' amah , and God is depicted as more distant . Followers of the Documentary Hypothesis point out that there are characteristics such as these in the documents appearing together with a great degree of consistency . On the view that the Pentateuch  | is non-composite in character it is necessary to say not only that events such as the sending away of Hagar happened twice but that each sending away ' is described , for no apparent reason , in different styles . When these differences in style are noted in other duplicates , too , the only possible conclusion , even if it is not precisely Wellhausen 's , is that we do not have one account of two events but two accounts of one . The following characteristics have been detected in J , E , D , and P : ( 1 ) J Anthropomorphisms . A simple style . The divine name used ( before Moses ) is There is an occasional mention of angels but this is infrequent . There is an interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spies go to Hebron , Judah takes the lead in the Joseph story . ( Hence it is claimed that J ' originated in the South and the symbol is made to serve as representing , too , the tribe of Judah ) . ( 2 ) E Less anthropomorphic . Special interest in angels and dreams . Fond of scenes of blessings . The divine name used ( before Moses ) is E ' . There is a special interest in the North of Palestine , e.g Reuben takes the lead in the Joseph story , Joshua figures prominently , Beth-El and Shechem figure in the Jacob Story . ( Hence it is claimed that E ' originated in the North and the symbol E ' is applied also to represent the tribe of ' Ephraim ' ) . ( 3 ) D Interest in purity of religion . One sanctuary . Levites serve as priests . Humanitarian . Levite always counted among the needy ' together with the stranger ' because no special provision made for him ( as in P ' ) .  | ( 4 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genealogies . Transcendent view of God . Formal style . No sacrifices offered before Moses and Aaron . Only Kohanim ( ' priests ' ) , not Levites , offer sacrifices in the Temple . Tithes given to both priests and Levites , hence no reference to Levite ' together with stranger ' ( as in D ' ) because provision made through tithes . Knows of High Priest ' . If we proceed to examine the first chapter of Genesis ( ' P ' ) we notice some of these characteristics . The divine name used is ' Elohim . The style is of a majestic formalism . The view of God is transcendent . The whole is a sublime description of God as Creator and appears to suggest a liturgical composition ( which it may well have been ) for recitation by the priests in the Temple . In chapter five of Genesis , to give one further example , we find the same formalistic style , the same use of the divine name , and the same setting out of the material in carefully measured periods . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ii ? iii the style is totally different . God is here very near to man . The view of God is anthropomorphic . ( This is not to say that J ' takes the descriptions of God walking in the garden ' or breathing ' literally , only that J ' is concerned with describing the Deity in the most vivid terms ) . The style is impressionistic ' rather than formal . There is a great interest in human psychology . Another example may be given to illustrate D ' and P ' . There are two passages in the Pentateuch containing the detailed laws governing manslaughter , one in Numbers ( chapter xxxv ) , the other in Deuteronomy ( chapter xix. 1 ? 13 ) . The two most striking differences between the passages are the provision in Numbers for the cities of the Levites to act as refuge cities and the law there concerning the death of the High Priest . Now on the Documentary Hypothesis the differences are explicable for D ' does not know of a High Priest ' and the Levites offer sacrifices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Numbers belongs )  | there is a High Priest ' and the Levites do not offer sacrifices . It is impossible , even absurd , to try , as some scholars once did , to apply these criteria to every verse in the Pentateuch , but the claim of the Documentary Hypothesis is that if they can be recognised even now so clearly this shows that they once existed , i.e. that the Pentateuch is a composite , not a homogeneous , work , although it has been fashioned into a unity by the work of the Redactors . The whole position has here found some severe criticism . Does it not make of the Redactor an imbecile ? Did he not see that he was combining different accounts with discrepancies and contradictions ? This is to fail to see that Oriental compilers did just that and we must not judge their methods by ours . A modern historian also uses sources but he recasts them entirely in a style and language of his own . Ancient writers frequently preferred to dovetail the sources into each other , sometimes placing two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving the joints ' showing . We have noted earlier the example of the book of Chronicles and that of the Mishnah . All in all , there can be no denying that the Documentary Hypothesis , as described in minute detail by Wellhausen and his followers , is a work of extraordinary genius . That in the view of many more recent scholars it has had its day is only to be expected . The essence of a scientific approach to historical problems is that progress is constantly being made as a result of further investigation . The Documentary Hypothesis was put forward as a hypothesis to be tested . In the view of many scholars even today it is still the best way of accounting for the facts and will not be overthrown until a better way of accounting for them is found . In the view of others better ways have been found . But the new theories , too , take note of the facts in a way in which fundamentalism does not and they are as untraditional ' as the old . It is completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even abandoned by modern scholars they now proceed as if nothing had happened since the Middle Ages , as mistaken as it would be to suggest that because of Einstein 's critique of Newtonian physics we are back in the days of the alchemists . Before we go on to examine the new theories which have been advanced it is necessary for something to be said about the question of textual criticism .  | Textual criticism of the Bible is known as the Lower Criticism ' to distinguish it from the Higher Criticism ' , the name given to the analysis of the composition and dating of the Biblical books . Up to now we have been considering the Higher Criticism ' . The terms , taken from Classical Studies , are perhaps unfortunate , implying , as they might seem to do , that scholars sit in judgment on the Bible and find it wanting . Actually , the proper aim of Higher Criticism is , as we have seen , to determine by whom the Biblical books were written and at which date . Far from sitting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible speak for itself . ( We might here repeat what has been said earlier that this does not mean that all modern scholars have been completely loyal to the ideal ? a difficult one to follow ? of pure , objective scholarship . Bias is particularly strong in Bible studies for the very reason that the Bible is tied up with man 's religious outlook ) . Textual or Lower Criticism seeks to establish the original text of the Biblical books . The implication of the ' Ani Ma'amin formulation of the eighth article of faith is that the present text found in the Scrolls of the Law in the Synagogue today is the identical text delivered to Moses . I believe with perfect faith that the whole Torah , now in our possession , is the same that was given to Moses our teacher , peace be unto him ' . Seen in this light ( Maimonides ' original formula is quite different ) the eighth article implies a belief in a completely infallible book protected from error not alone with regard to its contents but also with regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintained today by those totally unacquainted with the history of the Biblical text . The present Scrolls in the Synagogue are written in the square script known as ketabh ' ashuri , a term explained , as we shall see , in the Rabbinic literature . Another name for this script is , in fact , the square script ' ? ketabh meruba ' . The early Hebrew script was , however , different in form . This more ancient script is known in the Rabbinic literature as ketabh ibhri , Hebrew script ' , or ro'etz , a difficult term meaning possibly broken script ' after the manner in which its letters are formed . Tables showing the differences between the two scripts are to be found at the beginning of Gesenius ' Hebrew Grammar . The
