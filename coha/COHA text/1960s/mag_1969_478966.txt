You went to the verge , you say , and came back safely ? Some have not been so fortunate ? some have fallen . ? Conrad Aiken , " Prelude XIV " The village lies folded away in one of the shallow valleys which dip into the East Anglian coastal plain . It is not a particularly striking place and says little at first meeting . It is approached by a spidery lane running off by a handsome stretch of Roman road , apparently going nowhere . This road suggests one of those expensive planning errors which , although canceled in the books , will mark the earth forever . It is the kind of road which hurries one past a situation . Centuries of traffic must have passed within yards of Akenfield without noticing it . It is a " round " village , with the houses lining the edges of the perimeter lanes , but with shops , church , pub , school , chapel , spread along a central road following the bank of a creek officially known as the Potsford River but called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the village remains self-contained and quiet in spite of farm machines . motor-bikes , and the dull murmur of Ronald Blythe lives only a mile away from the locale of his book , " Report from an English Village , " from which this portrait is taken .

There is , in the bony quiet of their faces , not insularity or an absence of response , but a rational notion of " first things first , " as they say . The peculiarly English social revolution which began immediately after the first world war has dramatically changed the countryman 's life , though not nearly so dramatically as that of his cousin in the town . He has his Sixties ' comforts and luxuries , as well as a fair inkling of popular Sixties ' cultures , but these things , though grabbed for by one who has a long memory of bleakness , are apt to be regarded as trimmings . The earth itself has its latest drugs and fertilizers poured into it to make it rich and yielding , but it is still the " old clay . " In both its and his reality , the elemental quality remains uppermost . Science is a footnote to what he really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The villager may be anyone from an old horseman who , aeons away in social-change time , belonged to a family used serf-fashion as a fieldgang , to a rich agricultural technician for whom the word " farmer " is beginning to sound a quaint description ; yet both will be one in the great division which separates the growers from the mere consumers of food the world over . Deep in the nature of such men and elemental to their entire being there is the internationalism of the planted earth which makes them , in common with the riceharvesters of Vietnam or the wine-makers of Burgundy , people who are committed to certain basic ideas and actions which progress and politics can elaborate or confuse , but can never alter . In Akenfield , evidence of the good life , a tall old church on the hillside , a pub selling the local brew , a pretty stream , a football pitch , a handsome square vicarage with a cedar of Lebanon shading it , a school with jars of tadpoles in the window , three shops with doorbells , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of quaint cottages , is there for all to recognize . Akenfield , on the face of it . is the kind of place in which an Englishman has always felt it his right and duty to live . It is patently the real country , untouched and genuine . A holy place , when you have spent half your life abroad in the services . Its very sounds are formal , hieratic. ; larks , clocks , bees , tractor hummings . Rarely the sound of the human voice . The villager who has never moved away from his birthplace for anything more than military service retains the unique mark of his particular village . If a man says that he comes from Akenfield he knows that he is telling someone from another part of the neighborhood a good deal more than this . Anything from his appearance to his politics could be involved . But on the whole the villagers do n't volunteer much about themselves . They are not loquacious people . On the whole , they will admit certain information about their lives during the " bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customs as makeweight , but they remain intrinsically private folk and their characters can not be termed open . The young men are beginning to realize that the farming scene has no future for them unless they happen to be farmers ' sons and can inherit . The middle-aged workers bore them with their tales of **30;2550;TOOLONG but the more intelligent teen-ager has already discovered that his farming life must in essence be his father 's farming life repeatedplus sufficient training to allow him to cope with the new agricultural machinery . What most modern farms need is a good tractor driver or two , as once they needed good plowmen ? or horsemen , as they were called in Suffolk ? and for the majority of farm workers this job has to be the ceiling of their expectations . Agriculture is one of Britain 's crucial industries but its skilled workers are the lowest paid and , socially , lowly rated . In East Anglia it remains embedded in a conservatism as heavy as the clay lands themselves . The old farmsteads , neat and trim , ride high on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing project thrusts up to meet them . And this is not likely here . One or two new houses have gone up recently , usually in the depths of the valley and at the side of the stream and its meadows , where a millennium of villagers have preferred not to live . This , on the quiet face of it , is as ordinary a group of country folk as one would meet anywhere in 1967 . Or is it ? How much is preserved ? How much lost ? Leonard Thompson . aged seventy-one , and his wife live in a solitary house in the village which stands not more than a yard of the Roman road . The mixture of fragility and tenacity which marks the cottage is somehow indicative of Len himself . Although there is nothing particularly frail about him in the physical sense ? he is a little brown bull of a man with hard blue eyes and limbs so stretched by toil that they seem incapable of relaxing into retirement ? he has stood firmly in the apocalyptic path of events which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unsentimental , and realistic . He is neither proud nor regretful to have endured the bad times . He is political and holds large , simple convictions which make a lot of today 's social hopefulness sound oddly irrelevant . In fact , his evident political nature ' mikes him untypically East Anglian , for politics on the corn plain are notoriously vague , furtive , and unreal . Len is also an extraordinarily interesting survivor of Britain 's village Lost Generation , that mysterious army of horsemen , plowmen , and field workers who fled the wretchedness of the farms in 1914 . The army had provided ? along with the railways ? an escape route for many years before this , but it was the first world war which swept Len and his contemporaries off the hated land to conditions which forced the thinking countryman to decide to halt a system of degradation when they returned . The climate of the Twenties and Thirties suited Len perfectly for what he had to 48 ENGLAND 'S CRUEL EARTH do . The first world war had given those who survived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the village farmers their virtual ownership of the laborers and their f amities . He organized the union branch.One sees him , a fine old man , doing his utmost to comprehend the foreign place in which he happened to have been born . Grandchildren arrive during the university holidays . Nephews and nieces fly in from Canada , while the ash at the end of the road , which marked the last point at which soldier and emigrant sons could turn and wave before ? calking the miles to Ipswich to catch the train to Gallipoli or Quebec , still blocks the view . Through the tape recorder Len speaks for himself . There were ten of us in the family and as my father was a farm laborer earning thirteen shillings a week you can just imagine how we lived . I will tell you the first thing which I can remember . It was when I was three ? about 1899 . We were all sitting round the fire waiting for my soldier brother to come home ? he was the eldest boy in the family . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride all the way from Ipswich station in a milk-cart . This young man came in , and it was the first time I had seen him . He wore a red coat and looked very lively . Mother got . up and kissed him but Father just sat and said , " How are you ? " Then we had tea , all of us staring at my brother . It was dark , it was the wintertime . A few days later he walked away and my mother stood right out in the middle of the road , watching . He was going to fight in South Africa . He walked smartly down the lane until his red coat was no bigger than a poppy . Then the tree hid him . We never saw him again . He went all through the war but caught enteric fever afterwards and died . He was twenty-one . Very soon after this it was very hard living indeed for the family . There were seven children at home and Father 's wages had been reduced to ten shillings a week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a scrubbed brick floor and just one rug made of scraps of old clothes pegged into a sack . The cottage had a living room , a larder , and two bedrooms . Six of us boys and girls slept in one bedroom and our parents and the baby slept in the other . There was no newspaper and nothing to read except the Bible . All the village houses were like this . Our food was apples , potatoes , swedes , and bread , and we drank our tea without milk or sugar . Skim milk could be bought from the farm but it was thought a luxury . Nobody could getenough to eat no matter how they tried . Two of my brothers were out to work . One was eight years old and he got three shillings a week , the other got about seven . Our biggest trouble was water . There was no water near , it all had to be fetched from the foot of a hill nearly a mile away . " Drink all you can at school , " we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You would see the boys and girls filling themselves up like camels before they left school so that they would have enough water to last the day . I always remember the bitter metal taste of the tap in my mouth ; it was coldbeautiful ! I remember once coming home from school and feeling almost mad for water . My mother was washing the linen an the doorstep and when her back was turned 1 swigged two cupfuls from the tub . Up it came at once ? it was all soapsuds ! Mother did no more than box my ears . That is how they thought about you at that time . Our parents and all the cottage people were very religious and very patriotic . The patriotic songs and the church hymns seemed equally holy . They took our breath away . The boys marched through the village singing , Lords Roberts and Kitchener , Generals Buller and White , All dressed in khaki , going out to fight .. . and their faces would look sincere and important . It was all " my country " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no music in the village then except at the chapel or the church and our family liked it so much that we hurried from one to the other to hear all we could . People like us , who went where we fancied on a Sunday . were called " Devil-dodgers . " We all went to one service after another and ate packets of bread and jam in between . People believed in religion then , which I think was a good thing because if they had n't got religion there would have been a revolution . Nobody would have stuck it . Religion disciplined us and gave us the strength to put up with things . The parson was very respected . He could do what he liked with us when he felt like it . One day he came to our house and told my eldest sister . who was eleven , to leave school . " I think you need n't finish , " he said . " You can go and be maid to old Mrs. Barney Wickes , now she has lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sister was paid a penny a day out of Parish Relief to look after her . People were strict . Parents were strict . All the village children thought of was how to get away , how to " get on . " But we had our games and treats . We had a game called " Hudney . " A stone was placed on a brick and had to be knocked off by another stone when it was thrown at it . When you ran to retrieve the stone a boy would try and hit you with a hall and if he did you were out of the game . We played this for hours on end . We had no toys , no books , and we did n't play cricket or football . But all the boys and young men swam naked in the river in the summertime . It was our biggest happiness . Boys were washed until they were about two , then their bodies did n't see water again until they learned to swim . We did n't look dirty . We were healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great desires was to have cake . Nearly all our food was boiled on account of there being no oven in most of the cottages . A " treat " was any party where you could eat cake . I walked two miles to school . There were so many children you could hardly squeeze in the room . All the same , it was very cold in the winter . Most of the boys had suits and boots on with nothing underneath . Every now and then we used to have to stand on the outside of our desks and mark time to get our circulation back . We did left-right , left-right for about five minutes ? good God , what a row we made ! Later on , I heard this sound again in Gallipoli . It seemed homely and familiar . We must have been bashing some landing-stage . The school was useless . The farmers came and took boys away from it when they felt like it ; the parson raided it for servants . The teacher was a respectable woman who did her best . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us the news . I looked forward to leaving school so that I could get educated . I knew that education was in books , not in school ; there were no books there . I was a child when I left but I already knew that our " learning " was rubbish , that our food was rubbish , and that I should end as rubbish if I did n't look out . When I was six we moved to another house . It was a tied cottage with a thatched roof and handsome beams . My father said , " We shall be better off , boys ; we shall have a nice spring over water just across the road , and that will be a great relief . Also we shall have a nice big garden with two apple trees , a Doctor Harvey and a Blenheim Orange . " We moved to this house in 1904 , As soon as we got there Mother went stone-picking in the fields ... because we had to buy some new clothes . We helped her when we got back from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-four bushels of stones a day to get two shillings . Each parish had to mend its own lanes then and the stones were used for this . A tumbril was put in the field and a line was chalked round it . When you had filled it up to the line you got the two shillings . It would take the whole day . We did it every minute we were n't at school and all through the holidays . It was all I can remember . But during the harvest holiday we had a change ? gleaning . The women would meet and say , " Is Starlets ready for gleaning yet ? Is Great Moses ? " ? these were the names of the fields . They meant , not has the field been cut but have they cleared the " policeman . " The policeman was the name given to the last stook Lshock which the farmers would leave standing in the middle of the field so they could have time to rake up all the loose corn they could before the gleaners arrived . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting and one night a young man stole the " policeman . " The next morning the gleaners hurried in and gleaned masses ? the field had n't been raked , you see . The whole village was laughing ? except the farmer . He raked up quick the next year , I can tell you ! Igleaned all my boyhood . I ran away from it once but came to grief , and since the results have been with me all my life , I will tell you about it . When I was six I got fed up with being in the gleaning field with all the women , so I ran off to help the boy who worked the cattle-cake machine . In no time my hand was caught and my fingers were squashed . The farmer was just coming up by the granary on his horse when he heard me screaming . " What have you been up to , you young scamp ? " he shouted . " My fingers ? they 're in the cake-breaker ! " And he said ? I shall never forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But when he saw my hand he changed his tune and said , " Get up to the house . " The farmer 's wife tied some rag round my hand and took me home and my mother wheeled me miles to the doctor 's in a pram . My sister was home from service , so she came with us and held me while the doctor scraped the grease out of my wounds with a knife , stitched up one finger , cut another , pared it like a stick and tied what was left to the hone and then moved on to the next finger . I lifted the roof , I can tell you . There was no anesthetic , nothing . My sister began to faint and the doctor got onto her something terrific . " Damn silly girl ? clear off outside if you ca n't stand it ! Fetch my groom in . " So the groom came and held me until it was finished . All the time the doctor worked he shouted . " What did you do it for ? Why ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used pity then , and especially not to children , and particularly not to boys . The farmer told my father and he said " I 'll give him something to think about when I get home ! " It was harvest so it was late when he returned . " Where 's 50 ENGLAND 'S CRUEL EARTH that boy Leonard ? " he said , " I 'm going to give him a good hiding . " " He 's gone to bed , he 's had enough , " said Mother . My father did n't realize how bad it was , you see . The tops of three of my fingers had been cut off . So he did n't touch me . There were a lot of hidings then . My father was a good man and did n't like giving them to us , but some people did . Father never smoked or drank , and he looked after his children . He had a wonderful character in the parish . He would go to work with three-quarters of a loaf of bread and a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but when we ran to meet him after his day 's work , he would give us the cheese . He had saved it for us . " I can do without that , " he would say . We were thrashed a lot at school . Fathers would be ordered to the school to hold their sons while the mistress thrashed them . Most teachers were big thrashers . But we were tough , very tough . I left school when I was thirteen , on April 20 when the corn was low . I helped my mother pulling up docks in the Big Field for a shilling an acre , which my mother took . She could see that I was too big to have money taken from me like this , so when the farmer came round she said , " Ca n't you give my boy a proper job ? " She meant a regular job with a wage . But the farmer just laughed and rode away . So the next week I tried my luck at another farm . Mr. Wakeling , this farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about eighteen to twenty-one who were all over six feet . They all stood looking down at . me and smiling . " So you are thirteen and you have left school , but what can you do ? " " I can do anything . " " Well , there 's a mangold field over there ? you do that . " " What are you going to get ? " asked my mother when I told her . " I never asked and he never said , " I replied . It was the beginning of being grown-up . I had a week in this field , singling mangolds , and I did well because I had often done the job before after school . The farmer came and looked and said , " You 've done very well , my little man . How much have I got to give you ? " " My mother said half-a-crown but perhaps you would sooner give me a rise . " But the farmer thought half-acrown was good , which was what I got for sixty hours ' work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing the milking , and who was seventeen and strong , was told to load corn and I had to take over the cows , The farmer 's riding ponies and then his son 's ponies were added . Then the farmer said , " You 'll have to work Sundays now , but I shall be giving you another sixpence . So I got three shillings a week . Mother said , " How lucky you are ! " Shortly after this my father came to grief with his farmer and we had to leave the tied cottage . We moved down by the river and when we were settled Father took my brother and myself to his new employer and , twizzling me round so that I could be seen , said , " Here 's a good strong boy . I want four and six a week for him . " " We 'll see about that at the end of the week , " said the farmer . Then my father made my brother stand forward ? he was fifteen ? and said , " Look what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him . " The farmer thought for a minute , looked us up and down and said , " All right . " The second week that I was at this new farm I had to drive a herd of cattle to Ipswich . I was thirteen and had lived only ten miles away all my life , but I had never been to this big town before . The farmer went ahead in his trap and waited for me at Ipswich market . He sold the cows and bought some more , and told me to drive them back to the farm . Most of my work was like this , walking cattle along the roads backwards and forwards to the market ? about twenty-five miles a day . The farmer was a dealer . I stayed with him a year and four months and was paid four shillings sixpence a week . And then I got into a hell of a row . I 'd driven a flock of sheep from Ipswich and the next morning they found that one had died . The farmer was in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother on her way to chapel and told her all about it . He had driven the sheep too hard , he said . " And you drive boys too hard ! " said my mother ? she had no fear at all . Well , the truth of the matter is that she said a lot of things she 'd only thought until then , and so I left the farm . It must seem that there was war between farmers and their men in these days . I think there was , particularly in Suffolk . These employers were famous for their meanness . They took all they could from the men and boys who worked their land . They bought their life 's strength for as little as they could . They wore us out without a thought because , with the big families , there was a continuous supply of labor . Fourteen young men left the village in 1909-11 to join the army . There was n't a recruiting drive , they just escaped . And some people just changed their sky , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week in the Suffolk Chronicle and Mercury there was an advertisement which said , " Lads for Yorkshire . Milk or Plowing , Good Homes . Fares Paid . Apply : Woods of Stowmarket . " All the Yorkshire farm workers , you see , had left the land to work in the factories and mills . So they hit on this idea of getting workers up from Suffolk , where things were desperate , to cultivate the Yorkshire farms . So I thought , right , I 'll go ! I was getting nine shillings a week for a seventyfive-hour week in a cowshed . I had four hours off a week . from ten to two on a Sunday . So I went to Yorkshire . I met Mr. Woods on Bury St. Edmunds station and he gave me my ticket . I went to a farm in the West Riding . It was the first time I had been away from home . I lived in a little old room on the farm with two other boys and was told that I would get ? 12 at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week but also my food and keep . The food was good ; we ate it with the servant in the kitchen . We worked like little donkeys until we were a bit unsteady on our feet , then it was bed . Then work . 1 had to pay a pound a year to an old woman to do my washing , pay a pound to get home again and a pound for boots and corduroys , but I came to Suffolk with eight golden sovereigns in my hand and felt a millionaire . Ireturned to my old farm at Akenfield for eleven shillings a week , but I was unsettled . When the farmer stopped my pay because it was raining and we could n't thrash . I said to my seventeen-yearold mate , " Bugger him . Well go off and join the army . " It was March 4 , 1914 . We joined the army a few hours after we had made our decision . We walked to Ipswich and got the train to Colchester . We were soaked to the skin but very happy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shilling . The recruiting sergeant said , " You ca n't go home in all this rain , you can sleep in a bed in the recruiting room . " In the morning he said . " Go home and say goodbye , and here 's ten shillings each for your food and fares . Report back on Monday . " In my four months ' training with the regiment I put on nearly a stone in weight and got a bit taller . They said it was the food but it was really because for the first time in my life there had been no strenuous work . I want to say this simply as a fact , that village people in Suffolk in my day were worked to death . It literally happened . It is not a figure of speech . I was worked mercilessly . I am not complaining about it . It is what happened to me . We were all delighted when war broke out on August 4 . I was now a machine-gunner in the Third Essex Regiment . A lot of boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sleeping in ditches at Harwich , wrapped in our greatcoats , we were bursting with happiness . We were all damned glad to have got off the farms . I had seven shillings a week and sent my mother half of it . If you did this , the government would add another three shillings sixpence ? so my mother got seven . My father died early this year and my mother lived on this seven shillings a week for the whole of the war , adding a scrap to it by doing washing and weeding in the fields . Neither of my parents lived long enough to draw the Old Age Pension . I can remember , when work was short , a group of unemployed young men coming to where some old men were sugar-beeting , which is the worst job there is , and shouting , " Now that you grandfathers have got the pension " ? it was five shillings a week ? " why do n't you get out of the field and give us a chance ? " These " old " men were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made them ancient . All this trouble with the village fell behind us now . I was nineteen and off to the Dardanelles , which is the Hellespont , I discovered , I had two boys from the village with me . We 'd heard a lot about France so we thought we 'd try Turkey . The band played on the banks of the river as we pulled out of Plymouth and I wondered if we would ever come home again . We were all so patriotic then and had been taught to love England in a fierce kind of way . The village was n't England ; England was something better than the village .... We arrived at the Dardanelles and saw the guns flashing and heard the rifle fire . They heaved our ship . the firer Clyde , right up to the shore . They had cut a hole in it and made a little pier , so we were able to walk straight off and onto the beach . We all sat there ? on the Hellespont ! ? waiting for it to get light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns , the second a big marquee . It did n't make me think of the military but of the village fetes . Other people must have thought like this because I remember how we all rushed up to it , like boys getting into a circus , and then found it all laced up . We unlaced it and rushed in . It was full of corpses . Dead Englishmen , lines and lines of them , and with their eyes wide open . We all stopped talking . I 'd never seen a dead man before and here I was looking at two or three hundred of them . It was our first fear . Nobody had mentioned this . I was very shocked . I thought of Suffolk and it seemed a happy place for the first time . Later that day we marched through open country and came to within a mile and half of the front line . It was incredible . We were there ? at the war ! The place we had reached was called " dead ground " because it was where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square holes , myself next to James Sears from the village .

" Ernie ? ? he 's 52 ENGLAND 'S CRUEL EARTH gone . " " Have you seen Albert Paternoster ? " ? " Albert ? ? he 's gone . " We learned that if three hundred had " gone " but seven hundred were left , then this was n't too bad . We then knew how unimportant our names were . I was on sentry that night . A chap named Scott told me that I must only put my head up for a second but that in this time I must see as much as I could . Every third man along the trench was a sentry . The next night we had to move on to the third line of trenches and we heard that the Gurkhas were going over and that we had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication trench we found it so full of dead men that we could hardly move . Their faces were quite black and you could n't tell Turk from English . There was the most terrible stink and for a while there was nothing but the living being sick onto the dead . I did sentry again that night . It was onetwo-sentry , one-two-sentry all along the trench , as before . I knew the next sentry up , quite well . I remembered him in Suffolk singing to his horses as he plowed . Now he fell back with a great scream and a look of surprise ? dead . It is quick , anyway , I thought .. On June 4 we went over the top . We took the Turks ' trench and held it . It was called Hill 13 . The next day we were relieved and told to rest for three hours , but it was n't more than half an hour before the relieving regiment came running back . The Turks had returned and recaptured their trench . On June 6 my favorite officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we managed to get hold of Hill 13 again . We found a great muddle , carnage and men without rifles shouting , " Allah ! Allah ! " which is God 's name in the Turkish language . Of the sixty men I had started out to war from Harwich with , there were only three left . We set to work to bury people . We pushed them into the sides of the trench but bits of them kept getting uncovered and sticking out , like people in a badly made bed . Hands were the worst ; they would escape from the sand , pointing , begging ? even waving ! There was one which we all shook when we passed , saying , " Good morning , " in a posh voice . Everybody did it . The bottom of the trench was springy like a mattress because of all the bodies underneath . At night , when the stench was worse , we tied crepe round our mouths and noses .

We believed the fighting had got to be done . We were fighting for England . You only had to say " England " to stop any argument . We shot and shot . On August 6 they made a landing at Suvla Bay and we took Hill 13 again , and with very few casualties this time . We 'd done a. good job . The trench had been lost yet again , you see .

We were taken to Lille , where the Germans had to make us ill and wretched in a week in order to march us through the town , so that they could say to the people . " Look at the great British army , look what it has been reduced to ! " We were driven into dark dungeons , straight off the battlefield , starved , made filthy , and in only six days we were ill and looked like scarecrows .... At Christmas 1917 they took us to Germany , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in rags . No shoes . They gave us wooden clogs . We dug on the Kiel railway , making a track to the Baltic for the big guns . Many people died . On November 5 , 1918 , some German sailors arrived and set us free . They cut all the barbed wires and left just one guard in charge . You can leave if you like , " they said . " The war will soon be over . There is going to be a revolution , so keep off the roads . You could go and help the farmers pick up potatoes . That would be sensible . " So this is what we did . And when the war ended , there we were , Germans , Poles , Russians , and Englishmen , working in the fields and realizing that there was damn little growing in them . The soldiers who got back to the village recovered very quickly . People who had lost their sons felt strange . Generally speaking , we were thankful that it was all over and we could get back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were different . The farm workers who had been soldiers were looked at in a new way . There were a few more privileges around than there used to be . They 'd let you take a rabbit or two , for instance . Before 1914 , if you 'd caught a rabbit , my God , the world would have come to an end ! The sack was the least you 'd get . We felt that there must be no slipping back to the bad old ways and about 1920 we formed a branch of the Agricultural Laborers ' Union . Nineteen-twenty looked like being a good year . The awards made by the Central Wages Board were enforced in the spring and we were getting 38 shillings sixpence a week on the farms . We worked fifty-four hours a week and had a halfholiday . What a change from 1914 , when it was thirteen shillings a week and just enough grub and sleep to keep you on the move ! The farmers were able to pay the new wages because of the prices guaranteed by the Corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were diddling them , Only two or three hundred men belonged to the Union before the war , now thousands and thousands joined . This was the summer one of our members , Mr. Edwards , won South Norfolk for Labor . He was the second farm worker to get into Parliament . We were so pleased with the way things were going that we felt we must consolidate . We had never had anything before , you see . We felt glad but unsafe . So we demanded fifty shillings a week and said that we would strike if we did n't get it . Then things began to go wrong . It had nothing to do with the strike plans . The slump set in during the great hot summer of 1921 . I remember it well . We had no rain from March right through to October . The corn did n't grow no more than a foot high and most of it did n't even come to the ear . We harvested what we could and the last loads were leaving the field when we heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was true . The farmers told the men that they would be given 42/6 . Then it was 38/6 . A fortnight later on the farm where I worked it was , " You 'll have to be on short-time ? the boss can only afford to give you 2716 a week . " And that is what we lived on all that bad winter . It was the government 's fault . They ended the Corn Act less than a year after it had been made law . They said it was best if the farmers made their own bargains , which meant that they would n't pay the subsidies . The price of wheat was quartered in a year . Cattle were sold for next to nothing because the farmers could n't afford to keep them . The farmers became broke and frightened , so they took it out on us men . We reminded them that we had fought in the war , and they reminded us that they had too ! So it was hate all round . Then we had to close down our Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week membership fee . I remember the week this happened . I drew 2716 from the farmer and after I had given my wife twenty-four and paid my Union fourpence and my rent 3/1 , I had a penny left ! So I threw it across the field . I 'd worked hard , I 'd been through the war , and I 'd married . A penny was what a child had . I was n't having that . I would sooner have nothing . The farmers were utterly against the Union and utterly against the Wages Board . Now , in our village , we had no Union , no Board ? nobody to look after us . Sixteen men fell out of work but there was no dole for farm laborers . An unemployed married farm worker got parish relief but a single man got nothing . So the young men began to walk to the other villages , searching for odd jobs . Soon East Anglia was full of these men and by 1930 or so , you 'd get up to fifty of them passing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The farmers knew about our Union activities from their grooms and gardeners , who had always reckoned themselves above the men who worked in the fields . They would return from the pub and tell their masters all they had heard . There would be fights sometimes between the field workers and the farmers ' creepers . It took a brave man to show his politics in Suffolk all through the Thirties . If you were n't a Tory you were a troublemaker . All the same , we got the Union going again in 1934 . Things changed after this , first very slowly , then faster and faster . I am old now . I read library books about the Great War ? my war . The one I am reading now is called The Sword-Bearers . I have these deep lines on my face because I have worked under fierce suns.
