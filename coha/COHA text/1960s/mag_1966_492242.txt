THAT NEW SOUND FROM NASHVILLE By Charles Portis ashville , the Athens of theSouth. is home to Vanderbilt University . Fisk University and at least half a dozen other colleges , as well as a symphony orchestra . a concrete replica of the Parthenon and a downtown beer joint called Tootsie 's Orchid Lounge . Tootsie 's is where the country-music people hang out  --  those who do n't object to beer joints . It has a very active jukebox and shaky tables , and there are 8-by-I0 glossies all over the wall and a clutter of small-bore merchandise behind the counter  --  stuff like gum , beef sticks and headache powder . The hostess is Tootsie Bess , a motherly , aproned woman who does n't mind noise or a certain amount of rowdiness , but whose good nature has its limits . One night a drunk songwriter addressed Maggie . the cook , as " nigger. " and Tootsie threw him out and banned him . She has three cigar boxes full of I.O.U . ' s . On Saturday nights , performers on the Grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alley and go in the back door of Tootsie 's to get aholt of themselves between sets with some refreshing suds . Songwriters ?

Roger Miller i King of the Road ) , the antic poet who was too far out to have any success on the Opry itself , was singing and clowning in Tootsie 's back room years ago , for free . " He wrote Dang Me right here in this booth , " says Tootsie . But his rates are stiffer now . He just did a special for NBC-TV and is talking with them about starring in a series next year . " Yeah , Roger 's doing all right . " says a Nashville business associate . " He was in here the other day with a quarter of a million dollars in his pocket . It was two checks .

La. , with a guitar across his back and white cotton socks rolled down in little cylinders atop his grease-resistant work shoes . And a song in his heart about teardrops. adultery , diesel trucks . This is the milieu of commercial country music , the Southern honky-tonk , Sometimes it 's called " hillbilly music . " which is only half accurate , because the southern lowlanders have contributed just as much as the hill folks , perhaps more ; and sometimes " country and western . " which is misleading because such of it as reflects the culture a est of Abilene , Tex. , tends to be pretty thin stuff . " Southern white working-class music " would never do as a tag . but that 's what it is . By any name , country music is prospering , and so is Nashville 's recording industry . which now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for almost two years . packed a carpetbag recently and went to Nashville and came back with a hit single , Dream On , Little Dreamer , by two country-music writers . and a hit album , The Scene Changes . The golf was good too , he says . Both RCA Victor and Columbia have built big new studios there in the past year , and all sorts of unlikely people  --  Al Hirt , Ann-Margret  --  are going there to record . Elvis Presley always has . It is odd in a way that the country-music business should have settled in Nashville . instead of in a rougher , rawer town like , say , Shreveport . : Shreveport does have a lesser version of the Opry called " The Louisiana Hayride . " ) Nashville is an old town ( 17801 , a state capital , a college town . and a headquarters town for southern churches . There are some 200,000 people in the city proper . It is a pleasant , green , genteel , residential place on the banks of the Cumberland River in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Sidney Lanier and Allen Tate , and now it has Ernest Tubb and does n't quite know what to do with him , except ignore him . Few country singers manage to get themselves taken seriously in Nashville . Eddy Arnold is a big community man , and he is being discussed as a Democratic nominee for governor next year . Roy Acuff ran for governor as a Republican , unsuccessfully . But generally , the Athenians of the South go one way , and the country-music people another . Less than 10 percent of the Opry audiences come from the Nashville area . Middle-class Nashvillians , anxious lest they be mistaken for robes , are quick to inform the visitor that they have never attended the show . it is not for them , this hoedown . They long for road-company presentations of socket Broadway comedies . Even radio station WSM , which carries the Opry , is not really a country-music station . " Oh , no , " says Ott Devine , WSM 's Opry manager . " Except for the Opry and a few record shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there the business has , and it now brings in some $60 million a year to the town . From the Opry it has grown into a complex of 10 recording studios . 26 record companies . and a colony of 700 cleffers , 265 music publishers , and 1,000 union musicians , about half of whom can read music with some facility . Nashville has replaced Chicago as the country 's third-busiest recording center , after New York and Hollywood , and is probably ahead of Hollywood . says RCA Victor vice president Steve Sholes. " in the production of successful single records . " The main reason is that it has developed its own style , what outsiders call The Nashville Sound . " Nobody wants to define it , but it amounts to country music with a dash of Tin Pan Alley , in the form of non-country instruments like drums and trombones . The music , in its present form , is not really very old . It is a blend of British balladry , American folk songs , 19th-century Protestant hymns , Negro blues and gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if northern pop . There were important pioneers in the early 1920 's such as Vernon Dalhart t " I f l had the wings of an angel .. .. " 1 but for most practical purposes the music dates from 1927 when Jimmie Rodgers made his first record ( Victor : for a goldback $20 bill . Rodgers was The Blue Yodeler , The Singing Brakeman , He was a consumptive drifter from Meridian . Miss. , who , in a span of six years , established commercial country music as a distinct new form . He was not quite 36 years old when he coughed himself to death in a New York hotel room in 1933 . At the end he was so wasted and weakened with tuberculosis that he had to lie on a cot while recording at Victor 's 24th Street studio in New York . He left a legacy of 112 songs , many of them classics like My Carolina Sunshine Gal , Pin in the Jailhouse Now , and With a strong assist from The Carter Family Wildwood Flower , Wabash Cannon Ball ; Rodgers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ole Opry formalized it and gave it a home . The Opry is the mother church . Actually this show predates Rodgers 's recording career by two years , but in the beginning it was only a fiddler 's show , and it was n't until later that it took on its present form as a singin ' and pickin ' jamboree . I n the 1930 's the music remained pretty well localized in the South and Midwest . except for the hemispheric exposure it was given by the Mexican-border radio stations , beaming it out at 200.000 tube-shattering watts , the hillbilly songs sandwiched in between harangues from jackleg preachers and pitches for towels and chickens . ( " Send your card or letter to Baby Chicks ! That 's Baby Chicks ! Sorry , no guarantee of sex , breed or color . " 1 But it did n't get off the ground nationally until World War II , when the northern boys and city boys got strong doses of it in barracks and on decks and in southern camp towns . For those in uniform there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Mama and Detour and There 's a Star-Spangled Banner Wavin ' Somewhere . Some of the city boys developed a tolerance for it . a few even came to like it . In 1944 the USO polled GI 's in Europe to determine the most popular singer and , lo , Roy Acuff 's name led all the rest . It was much the same in Korea . There were few rifle companies in that war without a wind-up record player and a well-worn 78 rpm record of Hank Williams 's Lovesick Blurs . The Chinese even used the music in an attempt to make the American troops homesick , or maybe it was their idea of torture . For whatever reason , they set up giant speakers and boomed ditties like You Are Illy Sunshine across the valleys in the long watches of the night . The music soon went into eclipse again , as it had done after World War II , and it was n't until the /ate 1950 's that it began making its present comeback  --  this time with The Nashville Sound . The boom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low by rock roll .

" Things began to look up when Ferlin Husky made one called Gone . I think that was the first big one with the new sound . It had the beat and the piano and Jourdanaires . That 's the thing now , the beat . It used to he the song . " Others cite Marty Robbins 's .4 While Sport Coal or Sonny James 's Young Lore as the breakthrough tunes . All three records had a country flavor , but they were n't loo country ; they were country-pop hybrids that sold well in both markets . They had The Nashville Sound . They do n't call it that in Nashville , of course . They call it " uptown country , " as opposed to " hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still big on the Opry and on five A.M. snuff shows . Hillbilly is characterized by a squonking fiddle introduction . a funereal steel guitar and an overall whiney. draggy sound that has never set well with urban ears . The masterminds of The Nashville Sound have abandoned all that . They have smoothed out many of the rough edges likely to offend . They use sophisticated new chord progressions and , while the guitar remains the primary accompaniment  --  lead , rhythm , steel , 12-string  --  they have added piano , drums and choral voices , and anything that strikes their fancy  --  vibes , tenor sax , harpsichord , trombone . The prejudice against non-string instruments has largely gone by the way . Even the Opry now permits drums on the stage , though it is still holding the line against brass and woodwinds . So popular is the new sound that the number of country-music radio stations has increased from 81 to 200-plus in the past four years , and that includes several 50,000-watt heavyweights in places like Los Angeles tKGBS t and Chicago IWJJD ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Polynesians , northern and southern Italians , northern and southern Chinese , Moors , Scandinavians , Lithuanians and Romanians . but where you ca n't buy a decent plate of turnip greens . purple-hull peas and fried okra  --  even that market has been opened up . Since last September , IVJRZ in Newark , a former pop station , has been beaming Lefty Frizzell and Ferlin Husky across the Hudson all day and all night , and it has increased its audience 1,000 percent . " This music has a new acceptance and a new dignity , " says Harry Reith , the general manager of WJRZ . " It 's not , you know , the old hillbilly stuff , the nasal voices , those guitars thumping and all . Our mail response has been fantastic . " Few people can agree on precisely what The Nashville Sound is. but there is pretty general agreement as to who the masterminds are  --  namely . Chet Atkins , Victor 's Artist and Repertoire man in Nashville ; Owen Bradley , A-and-R man there for Decca ; and Don Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guiding hand in record production . He matches the song with the singer and directs recording sessions  --  so far as anyone can he said to " direct " a session in Nashville . Ile picks the recordings to be released and the ones to be shelved . He puts albums together . Chet Atkins , who may be the best guitarist in the country , is a quiet , introspective man who sits tieless in a plush executive office on Nashville 's Music Row and reflects on such things as posture as a key to character . - Look at me , " he says , as though trying to puzzle out how he got the job . " All 1 really am is a hunched-over guitar player. - Questions about The Nashville Sound seem to bore him . He shrugs and says it is not much more than a gimmicks , tag . " You can get the same sound with country records made in I lolly wood , " he says . " You can get it anywhere with these same musicians , boys from this part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the farm . The music they play has honesty . It has the same quality as Ray Charles . Soul . If you have it , it comes out in your music . That 's all it is . " A few years back Atkins was playing in an after-hours club in Nashville called the Carousel , and some say this was the origin of the sound . The band was made up of Atkins , Grady Martin and Hank Garland on guitars , Floyd Cramer on piano , Buddy Harman on drums and Bob Moore on upright bass . These are the musicians seen over and over again at the recording sessions . The tinkly , gospel-rock piano work of Cramer is one of the most disinctive things about the new sound , that and the smooth choral backing of the Anita Kerr Singers and the Jourdanaires . Nashville A-and-R men are not as much inclined to electronic trickery ( echo chambers , etc. ) as their rocker counterparts in Detroit and Hollywood , but in the current spirit of anything goes , they are moving in that direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if a sideman gets carried away and hits a crazy lick or makes a weird noise , it 's usually left in . A lot of the unidentifiable noises are produced by Pete Drake on his steel guitar . He can make it gronk like a tuba if gronks are called for , and he can make it sound like someone talking underwater if this need arises . Atkins , of course , is a soloist , but he occasionally does some personal overdubbing . That is , he will take a taped song and superimpose his own guitar runs on it to beef up the thin spots . Cramer and Drake are soloists too , but they are also among the busiest sidemen in town . The money is good , $61 for a three-hour session , double that for the leader , and they have no objection to playing nameless on someone else 's record . There are about 100 sidemen in Nashville who work with some regularity at the studios , says Musicians ' Local 237 , and about 35 of them make from $20,000 to $80,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also flounders a bit in trying to define the Sound . " I 've been asked what it is a thousand times and I 've given a thousand different answers . And I think I 've been right every time . " He peers over his glasses at a clock that tells him what time it is in Hollywood and New York and smokes a cigarette in a holder and carries on a long-distance phone conversation and a personal chat , all at once . " A few years ago we were forced to take a second look at some of these songs . They were better than we thought . This Sound business , all it boils down to is an approach . It 's the spontaneity of certain musicians here getting together and making up an arrangement on the spot . The A-and-R men are just some kind of referees . " Music Row , where the business is concentrated , runs for three or four parallel blocks on 16th and 17th avenues in a going-to-seed residential section about five minutes from downtown Nashville . A Nashville recording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangers , no producers and no written music , except once in a while a lead sheet , and the singer has probably brought that along for the words , not the music . Usually no one has rehearsed except the singer . At the start of the session he goes through the song once , or just plays a demo ( demonstration record ) for the sidemen . If the'Look at me , ' the executive says .. ' A-and-R man is an accomplished musician like Atkins , he may have some definite ideas about how it should be done . If not , he , the singer and the sidemen simply work it out as they go along , and stop when everybody is more or less pleased . They know one another well and they anticipate one another 's moves . Everybody is free to offer suggestions and there is a lot of fast infield chatter . " Hey , Pig . why do n't you do that twice ? " " Brighten it just a hair , Jerry . " " And right there , more ching-ching-thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , punch it up . " " You got any squirrels out at your place ? " " I ai n't seen a squirrel this year . Plenty of hicker nuts but no squirrels . " " Bear with me. chill on , I 'm ' on sing this lover if it takes all night . " There is not much written music to be seen in Nashville , except for what is embroidered on clothes . but pianists and bass players are frequently seen reading from scraps of paper on which series of numbers have been scribbled . The numbers are code  --  each of them represents the bass note of the chord in one bar of music . Some musicians are so deft at it that they can jot the note numbers down after listening to a demo once . " If we gave even the most mediocre written musical test , I doubt very much if half our members could pass it , " says George W. Cooper , president of Local 257 . " But that 's not to say they are n't good musicians . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . they read music all right , " Atkins'says . " But they read it with their ears instead of their eyes . " Atkins is an artist and he naturally takes his own guitar work seriously . The same goes for Bill Monroe . the father of bluegrass pi'cking. and his proteges , Flatt and Scruggs . For the most part though , to ask serious questions about country music  --  apart from what it 's doing in the charts  --  is to draw blank looks . The songs have been scorned and ridiculed so long by outsiders that the performers themselves have come to place little value on them . A good many of the singers , one gathers , would turn to pop music tomorrow morning if they could change their accents and get booked in Las Vegas . They yearn to see their records in the pop charts , where the money is . At the same time they must not seem to be wanting this ; they must be careful not to alienate their country fans , who are a jealous lot . The situation makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs the town 's largest publishing ishing house , Acuff-Rose , is known as a pas- sionate advocate of pure country music . " I 've been lighting this battle for years , " he says . " I tell my boys to keep their eyes off the pop market and concentrate on making good country songs . If they 're good enough they 'll make their way anywhere . " A few days later one finds Rose directing Roy Orbison , a rock-pop singer , in a recording session . Orbison was one of the rockers with Sun Records in Memphis in the 1950 's whodealt country music such a terrible blow . Or take Audrey Williams , who is the handsome platinum-blonde widow of Hank Williams , probably the most legendary figure country music has produced . Audrey Williams is something of a celebrity herself , having been the provocation for so many of Hank 's famous laments . She now directsan la , ' tai ion called Audrey Williams Enter-nov.1 , which involves a small movie company , a record label and the management of her singer-son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps in her garage the 1952 blue Cadillac convertible that Hank died in on New Year 's Day , 1933 . But when Sam Katzman made a movie based on Hank 's life ( Your Chealiu ' Heart ) . she agreed with the boys from the Coast that Hank 's twangy , countrified singing should not be used on the sound track , The much blander voice of Hank Jr .. then 15 , was used instead , along with new arrangements and instru ? mentation . Of course it was Flank , not Hank Jr. , who sold all those records , but Mrs. Williams does not see the point of the objection . " We thought it would reach more people this way , " she says . " A lot of people do n't like that old fiddle-and-steelguitar sound . I believe in progress . " Then there 's Buck Owens trte Got a Tiger by the Tail ) who has the Buck Owens Pledge to Country Music . It 's in scroll form , and free copies are available , suitable for framing . - 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " it goes , and " I shall make no record that is not a country record . " and so on . Fair enough , except that one of Buck 's latest releases , a big seller , is an instrumental called Buckaroo that you can do the Watusi to . It is probably foolish to , pursue this sort of thing , and it is certainly unrewarding  --  like trying to get a triangulation Ex on Roger Miller , the biggest thing out of Nashville since Hank Williams . " Oh yeah . we still think of Roger as a country singer , " says Buddy Killen . Miller 's publisher in Nashville . " No , no , Roger 's not a country singer , not anymore , " says Don Williams , Miller 's agent . " I do n't know just what I am , " says Miller , rehearsing for a television show in New York . " I like to entertain everybody . Scooby doo . " To many people the most interesting thing , the only interesting thing about the business is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys being in the chips , driving Cadillacs with six-shooter door handles and wearing outrageous , glittering Western suits , designed by Nudie of Hollywood . Country singers are growing weary of this image , if not weary enough to stop making money . " I guess you 're going to write another one of those articles about how we 're all a bunch of rich idiots , " said Faron Young , the Singing Sheriff . " Rhinestones on our clothes and all that . " " Well , a lot of you are idiots , Faron. remember that , " said Jan Crutchfield. an irreverent cleffer . The former movie lawman was not amused . " Not all of us , neighbor . Not by a long shot . " The big money is in personal performances  --  state fairs , coliseum shows , one-night stands in tank tob'ns . Young Johnny Cash grasses around $500,000 a year on personals alone . He . Roger Miller and Buck Owens are the superstars , and they get $2,500 and up for a single show . against a percentage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mart from West Plains , gets $1. - 100 and up for a show , and Ernest Tubb ( Via Walking the Floor Deer You ) gets upwards of $1,000 .

A lot of them also have to rush back from the man-wrecker road to ' fleet their ( ) pry commitments , or to tape their syndicated television shows , This is the new mark of prestige , the syndicated television show . Platt and Scruggs have one , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carl Smith has a network show on Canadian television , Porter Wagoner 's show , sponsored by a purgative called Black-Draught , is probably the most successful . It is shown in 80 " markets . " and claims an audience of 20 million people . This is about the same size as Jimmy Dean 's ABC network audience . For most country singers there is not much money in records . " Country records are like salt and pepper in the grocery store , " says Owen Bradley . " The turnover is not big but it 's steady . " This reassuring salt metaphor ( sometimes sour ) is often heard in Nashville . Eddy Arnold ( Bouquet of Roses ) . most durable of the country crooners , has had 56 top-10 records since 1948. which makes him far and away the leader over a period of years . He , Miller , Cash or Owens could make a handsome living on record sales alone , but not many could . In fact , a record can make the top live in the country charts and not sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 cents per record the company gross on a 15.000 seller would be $7.500 . Take at least $700 off the top for the cost of the recording session ( $850 if choral voices are used . 81.200 with strings ) and that leaves $6,800 . The singer would then get about four percent of that or a $272 check for his " hit . " And that 's all he 'd get . Jukebox operators . who buy most of the country singles , pay no royalties to anybody because of a curious interpretation of the copyright law , and radio stations pay no royalties to the " artist " or singer . The stations do . however . pay royalties to the publisher and composer . So almost every singer and picker in Nash-vine seems 1 ( 1 IM : D music " publisher " these days . The word actually is a inisis liner , a holdover from ( he ( lays when sheet music was a substantial sit I H the business . Acuff-Rose still prints sale c ' , . , f its songs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roger Miller 's songs , but few others print anything , If you went to a small " publisher " and tried to buy a sheet copy of something like You Broke Illy Hear ! , So Now I 'm Going to Break Your Jaw , the chances of getting it would he slim , unless you had a subpoena . T these days the " publisher " is really a talent scout and a copyright agent . He seeks out songs , copyrights them and peddles them , usually on demo tapes , to the singers and the record companies . For this service B.M.I. ( Broadcast Music , Inc. ) pays him four cents per radio play ( the composer gets 2.5 cents ) . The composer and publisher get a penny apiece for each record sold . At one time . in true folk tradition , just about every country singer wrote his own songs . Most of the classics are productions of the singer-writer : Jimmie Rodgers 's Blue Yodel series , Roy Acuff 's Great Speckled Bird , Jimmie Davis 's You Are Mr Sunshine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still very much around  --  Roger Miller sings only his own material  --  but in recent years there has been a proliferation of nonperforming writers , It is a precarious trade . Miller himself first made his reputation as a writer . ? The Opry never figured me for much of a singer , " he says . In 1958 he wrote a string of country hits such as Half a Mind ( Ernest Tubb ) , Imitation to the Blues Ray Price ) and Billy Bayou ( Jim Reeves ) . " I was a great big success ; the only thing was , I was n't making any money . " Writer Jan Crutch held explains about that kind of success : " 1 wrote one in 1961 with two other guys that was in the charts 26 weeks . It was called The Outsider . Bill Phillips cut it .

Nevertheless , with a few really big sellers and a small catalog of standards , a writer can retire young .

They wrote MEM On , Little Dreamer , which Perry Gann recorded and which shows signs of becoming a standard , and they have had a number of moderate successes . Crutchfield is if lull , thin , moustachioed country hipster who used to share a boardinghouse room with Roger Miller , Burch is an admirer of author Terry Southern , and he has an upper-middle-class , tousled , campusy air . He once planned to attend the New School for Social Research in New York , and is writing a novel about the Nashville scene . Together he and Crutchfield write rock songs , pop songs , uptown country and hard country . At taping sessions , Crutchfield does the singing  --  now he 's Fats Domino , now T.

" Other people have drifted in , bookers and secretaries , to listen and offer advice . " Do me a favor , Crutch , and pitch that one to Lefty Frizzell . . . Now that 's a George Morgan song if I ever heard one . Or Buck Owens . Buck 's would sell more , but I kinda like to hear George do it . ...

In the had old rockn ' - roll days , ( Ie opt y stood rii m when other hillbilly shows around I he South were giving way . The Opre came through it and the others only manage ; I Io lose both audiences , But this same conservatism led it to overlook Miller . The pay is bad on this show and the working conditions are primitive , but a country singer will do anything  --  lose money , drive a log truck up from Moultrie , Ga.  - -  to get on it . A few years ago a singer named Stonewall Jackson did that -- parked his log truck outside the WSM building , went in , sang a song and won a spot on the show . The Opry 's pay scale starts at 10 dollars , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more than $60 for a Saturday night 's performance . Many singers have a deep loyalty to the Opry . Roy Acuff , the King of Country Music ( Dizzy Dean gave him the title ) , has been a regular since 1938 . He certainly does n't need the billing or the money . and he could n't be dragged off the show . " I never thought the Opry needed me , " he says . " I need the Opry .
