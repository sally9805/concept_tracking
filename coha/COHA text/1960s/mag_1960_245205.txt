IN the worldwide trade-and-aid war , U.S. shortcomings and mistakes are well known , thoroughly publicized . But is the Russian economic-aid program to underdeveloped countries an overwhelming success ? Last week , as Soviet Premier Khrushchev granted $250 million in credits to Indonesia and rode through the streets of Kabul , Afghanistan , freshly paved from Soviet aid funds , the Russians ' score seemed high . In some cases it is-e.g. , Egypt 's Aswan Dam , Cuba 's sugar contract for 1,000,000 tons a year . But the overall Soviet-bloc record includes many a blunder . Even more important , by following the basic pattern of foreign aid laid down by the U.S. , the Russians have been forced to follow a path of frustration and bad Marxist economics . By sponsoring aid projects and raising the economic standards of underdeveloped nations , the Reds are working toward eliminating the discontent that fosters Red revolutions . In the long run , says the Library of Congress ' Russian Expert Leon Herman , the Reds are actually working toward the U.S. ideal that successful economic development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet-bloc projects are offered on a hit-or-miss basis , the Reds often make costly mistakes . Some examples : <P> In Indonesia , the East Germans finished a sugar mill two years behind schedule only to find that it was a beet-sugar mill and the rollers were not heavy enough to crush Indonesian cane sugar . <P> In Burma , a luxury hotel twelve miles outside Rangoon has become a white elephant because it has no air conditioning and is too far out of town for the Western travelers for whom it was designed . <P> In 1958 , the Russians dumped 18,000 tons of tin into a saturated world market , hoping to create price chaos . But Malaya , Bolivia and Indonesia , which depend heavily on tin exports , complained bitterly , forced the Reds to halt their dumping . <P> Pitched to a splashy one-shot approach , the Soviet bloc has often fallen far short on quality , failed to back its goods . When Indonesia bought 4,000 Russian jeeps as part of a $100 million credit , the landed cost of the vehicles was $4,000 each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( $2,500 ) . <P> The Red jeeps had windshield frames that buckled under the tropical heat , glass with ripples , and tires that wore out after 5,000 miles . Russian diesel motors sold in Argentina held up for fewer than three years . And when drilling machines ordered by a Brazilian firm from Poland arrived in bad condition the Poles ignored all claims . <P> Although the Russians insist that their aid is offered without any strings attached , they crack the whip whenever it suits their purpose , e.g. , " postponement " ' of credits to Yugoslavia after the split with Marshal Tito . Often the terms of Red aid packages are such that underdeveloped nations are shortchanged . The Russians tacked artificially high price tags ( in rubles ) onto the goods they bartered in return for Egyptian cotton . Then they resold the cotton to West Germany , Switzerland and other regular Egyptian customers , at a 10% discount . <P> Cuba faces a similar threat from inflated Red prices and dumping in its agreement to sell the Russians 1,000,000 tons of sugar a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Much of what we call Soviet aid is in fact deferred barter .
