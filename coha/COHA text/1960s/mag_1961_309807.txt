From the start of the ballot counting , the cocksure little Democrat led Incumbent Republican Norris Poulson in Los Angeles ' " nonpartisan " mayoralty election . But when Sam Yorty , 51 , hung on to win an upset 16,000-vote victory last week , there was precious little celebrating among California 's Democratic leaders . Indeed , most of them blanched in dismay - for in a state filled with dissident Democrats , Yorty is perhaps the most dissident of all . <P> <P> Open to Argument . Arriving in California at age 17 with $80 in his pocket , Nebraska-born Sam Yorty went to the University of Southern California and Southwestern University Law School , worked at jobs ranging from auto salesman to haberdasher , passed the California bar in 1936 , and that same year was elected to the California legislature . In his early political days , Yorty was a shocking-pink liberal , much in demand as a speaker for leftist causes . Since then-in the course of three terms in the state assembly and two in the U.S. House of Representatives-Yorty has changed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument . " All the reactionaries call me liberal and all the liberals call me reactionary . " says Yorty . " A real liberal is probably the most anti-Communist of anybody , and we 're the most hated by the Communists . " <P> In 1956 Yorty sought the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senator-and saw it go to State Senator Richard Richards , who was later defeated in the general election . Yorty broke completely with the <P> Democratic Party , began denouncing his fellow Democrats , and has been doing it ever since . Richard Richards , said Yorty. " not only has a double name , he is a master of double talk . " Democratic Governor Edmund G. ( " Pat " ) Brown is a favorite Yorty target : " Unless Brown intends to start conducting himself like a big-leaguer , he had better stay in the minor leagues . " In 1960 Yorty took out after Democratic Presidential Candidate John Kennedy : " He has destroyed the integrity of the Democratic Party by the abuse of the power of lavish amounts of money , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not take Kennedy . " In the campaign , Yorty backed Nixon . <P> Slugfest . Last April Yorty again sallied forth against the will of party leaders , surprised everyone by finishing close enough to Poulson in a nine-candidate election for mayor to force last week 's runoff . Opposed by leaders of both parties and by all four major Los Angeles dailies . Yorty fought his special kind of bare-knuckled campaign . He cried out against the " entrenched downtown interests , " vowed to fire the whole police commission if elected , and questioned darkly how Poulson could afford a cattle spread in Oregon worth , or so Yorty claimed , a cool $250,000 . <P> Famed in Los Angeles as the gladdest glad-hander of them all , Norris Poulson made the mistake of trying to slug it out with Yorty . He linked Yorty with Nevada gamblers , claimed his opponent had underworld support . Yorty sued for $3,300,000 for slander . Suffering from a severe case of laryngitis , Poulson also made the tactical error of appearing on television shows with the vigorous Yorty , left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . <P>
