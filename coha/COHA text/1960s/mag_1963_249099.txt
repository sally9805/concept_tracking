POMPADOUR by Jacques Levron. 279 pages . St Martin's. $6.95 . <P> <P> If the infamous mistresses of France 's famous Kings were fallen women , it was for years possible to envy them for having fallen in so lush a spot as the Palace of Versailles . Then historians began discovering that Versailles was a drafty place , where the public privies had no doors . Now along comes a <P> Frenchman named Jacques Levron with a revised portrait of Mme. de Pompadour , probably the richest and most celebrated courtesan of all time , as a woman harassed almost beyond human endurance by illness and intrigue . To hear Levron tell it , the poor girl might just as well have been married . <P> Grasshopper King . Life with Louis was just one damned thing after another . As the first member of the middle class ever to become an official mis tress to a French King , Pompadour was target for the gibes of high-born courtiers from the day she was installed in the palace in 1745 until the day she died there-after dutifully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At first her intellectual mentor , Voltaire , had to correct her in a whisper at state dinners because her middle-class turn of phrase was so foreign to the phony formulas of the court . Her surname ( Poisson , which means fish ) was an endless source of cruel merriment . <P> <P> Where women were concerned , Louis combined a grasshopper 's attention span with the appetite of a tiger . Pompadour , who suffered from tuberculosis , desperately sought to divert him to less athletic pursuits , like amateur theatricals , at which she was gifted , and small dinner parties where the king could " pour his own coffee " and see a few friends . It was a great relief when , as her adviser , the Abbe de Bernis , related with exquisite courtliness , the King 's " friendship took the place of gallantry . " But then Pompadour had to be doubly on guard against being driven from favor by more lusty ladies - among them a curvaceous Celt with the improbable name of Louise O'Murphy who " looked like a naughty Rubens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could remove her mask , " Levron writes , " she was , at thirty-seven , already an elderly , exhausted and haggard woman who spat blood . " <P> Loyalties of the Purse . Inevitably , much of Author Levron 's material is not new . Nancy Mitford nine years ago produced a lighthearted biography sympathizing with Pompadour 's difficulties and praising her good taste , which , since she was the major patroness of the arts in France , set the age 's style in painting and sculpture and architecture . <P> What sets Levron 's work apart is that he approaches Pompadour not merely as an apologist and admirer but as an archivist-he is curator of all the his toric papers at Versailles . Delving into little-known notebooks and letters , he supports his assessments of her character with elaborate documentation of her daily housekeeping and the worthy causes she supported .
