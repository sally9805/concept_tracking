Sir : Your article on the Republican presidential hopefuls Oct. 20 , occasioned by the state Governors ' trip aboard the S.S. Independence , reports an idea about Richard Nixon that I find to be as leaky as the Independence is seaworthy . This " ca n't win " idea just should n't be attached to a man who lost the California gubernatorial race in 1962 , when the Republican Party there was split between conservatives and liberals , and who came within a hair of winning the presidency in 1960 , when the G.O.P. in the South practically did n't exist . This is 1967 ; the Republican Party is nationally unified and is strong in the South . <P> ARTHUR CODY Ridgefield Park , NJ . <P> Sir : You mentioned the possibility of New York 's Mayor John Lindsay 's being nominated as the Republican vice-presidential candidate in 1968 . It seems inconceivable to me that the Republican Party would so honor a man who in his own campaign went to great lengths to shun the Republican label . While it is true that such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barry Goldwater in 1964 , these men disavowed a candidate , not the entire Republican Party . With so many other promising Republicans coming to the front of the political picture , the party will hardly be inclined to reward Mr. Lindsay 's past and present actions aimed at maintaining his independent image . <P> DIANE M. FERGUSON Norwalk , Conn . <P> Sir : The implication of your review of the Republican candidates was that the American voting public is more concerned with the looks and appeal of a candidate than his views and experience . I think you underestimate the seriousness of the issues confronting our nation and the mentality of the voter . <P> T. FREEMAN Morristown , NJ . <P> Sir : As usual , your pseudointellectual , leftist " enlightened Republicanism " has placed a misfit on top . Wishful thinking . That divorced , unhonorable protg of your ex-boss appeals only to the ignorant and uninformed Eastern Seaboard masses so easily led by TIME . Thinking Republicans are conservative and in opposition ; the way back to constitutional government requires that we place our faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material wealth swapped out for basic freedoms . Reagan is a clean top choice . Rockefeller as a vice-presidential candidate would be a necessary evil to carry votes of the misled . <P> HARRY M. GREEN Dallas <P> Drawing a Line <P> Sir : Senator Dirksen says that " our outer defense perimeter started in Korea and went to South Viet Nam " Oct. 13 . It would clear the air considerably if we heard a little less about freedom , justice , democracy , treaties , commitments and obligations in our public discussions , and a little more about defense perimeters . Then , for example , we who oppose the war in Viet Nam would not need to bother with moral points which do n't interest anybody , or produce pictures of napalmed children ; we could simply point out that our defense perimeter has no business being in Viet Nam . <P> Senator Dirksen is appalled by the notion that if our line in Viet Nam fails , it will be pushed back to Alaska and Hawaii . Now a line from Alaska to Hawaii strikes me as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line , and even , if you wish , a moral line .
