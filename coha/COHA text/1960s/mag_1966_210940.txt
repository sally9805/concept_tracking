" Senator , " said the forlorn constituent calling on Montana 's Mike Mans field at the majority leader 's Washington office , " I 've never been East before , never spoken to a Congressman , and ca n't afford this trip . So you can appreciate that I 've got a serious complaint . " <P> The complaint that he and about 530 other home builders from around the U.S. brought before their Congressmen last week in a one-day lobbying visit was simple : their industry is in a perilous condition . Competition for deposits between commercial banks , which lend primarily to business , and savings institutions , which lend mortgage money , has grown so fierce that the supply of mortgage funds is dwindling and higher interest rates are scaring away home buyers . <P> For any Congressman who doubted it , the home builders could offer a store house of statistics . The Federal Home Loan Bank Board reported that new-home mortgage rates climbed in June for the sixth straight month . The average U.S. rate on new homes is now 6.07% ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6.55% in San Francisco and 6.6% in Atlanta . June housing starts were down 18% from a year ago . Building permits , which give an indication of what is to come , are down 25% . F. W. Dodge Co. , surveying six-month activity in the construction industry , re ported that while total building is up 8% over the first six months of 1965 , residential building has dropped 1 % be cause of " the mortgage gap . " This year , predicted Dodge , 1,425,000 private , nonfarm homes will be built , a drop of 100,000 from earlier estimates . <P> Circulating through Capitol corridors last week , home builders talked of their troubles in local terms . Calling on Senators Thruston Morton and John Sherman Cooper , a delegation of 40 Kentuckians reported that single-family building permits were off by 36% in Louisville so far this year . Pittsburgh Builder Roland Catarinella called the low-income housing market back home " 100% dead , " said he had canceled construction of a 100-apartment project . William Harvey of Bettendorf , Iowa , said he had lopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was just about covering overhead . " When it becomes more than I can afford , " he said bitterly , " I 'm going to say the hell with it for two or three years . " <P> With elections coming in the fall , no Congressman was indifferent to such complaints . Neither was President Johnson , who received a delegation led by National Association of Home Builders President Larry Blackmon , a fellow Texan . And along with soothing promises , some action was under way . <P> Congressman Wright Patman 's House Banking Committee approved a bill that , among other things , allows the Federal Reserve flexibility to 1 ) set varying rate ceilings on different classes and amounts of time deposits ; 2 ) raise bank reserve requirements against time deposits ; and 3 ) pump money into the mortgage market by purchasing the obligations of the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Home Loan Banks . The Senate did as well : a subcommittee headed by Alabama 's John Sparkman voted to give the FNMA , familiarly known as Fannie Mae , $2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
