One of Charles de Gaulle 's favorite maxims is that " power does not retreat " - by which he means that his government does not hesitate to take tough decisions . But last week , enmeshed in a showdown struggle with Antoine Pinay , the economic miracle worker of France 's Fifth Republic , De Gaulle hesitated before the eyes of the whole world . Twice Pinay was summoned into conference with Premier Michel Debr , twice into discussions with President de Gaulle himself . At last , after a flurry of ambiguous communiques , came the laconic announcement that despite De Gaulle 's " appreciation " of Pinay 's successful economic policies , Pinay was through as Finance Minister . To replace him De Gaulle named Wilfrid Baumgartner , 57 , longtime governor of the Bank of France . <P> To waiting newsmen , peppery , popular little Antoine Pinay gave his own blunt version of his ouster . Torn between awareness of the public confidence that Pinay inspires and impatience with Pinay 's questioning of De Gaulle 's loyalty to the Western alliance , De Gaulle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the job of minister in charge of " longterm national policy . " Snorted Pinay : " They wanted me to supervise our future but keep hands off the present . . . In the end they heaped me with flowers and chucked me out . " <P> Too Many Saviors . Pinay 's ouster , as both he and De Gaulle clearly realized , marked the beginning rather than the end of a battle . Insisting that he was leaving " without bitterness . " Pinay said he was temporarily withdrawing from politics-but in a phrase deliberately reminiscent of De Gaulle 's self-imposed political retirement in 1946 , Pinay proclaimed that he would " always remain at the disposition of the French people . " <P> " God help our country , " cracked one cynical Parisian . " Now we have two saviors . " Obviously , Pinay was aware that De Gaulle 's term as President has six more years to run . But by forcing a break , and by posing it as a question of preserving France 's monetary and economic stability , Pinay was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition to De Gaulle . One of the four remaining Independents in the Cabinet , Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Max Flchet , resigned later in the week . <P> No More Games . By naming Wilfrid Baumgartner to Pinay 's old job , De Gaulle adroitly sought to reassure France 's business community that the Fifth Republic was not about to plunge into economic statism . Member of a famed French Protestant family , Baumgartner won the coveted title of inspecteur des finances at 27 , has long been known as a " sound-money " man . He said that he had " formal assurances " that he could continue the policies " now underway . " <P> But he is also a lifelong economic technician without political experience , who took the job " without joy , " is less likely to stir up Cabinet debates than Pinay . His appointment was a clear sign of the way the De Gaulle government is trending . Fired up once again with his old contempt for " political games , " De Gaulle was steadily cleansing his government of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are able-but technicians .
