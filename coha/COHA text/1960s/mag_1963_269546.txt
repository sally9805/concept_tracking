The American Bank Note Co. is a staid old institution that makes money by making money . The oldest and richest of the three U.S. firms that still print bank notes , it is a sort of job-lot treasurer that churns out paper money for 55 nations around the world , including Colombia , Ecuador , Brazil , Mexico , Egypt and Guatemala . From its presses last year 25 million stock certificates and 7.5 million bonds , all the travelers ' checks for American Express and four other firms , corporate checks for more than 2,000 of the nation 's largest firms , and postage stamps for 65 nations . <P> Bank Note is kept busy these days filling orders for money from young nations and performing rush jobs for some old nations ravaged by inflation . Last week its printing plant in New York City 's Bronx was busy printing a rush order of 5,000-cruzeiro notes ( present value : $1 ) for inflation-ridden Brazil . " We really prefer a well customer to a sick one , " says Chairman and President W. Frederic Colclough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( three U.S. , one Canadian , one British ) , from a colonnaded granite building near Wall St. But , naturally , since inflation starts the printing presses rolling , he concedes : " We have mixed feelings . " Well they might : last year Bank Note 's sales hit a record $26.4 million and profits a new high of $1,900,000 . <P> Body Blows . Although it took its present corporate form in 1911 , Bank Note likes to trace its history back through 50-odd companies to a colonial engraver named Robert Scot . Until the Federal Bureau of Engraving and Printing opened in 1862. the company printed virtually all U.S. currency . A changing world usually means good times for Bank Note , but change has also dealt the company some severe blows . It lost its biggest customer for paper money when China went Communist in 1949 , lost another big customer two years ago when Cuba 's Castro switched to Czech-printed money . Bank Note does not think much of Cuba 's new currency . " It 's not secure , not secure at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once declared , " the greatest asset of this company is its mystery . " Bank Note has always been extraordinarily concerned with security , keeps its premises closely guarded . With half of its business now in printing securities for such corporate giants as A.T . &; T. , General Motors . Du Pont and General Electric , it often knows months in advance that a company is planning a stock split or a new bond issue-information Wall Street speculators would love to have . And to foil counterfeiters , it uses special paper embedded with colored disks , mixes its own inks , and even makes its own special presses . Every item is counted and recorded 33 times from raw paper to finished product , and rejects are cremated in blazing furnaces .
