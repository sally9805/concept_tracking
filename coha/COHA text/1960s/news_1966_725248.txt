txt The thrust , the priorities of the upcoming Congress are beginning to emerge , even before the President speaks . There probably wo n't be an increase in taxes . There chill be trimming and realign. ment of expenditures in response to bigger spending commitments in Vietnam . The first big item on the agenda will be resumption of the struggle over the repeal of Section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act . And there is n't much likelihood of new civil-rights legislation . The author of this information is Majority Leader Mike Mansfield . He had been talking to the President , and , not too long after , called an impromptu meeting with the press in " his office . The Montana Senator greeted the small group of reporters warmly and said . " I do n't have much to say . " Then , in his quiet way , he went on to say quite a lot .

" Would legislation passed in the last session actually be repaired ? The Senator answered : " This has to be done by the chairmen of the committees . I made the suggestion , and I hope they carry through with the suggestion . " On Senate leadership , the Senator said he saw no changes . This would mean that Sen. Russell B. Long of Louisiana will continue in his Whip post after succeeding to the chairmanship of the powerful Finance Committee .                   @ @
