KO , OR A SEASON ON EARTH ( 115 pp. ) - Kenneth Koch-Grove ( clothbound $3.50 ; paperback $1.45 ) . <P> <P> Unlike long novels , long poems are firmly out of fashion , and in some ways the fact is regrettable . There is an exhilaration , a knowledge of manliness gained by the reader who establishes his base camps on , say , Milton 's Paradise Lost , climbs from couloir to crag , and at last reaches the summit . Now Poet Kenneth Koch , an instructor in humanities at Columbia College , has defied the trend by writing a 115-page comic poem , a kind of lesser Catskill among epics , which offers a not very strenuous practice climb with hot-dog stands every hundred yards . <P> Corner on the Pooch Market . The main themes of Ko are , as its dust jacket states , " baseball , neurosis , art and death ; travel , weather , self-realization and power ; love , error , prophesy , destruction and pleasure . " Among the characters who reel through the commotion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Byron 's Don Juan ) are Ko , a young Japanese pitcher who earns a tryout with the Dodgers and throws with such force that he shatters grandstands : Dog Boss , a financier who has cornered the pooch market ; Amaranth , the king of England ; a nameless but enchanted fish ; and Huddel , a cockney . The cast might have come from the nightmare of a blintz-tormented sorcerer , and its actions provide no political , religious or metaphysical insights . <P> Although Koch worked on the poem eight hours a day for four months ( in Italy , " on my wife 's Fulbright " ) , he is really just having fun . And he is always perfectly willing to let a chance rhyme divert his attention . While " snow From the high Himalayas comes unstuck , " he writes . " Let 's pause a moment , like a dairy truck . " The next several stanzas , goofily irrelevant , are about a milkman . <P> Almanacs to Teach . Now and then Koch owes a nod to Ogden Nash ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As in Atlantic City Miss America " ) , but just as often he writes a line that is patently new and pleasant . When all the girls in Kansas take off their clothes ( there may be a metaphysical insight here , after all ) Koch observes that their bodies are " almanacs to teach . . . the poet how to shape his lines . The woodsman what is lacking in the pines . " All manner of things happen to the author 's creatures ; Ko pitches a perfect game , King Amaranth decides that England 's girls should undrape too , and several characters turn into statues . Analyzing these events is no more profitable than dissecting a soap bubble , or trying to explain a minor character named Higby , who " wears a wig be-/Cause he has no hair at all beneath/The wig he wears because he has no hair . " The reader recognizes Koch 's Ko as good comedy , <P> Just as when entering the Plaza de Toros <P> One knows which side is sol , or as a cat Knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boris , <P> The tenor sings ' Marina ! ' you know who Marina is : the one he 's singing to .
