In South Viet Nam , U.S. General Curtis LeMay , Air Force Chief of Staff , critically examined the Vietnamese air arm and found it good . Just before hopping into the pilot 's seat to fly his jet KC-135 to the Philippines , LeMay said : " It 's perfectly apparent to me that the Vietnamese government is making rapid strides in its efforts to clear the country of Communist insurgents . " Other recent visitors to South Viet Nam were not so sure . <P> Victory Key . Back in Washington from a month of firsthand observation in the jungle were four sunburned , weary U.S. officers-a general and three colonels . To President Kennedy , the four antiguerrilla specialists reported that the war with the Viet Cong guerrillas is going better , but that the Communists are still winning . Some of the report 's main points : <P> The peasants remain more friendly to the Viet Cong than to the pro-Western government of President Ngo Dinh Diem , and the peasants are the key to victory . <P> Corrupt local officials are putting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is spirited away and sold by local chieftains ; other aid vanishes in transit to the provinces . <P> Communications have improved but are still lagging , making it difficult to spread Saigon 's anti-Communist message . <P> What worked in Malaya-resettling peasants in " fortified villages " so that the guerrillas are cut off from peasant support-is not yet working in South Viet Nam . The peasants are passionately attached to their ancestral fields ; when they are moved , they usually slip off into the jungle to join the Reds , who promise to give them back their land . In two fortified villages , part of " Operation Sunrise , " where U.S. aid has supplied food , tools , houses and medical care , the peasants have discovered that life can be better than before . Elsewhere , they have simply been rounded up by uncomprehending district chiefs and put to work without pay . They listen sympathetically when the Viet Cong describe the fortified villages as " concentration camps . " <P> What worries many U.S. observers is the divide-and-rule philosophy of President Diem , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fortified-villages operation , for instance , is split between two ministerial committees , one headed by Diem 's powerful brother , Ngo Dinh Nhu , the other by one of Diem 's secretaries of state ; there is no liaison between the committees and very little within them-six or seven separate plans for rural reconstruction have been drawn up , and none are really working . Moreover , U.S. advisers complain that units of the South Vietnamese army can hardly make a move without first clearing it with Saigon , wasting priceless time in striking back at the guerrillas . <P> High Price . Washington has moved to remedy in part the lack of communications in the Vietnamese villages . Twentythree villages are already equipped with mimeograph machines , enabling trained Vietnamese editors to produce daily news papers with stories supplied by short wave radio . More than 100 mobile film units tour the country showing short subjects ranging from how-to-do-it films on health and agriculture to hard-hitting ex poses on the Viet Cong . The U.S. State Department , which helps with the scenarios , estimates that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
