Each of the new buildings is 750 feet long and 940 feet wide . Each has a generous double story with a basement and sub-basement area . Raised Car Ramps Raised automobile ramps will permit departing passengers to drive to the second level , where they will walk from their cars to ticketing , check-in , and baggage checking desks .
