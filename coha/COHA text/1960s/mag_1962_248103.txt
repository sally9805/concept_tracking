When he reads reports of such television advances as ultra high frequency and improved color telecasts , the average U.S. householder is less likely to glow with enthusiasm than he is to blanch at the prospect of buying a costlier new set . Not so in Britain , where more and more fans now rent their TV sets . Of the 12 million television sets operating in Britain , half are rented . Of new sets installed , 80% are now rented , compared with 10% a dozen years ago . <P> A Matter of Equity . The British believe that rented television has notable advantages , even for those who could well afford to buy . Rental companies carry a wide variety of sets ( one firm offers a choice of 32 new models at rentals ranging from $4.20 to $8.40 a month and 17 used models at even lower rates ) . The monthly rent that a " subscriber " pays is reduced every six months for the first few years that he continues to keep a set , and discounts are given for advance payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faulty sets repaired or replaced at no charge . The larger rental companies maintain mobile repair vans with parts , test benches and generators ; one firm handles 30,000 service calls a week . Says a satisfied London renter : " By the time you 've finished buying a set on hire-purchase , * it is n't worth anything anyway . You have no equity . What 's the sense of it ? " <P> With so many Englishmen eager to rent , more than a hundred companies have gone into television rentals . But because sets turn no profit until they have been rented for at least a year , large capital is required and 90% of the business is handled by six big firms . Largest of all is the pioneer in the field , Radio Rentals Ltd . Founded 32 years ago by Chairman Percy Perring-Thoms as a one-shop operation renting radios for 35 a week , Radio Rentals expanded into television just before World War II . Today the company has 750,000 subscribers and 310 sales offices , manufactures all its own rental sets through a subsidiary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $4,612,000 , Radio Rentals is about to become even bigger by absorbing ( for $4,200,000 ) E. D. Dawes Co. , a smaller rental company with 60 outlets in the north of England . <P> Reverse Flow . Because British business has borrowed so many sales techniques from the U.S. , most Britons take it for granted that TV rentals are also widespread in this country . " You mean you do n't have it in America ? " said one astonished Englishwoman . " I assumed we 'd got it from you . " In fact , out of 56 million U.S. TV sets , scarcely 500,000 are rented , and these are mostly in hotels and motels . But the idea is budding : Hertz started renting home sets in New York last December , reports triple the volume that it originally anticipated . <P> <P> * British for the installment plan .
