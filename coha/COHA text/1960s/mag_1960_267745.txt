" I 've got a dream parish , " says Father Clement H. Kern . " I 'm so lucky . Almost every seminarian hopes to get a church like this , but there are n't very many of them left . " <P> Father Kern 's dream parish , the Roman Catholic Most Holy Trinity Church , is located in a rundown , ramshackle Detroit slum , where sagging frame houses , tarpaper shacks and old brick duplexes are slowly giving way to warehouses and trucking garages . This is Corktown , once as Irish as its name , and the big white church , which has been in its present location since 1855 , still sports a trim of faded Kelly green . But the Irish have moved on and up in the world ; Corktown is now made up primarily of Mexicans , Negroes fresh from the South , Puerto Ricans and Maltese . <P> In the world of fund-raising organizations and church administrators , the conception of the parish church as the beating heart of a community is growing steadily rarer . But Holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserved by poverty . " We 're an island in the affluent society , " says Father Kern . " Most people just do n't believe there are poor any more . But there are plenty of them . We painted the church and parish house bright white for a reason . The incoming people hear that there 's a big white place where they can get help . There is no organization these days like a parish . It 's the human way of doing things . These people are afraid of the big agencies . They wo n't go to the clinics . But they will come to the church for medical help . ' ' <P> Vitamins for 150 . Holy Trinity is a parish of 5,000 souls , but actually ministers to thousands more , at least half of whom are non-Catholic . For almost all of them , the old church is the kind of hearth and headquarters it once was for the immigrant Irish . If pastors in the suburbs have trouble reaching their parishioners , Father Kern and his assistant priests do not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the commonest phrase he hears is " Tengo una molestia " ( I 've got trouble ) . <P> Unmarried mothers , sneak thieves , streetwalkers and undernourished children are all part of the day 's trouble at Trinity . Alcoholics are everywhere-even on the church staff . Joe O'Brien , the doorman , is a retired bartender who knows what it is to lose a weekend in the bottom of a glass . So do Charley Hirst , 51 , Father Kern 's secretary , and onetime Engineer John McCarthy , who runs the employment agency . Father Kern is an expert at straightening out " whisky priests . " <P> Every Thursday night , as many as 150 alcoholics-on-the-mend line up for their shots of vitamin B12 . The nerve-soothing vitamins are paid for partly by the Corktown Guild , whose members are mostly bartenders , and partly by the Corktown Coop , made up of men trying to rehabilitate themselves , who scavenge scrap to raise the money for their injections.                 @ @ @ @
