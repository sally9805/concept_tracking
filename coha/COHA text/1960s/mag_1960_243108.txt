The self-styled protector of small stockholders at corporate meetings is Xanthippe-tongued Wilma Porter Soss , fiftyish , who once showed up at a U.S. Steel meeting in a 1901 puffed-sleeve dress and ostrich-plumed hat appropriate , she said , for a management " 50 years behind in its stockholder relations . " With little stock ( e.g. , ten shares of U.S. Steel worth $831.25 ) but big ideas and a thirst for publicity , she has for a decade harassed U.S. Steel and other corporations , with small success . <P> Last week U.S. Steel was forced to go along with a pet Soss project . On proxy ballots mailed out for the annual meeting May 2 , management included a Soss proposal that stockholders be permitted to vote on whether they want a secret ballot in proxy voting , the first such proposal in corporate history . She contends that so much corporate stock is held by employees that they need the protection of a secret ballot to vote against management proposals . When Mrs. Soss first petitioned the corporation for her proposal , it refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , without ruling on the merit of the proposal , told the corporation to put it on the ballot . <P> Also on the ballot are U.S. Steel 's objections : under present rules , any stockholder can remain anonymous by registering his stock in the name of a bank or broker ; secret balloting would seriously restrict recounts and court challenges of close proxy battles ; the practical details for working out the system are immense .
