Except for hotels , hospitals and the Ku Klux Klan , almost no one these days gives much of a hoot for white sheets . Once the standard way to dress a bed , they are now hauled out only in an emergency ( when nothing else is clean or an unexpected guest arrives ) , today account for less than 45% of home sales . More and more , the going way to go to bed is in checks and plaids , scallops , scrollwork , and fields upon blooming fields of flowers . And for the linen closet that has everything , Fieldcrest last week rounded out the collection . The newest way to turn in with style : stars and stripes . <P> Now no one , but no one , sleeps on the American flag and lives to tell about it . But Fieldcrest insists " Three Cheers " is merely " a salute to colorful living , " with any associations flagwise purely coincidental and absolutely not intended . The colors are red , white and blue , all right , but Betsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important , the stars and stripes never appear together at the same time on the same sheet , pillowcase or reversible bath towel ( stars or stripes , never both , border the sheets , mix or match with towels and pillowcases in overall prints of either pattern ) . As a final disclaimer , the sheet and pillowcase stripes are slanted . Price : $3.99 a single sheet , $1.39 a pillowcase , $2.99 a towel .
