THE FUTURE OF GERMANY by Karl Jaspers. 173 pages . University of Chicago Press . $4.95 . <P> Philosopher Karl Jaspers , 85 , is a ghost at the German banquet who knows just how to haunt complacent fellow countrymen . Ever since the end of World War II , he has been relentlessly reminding his people that guilt belongs not only to Hitler but to the Germans who supported and obeyed him . Six years ago , he brought down Wagnerian thunder on his head by advising Germans to give up their favorite dream , reunification . Now in this slim , blunt : volume-a bestseller in Germany-he has put all the unpleasant reminders together . The result is a remarkable attempt at national selfcriticism . Only Gnter Grass-described by Jaspers as " our one political writer who can not be praised highly enough " - has stabbed harder at the German conscience . <P> Jaspers sees Germany today as morally adrift in prosperity , pretty much as it was morally adrift in poverty in 1931 , when he warned of the approaching collapse of the Weimar Republic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foresee a neo-Nazi takeover ? Hardly . But he does assert that the Germans are still making the same kind of peculiarly German mistake : looking for a system so perfect that the individual citizen will be spared the effort of trying to be good . <P> Passion for Order . In their " immoderate desire for security , " Jaspers finds Germans as overresponsive as ever to instant recipes for political salvation . They continue to put too much trust in the wrong things : the rationalism of know-how , the promise of perfection through the conquest of technology . Above all , " with built-in subject mentality , " he says , the Germans trust their government just because it is their government . They uncritically share its passion for order while it gives low priority to civil rights and tirelessly promotes laws to cover every possible emergency . They can not bring themselves to the heresy of doubting the self-sufficiency of method and apparatus . <P> The consequence , as Jaspers sees it , is that West Germany has become a kind of robot state without a heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roots nor an ideal in politics , no sense of where we come from or where we are going . . . Neither in the operations of our business nor in our passing , swiftly forgotten excitements is there a faith or an ethos . " But Jaspers does not leave matters with this harsh judgment . He is more than a gadfly .
