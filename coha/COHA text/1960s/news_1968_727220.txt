txt Another Opinion To Rehabilitate Galileo The following are excerpts from a speech entitled " Religion and Natural Sciences " by Franz Cardinal Konig of Vienna at a meeting of Nobel Prize winners in Germany last week . Neither the Christian churches nor modern science have managed to date to-control that component of human nature which mirrors visibly a like phenomenon in the animal kingdom : aggressiveness . I hold that the neutralization of this instinct , which now is creating more dangers than ever before , ought to be a prime goal of objective cooperation between theologians and scientists . This work should try to bridge the incongruity between man 's complete and perfected power of destruction and his psychic condition which remains unbridled and prey to atavism . Removing Barriers To enable such cooperation it is first of all necessary to remove the barriers of the past . Perhaps the biggest obstacle , blocking for centuries cooperation between religion and science , was the trial of Galileo . For the church after the second Vatican Council , turning as it is to the world as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , the time appears to have come to terminate as thoroughly as possible the era of unpleasantness and distrust which began with Galileo 's censure in 1633 . For over 300 years the scientific world has rightly regarded as a painful , unhealing wound the church 's unjust verdict on one of those men who prepared the path for modern science . Galileo 's judgment is felt all the more painful today since all intelligent people inside and outside the church have come to the conclusion that the scientist Galileo was right and that his work particularly , gave modern mechanics and physics a first , firm basis . His insights enabled the human mind to develop a new understanding of nature and universe , thus replacing concepts and notions inherited from antiquity . An open and honest clarification of the Galileo case appears all the more necessary today if the church 's claim to speak for truth , justice and freedom is not to suffer in credibility and if those people arc not to lose faith in the church who in past and present have defended freedom and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the so-called raison d'etat . I am in a position to announce before this meeting that competent authorities have already initiated steps to bring the Galileo case a clear and open solution . The Catholic Church is undoubtedly ready today to subject the judgment in the Galileo trial to a revision . Clarification of the questions which at Galileo 's time were still clouded allow the church today to resume the case with full confidence in itself and without prejudice . Faithful minds have struggled for truth under pain and gradually found the right way through experience and discussions conducted with passion . The church has learned to treat science with frankness and respect . It now knows that harmony is possible between modern man 's scientific thinking and religion . The seeming contradiction between the Copernican system or , more precisely , the initial mechanics of modern physics and the Biblical story of creation has gradually disappeared . Theology now differentiates more sharply between essentially divine revelations , philosophical constructions and spontaneously naive views of reality . What used to be insurmountable obstacles for Galileo 's contemporaries have stopped long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective Galileo no longer appears as a mere founder of a new science but also as a prominent proponent of religious thinking . In this field , too , Galileo was in many respects a model pioneer . Trial and Error In Galileo 's wake and in the spirit of his endeavors the Catholic church has through trial and error come to recognize the possibility of harmonious cooperation between free research and free thinking on the one hand and absolute loyalty to God 's word on the other . Today 's task is to draw the consequences from this recognition . Without fixing borders , God has opened his creation  --  the universe ? to man 's inquiring mind . The church has no reason whatsoever to shun a revision of the disputed Galileo verdict . To the contrary , the case provides the church with an opportunity to explain its claim to infallibility in its realm and to define its limits . However , it will also be a chance to prove that the church values justice higher than prestige .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
