txt New York gave President de Gaulle of France a great welcome yesterday . More than 1,000,000 persons  --  most of them along the route of the traditional parade up lower Broadway ? turned out in his honor . Without compromising his air of reserve , the towering , 69-year-old visitor seemed to be enjoying himself thoroughly . He described his reception as " vraiment magnifique . " All the way from Bowling Green to City Hall , General de Gaulle stood in an open car . He worked his arms from side to side , like a man communicating in semaphore . His smile was subtle  --  never broad , but bestowed with quick recurrence . Outside the Astor Hotel , where he was the city 's guest at lunch , he greeted several bystanders across police barricades . Brings Up Algeria Issue At the luncheon , with great deliberateness , and again at a formal dinner at the WaldorfAstoria last night , President de Gaulle injected the Algerian issue . He had not said a word in public about Algeria during his four days in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sad and useless " conflict was continuing in North Africa . At the dinner , he said France was eager for the drama there to play itself out . On both occasions , he emphasized that only by means of self-determination and free choice would France permit the future of Algeria to be determined . With former President Hoover at his right and Mayor // GREETING PLEASES FRENCH PRESIDENT He Says It Is Magnifique ' ? Reaffirms His Algeria Pledge at City Lunch // Wagner at his left , General de Gaulle asserted at the luncheon that the people of Algeria and no one else would decide the country 's course . Last night , shortly after Governor Rockefeller had concluded a toast to the General in French , the latter repeated , somewhat less pointedly , what he had said about Algeria at the luncheon . He said France was pledged to the policy of self-determination and free choice , throughout the Community , which includes African states and territories associated with France . In connection with Algeria , he declared firmly , " Nothing will deflect her from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of self-determination for Algeria was first made by President de Gaulle last Sept. 16 . Three choices were offered : independence , integration with France , or a form of Federal autonomy , retaining close ties to France . Statement Well Prepared The President 's assertion yesterday was taken not so much as a repetition of this offer as a reminder to the Algerian rebel leaders that he is determined not to deal with them politically . Shortly before the de Gaulle party left Washington early yesterday , it became known that the President intended to mention Algeria at the New York luncheon . French spokesmen said he had been prepared to answer questions on Algeria at the National Press Club news conference Monday . It was confirmed that questions on Algeria had been submitted . But for one reason or another , the press club chairman , Ed Edstrom , failed to reach them in the course of the nationally televised program . Although he spoke without notes at the luncheon , it was plain that , as usual , the General knew exactly what he planned to say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bore no relation to the remarks of the previous speakers , Mayor Wagner and Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge . Welcome Ceremonies Brief General de Gaulle 's day in New York began with his arrival from Washington at the marine terminal of La Guardia Airport shortly before 11 A. M. In very brief ceremonies , he assured Mayor Wagner that he intended to " dive into " the stimulating ocean of the metropolis , which he remembered fondly from visits in 1944 and 1945 . The initial welcome was over so quickly that it was decided to make a fifteen-minute stop at the Waldorf-Astoria before proceeding to Bowling Green , as originally planned . After the General had officially " moved in " to the thirtyfifth floor of the Waldorf Tow-1 ers. the motorcade reformed and moved down the East River Drive , where spouting fireboats citizen of New York in 1945 , hailed its approach to the tip presented the city 's medal of of Manhattan . honor and an accompanying As the parade formed , President de Gaulle was prevented by the bulk of the Custom House from having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift of his homeland to the United States . Later , the General alluded to the statue in his luncheon speech . What he did see from Bowling Green was the sweep of tall buildings on both sides , streaked and flaked by the cascade of paper . He saw French and American flags , and people standing ten to twelve deep at the curbs . At Wall Street , swirling masses of paper tape had enveloped the newly-budded maples of old Trinity Churchyard . The bells of the church did as well as they could with " La Marseillaise . " A man held aloft a crude Cross of Lorraine  --  and the applause was punctuated with cries of " Vive de Gaulle "  --  and " Hi-ya , Charlie . " Gestures With Both Arms Occasionally the General braced himself as he stood by holding the partition behind the front seat with his left hand . But for the greatest part of the ride , he gestured actively with both arms . At City Hall , the General and Mme. Gaulle signed the city 's guest book . Patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures as were asked , reviewed an honor guard and received a twenty-one gun salute . The motorcade then went uptown via the West Side Highway . The President 's car stopped at the north side of Forty-fourth Street outside the Astor Hotel . When he got out he crossed to the south side , shook several hands and murmured in . English , " Good luck to all of you . " At the luncheon , attended by more than 1,500 persons , the General responded to Mayor Wagner 's toast by rising , raising his glass and saying , " A la sant ? du President des EtatsUnis . " Ambassador Lodge , describing himself as a " member of President Eisenhower 's Cabinet , " hailed General de Gaulle as the Chief of State of a " great and friendly power  --  one which is eternal and which is indispensable to the world "  --  and as a man " whose courage shows human nature at its finest . " " It is not in vain , " General de Gaulle said , " that this city delegates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea * ? * I salute New York because it manages to combine , harmoniously and in freedom , numerous communities , so diverse in race and origin , whose common hallmark is cooperation in the pursuit of the great tasks of humanity . " From the Astor  --  its front covered with a mock fa ? ade of the Paris Opera , in connection with last night 's April in Paris ball  --  the party returned to the Waldorf-Astoria . During the afternoon General de Gaulle received individually Governor Rockefeller , former Gov . W. Averell Harriman , Dag Hammarskjold , Secretary General of the United Nations , and Adlai E. Stevenson . Governor Rockefeller said that American politics were not discussed ; " The General is a very discreet man , " he added . Mr. Harriman also said there had been no discussion of United States politics in his talk with President de Gaulle . Mr. Stevenson said that in his conversation with the President " I expressed pleasure with what he said about Algeria to- , day . " Receptions Picketed Later the French President attended receptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Seventh Regiment Armory , Sixty-seventh Street and Park Avenue . In both instances , there were small picketing demonstrations . Groups identifying themselves as sympathizers with the Algerian rebels chanted " Freedom , freedom , freedom , " or " Freedom for Africa , " across Fifth Avenue from the consulate and across Park Avenue from the Armory . Last night 's dress dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria was sponsored by seven organizations with strong ties to France . After Governor Rockefeller had remarked in his toast that " the West has never seemed more in need of purpose and greatness , " President de Gaulle toasted President Eisenhower ? in English . William A. M. Burden , United States Ambassador to Belgium , who presided , read a message from President Eisenhower . The years of comradeship and personal friendship , his feelings toward President de Gaulle could be summed up by two short phrases that he was sure would be shouted often in the future : " Viva de Gaulle ! " and " Vive la France ! " In his response , the French President spoke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which , he said to a burst of applause , was the " true France .
