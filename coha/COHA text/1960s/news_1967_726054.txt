txt The 90th Congress opened today , and a coalition of Republicans and Southern Democrats immediately took charge in the House of Representatives . It was a Republican resolution backed by Southerners that blocked the seating of Representative Adam Clayton Powell pending an investigation of his conduct . The two forces teamed up again later in the day to defeat ' the so-called 21-day rule , used in the past to prevent the Rules Committee from holding up Administration bills . Tonight the House and Senate met in joint session to hear President Johnson deliver his State of the Union Message . " What happened today , " Representative Emanuel Celler , Democrat of Brooklyn , said of the House actions , " is a forerunner of what you can expect in this Congress . The Republicans and Dixiecrats are going to kill all liberal legislation . They will be utterly reactionary . " Representative Carl Albert of Oklahoma , the Democratic leader , looked pale and shaken . " I 've had a hard clay " was all // Coalition of Republicans and Southern Democrats Takes House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BILLS Administration Forces Are Beaten  --  Celler Foresees ' Reactionary ' Congress // he would say after seeing the Administration forces ? so firmly in control in the 59th Congress  --  beaten by the coalition . The 21-day rule is no longer ' considered vital in assuring the ' flow of Administration legisla-1 tion to the House floor for a I vote . Before making Represen- , tative William M. Colmer , Democrat of Mississippi , chairman of the Rules Committee in this Congress , Democratic leaders extracted from him a promise to hold regular committee meetings . Mr. Colmer 's predecessor as Rules chairman , former Representative Howard W. Smith of Virginia , had blocked legislation prior to adoption of the 21-day rule by refusing to call committee meetings . The rule was adopted in 1965 , , and under it the Rules Committee could not hold up legislation approved by another committee for more than 21 days . The Rules Comimttee filters almost all bills on their way to the floor . Administration leaders sought to retain the 21-day rule as an additional safeguard in the 90th Congress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a vote of 232 to 185 . Voting for it were 156 Republicans and 76 Democrats . Virtually all the Democrats were Southerners . Before 1965 , an informal coalition of Southerners and Republicans defeated much of the legislation coming from the White House . The coalition was broken by the 1964 elections , which sent a number of liberal Democrats to Congress . Representative Gerald R. Ford of Michigan , the House Republican floor leader , had said he was opposed to reviving the coalition as a formal unit . Republican leaders have said it gave the party a poor image and hurt the party in the South ; Democrats frustrated building up of the Republican party there , they said , by telling voters it was not needed because the Southern Democrats worked with the Republicans in Congress . This position of the Republican leaders , however . does not prevent Republicans and Southerners from voting together on an informal basis . The opening of the new Congress was accompanied by tumult and ceremony . The first hours were marked by the death of a prominent member , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uproar in the House over the efforts to bar Mr. Powell and by peace in the Senate , where the first Negro in almost a century , Edward W. Brooke of Massachusetts , was warmly greeted and sworn in . Senators were so much at peace , in fact , that they put off until tomorrow the opening of their biennial fight over whether to change the rule for ending filibusters . From one end of the Capitol to the other , corridors and galleries were overrun with visitors , who had come for ceremony and Protest . Several hundred friends of Mr. Powell stood on the steps outside the House wing shouting : " We want Mr. Powell back in his chair . " A Plea for Restraint In a caucus of Democratic Senators , the majority leader , Mike Mansfield of Montana , took the unusual step of advising his colleagues to exercise restraint in the days ahead . He said , in effect , that they should neither tear President Johnson 's Administration apart because of his Vietnam policy nor interpret the Nov. 8 election results as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the election , in which the Republicans gained 50 seats in Congress , " in no sense calls for the blowing of taps over the immensely constructive legislative programs of the KennedyJohnson Administrations . " " Rather , " he said , " the election of 1966 tells us , as the responsible Federal party , to take soundings . It tells us in the Senate not to ignore the nation 's needs but to exercise a soberness of judgment and a thoughtful restraint in weighing these needs . " " It urges us , " he continued , " to cooperate with the President in giving every possible sustenance and support to the men whose lives have been committed in Vietnam . " Finally , it compels us , with the President , to search for the only way in which the safety of those men and the nation 's safety and , in the last analysis , the world 's safety can really be secured . That is by ending the conflict in Vietnam at the soonest possible moment in a just and honorable peace . " Conservatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election of Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia to the No. 3 leadership position , that of secretary of the Senate Democratic Conference . He defeated a liberal , Joseph S. Clark of Pennsylvania . The vote , by secret ballot , was 35 to 28 . Senatory Byrd is an opponent of civil rights legislation , but on economic matters he usually votes with the liberal bloc . The post No. 3 after those of the majority leader and whip  - -  - carries little power but automatically makes Senator Byrd an ex-officio member of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee and of the Steering Committee , which makes committee assignments . Senator Byrd will also attend weekly breakfasts at the White House at which the President expounds his legislative views to Congressional leaders . He succeeds George A. Smathers of Florida , who voluntarily stepped down because he expects to retire from the Senate in two years . In the caucus Mr. Smathers did not offer to remain in the post , as some thought he would , to avoid a party split . The day began on an ominous note when Representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since 1941 , was found dead on his office floor , ? apparently of a heart attack . He was 53 years old . Mr. Fogarty 's death was a blow to President Johnson 's Great Society programs . As chairman of an appropriations subcommittee that allocated funds for the Departments of Labor and of Health , Education and Welfare he was known as a liberal prbvidcr who frequently exceeded the executive budget and sometimes gave agencies like the National Institutes of Health more than they asked . President Johnson said he was " shocked and saddened " by Mr. Fogarty 's death . The House normally meets and adjourns quickly following a member 's death , but , because it was opening day and the President was to address a joint session , leaders decided to proceed as scheduled and hold a memorial service later . In the Senate , Vice President Humphrey swore in the 35 newly elected members four at a time . Each ceremony was followed by a round of applause from the floor and the galleries . One of the most warmly received of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanied by his colleague , Edward M. Kennedy , Massachusetts Democrat . Southern segregationists shook Mr. Brooke 's hand , and a large crowd attended a reception for him . By unanimous agreement , 14 liberal Senators of both parties withheld until tomorrow a resolution seeking to ease the rule requiring a two-thirds vote to shut off debate . They did so on Mr. Mansfield 's recommendation that the fight be put off until after the President 's address . Senate Republicans elected George Murphy of California as chairman of the Republican Campaign Committee and Mrs. Margaret Chase Smith of Maine as head of the conference of all lRepublican Senators . Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania was named vice chairman of the committee headed by Mr. ( Murphy . Other Republican Ileaders were re-elected . Senator Scott had been considered a likely candidate of Republican moderates to head the campaign committee , but he did not have his name put up for the post . Afterward , he , sounded a note of Republican unity by declaring : " Senator Murphy and I will work closely for the election of a . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now controlled by the Democrats by 64 to 36 . The House has a 247-to-187 Democratic margin . The Republicans gained three Senate seats in the election last November and 47 House seats .
