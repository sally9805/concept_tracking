Defining the Issues <P> Sir : I now understand the difference between a statesman and a politician . Dean Rusk Feb. 4 is a statesman who understands the issues and knows what he is talking about . And he does it with dignity . <P> MICHAEL P. SPRINGER North Mankato , Minn . <P> Sir : Speaking neither as a " hawk " nor a " dove " but simply as an American , I say that we have a job to do in Viet Nam , and the only way to do it is to get with it ! Let us stop diddling around with unilateral and unnecessary concessions to the enemy ! <P> EDGAR W. RIEBE Metuchen , NJ . <P> Sir : The President has sought the intervention and good offices of the U.N . in resolving the conflict . But it would appear that the only role the U.N . can play is to advise and effect a confrontation of the right governments and powers . Only a conference in which the National Liberation Front confronts the U.S. admits of any real hope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way out of what now appears an impasse , and the U.N . once again will have been the instrument that has saved the world from holocaust . <P> BISHOP JOHN WESLEY LORD The Methodist Church The Washington Area Washington , D.C. <P> Sir : Now we 're bombing North Viet Nam again , following the counsel of our President 's advisers , who have the unenviable record of being 100% wrong in everything they 've advocated . A lot of people who did n't vote for Goldwater because of his bombing stand feel betrayed . <P> MRS . J. F. MONROE Milwaukee <P> Call for Help <P> Sir : It was with great interest that I read your article concerning Captain Ronald Rod and his efforts to help the people of Due Pho Dec. 24 . As his replacement , I have become all too painfully aware that a program such as the one he started is desperately . needed . It is my hope that civic organizations everywhere will take an interest in helping people in places like Due Pho . They can use all the help they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adviser Due Pho District Viet Nam <P> The Divorce Circus <P> Sir : Your Essay on divorce law Feb. 11 is a most articulate and fair summation of this chaotic legal circus . The tragedy of an unhappy marriage is multifaceted ; too often the legality of dissolving it only compounds the felony . Let us hope our state legislators will take a fresh , reasonable and realistic new look at this sensitive area . <P> ( MRS . ) SUSAN MORSE Manlius , N.Y . <P> Sir : Indeed , the time for divorce reform is now ! Your fact-loaded dissertation , however , neglects the most significant fact regarding divorce : throughout the country at least 90% of divorce cases are uncontested , and ordinarily the courts learn only what plaintiffs care to tell them . It is sheer nonsense for statutory law to concentrate on marital fault rather than a problem-solving approach while in real life , divorces by consent are being negotiated in law offices . Tragically , the contested cases usually involve greedy or spiteful spouses rather than a motivation to save the marriage . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Research Committee <P> Family Law Section , American Bar . <P> Association <P> New York City <P> " Greetings . . .
