It was not the kind of arithmetic that Art Modell , owner of the Cleveland Browns , could do on his fingers . Let 's see , now : 35,000 seats at $5 apiece , 20,000 seats at $4 , 20,000 at $3 . Space for 5,000 standees . We 'll charge them $3 too . That makes $330,000 . Of course , it 's partly for charity . So we donate $15,000 to that newspaper fund - " The Helping Hand . " Okay ? Then we 'll divide up what 's left , and . . . <P> Modell was not just dreaming . The opening of the pro-football season is still two weeks away , but this Saturday 80,000 rabid fans will elbow into Cleveland 's Municipal Stadium to watch the Browns v. the Green Bay Packers and the New York Giants v. the Detroit Lions in a pro-football " doubleheader . " The games are mere preseason exhibitions-the kind of practice scrimmage that no one used to notice . But now pro football is growing so wildly popular that no one can wait for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who ca n't get in see it all on TV . What 's more , the fans hardly even care that it is n't the real McCoy . <P> They sure do n't in Dallas , where the Cowboys play their exhibitions on Saturday and televise them the following day ; thousands of fans refuse to look at the Sunday sports pages until the telecast is over . They do n't care in Pittsburgh , either . After the Steelers lost their second straight exhibition to the Browns last week , one rooter groaned : " The season has n't even started , and already we 're waiting till next year . " <P> Monday-Morning Quarterbacks . It used to be that a coach could experiment in the preseason games and forget the score . But now there are all those eager faces in the stands , all those Monday-morning quarterbacks camped in front of all those TV sets . Two weeks ago , Harlan Svare took his Los Angeles Rams up to Portland , Ore. , for a scrimmage with the Dallas Cowboys . In the second quarter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so he benched Terry Baker-who hails from Portland . Thirty thousand fans booed everything Munson did . The Portland Reporter even ran an editorial claiming that the Rams had " cheated " the city . <P> All that was mild compared with the woes of New York Giant Coach Allie Sherman-a believer in the old-fashioned theory that preseason games do n't count . For three straight years , Sherman 's Giants have been the champions of the National Football League 's Eastern Division . But now they look more like chumps-at least on TV . They lost to the Minnesota Vikings , 21-7 , and Sherman insisted : " The defense looked good . " Then they ran into the Green Bay Packers and Halfback Paul ( " Golden Boy " ) Hornung , back from a year in Coventry for betting on games . Hornung passed for one touchdown , booted two field goals and four extra points , and the Packers trounced the Giants , 34-10 . The Giant switchboard lit up with wailing calls from fans who had seen it on TV . New York sportswriters loaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Y. A. Tittle had n't played much , and that Allie was " satisfied .
