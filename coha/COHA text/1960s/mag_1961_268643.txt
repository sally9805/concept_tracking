Sunday in New York , by Norman Krasna. has as its heroine an unhip news-chick who is 22 and given to wondering out loud whether she should give up her virginity . The chick ( Pat Stanley ) is assured by her air pilot brother ( Conrad Janis ) that nice girls should n't . Her millionaire boy friend walks out on her , contending that she should . Riding a Manhattan Fifth Avenue bus and nursing the blues , she hooks another eligible male ( Robert Redford ) - hooks him literally , with a barbed dress catch that rips out his breast pocket . They share a snack and a movie and get caught in the rain , that sly love god of synthetic playwrights . At the apartment she shares with her brother , they get out of their wet things and into some loose dialogue . Out go the lights , but he , it seems , has scruples about " beginners . " Back come the lights on the semi-robed twosome , in barges the boy friend , marriage-bent , out springs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pops the real brother . <P> Actors Stanley and Redford pump fresh air into Krasna 's saggy script , especially its laugh-shy first act . But they can not camouflage the fact that this type of play has long been outgrown by just about everyone whose first love was not a box office .
