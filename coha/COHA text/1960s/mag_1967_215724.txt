Beach Red . Peter Bowman 's moving free-verse novel about a Marine detachment on a World War II Pacific beach head was an understated masterpiece . In turning it into a film , however , Actor-Director Cornel Wilde has under lined its import so heavily as to convert Bowman 's subtle poetry into monumental mawkishness . The message , that war is hell and soldiers are better off holding hands with the girls back home , is pounded out with a naivete beyond belief . <P> As the men inch forward toward their goal , the action stops to let each one run over in his mind a private snapshot album of The Ways Things Were . And over across the hill , the Japanese are doing the same . Every cliche is in its niche : the sensitive downy-cheeked youngster who wants to be a lawyer ; the noble captain ( Wilde ) who tells the lad that he " will be a better lawyer for all this " ; the hillbilly hankering after " jes ' one more woman afore Ah git it . " Grisly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain sense of reality , but in the end blood and treacle flow at equal rate .
