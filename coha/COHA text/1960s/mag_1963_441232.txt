RALPH MCGILL , editor of the Atlanta CONSTITUTION , holds a unique position in the South . Born in Tennessee , educated in the public schools and at Vanderbilt University , he came of age at a lime when his homeland was being changed and shaken , and with courage and compassion he has spoken out against the double standard of democracy in the South . The following pages are drawn from his forthcoming book THE SOUTH AND THE SOUTHERNER , which received the Atlantic Nonfiction Award of $5000 . IN MORE than a quarter century of giving ear to Southern politicians , Klan speakers , and preachers ? and , in more recent years , the White Citizens Councils , mob members such as those of Little Rock , New Orleans , and , later , the Snopses at Ole Miss in Oxford , Mississippi , and the interposition-lots ? I came to believe in something of reincarnation , or the more likely fact of numbing unoriginality of minds prejudiced by race . Now and then someone came along like Uncle Earl Long , or the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vulgar invective , and demagoguery to preposterous heights of entertainment . But even they were playing their own arrangements of original composers . One summer vacation I used up some of the leisure hours culling the benders of regional twigs until I had four whose ideas , blasphemies , prejudices , sophistries , syllogisms , phrases of invective , and theories have been repeated most often since the Supreme Court decision of 1954 , and still are . It is unlikely that those who use them most are aware they are repeating . The words and phrases have for years been floating in the South 's political air , like motes in sunlight , to be breathed in and expelled . The twig benders left after culling were : Thomas Roderick Dew , 1802-1846 ; Benjamin Ryan Tillman , 1847-1918 ; James Kimble Vardaman , 1861-1930 ; Thomas Edward Watson , 1856-1922 . In reading of the early turbulent reasonless days when sectionalism grew in the South and the region began to think on how different it was , I was struck with how often both politicians and demagogues of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide substance for poor arguments . In 1831 it still was the custom of the Virginia legislature to look to the college of William and Mary for guidance . In that year the Assembly made a request of Professor Thomas Roderick Dew that he produce for them a summary of the long controversy on the abolition of slavery . There is no intent to injure the feelings of the professor 's ghost , but it is nonetheless true that the authors of the request knew that , whereas his predecessors in the chair of History , Metaphysics , Natural and National Law , Government and Political Economy , George Wythe and St. George Tucker , had been antislavery men , as were others on the faculty , Professor Dew was an ardent slavery man . The request from the Virginia legislature pleased him , and he eagerly responded . Professor Dew added no new knowledge to the assigned subject . But he did something which made the politicians more effective . He took all the arguments which had been made for slavery and gave them organization and a smooth , scholarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusions . His reasoning had a quality of polished , genteel finality . He was most persuasive to those eager and waiting to be persuaded . The professor began by casting his eyes back through history . Where were the great civilizations ? He saw them in Greece , in Rome , along the Nile . Captives , instead of being put to death , were put to work . The arts , architecture , freedom , private property , leisure ? in fact , the true civilizations ? flourished only where there was slavery . This was Dew 's preamble . He proceeded then to prove that slavery benefited the Negro . Unfitted for freedom by nature , he was given protection , care , and security by slavery . His lot was much more desirable , the professor found , than that of the miserable free worker who was exploited and meagerly paid in the North , where materialistic clamor and vulgar commercialism made civilization impossible . Professor Dew looked with benign eyes upon the slave owners of the South and saw them as characterized by " noble and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Selfishness might exist elsewhere , but was nowhere to be found among Southern slave holders . " It was " hristian " to care for inferior people , unfitted by intellect to be free . This was a harsh repudiation of Thomas Jefferson , who had , of course , been mistaken . All the sentiments so carefully collected and unchallenged in the seclusion of his academic cloister carefully were marshaled forth . He closed by asserting to his own and the legislature 's satisfaction ? and proving ? that slavery , far from interfering with the democratic form of government , made true democracy possible by bringing all white men to " one common level . " " We believe , " Professor Dew wrote , " that slavery in the United States has accomplished this , in regard to the whites , as nearly as can be expected , or even desired in this world . The menial and low offices are being performed by the blacks , there is at once taken away the greatest cause of distinction and separation of the ranks of society . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was white supremacy defined . There was no bitterness in Professor Dew . Out of his background of birth , and out of his seclusion with books , he believed even the more preposterous of his arguments . He delivered his lecture to the Virginia Assembly as if it were one of his classes , savoring its applause . So well pleased were its members that , at their suggestion , he had his paper published in Rich- mond , titled Review of the Debate on the abolition of slavery in the Virginia Legislature of 1831-1832 . So popular was it that a second edition was required . Soon other legislatures were repeating it . Pulpits rang with it . Newspapers printed large excerpts with extravagant endorsement . Already the various state and local political arrangers of Professor Dew 's composition were beginning to repeat it with their own variations and embellished interpretations . By the time Professor Dew died in 1846 there were voices rising in the land which were angry , defiant , demanding , pleading . South Carolina 's Robert Barnwell Rhett , son of New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williams College ; Virginia 's agronomist Edmund Ruffin ; and William Gregg , Virginia-born but long a South Carolina manufacturer , full of sound and fury , were already moving to occupy the stage , which they were to hold all through the 1850s . But Dew 's " classic statement " still served as the model . In all their Wagnerian thunders his theme could be heard . One feels that if the spirit of Professor Dew was around , it did not approve of the clamor . It was not good manners , and it did not jibe with his picture of a perfect , Greeklike civilization and the assured , poised culture which could flower only out of slavery . But the theme was his . BEN TILLMAN of South Carolina was a second mover and shaker , a bender of twigs . He had a youthful environment which was emotionally violent . He grew up a favorite of his widowed mother . Two brothers were killed in war . Another died of fever . When Ben was nine , an older brother , George , killed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jail . In his ears were the frequent sound of sobs and his mother 's resentful protests against such heavy blows from fate . The young Ben was his mother 's constant companion in managing the plantation and the many slaves . She had him tutored at home and later sent him to a private school . He became apt at English and Latin . In 1861 he left home to join the Confederate Army , but soon came down with a never fully diagnosed illness which made him a semi-invalid for two years and cost him the sight of one eye . Resentment and a sense of injustice became a part of his personality . In 1868 he married Sallie Starke of Elbert County , Georgia . His mother helped him to four hundred acres adjoining her holdings . It was land leached poor by many years of cotton cropping , and the returns from it were meager . He was an intense man , bitterly inhibited , spurred always by the feeling that life and fate had treated him shabbily . He was unattractive in appearance , quick-tempered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he dabbled ineffectively in county politics . By 1885 , discontent lay on all the farmlands of America . The fever of Populism ran hotly , and the emotions of it brought the Southeast and Midwest close to class warfare . Its yeasty ferment caused men long inarticulate to have the gift of tongues . In August of that year , near bankruptcy like most of his neighbors , Ben Tillman made a speech which caused men to talk . Their interests , he shouted at a meeting of farmers , were being betrayed by the merchants and lawyers , who fed on them and their poverty . From that day on he harried the farmers to organize . In every conversation or speech , he indicted the merchant and lawyer class with angry and violent charges of exploitation . Many of them were basically true and not too greatly exaggerated . He somehow hated the Negro . No one knew exactly why . It seemingly irritated him that Negroes were free . But whatever the reason , his hate was irrational and vindictive . The Negro , he declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was , perhaps , the missing link . Negroes , he argued , had produced no civilization of their own ; they were best off as slaves . Education of the Negro was a subject which excited him to near-hysteria . Education of people not suited for it , he shouted to his crowds of landless and discontented , to the hot-eyed small farmers with mortgages and crop liens on their depressed acres and crops , would bring on a bloody war between the races . His preachments were incredibly wild incitements to violence and restriction . The Negro became the scapegoat for all the resentments of small farmers and plantation owners caught in an economic and political squeeze . Nor did he restrict his tirades to his own county . By 1892 he was absolute master of South Carolina politics . At his fiery command distinguished men who had served their state nobly ? eminent Confederate War hero and aristocrat Wade Hampton among them ? were voted out of office and replaced by men who faithfully imitated their master . He had himself elected to the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the nation picturing the Negro to be a beast and a person unfit for citizenship or education . He sought to arouse sentiment in the Congress to abolish the Fourteenth Amendment and urged force to nullify the Fifteenth . A bitter foe of Grover Cleveland 's , Tillman had urged his followers in 1894 to " Send me to Wash-ington so I can stick my pitchfork in his Cleveland 's old ribs . " His mobs loved it and called him thereafter " Pitchfork Ben . " In 1896 , hoping for the Democratic presidential nomination , he addressed the party convention . His dark features , his savagely snapping jaws , his masklike face twisted with hate made him a fearsome figure . He lashed out as if one of his mobs were before him . Many approved . But he was too extreme to be a can8idate . They nominated William Jennings Bryan . The defeated man went back South , where crowds were more approving . Tillman fought President Teddy Roosevelt , charging him with hypocrisy in dealing with trusts . The President produced documents indicating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for himself . The charge was not proved , but it was so obviously true it damaged Tillman nationally . But not at home . He largely controlled South Carolina 's politics until he died , leaving many of the state 's best traditions overturned and passions loosed which are endemic in the political life of the South . The Southern states have never ceased to produce semi-reincarnations of him . JAMES KIMBLE VARDAMAN was one of these . Texas-born , son of a Confederate veteran , he was a shirttail boy when his family moved to a farm in Yalobusha County , Mississippi . But at twenty-one , James Vardaman was admitted to the bar and began to practice law at Winona and write for and edit the Winona Advertiser , a weekly , From 1890 to 1896 he edited the Greenwood Enterprise and served in the legislature . Later he founded his own newspaper , the Commonwealth . The young editor began to hear , above the rumbles of bitter class factionalism in the Democratic Party of his own state , the thunder of Tillman in South Carolina . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shrewd , coarse , vulgar , eloquent , ruthless , persuasive . Being a part of the unrest of his time , he decided to try the long leap from the legislature to the governorship . When he began his campaign for the governorship he rode on a large eight-wheeled lumber wagon . Eight yokes of carefully selected white oxen pulled him to the hustings . It was drama and color in a land which knew little entertainment . His audiences were the discontented , the landless , and the small farmer , the poor white man . The planters were the enemy ? the planters on the delta and the Negro , wherever they were . He had read Tillman , " My friends , " he would say to those first delighted audiences , " I know you will listen to me . My first audiences were barnyard animals and jackasses . " He had the demagogue 's necessary gift of communication . He easily established the tie of brotherhood with the discontented . " The political dominions of the white race , " he told them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the education of the Negro . " His attack on education for the Negro was then a shrewd political device , but there was no hypocrisy in his use of it . He believed it . He saw thus a force which might make him a personal power , above party . Many of his audiences had bolted the Democratic ticket to vote Populist . Vardaman did not want to become identified with Populism . He believed its followers would in time return to the Democrats . He saw his real opposition as the planter class , and he wanted to unite all other factions against it . His interest in the poor man seemed hotly sincere ? so long as the poor man was white . He , himself , noting how his yokes of white oxen caught on , began to dress in symbolic white and to let his black hair grow long , brushed down to his shoulders , for contrast . He encouraged the descriptive phrase " The Great White Chief . " He became the hero of discontent , its spokesman , its leader . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was reduced to a vocational status , and there was not much of that . State schools for Negroes were closed . He was defeated in a bid for the Senate in 1907 . In 1908 he began to publish a weekly paper at Jackson , the Issue . It continued to stir racial passions , to protest education for the Negro . In 1910 he was defeated by LeRoy Percy , gentleman and true aristocrat of the delta , whose son , Will Percy , author of Lanterns on the Levee , all his life was to fight the prejudices bequeathed Mississippi by Vardaman . It was a legislative choice , an earlier primary result having been declared invalid . Vardaman charged a steal by planters . In 1911 he won a primary and became a United States senator in 1912 . " The bottom rail is on top , " he shouted . And it was . But power had corrupted . He began to lose his touch . He fought Woodrow Wilson and the war . In 1918 Pat Harrison defeated him . His health began to break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved to Alabama and waited out death . TONI WATSON , another rallier and organizer of discontented men and prejudice in the South , was born in a small log house three miles north of Thomson , Georgia , on September 5 , 1856 . Congressman , nominee for the vice presidency on the Populist 's fusion ticket with William Jennings Bryan in 1896 , and United States senator , Watson dwarfed the Tillmans and Vardamans in sheer genius of intellect and ability . He had , like them , all the black arts of the politics of violence . But there was a time when the small farmers , owners , tenants , croppers , Negro and white , worshiped him next to God Himself , and , as one said , felt more sure of Watson . Negroes would crowd about him and touch his garments and go home and tell their families , " I seen him today . I seen him and heard him talk and touched his clothes . " He was the sworn foe of monopoly , not in the narrow sense of the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privilege , of wealth , of progress . He had , in his beginnings , to attack not merely the old social and political structures but the problem of race . His Populist struggle in the South was made more complex and bitter by it and the intellectual infamy of Tillman and Vardaman . But Watson attacked prejudice against the Negro fearlessly , and with an honesty never before seen in the political life of the cotton South ? and not heard since from any man of his political stature . His Populist program called for unity between the white and Negro farmers . Watson put his appeal in his usual simple but image-drawing words . " Now , the People 's Party says to these two men , You are kept apart that you may be separately fleeced of your earnings . You are made to hate each other because upon that hatred is rested the keystone of the arch of financial despotism which enslaves you both . You are deceived and blinded that you may not see how this race antagonism perpetuates a monetary system which beggars both . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He made public appearances before farmers deeply rooted in the old pattern of race hatreds and prejudices . They somehow were not made hostile to hear his voice crying out : " It should be the object of the Populist party to make lynch law odious to the people .. . " I nominate this man Negro to the executive committee of the Populist party as a man worthy to he on the executive committee of this party or any other party . ? . " Tell me the use of educating these people as citizens if they are never to exercise the rights of citizens .. . . " Watson spoke from platforms where white and Negro men sat . He spoke to mixed audiences . He never advocated any easing of segregation in the schools . But he did insist , emphatically , upon THE SOUTH HAS MANY FACES political equality . He held that the incident of color made no difference in the political interests of farmers , croppers , and laborers . He was the first native Southerner of political standing to give intelligent and sympathetic ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in post-Reconstruction years . He urged that the Negro , with a third party open , become an independent voter and cease being a pawn in the hands of the city and county machines . Trembling editors all over the state wrote of anarchy and Communism . The entrenched Democratic Party set out to defeat him for re-election in 1892 in the congressional primary . Another Watson victory , and he would rule the whole state . Bloodshed and fighting grew apace as the primary day drew near . Killings became common . Watson was defeated by the results in Richmond County , where the Democratic vote was almost double the number of legal voters . Negroes were hauled in wagons from farms and plantations into town and allowed to vote repeatedly by the Democratic county machine . Many more were brought across the Savannah River from South Carolina and voted . Watson ended his House career with the 52nd Congress and returned to Georgia to take up the Populist fight once more . In 1894 he angrily opposed Grover Cleveland 's policies . The fiery Populist advocated nationalizing the railroads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , with bitterness and violence flaring once more , Watson declared again for Congress . Once more , he came to Richmond County with a comfortable lead . Once more it was wiped out . It was so callous a steal that even the winner agreed to a new election . It was delayed until a new registration law was passed and thousands disfranchised . Again Watson was counted out . mANy men who knew him say it was this which broke him and almost overnight turned him from a people 's man into a reckless destroyer whose name became a byword for hate and fear and falsehood . Negroes who not long before had sought merely to touch his garments and had looked up to him with a reverence as to deities became his targets . He became obsessed with hatred and flogged them with words and phrases which sent men to hunting them like animals . He who had sought to end lynchings defended them . He turned his hate equally on Jew , Catholic , Negro . The splendid mind , once dedicated to people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to be unstable . What the corrupt use of Negrovotes in Richmond County had not done to his mind , the Populist convention of 1896 completed . He feared a sellout in all the talk of fusion . He would not attend the convention . Big money , he charged , was trying to persuade the Populists to join with the Democrats to ruin both . Bryan , the Democratic nominee , was nominated by the Populists . But they named Watson for vice president . The Populist convention impatiently waited while the slow telegraph relay brought word to Thomson , Georgia . Watson deliberated . At last , against his better judgment , he accepted , predicting political disaster to friends around him . He was right . Watson retired to his home on Hickory Hill . He was in debt . He felt that his mind was going . For the first time in his life , he accepted defeat and crept , brooding , into his tent . He began to write , with a brilliant , erratic style , books which sold well . His weekly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , filled with his writings . By 1904 he was engaged in disfranchising the Negro . Georgia 's notorious county unit system was a part of his plan . So violent were his tirades and his followers that the Georgia election of 1906 led to the Atlanta race riot which lasted for four days , causing looting , brutality , and murder . Contradictions made the onetime flaming mind , bent on social and political justice , paradoxical in the extreme . In one issue of his newspaper he defended the Russian Revolution , attacked monopolists , the railroads , and Wall Street , and bitterly assailed Booker T. Washington , the Negro race , Jews , and Roman Catholics . National progressiveness and Southern agrarianism no longer were going along together . To the dismay of men and women all over America who had followed him as the first compelling crusader for human rights to come in their generation , Watson sought to lead them into strange paths . And so ran out the sands of decency , honor , and greatness . The Tom Watson who walked into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerged . The Watson who emerged had enough drama of vocabulary and prejudice to win election to the United States Senate in 1920 , when reaction against the war years and the League of Nations was at its peak . By then he was a drunken old man , racked by asthma , subject to colds , but still a dangerous opponent who knew no rules . He spoke out , now and then , for the underdog . Occasionally his family saw flashes of the old sweetness they had known when he was the people 's man . But mostly it was whiskey and bitterness and brooding melancholy which darkened and dominated his mind . On the night of September 25 , 1922 , he died . His last words were , " I am not afraid of death . " He was n't . The largest floral offering at the grave was from the Ku Klux Klan . His legends still haunt the state . Twenty years ago I went to Thomson , seeking men who knew him , old Populists or their sons . At dusk we walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hill , then shuttered and lonely . " I remember him as a boy , " said one of the younger men . " We used to run up this concrete pathway and yell , ' Hello , old crazy man ! ' We were shaking and scared , because he was a mean-looking old man and we were afraid of him . " " Tom was n't mean , " said an older man in the group . " Tom loved children , but Tom was fey . He could go off in his mind and leave his body walking around , and it was bad to cross him when his mind was off somewhere . " " I remember , " said another of the older men , " one day I had gone to see him to get him to write a letter to Washington for me . We were sitting there talking when all at once he threw up his head like a setter dog smelling birds , and I could see him listening . I listened , too , and I could hear a farm bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he said , Goddamn that man ! He rings that bell just to worry me . ' " The damnedest sight I ever saw , and one to chill your blood , and one that smelled of death though there was no death in it , though it was close enough to smell it , was that day when the word got out his opposition was going to kill Tom . All over this part of the country men began to hitch up . They 'd throw a sack of corn and a tie or so of fodder in the wagon , and the old lady would come out with some cooked-up cornbread , a sack of meal , some ham meat and eggs , a skillet , and some quilts . For two days the roads coming to Hickory Hill emptied themselves of grim-faced men , usually two of them to a wagon , with two shotguns between them on the seat . They drove to Hickory Hill , took out the mules , and built little fires around and cooked something to eat and coffee . They did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't talk with Tom . They just slept in their wagons on some old quilts or sat hunkered around , talkin ' . " They did n't nobody kill Tom , and the hotheads that usually was willin ' to shoot off their lip about him was quiet as sayin ' the blessin ' at dinner . After two days , them fellers hitched up and went home . They were the real Populists , the old Pops . And you know , they never was one of them stories swept the country again . Lots of people wanted to kill him , but they talked it mighty lose . " The Watson ghost will not let one rest . What might the South have become politically had Watson and his Populist coalition of Negroes and farmers , with their racially mixed executive committee , won control , as they almost did ? What might the race problem have become if the Negro had won the ballot ? What might the inheritance of that have meant , instead of the harvest of hate and disfranchisement ? His legend will not let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not at all a coincidence that all the South 's racist demagogues whose names became nationally known were from four states ? South Carolina , Mississippi , Alabama , and Georgia . Alabama 's contribution of a nationally recognized name was Thomas ( Tom-Tom ) Heflin . In all of them , and their lesser , local imitators , and in those who keep coming on , are reincarnated some of the phrases , thoughts , prejudices , invective , irrelevancies , and distortions of Dew , Tillman , Vardaman , and Watson . KU KLUX KLAN In 1913 the Lyric Theater at Fifth and Market streets in Chattanooga plastered its display areas with large lithographs depicting a rearing , pawing , hooded , sheet-covered horse , bearing on its back a man similarly garbed . The film Birth of a Nation was coming to town . It played night after night to a packed house . All I can remember about the reaction to it is that some of the boys with whom I played told of hearing their fathers say there had been some trouble in the Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any Southerner born near or after the turn of the century was to know the revived Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s as part of his educational processes . As a young part-time reporter in Nashville , I saw my first big Klan parade and the numerous publicity stunts . A small group of rabid Klansmen would appear on a Saturday night at a Salvation Army street meeting , drop a roll of bills , usually twenty-five dollars or fifty dollars , on the drum , and silently walk away . On Sundays they would visit a church , walking in as the collection was being taken and depositing a roll made large by the presence of many one-dollar bills on the plate . So great was my innocence of the Klan that it did not occur to me in those first days of its public appearance that the ministers of the churches so visited were members of the Klan . I was early inspired to wisdom by my managing editor , Marmaduke B. Morton of the Nashville Banner . He growled that the Klan was a lot of damned nonsense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bedford Forrest had done . General Forrest had disbanded the old Reconstruction Klan because it had become a cover for rascals . But beyond this , I knew little . A query brought from Mr. Morton a profane denunciation of the content and teaching of Southern history . Not to know of the crimes committed by the robed Klan , he said , was evidence of a native lack of curiosity , unpardonable in a newspaper reporter . A man might have had poor teaching , but he could not be excused for not teaching himself , he said . So I went to the library and educated myself on the old Klan . It was more crime and brutality than it was romance . It got out of hand almost as soon as it was expanded beyond the social club created at Pulaski , Tennessee , by seven bored young men . It did not , as Southern legend has it , do more good than harm . The 1920s saw the revived Klan become one of the major news sources ? in politics , brutalities , murders , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faithful . When I went to the Atlanta Constitution in the spring of 1929 , with Mr. Morton 's words still in my ears , I began to gather information about the Klan and the men who had re-established it , I met , in the next several years , a half dozen or so men who had been a part of it and who were not merely willing to reminisce about it , but who enjoyed doing so . They gave me a picture of the rise and fall of the second " Invisible Empire . " They had a fine fund of stories , and they especially enjoyed talking about William Joseph ( Doc ) Simmons , who revived the original Ku Klux Klan . The story began about 1912 . At that time Doc was , they said , a pious , prissy-walking , big man . Lodge badges and charms were heavy upon him , and he carried this burden joyously . Their weight was well distributed on lapel , vest , fingers , or hung pendant-fashion from the heavy gold watch chain which was the hallmark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . His britches were rump-sprung , his old cronies recalled with laughter , from much sitting in the wooden chairs of lodge rooms , rural church pews , offices of county and municipal politicians , and the severe , high-backed chairs found behind pulpits . Mints and cloves wrestled with the bourbon on his breath , deceiving the good ladies of the W.C.T.U. , but causing the knowing to speak of him with the half-condemning , half-affectionate , sometimes profane phrases reserved for the amiably fraudulent who manage to be equally at home leading prayer , preaching , taking a dram , or making a fourth at poker . Doc Simmons was always proper . His gates-ajar collar was ever clean . The diamond pin stuck just below the large , generous knot in his conservative tie was small , as befits gentility . " Old Doc , " they would say , " was a card , a real card . Too bad you did n't know him . " Behind him was failure as a medical student and as a minister of the Methodist faith and its rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an exhorter who somehow never made the first division in what was and is in the South a very fast , highly competitive evangelical league . By 1915 , he was Colonel Simmons . The title had been conferred upon him as a leader of the uniformed drill team of the Woodmen of the World , for whom Colonel Simmons sold memberships with insurance burial benefits . He was a good salesman . Many an old rural graveyard in Alabama , Georgia , and Florida yet includes , amid the conventional markers , the chiseled marble tree-trunk section , a grave marker which was thrown in with the coffin and the burial insurance payment . Colonel Simmons was routinely at some sort of lodge meeting three or four nights a week . It was not surprising that he began to think of an insurance-benefit secret order of his own from which he would receive the large profits , not merely the salesman 's commission . At that time , the history-making movie Birth of a Nation was playing at local theaters , and salesmen went to movies on lonely nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw and evaluated the enthusiasm aroused by the movie . This gave him an original idea . It was , so far as the record reveals , his first and last . But it was a big one . In speeches that followed , he used to let his voice take on a deep solemnity , as befits discussion of visions , and say that one night , while sitting quietly before a window in spiritual meditation , he saw a vision of white horses riding across the sky with white-robed figures mounted on them , and from that derived the holy command to reorganize the Ku Klux Klan . IN THE autumn of 1915 , Colonel Simmons launched his plan . He approached a number of Atlantans , most of them prominent in politics . One of these was city clerk Walter Taylor , a rotund man later to go to jail for fraud . " Walter , " said Doc , in his best prayer-meeting voice , " I am asking a few carefully chosen friends to meet me atop Stone Mountain Thanksgiving night , at midnight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ku Klux Klan . " " Jesus , Doc , " Taylor said , " I ca n't climb Stone Mountain in the daytime . Ca n't you revive the ancient glories in the flatlands ? " Despite such facetiousness , the glories were revived atop the mountain . Fifteen men were present . But all , including Doc Simmons , were lacking in imagination . They did n't know what came next . Simmons was thinking of insurance policies and cash . But war was flaming in Europe . The Klan stagnated . 1111920 , Doc was still around with his somewhat anemic Klan . An uncertain destiny brought him to E. Y. Clarke , who , with a blowsy lady associate , was running a shoestring advertising office , Clarke had a razor-sharp mind where the possibilities of a fast dollar were concerned , especially a shady dollar . A smarty in the con-man manner , Clarke was the perfect character to launch the Klan . Doc 's speeches , like his sermons , had heretofore lacked substance , but as they poured from the pen and mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God and Christ , the Ten Commandments , brotherly love , purity of womanhood , morality , patriotism , the flag , and onehundred-percent Americanism . Speakers and organizers were trained to go about spreading the word . The Roman Catholic Church was the chief target . In rural churches and lodge rooms , organizers shouted Clarke 's words of warning . The Pope was coming to America . The Catholic conspiracy was to destroy us all . Only the K.K.K. and one-hundred-percent Americanism would save us . The Negro and any foreign-born man were also outside the pale . But it was the Pope and his church who served as the main target . It was Clarke who saw also the political possibilities in the courthouse and state machines  - -  the chance to sell and give jobs to Klan members . It was a pushover . The climate was right . America was disillusioned by the sear . Isolationism , America for Americans , was in the air . Attorney General Palmer 's hysteria about Reds , the depression of 1920-1921 , the rural discontent , unemployment , the strikes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern cities ? all these created a perfect climate and soil for Klan development . The money poured in . " I remember seeing drawers full of greenbacks out there at headquarters , " said Bill Sharpe , one of my informants who had known Doc Simmons . " God alone knows how much they took in in those years . They thought it would go on forever . " Within a short time , Clarke was the Klan . Doc Simmons was less and less careful about using cloves . He liked the ladies , and Clarke knew plenty . " Hell , " said Bill Sharpe . " In no time at all , Clarke had Doc hog-tied with indiscreet letters to certain ladies . He claimed to have what is called incriminating pictures of Doc , although this I never believed . But Clarke was running things , and Doc was on a salary . Doc was sittint , around daily in a perpetual state of bourbon-beatitude , no longer consulted by Clarke . He did n't seem to care . He had money ; people called him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doc , and him there mellow-drunk , with his habitual courtesy and brotherhood . A lot of them hated Clarke , " Some used to wonder , though , " he continued , " why Doc did n't seem worried . Clarke knew . He knew , too , the boys were after him . They wanted to be cut in deeper . That 's why , when he figured the decline was at hand , he took all the cash he could and got out to begin his big real-estate promotion that blew up with the Depression . Clarke went on to go to jail in a Chicago songbook fraud . God knows how much money he got from the Klan , but it was plenty ! " When Hiram Evans and his rebels finally got enough power and prepared to oust Doc on a charge of having looted the Klan along with Clarke , they found out why he never worried . The name , property , and everything it owned , except the members themselves , were copyrighted and registered in the name of William Joseph Simmons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a first and middle name . " The big-money glow was still on the Klan , so Hiram Wesley Evans , who left his dentist 's office to run the Texas Klan , formed a syndicate and bought out Simmons for $140,000 . He was installed as Imperial Wizard on November 24 , 1932 . The Depression of the thirties came on . Big money was ended . The invisible empire of the Klan , which had brought many states closer than they knew to control by a fascist organization , was dropping from an estimated four million members to a few thousand . ( Clarke had claimed state offices in forty-one states and members in forty-seven . ) At its peak , it had elected many governors , senators , congressmen , judges , and countless local politicians . It had ruled with intimidation , terror , and murder in such widely separated states as Indiana and Louisiana . It had controlled police and sheriffs where it did not have the governor or mayor . That was a critical period for the nation and a story never really told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenties , so favorable to the Klan , withered away . Doc EVANS ? " the Wiz , " as he came to be called ? saw that the big money from memberships was gone with the wind and began to liquidate . Some of the Klan property was sold to make payment on back taxes . The Roman Catholic Church bought the white-pillared twostory house which had been the Imperial offices of the Klan and remodeled it for use as a rectory . A cathedral even then was going up on adjoining land . This galled the old Klansmen , and they began to discuss ways and means to oust Evans , who had sold the property . What they did not know was that Doc Evans himself wanted out . An unexpected way out developed . Bishop Gerald P. O'Hara had arrived in Atlanta a year or so after the publication of Margaret Mitchell 's Gone With the Wind . He was an immediate sentimental success , even with those who had their doubts about the bishop 's church . After all , was n't Scarlett O'Hara 's very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charm , energy , and intelligence , the bishop stirred the diocese to greater effort and enthusiasm than it had ever known . The cathedral was beautiful evidence of this energy . One day the bishop called me on a matter he wanted to discuss . The cathedral was to be consecrated within a few months . He was , he told me , with a great look of innocence on his face , considering inviting the Wizard of the Klan to be present . The magnificence of the idea overwhelmed me but did not cause me to overlook the transitory thought that the bishop , had he put his mind to it , could have become a master poker player . His idea was , I said , a stroke of genius , and he must certainly proceed . It was something which would become a national story for the newspapers , wire services , picture magazines , and newsreels . Either way , I said , he had the Wizard . If he refused , the nation would learn what many persons in Georgia did not know ; namely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imperial Palace of the Klan . If he accepted , so much the better . " You think so ? " asked the bishop , but this time he did show a twinkle in his eye . I said it could n't fail . " I would hope , " he said , " that it would also be good for his soul to be with us when the cathedral is dedicated to the glory of God . " The invitation was sent , and the Wizard , who was no fool , accepted . He came with his family . To have remained away would have been a complete humiliation . To be there was , of course , merely a lesser one . But , as he later said to a friend , " I was there . " The service was one of consecration . There was no reference to the K.K.K. But there was an electric quality in the air . In addition , an almost unbelievable thing happened . In a movie script it would be rejected . But it is a literal truth that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky . The stained-glass windows broke up the sun into shafts of light . Allthrough that ritual of consecration a shaft of wheat-golden light was on the Wizard . This is one of my favorite memories of the Wiz ? his benign , round , Halloween-pumpkin face lighted by one of God 's rays . I was awed by it , and that evening I said to Bishop O'Hara , " It was really unfair of you to arrange for that shaft of light to rest on the Wizard 's head . You should n't have gone that far . " " Who are you and I , " he said , " to question where the sun shall shine ? God knows best . " So , we left it at that . ( All through the years the bishop has been a person for whom I have had great affection . ) Days later , the Wiz sent word . " You were hard on me , " he said , " but , not for publication , I will tell you I was not a fool . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Wiz did n't just walk out . The K.K.K. has always been a commercial skin game , like the anti-Semitic rackets . The Wiz sold to Dr. James H. Colescott and Dr. Samuel Green . ( The Does were back again . ) Colescott was a veterinarian . The wits said this was the first time the members had had one professionally trained to minister to them . But the Klan slid downhill . Colescott ran into a demand from the federal government for the balance due on back taxes on monies collected across a long span of years . The Klan had believed itself above paying income taxes . In something of a panic , Colescott announced the Klan dissolved and surrendered its charter . Grand Dragon Doc Green took out another charter and began trying to stop desertions , the formation of new and rival Klans , and to rally the faithful under his banner . Ironically , he often referred to one of the competing Klans , The Original Southern Klans , Inc. , as a fascist group . EXCEPT for the shrewd , cynical men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Klan membership was made up of men whose lives were sterile and whose backgrounds were barren . This was true in city and county . One of the strengths of the Klan and of other extremists ' groups was and is the fact that the persons who make up the rank and file often feel resentments and frustrations because of grievances , real or fancied . Often they are mere complaints . But they do not know how to go to their city councilman or to the mayor . And so some promoter tells them it is the fault of Negroes or Jews and that if they will pay ten dollars to join the Klan , they will have protection and power . Some enjoyed the childish mumbo jumbo of the robes and ritual . But there was nothing in the Klan for them . They were suckers . It used to grieve me , thinking of how badly their families could have used what went to the Klan promoters . Another of the more depressing features of the Klan was the appearance of a women 's auxiliary , and later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now and then there would be a demonstration . Cities grew used to seeing members appear in numbers of fifty or so , in which robed family groups would be prominent . There was an almost overwhelming pathos in seeing boys and girls of ages from about six to ten walking along with their parents . When the Second World War rolled over Europe I had become convinced that at least some Klan leaders were trying to effect some sort of association with Fritz Kuhn 's German Bund groups in the East . Both raged against Franklin D. Roosevelt and were irrationally anti-Semitic . It was not possible to dig this out . But , in 1947 , on a second visit to the Nuremberg trials , I learned that Kuhn was a prisoner there and obtained permission to talk with hint . It was a rewarding hour . Kuhn was brought in . He was a gross , coarse-looking man at best , and the prison garb of khaki trousers and shirt emphasized these qualities of appearance . He had been brought from his job of peeling potatoes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man had once swayed a crowd which filled Madison Square Garden . The first questions were about his visit to Hitler , taking a donation of American money . It was a fascinating thing to see excitement change his face and light his eyes as he retold the supreme moment of his life , when Adolf Hitler had shaken his hand and congratulated him on his work in organizing a Nazi Bund in the United States . After this I asked hint if the Ku Klux Klans had ever approached him . " Oh , yes , " he said . " We had two meetings about it . The Southern Klans did not want to be known in it . So the negotiations were between representatives of Klans in New Jersey and Michigan , but it was understood the Southerners were in . We all approved of what Hitler was doing . Had Roosevelt not brought us into the war , we would have got together against the Jews and the Negroes . " Kuhn event back to Isis potatoes . In the post-war years , in which Adolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so thoroughly exposed , the Klan became more and more preposterous . There was no longer any real money to be made from it , and this , more than morality , accelerated the decline . Also , the Klan had ceased to be a mystery . Somehow , everyone knew what was behind those masks . In cities Negroes began to look on casually and to jest about the parades . It was different , of course , in the rural areas , where the sheriff and the deputies , and perhaps the judge , were members . There the terror still lived . But the Klan was dying . The White Citizens Councils , which sprang up like weeds in the wake of the 1954 school decision , finished the K.K.K. as a major force . What was left of it became a refuge for the small group of violent anti-Semitic and anti-Negro crackpots . Among these were the terrorists who did the dynamiting of schools , homes , and churches . It was dangerous because of this . But as an organization with political influence it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Councils suffered from the fact the public equated them with the various K.K.K. 's . In Alabama , Mississippi , and South Carolina , the Councils and Klans in some areas had near-duplicate membership . There were exceptions , but in general the White Citizens Councils were so tarred with Ku Klux Klanism that they did not flourish save in a handful of states . Try as they would , the Councils could not escape the appropriateness of their description as " the white-collar K.K.K. " It seems to me , looking back on it , that , overall , the K.K.K. had one asset . The fact that the antiNegro-rights forces have always included a heavy strain of anti-Semitism made it easier for those of a mind and will so to do to expose the old Typhoid Marys of the hate business who were operating in the climate created by the Klan and their white-collar contemporaries . No matter what new , high-sounding patriotic names they gave to their new traps for suckers , it was possible for the diligent to expose them . Life had an added zest for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and titles , who could feel compassion for the men whose lives were so sterile they felt themselves men only when they were robed and masked and in the presence of the phony mysteries of the order , and who could see and expose the contradiction in the Klan 's claims to Americanism and its subversion of American principles , and who knew the cover it gave to scoundrels . In their own peculiar way , the Klans were educational . WHAT THE DEPRESSION TAUGHT US There was in the South an excitement about the early Depression years of the 1930s which ameliorated the harshness of them . There was a mighty surge of discussion , debate , self-examination , confession , and release . THE SOUTH HAS MANY FACES Few towns were too small to have their study groups . The demand for panel members and speakers was steady . Aligned with faculty members from Emory University and Georgia Tech , I traveled much of the state to spend a day investigating and half a night in argument and in question-and-answer hours . There were sharecroppers and tenants to visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessions and existence were eloquent evidence of the inequities of an agricultural social and economic system which had ground to a halt . I recall thinking , with a surge of pity , on seeing them on the roads , sometimes whole families of them , ragged , now and then barefooted , I had never before seen despair . There was the rough , scaly skin of pellagra victims , the thin bodies and hot eyes of the chronic malaria sufferers . We got to know U.S. Public Health doctors and technicians who encouraged us to peer through microscopes and learn to identify hookworms . We saw and we talked . There was stimulation in those days . Gone , finally , were the myths of white-pillared mansions and a magnolia-scented civilization . There were days , as we drove along the rural roads , when it seemed as if distorting veils had been removed and we could , for the first time , see the cotton South . I remember one day in the small south Georgia town of Waverly Hall a man said , " The real enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a certain type ? small-town rich man . " He oversimplified , but he was speaking out of a lifetime of experience with such men . Until the Depression of the thirties was piled atop that of the boll weevil twenties , every town in the South had at least one of this certain type . He was a fascinating study , now and then charming of manner , but more often repellent and hard . Usually he lived in the best house on the best hill in the town , or at the shadiest corner , a block or so off the main street , and always his home sought to sustain the legend of the South as a place of many mansions . He owned , according to his geographic location , the gin , the turpentine works , the cotton warehouses , the tobacco warehouses . He was a director in the bank . He teas the owner of all or part of the biggest store . From it he sold fertilizer , plows , machinery , food , fencing , seeds , patent medicines , poultry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liens on crops and mortgages on livestock . At least one of the popular automobile agencies was in his name , or owned by a brother , uncle , or son . He controlled credit . He knew the financial predicament of every man in his section of the county . He horse the United States senators , andthe congressman from his district seas always a friend . He could write to Washington about a job for someone in his community . He could do the same with the governor . He called at the governor 's office when he journeyed to the state capital . He made a contribution at campaign time , always to the right man , and if in doubt , to both candidates . He had a hand in the political patronage in his county . He " advised , " or selected , the men who ran for the legislature .. He was , more often than not , a deacon in his church . If not a deacon , he was a pillar , in that he gave liberally . He seas wont to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preacher . " He had n't much time for books himself , but took a tolerant pride in the fact his wife belonged to the new Book-of-the-Month Club and collected antiques . He liked to tell the boys at the drugstore or at the office about the time his wife stopped him walking along a street in New York and made him go in with her and buy " some damned antique thing she saw in a window . " He usually owned and operated a few farms , taken in on foreclosures . If he farmed one or more of these , he drove a hard bargain with his tenants , kept them in debt as much as possible , and let the tenant shacks go until the wind blew them over . He enjoyed saying he wished he were half as well off and as happy as " his niggers , " who did n't know any better than to be happy . These men had a saying common to them all ? " Nigger is nigger and cotton is cotton , and that 's the way it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man hated Roosevelt , the New Deal , the triple A ( Agricultural Adjustment Act ) , and the Federal Land Bank , which took mortgages and farm loans out of his hands . He damned the W.P.A. because it took assay farm labor . In the towns he cursed it because his handyman , who had been taking what compensation he could get , chose the W.P.A. 's six dollars or eight dollars per week instead of his fifty cents or seventy-five cents per day . He hated all union labor . If the organizers came to his cotton mill , as they did in the late thirties , he encouraged the Ku Klux Klan to run them out of town . He did not want new industries in " his " town . They competed for " his " labor . He fondly regarded himself as the bulwark of all that was best and of the Southern " traditions . " If one asked him to delineate the traditions , he would flounder and stammer and find no words , save to say , " You know damn well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , mentally marking down the questioner as a person possessing " leftish " tendencies . If he were of the more arrogant type , he would condemn you as one of those " goddamned Reds . " He was willing to corrupt , to debase politics , to fight with all his weapons anything which seemed likely to diminish his power in his domain . In those years I came to know many of these men . Some had admirable traits . Some had so much personality and charm it was impossible not to have an undeceived liking for their company . Yet I do not recall one who could be called wholly admirable . Their counterparts existed , of course , in other regions . They were , in a sort of malignant rural miniature , like the giant figures of the robber barons , who operated on a national and international scale . They never questioned their belief that the country belongs to him who can exploit it . But since the South had for so long lived with the poverty of a one-crop system , one-party politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the type described were incredibly ruthless and lacking in conscience when it came to exploiting those dependent on them , Negro or white . They saw the taking of a tenant 's mule or wagon to satisfy some unmet crop or credit lien as merely part of an agreement . That they had made and set its terms , and perhaps made impossible its fulfillment by exorbitant rates of interest and price markups , was a satisfying piece of business . I do not recall one of these who could be described as a Southern aristocrat to fit the legend . Sometimes one had married the daughter of an old family which was of the planter aristocracy . However , almost without exception these men were of the yeoman , small-farmer class who had clawed their way up through cotton with shrewd , unconscionable practices . As the thirties began , they and their feudal holdings and practices were in trouble . Cotton then began to lose its export market , partly because of the Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act ratified in 1930 . Not long thereafter United States capital moved abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we have seen all too plainly , breeds nationalism . The cruel Depression set many forces in action . There were revolutions in agriculture as well as in technology and the structure of world power . The cotton South would never again be the same . We knew that by 1933 . The Second World War reaffirmed that conclusion . It was on a scale terrifyingly vast and expensive in dollars and lives . Much of the war capital flowed South to create new pressures . As usual , the members of the old oligarchy rallied wherever they could to keep wages in the new war plants held to the local scale . But there were others who could be heard in Washington , and they said , " For God 's sake , be sure the national wage rates are paid . Low wages have been the South 's curse . Help us break out of the past . " SUDDENLY it seemed , by 1942 , everyone had money . The situation was not without humor , and exposure of selfish folly at its preposterous worst for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers . By the summer of 1942 the South surprisingly found itself almost out of cooks . Since there had always been a surplus of cooks , who as a consequence were poorly paid , the shortage became an outlet for all the frustrations produced by the changing South . It was , many angry wives said , caused by all the New Deal coddling of Negroes . That was the season the stories about Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt began to be heard in drugstores , Pullman smoking rooms , in the lulls between the songs at the civic clubs , and in all the homes where cookless ladies met at tea or lunch . Nor was it merely that Southern kitchens were out of cooks . Maids were also scarce . And this was , of course , too much to endure . Not to have a cook , or at least a girl who came to clean two or three days a week , was a sign of social inferiority . It became very easy to decide that Mrs. Roosevelt , who had interested herself in the issue of civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook telephoned to quit , or , as was more often the case , simply did n't show up at all because she had a job in a war plant ? or her husband did . The summer of 1942 also saw the first Southern hearings of the Fair Employment Practices Committee . These deliberations , which some editors and community leaders said threatened the traditions , were the subject of many outraged editorials , speeches , and resolutions . The outbursts , with preposterous irrelevance , centered on Mrs. Roosevelt . She became the issue . It was ridiculous and occasionally frightening . All the resentment at the very idea of an FEPC , at the lack of a cook , a yard man , or a butler was concentrated in spiteful talk about Mrs. Roosevelt . It found outlet in epithets and stories of all degrees of silliness and bad taste in which she was the central theme . The newspaper editorials were even worse . They ran all the way from that of the Jackson , Mississippi , News , which began , " It is blood on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Harlem for Eleanor . " The nation has known no more disgraceful , hysterical display of immaturity . The rumors were endless . Chief among them was the " Eleanor Club " myth . No one ever discovered an Eleanor Club of Negro cooks and housemaids . Here and there an amateur effort to form labor union was discovered , but Mrs. Roosevelt had no part in it . Later on , the Eleanor Club rumors were to give way to the " Disappoint You Clubs . " Each was supposed to consist of at least ten Negro cooks who would telephone at least ten want-ad addresses and promise to come to work . They would then disappoint the cookless ladies by failing to show up . This , too , was a myth , although some good matrons likely will go to their deathbeds believing it . " I ca n't wait for this war to end and to have them the cooks ) come crawling back , " wrote one small-town matron to her local paper . Few people understood they were seeing the visible beginnings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his welfare . They were small beginnings , but they were plain to all who were willing to see . The kitchens were never to fill up again , at least not in the old way , any more than would the empty tenant cabins . The forces loosed by the Depression , the war , and Franklin Roosevelt 's political coalition had already rubbed out " Nigger is nigger and cotton is cotton " and all that this crude inanity implied , though some time would be needed to make that clear . TiERE was a south Georgia afternoon I can not , and do n't want to , forget . It was late in August , 1939 . Heat lay heavily on the land . There was dust on the goldenrod blooming on the edges of the roadside ditches . The leaves on the lower branches of trees along the way were dusty . The Negro county agent , who was driving , talked of the farm and the farmer we had just left . A young Negro agricultural school graduate had bought land on the tenant purchase plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent . " His wife has sense . He has those nice pigs . He has corn and a field of peanuts into which Ile can turn the pigs . He 'll make a bale and a half of cotton . He has a tractor . He 'll do all right . " I nodded , remembering the young man and his wife , who had been surprised and a little self-conscious to have a newspaperman walk over their land , look at the pigs , and ask questions about the hybrid corn . ( I spent most of that summer going around writing about farmers selected by the county agents as having done good bootstrap jobs . ) " I live just down the road a piece , " said the agent , as the car bumped along . " Would you like to stop for a glass of iced tea and some cake before I take you into town ? " I said I would . He was silent for a minute . We had never met until that morning . " There is something I need to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will understand . " " About what ? " " My house . I do n't want you to be surprised or not understand . " " I 'm not sure what you mean , but do n't worry about it . " He nodded . He was silent as see crested a rise , drove on down the slope and halfway up another , pulled olf to a small , weather-stained house , unprepossessing in its fading brown paint . The yard was clean-swept dirt . We got out of the dusty Chevrolet . His wife had opened the door and stood on the top of the steps . " It 's Mr. McGill , " he said . " Come in , " she said . " It 's been real hot , has n't it ? " We went in . And then I understood what he had been driving at and could n't bring himself to say . I stood there , shame crowding through me and a heavy sadness on me . " We 'd like some tea , " he said , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was paneled with a stained , native pine . There were some bright rag rugs on the floor . There was an upright piano at one corner . Three or four conventional prints , of the cheerful rural-scene type , were on the wall . " You did all this yourself ? " " The wife and I ? and our son , before he went to the army . " " It 's awfully nice . " " We like it , " he said . " I understand what you were trying to say , and I 'm ashamed you felt you had to say it . " " Well , " he said , " you know hose it is . " " Yes , I know , but I never felt it this way before . " " Well , I did n't want you to be surprised by the inside . But it 's best this way . A lot of people would n't understand . A lot of people are funny about things . They think you are getting too big for your place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So we just do n't attract attention . We leave the outside like it is . But we live on the inside . They do n't come in , you know . They holler and I go out . " The tall glass of tea sweated in my hand , and my shirt , wet across the back and about the neck with the sweat of the day , seemed tight and uncomfortable . Here were a man and his wife , with a son in the army of their country , and mine . The husband and father was a Negro county agent ? not simply a county agent . He could work only with Negroes . He was so earnest a worker and so well grounded in agriculture , and with a sort of passion to teach it , that Negro farmers in his county had attained a reputation for modest successes . They won prizes in the Negro section at the county fair . Their wives canned vegetables and put up pickles and preserves . The farms all had a look of neatness about them . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wells . But it would not do for the man who was responsible for all of this to appear uppity by making his place attractive to the passerby . It had to be almost a secret , inside thing . The white people in the county seat liked him . They spoke well of him . But he never wore a good suit to town , except on Sundays , and he did not let it be known that the rooms of his house were paneled , or that there was a piano in the living room and framed prints on the wall . There would have been some , as he said , who would n't have liked it . It was one of those things which he and I understood ? a dark , mysterious , hateful thing , never written out or said , but a part of what was meant , in rural sections , by that well-rounded phrase , " Southern customs , " or " ways . " We talked , sitting there , drinking the iced tea and eating oatmeal cookies , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what a blessing a tractor was , but of how something vital was lost when the mules went . He was a man with a cause , and he talked powerfully of the need to keep the family-type farms . I listened , nodding affirmatively . But I could not shake off the feeling of shame and responsibility for a situation in which a man and his family ? in the United States ? could not fix the outside of their home as they wanted it , could not live as simply and freely as any other persons . It was wrong , terribly wrong . The injustice of it was unspoken , but it was heavy in the room , and though neither of us spoke of it , there was communication between us . They knew that I knew . He took me into town to the hot sultry little hotel where the small coffee shop was air-conditioned but the rooms were not . A fan buzzed from a table in my room . Sleep was slow in coming . Memory went over and over again the agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehension that came over me as we stepped into the room . I long had known that we did not have a free and ordered society in America . It was obvious in the cities , where we discussed the Southerner 's substitution of humanitarian philanthropy and paternalism for the deeper values of human life and an ordered society . In the Southern cities there was no first-class restaurant to which the Negro doctor of philosophy could take his wife and family if they wanted to eat out . If he wanted to take his family to a movie , it was necessary to go to a side entrance and climb up a flight or so of stairs to a gallery . If he rode the city buses , he and his children went to the rear . In most towns , if he took a taxi , it had to be one for Negroes only . The schools were not equal . All this , too , was wrong . When I was with Negro faculty members at universities or professional or business men in the cities , we discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why this was so and why it would have to end . But somehow it had never hit me like a blow until that hot afternoon in a rural county when the county agent had brought me to his home . I think it was because when we talked in study groups or at teas or dinners at the universities or at some homes , we never felt alone . In the hot hotel room that night I could picture the agent and his wife sitting at home talking about the day , their son in the army of his country , and the visits we had made to the farms . They were alone . There were no neighbors . They were vulnerable ? there in the secret tastefulness of their own house . For them , more than anyone in the town , the routine of their lives depended on maintaining a careful balance of things never said , but known . Hitler 's voice could be heard in those days on American short-wave radios . The South was interventionist-minded . There was talk everywhere of freedom and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning with the white county agent with whom I was to be that day , he talked mostly of letters from the Department of Agriculture asking that farmers be encouraged to produce more food . He was planning a big meeting at the schoolhouse . " Will the Negro farmers be there ? " " Oh , no , " he said , " they 'll get the word from their agent ? the one you were with yesterday . " There was no guile in him . The talk of American democracy and the dignity of man did not have a crack in it insofar as he was concerned . And he was not a bad man . The war came on with a rush , and many times in those years I thought back to that late afternoon when we returned , sweaty and tired , to the Negro agent 's house on a farm-to-market road out from the county seat of a town which had known the glories of the days when cotton was king and the South had a monopoly ? " Ours and our sons ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1943 I saw young Southerners in the compelling classrooms of the war . Those I saw were for the most part aviators , fighter pilots , and bomber crews at the bases scattered over the British Isles . Public information officers always brought forth , as a sort of captive audience , the men from a visiting correspondent 's home state . I met many Georgians , and through them other Southerners . We talked of the South , of course , of how we loved it , and of how it must learn to be a part of the nation and not withdrawn . We laughed at the folkway posturing of our politicians and wondered why we all had a not quite understood affection for the most gifted and worst of them . Service in the Second World War opened the eyes and minds of thousands of Southerners . But , truth to tell , we were all so lifted up by the daily challenge of war that we talked mostly of it . It was to be somewhat different two years later . On January 10 , 1945 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Herald Tribune , Carl Ackerman , then dean of Columbia University 's School of Journalism , and I were sent out from New York on a journey which was to take us around the world . We represented the American Society of Newspaper Editors in a sort of Johnny Appleseed mission of trying to organize and interest journalists in being prepared to demand and participate in a freer flow of news and an exchange of news ideas and problems once the war ended and the world was put together again . We traveled in planes of the Air Transport Command , without priority . ( It was offered , but we refused . ) The way led us to London , where the V-2 bombs were coming ; to Paris , newly liberated ; Rome , with fighting in the north ; Athens , with the Communist-directed ELAS troops a few miles away ; to Cairo ; to Ankara and Istanbul ; to Moscow , where there were rockets and gun salutes each night to the victorious push against the Germans ; to Karachi and New Delhi ; to Chiang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via Ceylon ; and then on to San Francisco , where , in the hopeful sun of a beautiful April , the delegates were gathering to write a charter for the United Nations . THE journey was a magnificent panorama . We talked with generals and heads of governments , with soldiers of all nations , with newspapermen and government press officers , with princes and queens in exile . We saw American soldiers under many conditions . It was a thought-provoking trip . There were prophetic stirrings . None who saw the world in the last months of that earth-girdling war could fail to sense that the forces unloosed by it would not die out with the fighting . There would be a new environment requiring new responses . Yet it was not a journey without humor . Forrest and Ackerman , not quite comprehending that in the more provincial journalism of the South a byline that had been appearing in the Atlanta Constitution for sixteen years would have become known to a great many Georgians and Southerners , early began to note how many of them sought me out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in whatever theater we were , gave notice of our presence . And , truthfully , there was a run of Georgians . On the way over we were delayed at Stephenville , Newfoundland , before testing the Atlantic . The duty officer , a Georgian , seeing our names on the manifest , became our guide . He took us to one of the Air Force 's ubiquitous DeGink hotels and warmed us with hospitality and Scotch until departure time . We landed at Prestwick , Scotland . As we changed money at the army finance office , the corporal said he had met me at Rigg Ware 's home in Hogansville , Georgia , and we chatted about him , a mighty fox hunter . In London and Paris other homesick Georgians came around to ask about home . Crawford Ware , a nephew of Rigg Ware , was one . Forrest began to complain that the flood of visitors was , of course , rigged . On the way out to Versailles to see General Eisenhower , he said to Ackerman , " Well , Carl , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connections . " When we had completed a very helpful briefing with the general , I told him I had seen his son John about ten days before . He was coming up to Atlanta from Fort Benning for weekend liberty and was having dates with the attractive daughter of one of my neighbors . The general was delighted to have news of him , and showed us a cutting from a Columbus , Georgia , newspaper in which there was a picture of the young ladies who had attended a dance there , and asked me to identify his son 's date . This I did , not failing to pass it on to my associates for a look . Rome was next , and there an ATC colonel , a Medical Corps major ( both Georgians ) , and a WAC , a member of the Atlanta Constitution staff , then on the Stars and Stripes , came to call . On our drive to the Vatican , accompanied by the late Myron Taylor , U.S. representative to the Holy See , Forrest told the story of the Georgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But one thing is sure . The Holy Father has n't got a son who has dates with the daughter of one of McGill 's neighbors . " Pope Pius XII received us at the appointed time , and as I was presented , he said , ' Mr. McGill , we have had a nice letter about you from Bishop O'Hara in Atlanta . " This was so unexpected that it was with the greatest of difficulty that Forrest and I kept straight faces . The audience was a most pleasant one . For a half hour the Holy Father asked quesdons and answered ours . Before we left , he blessed us each and prayed for a safe journey . ( No three Protestants ever felt more reassured by a prayer than by this one , and the rest of our journey , especially one night out of Abadan when the controls on our DC-4 stuck , we leaned on it mightily . ) Georgia 's triumph was complete when , on quitting Pope Pius ' chambers , we were met by two young priests from Atlanta , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to dinner . In talks with Georgians and Southerners from neighboring states , one of the most common statements was , " The world wo n't ever be the same again , will it ? " Those whom I met in Teheran , in China , and India were , like all other men who served there , shocked by the poverty and misery of the people . Scraps of conversations and conclusions have stayed in my mind . The meetings were brief ? an hour or so ? and most of the talk was of home and the progress of war . But the better-educated Southerners , white and Negro , knew that never again would there be a slipping back into the old restraints and an acceptance of the cynical fiction of the " separate but equal " status . They had been shaken out of any isolationist ideas they may have had . And if some of them would return to and re-embrace parochialism and the old ways , they would never again feel comfortable in them . ONCE the war was ended , it seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine years before the U.S. Supreme Court decision on school desegregation was to be handed down . Nor were those years empty of action . The late forties produced President Truman 's civil rights committee . In 1947 it flatly recommended " the elimination of segregation , based on race , color , creed , or national origin , from American life . " The Congress evaded action on recommended legislation . But in the humid summer of 1948 , in the oppressive non-air-conditioned climate of Philadelphia 's convention hall , Minnesota 's young Senator Hubert Humphrey smashed through the hypocrisy of double-talk with a demand for an honest civil rights plank in the Democratic Party platforni . It was like flashes of lightning in one of those sudden heat storms . The committee compromise plank was cast aside . The substitute called for an end to discriminatory segregation practices . I will always remember Senator Humphrey , how he looked and sounded , and the roar of the crowd . Most of Alabama 's delegation quit the floor , followed by the more angry delegates of other Deep South states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at heart , the most infamously hypocritical and intellectually dishonest political organization ever created . While it sought to conceal its real motives with the cynical old shibboleth of states ' rights , its real principles were those later espoused and practiced by the worst of the White Citizens Councils . Indeed , many of the Dixiecrat leaders became the chief organizers and supporters of these Councils . In 1953 school segregation was ended in all schools operated by the Defense Department , many of them in the several Southern states . The courts also were interpreting the " separate but equal " phrase in the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson case . The rights created by the Fourteenth Amendment required equalization , and there had been none . In 1952 five cases were brought before the Supreme Court challenging the Plessy doctrine . It was obvious , too , that the old tradition of noblesse oblige was fading fast . There had never been much of nobility in it . It was paternalistic , and , with some few exceptions , the Negro was quite right to reject it because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrations one merchant who had provided a basement lunch counter for Negroes said , with honest indignation , " I do n't see how they could do this to us after all we 've done for them . " ) That the school decision of May , 1954 , came as a surprise to many Southerners , evoking furious protests and shameful slanders on a unanimous court , indicated how deeply convinced many persons were that the Negro was not a citizen , and even if he were , he should n't be . Since 1945 there had been yearly reminders that the United States could no longer ignore its own principles , its fourteenth constitutional amendment , and the demands of civilization and morality . The decision was , all in one , fulcrum and lever . Customs , traditions , and political structures began to find themselves moved out of the way . In all America no one was so lucky as the Southerner who was a part of this social revolution , of this determination to reaffirm the principles of what we have called the American dream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
