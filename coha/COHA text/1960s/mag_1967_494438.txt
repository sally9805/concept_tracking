that ? of all things in zoth-century America ? they should try to register as voters . The heart of this book tells what happened to the activists and leaders , to the masses of Negro people , to this nation . The authors are Georgians , and in the period covered by the book ( 1961 to 1965 , when a voting rights bill was finally passed ) they both worked in Atlanta as reporters . Their story opens with a haunting description of a meet ? ing in Terrell County , Georgia . The year is 1962 , and Pat Watters was there . Charles Sherrod led the men and women in prayer . They were assembled in a Baptist church and a painting of Jesus hung over the pulpit . On another wall a picture of President Kennedy was prominently displayed . I suppose Sherrod could be called a " youth , " a " civil rights worker . " He was also a minister , and those were the days when the most " radical " of Negro and white students still quoted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will be against us ? " Sherrod asked and in ? toned in prayer . The sheriff was there , ready and willing to answer the ques ? tion . They sang and they sang : " Voices that were weak at first gained strength as they moved up the scale with the old , familiar words : We are climbing Jacob 's Ladder / Every round goes higher , higher / We are climbing Jacob 's Ladder . Sherrod spoke again , softly , almost singing the words . ' All we want our white brothers to under ? stand is that Thou who made us , made us all . ' Another voice spoke : ' Everybody is welcome . This is a voter registration meeting . ' . . . " A few nights later that church , the Mount Olive Baptist Church , and two others nearby were burned to the ground . Presumably the pictures of both Jesus Christ and an American President were burned to ashes . The authors remind us of much more than the events that took plaCe in South ? western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political life in the 19th and early zoth cen ? turies . They offer a detailed and fair account of the " movement " ? its fore ? runners , its uncertain beginnings , its gradual rise to a position of real signifi DECEMBER 16 , 1967 cance . They describe the old Negro leadership , in cities like Atlanta and in rural areas . Then comes the cli ? max , like Act III in one of Shake ? speare 's plays : " The Struggle ? Fear and Apathy , " followed by " The Struggle ? Jacob 's Ladder , " and then " Field Report ? Telling It Like It Was . " Those one hundred pages document some of the most stirring and heartbreaking mo ? ments in American history . One " field report " follows another ? from John O'Neal , from Bob Moses , from Frank Smith , from Jack Chatfield , from Regi ? nald Robinson , from Elizabeth Wyckoff and Prathia Hall . Those of us who lived in the South then , and in one way or another worked beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to deal with long stretches of Climbing Jacob 's Ladder . I felt in myself a curious mixture of sorrow , indignation ? and yes , nostal ? gia , because those were days of hope and trust . They were days of action , too . The Voter Education Project of the South ? ern Regional Council was set up by foundations with the " advice and con ? sent " of the Kennedy Administration . The purpose was simple : Find out why thousands and thousands of American citizens are afraid to register to vote , and " educate " them to be ? well , what politicians call " loyal and responsible citizens . " I fear no one was fooled . Southern politicians , like all politicians , know when patriotic or " high-minded " talk ends and a threat to the " realities " of our social system begins . A public official in Louisiana put it all very di ? rectly to me a few years back : " Why are they quoting all that Constitution stuff , and the Declaration of Indepen ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , and how we 're go ? ing to keep it that way ? And if it takes a few bullets , I think that will happen , too . " He and his kind did fire bullets . They used bombs and they burnt buildings down to the ground . They terrorized and continue to terrorize thousands of American citizens . The Voter Educa ? tion Project was in fact an attempt to get those American citizens the vote without the help of new federal laws ; and it both succeeded and failed . In some areas voters were enrolled ; in
