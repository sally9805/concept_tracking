The law 's most serious slowdown is not always delay in the courts- the months or years it can take a case to come to trial . Too often the problem is delay in the law 's enforcement-the interminable minutes it can take to reach the police . In an age of computers and digit dialing , it may be easier to phone " Hiya " to a pal in Addis Ababa than to call " Help " to a cop a few blocks away . <P> The citizen who has just been mugged on Staten Island in New York City is likely to get a second unpleasant surprise . If he still has a dime and dials the officially listed police number , ST ( for Saint George ) 7-1200 , he will get a business firm in Manhattan . The cops ' correct number happens to be SA ( for Saint George ) 7-1200 , but someone goofed when it came to listing it in the police roster . Manhattanites are told to call SPring 7-3100 , which is hard enough to remember and even harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrive , apologetic cops often advise , " Next time , call CAnal 7-2000 , " which is not the emergency number but the more prosaic listing for " all other business . " <P> Two-Hour Delay . Typifying the U.S. problem of slow police service , New York City has five boroughs with five separate police numbers that seem to endlessly confuse callers . The police department is now struggling to devise a system whereby a single " hot line " central number would automatically summon the cops in the caller 's own borough-though even this would not eliminate delays caused by police operators who ask interminable questions before sending aid . <P> Even so , New York is better off than many other cities . Houston 's emergency calls go through an all-service city switchboard , and police may be delayed by as much as two hours . In Los Angeles County 's 75 incorporated cities , 27 of them policed by the county sheriff and 48 by local forces , the right number to call is often a mystery to the householder with a prowler hacking at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pray that she is not already swamped with other calls . <P> Two-Minute Rescue . Some cities are making progress . Chicago police have their own switchboard ( POlice 5-1313 ) and a communications center where three-man teams are responsible for each of the city 's eight zones . Calls automatically go to the right team , seated before illuminated zone maps that pinpoint the position of all radio cars . Two men receive and record the details on IBM cards ; the third simultaneously assigns a car . The whole process takes about 15 seconds . <P> Hot-line numbers are on the increase - for example , Boston 's DE 8-1212 , Cleveland 's MA 1-1234 , St. Louis ' CE 1-1212 ; in some cases they bring police cars screeching to the scene in as little as two minutes . Things would be even simpler if U.S. police had a nationwide number like West Germany 's 110 or Britain 's 999 , which can be dialed unerringly in the dark .                    @
