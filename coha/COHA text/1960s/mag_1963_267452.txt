TRACK &; FIELD <P> If it had not been for a castoff television aerial , John Pennel , 23 , might be a ditchdigger today . He used to dig holes for fun on his father 's farm in Tennessee . " I left holes all over the farm , " he says . " I do n't know why I did it . I just had this urge . " Then he found an old roof top TV aerial and , using it as a sort of vaulting pole , began to go up instead of down . One leap led to another , and in 1959 he went to Northeast Louisiana State College on a pole-vaulting scholarship ( room , board , tuition , $20 a month for " laundry " ) . <P> The next good thing that happened to Pennel was that he broke his favorite fiber glass pole during practice last March . At that point , he was an unknown ; the highest he had ever vaulted was a middling 15 ft. 9 in . But on March 23 , using a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rival vaulter ( Rice University 's Fred Hansen ) , Pennel soared 16 ft. 3 in. and broke the world record . He is still using that pole . Last week , at the U.S. v. Great Britain track meet in London , Pennel cleared the crossbar at 16 ft. 10 in. , bettering his own most recent world record of 16 ft. 8 in. , set ten days earlier . <P> A practitioner of the hold-on-for-dear-life , catapult-like technique of vaulting with fiber glass , Pennel used a long , 154-ft. approach " for speed , " a high grip on the pole " for a bigger bend . " He is aiming now for a 17-ft. vault and a gold medal in the 1964 Olympics . " I do n't want to sound overconfident , " he says , " but I think 17 ft. is within my reach . " One little difficulty may interfere : after last week 's meet Pennel noticed a crack in his borrowed pole . " I 'm not going to worry , " he shrugs . " I 'll just keep jumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
