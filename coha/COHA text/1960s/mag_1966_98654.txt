One of these years St. Louis will confound its friends , who have choked so often on fond predictions , with a season of consistent , injury-free football and will win in the East . Few teams in history have looked as strong on paper or as erratic on the field as the Cards of 1963 ( finishing third ) , 1964 ( second ) and 1965 ( tied for fifth ) . Coach Wally Lemm has returned to the Houston Oilers , leaving the mysteries he was unable to solve to Charley Winner , who had earned respect as the Colts ' defensive coach . Winner is willing to spend 12 months a year coaching the Cardinals ( Lemm would coach only on a part-time , six-month basis ) and , unlike his father-in-law , Weeb Ewbank , coach of the Jets , he is cautious about his public statements . " We are not going to talk championship this year , " he says . That is prudent enough for a man with so many puzzles . // Mystery No. 1 for Winner is whether Charley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of great promise with an occasional hot afternoon . Johnson was healthy and St. Louis was 4-1 last year when the young quarterback suffered a collarbone separation . Then the Cardinals went into a steep decline , winning only one of the next nine games , although Johnson was able to play half the time . With a corrective operation behind him , Johnson is fit again and intent on proving he has reached that plateau of maturity on which the Unitases and Starrs operate . However , skeptical fans still wonder whether he can curb his tendencies to become overdependent on two or three pass patterns , to play it cautious when a more natural freewheeling strategy is indicated and to have the big pass intercepted . He has had the Cardinal quarterback job for three and a half years and should be just about as mature this year as he is ever going to be . Substitute Terry Nofsinger is an even darker mystery , having spent five years sitting inactive on the bench . // As usual , the rest of the Cardinal offense seems strong . Flanker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ninth among the league 's receivers last year . They are an outstanding pair , well complemented at tight end by the experienced Jackie Smith . Swift little Billy Gambrell is another good wide receiver . Again the running game has quality and depth in Bill Triplett , Willis Crenshaw , Prentice Gautt and Thunder Thornton  --  although none of these men have proved to be as valuable in a pinch as John David Crow , who was traded to San Francisco a year ago . Again the offensive line boasts such large and capable performers as Tackles Bob Reynolds and Ernie McMillan , Guards Irv Goode and Ken Gray and Center Bob DeMarco . Reynolds and McMillan are especially proficient at pass protection . Gray , an All-League choice , has the speed to lead wide plays and the strength ( he weighs 250 ) to execute any kind of interior blocking assignment . Goode is close to Gray 's level , lacking only his experience . DeMarco is an ideal center . He is strong enough to handle choke and angle blocks and quick enough for cutoff blocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and extra points with exceptional accuracy . He has booted 117 consecutive points and last year made good on two of every three of his field-goal attempts . // The defensive lineup is also impressive to read about , but like the offense it can be very , very good at times and horrid at others . In the front four there is a large hole to be filled at right tackle . Luke Owens , the senior defensive lineman , is finished because of a heart problem . His replacement appears to be Chuck Walker . Otherwise the line is intact . Ends Joe Robb and Don Brumm are among the best pass rushers in the league . Tackle Sam Silas is quick on the rush , too , although he can be trapped . Except for Brumm , a sharp , wary campaigner , this unit is extremely aggressive  --  sometimes to the point of recklessness . Linebackers Larry Stallings , Dale Meinert and Bill Koman have better than average speed and size . The corner men , Stallings and Koman , are demon blitzers . Meinert is somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of courage . St. Louis needs injury insurance here in the way of competent replacements not yet visible . // Reading the individual qualifications of the men in the secondary makes you wonder how anyone can pile up passing yardage on them  --  as a couple of opponents invariably do . These backs lack neither ability nor desire . Against Pittsburgh , for example , Safety Larry Wilson , with broken bones in both hands , intercepted a pass that set up the first of three Cardinal touchdowns . Pat Fischer , Jerry Stovall , Monk Bailey , Abe Woodson and Jimmy Burson allegedly could start for anyone , and Coach Winner 's problem is picking the first four . // Such promising rookies as Running Backs Johnny Roland and Roy Shivers and Defensive Back Jimmy Heidel missed training time because of the All-Star Game ( although Roland on the day afterward returned a kickoff 58 yards against Atlanta in a preseason game ) , and it is unlikely that they will make the starting lineups. // Moving into the new Busch Memorial Stadium under a new coach as the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere from first to fifth . Fourth should be about right .
