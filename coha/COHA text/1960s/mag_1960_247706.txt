Khrushchev 's ranting belligerence had rallied the Western nations closer together , and at home , even amid election-year recriminations , a heightened sense of national unity was evident . <P> " What about the future ? " asked President Eisenhower in his televised report to the nation . Widespread in the U.S. was a sense of a future , a sense of changes astir . Just beyond the threshold of a new decade , the nation looked ahead to a presidential election .

Many have called for such a definition-and there are unquestionably many to be framed , as many as the multiple tasks that face the world . Last week the President of the U.S. provided one definition that would merit thought . " A major American goal , " he said , " is a world of open societies " ( see box , next page ) . That meant a world of open frontiers , open skies , free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any nation-even for the U.S.
