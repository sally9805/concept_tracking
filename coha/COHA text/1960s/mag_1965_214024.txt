Everything of consequence in South Viet Nam was up in the air . Out of Danang Airbase roared flight after flight of bomb-laden U.S. jets to strike at the increasingly aggressive Communist Viet Cong in the country 's besieged northern reaches . Out of Saigon 's airport far to the south soared Lieut . General Nguyen Khanh , bound for exile with his family , carrying two plastic bags full of Vietnamese earth , the Grand Cross of the National Order , and the ruins of a year in power . <P> Street Without Joy . The U.S. jet flights from Danang marked a break with earlier U.S. practice , in which American flyers and gunners served merely as " advisers " to the South Vietnamese military . For the first time , Americans were flying and fighting on their own , and , as one U.S. navigator-bombardier said , " now we 've shown them what we can do . " <P> It may not be enough just yet , but it was a considerable improvement . In eight strikes last week , U.S. F-100 Super Sabres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving scores of guerrillas dead in their wakes . The planes dropped tons of newly developed anti-personnel bombs , including an aerial version of the artilleryman 's cannister : a big bomb casing that opens after release to pour out a string of smaller bombs on a 100-ft. line . <P> Increased U.S. participation was in order , for the Viet Cong last week threatened to cut South Viet Nam in half ( see map ) . Operating in battalion-strength units , the Communists hacked away at two important highways : Route 1 , the embattled north-south road that the French called La Rue sans Joie ( Street Without Joy ) , and Route 19 , which links Pleiku in the central plateau with the seaport staging base of Quinhon . Controlling all of Route 19 from Pleiku to within 20 miles of Quinhon , the Viet Cong pinned down a company of South Vietnamese Rangers and U.S. Special Forces advisers at Mangyang Pass . The Rangers were rescued by helicopter only after two U.S. jet strikes had scraped the Communist attackers off the surrounding cliffs . <P> Hardware in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. jets , things looked grim in the six northernmost provinces . Steady infiltration from North Viet Nam ( see following story ) gave the Viet Cong parity in both arms and men with the government 's 20,000-man I Corps . <P> At week 's end , the government prepared for a three-pronged offensive aimed at clearing Route 19 . Unless the road is regained , the entire central highlands could fall to the Viet Cong , leaving only thin strips of government control through the northern half of the country . To relieve some of the pressure , South Korea last week sent the first 600 troops of a 2,000-man engineer contingent to rebuild bridges in central Viet Nam . <P> At the same time , other U.S. jets and Skyraider attack bombers flew 47 sorties from Bienhoa Airbase near Saigon , hitting hard with bombs and rockets at units of Viet Cong in the jungles east of the capital . With all the U.S. hardware in the sky , the Viet Cong began lying low for the moment .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
