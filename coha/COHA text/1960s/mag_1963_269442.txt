Of course , he got 90 minutes of free , prime time on TV , and was able to meet the folks in the Kremlin 's mighty marble Palace of the Congresses . Otherwise , Nikita Khrushchev 's stump speech to his constituents from Moscow 's Kalinin district sounded as if he had to run for dear life to get re-elected to the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Republic this week . <P> Naturally , Nikita claimed success for his own foreign policy . The Communists were winning the cold war . and all that talk about trouble with the Chinese was an " illusion . " ( Same day , Peking launched a new attack on Moscow 's " fierce visage but faint heart . " ) Then , in his folksiest manner . Khrushchev told the people just how plumb lucky they were to be in Russia and not in the U.S. , where elections are actually contested . <P> " Sort of a show takes place , " he said . " Marchers demand votes for the elephant while the other party canvasses votes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two animals is cleverer . Political advertising in the U.S. has much the quality of consumer advertising ; it is rather loud , even showy , I would say . All sorts of promises are made , of mountains of gold and rivers of milk . " Describing a typical U.S. campaign speech , Nikita said that one candidate promised his constituents to " build a new bridge for you " if elected . " ' But we have n't got a river , so what do we need a bridge for ? ' asked the puzzled voters . ' Never mind , ' replied the candidate . ' We 'll make a river for you too . ' " <P> No slouch himself when it comes to campaign promises , Khrushchev told the folks that " probably each one of you would like to have a far better suit or dress to wear . " Well , said he , " the time will come " when every Soviet citizen will actually have three suits of clothes-one , presumably , for his birthday , one for his wedding and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artful Nikita , " if I were to promise you that you 'll have three new suits next year , you 'd say that I was drunk . " To stormy applause , the old pro sat down . In Kalinin , he would probably be the people 's choice even if they had one .
