Early this month , 50,000 German university students marched out of their classrooms for day-long demonstrations along the streets of 120 cities and towns . The picket lines had nothing to do with banning the bomb or demanding free speech . Carrying such signs as WHERE IS OUR FAMOUS GERMAN EDUCATION NOW ? , the students were protesting the decline and fall of a school system that once was as synonymous with excellence as Swiss watches are in timekeeping . One newspaper called the demonstrations , designed to prod West Germany 's two major political parties into pledging their support for better education , " the greatest student initiative since the revolution of 1848 . " <P> Basically unchanged since the turn of the century , chronically short-funded , West Germany 's educational system is in serious trouble . In a booming economy , the percentage of the gross national product spent on education last year was a low 3.5% . Thousands of farm children still attend classes in old-fashioned one-room schoolhouses ; many high schools have neither laboratories nor libraries . <P> System Strangled . A growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War II took away many of the young men who would normally have turned to the classrooms . When teachers now in their 50s and 60s begin to retire a decade from now , concludes Philosopher Georg Picht , West Germany will have to persuade 90% of its university graduates to become teachers to fill the gap . <P> Many Germans are now also questioning the basic structure of the system . Like most European countries , Germany separates its young by exam at an early age ( ten ) , sending the brightest through the rigorous , classics-oriented Gymnasium and on to the university ; the rest attend the Mittelschule or the less exacting Volkschule , both roughly equivalent to American junior high schools . Currently , less than 7% of German youths enter the Gymnasium ; in France , by comparison , almost 13% attend the equivalent lyce . Many wonder whether so small a number of high-level graduates can provide the intellectual skills to keep Germany 's vaunted " economic miracle " on the go . <P> " Monstrous Abuse . " The ruling Christian Democratic Party has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ludwig Erhard angrily dismissed the student demonstrations as a " monstrous abuse . " Still , many Germans were sufficiently shocked out of complacency by the protests to study anew the somber statistics cited by Picht , whose book , The German Educational Catastrophe , set off a national debate last year . " If the government and the state parliaments fail to act now , " he warns , " one can already pinpoint who will be responsible for the third debacle in 20th century German history .
