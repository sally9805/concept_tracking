txt Mayor Lindsay has tightened his control over the city school system by moving to - end the Board of Education 's freedom to allocate school funds without City Hall approvel . The Mayor 's action , which wiped out a budget practice instituted five years ago during the administration of Mayor Robert F. Wagner , was immediately criticized by top school officials . Lloyd K. Garrison , president of the Board of Education , and Dr. Bernard E. Donovan , the Superintendent of Schools , said that Mr. Lindsay 's move to replace the board 's " lump sum " budget with a " line-by-line " budget would hamper the flexibility of the board 's operations . The Public Education Association , an influential citizens ' group , charged that the Mayor 's action " is a dismal climax to a series of moves to downgrade the New York City Board of Education . " Shifting Funds Was Issue Under a lump-sum appropriation , the board had power to shift funds within ' its budget without first getting the approval of city authorities . A line-by-line budget gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be allocated . Under the Mayor 's plan , for example , if the school board wanted to shift money from repairs to hiring more teachers it would have to get City Hall 's approval . The change in fiscal procedure became known on the eve of the submission of the Mayor 's expense budget for 1967-68 to the Board of Estimate and the City Council . The Board of Estimate and City Council have the power to alter the budget as they see fit . The Mayor may veto changes , but the Board and Council , acting together , can override vetoes. $5.2-Billion Budget The executive budget , which will be made public today , is expected to total about $5.2-billion , the largest in the city 's history . The proposed budget will include $103.2-million to provide new or expanded services in many city departments . As a result of these funds , New Yorkers can expect to see more meter maids checking parking meters , more gutters handswept by sanitation men and a more intensive pursuit of traffic offenders who scoff at their fines . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is $87-million more than it received this year but about $73-million less than it had requested for the new fiscal year starting July 1 . School officials said that the $87-million raise would be absorbed largely by increased mandatory costs  --  such as pen ' sion and transportation expenses and the need to hire additional teachers to handle an expected rise in enrollment " There Is no money in this budget for any improvement of educational services , " Mr. Donovan declared . " This means that we do not have the money to intensify our early childhood education program , reduce class size , improve our materials of instruction , effectively care for the in-service training of the staff or to adequately meet our maintenance problems . " If any of these " urgent needs " are to be met , Mr. Garrison said , other school services will have to be " sacrificed . " But he added that the task of " recasting " the budget would be made more difficult by the imposition of a. line-by-line budget . " Lump sum budgets , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one function to another with relative flexibility and expedition . In the past , such shifting of funds under the line-by-line budget was a time-consuming process , both for the board and the budget officials , and we regret the reversion to it . " But the real fear of the lineby-line budget , which school officials appeared reluctant to express yesterday , was that power over the school system 's purse strings  --  deciding , for example , which school programs warranted fiscal support  --  could give the city administration power to determine educational policy . This possibility was pointed up by Dr. Frederick C. , director of the Public Education Association , who urged the Board of Education " to resist every attempt to substitute political guesswork for educational judgment in the formulation of policy for the public schools . " Dr. also asserted that Mayor Lindsay 's action in changing the budget procedure was based " on the mistaken assumption that the public school system is a department of city government . " The civic leader said that the courts have repeatedly held that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This was an apparent rebuttal to a statement made earlier in the day by an aide to Mr. Lindsay who indicated that the Mayor felt that the Board of Education should be treated the same as other city depart . ments and like them should be on a line-by-line budget . " The Mayor feels that as the city 's chief elected official , he should be more intimately involved in the educational process and its financing , " he declared . The aide spoke to newsmen on condition that he was not to be identified . Little City Halls Mr. Lindsay was asked about the change at a news confer . ence at City Hall . " The only comment I would make at this time , " he said , " is that we of the city , which has the obligation of funding to the extent of almost 100 per cent believe that we should have a better idea of how the money is being spent . . . " According to informatior from the Board of Education the city actually contributed 60.8 per cent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent and the remainder came from the Federal Government . The change to a lump-sum budget , which had long been sought by school officials , occurred in 1962 as the result of a local law passed by the . City Council . In 1963 , Mayor Wagner signed a memorandum of agreement with school officials spelling out and widening the board 's fiscal freedom . Mr. Wagner , asked for com ment last night on the return , to a line-by-line budget , said ' the change could inject politics into education . " Politics do not belong in education and Lindsay 's new theory can be dangerous , " the former Mayor said . During his 151/ months in office , Mr. Lindsay has on several occasions sharply criticized the Board of Education and indicated that he intended to play a more active role than his predecessor , Mr. Wagner , in city school affairs . A year ago , he shocked school officials by asserting at a meeting of the Public Education Association that the city was not getting a full return on its expenditures for education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " performance " school budget . Last fall , during a controversy over Intermediate School 201 in East Harlem , he accused the Board of Education of " clumsy " handling of the dispute with Negro parents and charged that the board had isolated itself from the public . The board accused him of intrusion but Mr. Lindsay said he would not , in the future , stay out of school controversies . Several other items in the Mayor 's budget also became known yesterday . The Mayor put $3.5-million of the new funds in the next budget into the Model Cities Program . This is money he hopes to get from Congress . The Model Cities Program is designed to rehabilitate , both physically and sociologically , some of the city 's worst slum areas in Harlem , the South Bronx and Brooklyn . In his capital budget , already adopted , the Mayor appropriated $15-million of the city 's money for this program . The " improvements " money in. the next budget will in elude $200,000 for five addition-1 al Little City Halls in city neighborhoods . Earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this program in this year 's budget . The Council contended that Little City Halls were not needed and would only serve as political clubhouses for the Mayor . Mr. Lindsay has already established three of them with funds from his office budget . Mr. Lindsay has ear-marked $900,000 for the purchase of books for libraries and for additions to library staffs . He is setting aside another $450,000 for the special work forces that have been sprucing up city parks . And there will be an increase of $6-million in funds for the treatment of narcotics .
