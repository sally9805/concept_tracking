" The world is too much with us , " wrote William Wordsworth in a famous sonnet , and Russell Baker echoes the poet three times a week in the New York Times . A funny place to do it , in a paper full of world news . But to Humorist Baker , 42 , even a fraction of all the news that 's fit to print is far too much . " The law of life , " he writes , " is that there is almost always less happening than meets the eye . " <P> What met his eye last week was not a paucity of happenings but 1967 's " ten grossest excesses . " It was a brilliant , unpartisan , vindictive selection . Charles de Gaulle was there , of course , along with Mao and his Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution . The 1967 football season , hanging on " like a summer cold , " qualified . So did Jacqueline Kennedy magazine covers and the movie Casino Royale , " the utter boring vacuity of the put-on carried to excess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Marshall McLuhan 's " losing battle with the English language , " and The Story of O , " unarguably the dullest dirty book ever written . " * Finally , there were all the " Ins " ( the bein , the kissin , the wedin , the dance-in , the shop-in , the drinkin , the love-in , the sing-in ) , and-with unerring glee-the moaning over the Generation Gap . <P> Strike for Sanity . Playing the role of a quiet subversive among the hortatory voices of the Times editorial page , Baker mocks " overstates , " the " crisis-glut " and determined problem solvers . " A solved problem creates two new problems , " he writes , " and the best prescription for happy living is not to solve any more problems than you have to . " A sober Washington reporter himself until a sense of futility overcame him , Virginia-born Baker became the Times 's first humor columnist six years ago . He uses humor , he says , " to strike a blow for sanity . " <P> Baker is stationed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After last summer 's riots , he drove straight to the heart of the plot : Rap Brown was actually on the payroll of the Senate Appropriations Committee . Brown 's job : to find " inexpensive solutions to the nation 's racial problems . " When trouble threatens , Rap is rushed to the spot to deliver inflammatory harangues . Then the Senate can blame the riots on " outside agitators " and avoid spending any money on the slums . A year ago , wrote Baker , a theater script had been rejected as too far-out because it had Khrushchev 's nephew defecting to the U.S. and joining the John Birch Society . But life outdid art . " Stalin 's daughter defected to the U.S. and joined Sam Levenson and Elia Kazan in the society of bestsellers. "
