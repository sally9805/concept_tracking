 | Studying the personnel on the list as she slowly left the President 's desk , Edna played her deduction game . One did not have to be Scott of the CIA or Lombardi of the FBI to make an accurate prediction , once one was given a set of clues . Edna made her prediction to herself , enjoying the sport almost as much as she enjoyed the diversion of the crossword puzzles and Double-Crostic games that she hoarded for weekends . The emergency conference call from the President , she told herself , would be devoted almost entirely to Africa and the trouble over the new Republic of Baraza . The presence of the Assistant Secretary for African Affairs indicated this . Then there would he talk about pushing something through a balky Congress , probably the unpopular ratification of the renewal of the United States ' membership in the African Unity Pact , as well as further economic aid to newly independent African nations . The presence of two senators and one representative and one general indicated this . The attendance of Talley and Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were always present when T.C. spoke , always there , his confidants and alter egos . Yes , Edna deckled unhappily , Africa would be the subject , and that promised a dull and wearisome morning . African talk meant almost nothing to her . What was it , really ? A black jumble of crazy names like Basutoland , Nyasaland , Malagasy , Gambia , Dahomey , Chad , Rwanda , and lately , Baraza . Even if you were intelligent , you could not tell one country from another , or one primitive face from another ( despite those wild robes they wore , despite those odd Oxford or Harvard accents they assumed when they called upon the President ) . It was all impossible and , for Edna , Africa remained the Dark Continent , affecting her day-to-day existence in no way whatsoever . And  --  repressed heresy  --  she suspected that those comicopera countries meant little more to T.C. or Talley or Eaton , either . Soviet Russia , now , that was another matter . Russia could blow us up , and ruin everything , everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married and live and have children . She had paused before the French doors leading out to the cement walk with its overhang and colonnades . Outside  --  T.C. called it his " backyard " ? the darkness had gone , and the gray dawn was brightening . Even in late August , the Rose Garden was still in full bloom , the roses and Shasta daisies and geraniums dominated by early chrysanthemums . At the far end of the garden Andrew Jackson 's hoary magnolia tree , partially obscuring the White House rotunda and Truman 's Balcony , was thick with green foliage . For  | a moment Edna was tempted to step outside , join the White House policeman who had appeared on the walk , deeply inhale the cool fresh air , and fully revive herself for the Frankfurt call . But the platinum watch on her left wrist bound her to duty . Swiftly she left the President 's office and returned to her own desk . Yanking open drawers , digging supplies out of them , she was at last occupied with routine and too busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms heavily weighted under a pyramid of memorandum pads , boxes of pencils , shorthand notebook , and spare ashtrays , she went carefully to the door of the Cabinet Room . Balancing her load against the frame of the door , she grasped the knob , turned it , and pushed the door open with her knee . She had somehow expected to find Arthur Eaton inside . He was usually first , seated and hunched over the long eight-sided , coffinlike mahogany table , his chalky , finely chiseled , aristocratic profile bent over sheaves of briefing notes . But he was not there . Instead , across the Cabinet Room , two khaki-clad enlisted men , plainly Signal Corps , were finishing the wiring of two gray metal boxes that rested on the dark table . Edna recognized the larger box , with its perforated side , as the receiver that would unscramble and the loudspeaker that would amplify the President 's confidential conversation from Frankfurt , while the sensitive smaller audio box was the microphone which would pick up any voice in the room , scramble it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gothic study in the Alte Mainzer Palace , where it would be unscrambled and made comprehensible through a similar portable system set up for the listening President . Apparently the two Signal Corps men were too occupied to be aware of Edna 's arrival . She coughed , and called out , " Good morning , gentlemen . " The younger , a technician third class , glanced over his shoulder . " Oh , good morning , ma 'm . We 'll be outa here in a jiffy . " " Go right ahead . We still have fifteen minutes . " Edna lowered her precarious load to the table , then went to the three pairs of green drapes concealing the French doors and opened them , so that once more Jackson 's magnolia tree was in her view and the room behind her filled with the filtered early morning light . After shaking loose the Presidential flag , which now hung well , and taking note of the American flag , which was fine , Edna resumed her familiar routine . She distributed memorandum pads , pencils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hardly aware  | that the Signal Corps men were making tests , and then saying good-bye . She was not yet through when the corridor door opened . Startled , Edna wheeled , expecting Eaton , but instead saw two of the Secret Service agents of the White I louse Detail , one the red-faced , beefy Beggs , the other the wiry , blond Sperry . " Got you busy early this morning , hey ? " Beggs called out . " They sure have , " said Edna. ust want to thank you for Ogden and Otis , Miss Foster , " said Beggs . She knew that her face must have reflected blankness , for he quickly added , " ' They 're my boys . " Then he said , " First ones in their school with the new Baraza stamps . We 're all grateful . " " 1 have n't had any more from Africa this week , " said Edna . " Most of the mail is from Frankfurt  --  from Germany  --  by diplomatic pouch , so no stamps . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , Miss Foster . Boys can use those for trading . Sure appreciate your thinking of us . " Beggs 's colleague , Sperry , had touched his arm , and he looked off , then turned back . " Here they come , Miss Foster . Be seeing you . " The moment that the Secret Service agents were gone , Leach came through the open door , nodding his skeletal head , carrying his perpetual harassment and his portable stenotype to the table , two chairs from the center where Eaton would sit . Edna heard more footsteps on the tile corridor floor and waited . The three of them appeared in the doorway at the same time , and then Talley and Stover hung back , deferring to Eaton . The Secretary of State , tall , slender , magnificent in his pin-striped gray Saville Row suit , fedora in his hand , entered briskly . " Hello , Miss Foster , " he said in his deep , well-modulated voice . " Sorry about the hour , but T.C. appears to need our help . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck Edna dumb , and as ever , she could do no more than duck her head and murmur her welcome . She watched Eaton as he deposited his hat on a bench and walked to the chair where Stover had already placed his alligator briefcase . She could see Eaton with the same eyes that the President , an old friend , saw him , and what she saw was an Easterner of excellent antecedents , schooled in the Ivy League traditions , a careful , moderate , thoughtful man , mellowed by the best of taste , and still youthful in late middle age . Where Eaton differed from T.C. was in the matter of human relationship . The President was gayer , warmer , more flamboyant , the politician 's brass  | section accompanying the subtle chamber-music strings . The President would always be elected ; Arthur Eaton would always be appointed . She continued to observe Eaton as he removed clipped papers from his briefcase and sat down with them . He was the most attractive man currently in public office , she was positive . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Edna resented this , for Harding was not patrician and his historical image was weak . Edna had once seen a portrait of James K. Polk , and although she had heard that Polk had been slight and inconspicuous , she knew that this was the man in American history that Eaton most resembled . Like Polk , the Secretary of State possessed a smooth , sleek pompadour , graying above the forehead and at the temples . His eyes were full and deep , his nose slightly Grecian in its line , his jaw ( like his entire face ) bony and long . He was Virginia , Andover , Princeton , and perfect . And now , Edna could see , he had lifted his head from his papers to listen to an exchange between T.C. 's right-hand adviser , Wayne Talley , and Eaton 's own Assistant Secretary for African Affairs , Jed Stover . The short , heavyset , electric Talley was poking a finger into Stover 's shoulder for emphasis . " I do n't care about your damn facts and figures , Jed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you know that . Do you want us to go to war with those Communist apes over some little jungle country not much bigger than a football field ? Do you want to fight over 30,000 square miles in West Africa ? " The taller Jed Stover , squirming at Talley 's poking finger , patted his bristly eyebrows and scrub of mustache , and said calmly , " It is 33,000 square miles , and has a population of 2,437,000 , Wayne . It has gold , a good deal of gold , and diamonds and iron ore . Be-sides ? " " There 's not enough gold in the entire place to pay for what it might cost us in trouble . " Doggedly Stover continued . " Besides , it is our model , in a sense , our creation , our showcase , Wayne . You can not give an emerging black nation democracy , and then turn your back on it . " " We have enough showcases over there . We have Liberia and Ghana and a half-dozen more . That African Unity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paper work , good propaganda . We never intended to renew . Now , just because Baraza is in it , I see no reason  | to change our minds . You people in African Affairs get too involved in your own little world , and you ca n't see it as a small part of a bigger world with bigger problems . You 're like so many whiskercombing scholars , each with one lifetime specialty , and you get to thinking that the truth about Nancy IIanks is more important than the Presidency , or that the significance of democracy in San Marino is more important than Italy . Do n't look so damn hurt , Jed . I 'm not disparaging all the spadework you fellows do , and how well you serve , but vou 're all inclined to suffer from funnel vision . I mean it . ' I'll ( ' President and I have discussed this many times . And I 'm sure Arthur understands this even better than the two of us . " Talley had turned to seek Arthur Eaton 's collaboration . Jed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately subdued by the relerenee to his superior . Ile seemed to bite his tongue and make an eftort to held silent . f  --  aton , ' who had been listening , pursed his lips . He considered the President 's aide . At last he spoke . " Jed and his department are doing an excellent job , Wayne . " " 1 admitted that " interrupted ' Palley . " I was only saying ? " " I heard what you were saying , Wayne , " Eaton went on . " There is much to what you have been saying . You can be sure that T.C. and I are perfectly aware of what is going on and what must be done . " Witnessing the verbal scuffle , Edna Foster saw that this time it was Wayne Talley 's turn to be cowed . Eaton had made it clear that he and T.C. would make the final decisions on African intervention . He had , in a refined way , reminded Talley that although he was the President 's aide , he was not his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only his sounding board and runner . He had put Talley in his place , which was not between the President and the Secretary of State , but somewhere behind them , outside them . But it had been carefully done , so that ' Palley would not lose face before a lesser State Department appointee . Edna noted that Governor Talley reacted to the encounter , and subtle rebuff , as he always had in the past . His right eye , the one that was slightly crossed , involuntarily began to twitch . His bulbous nose reddened . He seemed less sure of the checkered suit and blue shirt and gaudy gold-coin tie clasp he was given to wearing . He appeared , Edna thought , like the officious manager of a Midwest haberdashery , who had just been reminded by the wealthy absentee owner that he had once been a humble clerk .  | " Of course , " Eaton was saying now , with a serious smile , " we are dealing with yesterday 's facts , are we not ? What I know , what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is useful , as of this minute , but in five minutes the President will be speaking to us from Frankfurt . After another morning with the Russians , he may have new facts , new ideas , and our recipe for a decision on Africa may be considerably changed . Do n't you both agree ? " Edna found that she had to keep herself from smiling at the Secretary of State 's adroitness . He had taken Talley and Stover in as his equals at last , and they were mollified . Talley , grunting and bobbing his head , circled the table to sit beside T.C. 's favorite . Stover , exhaling satisfaction , found a place opposite his superior . ) ( Edna , realizing that Arthur Eaton was waving to someone behind her , turned , and to her surprise all the others were already in the Cabinet Room . Quickly she stepped forward to show Senator Selander and Representative Wickland to their chairs . Senator Dilman had not waited for her , but had gone off to take the place farthest from the Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood by all , Edna knew , just as she herself understood it , that Dilman did not rank with the others , not even with Selander and Wickland . Although Dilman , as President pro tempore of the Senate , had been wielding the gavel since the Vice-President 's death , it was known that he held the position as a political gesture . " Sorry to be the last ! " Edna heard a voice boom out from the door . It was four-star General Pitt Fortney , the rigid , scarred Texan , pulling off his leather gloves . " SAC has been bending my ear from Omaha . It was n't easy to get away . " He handed his trench coat to Edna and strode to the table , pulling out a chair and sitting stiffly in it . He addressed Eaton . " Steiny had me on the phone last night . He thinks Premier Kasatkin means business . Even flew Marshal Borov in from Leningrad . Maybe the President ought to have me over there . " Eaton appeared to look down his nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can represent the Pentagon very well , General . I am sure T.C. feels you are needed here . " Noticing that her platinum wristwatch gave them two minutes to conference time , Edna Foster started around the Cabinet table toward Eaton and the portable loudspeaker . Passing Representative Wickland , she saw him lean across the table and ask Talley , " What 's this about Earl MacPherson flying  | to Frankfurt from Buenos Aires ? He was supposed to be here in Washington today . " " Just a one-day detour , " said Talley . " The President felt you boys in the House could spare your Speaker for one more day . T.C. wanted him on hand . " " On African economic aid legislation ? " " Probably . If T.C. tells you what 's going on , you boys in the House might not listen . If your own Speaker tells you , then you might listen . Mac  --  I'herson'lI I back on the Hill tomorrow . " Edna ha I taken a position behind Eaton , and was about to inform hint that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out shrilly . Instantly the room was hushed . Edna bent between Eaton and Talley , punched down the " On " button ; stop the beige loudspeaker , then she hit the " On " button above the microphone box , turned the volume to " Medium High , " and stepped away . She reached her waiting chair and shorthand pad , beside Leach , as a far-off erratic voice came indistinctly over the loudspeaker , and then suddenly broke out loudly and clearly . " ? calling from Frankfurt am Main , this is Signal Corps Captain Foss calling from Frankfurt am Main . Do we have the White House Washington ? " Calmly Secretary of State Eaton addressed the microphone box . " This is the White House , Captain . This is the Secretary of State . We are assembled and ready for the conference call . " " All right , sir . The President is waiting to speak to you . " A nnclllecl crossing of voices slapped against the loudspeaker , and then a jagged arrow of static , and at once T.C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Cabinet Room . " Arthur , are you there ? " " Everyone is here , Mr. President . How are you ? Is everything going well ? " " Never better , never better . In fact , I just this moment talked Mncl'hc'rsmn into betting all even on Dartmouth against Princeton next ? limit h . I want you to ask Internal Revenue if my winnings are tax-free , since we made the wager in Germany . Remember to do that , Arthur . " Everyone in the Cabinet Room laughed , hoping the laugh would be unscr ; uulhled in Frankfurt , and then settled into silence . ' I ' . C. wits coning through the loudspeaker again . " We broke up at the Roemer before noon . We 're reconvening at two . Our gang  | stayed over there to eat , but a few of us slipped out on the press and the rest of them , and came over here to talk it out in privacy . I 've been sitting in this beat-up old Palace study  --  it 's cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to come along  --  and I 've been conferring with Ambassador Zwinn , and Secretary Steinbrenner , and our obliging Speaker of the House . One second , Arthur ? " There was a long pause , and then T.C. was on once more . " Just said good-bye to the Ambassador  --  he 's heading back to Bonn  --  and to Steiny  --  he 's needed over at the Consulate . Okay , we can settle down now . There are a few problems to contend with , at once . I want to talk this over with you , and then I 'll put MacPherson on , and he can concentrate on Harvey Wickland . Incidentally , Harv , I want to let MacPherson rest here tonight , and you 'll have him back in the Speaker 's chair tomorrow . " There was a pause , and then T.C. resumed through the loudspeaker . " Arthur  --  Wayne  --  all of you there , the problem is Premier Kasatkin . I 'd forgotten what a tough bastard he can be . He seems determined to be difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , and my backside is aching after these last hours . I 'm determined to get out of here in a few days , but I want to get out with the knowledge that I have n't given up New York , Detroit , Los Angeles , Bombay , and Baraza City to the Muscovites for the right to stay in Berlin . " Wayne Talley had leaned across Eaton . " T.C. , " he said into the microphone , " this is Wayne here . Is it that bad ? Does Kasatkin mean it ? " Over the loudspeaker T.C. 's retort was urgent . " Does he mean it ? I 'm not sure . That is what we have to judge . We have to decide how far we can go with blank cartridges . That is why I wanted to consult you before trying to digest my lunch . When I go back in there this afternoon , and sit down across from our Soviet friends , I want to know what ammunition I have or should have . In other words , I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kasatkin and Marshal Borov that we intend to stand firm on Baraza , support its independence , even fight for it , at the same time making it clear that we want to be reasonable and are concerned with more dangerous trouble spots and greater issues abroad . You understand ? " Listening , Presidential aide Wayne Talley displayed his pleasure , and shot a triumphant grin at Assistant Secretary Jed Stover . Arthur Eaton was speaking in the direction of the microphone box . " What are the latest Soviet charges against us , Mr. President ? "  | " On Baraza ? " said T.C. " A whole bill of particulars to prove the United States is becoming an aggressor in Africa , using Baraza merely as a beachhead for our eventual domination of all Africa . They argued that we manipulated Baraza 's independence in return for the promise that they would be pro-democracy and anti-Communist . Premier Kasatkin carried the ball the whole morning . He tried to prove that we did not allow Baraza to hold a fair and open election three months ago . IIc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our puppet , Kwame Amboko , in as President . You know what the Premier 's evidence was ? That one of our old exchange programs financed Amboko 's coining to the United States fifteen years back , and this program financed his brainwashing at Harvard . Hear that , Arthur ? Ilarvard is still giving us Princeton men trouble . " He laughed through a rising wave of static , but it was not a mirthful laugh . Ile went on quickly . " Premier Kasatkin pointed to Baraza 's new anti-Communist legislation , which is being debated in their Parliament . The Premier accused us of being behind it . He raved and ranted that we were bending Amboko 's arm to get the Communist Party outlawed and the cultural exchange program with Moscow stopped . " " What evidence did the Premier present to support that charge ? " Eaton asked . " He had no concrete evidence , " replied T.C. " I could have stayed home and reread your Embassy reports , or the translations from Pravda , and known just as much . Kasatkin argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our government funds , and not from private enterprise , and that we had threatened to cut it off unless Amboko banned the Communist Party and the cultural exchange with Moscow . He said we were afraid of Communism in Africa , because we knew that was what the blacks wanted and needed . He said , Those poor people know Communism gives them bread , while democracy gives them a vote and a Letter to the Editor . ' IIe 's a real smart aleck , in a sort of knlak way , and absolutely distrustful of everyone . IIe said not only was our money leading Amboko by the nose , but that we were also using our renewal of the African Unity Pact as a bribe . It all comes down to this  --  the Soviets are charging us with using Baraza as a launching pad to wipe native Communism out of Africa , so we can exploit the black population , control Baraza 's gold and iron ore . That 's the picture , my friends . It may look abstract , but it is realism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are perfectly right , Mr. President , " Eaton was saying , " we have heard most of that before . The question is  --  what do the Russians specifically want of us ? After all , they instigated this Frankfurt conference to iron out differences . What are they suggesting ? " T.C. snorted , and the loudspeaker sent the sound splitting across the Cabinet Room like a handclap . " What are they suggesting ? Good God , Arthur , they are demanding . Yes , they are demanding that we do one of two things  --  you see , they say they are being reasonable , ready for compromise  --  that we do one of two things , either kill the African Unity Pact  --  the AUP  --  kill it in the Senate , withdraw from it  --  or that we use our influence , show our good intentions in Africa , by getting Baraza to drop legislation against the native Communist Party and the cultural exchange program with Moscow . There it is . " " Why this sudden strenuous objection to AUP ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we first went into it . " " Because , according to Kasatkin , when we first went into it , the Soviets regarded it as a weak paper pact , limited to three countries and promising only small economic assistance . But they consider the new AUP as a threat . They point out it involves five African nations , and guarantees our military intervention to protect those countries from aggression . The Soviets argue we 're setting up a Monroe Doctrine in Africa . They wo n't sit still for another NATO ? a fledgling NATO they 're labeling AUP  --  unless we allow their own ideology perfect freedom in Baraza . It must be one or the other , but not both . " Representative Wickland called out toward the microphone box , " Mr. President , what if we support both measures  --  banning of Communism in Baraza as well as membership in the new AUP ? What do you think Kasatkin would do ? " " The works , Harv , the works , " said the President . " Premier Kasatkin warned me Soviet troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adherents in and around India and Brazil . I think he means it this time . And if he does , we 're in for a shooting war , and we 'd have to fire the first shot . " " But , Mr. President ? " It was Assistant Secretary Jed Stover 's pained and trembling voice . " That 's absolute blackmail . We 're committed to AUP as well as giving Baraza the absolute right to do as it pleases , and apparently Baraza wants to curb Communism . I do n't blame Amboko . He has a new and uncertain democratic coalition . His minority of Communists are militant and dangerous . If we  | give in on either point , drop out of AUP or force Amboko to leave the Communists alone , the Reds might infiltrate every free nation of Africa , and control the continent in a year . " The loudspeaker was quiet , and those waiting in the Cabinet Room were quiet , too , and at last ' I ' . C. 's reply came through the loudspeaker from distant Frankfurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure we understand our Soviet friends very well . We know what they want . We have to prevent then- Inun getting it . The question is where do we stop them , and when do we see the whites of their eyes ? In Baraza ? I do n't think so I 'd 1 ; : 0e to risk American lives over some godforsaken little tract of laud in West Africa . I do n't want to have the distinction of having been the last President of the United States , the one who encouraged nuclear annihilation . I 'm more worried ; iixnit ( : ern-anv , India , Brazil than I am about Africa . " " Mr. Iresident . ' The voice had come from the far side of the cofOnlike table , and it belonged to Senator Dihnan , whose fingers were drumming the table nervously . " Mr. President , " he repeated , " I 'm sure you are  --  are right  --  yes  --  hut if we back away from Africa , wo n't we wot ; ld n't we riot only lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak ? I 'm not disagreeing , only I am won-dering " Who was that ? " inquired T.C. " I do n't recognize the voice . " " That was Senator Dilman , Mr. President , " said Arthur Eaton . " Oh , Dilman , " said T.C. " Fine , Dilman . Well , I would n't worry too much about losing Africa to anyone . Those people know we 're with them . They see our money . They see we 're really making an effort to solve the civil rights problem in the United States . As to showing any weakness to the Soviets , I 'm not concerned about that either . They 've counted our ICBMs , you can bet . They know we have muscles . No , I think we stand to gain more by showing a readiness to bargain , to give a little in order to get a little , than by being bullheaded . The question is how to proceed , how to concede wit In strength , how to conciliate the Russians , while reassuring the Africans we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we have emerged from Frankfurt with a victory , that we have preserved the peace of the world ? " Arthur Eaton edged forward in his chair . " Mr. President , what is your impression of Premier Kasatkin this time around ? Do you feel that he is sincere ? Do you feel that he will keep hands off in Berlin , Brazil , India , if you make a concession about Africa ? " " Oh , definitely , Arthur . No doubt about it . He 's a roughneck , and  | crafty , peasant crafty , but he is blunt and honest . I think he wants to live and let live , if there is no other choice . Anyway , MacPherson and I have been kicking this around , and we have come up with a possible approach . We want your opinion on the strategy . Listen carefully ? " Listening carefully , Edna Foster , seated five chairs from the loudspeaker box , crossed her legs again , ready to hook her penciled ciphers across her shorthand pad , if required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the stenotype set between his legs . Since all sound in the room had ceased , Edna glanced up . The intent faces of the President 's advisers seemed to form human parentheses around the loudspeaker , as each individual prepared to concentrate on what would come next from the Chief Executive in Frankfurt . Finally there was T.C. 's familiar voice once more , washed over by the atmospheric static above an ocean that divided him from those who heard him . The President 's tone was low-keyed and insistent . " When I go back into that Roemer conference room with those bandits this afternoon , I want to tell them that the Senate is going to ratify the African Unity Pact this week . And that I intend to sign it when I return home . This ratification is necessary  --  I want to tell them that  --  because we have made a pledge to our African friends , and we want to keep our word . I want to assure Kasatkin , however , that we will never implement the Pact , act upon it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign power is attempting to interfere , militarily , with the sovereign rights of the Pact members . On the other hand , I want to be able to tell Premier Kasatkin , because we want peace , not only in Germany , India , Brazil , but everywhere , that we are ready to use our great moral influence in Baraza to convince its leader not to permit any discriminatory legislation against Communism to be passed into law . That should do it . I think that can wind it up , and I can come home and tell our people they can sleep safely in their beds for another year . " However , I need your cooperation , need help from all of you there , and I 've got to know what you can do for me , and how far I can go with the Russians today . John , I want you to bang ratification of the Pact through the Senate as fast as possible , no matter how long you have to keep in session . At the same time , Harvey , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pact countries out of the House committee and onto the floor . And I want it publicized , this support of our African friends . Then you , Arthur , you can call in  | Ambassador Wamba , and tell him we 've got to get that anti-Communist legislation in Baraza quashed . Tell him to let his opposition natives have their little Communist Party . We 'll keep an eye on it . Tell him to let his students go to the U.S.S.R. on a cultural exchange . Let him keep an eye on that . Tell him our joining the new African Unity Pact is evidence enough of our continuing support . If he balks , put on the pressure . I wo n't stand for any nonsense . I am determined to 1w the President who kept the peace of the world intact . Now , if you approve , what l want from you there in Washington is your promise that  --  that - wait , one second , MacPherson is calling out sonwthing ? " Abruptly the President 's voice was gone , and through the perforated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound , like canvas being ripped , and then a tinny whine , and then the earsplitting falsetto crackle of static , and then dead silence . Arthur Eaton had reached forward , placing a hand on the microphone box as if to steady it , and quietly he spoke into the box . " Mr. President  --  hello , Mr. President , we can not hear you , we have lost you . Try again , please try again . " IIc remained immobilized , head cocked , listening for a response , but there was no sound . His hand shook the microphone box slightly . " T.C. , this is Arthur here . Can you hear me ? " The loudspeaker stood mute . Eaton stared at it a moment , then looked about the room at the others . " I think we have been disconnected . We 'll have to get him back . " General Pitt Fortney was already on his feet , hurrying to the ordinary green handset telephone at Edna Foster 's elbow . " Let me get hold of the Signal Corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to time with the mechanical unscrambler . I 'll have them track the trouble down . We 'll be hooked up again in a few minutes . " While General Fortney called the Department of the Army , reporting the communications failure , barking his displeasure , demanding that the line to his Commander in Chief be restored , Edna Foster had the mental picture , a Brueghel in animation , of a thousand little enlisted men with repair tools scurrying up and down the ramps of the Pentagon Building . General Fortney 's stars and his ribbons and his raw Texas accent always frightened her , and she wanted to be as far away from him as possible . Since General Fortney was still on the telephone above her , Edna put down her pad , pushed back her chair and stood up . She found the silver silent butler , and began to move about the  | Cabinet table , emptying ashtrays into it . Here and there , around the table , the participants in the conference call had shifted positions on their chairs to discuss the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Roemer Conference and what must be done about it . Senator Dilman was removing the cellophane from a fresh Upmann cigar , as he listened to Senator Selander and Representative Wickland discuss the possibility of expediting ratification of the African Unity Pact . Selander expressed confidence that he would have sufficient votes to obtain passage of the Pact through the Senate . Still , to win the necessary votes , he felt that he would have to do some shrewd horse-trading in the cloakrooms and at luncheons in the Hotel Congressional . He hated , he was admitting , to make concessions on the important Minorities Rehabilitation Program being debated by the Labor and Public Welfare Committee , but it might be necessary . As soon as the connection was made again with Frankfurt , he would ask the President how much he could concede to the opposition floor leader in return for his full support of AUP . Cleaning out the last of the ashtrays , Edna could hear Assistant Secretary Jed Stover and Governor Wayne Talley once more locked in disagreement . Stover was saying that any weakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro protest groups in the United States . Talley would not accept this . He tried to reduce Stover to the role of uninformed outsider . Talley was retorting that both he and the President had already met with the Reverend Paul Spinger , and the clergyman had assured them that the vast and conservative Crispus Society , which he headed and which had outgrown the NAACP in membership and power , would be satisfied with the ratification of the African Unity Pact . " Wayne , I 'm not speaking of the Crispus Society or the NAACP , " Jed Stover was saying . " I 'm not sure they 're the voice of protest any longer . Most Negroes are becoming impatient with their drawn-out legalistic efforts . Most Negroes want what they want here and now , and they are turning to more aggressive organizations like the Turnerites . Did n't you read Jeff Hurley 's statement in last night 's Post ? He made it clear in that speech in Detroit that the Turnerites were not going to twiddle their thumbs while the Attorney General 's office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crispus Society made appeals to higher courts . Hurley said they were on the verge of undertaking a new policy of unremitting dem-  | onstration , and if molested for protest , they would retaliate , demanding an eye for an eye . How do you think this group will react when they learn that the President is forcing Africans to rescind pending legislation in order to please the Soviets ? This group and others like it take pride in Baraza 's unique freedom , keep using Baraza as their model of equal rights , keep insisting that is all they want here at home . I think ? " " Oh , knock it off , Jed , " Talley said impatiently . " Do n't lecture me , and do n't waste ' t ' . C. 's time with that unsubstantiated nonsense . Nobody 's listening to the ' l'urnerites or any crackpots like them . They mean nothing , nothing at all . Reverend Spinger admitted to the President that the ' 1'iirnerites were a small splinter group who 'd left his Crisp 's Society , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were inconsequential , and that there were always some elements who had to let off steam . Jed , you 've got to stop confusing issues . Baraza is one thing . Our own domestic Negro situation is another thing . If the President can keep Baraza happy , and at the same time contain the Russians , then he has achieved a diplomatic marvel . As to our civil rights problems here , when the Minorities Rehabilitation Program is passed into law , that 'll put an end to Negro protest . Relax , Jed , just relax . Let T.C. perform as President . He 'll manage for all of us . " " There 's too much compromise , " Jed Stover said feebly , but he seemed helpless , and said it more to himself than to anyone . Edna Foster , after dumping the ashes from the silent butler into a wastebasket , had been watching and listening . She noticed that Arthur Eaton , slumped in his leather chair , fingers pressed together , eyes narrowed , had been watching and listening also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Fortney had completed his calls to the Pentagon , and was marching toward the center of the room opposite Eaton . " Well , finally got those chowderheads hopping , " Fortney announced . " Everything checked out on this end . Nothing wrong on this end . Our communication is A-1 . Signal Corps reports the disconnection took place on the other end . Line came down in Frankfurt . They 're getting in touch with our Army Communication Center in Wiesbaden , and with our Consulate in Frankfurt . They expect repairs to be made on the double . " " Any idea how long it will take ? " asked Eaton . " Ten minutes , no more than ten minutes , " said General Fortney . " So we 've got a little recess before the President comes on again .  | ... Hey , Miss Foster , how 's about having some coffee brought up from the Navy Mess ? " Not ten minutes but nearly twenty minutes had passed , and still the direct communications line from the Alte Mainzer Palace in Frankfurt am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , D.C. , had not been repaired . Only General Pitt Fortney , who had asked Edna to order the coffee , had not had the time to finish more than half of his cup . Impatient with the delay , irritated by the unexplained inefficiency , he had been up and down , at the handset telephone and away from it and back to it , belaboring the Signal Corps for not yet making the President 's private line operative . Minutes ago he had bellowed into the telephone at some Pentagon underling , " Dammit , Colonel , if you are n't fixing to get those wires up , I 'm going to get SAC to fly me over in a B-70 and do the job myself . Now , get cracking ! " They were no longer gathered around the Cabinet table . General Fortney , like a caged and offended beast , was pacing near the telephone . Jed Stover stood beside the bookcase , beneath the mantel with its model ships , examining the titles of the various volumes . Near him , propped on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stub of his cigar , and again reading a sheet of paper he held in his hand . Before the open door to Edna 's office , Senator Selander and Representative Wickland were engaged in a conversation . Secretary of State Eaton , his back to the others , his hands clasped behind him , stood at the French doors contemplating the Rose Garden in the dull August morning . Governor Talley was making an inquiry of Leach , the stenotypist . Thus it was that Edna Foster found them , as she returned to the Cabinet Room from her office where she had met with Tim Flannery , the press secretary , to inform him that the conference call , while still interrupted , would soon be resumed . Passing Selander and Wickland , she heard a snatch of their conversation . Senator Selander was saying , " Do n't you worry your head none about old Hoyt Watson . He 's the most reliable member of the Senate . Southerner or not , he 's still aware of our responsibilities abroad . He 'll go with T.C. It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . Ca n't you control Zeke Miller and that lousy newspaper chain of his ? He has n't let up a day on our participation in Africa . "  | Representative Wickland was at once defensive . " Leave him to me , I can handle him . He likes T.C. IIe 's received plenty of patronage from T.C. If I tell him the President wants African aid , why , Zeke Miller wo n't obstruct him . " Senator Selander appeared unconvinced . " For someone who likes T.C. , he 's sure raising hell with T.C. 's Cabinet . Did you see what he let Reb Blaser publish in the Citizen-American about Eaton ? Dirty politics , I tell you . " Edna Foster , who had hung back to hear the last , saw that both Majority Leaders were turning to inspect Eaton . Embarrassed at eavesdropping , she hurried to her purse lying on the table . Opening it to find a cigarcttc , she cast a surreptitious glance at Eaton , still at the French doors , still contemplating the Rose Garden . She wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Washington Citizen-American . Leaving dinner the night before last , George had bought the newspaper , peering briefly at the baseball scores and Itch 1laser 's story as they walked toward her apartment . George had showed her the column . It had been devoted to the low moral tone of the Department of State , and then boldly revealed information " from an inside informant " that the Secretary of State and his attractive socialite wife , Kay Varney Eaton , were on the verge of a divorce . The gossip column had pointed out that of the 365 days past , Kay Varney Eaton and her husband had been together , in the capital city , only sixty-eight days . In fact , Reb Blaser had pointed out , she was now in Miami , being seen in nightclubs with Cartnell , the renowned decorator , while her equally renowned husband rattled around alone in their elegant Georgetown mansion . " We can only hope , " Reb Blaser had concluded , " that our Secretary of State will be more successful in maintaining peace with the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edna remembered that she had considered Blaser 's column disgraceful , and she had blamed his publisher , Congressman Zeke Miller , for allowing , even encouraging , such attacks . She had been surprised to find George defending both Blaser and Miller . He had , he had said , only admiration for their news sense and for their honesty . Edna had quickly forgiven George , understanding that as a member of the White House press corps , he would naturally defend and admire his own . Now Edna realized that Arthur Eaton had come away from the window , and caught her staring at him . Flushing , she turned away , only to observe Senator Dilman going out the corridor door , prob-  | ably to the washroom . She decided to talk to Ted Stover at the bookshelves . Starting toward the Assistant Secretary for African Affairs , she became aware of a folded paper lying on the green carpet behind Stover . Quickly she went to it , picked it up , and opened it in order to find out to whom it belonged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Trafford University . " In the left corner was the smaller lettering , " Office of the Chancellor  --  Dr. Chauncey L. McKaye . " It was addressed to " Dear Senator Dilman . " Not meaning to go further , but unable to escape the typed words in the single paragraph that followed , Edna realized that the head of the University , at the suggestion of the dean of men , was writing the Senator about his son , Julian Dilman , a sophomore , whose grades had seriously fallen off and who would have to be placed on probation if this continued . She noticed words like " inattentive " and " disrespectful , " and the phrase " more interested in outside activities of late than in his schooling . " She folded the letter , embarrassed to have seen its private contents , but for the first time she thought of Dilman as a human being . Of those in the room , she knew Senator Dilman the least . This was because , since T.C. had been President , Dilman had been less frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few days between the Vice-President 's death and the President 's departure for Frankfurt had Dilman appeared several times with the Majority Leader . But now this letter in Edna 's hand : it gave him a son , a son who was a problem , and it made him a father , not just another senator but a human being . Noticing that Dilman had reappeared , and was making his way toward Selander and Wickland , Edna hurried to intercept him . " Senator , I found this on the floor , " she said . " Apparently you dropped it . I 'm sorry , I had to open it . " Senator Dilman accepted the letter with the slightest smile . " It 's quite all right . Thank you . " Edna turned in time to see Wayne Talley approaching Eaton . " Arthur , it 's past two in the afternoon in Frankfurt . T.C. 's probably gone back into the conference . Think there 's any point in waiting around like this ? " Eaton shrugged . He addressed not only Talley but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait . The President just may feel this is important enough to delay the conference . He may want to speak to us further . "  | As if the deferment in resuming communications was a personal affront , General Fortney charged at the regular telephone once more . For the hundredth time , it seemed , he was calling the Signal Corps . About to continue to her chair , and shorthand pad , Edna slowed down , listening hard . She thought that she had heard her own telephone ring in her office . She was listening , trying to make it out above Fortncy 's voice , when she heard Representative Wickland , the person nearest to her open door , call to her , " Miss Foster , your phone . " She darted past the Congressman into her office , slipped between the electric typewriter stand and the table holding the television set , and caught up the receiver in mid-ring . " Hello , " she answered , " the President 's office . " For a suspended moment she heard nothing more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then a voice came on , a strange voice from far away , and it said , " Is this the White blouse ? Who is this ? " " This is the President 's personal secretary , Miss Foster . May I ask who is calling ? " " Oh , Miss Foster  --  Miss Foster ? " And suddenly Edna felt goose pimples on her arms and a chill across her back , for the disembodied voice was quavering and frantic . " Miss Foster  --  this is Zwinn  --  Ambassador Zwinn in Frankfurt  --  Miss Foster ? " The voice seemed to be choked , and then it shouted out , " There 's been a terrible emergency  --  get me someone  --  Talley  --  get me Talley ! " With emergency , with terrible emergency , Edna found herself shivering , and the receiver in her right hand shaking . " One second  --  one second , please ? " She blinked at the open door to the Cabinet Room , and screamed out , " Governor Talley ! Governor , come here , something terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rim , puzzled , curious , searching her face . She merely wagged her head , wordlessly , and shoved the receiver into his hands . As he took up the telephone , she backed away from the desk , and could see the room rapidly filling with the others , all looking from her to Talley , wonderingly . " Who ? " Talley was saying into the receiver . " Zwinn ? Oh , Ambassador , I did n't know ? " His speech halted as abruptly as if his throat had been cut . He listened , and listened , and as he did so , his lips began to move , but dumbness remained , and his face turned grayer and grayer until it was finally ghost-white . At last he spoke .  | " Are you sure ? Are you positive ? The President ? " And then listening , lifting his head from the mouthpiece to stare at Eaton and the others . " Yes , Ambassador , " he was saying again , " yes , I understand  --  I ca n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll tell them . We 'll get right back to you . " Talley lowered the receiver onto the cradle , and stood rooted to the spot , a portrait of stunned disbelief . Eaton came slowly toward him . " What the devil is wrong , Wayne ? What has happened ? " Talley tried to speak , tried to form the words , mouthing them , then stuttering them out . " The Pres  --  President  --  the President is dead ! " " What ? " Eaton grabbed Talley 's shoulder , roughly shaking him . " What in the hell are you saying ? Who was that ? What did he say ? " " Arthur , that was Ambassador Zwinn . Part of that building in Frankfurt collapsed  --  that goddam ancient Palace  --  the top caved in on two rooms , and one was T.C. 's study  --  where he was talking to us  --  that 's what happened , that 's what cut off the call , broke down everything  --  fell on him , all of them  --  killed him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eaton was ashen , but controlled . " Are you sure ? Is it certain ? " " Dead , " whimpered Talley . " Killed instantly . Blocks , slabs of granite , fell down on him , crushed him . They have the body . Two Secret Service agents in the room , too . Dead , all dead . Oh , God ? God , what a terrible , terrible thing ? " That moment , the corridor door was flung open , and Tim Flannery rushed in , crying out , " Have you heard ? Associated Press just got the bulletin from Frankfurt . The President ? " He halted , eyes going from one dazed face to the other , and then he knew that they had heard . Eaton 's face was hidden in his palms , and then suddenly he looked up . " The President dead , " he said . " That means the Speaker of the House  --  Wayne , what about the Speaker ? Earl MacPherson was in there  --  what about him ? " Talley did not seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , is MacPherson alive or dead ? " " Alive , " muttered Talley . " He  --  I do n't know  --  I think he 's in pretty good shape  --  nothing critical  --  they 've got him over at the hospital , they 're working on him . This is the worst tragedy in our history . The worst . What 's going to happen to all of us ? "  | il . Eaton closed his eyes . " Us ? " he repeated . " The roof just fell in on II+ us , too . " And when he opened his eyes , Edna Foster could tell , for the first time , that they were wet . It was hard to tell , because she was weeping , and she did not know if she would ever stop ... . Night had come to Washington , a city , like the nation , dumbed down in grief and mourning . Night had come to the late President 's Oval Office , where those who had worked with him and for him , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and needed him , now filled the sofas and armchairs , forlorn and disconsolate , stood in corners , heavyhearted and helpless , waiting for they knew not what . Edna Foster , eyes swollen , lips still quivering , came into the office with the latest special editions of the evening newspapers , and wobbled through the cheerless room , passing out copies . All who had been in the Cabinet Room ten hours before were present here , but now there were also many others . Edna recognized Attorney General Clay Kemmler , Secretary of the Treasury Vernon Moody , CIA Director Montgomery Scott , Senator Hoyt Watson , Admiral Alfred Rivard , and at least a half-dozen more of equal standing . It seemed that every nook and cranny in the Oval Room was filled , except one , and that one , the vacant place tonight , was the late President 's high-backed , black leather armchair behind the Buchanan desk . Having finished passing out the newspapers , Edna found that she was left with one copy . The group beside the French doors that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Selander , Representative Wickland , General Fortney , and Secretary of State Eaton , were reading the front page of the newspaper that Senator Selander held out for them . Or rather , Edna became aware , all were reading the front page except Eaton , whose attention was disengaged , whose attention was turned inward . Edna lifted the newspaper in her hand and the mammoth headline , six inches high , assailed her : T.C. DEAD IN FRANKFURT ! The second headline , almost as heavy , proclaimed : WORLD MOURNS ACCIDENTAL END OF U.S. PRESIDENT . The third headline , considerably smaller , read : HOUSE SPEAKER MACPHERSON , PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSOR , UNDERGOES SURGERY IN GERMAN HOSPITAL . She felt the sob grow in her lungs and throat , and suppressed it ,  | and looked at the bottom half of the front page . The lead story , in boldface type , spilling across the width of four columns , began : FRANKFURT AM MAIN , August 26 At the time of the fatal accident , ( AP ) ?

" There was much more to the news story , and many more similar stories on the front page , but Edna Foster had no desire to read  | further . Casting the newspaper aside , she realized that Wayne Talley and Tim Flannery were whispering in the doorway to her office . Now Talley was returning , heading for Arthur Eaton . " Stand by , Edna , " he said . Then , reaching Eaton , he said , " They have an open line to Frankfurt . No word on MacPherson yet . IIe 's been almost three hours in surgery . Tim spoke to Ambassador Zwinn briefly . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's still a way to go . But everyone is feeling better . They expect to swear MacPherson in , the minute he comes out of the anesthetic . I think Tim and I better draft a press release . There are more than a thousand accredited correspondents out there baying for news . " " Go ahead , " said Eaton disinterestedly . Talley hesitated . " I know how  --  how you still feel , Arthur . .1 know how close T.C. was to you . I ca n't get used to it myself . I 'm numb . Who would have ever dreamt that such a thing ? " " Go draft that release , " said Eaton curtly . Then he added , " Let me know the second you receive any flash on Mac . " " Okay . " Edna saw Talley signal her . " Edna , " he said , " Tim and I need you . I know it 's tough , but we have to dictate something about MacPherson succeeding T.C. as President . " Sorrowfully , Edna Foster nodded her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth , when her employer would be supplanted by another . She followed the Presidential aide into her small office , shut the door behind her , and observed that Tim Flannery had already drawn up two folding chairs . Since he and Talley were sitting , she went around the desk to take her accustomed place in the walnut swivel chair . She located her shorthand pad and several sharp pencils . Flannery waved toward the pencils . " Do n't take anything yet , Edna . Wayne and I want to talk this out first . " Flannery had already handed the aide a sheaf of papers , which Talley was studying intently . " Everything here ? " Talley inquired , still reading . " Everything , " said Flannery . " The boys on the Judiciary Committee pitched in , and also the justices gave us material , and for the background we had the Legislative Reference Service at the Library of Congress busy . You 'll find the Presidential Succession Acts of 1792 , 1886 , and 1947 in full , with pertinent sections marked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background data , all severely condensed . " " Is n't it amazing how you go along and never think of anything like this , " said Talley . " You 'd think I 'd know most of this , but I do n't . I know eight Presidents died in office , before T.C. , but I never knew this , that eight Vice-Presidents died in office , also . " " Nine Vice-Presidents , counting poor Porter ten days ago . " Talley looked up blankly . " Christ , I forgot all about him . Today seems to have blotted everything else out . " Half listening , Edna doodled on her pad . Then , as Talley read on , she began to print the names of the nine Presidents , including T.C. , who had died in office . She printed : William Harrison , Zachary Taylor , Abraham Lincoln , James Garfield , Warren Harding , Franklin D. Roosevelt , John F. Kennedy , and then T.C. She counted . Eight . Who was the ninth ? Then she remembered , and printed the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she tried to think of the Vice-Presidents who had died in office . She could think of only Elbridge Gerry , Henry Wilson , Garret Hobart , and Porter , and not another . Finally she gave up . There was no use thinking about it . She felt ill . She heard Talley 's strained voice . " I somehow believed that almost every President who did n't finish his term was assassinated , but it says here that not more than four were shot down . " " Lincoln , Garfield , McKinley and Kennedy , " said Flannery , fingers pressing his forehead . " Harrison and Harding died , in part , of pneumonia . Taylor 's death was caused by cholera morbus . F.D.R. suffered a cerebral hemorrhage . Incredible , but poor T.C. was the only one ever to be snuffed out by an accident . " He shrugged . " I suppose it had to happen to someone sometime . " Then he added wretchedly , " Only why did it have to be T.C. ? " Edna had been watching Tim Flannery as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , behind his whole facade of forced factuality , that she liked very much . He was a tall Irishman , with unruly rust-colored hair , and a small reddish mustache , and a wide , ingenuous florid face , now puffy and blotched by sorrow . He looked as tweedy as his suits , with their suede elbow patches , and he had been a Midwest newspaperman who had written several highly respected history books on the side . It said much for him that most of the cynical White House press corps , and her own George among them , liked Tim Flannery . " Chrisamighty , but I 'm sure not in the mood for this , " Governor  | Talley was saying . His one crossed eye contemplated the ceiling and then reluctantly came down to the papers in his hands . " Well , guess somebody 's got to do it . Might as well get it over with . . . . Let me see , Tim , says here that Speaker Earl MacPherson will fill one year and five months of T.C. 's unexpired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a few days , yes , " said Flannery , almost inaudibly . He seemed to make an effort to pull himself together . " All the past Vice-Presidents who succeeded Presidents had over three years of unexpired terms to fill , except Fillmore , who served two years and eight months of Taylor 's term , and Coolidge , who picked up one year and seven months of Ilarding 's unexpired term , and Lyndon Johnson , who served one year and three months of Kennedy 's unexpired term . MacPherson will have a long enough way to go in the  --  in the Presidency . " " Yes , he will , " said Talley with gravity . He touched the papers in his hand . " You say here this is the first time in our history we have ever lost both men elected to serve us for four years . " " Never happened before , " said Tim Flannery . " But as Clinton Rossiter wrote in The American Presidency , This is no guarantee for the future . ' how right he was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you notice that other quotation from Rossiter ? " " Which one ? " Flannery had bent forward and pointed to a paragraph on the top page . " Right there . " He read it aloud . " If we are only poorly prepared for a double vacancy , we are not prepared at all for a multiple vacancy ; and it is this kind of vacancy , so I am told by colleagues who deal in the laws of probability , that we are most likely to be faced with during the next hundred years and beyond . ' " Talley frowned . " I 'm not interested in that . I 'm interested in the facts , Tim , nothing else . We 're faced with a double vacancy , not a multiple one . Let 's check the Presidential Succession Act of 1947 , just get it straight , before we dictate the release to Edna . " He had begun turning the pages , and at last he found it . " Here it is . Okay , clear and simple . If the Presidency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Representatives shall , upon his resignation as Speaker and as Representative in Congress , act as President . " ' His gaze moved down the page . " Yes , clear enough  --  President , Vice-President , Speaker of the House  --  and after that the order of succession is President pro tempore of the Senate , Secretary of State , Secretary of the Treasury , Secretary of Defense , Attorney  | General , and so forth through the Cabinet . " He raised his head . " Any Speaker even come half this close to the Presidency before ? " " Not while Speaker , no , " said Tim Flannery . " One former Speaker , Polk , was later elected President . But none ever ? " " Okay , there 's always got to be a first time , " said Talley . He handed the papers back to the press secretary . " So it 's the Speaker of the House  --  grumpy old Earl MacPherson himself  --  who 'd have believed it possible ? Okay , that 's the law , and no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kind of press announcement . " Flannery snapped his fingers . " I forgot to get a capsule of MacPherson 's background . Some of that should be in , too . " " Definitely , " said Talley . Flannery twisted in his chair toward Edna . " Can you be a good girl and fetch Representative Harvey Wickland in here ? He can give us what we need for now on MacPherson . " Edna came out of her swivel chair , hastened to the door leading to the President 's Oval Office , opened it , and then halted , surprised . Everyone in the crowded room was on his feet , all converging upon Arthur Eaton , who stood in the center of the room , in the middle of the eagle of the United States seal woven into the thick green Presidential rug . Edna turned to Flannery and Talley . " Something 's happening ! " she exclaimed . " Everyone 's gathering around Secretary Eaton . " Immediately , Talley and Flannery jumped to their feet , pushing past her into the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Oval Office . Eaton , his voice dry and low , was speaking aloud . " I have just been called outside to take a telephone call from Frankfurt . I have terrible news to report to all of you , terrible news , and it grieves me . Speaker of the House Earl MacPherson died in surgery , on the table , under the knife , ten minutes ago . This has been confirmed . Now the Speaker is also dead . " A great gasp swelled through the room , and off somewhere there was someone hysterically sobbing , and after that there was a sickening silence . Edna heard Tim Flannery , beside her , whisper , almost to himself , " Multiple vacancy . " The first to be heard speaking aloud was Governor Wayne Talley . " I do n't believe it . " The second to be heard aloud was Arthur Eaton . " It is true . "  | Then it was that General Pitt Fortney called out , " Who in the hell is T.C. 's successor ? " Arthur Eaton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Succession Act of 1947 , the next in line is the President pro tempore of the United States Senate . " For strange and suspenseful seconds , the Secretary of State 's pronouncement hung in the air , and those who heard it were immobilized , allowing it to sink into their minds , as the curved walls with their niches and shelves of dead mementos seemed to close in on them . " The President pro tempore of the Senate , " the Attorney General intoned , as someone might intone Amen . And then at once , all at once , collectively , each in the room seemed to realize who this was , who their next President of the United States was , and all at once all of them , collectively , turned their gaze upon the one man who stood somewhat apart from them , near the Buchanan desk . Everyone , it seemed , was staring at Senator Douglass Dilman . And for Edna it was frightening to see that in each person 's eyes , without exception , there was registered a look of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the arrival of other members of the government , had assembled in the Cabinet Room . They stood now in a semicircle , with an opening in the center for two still photographers and two television cameramen representing the press pool , clustered around the long , dark mahogany table . Once , while waiting , Eaton had asked Douglass Dilman if he had any close relatives or friends in the city whom he might wish to have witness the ceremony . He had replied , in an undertone , " No , sir , no one . " Once , minutes ago , Eaton had beckoned to Edna and Tim Flannery and demanded a Bible . There was much scurrying about , but no copy of the Bible was to be found , until Edna remembered the one in the lower drawer of her desk . She had gone to get it , and found the cheap , battered Bible , a Gideon Bible she had borrowed from a hotel room in Memphis once , on a trip with T.C. , and had forgotten to return , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had brought in the Gideon Bible and given it to Eaton .  | She found herself still standing next to Eaton , who leaned against the high-backed leather chair bearing the tiny brass nameplate " Secretary of State . " She heard Eaton inquire of Senator Dilman , " Do you wish this open on any particular passage ? " She heard Dilman reply , " Psalms 127:1 . " Slowly , Eaton leafed through the book , and then he said , " Is this it ? Except the Lord build the house , they labour in vain that build it : except the Lord keep the city , the watchman waketh but in vain . " ' He glanced inquiringly at Dilman , and Dilman swallowed , his Adam 's apple bobbing , and said , " Yes , sir , that is it . " It was during this moment that Noah F. Johnstone , Chief Justice of the Supreme Court , came through the corridor door and across the room , gravely nodding at the familiar faces turned toward him . Even without his robes , Edna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Chief Justice appeared impressive . He was a giant of a man , with a slight stoop and an uneven gait . His sunken face , wrinkled and wise , betrayed no emotion . He came around the Cabinet table into the glare of klieg lights , nodding to Talley , and then to Dilman and Eaton , and he took his position beside T.C. 's old chair . " Are we ready ? " he inquired of no one in particular , and then he accepted the open Gideon Bible from Eaton , squinted down at it , and said to Dilman , " Take the Holy Book in your left hand and raise your right hand . I will recite the oath of office as it is written in Article II , Section 1 , of the Constitution of the United States . When I have finished , please repeat the oath . " He proffered the Bible to Dilman , who accepted it and held it with difficulty in his left hand , and raised his trembling right hand . Chief Justice Johnstone lifted his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oath of office . When he was done , he waited . After a painful interlude , Douglass Dilman 's thick lips moved , and the words that he repeated came out low and slurred . " I , Douglass Dilman , do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States , and will , to the best of my ability , preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States . " He halted , and looked around the room , bewildered , as if seeking a friend in a company of strangers . The harsh kliegs , blended with the light of the overhead neon grill , made the witnesses to  | the historic tableau seem ghostly . He had lowered his right hand , and suddenly Chief Justice Johnstone reached out and grasped Dilman 's right hand in his own and shook it . " Mr. President , " the Chief Justice was saying , " we deeply mourn the passing of our beloved past President , but the continuity of our government , the welfare of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these perilous times . Our hearts go out to you for your double burden  --  and may the Lord in Heaven bless you and watch over you as States . "  | T WAS the muffled sound of argument that awakened him . There was a thin line of ache behind his forehead as he listened , sorting and separating the muffled sound into two sounds , the first shrill and feminine , cross and indignant , the second low and male , calm and placating . His head was deep in the fat pillow , so deep that when he turned , he could not see the time . The pillow had been handmade by Aldora , almost double-sized and stuffed with gray goose down , and presented to him on their first anniversary , so long ago , when their marriage still had hope . The cross fire of altercation beyond his bedroom wall , increasingly abrasive , continued louder . He lifted himself ever so slightly on his forearm and was able to make out the time on the electric clock humming upon the end table beside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room was darkened by the drawn shades , he knew that it was morning . He realized that he had meant to be awakened earlier , had meant to set the alarm , but had forgotten to do so before falling asleep . The shutoff lever on his telephone had banished all calls , and in his utter exhaustion he had slumbered on and on . It was shameful , he thought behind the headache , and , as always , to do anything shameful alarmed him . Other men could afford mistakes , small and large , but he could afford none , not the smallest one . Several times , during his residence in Washington , he had awakened with the remnant of  | the same dream , that he had been treading water in an enormous aquarium , and that all its sides were painted with blue eyes staring at him . The shimmering fragment of dream had always left him uneasy . But now , the private hook of humor that he possessed but had not dared to reveal to anyone but Wanda and his closest friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free to admit to himself that he had performed his first act as the President of the United States . Ile had overslept . Suddenly the enormity of what had happened last night , and of what he was , oppressed him with its unreality and automatically forced him to retreat into the cup of the down pillow . Ile had , he remembered , been told by someone last night that , after formally resigning from the Senate , he had become the President of the United States at ten thirty-seven in the evening . He had not been returned to his brownstone row house until after one o'clock in the morning . It was almost impossible to recollect what had taken place in the time between . Ile had signed something , yes , his first official signing ; he had affixed his name to the proclamation that poor Speaker MacPherson was supposed to have signed , the same statement that had been hastily prepared for the Speaker and was to have been flown to Frankfurt . This proclamation was the official announcement of T.C. 's funeral and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of State Arthur Eaton and Governor Wayne Talley expound on the critical Roemer Conference , and he had not absorbed a word of it . He had sat with them , smoking cigars until his eyes smarted and his throat felt blistered , and he had sat with the sympathetic press secretary , yes , Tim Flannery , the redhead , preparing the carefully worded release to all the news media . Then others had swum about them , senators and representatives whom he had known during work hours for years , and T.C. 's Cabinet members , whom he had hardly known at all , and they had spoken of approaches and strategies and public relations and the Party , and he had been grateful that they had addressed Eaton and Talley and Flannery and not himself . He had been almost physically ill from the tension of the events of that day and evening , and after midnight there had been a stirring and rising , and he had been released , guided to a Cadillac limousine outside the South Portico . He remembered protesting against the two Secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and protesting , with embarrassment , against both the motorcycle escort of police which had preceded him and the second car of agents which had followed him to his home . He recalled the scene outside his brownstone , and how he had begged Hugo Gaynor , the Chief of Secret Service , who had followed him into his living room , to go home , and how Gaynor had been adamant about staying . And he remembered how he had surrendered from exhaustion , desiring only to escape to his bedroom and sleep alone , away from the blue eyes around the glass aquarium . The sound of the argument beyond his bedroom wall was persisting . It had probably been going on steadily in the seconds of his introspection . And now , at last , he was able to place himself accurately in the time of day and the routine of his former life , and he knew what was happening in his living room . It was Crystal and a Secret Service agent who were locked in debate . Crystal had come to him , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House of Representatives , and because he had been alone , and was still alone , she had grown fiercely maternal in her devotion to his comfort . Five days a week she appeared at eight-thirty to prepare his breakfast , make his bed , clean his flat , market for him . She worked until twelve-thirty , then disappeared to tend to her own household , which included her sister 's family , and then returned at three-thirty , remaining to cook and serve his dinner , often not leaving until eight o'clock in the evening . She was a poor cook , a burner of toast , and a slipshod domestic , a sweeper under the rug , but she was prompt , loyal , busy , and relatively unobtrusive ( that is , until recently , when she had taken to carrying on , always quoting her brother-in-law , a gas station attendant , about the Turnerite Group , who were out to ruin the one chance that the colored folk would ever have for economic improvement through that rehabilitation subsidy act for Negroes that was being talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altercation in the living room was clear to him . Crystal had arrived as usual , and found the Secret Service waiting , which was unusual . The irresistible force had collided with the immovable object . Douglass Dilman threw aside his electric blanket and swung out of bed . He stood up , straightening his blue pajamas , stuck his feet into the misshapen slippers , picked his polka-dot cotton robe off the chair and pulled it on . He walked to the bureau mirror and looked at himself . His black kinky hair , as always after sleep , was  | shoved high into a peak at the back of his head . He took the widetoothed comb and ran it through his full hair , smoothing down the peak . He poked at the inner corners of his bloodshot eyes , to wipe and clear them . He studied his broad indelicate countenance . He was dark  --  well , black , but not coal-black  --  and his features were Negroid . His forehead was high , his nose full and wide , his lips heavy and protruding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet fat , but stocky and thick . Tim Flannery , he remembered , had asked for the statistics last night , and Ice had said that he was five feet ten inches ( cheating a half-inch for more stature ) and 180 pounds . His appearance , a big-city ward heeler had once told him , worked for him . His lack of height , his tackiness , the antithesis of the fearsome young it Negro brick , combined with mild , refined Caucasian speech and mannerisms , made hint more acceptable to the white labor voters ; his unmistakable Negro features made him authentic . and agreeable to the black menial voters . Oftentimes in the past , he had wished that he could be all one or the other , like the members of his family . Pitiful dead Aldora had been light tan , often mistaken for a Spaniard , and he was sure this had contributed to what had happened . Wretched Julian , his son , was as dark as himself , black really , but possessed of features less coarse than his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been when he had last set eyes on her six years ago ) white and beautiful , white and lovely , which had pleased her mother , had worried him , had made Julian resentful , and had made Mindy herself haughty and impossible . He thought that he heard Crystal 's sharp voice through the wall . " Wake him up ! " she was demanding . He knotted the belt of his robe , crossed to the door , went through the narrow hallway , and turned left into the living room . The sight that met him was not unexpected . Beneath the arch that led from the entry hall into the living room stood the shiny , bulging Crystal , shapeless in her tent of brown coat , still holding the morning newspapers in one hand and the inevitable huge straw basket ( for leftovers for her sister 's hound ) in her right hand . Blocking her way stood lanky , elderly ITugo Gaynor , Chief of the Secret Service , and the well-proportioned ex-California athlete whom Dilman recognized as Lou Agajanian , Chief of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Crystal who saw Dilman first .  | She waved her fat hand and shrieked , " Senator ! They wo n't let me in  --  I got ta get up breakfast . " Gaynor spun around , and Agajanian did the same , and both were instantly respectful and apologetic . " Mr. President , " Gaynor said , " we have no idea who this lady is . We ca n't let people without credentials in here simply because they say they work for you . Can you imagine what ? " Dilman nodded . " She 's quite safe , Mr. Gaynor . Crystal has been my housekeeper for years . I should have advised you last night . ... Hello , Mr. Agajanian , I think we 've met once or twice . .. . Good morning , Crystal . It 's all right now . You can come in . " Obediently the agents parted , backed off , and the magic of it made Crystal 's eyes widen . Her unsubtle black face was almost comically transformed from indignation to triumph to pleasure to awe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I  --  I almost forgot to say , Senator  --  President  --  Mr. President  --  but I want to be the first to wish you well , and also for my sister and brotherin-law and the kids . " " Thank you , Crystal , thank you . " She began to go sideways , still awed , and then she stopped . " We stayed up late and it was all over the television . Everyone was sorry about the others , but we 're happy that , if it had to be , then mercy , we 're sure-enough happy it is you . I  --  I almost did n't come here this morning . I was sort of sure you 'd be in the White House , with a special fancy staff , and not needing me any more . " Dilman smiled . " I wo n't be in the White House for a while , and you can be sure , Crystal , I 'll want you then as much as I want you now . " She seemed overwhelmed with relief . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Suddenly her round face broke into a toothy smile , enamel and gold , and she said , " I 'll have to take lessons how to talk to you . What 'll it be this special morning , anything special ? " " The same as always , Crystal . Give me fifteen minutes or so . I 've got to shower and dress . " She was off to the dining room and kitchen , straw basket swinging , and Dilman smiled at the two Secret Service executives . " She 's here every day , " he said , " and weekends her niece comes in . " Gaynor said , " We 'll have to trouble you for a full list of your employees and friends . " " You 'll have it today . " " Mr. President , there are a number of calls that have come in ? "  | " Anything important ? " " I do n't believe anything urgent . The Secretary of State wants to speak to you when you 're up . Oh yes , one personal call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York  --  a young man who claims to be your son . " " Julian ? " " That 's right , Mr. President . Gave the name Julian Dilman . Said he 'd call back again at half past nine . " " All right . Better give me time to get myself cleaned up and into some clothes . " Ile started to go , then said over his shoulder , " You can ask Crystal to make something for you . You must be starved . " " Thank you , Mr. President , " the two Secret Service officers said simultaneously . The tone of their voices hung inside Douglass Dilman 's ears as he walked back to the bedroom . He was attuned to every nuance of every utterance that came from his white colleagues . The changeable inflection of speech was their civilized weapon of subtle mockery and superiority without insult , even when you were a congressman . This was their best weapon when they found that your skin was black and thin . You could not prove disrespect , but you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Pitt Fortney had appeared as a witness before him and the others . He had posed a question , and Fortney 's reply , in print , on the record , had been beyond reproach . In writing , it was a general replying sensibly to a senator . Across the committee tables , verbalized , it had been a West Point white general speaking downward to a semiliterate jigaboo . Perhaps he had been oversensitive that time , and on several other recent occasions . For years he had tried to curb his excessive sensitivity , as other men tried to reduce their weight . It took diligent , unremitting work . It could be done . But then , every once in a while , you put on sudden sensitivity as you put on extra weight , and suffered for the added burden . Throwing aside his robe , entering the bathroom , he decided that the two Secret Service heads , Gaynor and Agajanian , had been courteous in their behavior . And now it seemed reasonable that they should have been . To their dedicated eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was Grover Cleveland or Woodrow Wilson or Dwight D. Eisenhower or T.C. or Douglass Dilman . All that mattered to them , their jobs , their future , their pride , was that they keep the pounds of flesh entrusted to them , whatever its pigmentation , alive .  | He unbuttoned his pajama top , stripped it off , and removed the pajama trousers . Opening the shower door , he adjusted the knobs inside , then started the spray of water . Finding soap and cloth , he wondered how many other white men would be as courteous as his bodyguards . The personalities whose speeches he had heard , whose bright remarks he had heard , whose prejudices he had known , crossed his mind : the Southern congressmen , the Northern committeemen , the Western rightists , the Eastern Ivy League snobs . A son of Ham , he thought , in the White House , in the Oval Office of the West Wing , in the highest seat extant in this red , white , and blue ( not black ) republic . Despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there could be a Negro in the Presidency in thirty or forty years , there had been no one of equal stature , then or now , no matter how wise or liberal , who believed that it could happen then or in this century . Yet it had happened , by accident . Stepping into the shower cell , he knew that he had been insulated since last night from what was happening out there , in the capital city , in the cities of the fifty states . How stunned the American people must be this hour to learn they would have to look up to an outsider , a member of the ten-per-cent black minority of their white country . It was not the first spray of the shower that chilled him , but the first realization of what had happened and how wildly it would be resented . He remembered the short poem : " How odd/ of God/ to choose/ the Jews . " He paraphrased it : How odd of God to choose me , to choose one who had already gone high enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher for himself , one who wished only to be limited to his legislative height , where reticence and diffidence would still keep him an unresented exhibit that was a sop to the liberal conscience of the North . Then the Chief Justice 's wrenching words of last night came back to him : " may the Lord in Heaven bless you and watch over you . . . as the first Negro . . . President of the United States . " His limbs felt weak , so weak , and his heart thudded inside its chest cavity . There were a million white men who were right for the job . There were a thousand black men who would have bravely and defiantly welcomed the Godsent opportunity , and called it Godsent . Yet something , something , had gone wrong Up There . The  | Lord had poked His heavenly finger at the wrong name , and now it was too late . He wanted to rebuke the Maker for His blunder , and then , strangely  --  out of respect to the memory of his mother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear of the hellfire that had been sounded in that old Michigan church in the room behind the broken-down social club , when he was in knee pants  --  he was humble before that God and the Son of God ; and his bitterness and fear , really it was deep-down cringing fear , turned to shame . This was no place for kneeling , but when there was the time and the place , he would beg forgiveness and beg for help . Yet , Jesus , Jesus , wiry did it have to be himself , Douglass Dilman , who was not white and who was afraid of being black , and who was without armor or grace ? Then as the shower 's liquid needles , warmer now , hit his chest , and the foam ran down his stomach and thighs , and as he absently rubbed himself with the soapy cloth and allowed the stream of water to dissolve the soap , he thought that his position , despite his secret inadequacy , was not entirely bad . His mind went backward to last night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House limousine had taken him home . What had happened then was , in retrospect , heartening . When he had become a member of the House of Representatives , he had leased the upstairs front apartment of a red brick , two-story apartment building between Georgia Avenue and Sixteenth Street . The three rooms and kitchenette , modest and clean , had been sufficent to serve his widower existence . The location had been comfortably in the midst of a onetime white neighborhood , now occupied by upper-class Negroes . But the apartment had soon become too small for him . Senator Espinosa , who had grown senile and disabled , had resigned two-thirds of the way through his term . The Governor of Dilman 's state , to strengthen his position with his vast Negro voting population  --  which had trebled with the influx of colored families from the South  --  and with the liberal union leaders , had appointed Dilman to Espinosa 's vacant office for the two years remaining . Dilman as Senator had found himself , briefly , a rara avis . Having left Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his fifth House term , he had returned to Washington as a Senatorial appointee . One of the few Negroes to achieve so high a seat in government , he had been the subject of lead articles in such magazines as Life , Look , Time , and Newsweek , and he had made the covers of Ebony and Sepia . He had vaguely felt a freak  | and been discomfited , but , encouraged by the Party bosses , he had cooperated with one and all . It had been during this transitional period , when he had been the object of so much attention , when his mail had swelled , when he had received callers ( mostly political , mostly pressure ) , that he had decided that his rented apartment could no longer serve him . He had found that the parlor and kitchenette were too cramped , and there was need of a study and library at home . He had begun to search for a larger apartment , but the rents demanded had appalled him . Gradually he had concluded that it might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , his adopted city , and would likely remain his home for years to come . While he was a senator from his state by appointment , and only for a short period , and while he had no idea if he would be a senator again , he was confident that he could regain his old House seat . And even if that were not possible , he could go into private law practice in the capital city where , with a population 55 per cent Negro , a highly reputed Negro attorney would have enough clients to keep him occupied and secure . Guided by real estate brokers , he had visited three brownstones in his neighborhood , and in each instance had felt that the house was overpriced and too expensive for his meager savings . The fourth brownstone had come to his attention by chance . Seated one morning behind his desk in the Old Senate Office Building , he had learned that the Reverend Paul Spinger was in his reception room , eager to see him . ; A visit paid by Spinger was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest Negro organization in America , the Crispus Society , had often come to Dilman to discuss civil rights legislation . That morning , as far as Dilman could recall , there had been no immediate business to discuss . He had invited Reverend Spinger in , and the elderly but energetic clergyman-lobbyist had said that the word was around that Dilman wanted to buy a house . If true , he happened to know of a house not yet on the market , whose owner had to sell in a hurry , and which might be bought at a reasonable price , in view of its value as an investment . It was a ten-room , two-story brownstone off Sixteenth Street , on Van Buren N.W. , and it was a bargain at $45,000 . It was , Spinger had said , a solid , aged abode , that one day could stand remodeling , but was comfortable enough and well located on the fringe of the wealthier Negro section , near Walter Reed General Hospital . Spinger knew about the house in advance , he had said , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upstairs for several years . The  | landlord had lived downstairs . Half jokingly , Spinger hoped that Senator Dilman would consider it . If someone else bought the house , they might require all ten rooms and evict the Spingers . The Senator , Spinger had reasoned , was a widower , with his son in boarding school , and would have no need for more than the downstairs rooms . Senator Dilman had gone with the clergyman to visit the brownstone , and he had been enchanted by the quiet residential street with its maple trees , the small green front lawn , the walk up to the entry hall , the generous , comfortable rooms and nineteenth-century fixtures . Immediately he had bargained for it and closed the deal . That had been five years ago , more than five years ago , and not one day had Dilman regretted the financial encumbrance . For to this brownstone off Sixteenth Street Dilman owed not only his first real pleasure in having a place where he belonged , but also his enduring relationship with Wanda Gibson , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house his first feeling of acceptance as the new and accidental Chief Executive of the United States . Last night , he thought . And then his memory held on last night . The feeling of acceptance had come at some time after one o'clock in the morning . As his chauffeured limousine turned into Van Buren Street , Dilman , sandwiched between the Secret Service agents , had become aware of a phenomenon . This was a well-off Negro neighborhood , but a hard-working one , and its inhabitants went to sleep early . The thoroughfare was always blanketed in darkness well before midnight . But last night , after midnight , the street was lighted with illumination from every house , and alive as a Mardi Gras . And then , as they had neared his brownstone , Dilman realized that Van Buren Street was thickly lined on both sides with people , neighbors and others of the capital city , who had come to be the first to set eyes upon America 's new President . When the limousine had drawn up before his front lawn , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attendance had overwhelmed him , almost one thousand persons , he had guessed . The faces , many recognizable , had been mostly black , but there were whites here and there , although Dilman had been unable to discern if they were reporters , Secret Service agents , or simply sensation seekers of the kind who rushed to accidents . As he had walked between the agents to his front door , the applause had begun , then swelled , and there had been cheers . Dilman had paused , deeply moved ,  | and had exhaustedly waved and waved , and then gone inside his house . he had fallen asleep so quickly , he now supposed , because after the first fear and trepidation , the paralysis induced by change and sudden elevation , he had been warmed by friendship and approval . But now the harsher light of morning was upon him . The soothing blackness was gone . The uncertain whiteness waited . He shut off the shower , emerged dripping onto the bath mat , quickly dried himself , then went into the bedroom to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would be expected to attire himself specially for it . He considered his dressiest Sunday black suit , then decided that it would be awkward in the morning . He settled for the charcoal one he had purchased ready-made at Garfinckel 's for his first appearance as temporary presiding officer of the Senate , during the Vice-President 's last trip abroad , six months before his death . As he dressed himself , his mind compulsively revived one more event of last night , one that had taken place a few minutes before he retired . Sitting on his bed , wondering if the Secret Service men in the living room could hear his voice , he had dialed the Spingers upstairs . The phone had hardly begun to ring , when it was answered . The voice he had recognized as belonging to Rose Spinger . " Hello , Rose , I hope I did n't wake you . This is Doug . " Her response had been pitched high with excitement . " Oh , Doug , we hoped  --  heavens , I must n't be calling you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He had smiled to himself tiredly . " Please , Rose , no formality . Nothing has changed between us . I ? " " Thank you , Doug . Oh , my heavens , to think of it ! Did you see us outside in front , in that mob , waving to you ? " " I 'm not sure . I saw Wanda for a second . " " Of course , you would have . We 're all so thrilled . We 're sorry for that accident in Europe , but since it was God 's will , we 're happy you will be there to guide us . We need you , Doug , we all need you , and the Reverend says this is the hand of Providence . . . . Oh , heavens , he 's telling me to be quiet and let you speak to Wanda . All right . Except I want to say for the Reverend and myself , from our hearts , that we wish you strength and courage . " " Thank you , Rose , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock on Wanda 's door . She 's still up . She 'll pick up her phone in a second . " " I 'll wait . Thanks , Rose . " In the seconds that he waited , his brain had become alive and projected the early pictures of Wanda Gibson . When he had bought this brownstone five years ago , and while it was still in escrow , he had been invited to dinner by the Spingers to celebrate his acquisition . He had met the Spingers before , many times , but always about the Hill , or at Crispus Society affairs , or at parties given by African Embassies near Sheridan Circle . This was the first time that he had accepted an invitation to their home . Twice , as a representative , he had been asked to their dinners , and twice he had declined with fabricated excuses . As a member of the House , he had not wanted to be in the position of having to answer to white colleagues who might charge that , as a Negro , he was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His timidity had been ridiculous , he had known , especially since other Negro congressmen and white liberals had attended those dinners in a natural way , and had enjoyed Rose Spinger 's cooking . Thereafter he had told himself that if he was ever invited again , he would accept . The familiar timidity had assailed him but one more time , just before signing the escrow papers on the brownstone house . He had wondered what those on the Hill would think , once it got out , about a senator owning a house in which he permitted the leader of America 's largest minority pressure group to live . Nobody , apparently , had cared . Perhaps , Dilman thought wryly , because nobody , apparently , cared what he did at any time . In the Senate , until his surprising selection in Party caucus to serve as President pro tempore of the body when Vice-President Porter was out of town or ill , few had seemed aware of his existence . He was one of a hundred names on the roll call , rarely absent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no speeches , gave no interviews , introduced no bills , and he went along with the Party and T.C. and everyone . Even though , after filling Espinosa 's unfinished term as Senator , he had been endorsed by the Party to run on his own ( with strong Negro and labor support , against a weak opponent , destroyed by a graft expose four days before the voting ) , and he had been re-elected to the Senate on his own , he had felt an interloper . He had accepted the Spingers ' third invitation to dinner not as  | a senator but as their landlord , and he had gone unafraid , knowing at last that no one , not even such Southern red-neck mouthpieces as Representative Zeke Miller or Senator Bruce Hankins , cared or gave a damn . There had been six of them at that intimate dinner at the Sping ( rs ' five years ago , the host and hostess , a colored engineer and his colored teacher wife , himself as the personage and guest of honor , and Wanda Gibson . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for the first time in the many years since Aldora 's death he had realized that affection and desire within him had not atrophied but had only been sublimated . Even then , five years ago , Wanda had not been a girl , but a mature woman  --  a lady , he had always thought of her as being , a lady  --  of thirty-one . She was a graduate of the University of West Virginia , with economics as her major ; and she had worked for her favorite professor in Morgantown and Charleston , and followed the professor , known for his liberal books , to Washington , D.C. , when he accepted a government advisory job in the latter part of the Lyndon Johnson administration . When T.C. had become President , and Wanda 's professor had gone back to his university , she had stayed on in Washington . For the last two years she had held a well-paid position as executive secretary to the director of Vaduz Exporters , in nearby Bethesda , Maryland . From the first , Dilman had known that Wanda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her good nature and humor , her well-bred manner , had made it seem incredible that she had not ever been married . As he came to know her better , Dilman had come to understand her avoidance of marriage . Her parents , who had lived in West Virginia , where her father had been a short-order cook , dishwasher , janitor in an all-night diner serving coal miners , had sacrificed much of their comfort , and the futures of her younger brother and sister , to educate and launch her . When first one parent , and then the other , had been hospitalized , and afterward confined to costly sanitarium care , Wanda had accepted full responsibility to support and look after them , not only as daughter but as debtor . She had a burden , and she could not discard it in favor of marriage , for which she was so perfectly suited . But two years ago her father had died , and less than a year before her mother , and at last Wanda had been free to live her own life as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage last spring , Dilman  | knew , and he had not , and it had created , for the first time , an undercurrent of unhappiness between them . She had known that I ' ! he wanted her for his wife . He had known that he needed her . The proposal was up to him , and yet , while he could profess affection and love , articulate his need for her , he could not bring her from upstairs to his flat downstairs as wife . He had thought about it a ! I , thousand times since spring , and had known that the failure was entirely his own . Marriage was an affirmative act , and he had been shackled by countless negative fears . He had tried , time and time again , to narrow in on specific fears , small ones , avoiding the major one , until at last. , he could see what was left and what in himself taunted him with contempt . Wanda Gibson was a mulatto . That was the center of it . As a mulatto , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most communities she could have passed for white . Her hair , while brunette and curling , was soft and long . Her eyes were light brown , her nose delicate and upturned , and her lips and mouth small . Her figure was trim , well hipped but otherwise slender . She considered herself a colored woman , and she lived as a colored woman . But , li for Douglass Dilman , how she regarded herself , and how she approached her life , were not assurances enough . The nagging cowardice within him , that avoided marriage to the one good companion of his life , was his fear of how she would look beside him and how this would affect his political career . With Wanda as his mate , he would appear blacker . With himself as her mate , she would appear whiter . Whatever the facts and truth , it would give the impression of an interracial marriage . It might not cause talk in Washington and in his home state , but on the other hand it might . It was an unnecessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . Or , at least , it might . Dilman 's solution had been to avoid the issue . The weekly platonic meetings had continued , the Senator and his ladylike lady friend , in the Spinger living room , iii the loges of Loew 's Palace Theater , and , ever so occasionally , in the Golden Ox or the Lincoln Inn . Recently , Dlman had become aware , each rendezvous had been less comfortable , less warm and communicative . It was as if they were both present , each desiring the company of the other , but now that she was free of parental commitment and he was temporary presiding chairman of the Senate , there had fallen a thick steel grill between thorn . You could see ; you could hear ; you could not touch . You were two , not one , and might never be one ,  | and Wanda Gibson , for all her evenness of temperament and understanding , had begun to resent this failure in Douglass Dilman . Since his invisible antenna of sensitivity had picked up and recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviewing and brooding over this relationship and his own life . Some weeks ago he had almost arrived at the decision to propose rnarriage , and to the devil with the consequences , if any . After all , lie had asked himself in a practical way , how could he any longer be hurt ? But then he had been sidetracked by his activity , and sham importance , in serving the Senate in the Vice-President 's place . And now , overnight , cruel Destiny had touched him . He had become the President of the United States . The personal choice ahead was clear-cut : should he be James Buchanan or Grover Cleveland ? Buchanan had been the only unmarried President to serve his country . Cleveland had been the only Chief Executive to be married in the White House . When the choice was weighed thus , the scales tipped toward Buchanan . A showy wedding , like Cleveland 's in the Blue Room , before the world and the press , a marriage to a mulatto , a mulatto who might almost be mistaken for white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race . His uncertain position and precarious image , before a broken and divided country , would be worsened . This had been his rationale last night , as he waited , the telephone receiver in his hand , to hear Wanda 's voice . His private decision , he had known , was neither courageous nor honest . It was merely expedient and political . It solved nothing , but simply traded off a personal problem to avoid a more fearsome one . Gazing down at the receiver in his left hand , he had wondered why , under the circumstances , he was trying to speak to her at all , at least at this time . He had no idea what he could say to her , yet somehow , as President of the United States for more than three hours , he had to speak to someone before sleeping and then waking to the terrible fact , and the only one who might care about him , reassure him , was Wanda . As he waited for Wanda , his mind drifted to Mindy . His attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He avoided taking a wife he needed for the same reason that he did not seek out a daughter he loved . He was black and still afraid . " Hello , Doug . " She was calling down to him through a wire from upstairs , and yet she had never been farther away . " Wanda , I wanted to  --  to say good night , before going to sleep . "  | " Doug , it 's overwhelming , the whole thing . What does one say ? Do I congratulate you ? That sounds wrong . " " You commiserate with me , and with the whole country . " No , do n't  --  do n't talk like that . It 's not true . That accident in Frankfurt was horrible . But it happened , Doug , those things happen . Remember how we once talked about what our families were doing the moment that they learned F.D.R. had died ? And how they felt ? They felt the world had come to an end , that they were dying , too , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or to us . Life went on . Maybe differently than it might have had he lived , but not that differently . Well , Doug , T.C. was a good man , I 'm sure , and popular , but he was no F.D.R. , and neither was MacPherson . I know you 'll do as well as or better than either . No one is horn to be the only one to be President . Thousands of men could be President just as well as the one who fought to get the office . If it had to be someone else , I think it could have been no one better than you . " " Wanda , do n't  --  you know me too well for that  --  you know my weaknesses ? " " Everyone has weaknesses , Doug . Be sensible . Stand off and look around . Lincoln had weaknesses , and T.C. had too many to count , and probably dozens we could n't see to count . Of course you have weaknesses , but you 're strong enough to handle the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget what you refuse to remember . With the kind of background you had , all that poverty , how did you get through the university and then law school ? How did you get elected to the House of Representatives four times , and then get into the Senate , and even become its presiding officer ? It took something . Doug , it took very much . I know you , maybe as well as anyone knows you , maybe better , and I am positive the whole country  --  once they get over the shock of the  --  of T.C. 's death  --  they 'll see you for what you are , and they 'll be proud of you . " " Wanda , Wanda  --  you 're doing your best , I know  --  I appreciate it  --  but . Wanda , I 'm black  --  tomorrow morning 230 million Americans are going to wake up and find their President , one they did n't elect , is black . " " That 's true , Doug . . . . Maybe it 'll be a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe , but  --  will they think so ? " " I do n't know , I do n't know what they 'll think and neither do you . I only know what I think . If you go at this as you 've gone at every-  | thing before , with determination , honesty , learning what you have to learn , acting as you believe best , it will be all right . I 'm sure it will work itself out . " " You  --  you sound less certain now , Wanda . " " Do I ? I did n't mean to . I guess I 'm just concerned about you . " " What do you mean ? Tell me exactly what you mean . " " I mean  --  please do n't take it wrong , Doug  --  we know each other too well for that  --  but  --  I mean it would be bad , hurtful , if you started off , went into the White House , feeling you do n't belong , feeling you are less than you should be , feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't misunderstand me , Doug , but ? " " I understand you very well . I 'll try not to be like that . I 'll try hard , but  --  you 're right , I guess  --  I am afraid .... I 'm also afraid for us . That 's on my mind , too . I do n't know what the demands or the expectations of the office are , except what I 've seen and read . I do n't know what it is really like in there . I want to see you , speak to you , more than ever . I  --  I just do n't know  --  will they let me ? " " Doug , nobody owns you . You do n't have to wait for anyone to let you do anything , I mean in your personal life . " " You 're right , Wanda . " " It 's late , dear . You 'd better get some sleep . I  --  I 'll be here . You call me when you can , anytime , I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Anytime . . . . Now sleep , dearest , and know we are all with you . Good night , Doug . " " Good night , Wanda , good night . " After hanging up , he had tried to analyze their talk . She had offered him encouragement , and her language had been warm , and yet , toward the end especially , he had sensed her remoteness . Still , he had thought , as he reached to turn off the bed lamp and then pushed his fatigued body beneath the blanket , she was for him and with him , no matter how disappointed she might be in him , and that was comforting , that was something ; and then he had felt drowsiness , and then he had slept . He finished knotting his knit tie , pulled on the coat of his charcoal suit , and consulted his wristwatch . He was afraid the journey his mind had taken to the events of last night , to the five years with Wanda , had consumed an hour of time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes had passed . It occurred to him that he had made a discovery no scientist had made before him . He had found what traveled faster than the speed of light : memory . The  | trouble was , no matter how fast it traveled , memory never stopped . Determined to retreat no more from the unknown present into the more pleasant past , he left the bedroom and walked briskly into the living room . Lou Agajanian was seated in a chair , under the arch leading into the entry hall , smoking a cigarette . Immediately , the head of the White House Detail leaped to his feet in a pose of civilian attention " Mr. President , " he said , the boss  --  I mean , Mr. Gaynor , he went off to catch a wink of sleep . Another agent , Mr. Prentiss , came in to spell him . lie 's in the kitchen , at the rear service door . " " Fine , fine . " Dilman indicated the chair . " Please relax , Mr. Agajanian . " The Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dilman entered the small dining room ; which overlooked the street . He noticed that instead of his usual yellow breakfast mat and plain pottery dishes , Crystal had set the table with the formal white tablecloth and decorated dishes from the good set . Obviously , for her , this was an Occasion . Amused , he called off toward the kitchen , " Let 's go , Crystal , I 'm here ! " As he sat down , Crystal rushed in and placed his orange juice before him . " Eggs an ' bacon comin ' , Mr. President ! " Before picking up the orange juice , he studied the messages on slips of paper lying before the telephone : his son Julian had phoned from Trafford University ( " Will call you back " ) ; his Senate secretary , Diane Fuller , had phoned from the Old Senate Office Building ( " Has to go out on your business , will call you back " ) ; Secretary of State Eaton had phoned from his house ( " To inquire how you are " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for him early today " ) ; Governor Wayne Talky ( " Will call back shortly " ) . Those were the messages . He guessed that there might have been hundreds more , except that his phone number was unlisted , known only to a select handful of persons . Drinking down the unsweetened orange juice , grimacing at the liquid 's bite , he reached over and brought the pile of newspapers before him . There were five to which he subscribed , two New York City dailies , and three Washington , D.C. , newspapers , one of the latter a Negro press publication . Quickly he examined the headlines streaming across each front page . The sensational New York newspaper read : NATION GASPS ! A NEGRO IS PRESIDENT OF THE USA !  | The moderate New York newspaper read : SENATOR DOUGLASS DILMAN SWORN IN AS PRESIDENT LAST NIGHT : FIRST NEGRO TO ACHIEVE COUNTRY 'S HIGHEST OFFICE The pro-administration Washington newspaper read : CONGRESS AND VOTERS RALLY TO SUPPORT SENATOR DOUGLASS DILMAN The pro-segregationist , Zeke Miller Washington newspaper read : NEGRO SENATOR MADE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CONSTITUTIONALITY ; CITIZENS PROTEST " UNFAIR " RULE OF MAJORITY BY MINORITY ; REPRESENTATIVE MILLER PREDICTS " DISSENSION , DISUNITY , VIOLENCE " The Negro Washington newspaper read : HALLELUJAH ! EQUAL RIGHTS AT LAST ! COLORED PRESIDENT OF SENATE BECOMES PRESIDENT OF US ALL ! WORLD APPLAUDS TRUE DEMOCRACY ! Several things were evident at once . To no one would he be simply a public servant who , by the law of succession , had become President of the United States . To both sides , and the middle , too , he would be the " Negro " who had become President . To the press of his own race he was the colored man , the black Moses , who had come to lead his people out of bondage and save them . To the press of the enemies of his race , as represented by Congressman Zeke Miller 's newspaper chain , he was a black and ugly thing pulled out from under a rock to wreak vengeance on the magnoliascented South , to destroy the Grand Republic by enforcing equality between black godless brutes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their chaste daughters . To the sensational press he was a zoo object , a freak , for the time a story and circulation builder , who could be contended with seriously later . To the press of his Party he was still a senator , to be rallied around until the Party line toward him could be straightened out . To the moderate , conservative , thoughtful press he was  --  he reached for the respected and balanced New York daily again and reread its headline  --  the first Negro to achieve the country 's highest office . Douglass Dilman considered this headline . It was true , and it was fair . But how many others , black or white , would be this reason-  | able ? Slowly his eyes went down the columns of news datelined Washington , D.C. It was all solid reportage of his being sworn in , of the tragedy in Frankfurt that ha 'd led to his being sworn in , backed up by full quotations from Tim Flannery 's release explaining the Presidential Succession Act of 1947 . At the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the reader turn to the main editorial on page sixteen . Dilman put down his fork and knife , took up the New York newspaper , turned to page sixteen , folded it back and then in half . Immediately he found the main editorial headed THE NEw MAN IN THE WHITE HousE , and then he settled in his chair to read what followed : At 10:35 last night ( EDT ) , a new , eligible American male was sworn in as President of the United States , to succeed a popular predecessor who died before fulfilling his full four-year term . In itself , this sudden changing of the guard was neither historic nor unusual . It has happened eight times before in our history . But last night , for the first time , there was a difference . When Presidents Harrison , Taylor , Lincoln , Garfield , McKinley , Harding , Franklin D. Roosevelt , and John F. Kennedy died in office , their unexpired terms were filled out by men who had been their campaign running mates , by men second in line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the electorate , and by men of their own race and color . While public and Congressional acceptance of a second choice , a substitute President , was not always simple and smooth  --  as witness Andrew Johnson 's troubles when he succeeded Abraham Lincoln in 1865 ? at least the transitions were familiar enough to cause no national unrest or uneasiness . However , the overnight accession of Senator Douglass Dilman , to fill the unexpired term of his popular predecessor , presents numerous problems which are deserving of thoughtful consideration . For the first time in our history , not the President 's running mate and campaign colleague , not his second-in-command , not his Vice-President , has taken over his vacant seat , but a relative outsider . For the first time , a senator and not a Vice-President , a legislative officer chosen by his Party colleagues and not the voters , has succeeded to the high office . And , for the first time , let it be stated plainly , a colored man , a member of the Negro race , has been catapulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitherto unused provision of law . There is no reason why , in our view , a Negro should not be President  | of the United States . Were the country educated for him , prepared for him , were they to vote for him spontaneously and elect him to the high office , it would be a significant moment in our history and in world history . All men of goodwill and good heart have worked toward that moment , and hoped for that moment to come . Yet , unfortunately , this schizophrenic land of liberty is still groping its way toward equality . It still disfranchises Negroes , it bars them from gainful employment , it keeps them from decent housing , schooling , public accommodations . We still live in an era of growth as a nation  --  we are making our first toddling steps from uneasy tolerance and decency toward full equality  --  and so we still dwell in an era of constant falls and bruises . Thus , a republic which continues to oppress its ten per cent Negro population , which continues to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself overnight led by one of the minority it has constantly kept in servility . This is a nation that woke this morning and rubbed its eyes in disbelief when it found that a Negro was at its helm , a Negro was its constitutional pilot and leader . In an anguished and shameful period , when Negroes must still be led into schools protected by armed guards , when Negroes must search for segregated washrooms , when Negroes must sit in the rear of municipal buses , in a period such as this , a Negro has become the highest executive in the land , sitting in the seat of Washington , Lincoln , Wilson , becoming every American 's face and voice to the outside world . The problem presented by a Negro in the Presidency is real , and it is grave . The problem is not President Dilman 's problem , but rather , the problem of almost every one of his 230 million fellow Americans . No longer , now , has the United States a half century of grace to grow up to its ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced , today , with the necessity , the imperative necessity , of growing up to its ideal of equality all at once , of accepting a Negro as its leader all at once , of accepting colored men as equal to whites all at once . Failure to attain this maturity , by any state or any member of the democratic community , will be a blow to the country as a whole , will send us reeling backward to the edge of the abyss upon which we teetered toward destruction in the terrible months and days preceding the Civil War . If we go backward , if we fall now , all men here and all mankind everywhere will suffer a death of the soul , as they might suffer a death of the body from a nuclear holocaust . This is not the morning to recapitulate the wrongs that colored men have suffered in this republic , and to plead their case for civil rights so  | long overdue . It is enough to remark that while the Constitution specifically bars anyone from this office who is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-five years of age , it does not bar anyone because the pigmentation of his skin is other than white . A Negro has become President of the United States , and there is no reason on earth why he should not be President . The Southern racists , and the Northern nonthinkers whose prejudices are rarely acted out , can not deny that American Negroes , when given the opportunity , have been as capable as their white brothers in practicing wisdom , or attaining wealth , success , fame . One need only glance at the record . The black hue of their skin did not prevent Jan Matzeliger from inventing the billion-dollar shoe-last machine , did not prevent Frederick Douglass from becoming a brilliant lecturer and writer , did not prevent Booker T. Washington from becoming a great educator , - did not prevent Matthew Henson from helping Peary discover the North Pole , did not prevent Paul Laurence Dunbar from composing his deathless lyrics , did not prevent Marian Anderson , Duke Ellington , Lionel Hampton , Jesse Owens , Joe Louis , Mahalia Jackson , W. C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can the millions awakening this morning prove that Negroes , in the rare instances in the past when they served us in politics and government , acted with less wisdom , courage , judiciousness than did their white brothers . Ebenezer Bassett was our Minister to Haiti . Jonathan Wright was associate justice of the South Carolina Supreme Court . Jefferson P. Long served in the United States House of Representatives . Blanche K. Bruce served in the United States Senate . In more recent times , Robert C. Weaver administered the United States Housing and Home Finance Agency . E. Frederic Morrow worked as administrative aide to President Eisenhower . Ralph J. Blanche served in the United Nations . Andrew Hatcher worked as associate press secretary to President Kennedy . Carl Rowan served as director of the United States Information Agency under President Lyndon Johnson . Douglass 1 ) ilman was President pro tempore of the United States Senate in T.C. 's administration . Each and every one of these leaders was a Negro citizen of the United States . They had earned the right to guide us , help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and defend us in the Revolutionary War , in the War of 1812 , iii the Union Army of Lincoln and Grant , in the First and Second World Wars , in Korea , but because they were part of our whole , part of each of us , with the same stakes and goals . Now one of them , really one of us under the laws devised by the Founding Fathers and since , has become our President . The paramount question is not if Doug-  | lass Dilman is equal to the burdensome responsibility , but if we are equal to our responsibility as Americans . Today we start the first day of President Dilman 's term , his time of trial and our own , the one year and five months that stretch ahead , and we begin with trepidation induced by a survey of cold statistics . Out of 230 million American citizens , there are 23 million Negroes , and it is supposed that most will accept our new President . Based on recent voting figures , excluding Negroes and Southern whites , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is supposed that most of these will cooperate with the new President . On the other hand , there are 47 million whites in the fourteen states of the Solid South , and it is feared that most of them will reject our new President . Again , based on recent voting figures , there are 30 million extreme rightists in the East , North , and West , and it is likely that most of them will refuse cooperation to our new President . What is the guess ? Sixty-three million of us may be behind Douglass Dilman , 77 million of us may be against him . How are we to account for the remaining 90 million of our citizenry , the follow-the-leaders when told whom to follow , the undecideds in countless polls , the great center mass with real faces and real feelings who can go this way or that ? How will they respond to a Negro in the Presidency ? Will they listen to racists or rightists , or will they consider the pleadings of moderates and true democrats ? Or will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negroes ? How have they felt about the racial ferment in this country these last twenty years ? Has something of the aspirations of the new and militant Negro leadership sunk deep into their consciences ? Has more , or less , of the propaganda of segregationists infused their minds ? For the middle majority of us all , knowledge of Negroes firsthand is probably limited  --  limited to the colored cleaning woman , who comes twice a week , limited to the colored baseball player who saves or loses a home game , limited to the garage mechanic , or dime-store clerk , or blues singer seen and heard on a Saturday night . To this white majority , the black man is as unknown as once was the heart of the Dark Continent of Africa . Personally unacquainted with their dark-skinned fellow citizens , knowing of their strife only through the printed page , long avoiding real commitment to this issue because they were busy concentrating on their jobs and raises , shopping and picking the youngsters up at school , these white citizens-are suddenly confronted with the imperative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , this strange morning , the vast uncounted , staring with curiosity or bewilderment , with the first throbbings of pride or resent-  | merit , at a middle-aged senator with kinky hair and dark skin and African face , who has supplanted a leader they chose , and who is now their voice and image in domestic and international affairs . We wait now for their commitment . We pray they , in turn , will wait for their own judgments to stand the tests of self-exploration and sound intelligence . And when they come to that moment of decision very soon , whether to accept President Dilman as one of them , one of us , and cooperate with him for the common good , or whether to reject him as an inferior alien disguised as one of us , we pray they will , on the eve of their personal conunitments , bear one final consideration in mind . Judgment of a colored man in the White House can not and should not be made on whether he will or will not be a wise President , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or T.C. , but whether or not his judges , all the products of independent America , have attained sufficient matt ' city , have grown high enough , have become citizens enough , to permit a fellow human being , experienced and expert in his calling , to reflect and serve them . The immediate future is not in the hands of our first Negro President . It is in our hands , for better or for worse . It seemed an eternity that Douglass Dilman sat at the dining-room table , holding the great metropolitan newspaper which had spelled out , frankly and sensibly , what conditions and judgment waited for him beyond the insular fort of his Negro dwelling and Negro neighborhood . Presently he dropped the newspaper to the table beside the cold breakfast he had hardly touched . He knew that what he had read should have made him feel heartened , even hopeful . Yet the apprehension and fears of the morning shadowed any possible optimism . He thought : Yes , there are men of reason and good will out there ; they exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of traumatic observation , years of compromising and cowering to survive and get along , that men such as the one or ones who created that reasonable editorial were too few . Dilman was not a highly imaginative man , not a soarer , a dreamer , a passionate mover or shaker ; this he knew and had always known . He was an intelligent man . Ile was a formally educated man . He was an experienced man in his chosen field , politics , where knowledge of superficial catch phrases , some forensic talent , an ability to smile , a gift for concession , and a knowledge of facts were enough .  | The hard factual core of his mind reframed the eloquent content of the editorial . If all men in America read it and were moved by it , he could enter the White House without fear . But what was this New York metropolitan newspaper anyway , in truth ? It was a morning paper , the most appreciated by intellectuals in the land . Its total daily circulation was 800,000 . How many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editorial page ? And how many in the broad nation of 230 million would even know of its existence ? It was a pebble trying to fell a Goliath of prejudice  --  a pebble , not a boulder . The telephone to his left rang out , startling him from his brooding . Too quickly , out of guilt for the self-indulgence of self-concern , he shot his hand to the receiver , pulled it toward him , fumbling , almost dropping it into the eggs . " Hello ? " It was a long-distance operator from Trafford , New York . He waited . " Hello  --  hello ? " He recognized the nervous , high-pitched voice at once as that belonging to Julian , his son . " Dad ? " " Yes , Julian . How are you ? " " Me ? Forget about me . My God , Dad , they woke me up in the middle of the night with the news . I could n't believe it . I 'd have called you right away , but I was afraid to wake you up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " " I guess congratulations are in order . May I be one of the first to congratulate you ? " " You certainly may . Thank you , son . " Julian went on excitedly . " Everyone 's thrilled about it , Dad . It 's the talk of the school . Kids are even cutting classes , whole groups roaming the quad , singing , celebrating . " As he went on to describe the activities at Trafford University , Dilman realized that this was the first time in a year that his son had spoken with enthusiasm of the school . Julian had not wanted to go to the Negro university . He had been forced to enroll by his father , and he had never ceased resisting it or complaining about his classmates . Now elation had replaced complaint . " I do n't know that they have so much to feel festive about , " Dilman interrupted . " We lost a fine President . " " Sure we did , Dad , but , my God , ca n't you see ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of . We 've got you there . No more  | lousy uphill fighting . Now you can do it all with a twist of the wrist . They 've got to give in to you . You 're the President ! " He was almost shouting with manic glee . " The shortcut 's been made . We 'll get our rights without ? " " Julian , " he said sternly . Ile had to put a stop to this Julian in Wonderland . " Do n't go around quoting me , or repeating a word I say . This is strictly family , you understand . " " Sure , sure ? " " Nothing has changed that much , at least not for the better . The road ahead is just as long and steep as a day ago . " " Naw , never , Dad . For once , stop being so conservative . You 're too close to the picture . You ca n't see how big it is . I tell you ? " " You 've told me enough , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've got a lot to attend to today . And I 'm sure you have , too . " " Yes , but not today , Dad . My God , they 're treating me here like I was the President . " Instantly the letter from Chancellor Chauncey McKaye , of Trafford University , came to Dilman 's mind . " Has Chancellor McKaye come down to congratulate you ? " Dilman asked with slight sarcasm . " No , not yet , but ? " " I do n't think he will . I think he celebrates honor students . Look , son , we 'd better have a talk ? " " I want to . When are you moving into the White House ? I want pi to come down with the gang and see the inside and ? " " I do n't know yet . I 'll know more about everything in the next few days . I want you here as soon as it is feasible , but without your friends this first time . I have something to discuss with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deflated . " When can I come to Washington ? I 'm free next Tuesday . " " Tuesday , then . You come to the West Wing of the White House . I 'll leave word to let you in . Now , behave yourself and attend your classes . " " Stop worrying , Dad . " He hesitated , and then lowered his voice . " I was thinking about  --  I wonder how she feels this morning . " " Never mind about that , " Dilman said sharply . " See you Tuesday , and thanks for your call . I appreciate it . " After he hung up , Dilman thought about his son 's oblique reference to Mindy , the unmentionable by name , the untouchable , the expatriate from her family and race , and he wondered about her ,  | too . Would he hear from his daughter now ? He knew the barter involved . Would it be worth it to her to abdicate her whiteness for the throne of a Negro President 's daughter ? He guessed the answer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was grateful when the telephone sounded loudly once more . This time the caller was his Senate secretary , Diane Fuller , and because he could hardly hear her and because she was almost inarticulate , he knew that she was among whites . He accepted her congratulations and then learned that she was in Edna Foster 's office in the White House . Diane explained that T.C. 's personal secretary had summoned her to pick up Dilman 's heavy inflow of top-level cables and telegrams , and bring the most important to his apartment , in case he wanted to see the communications early . As Diane began to recite the names affixed to the cables of felicitations and good wishes  --  one from the Premier of the U.S.S.R. , one from His Holiness the Pope , one from the British Prime Minister , one from the President of France , one from the Secretary General of the United Nations , one from President Amboko of Baraza ? Douglass Dilman interrupted her . " Diane , you leave all that right on Miss Foster 's desk , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As for you , go back to my Senate office and take calls . I 'll be in touch with you later . " When he had finished with the telephone , a troubling thought plucked at his sensitivity . The President 's personal secretary , the late President 's secretary , had telephoned the Senate Building to get Dilman 's own colored secretary to pick up the messages for him . Why this roundabout , time-wasting maneuver ? Why had not Edna Foster simply telephoned him herself or brought the messages to him ? That would have been the normal way , and the most efficient . Was it that she had never been to a Negro neighborhood before ? Or was he overreacting ? Was it simply that she had been T.C. 's secretary , and was not only grief-stricken but uncertain about her future role ? Resolving to stop these convolutions of sensitivity , he pushed himself to his feet . He would get his hat , and do what he knew he was avoiding most . He would allow himself to be deposited at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone 's ring caught him . He took up the receiver . This time it was a more distant long-distance operator . She announced a call from Fairview Farm , outside Sioux City , Iowa . She repeated the number she had  | been given to contact . Did she have the correct number ? Dilman assured her that this was the correct number . Suddenly he inquired , " Who is calling here ? " In a schoolteacherish tone , she spelled out the name of the caller . Dilman could not help smiling . It was The Judge himself , and Dilman was delighted . No one , of course , ever called The judge by any other name than that , and Dil-uan , who had been a member of the House when The Judge was the outgoing President of the United States , had known him slightly , and had liked the crusty , outspoken , nearsighted old ex-President enormously . The Judge ? he had been a minor municipal justice of the peace long before he had become a veteran of the Senate and an American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected in his time that he had campaigned without vacillating on issues , with astonishing candor , without selling himself to any man or bloc ( since there was no need to , because his candidacy was considered hopeless ) . When he had won the Presidency in a landslide , putting two polls and three magazines out of business , The Judge had come to the office as his own man . The mandate to speak as he pleased , as well as the fact that he had reached an age when he did not give a damn about ambition and had no hopes for a second term , had made him one of the most individual , independent , and refreshing Chief Executives in modern times . When he liked a man , he liked him if he was black or white , a member of the Party or the opposition , a brain or a heel , and he said so in short expletives , and his enemies fulminated , and the nation adored him . In the three meetings that The Judge had had with Dilman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Party conferences , he had made it clear that he liked Dilman as a person . No patronizing Rastus-boy attitude . IIe liked Dilman and he said so , and Dilman liked anyone who liked him and was flattered . " Put him on  --  put him on ? " he found himself telling the Iowa operator . The receiver emitted a sound like that of cylinders misfiring , and suddenly The Judge 's nasal voice could be heard . " Mr. President Dilman , are you there ? " " Yes , judge , how are ? ? " " From one old bastard who 's hung in the public stocks to another about to be pilloried in the same place , I want to wish you well . Doug , I want you to go in there , keep your left up high , chin tucked in , and belt them straight from the shoulders . No matter what you hear , no matter what you see , just remember you 're the  | boss , you 're not Uncle Tom . You think what you think , speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you give them hell . Remember that , young man . Except for those Confederates who still think old Jeff Davis is President , you got your Party right behind you from this day on . And those that are n't behind you , you tell me and I 'll whomp them into line . Just calling for me and the Missus to wish you the best on the first day , because you and I and the Missus know you need it . " He began to cough , and Dilman waited , beaming like an idiot , and when the coughing ceased , Dilman spoke . " Judge , I appreciate this , I do , deeply . I do n't know how to thank you . " " I 've not done anything for you yet , young man , so do n't thank me till I do . But I 'll tell you what . Me and the Missus are living out here in the middle of nowhere , like Thoreau at the Pond , and all we got is cows and fresh air and time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So you listen , young fellow , and you remember , if you ever need me at all , not money but advice or a helping hand  --  both untaxable and both which we got plenty of out here  --  you come around to me and we 'll have a farm breakfast and talk , and set you straight , or if you want and I can move my bones , I 'll come up there to you . Remember that . Promise ? " " I wo n't forget it , Judge . " " Just one more thing , Douglass , and it 's a favor . " He paused , and then he said testily , " I do n't give a damn if you turn that White House upside down and inside out , but one thing I do n't want you to do  --  do n't you dare move my portrait out of the Green Room ! Good luck , Mr. President , and God bless you ! " Returning the receiver to its cradle , Dilman chuckled . There were more than decent editorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Judge . The morning appeared brighter . Again the telephone was ringing . Dilman glanced at his wristwatch . It was a quarter to ten . He picked up the receiver impatiently . " Yes ? " " Good morning , Mr. President . This is Wayne Talley . I 'm in the White House with Secretary of State Eaton . We have some urgent matters  --  routine , but they have to be settled  --  to discuss . Are you intending to come over here this morning , or would you prefer that we visit you ? " " I 'm on my way to the White House right now , " said Douglass Dilman.  | He hung up , and it occurred to him that this might be the last telephone call he would receive on his private unlisted number . He was going to another home with many telephones , connections to every state and to all countries , and his telephone number would be known to everyone in the world . He started out of the dining room to find his hat , and to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would try to live in a new house and a new community that was not meant for a Negro but for a man of all the people , because only such a man could serve as President of the United States  --  that is , a man who was certain that he was a man , and nothing less . DumNC Governor Wayne Talley 's brief conversation with Dilman , Arthur Eaton had sat on one of the two black sofas of the Presidential reception room , the Fish Room it was called after the mammoth sailfish that T.C. had had mounted and hung on one wall , staring up at the square skylight in the ceiling . Arthur Eaton had hardly heard the conversation , so absorbed was he in his own musings . Persistently his mind had dwelt upon the loss of T.C. , his closest public friend  --  in fact his only friend , since he was a person who had never encouraged personal or intimate relationships with other men . Eaton had been in government , a career diplomat , as far back as he cared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when there was money , would have been horrified at anything in government under diplomacy . To run for office , to depend upon others for largess , was unthinkable . As a consequence , Eaton had never considered running for any office , although there had been opportunities . His father , before his death  --  which occurred almost simultaneously with his loss of wealth  --  had arranged to put him into diplomacy , and in diplomacy he had been throughout his years . He could recollect many of his previous posts with ease . There had been the minor beginning as a representative to UNESCO in Paris . There had been the appointment as a delegate to the still growing United Nations in New York . There had been three ambassadorships to three corners of the globe . There had been special troubleshooting assignments , where poise and firmness and keen intellect were wanted , from Eisenhower , Kennedy , and Lyndon  | IOlinson . There had been a period of dismay , almost ennui , when the assignments seemed to be blurring , each one resembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calfskin briefcases and same treaties and same Oriental or Semitic or Asian or European countenances uttering the restrained semantics of upper-echelon diplomatic negotiation . Eaton relished protocol , fine manners , the limited games of wits , and yet he had once become bored by it all . It was a period ( luring which he had felt trapped on a treadmill . Worse , as oppressive , was the fact that he and Kay had lived beyond his means , because this was the way they had been taught to live , and more and more he had become dependent upon her inherited fortune . In his career at that time , not so long ago , he had possessed no hope for change or promotion , and in his personal life he had enjoyed no freedom . It was T.C. who had rescued him , and offered him his greatest hope . He had enjoyed T.C. 's vigor and boundless extroversion since their college years . While their paths had crossed occasionally , Arthur Eaton had watched T.C. 's political fortunes rise from afar . He had observed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more importance . He had , with admiration mingled with envy , observed T.C. become a national figure . He was not surprised when the convention had nominated T.C. as the Party 's standard-bearer on the third ballot , but he was surprised when Tim Flannery had telephoned from St. Louis to report that T.C. needed his assistance in the campaign and wanted him to fly out immediately . At the time , Eaton had been between missions , momentarily free of an assignment , and he had gone to T.C. at once . To Arthur Eaton , in that St. Louis hotel suite , T.C. had been as he had always been , only more so , more confident , more exuberant , more stimulating . T.C. had presented his proposition directly . As the Party 's candidate , he was well-enough versed in domestic affairs to handle himself properly . But , T.C. had admitted disarmingly , he 'd had little opportunity to be involved in international problems , and on the subject of foreign affairs he was a dolt , and he needed help and advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence from the Department of State , and join T.C. 's campaign for the Presidency as adviser on foreign affairs and part-time speech writer . Although the idea of accompanying anyone on a grueling campaign junket , leaving air-conditioned rooms and polished tables for grubby , poorly lit hotel rooms , half-cooked food , smelly , disheveled  | local politicians , revolted Arthur Eaton , he had accepted without hesitation . There had been two reasons for his immediate acceptance . One was the chance to get away from Washington , from Kay and her tiresome social friends , from work that was suffocating him , and the other ( and more exciting ) reason was T.C. 's promise . " Arthur , you help me win , and I 'll see that you have yourself a Cabinet post , not selling stamps or worrying about squaws , but a big one , the biggest . You help me now , and you can help me run this country and most of the world next year . " It had happened exactly as T.C. had promised that it would . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and T.C. had become the President-elect , Arthur Eaton had answered the ringing telephone in Georgetown . The caller had been T.C. himself . No sooner had Eaton congratulated him than T.C. had boomed out , " Arthur , you got any enemies in the Senate ? " Eaton could think of none , not real enemies . Then T.C. had said , " Think they 'll give consent on your appointment ? " And Eaton had asked , " To what ? " And then T.C. , with a delighted laugh that was almost a shout , had bellowed across the wire , " To Secretary of State , my friend . You are the first in my Cabinet , and welcome to it ! " So he had become Secretary of State Eaton , and with Talley trotting between T.C. and himself , he had assisted the President in running the country . Those had been adventurous and stimulating days , those days of the two years and seven months gone by , and they had been his Fountain of Youth . Not only had each morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Eaton had found the independence to shake off the yoke of money that held him captive to his wife . He had been enabled to ignore her disdain , her snobbery , her petty values , her Social Register crowd and her avantgarde artist salon . He had , indeed , been able to plead devotion to something that mattered more , survival of his country . This had been the same shield he had always been able to hold up to fend off Kays barbed anger . Her teelmi*lin had not varied from its pattern in the past ; it had only intensified . She had continued to hack away at his masculinity . When she found that she could no longer bring hint down , as she had always succeeded in doing in the past , she had begun to increase her trips away from Washington . She had permitted herself to he seen with her endless bright young men in public . Eaton had rarely speculated on what she might be doing with her companions in private . But more and more , freed of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of attentive and  | appreciative young Washington women , the single ones . There had been but two short-lived affairs  --  for he was always aware of the dangers  --  but they had been gratifying enough to remind him that he was a person still capable of enjoying love and companionship , and that he was more than his wife had tried to make him . All of this pride and pleasure he owed to the patronage and friendship of T.C. , whom he had revered as a friend and respected as a leader . Twenty-four hours ago their future had seemed glowing . There were years of their joint rule ahead of them  --  the remainder of this term , and the almost certain second term . Twentyfour hours ago Eaton 's resurrection as an individual , a very important person , had been secure . And then , shockingly , with the crumbling of that ancient Palace in Frankfurt , his high hopes and good prospects had crumbled , too . And so he knew that his mourning was not only for the loss of his friend , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endless tragic night in Georgetown , following the swearing in of Dilman as President , he had received and listened to or overheard the members of T.C. 's bereft team and the leaders of the Party . Most of the chatter had been about how to preserve the unity of the Party , now that a Negro was its head . There had been a little talk , he remembered , about preserving the unity of the nation as well . Too , there had been talk , mostly in Southern accents , about challenging the constitutionality of the 1947 Act of Succession , and there had been talk , in harder accents , about reviving some aspect of the old 1867 Tenure of Office Act , which had once enabled the Senate to try to restrict a President from removing officers appointed to his Cabinet . In short , Eaton remembered , the concern had not been about Dilman 's ability to handle the office , and how he must best be guided , but rather about how to balk him or , failing in that , to control him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not he tainted black and so that those present might not lose their jobs to colored men and to bleeding-heart Negro-lovers . Through the night , Arthur Eaton had not permitted himself to be drawn into these discussions . His foresight had suffered from emotional cataracts . He had thought only of the immediate consequences of the fateful night , of the condition of the country and himself now , in the present , without T.C. as mentor . When his living room bar and then his library had emptied , and he had sought sleep , he had still not fastened on the full realization that even though another , by default , had become President , this other must  | be made to understand that it was still T.C. 's country and T.C. 's government and that any successor was there merely as a custodian of T.C. 's ideas and ideals , which Eaton himself might continue to spell out and present . Not until now , in the Fish Room of the White House  --  a room , like the Oval Office , restored by T.C. to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to Talley on the telephone , after reviewing all that he had reviewed in his head , finally settled on the idea of what must be done . He had a role , after all , and perhaps now it was more important than it had been before . He must ignore every one of those harebrained schemes about blocking Dilman from the Oval Office , or obstructing the lamentable Negro . He must devote himself , Eaton decided , to keeping T.C. as alive as he had ever been . Only thus could their United States be saved , and , parenthetically , only thus could Arthur Eaton have a continuing , meaningful life . he sat straight on the sofa , saw that Wayne Talley was standing at the desk near the door , making notes on a sheet that lay beside the quaint early typewriter once used by Woodrow Wilson . " What are you up to , Wayne ? " he inquired . " Dilman 's on his way in . He 's an absolute amateur . I 'm not saying he 's stupid  --  hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he 's ignorant of what really goes on , and of things that have to be done . It kills me when I think of it . The Majority Party senators caucus every time there 's a new Congress in the Conference Room of the Senate Office Building to select a temporary presiding officer to sit up there with the gavel and pound it . The idea is to select one of their own as a substitute or alternate for the Vice-President when he 's out of town . Nine times out of ten , they cast their caucus vote for the member among them who has seniority . There 's no rule about it , but it 's a kind of gesture of courtesy , a custom , to select the senator who 's had the most years of service . That 's why Rydberg had the spot so long . Papa Methuselah ' they called him . Then his doctors make him quit , so the Senate needs a replacement , what with Porter traveling all the time . They 've got to caucus again . So what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Detroit , Chicago , Memphis , Dallas , all of it from Negroes , with those protest marches and boycotts worsening  --  so a couple of smart guys get the big political brainstorm , let 's give the honorary presiding post to a Negro , a democratic gesture , and shut up those demonstrators , prove to them we mean well . So Senator Selander , the senior member , who  | normally would have become President pro tempore , seconds the suggestion . That makes it okay . So Selander steps out of the caucus , phones me , and tells me to pass it on to T.C. to find out if he approves . Well , T.C. was so damn busy that day he did n't give a hoot who held that unimportant President pro tempore of the Senate job , so he said okay , maybe it 'll look good for the Party , let them do what they think best . So the Party caucus elects Douglass Dilman , and puts the resolution naming him to the whole Senate . Then , a routine thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate , Senator Riggins , and a roll call is held and the opposition amendment voted down . Then the original resolution on behalf of Dilman is put to a voice vote , and the ayes have it , and Dilman has that idiotic do-nothing post . Who in the hell would know that the Vice-President would drop dead soon after that ? Who in the hell would imagine that the fourth in line of succession could ever become President of the United States ? In fact , who in the hell , on that day they routinely caucused and voted , even knew that the President pro tempore of the Senate was the fourth in line ? I always thought it was the Secretary of State . I thought it was you , Arthur , not that it mattered a damn at the time . So for political and publicity reasons we put that poor Party hack in there , and we had our showcase colored man up there for all to see , a man with no qualifications for leadership whatsoever ? " " How do you know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in the House four terms , in the Senate two terms , and what has he ever done or instigated ? " said Talley heatedly . " He was sent to Washington because of the temper of the times , and given an honorary gavel in the Senate because of the times , and then a once-in-a-thousand accident happens , and blooey , we 're stuck with a tenth-rater whose presence means potential trouble , and plenty of it . " He lifted his hands to the ceiling . " The fourth in line becoming President  --  I repeat , Arthur , who could 've imagined it ? " " It was always a possibility , " said Eaton . " I was reading this morning that what happened now might very well have happened during the last six weeks of 1961 . At that time Speaker Rayburn was dead , and not replaced , and had President Kennedy been assassinated then , and Vice-President Johnson with him , we would have had the fourth in line , President pro tempore of the Senate Hayden , as President of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone would have been better than Dilman . " " Well , if he does n't work out , " said Eaton , " you and your senator friends have only yourselves to blame . As an expediency , you played politics instead of exercising judgment , and you did it once too often . " " Arthur , do n't lecture me from hindsight . We always play politics . That 's our business . Politics  --  why , that 's not necessarily a dirty word . It implies bargaining , giving and taking , it means tuning in on the times , doing things people want even when you 're not sure it 's best for them . More often than not , politics produces good results . And usually , when we play politics , we guess right , and what happens is right not only for us here but for most of the people out there . This time , this once , though ? " IIe shook his head sadly . " Well , like I said , we were dealing with a minor decision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who in the hell knew that it would lead to this ? " " Yet it has led to this , " said Eaton . " I suggest that we forget the past , and consider what is to be done in the present . This is the time to be realistic , to make the best of a  --  a difficult situation . " He paused and considered Talley . " I believe T.C. would have wanted that . " Talley 's cross-eye jumped , and he swallowed , as ever cowed by the mention of T.C. 's name . " Yes , I guess you 're right , " he said . He came away from the desk , rattling the sheet of paper in his hand . " Well , you can see that I , personally , am trying to make the best of it . I 'm trying to get up a reasonable list of the first duties Dilman must discharge . God knows how well he 'll be able to manage them . " " Wayne , certainly he will expect expert counsel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office became too big for one man . After all , what are the demands on the President today ? He is Chief Executive , overseeing the execution of our laws , exercising important powers of appointment and removal . He is chief of state , national host to an endless stream of native and foreign visitors . He is Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy and Marines and Air Force , with the Pentagon dangling from his civilian lapel . He is arbiter of both Houses on Capitol Hill , able to influence Congressional activity , able to nullify its accomplishments by veto . He is Ambassador to the world , making deals with international leaders , ironing out treaties , selecting foreign diplomat puppets ,  | using my own Department of State as little more than a computer . And that , Wayne , is but the start of it , for any President . Consider his lesser jobs  --  he runs his political party , he molds public opinion , he sees that his voice is heard in the United Nations , he acts as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bigbusiness monopoly . " Arthur Eaton saw that Talley was becoming impatient , and he smiled . " Forgive a resume of what you are already too well acquainted with , but this is a morning in which to remember the facts of a President 's life . What lone man , in our complex age , can perform as so many men at one and the same time ? There 's enough here to give Hercules a nervous breakdown . Every modern President knows that . Roosevelt , Truman , Eisenhower , Kennedy , Johnson knew that , and delegated power to specialists . The only one who tried to go it alone was The Judge , and that lasted about one year , and his cranky ego put him in such a hole that it took several hundred experts to dig him out . Why , T.C. once told me our method of electing and depending on one President was as outmoded as the horse-and-buggy , that what this country needed today was the election of a board of Presidents , at least five serving at once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next-best thing . He took on you , Wayne , after you lost your election , and myself , and a half-dozen others of the Party as assistant Presidents , and it worked nicely , very nicely . " Talley sniffed . " Great , Arthur , I know that . You know that . Maybe every schoolboy knows that . But does our new Mr. President know that ? " " He may . If he does not understand delegation of power , I think he will come to understand it within a week . " " I wish I could be as sure of that as you , Arthur . We 're not dealing with an ordinary man . We 're dealing with a colored man , the product of a race that 's been pushed around for a century or more , and is used to being told what to do , and resents it . You give someone like that power , the power to do the pushing , and he may not want to let go of one inch of it . He can ruin us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up . " You may be right . On the other hand , it is quite possible that his color , the history of his racial background , can work to our benefit . Based on what I know of his performance on Capitol Hill , he is a timid and uncertain man , a good listener , orthodox and agreeable in every way . Last night I asked Senator Selander to read me Dilman 's vot-  | ing record for this last session . He went along with T.C. and the Party on every piece of major legislation . I think that augurs well for all of us . " " Arthur , he was n't President of the United States then . " " No , but now that he is , he may be more frightened and eager for our help than ever before . At least , I choose to think so . I can not fire up enthusiasm for those extremist challenges and measures being proposed to void I ) ilman 's Presidency or to hamper him if he legally remains our President . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no shred of evidence that he will be uncooperative . I believe we must make him see matters as T.C. saw them and would have acted upon them in the future . If we succeed , it 'll be a certainty that we will survive the rest of the term unscathed . And I think the time to begin our guidance is right now , from this moment onward . " IIe pointed to the sheet of paper in Talley 's hand . " Tell me what is on Dilman 's agenda . " Still troubled , Talley sat on the edge of the sofa , and consulted the scribblings on the sheet of paper he held before him . " Let me see  --  umm  --  he signed the proclamation for T.C. 's funeral and the period of national mourning last night , did n't he ? Yes , I remember . Well , now , he 'll have to go over and meet the funeral plane tomorrow . " " I wish Grover Illingsworth would take care of that , " said Eaton . Then he added , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the services in the White House , and the funeral itself . He 's the best Chief of Protocol we 've ever had , but he 's even better at ? at delicate affairs like this . I 've already packed him off in T.C. 's jet to bring Hesper back from Arizona . " Talley brought his head up sharply . " What about Hesper ? Should Dilman see her ? " Eaton did not reply at once . He thought of Hesper , T.C. 's gracious wife , now a widow , with one fatherless son , isolated in the summer home in Phoenix . Ile had already spoken to her . She was taking it courageously , as might be expected of a woman of her background . Like his own Kay , she was Social Register and independently wealthy , but unlike his own Kay , she was well-balanced and friendly . Passionately devoted to her child , her numerous charities , she would survive her loss well . " I do n't know , Wayne , " Eaton said . " Perhaps Dilman should pay his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be uncomfortable for both of them . We  | have a day or two . Let me think about it . " Iie waved his hand at Talley 's notes . " Let 's go on . " " IIe has to swear in the White House staff ? " " This afternoon . " " ? and fill some sudden vacancies , mostly female secretaries , Southern . " " I see . Fine , Edna can begin screening applicants . " Talley went back to his notes . " Tim Flannery says the press reports show considerable concern . The country 's had a bad jolt . " He looked up . " Maybe it would allay everyone 's fear if they could have a look at him , see that he 's harmless . I thought we could prepare a short , rather self-effacing speech for him , and put him on the television networks ? " " No , " said Eaton firmly . " Too soon . His appearance might inflame rather than soothe . Let 's try to keep him out of sight for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dilman the government has not been disrupted , that business is going on as usual . " " What about letting him address a Joint Session of Congress ? Truman did it after F.D.R. 's death . " " He did it over his colleagues ' protests . No , Wayne , I do n't like that either . I still say keep him close to his desk for a while , until everyone settles down . " " Well ? " " Arrange to have him lunch tomorrow with selected leaders of the Senate and House . " " Excellent , " said Talley , making a note of it . " What about the Cabinet ? Shall I summon all hands for a meeting today ? " Eaton shook his head . " Not today . Not tomorrow , either . " " Wo n't it look funny if he does n't ? " Eaton licked his lower lip . " I do not want him running a Cabinet lit meeting until we 've had a chance to brief him thoroughly . We 've first got to inform Dilman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will know how to handle himself . " He sat up straight . " I 'll tell you what to do , Wayne  --  beginning this afternoon , and during the next few days , have the various Cabinet members drop in on courtesy calls , but make sure none of them discusses business . As to Dilman , for his part he must request each one to remain in office and to serve him as each served T.C. " " What if he objects or has reservations ? " " He wo n't resist , Wayne . He does n't know them , and he does need a knowledgeable Cabinet at once . He has n't had time to con-  | sider anyone else . Oh yes , be sure to remind him that after F.D.H. died , Harry Truman did just this , asked each member of Roosevelt 's Cabinet to stay on . And Lyndon Johnson did the same . Very well , what next ? " " At least a dozen ambassadors have applied this morning for appointments . Ambassador Rudcnko wants to discuss resumption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . " " Then the Ambassador from Baraza , Nnamdi Wamba , is most anxious ? " " I 'll have Jed Stover stall him . I 'm flying someone over to Baraza tomorrow to sit down with President Amboko . I want to do what T.C. was intending to do  --  pave the way for a settlement with the Russians by making the Africans ease up on their Communists in return for our ratifying the African Unity Pact . I want to feel Amboko out . When we are ready , we can tell Dilman how to behave with the Barazans . " " Then the Indian Ambassador and ? " " Limit them to courtesy calls , too . No official business until next week . Is that enough to keep Dilman occupied ? " Talley nodded . " Of course , but there 's ? " The knocking on the door behind them made both of them turn . " Yes ? " Talley called out . The door opened and Edna Foster poked her head into the room . " Secretary Eaton , since it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a call from Miami Beach for you . It 's Mrs. Eaton . Can you take it now ? " Eaton hesitated and then quickly said , " Yes , certainly . Thank you , Miss Foster . " " Line two , please , " Edna said , and closed the door . Eaton rose stiffly from the sofa and crossed to the telephone . " Arthur , if you 'd like to be alone ? " Talley called after him . " Stay where you are . " Eaton punched a plastic key on the telephone and brought the receiver to his ear . " Kay dear , how are you ? " He listened to her soprano mockery of his greeting . " ' Kay dear , how are you ? ' Oh , my , somebody should hear you . They 'd think you had just cone off the tennis court . IIow do you do it , Arthur ? How do you stand calm and collected in a massacre ? I thought you 'd be in the middle of a wake , at least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your poor T.C. Does n't anything drive you to drink , Arthur ? " " You may succeed where others have failed , darling . " Her laughter rattled through the receiver , and then there was a pause , and she came on more soberly . " I heard it when we all drove back to the hotel before midnight . They broke in on the music , every station . Quite an uproar down here in Florida . And this morning , too . The colored waiter would n't even take a tip for breakfast . Got enuff for one day , ma'am , ' he said . And the whites down in the lobby , glowering and complaining and nigger-hating all over the place . It 's enough to scare you . Know anywhere to hide , Arthur ? Or do n't you run scared any more ? " " Not any more , Kay . " " That the best you can do , Arthur ? You sound so restrained . Is there someone in the room with you ? " " Yes , there is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should it , now ? We 're public property , we belong to all ages . Did you know Reb Blaser 's column is syndicated ? Indeed it is . I read about us right down here in the sand . I hear the Eatons are heading for the divorce court . Should I believe everything I read ? " " Cut it out , Kay . FIe was gunning for bigger game in that column . " " I should think there 's no bigger game than you personally right now , my dear one . What 's the saying  --  ah  --  you 're a heartbeat away from the Presidency , I read . " " I have n't had time to think about it . " " Well , I have , Arthur . I have nothing but time these days . I could hardly fall asleep last night speculating about it . I kept thinking how close it had been . What if that Negro  --  whatever his name is ? had been with T.C. and MacPherson in Frankfurt ? Why , you 'd be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you could n't divorce a First Lady , could you ? Could you , Arthur ? Has it ever been done ? " At last her chiding anger had penetrated his control . " Kay , stop it . I 'm busy right now . We can ? " Her voice was suddenly serious . " Arthur , do you want me to come home now ? If you need me ? " He thought how much he had needed her how many times in the past , but now he needed only peace of mind . He had a desire to tell her so , but he was aware that Talley was in the room , and he  | restrained himself . " Finish your vacation , Kay . That would be best for both of us . " " Drop dead , " she said calmly , and hung up . He was left with the receiver still uplifted , without the chance to say good-bye , always an embarrassment when others were in the room . He made a lame pretense . " Be well , Kay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he returned the receiver to its place . He observed that Talky was too busily occupied making notes on that crowded single sheet of paper . He was sure that Talley had guessed what had gone on between Kay and himself , and he was even more resentful of Kay for baiting him when she knew he was not alone . Remaining near the telephone , Eaton inquired , " What about the rest of Dilman 's agenda ? " " Oh , " Talley said , sitting erect , as if he had been deeply absorbed in work and unaware that the telephone call had ended . Quickly he began to announce what was left for Dilman to do . " He 'll have to reply to a ton of foreign dispatches from heads of state . Maybe something short and sweet , to instill confidence in them . Perhaps a longer cable in response to Premier Kasatkin . I think Tim Flannery and the two of us should get to work immediately helping Dilman draft a dignified , somewhat ambiguous statement to the press telling them that he enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the American people who voted T.C. into office , and that the ship of state is still T.C. 's ship , and he is only temporarily at the helm , but will do his best ? " " Good , " said Eaton . " Inform Dilman and Flannery we 'll meet at three today . " " Next on the schedule ? " The telephone beside Eaton rang out . Tie picked it up , praying that it was not Kay again . It proved to be Edna Foster from across the hall . She reported that Congressman Zeke Miller and one of his assistants were in the press lobby . Miller had said that it was imperative that he see both Eaton and Talley . He had promised not to take up more than a few minutes . " What should I say to him ? " Edna Foster asked . " Tell him we 're crowded for time , but ? " He weighed the necessity of seeing Congressman Miller , whom he found gauche and distasteful , but then he realized that if he were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a politician as well as a diplomat . " Very well , Miss Foster , send him in. "  | Ile moved toward the corridor door . " Who is it ? " Talley inquired . " Zeke Miller wants to see us for a few minutes . I suppose we have to . " " Absolutely , " said Talley . " He packs a lot of power , especially right now . " Eaton opened the door , noticing that the " In Use " sign still hung from its peg , and then , as if on cue , Representative Zeke Miller , thin briefcase tucked under his arm , charged into the Fish Room , shaking hands with Eaton , and with Talley , who had come to his feet . Then Miller introduced the gangling young man with thick spectacles and flabby lips and overloaded brown briefcase , who had followed him inside , as one Casper Wine . Zeke Miller circled the Fish Room , hot with perspiration , and imperiously ordered his assistant to a chair . " Sit down over there , Casper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wine is the goldarn smartest young constitutional lawyer on the Hill . Does a lot of homework for those of us on the House Judiciary Committee . " Miller swung away , yanking a blue handkerchief from his hip pocket . He brought it to his nose , honked into it , and then , balling up the handkerchief , wiped the perspiration from his forehead , face , and neck . Eaton watched Miller 's activity , these nervous gyrations , with growing distaste . On those occasions when he had been thrown together with Miller , he had always left feeling that he would have been more comfortable with a pit viper . For one thing , Eaton found the Southern Congressman 's appearance repulsive . Not that Miller was technically ugly , Eaton conceded , but his aspect was that of the bigot incarnate . Miller was not quite short , was wiry , and was perpetually in motion . There was something meanly threatening about him , like a coiled spring ready to tear loose , explode , and shred anyone within range . Miller was sernibald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny gray eyes , and an almost lipless mouth that continually worked over discolored teeth . His small frame , like his small mind , was tough and supple . his suits were expensive but garish . Neither his father 's textile money nor his inheritance from his mother had given him polish . His years away from the Deep South had modified his Dixie accent which , it was said in the cloakrooms , he turned on at will during electioneering years . When taking to the hustings down home , traveling the red clay roads and magnolia groves , Zeke Miller reverted to being the corn-  | plete " Southroner , " and the voice that twanged away like the plucked strings of a banjo on the floor of the House became softer , rounder , as its rich mellifluousness inveighed against the Communist-African conspiracy " to undermine America by reducing us to one mongrelized family , and thereby bringing on the Biblical Armageddon which will wipe our Christian government from the earth . " America 's hope , Miller often said , was in containing the spread of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the carriers and spreaders of destruction to their native Africa . In his infrequent cheerier moments of oratory , Miller was given to attributing his jokes to his father 's decrepit green parrot , or to revising suitable quotations from the Old Testament . He would not forget that his grandpappy , Braxton Z. Miller , had owned slaves , and they had been peaceable and grateful , and " the Nigra 's lot " had been the better for this paternal segregation . " As the Prophets have told us , " Miller often liked to say , " ' Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together . ' " " Now Zeke Miller had finished drying himself , and was folding his handkerchief and returning it to his hip pocket . " I tell you , " he muttered , " those reporters out there sure downright bugged me . Trying to make me out a Bilbo or worse . Anything for a story . They sure can be mighty rough boys . " " You should know , Zeke , " Talley said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aw , no , that 's not true , Governor , " Miller said . " The few newspapers my Dad and I control , they do n't amount to a hill of beans . " For the first time Miller became conscious of Eaton 's stare . He half faced Eaton . " I 've got too many more serious matters on my head than to bother about my newspapers . Just for the record , Mr. Secretary , I had no part in what that goldarn fool , Reb Blaser , put in our papers . It got me sore as could be , and I told Reb off good , and said if he picks on my friends once more with goldarn scandal rumors , I 'll see that he winds up on one of those nigger newspapers . Just so there 's no misunderstanding , Mr. Secretary , I 've got nothing against you and your lady . I 'm for you . I 'm for all of T.C. 's team and everyone in our constitutional government . Fact is , I 'm closer on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , you 've got my word , no more subverting rumors . " " You 're protesting too much , Congressman , " said Eaton , " and it 's not necessary . I take your word it was a mistake . I accept your promise that it wo n't happen again . I 've quite forgotten the whole  | incident . You 're right , there are more important matters to contend with now . " Miller 's mouth cracked into a smile , and his nicotine-stained teeth were revealed . " There 's more important things on my mind , too . If you sit down , I 'll be quick , I 'll give you a report on what 's been going on up on the Hill to save this poor country . " Eaton and Talley eased themselves down on the sofa , but Zeke Miller stayed on his feet , snapping open his briefcase , extracting a wad of clipped papers . " Know what this is ? " he asked , holding up the papers while dropping his briefcase . " This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the greatest humiliation and danger of our century  --  against having an ignorant nig possum politician dirtying the White House and shoving us around . " Eaton did not suppress his displeasure . He knew that Miller used the words " nigger " and " nig " when trumpeting for white votes in the South , but , like most of his colleagues , he confined himself to Negro ( " Nigra , " his accent made it ) in the public arena of the House . Now he had slipped back to " nigger , " and this , Eaton decided , came from inner fury . " Congressman Miller , " Eaton found himself saying , " President Dilman is not shoving anyone around . He has n't had the time to do so , even if he had the desire . " " You wait , you just wait and see , " Miller shot back . " Before you can turn around , you 'll find yourself staring down at a nigger Cabinet , with every administrative aide and every ambassador a black jigaboo , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his servants and white girls for his secretaries . That 's what all of them have been waiting for . " Miller belched , strutted in a tight circle , and came to roost before Eaton and Talley once more . " For a minute , forget about the side issues . I 'm worried sick about the big issues . See here in my hand , tallies of the telegrams that have come flooding in to Hankins and myself and the rest of us , and not all from the South , either . I 'll leave them for you to read . Over two thousand telegrams since last night , demanding we keep that Dilman out of office and protect our country . Now , do n't give me any cool racist and segregationist back talk , because this is bigger than that . Almost three years ago the people of this glorious country heard the issues and elected the man they wanted to represent them , and suddenly they find themselves saddled with someone they never wanted who plumb hates their guts . I call that legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm  | willing to shout it from the rooftops , if that Nigra Dilman is allowed to sit in T.C. 's chair , we 're in for rebellion . Inside a month we 'll be wading through blood from white and nigger bodies . Letting this stranger be foisted upon us disrupts our unity and progress , degrades us in the eyes of the world , and promises corruption and ruin . " He paused , his pinpoint eyes darting from Eaton to Talley , and then he hiccuped and went on . " I know what you 're both thinking , or maybe I do n't , hut I 'm no red-neck , I tell you . I 'm an educated , progressive legislator who wants what is right . Sure I was raised to believe that we have our place , and the niggers have their place , and that 's the way Jehovah arranged it . But I 'm a Party man , and always will he , so help me . When the Party had to bow to the Supreme Court and force us to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what I 'll still do . I eat with niggers , and ride with them , and let my youngsters enter the same school with them , because that 's the law . Good enough . I 've done everything with niggers , like it or not , but goldarn it , there 's sure one thing I wo n't do  --  I wo n't let an African black man sit in the chair where General Washington sat , and try to rule me . Maybe if one day it was the wish of the electorate out there , black and white , I 'd go along . If he was voted in by popular vote , I 'd live with it . But the way it is now  --  no , never ! " Miller had the blue handkerchief out again , and angrily mopped his wet face . Talley wrung his hands nervously . " Zeke , he was voted into the Senate ? " " By damn Northern Communists , " interrupted Miller . " Nevertheless , he was voted into the Senate , and the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the line of succession . I do n't see what you can do about it . " " Aha ! " exclaimed Miller . " That 's why I brought Casper Wine over here . He knows the Constitution so thoroughly , he could 've signed it with Hancock . A group of us who are concerned about what 's happening to our country , who believe in justice , we met most of the night and this morning , and we brought Casper in with us , to find out what could be ( lone before Dilman becomes President . " " He is already President , " said Eaton calmly . " I saw him sworn in last night . " " Illegal procedure 's what you saw , " said Miller . " Casper and the rest of us have covered that point . There are plenty of loopholes in  | t h e Succession Act . We 're fixing to have the whole thing nullified . W'e 're getting up this preliminary challenge for the House Judiciary Committee . I 'm here because I 'm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we 're doing , Mr. Secretary . After all , if we win , you 're the one person directly affected . If we can disqualify Dilman , then you 're the one to replace him , by special election , if necessary . We 're only trying to make you President , Mr. Secretary . " " I should be grateful , " said Eaton coldly , " but I am only interested in upholding the law . " Miller had spun away . " Casper , read them our findings . " Casper Wine was already tugging a massive legal brief out of his brown case . Eaton shook his head . " We do n't have time to hear a reading of any brief . President Dilman is on his way here , and there is a good deal of business to transact . . . . Mr. Wine , forget any reading . Tell us in your own words what you have in that appeal . " Casper Wine squinted despairingly through his convex spectacle lenses at Miller . Miller shrugged , then said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Casper . " The myopic constitutional attorney brought the legal brief up high , close to his eyes , until it all but obscured his face . Slowly he peeled the pages , reading to himself , and at last he lowered the brief to his lap . He began to speak in a hesitant falsetto , his magnified eyes not on Eaton or Talley but roaming his brief , the carpet , the shoes of his sponsor . " It is difficult  --  uh  --  difficult to reduce our appeal to a few generalities without  --  uh  --  without reciting our researches into precedent , previous Acts  --  uh  --  Acts of Succession and constitutional history , " he said . " I shall attempt to condense our case . " His eyes closed behind his fat lenses , and then his eyes and his mouth opened . " If you will read the Constitution , you will see under Article II , Section 1 , Paragraph 6 , that should both the Presidentuh  --  President and Vice-President die , then Congress shall have the right to declare  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' until a President shall be elected . ' Now then , Congress three times passed bills clarifying  --  uh  --  clarifying the succession , and the last bill in 1947 provided that the Speaker should be next in line , the President pro tempore of the  --  uh  --  the Senate after him , and the Secretary of State after him . Under this bill of 1947 , within the framework of the Constitution , it is highly questionable if  --  uh  | Dilman , this Douglass Dilman , can be sworn in , that is , can become in actuality President of the United States . First , the wording of the Constitution makes it clear  --  uh  --  clear that the successor must be an Officer , ' and the weight of legal opinion is that Dilman as a Senator , and the Speaker before him , and the  --  uh  --  the Secretary of State after him are not technically officers at all . If Dilman is not an Officer , ' how can he be eligible to become President ? " Talley turned to Eaton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrinkled his nose and shook his head . " Too weak . I think it is doubtful if you can overturn an Act of Succession on a minor semantic issue . " " We shall sec , " said Casper Wine . " But let us suppose  --  uh  --  suppose you are found to be right , Mr. Secretary . Next , we come to a stronger challenge . ' l'lhe Constitution states plainly that the successor shall  --  uh  --  shall  --  and I emphasize this  --  shall act as President ' until a President shall he elected . ' In short , Senator Dilman may act as President , in an honorary custodial sense as he acted as chairman in the Senate , until a special election is held across the country to give us a new and legal President for four more years . " Once more , Eaton was shaking his head . " I do n't see that . In the recent past , eight Vice-Presidents succeeded eight dead Presidents , and they did not act as Presidents , they performed as Presidents . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wine . " The first mista was made when William Harrison passed away in 1841 . The Cabinet informed and addressed his successor , John Tyler , as Vice-President of the United States , Acting President , which was correct . Tyler , wishing the power , honors , and title of full President , ignored  --  uh  --  ignored the Cabinet , and made himself full President and spoke  --  uh  --  spoke of his accession to the Presidency , ' despite protests of many senators . Other successors merely followed his high-handed illegal custom . Almost all  --  uh  --  all of these successors have been challenged in the press . Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson were so challenged . But nothing more happened . " Zeke Miller jumped into view , and stood over Eaton . " This time , Mr. Secretary , we 're seeing to it something happens . We 're abiding by our beloved Constitution . If Dilman is not an officer , he is not eligible for the Presidency . If he is an officer , then he is eligible to act as President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country to vote for a legal President  --  hopefully , Mr. Secretary , yourself . "  | Eaton stood up . " Forget about me . I am not the issue . " " You are the issue , " said Miller excitedly . " Six former Secretaries of State have become Presidents , but no President pro tempore of the Senate ever did . You are our best candidate . " " Congressman Miller , " said Eaton wearily , " you can have no candidate for another year and five months , because you have a President . . . . Mr. Wine , I appreciate your legal briefing . I can have no part of it . I will not deter you or the Congressman from presenting your findings before the House Judiciary . I can only remark that I must serve President Dilman until I am told not to do so . " Congressman Zeke Miller began to grin . " Fair enough , fair enough . You let us carry the ball , and you stand by . Believe me , Mr. Secretary , you wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and signaled Casper Wine to his feet . He paused before Talley . " I 'm looking out for all of us , Governor . I am all-fired determined , by legallneans which exist , to prevent that there Dilman from selling out our heritage to that parcel of black terrorists in the Turnerite gang and to those whining hymn singers in the Crispus Society and NAACP . You can tell Dilman he can play President for a couple days , but you better also tell him not to go to the expense of moving into the White House . " He winked . " I like that old House , I like the color it is right now . " After Miller and Wine had gone , the clatter of their footsteps on the tile corridor quickly receding , the Fish Room was silent . Eaton and Talley did not look at one another . Eaton occupied himself inserting a cigarette into his silver holder and lighting it . When he had taken several puffs , he met Talley 's gaze . " I do not like that man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " He 's a nasty customer , no question . You 'd think he 'd know better . But I understand his kind . I 've been through his state with T.C. , and there are loads of Millers down there . When you 've seen that , you can know how he feels about having Dilman in here . " " Wayne , you must believe me , I have nothing against Dilman because he is black . I simply have no prejudices about color . " " Neither have I , " said Talley hastily . Speaking more to himself than to Talley , Eaton went on . " I could never be on Miller 's side or Hankins ' side or anyone 's for such a reason . In fact , I would feel an obligation to defend President Dilman against such attacks . " He considered what he would say next . " I could find myself resisting Dilman , and being unwillingly thrown  | in with the Miller crowd , for only two reasons . If Dilman were , indeed , to perform as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation , if he were to show favoritism to men of his race to the detriment of the country as a whole , I would have to oppose him . And if he were to fall under the wrong influence , jettison T.C. 's program and T.C. 's team , I would have to fight him . " Then he added , " I do not anticipate either of these problems arising . " " Well , up on the senior side of the Hill there 's a little more concern , Arthur , " said Talley . " Senator Hankins feels that the only way to preserve T.C. 's program is to preserve his Cabinet . They 've been trying to figure out a way of curbing Dilman 's power of removal . " " Yes , I guess I heard something of that last night . " " They 're worried about 1 ) ilinan moving in , feeling his oats after a bit , and then firing you and replacing you with a Negro friend or some white liberal who will toady to him . They 're worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rightful line of succession . " Eaton pursed his lips . " I believe that they are building straw men to knock down . " " They want to play it safe , Arthur . As long as you 're around , they feel there is someone to oversee Dilman , make sure he speaks T.C. 's language and signs bills with T.C. 's pen . Then , too , they 're all feeling a little fatalistic  --  with good reason  --  and they want to make sure that if anything happens to Dilman , you 'll be around to succeed him , you and not someone , Negro or white , who does not represent the Party 's platform . " " Yes , I see , " said Eaton thoughtfully . " Whatever they do , they had better make sure it is within the limitations imposed by the Constitution . " " I 'm curious to know exactly what they 're up to , " Talley said . " We know what Miller and his House boys are doing , but I keep wondering about Senator Hankins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He started for the telephone , but hesitated when he reached it . " No , I do n't think I want to talk to Hankins . That 'll be Miller all over again . " He snapped his fingers . " I know ? " He lifted the receiver and dialed one digit . " Edna ? This is Governor Talley . Be a good girl and hook me up with Senator Hoyt Watson . He 's probably still at home . . . . Yes , I 'll wait . " Across the room Arthur Eaton waited , too . When he heard Talley get his connection and begin to question Senator Watson , he ejected his cigarette butt from the holder and replaced it with a  | fresh cigarette . It was the first time in a decade , to his surprise , that he had found it necessary to chain-smoke . CONCENTRATING on the postcard-sized screen of the miniature Swiss television set , which stood on the white Formica breakfast table between them , Sally Watson heard her father say , " One second , Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from her coffee to find her father jabbing a finger at the television set . " Sally , " he called to her over the din , " would you mind lowering it a trifle ? " " Of course not , Dad . " She put down her coffee , reached out and turned down the volume . " That 's better , baby . " Senator Hoyt Watson 's long Percheron face had gone back to the mouthpiece from which he removed his hand . " Okay , Governor , would you repeat your question ? " As she picked up her coffee cup again , Sally Watson 's attention returned to the television screen . The horrible newsreel film of the Frankfurt catastrophe had ended , and now the network was beginning to project a hastily prepared documentary biography to acquaint its viewers with President Douglass Dilman . Fascinated , she watched the unreal scene in the Cabinet Room of the White House the night before , as Senator Dilman took the Presidential oath . Although she had seen Dilman a number of times in the corridors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs , she had never really been aware of him as an individual , she realized . In close-up on the television screen , he became a person , a very dark person , to be sure , but a man with neat wavy hair , kind eyes , and a habit of rubbing his upper lip with his lower one . Now the film took viewers back to Dilman 's beginnings . There were scenes of a Midwestern city slum area , where Dilman had been born over fifty years ago , and still photographs of an unattraclive infant in absurd lacy dresses , and then dull shots of school buildings , and Sally Watson 's interest began to wane and her head began to throb . She poured herself a third cup of black coffee , hoping her father would not see this , and she wondered at what point during the gruesome party last night she had switched from vodka to Scotch . She could not remember , except that she had made the change be-  | cause the vodka had done nothing for her and she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all that incessant and tiresome Grim Reaper chatter provoked by T.C. 's death . More and more , she knew , she was mixing her drinks at parties , determined to attain euphoria swiftly , and more and more often the hangovers were persisting late into the next day , when she was forced to rid herself of them with fresh drinks and new pills . Drinking the third cup of black coffee , she tried to devote herself to the television screen . But now her father was replying to Talley , and since the sound volume on the set was low , it was superseded by her father 's basso , so that his voice and the image on the screen blended and created litter confusion . Because her father 's voice was more alive than the pictures on the screen , and dominated them , she surrendered viewing for listening . IIcr father , a large , impressive , authoritative figure , with his trademark shock of white hair and his trademark black string tic in evidence , was drawling into the telephone . " Certainly I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he was saying , " and neither will my constituents be happy . I do n't like to have truck with Hankins and Miller and their Ku Klux Klan adherents , but at the same time I must agree with them that the country is today faced with a crisis . I do n't like having a Negro as Chief Executive any more than they do , but I do n't like it for different reasons . I do n't think the country is ready for a colored man as President , and I foresee endless strife . I do n't think Dilman , the little I know of him , is up to the rigors of the office . He is adequately educated , modest , a good Party man , but I do n't think he is cut out of Presidential cloth . He may blunder us into considerable grief , unless we hold a firm rein on him . However , this I can assure you , Governor , and you may repeat my words to the Secretary of State ? I can not in good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent him from holding an office allowed him by the Constitution . I will not subscribe to that . On the other hand , I believe that what Senator Hankins is proposing to do does make a certain amount of sense ? " He halted to listen to Talley , nodding his head slightly at whatever he was hearing . Since her father was not speaking , and the audio part of the television set was merely an indistinct hum , Sally concentrated on her coffee , as if this concentration would help eliminate her hangover .  | If she had not drunk so much at the Leroy Poole affair last night , she might have been in better shape now and this might have been an absorbing morning . In twenty-six years she could not remember a morning that gave so much promise of excitement , of an exchange of tidings and rumor . Sally Watson was a girl who thrived upon turmoil . It stimulated her and gave her empty days meaning . When there bloomed confusion , scandal , the possibility of adventure , she was enriched . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for three short and almost fruitless efforts at self-understanding and adjustment with three concerned psychoanalysts in the last eight years . She knew also that when life did not provide this stimulation , her days became devoid of meaning , and she sought to fill them with drugs and drink . She despised this need in herself , this weakness , and envied other women who controlled their restlessness with husbands , children , or careers . She was tangibly marked by her failure . She could see the mark now , as she drank her coffee , the white line across her right wrist , a permanent reminder of the dreadful time when she had slashed her wrist in an effort to solve everything . That had been seven or eight years ago , after she had been dropped from Radcliffe for the marijuana party ( Senator Watson had " arranged " to have her quietly withdrawn from the school ) , and after she had tried to work for the advertising agency in New York City ( Senator Watson had " arranged " the job ) , and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Senator Watson had " arranged " to keep the marriage out of the papers , and have it annulled , and have the boy deported ) . That feeble effort at selfdestruction had been one institution and three analysts ago , very long ago , but the scar reminded her of what was possible , and for this she blamed her father , although she loved him , really , and her mother , in Rome with that parasite second husband who was a count , whom she hated and admired , and her stepmother , whom she disliked only for being an intruder and a bore . Yes , she told herself , this morning  --  with T.C. dead and a Negro in the Presidency  --  might have been a ball . As one who had nothing but affection for the idea of death , who equated it with peace , she felt no loss at T.C. 's extinction . In truth , she had not cared for T.C. because he had refused , despite her father 's weighty intervention , to give her a job in the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual Congressional Dinner the President had given , he  | page deleted  | Abruptly he halted , his white-maned head cocked sideways , and Ilion he resumed . " No , I do n't know if it is constitutional . But it can serve us until It is tested . I have n't the vaguest idea if Dilman would sign it or veto it  --  I do n't know that man at all , Governor , no one does  --  but if he has good faith , I think he will see the reasonableness and come along . I think this bill can be moved through to his desk quietly , without too much ballyhoo and fuss . I 'm the last one to want it to appear that we are trying to manacle Dilman because of his race . As a matter of fact , Governor , I am approaching this New Succession Bill of Hankins ' not as something that may serve us only now , in this emergency , but as something that can serve us in the future , so that other successors can not recklessly unseat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own race or creed or party , or with incompetents who happen to be sycophants or relatives . In fact , I 'm trotting over to the Hill now to see if I can assist llankins with the language . I do n't want it to be a vindictive measure , but one that can be useful in the present and future . What 's that , Governor ? Arthur Eaton wants to say  --  all right , put him on . " With the second mention by her father of Secretary of State Arthur Eaton 's name , Sally Watson had become entirely alert and attentive . Now that her father was listening to Eaton , she bent forward , hoping to hear Eaton 's seductive voice on the phone , but it was impossible to hear a thing at this distance across the table . At last she shut off the television set , rose , and noiselessly began to gather the breakfast dishes from the table . Normally , on maid 's day off , she and her stepmother did the dishes . But her stepmother had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sally lacked the patience to do this menial work by herself . She emptied the leftovers into the garbage disposal , and waited for her father to finish . Senator Watson was speaking into the telephone . " I concur , Arthur . I subscribe to everything you say . It will be judicious . I shall lend my weight to that . I will keep you closely informed . . . . Let me add , I do n't seem to have had time up to now to tell you how sorry I am about the tragedy . I was n't as close to T.C. as you , but I respected him . It is a horrendous blow to the country . Nevertheless , the realities of life . We live with them . Let 's do our best . .. . Good luck today , Arthur , good luck to both of us . " From where she stood quietly at the sink behind him , Sally  | watched her father put away the telephone , pull free his napkin , wipe his mouth , and stand up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she waited , eager to speak to one who had just spoken to Arthur Eaton . " Dad ? " " Oh , hello , baby . I thought you were dressing . I 've got to rush off . I 'm late already . " " Dad , I was listening to everything . It 's all very dangerous , is n't it ? " ITe studied her for a moment . " Well , dangerous is n't precisely the word . Nothing as ominous as that . Any new President creates certain problems for everyone , but -a new one of Dilman 's race , in times like this , well , the problems are definitely heightened . " Sally ran her fingers through her thick blond hair . " It gives me the chills to think how close Arthur Eaton came to being the President . Would n't that have been wonderful ? " Hoyt Watson disappeared into the next room a moment , and reappeared with his hat and birch cane . " Well , " he said , " with Eaton we 'd have had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Eaton . " Sally was not satisfied . " Do you think Arthur Eaton could still become President ? " Thoughtfully Hoyt Watson tapped his cane on the kitchen linoleum . " Unlikely , Sally . If you understand what I was discussing with Talley , you know what is going on . " " I have an idea . " " Representative Miller likes to imagine that he is John C. Calhoun . It was Calhoun , you remember , who used to remark that it was false to believe that all men are born free and equal . The assumption , he used to say , was based upon facts contrary to universal observation . Well , now , time has passed Calhoun by , and the time and the law say all men are free and equal , no matter what the realities . In short , no matter how nostalgic I may be for the past , I 've founded my entire career on progress and observing the law . Representative Zeke Miller thinks otherwise , and where once he might have had an overflow auditorium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the auditorium only one-third filled . Ile wants to prevent Dilman from becoming President . He is acting out a dream of the past . He wo n't succeed in ousting Dilman simply because Dilman is black , and in getting Eaton elected because he is white . Dilman is our President , improbable as that is to conceive . "  | " What about the new law you were discussing ? " " Well , even if we get it , that wo n't change things very much , not In actuality . It will only prevent Dilman from discharging Eaton , Moody , Kemmler , the rest of T.C. 's Cabinet . Our idea is that we want this Cabinet so that Dilman is encouraged to follow T.C. 's Ideas and the Party 's wishes . Then , as a show of goodwill on our Dart , we 've agreed not to elect either a new Speaker of the House or a President pro tempore of the Senate , so that no one precedes the succession line of T.C. 's Cabinet for the rest of the unexpired term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job of presiding on an alphabetical , weekly basis . That would be in the bill , too . " " If the law passes , it would make Arthur Eaton the President  --  I mean , should something happen to Dilman , would n't it ? " " Yes , of course , " said Hoyt Watson . " But nothing 's going to happen to Dilman . We 've had all the accidents we 're going to have , and Dilman is a young man , Arthur Eaton 's age , and strong as a bull , I 'm sure . " Watson paused , and eyed his daughter keenly . " Why this sudden interest in politics , Sally ? This is more than I 've heard from you in a year . I 'm gratified . " Sally moved toward her father , eased his hat from his hand , and placed it on his head . " I 'm not interested in politics especially , Dad . I 'm interested in Arthur Eaton . I have enormous admiration for him . I 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , of course . " Hoyt Watson chuckled . " You can forget about your father . He has everything he wants out of life . As to Eaton ? " He looked down at her , and then he said , " Your interest in our Secretary of State would n't be personal , would it ? I 'm just remembering . I thought I saw you spending an inordinate amount of time with him at Allan Noyes 's party . " " I think he 's the most attractive man in Washington . " " His wife thinks so , too , " Hoyt Watson said with a wink . He pecked Sally 's cheek , turned to go , then halted . " Tell your mother I may be late for dinner . I 'll try to call her later . " He was gone , leaving Sally with a flare of resentment at his having referred to her stepmother as her mother . But the irritation was quickly dispelled as she tried to recollect everything her father had said about Arthur Eaton and his position in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sink , she went to her vast cream-colored bedroom . She pulled the drapes open , to find the day halfheartedly sunny . She went to her double bed , a mess  | from the gyrations of her restless , drunken sleep , and quickly drew the blanket and quilt over it . She moved to her tall mirrored dressing table , pulled her long green housecoat around her , and sat on the bench to make up . Her gaze fell on the framed color portrait of her taken two years ago , just after T.C. 's inauguration , when she had played the Southern belle in that silly satire at the Press Club . She examined the portrait with detachment . When Arthur Eaton looked at her , was this what he saw ? I Ier blond hair was combed high and curling to one side , her frank , emerald eyes were what countless crude young men had called " bedroom eyes , " her nose was small and agreeably tilted , the beauty mark at the left of the mouth accentuated her full crimson lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mirror , the portrait was two years old . It did not reveal the shadows under her eyes , born of twenty-four months of drinks and barbiturates . Nevertheless , she remained hypnotized by her color portrait . Her complexion was marvelous , milky white and flawless , then as now . Yet , it was not a usual pretty-Southern-girl face . There was something hidden behind it that was wild and pitiful , although its outer aspect was childish and moody . But interesting , she decided , interesting , and not too much of its attraction had been traded for the liquor and pills that she used to fight the insomnia and emotional self-hate of unlovely fornication . Then , too , there was more for Eaton that no portrait could reveal . Impulsively , not bothering about the morning 's makeup , she came to her feet , unfastened the housecoat , and threw it across the bench . She made her way to the center of the bedroom , and slowly paraded , as poised as one can he in lace brassiere and clinging panties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not marred any feature of her slender , lithe figure . Her breasts were high and large , her belly flat , her hips boyish , her thighs and legs long and nearly perfect . Satisfied , she returned to the bench and , casting the housecoat aside , sat down to devote herself to her makeup and Arthur Eaton , lucky man . Merging memory with hope , she relived her short , happy life with Arthur Eaton , and almost miraculously her hangover evaporated . She had always been conscious of him , at least in the two and more years he had been Secretary of State , conscious of his incredibly handsome face with its contained sensuality , and of his  | breeding and manners . But then , she had not thought about him too much , certainly no more than she had ever thought about a motion picture hero , because he had often had his wife , that immaculate , haughty icicle , Kay Varney Eaton , on his arm , and there was no real connection to be made with him . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcomed it , stored it , and among the tidbits of gossip that had come to her was one , from a reliable source , that Eaton and his wife had separated . This rumor had been given some credibility six weeks ago , four large parties ago , when she had found herself sitting next to him at the dinner party given by Secretary of Defense Carl Steinbrenncr . Eaton had been alone . No Kay Varney Eaton anywhere . She had discovered him similarly unattached at Tim Flannery 's crowded and raucous outdoor barbecue . And when the national Party chairman , Allan Noyes , had given his large cocktail and dinner affair during the hot spell , and many of the guests , including herself , had gone swimming in the pool late at night , she had been more certain than ever that Eaton had rid himself of that monstrous wife . Finishing her eye makeup , she reexamined her relationship with Arthur Eaton . The first of their three public meetings , the Steinbrenner one , had been largely exploratory . She had perceived that Eaton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as a glamorous and pretty girl . He had wanted to know about her , rather formally but persistently , and she had told him all that she believed he should know . At the Flannery party he had come in sports coat and slacks ? gorgeous man  --  and she had been wearing the open-necked jonquil silk blouse and yellow shantung skirt , and been bare-legged and gay , and he had sought her out , remembering things she had told him about herself , and then for the first time telling her something of his own life and feelings . The Noyes party had been the best . After most of the guests had departed , he had been one of the few top-level ones to remain . He had sat in a deck chair near the pool , drinking brandy steadily , and his eyes had followed her from the cabana to the pool . She had known that in her tight white two-piece swimming suit she was a feast for any male 's eyes . Later , drying , she had sat at his feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very late and they were almost the last , she had realized that her father had gone and that she must call a taxi . Eaton had insisted upon driving her to Arlington .  | She still remembered the drive . They had both been drunk , or rather she had been drunk and he had been high , and she had sat curled close to him and held one of his hands when it was free from the wheel , and he had covered hers firmly with his own . In the darkened street before her house he had kept the motor idling , and then , never taking his eyes from her face , he had turned off the ignition . " You are quite a young lady , " he had said . " I do n't think I have ever met anyone quite like you before . " " I hope not . There 's no one anywhere like me . " " I suppose you have a hundred young men to keep you occupied . " " I could have . I do n't . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , troubled , and so she had helped him . " I have no patience , any more , for immature children . I 've had all the young intellectual buzzards , dedicated patriots , **25;0;TOOLONG I can stand . Too tiresome . If I ca n't have what I want , I 'll pass . " He had taken an eternity to say the next . " What do you want , Sally ? " Despite her intoxicated state , she had maintained her control . " Oh , I do n't know . Someone like Mrs. Eaton 's husband . " " You 're teasing an old man , Sally . Not fair . " " You 're not old at all , and I 'm not teasing one bit . " " I see . . . I must make a confession , too , Sally . I 've found you more refreshing than anyone I 've met in ages . I do n't have much free time , except occasional evenings . Perhaps you would let me call you for dinner sometime . " Her heart had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the front seat , gone across the wheel , taken his surprised face in one hand , and kissed him on the lips . " There , " she had said . " Now I 'm a fallen woman , and you ca n't abandon me . I 'll be waiting for that dinner . " The morning after had been her best morning in years . But that entire day , and in the several days following , he had not called , and she had begun to believe that she had invested too much in his promise and her hope . Either he had been drunk and indiscreet , and had now sobered and forgotten the flirtation , or he had weighed it and decided that a married Cabinet officer could have nothing to do , no matter how innocent , with the neurotic half-his-age daughter of a senator . Then , in her misery and consequent drinking , Sally had decided that it was his wife who was to blame . Despite flimsy rumor , Kay Varney was his wife , and was coming home or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact of it , and good-bye rendezvous and good-bye dinner . And then , the other evening or morning , she had forgotten which , she had read Reb Blaser 's column . Arthur and Kay Eaton were  --  it was in black print , rumor or not , it was in print  --  separated , with divorce imminent . The effect upon her was like that of a half-dozen vodkas . She soared . She walked on air . She was ten miles high , and almost in orbit . Her prospects rose with her . The fact that Arthur Eaton had not yet telephoned her , as he had said he would , meant only that he was busy with man 's work and not that he was confined by husbandhood . In her exhilaration Sally had wanted to telephone him , chide him for not keeping his word , but her instinct restrained her from this aggressive act . Also , she had told herself , it would have been in poor taste , after that wonderful Reb Blaser story . Eaton would call . Of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , they would meet soon , and this time she would make sure that he knew of her desire for him . Yesterday she had even begun to think about contriving accidental meetings , when the Frankfurt tragedy had broken over her . As the daughter of a senator , she knew what that meant . Arthur would be busy for a while , busier than ever . She had completed her makeup and was content with the result . She went to her wardrobe to search out the proper dress for this first day of a new administration , a day that had brought her Arthur ( since Reb Blaser 's column , she had determinedly begun to regard him as her Arthur ) to within a step of the Presidency . Holding f out and rejecting dresses , she wondered how she could prove her love to Arthur Eaton . She could , of course , give herself wholly to him  --  not difficult  --  and let him be young once more and enjoy what he had certainly been deprived of by Kay Eaton . Still , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship . Mature men required much more . They wanted a woman interested in them , interested in their lives , their careers , a woman as concerned about them as they were concerned with themselves . At night a woman could resurrect a man 's ego in bed . But day had more hours . Successful women , the great courtesans of France , for instance , the mistresses of the rulers , women like Madame de Pompadour , survived and remained on top because they were not only love partners but helpmates . How could she be a helpmate to a public figure already so successful , the foremost member of the  | President 's Cabinet ? How could she be of any use to a public figure who already possessed everything ? , Just as she settled upon the simple blue Galletti suit and removed it from the hanger , something crossed her mind . She recalled her father 's conversation with Talley , and her own conversation with her father . Evidently Arthur Eaton did not have everything , yet . Overnight his position in the Cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was the next in line to the Presidency . Senator Hankins and her father were working to keep him in the Cabinet , and believed that they would succeed . Representative Miller was working to make him President-at once , but her father did not think this was possible . Clearly Arthur Eaton could use help . She wondered what help she could offer . If she were to come to know this Dilman , know him well , she might succeed , as a woman , where august councils failed . She might convince Dilman that Arthur Eaton was indispensable to him and to the country , that he must not only be retained as Secretary of State but must be given a heavy share of the Presidential powers . But she did not know Dilman , and it was hopeless , and then it occurred to her that she felt she knew Dilman , and then she remembered why . It was because of last night 's party , the one that had given her the hangover , the one young Harriet Post , a Senate secretary who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a boozing , literary party of the avant-garde Washington crowd , lower-level , black-and-white . A Negro poet , reedy and homosexual and maybe talented , had given it in his unkempt , sparsely furnished , barnlike upstairs flat , above the hall with the sign over it , JESUS NEVER FAILS , on Georgia Avenue . There had been at least forty persons coming and going , most of them Negro , all drinkers , all too full of T.C. 's death , all discussing the implications of Speaker MacPherson 's accession to the Presidency , and Sally had not enjoyed it particularly . Lately she had grasped at every invitation to a black-and-white party , because it was different , because it might mean a charge of excitement . Unlike her family , she had no feelings against Negroes . In fact , because of her sheltered upbringing in the South , she had always considered them attractive since they were forbidden and hence exotic , and because there were stories she had heard about the men . The stories were not true , she knew , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met the jazz crowd from Harlem , she had slept with two of the colored boys in a band before running off with her Puerto Rican . Both brief affairs had been tiresome disappoint-  | ments , no better , no worse than those with most of the white boys with whom she had s 4t . Perhaps she had expected too much . Perhaps the Negro music Ins had not been able to give enough because they were inhibited by her Southern-supremacy origins . The affair or wake last night had been a drunken bore . She had heard from Harriet about the guest of honor , Leroy Poole , and in fact thought that she had read some of his powerful essays on his years as a Negro in Harlem and on civil rights , and she had expected too much , again . Leroy Poole had looked like anything but an author . He had proved to be short , fat , perspiring , resembling nothing more than a jet-black eight ball . He had been supercilious and self-centered , too knowing and opinionated about everything and everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several choice anecdotes ridiculing MacPherson , who everyone had thought was the new Chief Executive . Sally remembered that Poole had read aloud several passages from his second novel ( still in the works , stream-of-consciousness ) , bitter narrative sections that made no sense and gave no fun when you were half drunk . After the applause he had explained the novel , and for a while his idea had held Sally 's attention . It was hard to recall it clearly the morning after , but there was something about the near future in the United States , something about a sudden outbreak of bubonic plague in the heavily Negro-populated county of a state similar to South Carolina or Louisiana ( where some counties are 80 per cent Negro ) , but where the minority whites keep control because of their ties to the outside world . Overnight , to prevent the raging epidemic from spreading , this county is quarantined from the rest of the state and nation . No one can enter or leave . After a few months this isolated county has a population 90 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must live this way for several years . " There it is , see ? " Leroy Poole had squeaked , waving the manuscript in his pudgy fist . " Shoe on the other foot , see ? Now we are the Ins and they are the Outs . How come ? ' Cause gradual-like , the Negroes begin dominating the voting , buying and spending , law enforcement , the works . And pretty soon Negroes are running government , schools , business . And the poor whites left , the minority , what happens to them ? Well , now , do n't you know ? Negroes hire white women for their maids and white gents for their handymen . Now the whites go to the back of the bus , to the segregated lousy puking little white schools , and the Negroes got the run of the county . What do you say , friends , how 's that for an acidy parable ? "  | She could recollect little more of it , or perhaps Leroy Poole had refused to tell any more . She had thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would finish it , and if he did , how it would be received . Now , dressing , she realized that , by coincidence , Leroy Poole 's way-out fantasy of last night had  --  well , a small portion of it had ? become a reality with Douglass Dilman 's accession to the Presidency . Her mind , remernhering Dilman , remembered last night when she had found herself on a torn sofa beside Leroy Poole , listening to him discuss Dilman . It all came back to her , the connection , Poole and Dilman , not what Poole had been saying . A Negro publisher had given Poole a sizable advance against royalties to write a biography of Senator Douglass Dilman , since Dilman was one of the highest-ranking Negroes in government . Poole had not been enthusiastic , for some reason , but had needed the cash to finish his novel , and had undertaken the chore . IIe had come to Washington weeks ago , received Dilman 's cooperation , and had been practically living with the Senator , gathering information on the Senator 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun writing the madeto-order book . She recalled a thread of Poole 's conversation , to someone , to Harriet or herself . " I 've gotten to know Senator Dilman better than he knows himself , I 've been that close  --  but do n't hold it against me , sister ! " He had screamed with laughter , a disconcerting high-pitched laughter , and after that she had left Poole for the bottle of Scotch . Suddenly the creative process began to work inside Sally . She could almost feel it working , and she ceased buttoning her blouse to let it happen . Poole had said that Dilman was a widower , with a son , no one else . That was last night when Dilman was a senator . This morning he was the President of the United States , still a widower , with a son , and no one else . Who would run his life for him , the social part , the feminine part ? A new President always made new appointments , hired new personnel . Whom would Dilman hire for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He might hold over some of T.C. 's staff , and the First Lady 's staff , but there would still be openings that would have to be filled , and there would certainly be resignations . Sally 's mind went to at least a halfdozen of her Southern girl friends who would not , or whose husbands or families would not let them , work under a Negro , President or no.  | That was it , that was surely it , Sally exulted to herself . There would be an opening in the White House for a white girl of high social breeding and with a political background , to assist the new ! ' resident , a girl who had many Negro friends and so could , in a natural way , give the President guidance in the world of white socialites about him . There would be an opening which she could fill , and in filling it give aid to that wonderful , kindly-looking Negro who had become Chief Executive , and in aiding him , gaining his dependence upon her , she could represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur 's helpmate on the highest level . Only one piece of the puzzle was missing , and once that was in place the picture was there , made sense , and her future was assured . The missing piece was the image of the go-between who could get her offer of service to the new President himself . And she had that , too . Last night , last night , Leroy Poole , living with Oilman , writing about Dilman , last night a senator 's biographer , this morning a President 's historian . Her mind fitted the last piece into the puzzle , and the picture that she saw and embraced was that of herself and Arthur , captioned by the lettering of her imagination : Secretary of State Arthur Eaton and Mrs. Sally Watson Eaton . She ran to the cream-colored French telephone beside her bed , and then , as her hand clutched it , she tried desperately to remember the hotel where Leroy Poole was staying . Not the Shoreham , not the Mayflower , not the Hilton or Willard , no . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be doing in one of those expensive big places ? She eliminated the big hotels . She tried to think . It was some cheap hovel , ridiculously named , in the heart of town . She had heard it mentioned several times last night . It was on  --  yes , on F Street  --  heavens , but where  --  heavens  --  yes ! That was it  --  Paradise  --  the Paradise Hotel on F Street . She picked up the telephone and dialed for information .. . The instant after the alarm clock went off , Leroy Poole opened his eyes , reached out and shut off the bell , flung aside his blanket , then settled back on the pillow and , lying perfectly still , began his daily morning exercise . For five minutes , he performed this Spartan drill , a system of valuable and mystic calisthenics of his own invention , one known  | only to himself . As he engaged in it , he knew that his daily ritual would have astounded an outsider , especially a white outsider . Where most men did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to give tone to their physiques , Leroy Poole practiced an exercise consisting solely of remaining immobile on his bed , first contemplating his gross body , then conjuring up his gross past . Once , wondering if this physical inactivity could be rightly regarded as exercise at all , Leroy Poole had looked up the word in Webster 's Dictionary . Exercise was , among other things , " Exertion for the sake of training or improvement , whether physical , intellectual or moral . " Pleased with the definition , he had continued to practice his peculiar form of exercise under its familiar name . Leroy Poole 's morning exercise followed an unvarying routine . After awakening , and removing his blanket , he set his eyes on the mound of flesh before him , gazing at the flabby chest and jelly protrusion of stomach encased in capacious cotton pajamas . Sometimes he studied his hands , the fatness of the sausage fingers . He was not concerned with this obesity of the flesh , the distorted plasticity of it , for he had been told that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was concerned that the outer softness so unfairly contradicted the inner hardness , making it more difficult for others , and himself as well , to take his aggressive word sermons and crusading pen seriously . Since no physical exertion could reduce his body to the same hardness as that of his mind and heart , Leroy Poole compensated for this by toiling daily to invigorate and fortify what lay invisible beneath his skull and skin . Like Richard Wright , a boyhood idol , Leroy Poole had learned long ago that " there existed men against whom I was powerless , men who could violate my life at will , " and that their savage and unjust superiority must be combated , even unto death . He had to toughen his will against white men 's bribes : no money , no comfort , no intellectual rationalizing , no compromise promises of future Green Pastures , no white token acceptance and approval could be permitted to negate the searing helplessness and humiliation that he and his family had suffered , were suffering , or allowed to modify and weaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the muscles  --  the inner muscles of righteous hate ? that Leroy Poole sought to energize and sustain every morning . The exercise performed was a simple one : he remembered his past , and was strong again . It was not always easy . It had not been easy this morning . Last  | night 's party had left him weakened , and a residue of this weakness r ( nruned . It had not been the drinks . He did not drink . His abstinence he owed less to the hellfire Baptist upbringing of his childhood than to the fact that drinks ntde black men as foolish as white nu+n , but while white men could afford such lapses , black men could not . The weakness that carried over from the party was caused by the fact that he had been induced to read aloud a passage from his new novel , and relate some of the story , and he had been applauded and been made prideful and been lulled into believing , briefly , that life might not be so bad after all . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he despised the work he must do in the next hours , days , weeks . He resented having to abandon his polemics , his angry and effective articles and essays on his experiences as a Negro and on his ideas about equality , for which he was poorly paid , to undertake a hack political biography that would profit him nothing but money . He resented , too , delaying his great novel , a moral earthquake that would shake the mossbacks and crackers of the South and the pretentious tolerators of the North from their fixed poles of prejudice . He resented delaying it in order to feed the vanity of stupid and ignorant Negro readers who wanted to enjoy vicariously the rise to Congress of one of their own color . And there was more that distressed him after the alarm clock had jarred him from his sleep . He was ashamed of himself for the small corruption of making heroic , to his people , an undeserving ward heeler who , through servility and errand-running and asslicking , had become a senator . If only he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and true Negro leader like Jeff Hurley , his beloved friend , his superior in the Turnerites , it would be a worthwhile and noble endeavor . But then , he knew , the Hurleys did not become congressmen in the paleface world . Only the handful of Dilmans could make it , because they were puking counterfeit whites . It distressed Leroy Poole that he must spend this precious day typing up notes of his last meeting with Dilman , preparing questions for the next interview , and then spend several months more writing the crummy , phony biography . If he could not do his own work , he told himself upon awakening , then at the very least he should be at the barricades , where the action was , where the freedom fight would finally be won , just the way the whites had won their fight at Concord and Bunker Hill . He was miserable about the Turnerite fiasco in Hattiesburg , Mis-  | sissippi , yesterday . He had known for some time , having learned about it from Hurley , that the first step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had not known the result until last night . His mind went back to last night . Because he had been offered a ride , and had research to do , he left the party early , over much protestation . The streets were curiously desolate , but then he supposed this was because T.C. had been killed and everyone was at home or in bars glued to television sets . There had been some talk between his driver , a Howard University boy , and himself about the President 's demise and what it might mean to their cause , and they agreed it meant nothing at all . Since the time Theodore Roosevelt had invited Booker T. Washington to the White House , no white President had proved any better than another for them . It was not yet ten o'clock when Leroy Poole was deposited before the small , three-story hotel , rising between an alley and a grocery store , its broken red neon sign shining out : PARADISE HOTEL . IIe entered the minuscule lobby , with its spotted rug and seven threadbare chairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Peering off , he saw the pimply young clerk at a table in the office , head in his arms , snoring softly . Leroy Poole went behind the desk , pulled down his key , and then walked toward the rickety self-service elevator . He paused at the newspaper rack , to buy the late edition , but the rack was empty . Disappointed because he had anticipated seeing the space the Mississippi demonstration received , he considered going out in search of a newspaper . At that moment he sighted one newspaper folded on a chair . It proved to be a discarded early evening edition , and the headlines proclaimed T.C. 's death and Speaker MacPherson 's succession to the Presidency . Leroy Poole took the newspaper up to his second-floor room , and once he had bolted his door , he sought the results of the Turnerite demonstration in Hattiesburg . As page after page made no report of it , he began to believe that the newspaper had been printed too early to carry the news . And then , on page eighteen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : To counteract the terror of the revived Ku Klux Klan in Mississippi , a Negro activist group , the Turnerites , had sent twelve members , wearing black hoods and robes , to picket a department store owned by the local Klan 's Grand Dragon ; the white proprietor had rushed out , unmasked one Turnerite picket , and thrown sulphuric acid in his face , permanently  | blinding him ; the Negroes had gone berserk , beating the white Klan leader , smashing his store windows and damaging most of the showeases inside ; the armed police and their dogs had come , and two of the Turnerites were in the county hospital , critically injured , and the other ten were in jail . The news report infuriated Leroy Poole in two ways . First , it related that the Turnerites had retaliated for Klan violence with peaceful if dramatic picketing , and , as always , had been brutally attacked ; and second , this horrible story , deserving of a page-one notice which might inspire national revulsion and action , had been buried on a back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States had died . This defeat , as well as all his other frustrations and disappointments , had again filled his head , the instant the alarm jangled this morning . It would not be easy to undertake his daily exercise , and for seconds he considered skipping the exercise this once , but then he knew that he must not permit himself any inner flabbiness .

As this exercising went on , strength growing through hot memory of oppression , Leroy Poole began to feel invigorated and purposeful . He decided that he would do one more minute of it before rising . His mind returned to the South , to personal offenses , to recollections of being shoved off the street , hustled to the rear of a bus , to degradations that he had witnessed , to recollections of his cousin being turned away from the polling place , his best friend being hooted away from the white high school . His mind did these push-ups , sit-ups , bends ; his mind shadowboxed and ran a mile , until the blood throbbed in his temples , and his breathing came in gasps , and the rage coursed through his blood to quicken his heart and his determination never to relent . It was the ringing of the telephone that stopped his exercise .  | Satisfied with his preparation for the day , he shoved himself off the bed , hitched up his pajamas , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the armchair . Sitting , taking up the phone , he hoped that it would be Jeff Hurley , with a full report of t he Mississippi trouble , and anxious to enlist Leroy Poole 's advice as a member of the Turnerite strategy board . " Yeh , hello ? " " Oh , hello there . I hope I have the right room . Is this Leroy Poole , the writer ? " The voice from the other end surprised him , for it came from a female , unmistakably from a refined Southern female . " That 's right . This is Leroy Poole . " " I hope I 'm not interrupting your work , Mr. Poole . This is Sally Watson . Remember me ? " The name reminded him of no lady of his acquaintance . This did not surprise him . There were not many . However , occasionally clubwomen called , to request him to lecture or sit in on a civil rights panel . " I 'm not sure , ma'am . The name is familiar . " " Last night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met last night at the party for you . I was there with a friend . I 'm Senator Hoyt Watson 's daughter ? " He placed her now . The well-shaped , edgy blonde . " Of course , " he said , " of course . How could anyone forget you ? " He swallowed , restrained himself , not yet prepared to go on in this vein with a white girl , not while the remembrance of his cousin 's grave outside Mobile and his own humiliation behind the college gym were alive within him . " I enjoyed the pleasure of meeting you , Miss Watson . " " And I enjoyed hearing you read from your new novel . I think it 's wonderful . " Wonderful , he thought , a savage novel in which whites were reduced to a ten-per-cent minority in one imagined American county . " I 'm glad you were open-minded enough to like it , " he said . " Do n't let my accent or my father 's voting record fool you , " she said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least fifty Negroes among my good friends . " She paused , and then she said , " You must be very excited about the news this morning . " " What news ? " he asked . " The new President , I mean . " " Oh , that . I read all about it last night . I do n't think there 's anything especially exciting about MacPherson becoming President . He ? "  | " MacPherson ? " She almost screamed the name through the telephone . " You mean you do n't know ? " He was utterly bewildered . " Know what ? I just woke up , and I ? " " MacPherson died , too . One of your own people was sworn in as President last night . Your friend Douglass Dilman . " The news vibrated in his ear . IIe sat thunderstruck , speechless and uncomprehending . " Mr. Poole , are you there ? " " I  --  yes  --  I ? arc you sure ? I ca n't believe it . " " It 's the truth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . Well , I 'm glad I could bring you the news ? " " Miss Watson , you 've knocked me out . I 'd better turn on my radio and find out what 's been going on . I sure appreciate your ? " " Mr. Poole , " she called to him urgently , " I really phoned about something else . I wanted to discuss a personal matter ? " " Look , jingle me back in ten minutes , will you ? I 'll be right here . Thanks , Miss Watson . " He slammed the receiver down , almost certain that he was having his leg pulled , jumped up , and found his tiny red transistor radio . As he switched it on , he became positive that she had been teasing him . How in the devil could a rabbit-hearted twerp like Dilman become President of the United States ? He was only a second-rate senator , and a Negro besides . That dizzy , sick dame , with her sadistic Southern joke , damn her . The volume on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice of a network editorial philosopher engulfed him . He listened , incredulous , and then began spinning the selector to other stations . There were news broadcasts . There were interpretive analysts . There were discussion panels . There were taped reports from the man on the street . There were faded reports from London , Paris , Moscow , Rome , Tokyo . Miss Watson was right . It was true . His boy Dilman was the Chief Executive of America the Beautiful . Lor ' Mighty ! I 'll he John Browned ! He listened for five minutes , until he had the facts and they had sunk in , and then he turned the radio off . He wheezed about the room in his baggy pajamas , trying to sort it out , convert it into a facsimile of reality . Once he interrupted his walking , thinking , to ring the desk downstairs and ask the clerk to send the handyman next door for a carton of coffee and a doughnut , overcoming resistance with the promise of an extravagant half-dollar tip .  | He resumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closet-sized bathroom . By the time he had finished his quick shaving , nicking himself twice , his washing , and had changed into sweat shirt , corduroys , and moccasins , his mind had moved from the enormity of the news and narrowed down to himself . What did this upheaval mean to Leroy Poole ? His weeks of intimate conversation with Dilman made it clearly evident that the Senator , now President , was a loner . Whenever Poole had begged for relatives or friends whom he might consult for more objective information , Dilman had turned him aside . " I have almost no one close to me , " he had said . Eventually Poole had extracted several names : Dilman 's son , Julian , at Trafford University ; Dilman 's maiden aunt , Beatrice , in Los Angeles ; Dilman 's old sponsor and still political boss in his home state , the union leader , Slim Dubowsky ; Dilman 's tenant , the Reverend Paul Spinger ; Dilman 's acquaintance , the national chairman of the Party , Allan Noyes ; Dilman 's good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorney , Nathan Abrahams , in Chicago . " That 's about it , Leroy , " Dilman had said on that occasion . " Fact is , except maybe for Nat Abrahams , you yourself know me as well as , maybe better than , any of them . " Of this list of friends , Poole now saw , he himself was one of the three who were in Washington , near at hand , ready with friendship and counsel . In short , his association with Dilman could be turned to profit , now that Dilman was the head of the country . First off , the hack biography , since its subject was on all lips , would not be just another book that sold three thousand copies , but would be an intimate , inside look at a new President that might sell a hundred thousand copies . It could make Leroy Poole wealthy and give substance to his by-line . Second , and more important , far more important , there was his relationship with the President ; their scheduled meetings in the coming weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most powerful figure in the United States . Dilman , as Leroy Poole saw him , was a weak and tentative public servant , who had spent so many years mouthing the Party 's pronouncements that he had become a mere ventriloquist 's dummy for his white superiors . He was unoriginal , without a single dynamic or progressive idea or program of his own . His head was a receptacle of platitudes and ayes . But it was a head , and it could be filled with ideas by one near enough to him . The possibility excited Poole . With real effort he might make Dilman swallow , digest , and re-  | gurgitate the Turnerite demands for full equality now . And even more might be accomplished . Great Negroes  --  forceful ones , brilliant ones , like Jeff Hurley  --  might be appointed to high and key government offices , possible , possible , provided there was one at Dilman 's arm to guide him in the right direction , even push him ahead . Leroy Poole left the bathroom to answer the knock at the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role unique . At last , as never before , in a way more effective than his essays and books , or his work oii the Turnerite board , he could help pro-11 mote his people to their rightful place . IIe accepted the carton of ' tepid coffee , learning the cream and sugar were already in it , and the crushed doughnut , and reluctantly handed out a quarter and a half dollar for the breakfast and tip . After closing the door , he felt less worried about his extravagance . IIe was way up there now , potentially rich , potentially the savior of his people . Then , gradually , as he squatted on the armchair to drink his coffee and munch the tasteless doughnut , the conviction that he might serve himself and every Negro through Dilman became fainter . Dilman , no matter what had happened , was still no more than the man Poole had come to know and despise . Dilman was as scared of whites as Poole himself had once been . Dilman had never once tried to break out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toms and Aunt Jemimas . He was a figurehead fink , using his color in a state where it mattered , to gain office , rejecting his color in the gentleman 's Chamber of the Senate , where it mattered more . How could a person who trembled so constantly even hold onto a new idea ? How could a person always backing away from responsibility be reached ? In fact , Old Chub the Rabbit-hearted might even renege on the biography now , Poole realized with a shudder . In the last minutes , the biography had become as valuable to Leroy Poole as a First Folio Shakespeare . As an obscure senator , Dilman had been afraid of the biography , recoiling from any attention . It had taken the II intervention of the foremost Negro publisher in America , and pres " ' 1 sure from several Negro leaders , including Spinger , to convince Dilman that a short , innocuous , political biography would be more useful to him than harmful . Immediately after Poole had arrived in Washington , he had found Dilman reserved and tongue-tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led the Senator into discussions of his public career . Since the facts had been published , Dilman had proved easier , more amiable , more talkative . Recently Poole had led him back to his private life , and Dilman , at last conditioned to these interviews , more trusting of his interrogator ( who had not told him of his connection with the Turnerites ) , had been more helpful , but still not frank and open . If Dilman had been so timorous before , Poole wondered , how would he be now , when his every word might be examined by a suspicious or hostile citizenry ? Would he call Leroy Poole in and tell him that the project was finished ? Or would he simply evade Poole , postpone interviews , and allow the project to languish and die ? Leroy Poole put aside his coffee container , wiped the crumbs from his mouth as he brought the telephone to it , and put in a call for Dilman 's secretary , Diane Fuller , in the Old Senate Office Building . Told that her line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harassed voice , her speech ungrammatical as it was whenever she was under tension . Poole had always been flattering to the scrawny , nervous colored girl , because he had long ago learned that personal secretaries were important , sometimes alter egos , and even if Diane did not measure up , it paid to play it safe . As ever , Poole greeted her effusively , and congratulated her on the elevation of her boss . " Oh , what a day , " she groaned . " Everybody 's callin ' , and it ai n't ? is n't  --  no fun . I do n't know what 's goin ' on here , Leroy . " " Then I wo n't keep you , honey chile , " Leroy Poole said sympathetically . " I just want to know where I stand . I have an appointment with him day after tomorrow , around two in the afternoon . He was going to give me a full hour . But now that he 's moved from the Senate to the White House , I want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come . Has he had time to mention it ? " " Leroy , so much is happening , I have n't even seen him yet . Got to talk to him once on the phone , no more . I do n't know where he is or what he plans . I have your date on the calendar . First chance I get today or tomorrow , I 'll remind him . " " That 's my sweetie pie . And look , I want to be reasonable . The poor guy 's been hit on the head with a country . If he 's crowded day after tomorrow , you tell him I can wait . But try to get a firm appointment out of him for this week , even if it 's a shorter time . " " Sure thing , Leroy . I 'll call you . . . whoa , there 's three other phones . Good-bye . "  | Leroy Poole sat back deeper in the chair , still holding the telephone in his lap . Of course , he had almost enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dilman . He could see other people , which he had not done yet , and use clippings . Still , that was not the point . He wanted to maintain his person-to-person contact with Dilman . I-Ic must fight for nothing less . The telephone in his lap shrilled at him , and he juggled it , undoing the receiver , then retrieved it . " Yeh , hello ? " " Mr. Poole ? Sally Watson again . Remember , you told me I could call back . " " That 's right . " Have you heard the news for yourself by now ? " " Miss Watson , I not only heard the news , I 'm trying to make some of it myself , " he said cockily . " It 's quite an experience , having someone you know , someone you 're dealing with , become President . " " That 's why I 'm calling you , Mr. Poole . I hope I 'm not being presumptuous . If I am , you tell me . To be perfectly honest , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I do  --  I 've read so much of your work  --  I want to ask a favor of you . " She paused . " There , I 've said it . " He puzzled over what on earth he could possibly do for a rich white girl whose father was a senior powerhouse in the Senate . " You name it , Miss Watson . If it 's something I can do , I 'll be glad to oblige . " " I mean , I do n't go around asking people favors like this , " she said . " I 've never done this before . But maybe you wo n't mind . I know a lot of people on my own . Maybe one day I can be of help to you  --  not that you need it , with your genius . " Impatience nudged Leroy Poole 's curiosity . " Like I said , name it . " She seemed to exhale her request through the earpiece . " I want you to help me get a job with President Dilman . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Why , I do n't know that I have all that much standing with him , Miss Watson , " he said . " Ca n't your father do that better for you ? After all , they were fellow senators , on the same side of the aisle . " " Yes , I know , " she said hastily , " but that would be awkward for a hundred reasons . Besides , my father does n't know President Dilman as well as you do , and even if he did , it would be a little difficult for him to pop right in and ask for Party patronage . " Her tone  | became a plea . " You 'll be with the President constantly . It would be easy for you . I 'm sure he 'd listen . " Leroy Poole straightened , gratified to have become Dilman 's adviser . He weighed her request . Her background was important . Intervening on her behalf was no skin off his ass . You did a favor , you had a debtor . It was good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he saw him  --  he could just toss it out , and if Dilman said yes or no , at least he had his debtor . " Miss Watson , I think you 'd better tell me , what kind of job have you got in mind ? " " I want to be his social secretary . " " Forgive me for being naive , Miss Watson , but exactly what does that mean ? " " Every President has a White House social secretary . Sometimes his wife has one , too . But now there 's no First Lady , so the President will need someone competent and experienced for both jobs . The social secretary helps the President with his  --  well , his social life , getting up lists , sending invitations , calling around to arrange cocktail parties , dinners , informal gatherings in the White House . Both T.C. and President Johnson had marvelous social secretaries , but President Dilman needs someone even better . His problems are more complex . Not having a wife or daughter , he 'll have to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well , the fact that he is colored , he may want someone who  --  well , Mr. Poole , you know  --  who is understanding , and so forth . I fill the bill . " She had entered Poole 's grounds , and he challenged her . " Where you from , Miss Watson ? " She sounded disconcerted . " You mean where I was born and raised ? I was born in Louisiana . My mother lives in New Orleans . Well , now she 's in Rome , but  --  and my father , well , you know , he 's ? " " How 's it going to look , Miss Watson , a daughter of the Confederacy working so close to a Negro ? " " I told you how I feel . I do n't have those die-hard sentiments . I was educated in the East . You saw me at the party last night . I like your people . " " I do n't mean how 's it going to look to you , Miss Watson . I mean how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Dilman took you on , do you think your father 'd allow it ? " " Mr. Poole , not my father , not anyone , waves me around like a Confederate flag , " she said with a tinge of anger . " I 'm over twenty-  | one . I 'm an American like you and the President . I belong to me and I do as I please . I want a job where my background can be useful . I think that 's the right job for me . Above all , I think I might be of use to the President . I can send you a resume of my experience and abilities , to show to him . I can send you a list of persons , high up as Cabinet members , who would recommend me . Wo n't you help me ? " " Miss Watson , I like your sound , and I dig you . Yes , I 'll try to make a pitch for you . I 'll do my best . " " When ? Do you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else begins pestering him . " " I 'm supposed to see him this week . If we speak on the phone earlier , I 'll mention you right off . Like I said , I 'll do my best . Whatever happens , I 'll call you . " " Let me give you my number ? " " Wait , I do n't have a pencil . " " Well , no matter , I have my own phone . I 'm listed as Watson , Sally , in the Arlington book . I do n't know how to thank you enough . " " Only thank me if I 'm lucky . If I am , just see that I 'm invited to one of those White House dinners someday . " " I 'll do more . I 'll have hundreds of copies of your book there , waiting to be signed . Thanks , Mr. Poole . I 'll be living by the phone . Good-bye . " Setting down the telephone , Leroy Poole crossed to the cheap pine desk on which his portable typewriter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mention Sally Watson to Dilman , if and when . He then knelt , opened his suitcase under the desk , and pulled out two unwieldy legal-sized manila folders . One contained the typed transcript of his interviews with Douglass Dilman . The other was filled with typed research notes , newspaper clippings , photostats of magazine articles , and mimeographed handouts , all giving data on Dilman and his public record , on the Senate 's rules and history , and on Dilman 's home state and its politics ; and there was also associated material on other Negroes who had served , or were currently serving , in Congress . Returning to the armchair , he set the research folder on the floor and opened the folder of typed transcripts before him . He put aside the pages covered with penciled no*s of his last talk with Dilman , four days ago , which still had to be typed . He began to  | st ncly what had already been typed , the result of at least two dozen sessions with Oilman , his questions , Dilman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hastily heo closed the folder , shoved it between his leg and the arm of the chair , and brought the receiver before him , hoping that this was the call he wanted . " Yeh , hello ? " " This is Memphis , Tennessee , long-distance operator . Is this Mr. I.croy Poole ? " " Right . " " Please hold on a moment . Your line was busy . I 'll have to ring your party . " " Operator , who 's calling ? " " Uh  --  Mr. Jefferson Hurley . One moment , please . " Leroy Poole could feel the smile creasing in his face . Hurley had not neglected him after all . Busy as he was , having moved from Topeka down to Memphis , obviously to set up a base closer to Hattiesburg , Mississippi , Hurley still had found time to consult with him . Poole gloried and preened at the compliment , not so much of being a member of the Turnerite inner circle as in being Jeff Hurley 's friend . Waiting to hear the deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he visualized Jeff Hurley , whom he had seen too infrequently in the three years since they had met at a Crispus Society meeting on New York 's East Side . Hurley was a beautiful giant , at thirty-three but a year older than Poole , a self-educated , spellbinding , coffeecolored genius , determined and fearless , cleverer than any white man , unafraid of any human being , white or black . The Turnerite Group had been Hurley 's creation , hewed from the Crispus Society 's dead heartwood , a great and pulsating splinter committee secretly set upon a course of direct and immediate action to achieve equality now . Hurley had given the Group its arrogant name because of his admiration for the brave Negro farmer and preacher , Nat Turner , who had dared to rebel against Virginia slavery in 1831 . With five followers Turner had ranged through Southampton County , a vengeful black Moses determined to lead his children out of Egypt to freedom , and in the course of his rebellion he had slaughtered sixty whites . Freedom had not been won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from retaliation , but a point had been made . Never again would the South feel safe with its slaves .  | Hurley 's Turnerites wished to make no point . They desired to lead no chosen people to a Promised Land . Their goal was to make the United States that Promised Land , the one promised in the Constitution , and to do so by force , if necessary . The black-hooded picketing yesterday , in Ilatticsburg , Mississippi , had been their first move . If it , or the Turnerite actions to follow , were thwarted , Hurley had promised , like the white Moses of the Jews , like the Moses of the blacks , Nat Turner , to respond with " an eye for an eye . " The Southern leaders had ranted against Hurley , the Northern leaders had chastised him for intemperance and impatience , and Spingcr 's Crisp 's Society ( in which many Turnerites still retained membership ) had pleaded with him to observe due process of the law . Now , in Hattiesburg , Hurley and his Group had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still recalled 1lrrrley 's fiery press pronouncements would be wondering : Would his Old Testament warning be acted out ? Waiting at the telephone , Leroy Poole had no doubts . In all communities of people , you separated the men from the boys by determining which were the doers and which the talkers . Hurley was a doer . Leroy Poole adored him . It was not only Hurley 's authority that appealed to Poole , but the gorgeous physical aspect of the man , his short-cropped , glossy dark hair , his liquid brooding eyes , his aquiline nose , his gleaming teeth . This was the human being Leroy Poole wanted to be , but since the metamorphosis was an impossibility , it gratified Poole simply to stand beside that human being forever . For Poole , the best safety that he had ever known had been that offered by Hurley 's mammoth arm around him , Hurley 's hearty laughter , Hurley 's electrifying instructions . Leroy Poole had given only a part of himself , in friendship , to many black men and a few black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not ) was the only one of either sex for whom he would have given his life . From far Memphis he felt Hurley enfold him . " Leroy ? You there ? " " Jeff  --  Jeff  --  how are you ? " " I guess I 'm the guy who knows the guy who knows the new President of the United States . How about that , Leroy ? Speak of shocks ? " " I still ca n't believe it . " " I do n't know the reaction up your way , but down here you 'd think old Nat Turner himself had overthrown the government of  | the United States . Almost every Memphis white is apoplectic . Even here on Beale Street our brothers are numbed , full of joy and fireworks inside but afraid to display it . " " The question is  --  what do you think , Jeff ? " " I do n't know what to think yet . I know nothing about Dilman except for a couple of cracks you 've made in your letters . I gather you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called him a doughface . " " Did I ? Well , maybe that was too strong . He does n't exactly support the Southerners . Up to now I 've just sort of felt he was less interested in equality than in self-survival . You know , Jeff , the kind of person who does n't even want to stop and help out when he sees someone in trouble or being wrongly hurt . He just wants to be left alone . Maybe that was understandable yesterday , but today 's a new day , and he 'll find no one 's going to leave him alone . What it comes to is who 's going to get to him first and strongest , and then he 's going to have to show if he 's nothing but a scarecrow stuffed full of bought ballots or if he 's a colored man with guts . I do n't have high hopes , Jeff . " The voice from Memphis was momentarily still . Poole waited patiently , and at last he heard Hurley speak . " We 'll see soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our man into another hankyhead . Things are moving fast , Leroy , and we 're not letting anyone ignore them . " " That was awful , what happened down there in Hattiesburg . Was someone really blinded ? " " Yes , Simon was , poor bastard . Completely sightless , of all the rotten things . And Marvin 's sustained a skull fracture , but he 'll live . The other ten are okay , as okay as anyone can be in those stinking cell blocks . " " When are they going to be let out ? " " Let out ? " Hurley snorted bitterly . " They come up for sentencing in a day or two ? " " They come up for sentencing ? " Leroy Poole shouted . " Je-sus , what did they do but peaceably picket in some Halloween costumes ? What about the Grand Dragon who threw the ? " " Leroy , Leroy , you know better than that . Those folks ca n't do anything wrong , just like we ca n't do anything right . The charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace , inciting a riot , assault and battery  --  you name it ; whatever 's in the book is being thrown at them . Worst of all , a county judge named Everett  | Gage is going to be on the bench , reading the sentence . We 've got the biography on him . Twice in ten years he let off proven lynchers . And they 've built a special cemetery , in some swamp , just to hold the Negroes he 's sentenced to hard labor . " " What are you going to do , Jeff ? " " I 'm heading down to Little Rock in an hour , and if Judge Gage does what 's expected , I 'll probably set up a base of operations in Shreveport . Then , if necessary , some of us 'll do what has to be done . " " You mean ? ? " " Yes , that 's right . " Leroy Poole was suddenly unnerved . " Jeff , one thing . You talk about the sentencing . Did n't our boys plead Not Guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what about the trial first ? " " I omitted it to save long-distance charges . Leroy , you 've been away from your South too long . " " Yeh . " Hurley 's voice came on more forcefully . " There is one thing that does count , and that 's an appeal carried on our behalf by an important attorney . Something to stir up pressure , force them into second thoughts , into moderation . That 's primarily why I called you . " " What can I do , Jeff ? " " I 'll tell you what I 've done , and what you can do . You 've heard of Nat Abrahams ? ? " " The lawyer ? " " The one who got those Mexicans off in California , and did that great job for the NAACP in Ohio . I tried to get through to him in Chicago . He was gone . His associate , fellow named Hart , said he was on his way to Washington . I explained the urgency of our case , and asked where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was turning down all criminal cases , was involved with something new in your city . Leroy , I 'd like to ? " Poole interrupted , remembering what had been nagging at him as he listened . " Wait , Jeff , something just came to mind . This Nat Abrahams , he 's the one  --  when Oilman gave me the names of relatives and friends to interview , he named Nat Abrahams of Chicago as one of his best friends . " Hurley whistled . " Great . Better than I hoped for . I was going to ask you to look up Abrahams when he arrives , make a special plea  | for hirn to intervene for us on the appeal . But this is better , much better . ' . When are you seeing Dilman again ? " " Well , now that he 's become President ? " " gee him . " It was a command , and Leroy Poole came to attentionj . " See him , " Hurley repeated , " and when you see him , make sure he knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's happened to his people . Tell him you 'd like him to get his friend Nat Abrahams to give us a little help . Tell him we 're desperate , anything you like . We need Abrahams , and no matter how busy he is , I ca n't see him saying no to the President of the United States . " Poole was worried . " I ca n't see Abrahams saying no to Dilman either , but I sure can see Dilman saying no to me . You should look at the notes of my talks with Dilman . He 's chicken . He 's a let's-makehaste-slowly fink . " " Did you ever feel him out on the Turnerites ? " " I sure did . He hemmed and hawed , weaseling all the way . It 's in my notes . " Hurley 's tone had become fiercer . " Send me a copy of your notes on Dilman . Everything . In return , I 'll send you something today , some information that 'll maybe help you turn Dilman from a chicken to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any way you can . Get your man in the White House to deliver Abrahams to us . If you succeed , you 've done a great service for us , and we 've got a real fighting chance . " " What if I ca n't make it , Jeff ? " " Then we 're going all the way , like we agreed . " " I  --  I 'd hate that , Jeff . " " You think I 'd like it ? But it 's that or nothing now . We 've been knocked around long enough . Maybe it 's time we punch back hard . " " All right , Jeff . " " First things first . Before you pitch the President , make sure Nat Abrahams is in Washington . Once you 're sure , you get in there with Dilman , because right now it 's either the lawyer way or the other way , one or the other , but whichever , it 's got to be fast . We 're going fast from here on in . " Even an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a swaying , speeding train . Ridding oneself of a thick stubble , while in rapid transit , required the steady hand of a surgeon and  | the concentration of a yogi . He possessed neither attribute this sulky gray morning . He blamed his unsure hand and his wandering mind on the stunning news that he had heard in Akron last night . He had been up half the night with it , following its implications along every dead-end tangent , and back again , and over again , and a few hours ' sleep had not alleviated the disturbance . Grunting surrender , Nat Abrahams gave up . Unplugging the cord , wrapping it around the electric razor , he considered the results of his shaving in the dim yellow mirror of the cramped , rattling compartment lavatory . A sadly une'ren job , but then God had been there first , he decided wryly . No electric gadgetry could smooth the Maker 's work . Nor did Nat Abrahams really care much . The twin in the mirror with its shock of unruly brown hair , lined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between high cheekbones , amused mouth , prominent jaw , all gaunt , sallow , keen , had been faithful friend and partner through most of his quixotic idiocies and adventures for most of his years . The six-feet-and-one-inch twin  --  not only the face , but the lanky , ungainly , sinewy structure appended to it  --  had frightened off few clients ( well , maybe a few fastidious ones ) , lost few juries , antagonized few judges . It had won him Sue . It had collaborated to gain him mighty pleasures and minor reputation . Who could ask for anything more ? He smiled with self-mockery . Who could ask for anything more ? He could . He could ask for one thing more  --  money  --  money , and plenty of it . The unselfish need of it , after years of treating it as a time-wasting intruder , was the only thing on earth that could have put him on this rushing train from Chicago to Washington , D.C. , in his busiest August yet . He had turned over his crowded calendar to Felix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their grandmother , he had dragged Sue away from her thousand wife-mother activities , to obtain what he had spent a lifetime ignoring : the pot of gold that had become a necessity at last . Nothing but necessity would have sent him careening forth on this questionable treasure hunt . Nat Abrahams reached down , pulled up his suspenders , and snapped them over his shoulders . The suspenders , regarded by his opponents as a corny affectation , had become so much a part of him now that he was hardly aware of them . When he was aware , he was happy to remember that they were not and had never been an affectation . In his first year in law school he had purchased his  | first pair and worn them as a talisman , to help him attain and honor the kind of shingle he had always wanted : Lincoln , of Lincoln &; Herndon , Counselors , or Darrow , of Darrow &; Sissman , Attorneys-at-Law . He had deserved half of neither shingle , he was certain , but he was equally certain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lincoln and Darrow . Yet this morning the suspenders felt as tight and uncomfortable as a guilty conscience . Was the journey to Washington right for him ? The cardiac specialist , his old friend Greenberg , had reiterated that there was no choice . " Nat , surely the American Bar Association does not disapprove of its members being well paid . So why all the Old Country guilts ? Enough already . Your whole life you have lived by the Golden Rule , Do unto others as you would have them do unto you . ' So now it 's time to do unto yourself as you have done unto others . Survival , Nat , not at any price , no , but what Avery Emmich offers is not any price , but your price , your terms . Younger men with younger hearts will swing your broadsword to protect every minority , every civil liberty , so let go , let them . You have had your warning , one early coronary insufficiency . Not every man is so lucky . So do what I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crusade . Go to Washington , sign the contract , make the fortune , and then come back and buy the farm . Live so your children can honor their father , not his tombstone . Go to Washington , Nat . " The words rang in his ears , in duet with the train 's whistle . Well , if he was nothing else , he was obedient . Flere he was , on the Capitol Limited , little more than one hour from Washington 's Union Station . He left the lavatory and groped his way into the compartment bedroom , where only the tiny bed light over his upper berth and the slit of morning beneath the green shade provided visibility . He took down his vest , and then his suit coat , and pulled them on . Fixing the silver watch chain , he squinted to make out the time . Yes , one hour and five minutes more to Washington . He bent to see if Sue was awake . Her back was to him . Her small , fragile face was buried in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He listened to her inhale and exhale , and loved her now as he had for every moment of their eighteen years . She was so sound asleep , so far from turmoil , and he regretted having kept her awake last night with the news that he had heard in Akron . He touched her bare shoulder . " Sue , darling ? "  | Her shoulder lifted , fell , and her head , eyes still shut , came around . " Mmm ? " " Time to wake up . We 're almost there . " " Thanks . " " Are you awake , Sue ? " " I 'm fine . " " You 've got an hour to dress . If you make it fast , you can join me for breakfast . The diner 's two cars back . I 'll be there . " " Okay . " He straightened , flexed his shoulder muscles , picked up his attache case , and went to the door . " Nat ? " IIe halted , returned , to find her on an elbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nat , is it true , what you told me last night  --  or was I dreaming ? " " You were n't dreaming , dear . " ' Ilf " No , " she said slowly . " I was afraid of that . Poor Doug in the White House . I do n't mean just that he 's colored . It 's that he 's so ? so sensitive and  --  and withdrawn . Nat , they 'll crucify him . " Abrahams frowned . " He 's tougher than a lot of people think , and smarter , too . " He paused . " Maybe it 's the best thing that could have happened  --  I mean , to the country . " " Do you really believe that ? " " Honey , " he said evasively , " I never know absolutely what I believe until I 've had breakfast and a pipeful . You ask me then . Now , hurry up . I 'll see you in the diner . " Once he was alone in the train corridor , wending his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he did believe . Stopping before the last window , he placed a palm against the glass pane , briefly conscious of the blur of green trees flashing past him , but soon inattentive to the scenery . His mind 11 had gone back to the scene he had witnessed at the depot , during the time of their departure yesterday . When he and Sue had boarded the Capitol Limited in Chicago ten minutes before it left at three-forty yesterday afternoon , they had already known of the President 's sudden death in Frankfurt . All through the depot , and outside the train , and in the train itself , Abrahams had seen in the expressions of passengers and porters the same evidences of disbelief and anguish that he had observed that other terrible time when President John F. Kennedy 's life had been extinguished by an assassin 's bullet in Dallas .  | Pushing himself away from the window , Abrahams tried to sort out the different qualities of grief . He felt sure that the public had reacted to T.C. 's death in Frankfurt in very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy 's death in I ) allas , which was considerably different from public reaction to Franklin D. Roosevelt 's death in Warm Springs . T.C. had been almost as youthful as Kennedy , and as vigorous . Most people had regarded T.C. more as an older brother than as a father , because he had been their Chief Executive less than three years and they had not become totally dependent upon him . His sudden death had shaken them badly  --  that was evident everywhere yesterday  --  but what seemed to shake them more was the realization that invincible youth and strength , carrying hope and ambition , shielded by the indestructibility of success and power , could be brought down and stamped out so swiftly and easily . Thus , Abrahams guessed , public lamentation had taken on the form of disbelief . When Roosevelt died  --  and this , too , Abrahams remembered very well  --  the President had been an intimate part of people 's lives and experiences for so many years that the loss had been not only the loss of the everpresent head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segment of his personal life . After their train left Chicago , Nat and Sue Abrahams had talked over the tragedy and its meaning at length , and pored over the latest newspapers , and then he had devoted himself to his work . While Abrahams had voted for T.C. , supported him , he had felt no passionate involvement with him , and so he suffered no feeling of passionate loss . He had thought , as he worked over his notes for the Washington meeting with Gorden Oliver , Emmich 's lobbyist there , that MacPherson might do the job as well as T.C. had done . There would be no national trauma . The rest of the short afternoon on the train had been lost to working , napping , reading , and desultory chatter about the children , the new position that was in the offing , the utopia that was possible after that . They had gone to the lounge for martinis , and then eaten too much dinner . Abrahams had seen Sue back to their compartment , where the berths were already made . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would read some more , and go to sleep early . With his attache case he had returned to the lounge car to study the proposals from Emmich 's attorneys , to mark modifications and changes after them . He had hardly been aware that they were  | in Akron , and that it was eleven-fifteen and they were running a little late . But then , casually peering through the window , he had noticed , with growing curiosity , a large gathering of the train 's porters and conductors , and lips moving excitedly and considerable gesticulating from everyone . Minutes later , as the Capitol Limited had begun to move again , the wizened Negro bartender had hurried into the lounge with the news . MacPherson had also died in Frankfurt . Senator Douglass Dilman , a colored man , had just been sworn in as President of the United States . Doug Dilman . It had taken Nat Abrahams a long time to calm the chaotic emotions he had felt about his old friend and his friend 's incredible promotion . At midnight Abrahams had gone back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice welcomed him and said good night . He had sat down on the edge of her berth , and told her what he had heard . She had snapped on the blue night light above her head , and he could see that she was upset and trembling . He had given her a sleeping pill , and then they had discussed it , until her voice had thickened and fallen silent , and she had drifted off to sleep again . Later he had stretched in his upper berth , but he had not slept . He had been awake , his mind a turmoil , for at least an hour after they left Pittsburgh . And here it was early morning , and here he was drawing closer and closer to the nation 's capital , a city so jolted overnight , so changed , by the rise to highest office of the only colored man he had ever known well and one who had been his friend since their first meeting during the Second World War . Only the previous week Abrahams had had a letter from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington . Dilman insisted that they must see one another as often as possible during Abrahams ' visit . Dilman had even set a date for their dinner of reunion . Abrahams speculated as to whether that engagement still existed and , if it did , what his friend would be like . Sighing , Nat Abrahams drove further speculation from his mind and walked quickly , opening heavy resisting doors , into the lounge car , and then continued into the immaculate dining car . Except for a sprinkling of white passengers , absorbed in the Pittsburgh newspapers , the dining car appeared to be the scene of a Pullman porters ' convention . At least a half dozen of them , joined by the  | Negro waiters , were congregated at the far end , engaged in deep conversation . The short maitre d'hotel , rimless spectacles pressed into his Prussian face , bounced forward , signaling Abrahams to a table . As A hrahams sat before the spotless water glasses and gleaming silverware , dancing to the click of the wheels and rails , the maitre d'liotel placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . " I wo n't need a menu , " Abrahams said . Taking up the pad , he wrote his order : cereal , French toast , tea . Then he filled in Sue 's order : grapefruit , melba toast , coffee . He handed the pad to his host . " Hold the coffee until my wife comes in . " " Very well , sir . " Abrahams nodded off to the far end of the car . " I 'll wager they 're talking about President Dilman . " " Nothing else but that . They ca n't keep their minds on their work since it happened . " He bowed closer to Abrahams and whispered , " You 'd think it was the Second Coming . " " Let 's hope so . " The maitre d ' was about to say something , but seemed to change his mind , and said something else . " Are you , by any chance , with the government , sir ? " " Heaven forbid , " said Abrahams , " unless that covers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 're expecting our next trainloads , the coming months , to be more heavily Negro , if you know what I mean . " " I do n't see why , " said Abrahams sharply . He motioned to the pad . " May I have my tea right away ? " After the maitre d ' had hurried away , Abrahams remained inspecting the picture that the man had planted in his mind  --  thousands of Pullman cars , overflowing with black men pouring into Washington to accept their new appointments . However , he could only visualize the picture in broadest caricature . For , knowing Dilman as he did , he was aware that it was wildly ridiculous . One of Dilman 's shortcomings , Abrahams had always felt , was that he leaned too far backward , and away , from those worthies of his own race , lest he be charged with favoritism . Dilman believed that all men were created equal , and should inherit equal rights , yet he was too inhibited by fear to practice his beliefs . Instead he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one turned in-  | side out . This was too harsh a judgment of so good and suffering a man , Abrahams knew , but it was largely true . His memory went back to early 1945 , when , as a captain , he had been assigned to the Military Justice Division of the Judge Advocate General 's Corps , Department of the Army , in the Pentagon Building . He had found himself situated at a desk in the same glassed-in olive green cubbyhole as Lieutenant Douglass Dilman . Abrahams had known a few Negroes when he attended the Law School of the University of Chicago , but he had never known them intimately . Abrahams had never possessed any strong , special feelings about Negroes , except intellectual resentment at their oppression and slum history and bondage in America . His bookish , impecunious father , a philosophy professor , and his active-in-causes , fearlessly vocal mother ( a sort of Margaret Fuller whose Master 's thesis had been on the Abolitionist movement ) had raised him so naturally that he had come to manhood without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not even possessed of tolerance for Negroes , as many of his intellectual and progressive friends were . To Abrahams , the word tolerance bore , in itself , a flick of prejudice  --  one was nice to certain people , treated them equally , accepted them , but by being tolerant of them thus , one implied that they were different . To Abrahams , Negroes had been men who were light black or dark black as white men had been swarthy white or pasty white . All men were men together , and some were stupid and others were intelligent , some more boring than others and some more fascinating , some more bad than good and others more good than bad , whether they were black or white , brown or yellow . Abrahams had entered the Army with this attitude , and it had not changed . Being confined in a cubbyhole with a Negro officer had been unusual only because he found Dilman shy and deferential beyond the requirements of their difference in rank , and because he had been uncertain about Dilman . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's color , but rather to Dilman 's own sensitivity about his color and to Abrahams ' whiteness . But because they had been thrown together a couple of feet from each other , devoting themselves to the same cases and working under the same pressures , Dilman 's defensiveness had gradually dropped . Their closeness had begun in the common language of military legalities , and had eventually shifted to the common language of intellectually equal men . Not only had they worked together , but  | they had dined in the Pentagon cafeteria together daily and left the river entrance together in one car pool for their respective lodgings . They had come to know of each other 's lives , although Dilman had always been more guarded here , and of each other 's likes and dislikes , human weaknesses , human aspirations . They had become fond of each other as men , and when they had been assigned together to London , and then Paris , and then Occupied West Germany , their friendship had solidified . The triumph of it , Abrahams had finally realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him white and therefore alien . After the war they had both practiced in Chicago , he with offices in the Loop , and Dilman on the South Side . While he had known that Dilman was married , he had never met Dilman 's wife during the war , because she had not accompanied him to Washington . In Chicago Abrahams met her three times and , knowing Dilman as he did , understood why Dilman had not brought her with him to Washington . Aldora Dilman , although of Negro ancestry , had proved to be of fair complexion . Abrahams had thought her tense , embittered , ashamed of her darker husband , and he had observed that she drank too much . Eleven months after setting himself up in Chicago , Dilman had abruptly moved himself and his wife to another city in another Midwestern state . Occasionally , in the next years , Abrahams had his reunions with Dilman , often going out of his way to enjoy one . After an initial constraint , Dilman had always accepted him as an old friend . Abrahams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and great labor unions . He had not been surprised when he read that Dilman had agreed to run for the House of Representatives , and he had been thrilled when Dilman won . Since Abrahams ' cases had often taken him to Washington , D.C. , he had been able to see his old friend more frequently . In these meetings , during which almost every subject was covered , Abrahams had learned to avoid one area , although he perceived much about it . He had silently understood Aldora 's refusing to accompany her Congressman husband to Washington . He had been pleased to learn , indirectly , that Aldora had given Dilman a son some years before . And it had come to him as no shock , somehow , when Aldora died at the age of forty . He offered Dilman no words of sympathy . He had always known that this dark area of
