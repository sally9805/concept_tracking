In a time of swords , men dream of plowshares . For much of mankind the dream has seldom been as fervent - or as elusive-as it is today . History 's greatest tyranny enslaves half the globe ; science and technology offer not only the promise of poverty and hunger conquered but also the threat of civilization destroyed . Each day , from Selma to Saigon , brings evidence that man exists in a climate of risk . Last week the United Nations , which had earlier designated 1965 as International Cooperation Year , reached a stalemate and adjourned for six months . <P> These overtones of violence and disorder gave all the more meaning to a unique , three-day meeting last week at the New York Hilton Hotel . There , under the auspices of Educator Robert Hutchins ' Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions , scores of statesmen , diplomats , theologians and philosophers met to discuss the means and methods of bringing peace to the world . The participants included Protestants , Buddhists , agnostics and atheists ; but the framework for their thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XXIII 's encyclical Pacem in Terris ( Peace on Earth ) . <P> The relevance of that vision was summed up by Vice President Hubert Humphrey at the opening session . " John XXIII presented to the world a public philosophy for a nuclear era , " said Humphrey . " It represents not a Utopian blueprint for world peace , presupposing a sudden change in the nature of man . Rather , it represents a call to leaders of nations , presupposing only a gradual change in human institutions . It is not confined to elaborating the abstract virtues of peace , but looks to the building of a world community governed by institutions capable of preserving peace . We honor Pope John XXIII on this occasion not because he demonstrated that perfect peace can be achieved in a short time . We honor him because he raised our hopes and exalted our vision . It is the duty of our generation to convert this vision of peace into reality . " <P> <P> " Time presses , " declared Robert Hutchins in his opening address . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace , on a level somewhere between apathy and panic - and this side of the irrelevance of propaganda . " <P> The conversation took place three times a day , and it involved an exotic mixture of personalities . On the dais waiting to deliver their addresses , Protestant Theologian Paul Tillich sat with that outrider of neutralism , Nobel-prize-winning Chemist Linus Pauling . At another panel , Kremlinologist George Kennan , onetime Ambassador to Russia and Yugoslavia , clashed with Dr. Adam Schaff , the leading Marxist theoretician of Poland . <P> <P> In the audience of more than 1,500 , television 's Steve Allen was wedged one afternoon between two intent nuns ; U.S. Communist Boss Gus Hall amiably discussed the significance of a speech with his neighbor , a Catholic priest . The meeting also proved a magnet for pacifists and peace marchers ; sprinkled heavily throughout the listening throng , they cheered at every hint of banning the bomb .
