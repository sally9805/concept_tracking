At a closed-door session on Capitol Hill last week , Secretary of State Christian Herter made his final report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on U.S. affairs abroad . Afterward , Tennessee 's Democratic Senator Albert Gore summed it up for newsmen . What Herter presented , said Gore , was " not a very encouraging review . " That was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the West and Communism erupted on three fronts . While Communists were undermining United Nations efforts to rescue the Congo from chaos , two other Communist offensives stirred the Eisenhower Administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions . <P> 1 ) CUBA . Hours after a parade of his new Soviet tanks and artillery . Dictator Fidel Castro suddenly confronted the U.S. with a blunt and drastic demand : within 48 hours , the U.S. had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in Cuba to a total of eleven persons ( the embassy staff alone totaled 87 U.S. citizens , plus 120 Cuban employees ) . President Eisenhower held an 8:30 a.m. meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off diplomatic relations immediately . " There is a limit to what the United States in self-respect can endure , " said the President . " That limit has now been reached . " <P> Through Secretary Herter , Ike offered President-elect Kennedy an opportunity to associate his new Administration with the breakoff decision . Kennedy , through Secretary-designate of State Dean Rusk , declined . He thus kept his hands free for any action after Jan. 20 , although reaction to the break was generally favorable in the U.S. and Latin America ( see THE HEMISPHERE ) . <P> 2 ) LAOS . After a White House huddle between the President and top lieutenants , the Defense Department reacted sharply to a cry from the pro-Western government of Laos that several battalions of Communist troops had invaded Laos from North Viet Nam . " In view of the present situation in Laos , " said the Pentagon 's announcement , " we are taking normal precautionary actions to increase the readiness of our forces in the Pacific . " Cutting short a holiday at Hong Kong , the aircraft carriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , accompanied by a swarm of destroyers , plus troopships loaded with marines . On the U.S. 's island base of Okinawa , Task Force 116 , made up of Army , Navy , Marine and Air Force units , got braced to move southward on signal . <P> But by week 's end the Laotian cry of invasion was read as an exaggeration ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) , and the U.S. was agreeing with its cautious British and French allies that a neutralist-rather than a pro-Western-government might be best for Laos . <P> French &; Indians . There was a moral of sorts in the Laotian situation that said much about all other cold-war fronts . Political , economic and military experts were all agreed that chaotic , mountainous little Laos was the last place in the world to fight a war-and they were probably right . " It would be like fighting the French and Indian War all over again , " said one military man . But why was Laos the new Southeast Asian battleground ?            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
