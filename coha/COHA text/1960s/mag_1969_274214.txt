In the hot Paris summer of 1794 , the fall of Robespierre signaled the end of the Reign of Terror and opened a fresh era of calm and consolidation . It was the year II in the new French revolutionary calendar , and the month was named Thermidor . In his classic analysis , The Anatomy of Revolution , the late Harvard historian Crane Brinton called Thermidor " a convalescence from the fever of revolution . " <P> THE American racial revolt of the 1960s has in no sense been a full-scale upheaval like the French Revolution . Yet it can be said that in the relatively cool American summer of 1969 , a Thermidor convalescence from the long fever of racial tumult seems to be under way . There has been no wholesale rioting in the black ghettos of the U.S. since the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr . in April 1968 . By a Department of Justice count , the number of racial disturbances of all sizes has fallen off sharply in 1969 from the two previous summers ( see chart , next page ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $40 million in property damage ; 43 died in the Detroit riots of 1967 and damage there was also $40 million . This summer 's biggest outbreak was a three-night June melee without fatalities in Omaha that destroyed $750,000 worth of property . <P> There were disturbing Labor Day incidents last week in Hartford , Conn. , Camden , N.J. , and Fort Lauderdale , Fla . In the present calm context , they seem somehow atavistic-only smaller recurrences in lesser cities of the convulsions that racked major metropolises much earlier . The whites and blacks of minor urban centers are still learning the lessons that have brought a hopeful Thermidor transformation to cities already tempered in destructive flames . For New York , Newark , Chicago , Los Angeles , Cleveland and Detroit , it was the fire last time-and those cities may have profited from the experience . <P> Temporary Immunization . It is perhaps only coincidence that none of the cities inoculated by major riot have yet suffered a second big outbreak ; in the curious chemistry of violence , they seem to have achieved at least a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems of the nation 's blacks have been solved , and no one yet dares predict what may come after the Thermidor pause is over. * But governments and ghettos alike have become more sophisticated and skillful at handling their common difficulties . Expressing a widespread view , Jack Meltzer , director of the University of Chicago Center for Urban Studies , observes : " The black community realizes that riots hurt them more than help them . " <P> There are good reasons for guarded hope . Many new elements , some constructive , some negative , explain the relative quiescence of the black ghetto this summer . Among them :
