PRO BASKETBALL <P> The kind of person who sits through the same movie three times loves pro basketball . The script is always the same ( When was the last time the Boston Celtics lost the championship ? ) , and the faces are familiar : Bill Russell , Wilt Chamberlain , Oscar Robertson . Nor was it news last week when those perennial cellar dwellers , the New York Knicks , lost their sixth out of seven games , 115-109 to the Cincinnati Royals . All in all , the new National Basketball Association season was more of the same , with one big exception : the sensational shooting of San Francisco 's Rick Barry . <P> A stringy , 6-ft. 7-in. forward who was the No. 1 college scorer at the University of Miami two years ago , Barry , 22 , is the deadliest " gunner " to hit the N.B.A. since Oscar Robertson in 1960 . Last season he averaged 25.7 points a game , was voted N.B.A. Rookie of the Year . Star rookies often suffer from " the sophomore jinx " during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basket at a fantastic rate . Last week he poured in 40 points as the San Francisco Warriors beat the Baltimore Bullets 120-110 . After 21 games , Rick was averaging 38.5 points per game-almost seven points more than Cincinnati 's Robertson and 14 points ahead of Wilt ( " The Stilt " ) Chamberlain , the N.B.A. 's all-time top scorer . And so the Warriors were leading the Western Division by two games . <P> Despite his height , Barry is hardly a giant by pro standards ; although he collects his share of " garbage " points at close range , he is also an accurate outside shooter , leads all N.B.A. players with a record of 88% at the free-throw line . ( Chamberlain , by contrast , has hit on only 38% . ) Rick perfected his long-range shooting in off-season practice sessions with his wife Pamela , the daughter of Miami Coach Bruce Hale . " We played a game against each other , " he says . " I would only shoot from 20 or 25 ft. out , and Pam would take shots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few times-but that 's not so strange . We both had the same coach . "
