Not Vietnam but summer riots in the cities may be uppermost in the voters ' minds next year . Before he announced his presidential candidacy , Governor Romney warned a meeting of Republican lead ? ers : " Most Negroes are waiting to see if we mean what we say in America , or whether they have got to have a war of national libera ? tion here . " Martin Luther King is not waiting . Last week , he unveiled his 1968 campaign . Dr. King proposes to hit the nation 's capital . He says the federal government " has the power to act , the resources to tap , and the duty to respond " to the demands of . the Negroes , but that " this government lacks the will to make reforms which are demanded by a rising chorus across the nation . " Dr. King 's evidence that re ? forms have popular backing is the recent Harris poll which showed that 57 percent of Americans favor a federal program to replace the urban ghettos , a job program for ghetto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slums . Vice President Humphrey thinks so too . " On balance , " he says , " I think this country is in a mood to move forward toward solving the fundamental problems that led to last summer 's riots . " However , when the Vice President called for art ambitious plan to wipe out the nation 's slums , he got no affirmative response from President Johnson . The President 's Commission on Civil Disorders is expected to re ? port that per-pupil spending for white suburban schools is double the amount spent on inner-city schools attended predominantly by Ne ? groes . The report probably will call for police review boards com ? posed of civilians , and also for a " dialogue " between city establish ? ments and ghetto dwellers . But if , as is rumored , the report also calls for spending up to $3 billion next year , to provide new jobs for ghetto people to help prevent recurrent riots , will Mr. Johnson pay heed ? The Administration turned thumbs down on just such a jobs pro ? gram when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why Dr. King says the government never moves to correct a problem in ? volving race until it is confronted " directly and dramatically , " and why he believes that what 's needed in 1968 is another Selma or Bir ? mingham . He plans a march on Washington by poor Negroes as " a kind of last resort for nonviolence ; a search for an alternative to riots . " That strategy may strike a lot of people as standing logic on its head . But Martin Luther King 's argument is that the country is full of " angry and bitter people , " who will respond to nonviolence only if it is " militant " and really doing something . He regards his proposed confrontation with the government in Washington next April as " a last desperate attempt by Negroes to avoid the worst chaos , hatred and vio ? lence that any nation has ever encountered . " He plans to organize thousands of demonstrators who will seek to create a " massive dislocation " of the nation 's capi ? tal until America responds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will include sit-downs to block entrances of federal buildings , including the Capitol and maybe the White House . He is prepared for the kind of retaliation that occurred in 1932 , when 15,000 troops led by the late General Douglas MacArthur drove an army of war veterans off federal property . King says , " I imagine the army may try to run us out . " King is n't ignoring Vietnam . In his judgment the United States is fighting two wars , one in Vietnam and the other against poverty and injustice at home , and is " losing both . " He is inviting the peace movement to take part in his march on Washington , on the grounds that poverty at home will not be successfully fought until the government withdraws from the war in Asia . That view is widely shared . In Los Angeles the other day , Ray Holland , director of recruiting for the Peace Corps , revealed that applications for the Corps have declined 3o percent over the past year , because of " an increasing reluctance on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which they see waging a war they can not support . " Congress is at least as much to blame as the White House for the war on poverty bogging down . The con ? ferees of House and Senate agreed last week on a two-year extension of the anti-poverty program , and the final version of the legislation is an improvement on what the House demanded . Several damaging amendments were knocked out or modified in confer ? ence . The proposed ban on political activity by poverty workers will apply only to their on-the-job hours . People who are helped by the poverty program will be permitted to take part in demonstrations after all . The conferees graciously agreed that $25 million should be used this year to feed the hungry in the South ? a pro ? posal which the House had originally rejected . How ? ever , when the Office of Economic Opportunity legis ? lation reaches the appropriations stage , it is unlikely to get more than the $1.6 billion that was authorized in the initial House version of the bill for this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poverty program sound a bit hypocritical in the light of their party 's performance this session . Repub ? lican senators charge the Administration with selling out the poor to the politicians . But again and again , the Administration has suffered defeats at the hands of the Republicans and the Southern Democrats over welfare programs . The Republicans boast that they have succeeded in cutting appropriations in the 1968 budget by about $6 billion . Most of this saving will be at the expense of the poor . Yet the Republicans take credit for a $5-billion missile defense system , which they boast they bullied the Administration into start ? ing . They were also responsible for bills making it a federal crime to cross state lines to incite a riot , and to desecrate the flag . Neither passed the Senate . They were a waste of the time of Congress , because there is ample provision in existing legislation for dealing with such actions . There is need for constructive legislation to avert riots in cities by removing their causes . But here the Republicans , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The plight of Negroes in American society is such that very special efforts have to be made to provide them with jobs , to improve their housing conditions , and to put them in better schools . The Harris poll not ? withstanding , a great many whites still ask : " What do the Negroes want ? Why do n't they work ? Why ca n't they move out of their slums on their own ? " The United States Commission on Civil Rights dealt with those questions in the devastating report it recently issued , which should be compulsory reading for all congressmen . In preparing its report , the commission interviewed thousands of ghetto dwellers . All of them without exception felt that they were trapped , caged and in darkness . A witness in San Francisco had this to say about Ne ? gro youths . " When they have to get out on the street at 14 or 15 , they consider themselves to be a man , and are going to take on some responsibility because he is the only man in the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , and he sees his mother and brothers and sisters going hungry , half-starving and trying to get the rent in . It is a bare house , like it is a cold feeling even to be there , and you have to go out on the street and become the subject of the same thing out there . There has to be a breaking point . " In Bos ? ton , another witness said : " My grandmother said things would get better , and my mother said they 're going to get better . But I do n't see any change . The cops keep pushing us , telling us to move on . We are in perpetual motion . " A woman in Gary , Indiana , said she felt she was caught in a treadmill : " People strug ? gling , people wanting , people needing , and nobody to give anyone help . " The Massachusetts State Advisory Committee re ? ported that a recurring theme is the powerlessness of the Negro community . " Whether the people were dis ? cussing housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or municipal services , they inevit ? ably made the point that no one listened to them , no one consults them , no one considers their needs . " A Harlem woman said : " The rats got in bed with me and my sister is still living in the same building and the rats are jumping up and down . " In Cleveland , rats cause $4 million worth of damage each year . This is apart from the ravages of rat-bite fever and other dis ? eases rats give humans . The public housing sectors of ghettos are isolated from many kinds of services : there are no medical facilities , no shopping centers , no drug ? stores ; transportation is bad to nonexistent . In Cleve ? land , the greatest health problems are concentrated in the East Side Negro areas , but the Commission on Civil Rights was told that the only public hospital was located on the West Side . A Boston Negro family reported calling the police after an incident and wait ? ing 20 minutes with no response . Then someone was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get out here quick , a Negro is beating up a white man . " The police were there in two minutes . A tremendous number of Negroes between the ages of 42 and 65 are being displaced from their unskilled jobs by automation . Unemployment among Negro teen-agers is even more serious . The commission found it as high as 36 percent in some areas , 41 percent in others . Some of these youths probably could get car wash jobs , but a Cleveland minister says : " They want a job that will buy their way into the American way of life . " Another witness commented that , " they want in on the American dream , that they see on their broken-down TV screens . . . . " Negro mothers resent the idea that if they are on welfare they have it easy . One comments , " Let anyone who says so try feeding five children on $167 a month . " Negroes expected nothing from the commission's. hearings . As one put it , " Like it 's nice of you ladies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't have the power to do anything . You spend more money on statistics than on solving the problem . " The commission itself concludes that " the problems of race and poverty which we face today can not be resolved unless the solutions are made the nation 's first prior ? ity . " That is the core of Dr. King 's crusade . The Chitling Test Those schooled in psychometrics have known for some time that traditional tests of intelligence are dis ? criminatory . White , urban , verbal , middle-class people score as relatively more intelligent . The tests do not measure special aptitudes and nonverbal skills of rural , ghetto , lower-class types ? people who do n't know and do n't need to know the difference between ' " exoteric " and " esoteric . " There have been various , but not very successful , attempts to develop a test of innate abilities that does n't penalize poor Negroes and farm boys . There is a test , however , which does not purport to be fair , but which is intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adrian Dove , a social worker in Watts , it is called the Dove Counterbalance Intelligence Test . It is currently making the rounds among VISTA volunteers and other white young people who work in the ghetto and who want to know their " ghetto IQ " and whether they are " culturally deprived . " The test consists of 3o multiple choice questions of which the following are samples : P ' " Which word is out of place here ? ( a ) Splib ( b ) Blood ( c ) Grey ( d ) Spook ( e ) Black . 4 A " Handkerchief head " is ( a ) a cool cat ( b ) a porter ( c ) an " Uncle Tom " ( d ) a hoddi ( e ) a " preacher .

( a ) 15 minutes ( b ) 2 hours ( c ) 24 hours ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) 1 hour . 4 Hattie Mae Johnson is on the county . She has four children and her husband is now in jail for nonsup ? port , as he was unemployed and was not able to give her any money . Her welfare check is now $286 per month . Last night she went out with'the biggest player in town . If she got pregnant , then nine months from now , how much more will her welfare check be ? ( a ) $8o ( b ) $2 less ( c ) $35 ( d ) $150 ( e ) $loo. 4 " Hully Gully " came from ( a ) " East Oakland " ( b ) Fillmore ( c ) Watts ( d ) Harlem ( e ) Motor City . The answer is ( c ) in each case . Political Party Games Arnold Silver and John Weston , two University of Massachusetts English professors , have turned a couple of political slurs into a commercial venture ? a game called Credibility Gap . It is based on the common assumption that the government tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to penetrate the artful ambiguities , brittle analogies , buttressing half-truths , indignant evasions , veiled contradictions , and slippery innuendoe , and uncover the truth .
