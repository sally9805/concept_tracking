But now he was graciousness itself , saying very respectfully : " Could I have a word with you , me boy ? Poor Adolphe 's me friend as well as me partner , and I think we should have a talk . " " Certainly , " I said , unlocking . " Conte in . " I hung his cape and hat in the armoire , and seated him ; at once he began thanking me " for all you 've done  --  not only for Adolphe , but the little one , too , Mrs. Fournet . She told me all about it . " " Then she got to the ball ? " I asked . " Aye  --  we were late but made a sensational entrance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cardinal at his golden jubilee mass .

Me boy , it showed mirages , with minarets , date palms , and Moorish dancing girls nekkid as when they were born . Bagdad was not accidentally named . " " Just exactly where is it ? " " Mexican side , mouth of the Rio Grande . " " Must be quite a place .

" " Aye . " He seemed quite fond of bragging , and as I measured him up , it came to me that the last thing I should be , if I meant to lull his suspicions , was a decent , honest man . So I encouraged him to run on , hanging on his tales , of the fortunes made in Mexico , racked up in just a few months , and the private armies that guarded them . He mentioned one Paddy Milmo , " me partner , who abused me confidence shamefully  --  though I came off with at least me share , a hundred thousand in gold , in spite of his damned soldados , looking for me all night , to clap me in the picota for the chinch bugs to eat out me neck .

They were ruined unless something was done , " and so , " I said , " as soon as the papers were drawn and the money put in escrow , I told them , Gentlemen , gauge . The agreement says seven feet , and I think you 'll find you have it . ' So , with the witnesses , they all piled into rowboats , with a red rag tied at seven feet on a bamboo fishing pole . And wherever they put down the pole the red rag went under , so they had no choice but to pay . Because what they did n't know was that while they were up at the bank signing papers with me , Sandy Gregg ,  |p32my  tugboat skipper , was turning his screw at the wharf .

Aye , you mentioned escrow ? " " That 's right . I like my money guaranteed . " He had a small , gray eye , kind of rheumy , and it looked me over now , very close . In a moment , he said : " If it 's your fee you 're talking about , for acting as counsel to Adolphe , there 'll be no trouble about it , if I accept your ideas . Could I hear them , if you have any ? " It seemed to me that , starting out to be hostile , he had now made a switch and would fall into my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to bring up the thing , going by what she 'd told me , that had to be the nub of his crooked scheme . I said : " Well , Mr. Burke , I do n't know what you 'll accept , but for my part , having read that informer 's note , having talked with Mr. Landry , and having had some experience with such things , I would say he 's innocent , and does n't have a leg to stand on . I mean he may not have done it , but how does he go about proving it ? So the only idea I have is : Plead , and get the thing over with . " The rheum in his eye took on a glitter . " Do you mean it , lad ? " he asked , very excited . " Are you serious in what you say ? " " Why string it out , Mr. Burke ? "  | " I 've been thinking the same thing meself ! " " They may confiscate  --  but they would anyway . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " That 's the main thing , is n't it ? " " And another thing , me boy  --  what does he have to lose ? The store in Alexandria , which they 'll take when the Army arrives there . But these invaded towns have a way of being burned as the invaders leave  --  so what would he have , assuming he made a defense ? A pile of ashes . ' T is better to get it over with , so he 's out ! And another thing : He still will have his cotton , through his partnership with me . But ' twill be worth nothing at all unless we 're on the spot to pick up our seizure receipt , the one the Army gives when the stuff is taken in . But how can he be there , me boy , and also be here awaiting trial ? Perhaps I could swing it alone  --  after all , everything 's in my name . But ' t would be a blight on the whole litigation to have a partner sitting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he loses the store ? What do they signify , a few bricks in Alexandria ? " It was all loyal and warm and moving , except there was n't a word about the fix Mr. Landry would be in , not being able to sue , to claim his share of the partnership . So I said nothing about it , and went on : " All right , if we 're agreed on the plan , the next question is : Which of us sells him on it ? You ? Or , as I 'd assume you 'd prefer , me ? " " If you would , me boy , ' t would help . " " Well . I should do something to earn my pay . " " And , in case he should resent it  --  ? " " Better you stand out from under . " " Aye ! For the sake of me friendship with 'm . " We fixed it up that he should talk with the Judge Advocatein charge of the case while I was seeing the prisoner ,  |p34and  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hotel . He took out his carte de visite and wrote his room number , 346 . My heart gave a little flipflop ; my room number down there was 301 , which meant on the same floor . He said : " Come right up , without asking at the desk  --  the less they know of me business , the better they 'll sleep o ' nights . But , me boy , please do n't be all day . I 'm seeing the little one tonight , and any good news I can give her , something to indicate her father may soon be free , will cheer her up no end . Will you bear that in mind ? " " I 'll report by lunchtime , at latest . " " I 'll be waiting , me boy . " " And I 'll do my best to convince him . " " I 'm sure oft . And now , the question iv payment . " He took out a wallet as thick as a book , slipped a hundred-dollarbill from inside , handed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her one hundred cash in hand , with one hundred fifty more guaranteed . Then would a small escrow downstairs , in care of the hotel desk , take care of the balance you want ? If not , say what you want , and I 'll try to accommodate to it . " Now if plotting with him was called for , I would do it as long as I had to , but I gagged at taking his money . I stood snapping the bill in my fingers , and then not snapping it , for fear it would come apart , as it had a small tear in one end , a triangular jag half an inch deep . I said : " Mr. Burke , escrow 's according 's according  --  you ask it if you need it . With you , I figure I do n't  --  so let 's defer payment until I 've done what you want . And I 'd rather you took this back . " " But me boy , you 're welcome to keep it . " " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you change your mind "  | " I 'll let you know . " And I handed the bill back , not dreaming it would become the bomb that would free Mr. Landry , and after that , almost blow me sky-high . Plenty of cabs for charter today , so I took one by the hour , and reported first to Lavadeau 's , where all the pirates , kings , queens , and harem girls were hanging on hooks , with her , Lavadeau , Veronique Michaud , and two or three others wrapping tissue paper on them , with mothballs sprinkled on . She took me back to a fitting room , a tiny screened-off place with a table in it and a chair , which she gave me , standing close so I could whisper . I told her what I 'd done , explaining : " I 'm pretending to go along , so he thinks he 'll get what he wants , a plea that 'll ring the curtain down quick . Your father , no doubt , will squawk like a stuck pig , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could ruin us . He must think he has things going his way . " She listened , pulling my head to her , and got the point , but warned me : " Willie , do n't be too long , do n't take too much time . I 'm going out with him again tonight , to pump him , but from what he said last night , another note 's going in , perhaps has been already sent . And the more he spills in these notes , the worse it 's going to be . " I asked if she 'd made up the list of the downtown stationery stores . She said she had and got it out of her purse . It was in her strange , French handwriting , with crossbars on the 7 's , accent marks , and all kind of small touches I was n't familiar with . Also , it smelled like Russian Leather . I kissed it , then buried my nose in her ruffle . She pushed her two big bulges to my cheeks , and for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was holy again , and close.  |p36But  her father was a man of ice when I lined things out for him . By then they 'd given him a brazier , and he stood over it warming his hands as I brought him down to date , and suggested he " consider a plea . " " I will not plead , " he kept saying over and over . " I will not , not , NOT plead  --  and I 'm astonished , Mr. Cresap , you would urge such a thing on me . Apart from general considerations , it involves a point of honor , the admission of an act I did n't commit , and therefore am not guilty of . I will not plead . " " Nobody 's asking you to . " " I  --  I beg your pardon , sir ? " " I suggested that you consider it . " " That I consider it ? . . . And then what ? " " Well , you 've got nothing else to do , at least that I can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you consider some more ? " " ... Consider ? And then consider ? " " And  --  consider . " He looked at me quite a while , took some turns around the brazier , then fetched up facing me . " Mr. Cresap , " he said , " you may consider me as considering . " " That 's all I want to know . " So far , except for some stalling around , getting ready to start , I was strictly nowhere , but then , unexpectedly , I went ten leaps down the road . I went up to the Judge Advocate 's office and was referred by the sergeant to a major named Jenkins . He was a tall , thin , pale man , with a black , spade-cut beard , who kept me standing beside his table and looked at papers as we talked . I led off , as soon as I 'd given my name and reported myself as counsel , by askingwhat my client was charged with . " No charge as yet , "  |p37he  said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you 'd know by now , if you 're serving as his counsel ? ' " What charge if I get him to plead ? " " Parole violation . " " He has n't been given parole that I know of . " " All these people are technically under parole  --  if they do n't like it that way , they can let us know and we 'll fix it by putting them in the stockade . " " What 's the penalty for parole violation ? " " Confiscation , of course . In return for a declaration of assets , we recommend to the court suspension of penal servitude . " " Is n't that pretty stiff ? " " Perhaps you 'd prefer I sent his papers to the U.S. Attorney , who can ask indictment for treason ? " " Treason , Major ? Are you serious ? " " Shipping shoes to the enemy 's not treason ? " " No shoes were shipped to the enemy ! " He went into a perfect rage , saying the fact the shoes were shipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winding up : " If you think it 's stiff that a man who would do such a thing be let off with parole violation , then all I can say is you take a damned light view of this war . " " I was wounded in this war . " " Oh my ! And that entitles you to what ? " " A seat , I would think . " He started a loud uproar , having orderlies bring me a chair , and then when I would n't take it got furious all over again . By then , I was furious at myself for doing so badly , but made myself shut up and stood there saying nothing . He said : " Cresap , if I may say so , you could learn from your client 's partner , who was in a short while ago , and success/fully made an appeal for the reduction of this charge to parole violation , the absolute minimum possible . He did it through courtesy . " " We could all use a little of that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have turned out I do n't know , but about that time the sergeant tiptoed over , bent down and whispered , and the major jumped up and brushed past me to a man in the hall who had a colored porter behind him , carrying what looked like a case of booze . The major blustered loudly that " those goods were to go to my billet . " The man was nice as pie , saying the billet was where he was headed , but first  --  and he rubbed his fingers in the way that means money . The major took out a note , which the man held in his teeth while fishing into a weasel to make change . I was edging to the door and could see it was a hundreddollarnote , but paid no special attention until the man stuffed it into the weasel after handing the change to the major . And that 's when I suddenly saw what " courtesy " meant . One end of the note was torn , a triangular jab about half an inch deep . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bellowing my thanks to the major for all his kindness to me . On the street I got the man 's name , Lucan , and his business address on Baronne Street  --  after buying the bill off him for five twenties and a one . I told him : " I like a big bill in my poke ; it impresses my friends . " He was pleased as punch with his profit , and as I rolled down to the City Hotel , I knew I had something.  |p39I  WAS SO EXCITED I told myself to forget the ransack job ; I had enough already , what with this hundred-dollar bill that Jenkins must have got from Burke and the stationery as soon as I traced it , to put up quite a fight . However , I picked up my keys on the way , and when I went up to 30 ! , which was just a regular hotel room with bureau , chair , table , bed , gaslight , and bath , tried both in the door . They both worked perfectly , the skeleton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 346 , around an angle in the hall , and knocked . Letting me in was a human gorilla , a swarthy thing with hair growing out of its nostrils , thick brows , and a foreheadone inch high . It was squat and bandy-legged , and on the back of one hand was an anchor . It had on a clawhammersuit , with patent paper collar of the kind European servants wear , and called in kind of a croak : " M'sieu Boorke ! " Burke came out and shook hands , and called itp40Pierre . " Me gippo , " he said to me , and then : " Pierre , c'est M'sieu Craysap . " The thing grunted , bowed kind of stiff , and flicked off one ear the salute that sailors give . Then he went out through a side door of the room . " I did n't know you spoke French , " I said . " ' T is one of me bonds with Adolphe , " he told me . " Aye , I lived in Paris three years after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He shot me a glance as though to see if Nicaragua meant anything to me , and then when I did n't react , went on : " I joined the filibuster , and helped organize Accessory Transit  --  for Walker , early on . He abused me confidence no end , but I managed to sell out to one of Vanderbilt 's men , at a bit iv a profit . That 's when I went to Paris , to take me bearings a bit . " " Walker was something , was n't he ? " " A homunculus , but a genius of his kind . " " He must have been  --  to steal a whole country , with just a handful of crazy boys he picked up in San Francisco , and then after he invaded , to start a railroad and make it pay . As Accessory Transit certainly would have , if Vanderbilthad n't got in it , starting a feud . " " Aye . Aye . And Aye . " Pierre came back , in reefer and sailor hat with a red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navy , said something about dejeuner , and went out . Burke said : " The perfect retainer . I picked 'm up in Matamoros , when his ship sailed without 'm . He washes me clothes , minds the door , acts as me bodyguard , and in all ways is me factotum  --  or gippo , as we say in Limerick . He 'd do anything , anything I tell 'm , and it does n't displease me he speaks not a word of English . One of us is always here , but you 'll have to write your messages . "  |p41He  waved at a desk , a big walnut thing with green baize top , drawers at both sides , and paper , inks , and pens in the middle , then said : " But sit down , me boy , and let 's hear your news . " I sat , in a room like mine at the St. Charles , except that he 'd made it his home , a little . It had the usual sofa , chairs , and footstools , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big table with piles of newspapers on it  --  the New Orleans Times , and others in Spanish and French . The place smelled of tobacco , and he opened a drawer in the desk to take out a green pasteboard box of cigarillos , as he called them , and offered them . I said I did n't smoke , but noted the drawer was unlocked and full of all sorts of papers . He sat down , lit up , and blew smoke rings , tapping his cheeks . He said : " They 're Cuban , these things , and not bad  --  I ran into them in Mexico . The wrappers are sweet to the taste  --  I think they 're steeped in molasses . And the filler 's perique  --  do you mark the thick , heavy white smoke , so tempting to pop into rings ? Ah well , what 's the good word , me boy ? " " Not so good , I 'm afraid . " " But you saw Adolphe ? " " I did , and broached the subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hit the ceiling . " " But ' t was to be expected . What then ? " " I reasoned with him , and he agreed to consider it . " " He 'll open his mind to't ? " " That 's as far as I could get with him . " " But he 'll give in , I 'm sure . With one of his kind , there must be face-saving preliminaries of a grand , dignified kind . The rest is but a question of time . Did he get the brazier I arranged for 'm ? " " He practically glued himself to it . "  | " It 'll warm 'm . And remind 'm the thing can go on . " " That 's not all , Mr. Burke , I saw Major Jenkins . " He looked startled , and I said : " To get the thing lined up , what a plea is going to get us . I 'm afraid I did badly up there . They 're talking parole violation , and Major Jenkins seemed to resent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churl , that lad . " " I left in the middle of it . Actually , I ran . " " I saw 'm meself , earlier . " " So he said . He spoke most highly of you . " " He may have had reason , me boy . " He winked , then told how he 'd called on Jenkins , and how Jenkins had scaled the charge down , " from the treason case he was dreaming of " to parole violation  --  all correspondingto what Jenkins had said and to the hundreddollarbill in my pocket . I complimented him and , as I 'd made a full " report , " got up to go . So far , since I 'd given up my original idea of searching this place for evidence , it was strictly shadow-chewing , chatter meaning nothing , except to go through the motions , keeping his suspicions lulled so I could go ahead with the small , exact case that I had . But then as I stood by his desk and he stared out the window , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right on my head , so I had to reverse my intention and get in this place somehow , no matter how I did it . Beside the desk , betweenit and the window , was a wicker wastebasket , and in its bottom a scatter of scraps , torn pieces of paper of the selfsame kind the informer had used for his note , each of them showing pencil marks . They had to be a trial draft or rough draft or spoiled draft or some kind of draft of the new informer note , the one she had talked about , that she was sure would be sent . They would nail my case downp43tight , and there could be no doubt at all that I had to get them . He kept on talking and I edged to the door , out of sight of the basket , so my eyes would n't betray me . Then he got up , and we fixed it up I 'd repeat tomorrow my visit to Mr. Landry , and then report to him here , " without further talks with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He put his head out the door , asked if I 'd changed my mind about payment . I said no , I was n't in need of money , and better I put it off until I really had something to show . I went downstairs , arguing with myself that I should forget this whole idea of burgling a suite in this place to get something to please a girl . I asked myself what Landry had done for me that I had to risk my life , perhaps , doing this for him . I reminded myself of Pierre and that strange remark , " he 'd do anything , anything , I tell 'm " to do . Coupled with the word bodyguard it meant armed thug , one I dared not disregard . I told myself to wake up and get back to the original problem , which was to raise twenty-five thousand bucks . I told myself all kinds of things and seemed to be making some progress , at least to the extent that I took out her list and began checking stores . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Camp Street , just up the street from the City , I hit pay dirt . Yes , said the clerk , he remembered the Irish customer and thought it an odd kind of purchase for a person of such obvious elegance . I took his name , Bob Raney , and went up to the St. Charles , where I had some lunch in the bar . I told myself that did it : there was no need any more , now that I had the proof of who had bought the paper , to take any chance on a search . And yet all the time it gnawed at me that since rooms are done once a day , thosep44scraps would probably stay there until the maid came in next morning , and with Burke dated up for the evening , Pierre was all there was between me and what I needed more than anything . And then , all of a sudden , unexpectedly and by accident , a way suggested itself whereby I could get rid of Pierre . Two men at the next table were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her greedy , grasping habits . One of them said : " All she wants is your money , and that ends it with me . I 'll never go in her house again , from now to the end of my life . Do you hear me , fellow ? I 'm through . " It came to me I 'd heard of that house before , sitting around this bar . As soon as I 'd finished I went out and said to a hacker : " Have you heard of Marie Tremaine 's ? " " Well , Mister , I hope so . " " Take me there . "  |p45IT  WAS A HOUSE on Bienville , in the Quarter , with two bay windows ; a colored maid let me in . She started for a double door on the left of the hall . When I asked for Miss Tremaine she seemed surprised and opened the door on the right . I went into a red-plush parlor and sat down , first taking off my oilskin , which I folded beside my chair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and felt my stomach flutter when the door across the hall opened and a man came out with a girl , who whispered with him before he left . She was trim , neat , and shapely , and wore a red baize apron . What upset me was wondering what 1 would do if she came in where I was and sat in my lap , as I 'd heard was the custom . She did n't , but went back through the door she had come out of and closed it . I was just drawing a breath of relief when a woman came in , stood in front of me , and looked me over . She was small , with blonde ringlets beside her face , andp46quite pretty . I took her to be in her thirties , and she had blue eyes and strawberry-and-cream complexion , but all she had on was a robe , a white satin thing that she wore , with a gold fillet on her hair and gold slippers on her feet , but nothing underneath  --  as she carelessly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " Miss Tremaine ? Crandall 's my name "  --  giving the name I 'd signed on the register of the City Hotel last night . I went on : " My carte de visite , " and pressed a twenty-dollar bill in her hand . She blinked , but I kept right on , determined to hit the thing on the nose , no matter how nervous I was . I said : " I 've come on a matter of business , to ask some help that I need , for which I 'm willing to pay . " " Alors ? What help , please ? " She had a small voice , French accent , and cute way of talking . I asked : " Miss Tremaine , could you hire me a girl ? For a little job tonight at the City Hotel ? I kind of need a decoy , to entice someone out of his room " La-la . La-la . " " Oh , I assure you there 's nothing wrong . No  --  larceny , nothing like that . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  for something " I ran down , knowing nothing more to say , and damningmyself for not rehearsing it better , because how could anyone , especially someone like her , who looked plenty smart , possibly fall for such a tale , one so thin I could n't even finish it ? However , she seemed more curious than annoyedand kept staring at me , as though to figure me out . Then a thought seemed to hit her as a smile crossed her face , which she hid with my sawbuck . Then she shifted her stare to my hat , which seemed to interest her somehow , though why I could n't fathom . Then suddenly she said : " This is business indeed . This requires of thought . "  |p47I  mumbled something , I guess , and then she said : " I should dress me . Shall we go to my apartment , perhaps ? " I was too rattled to argue , so picked up my gear and followed her out to the hall . She led up the carpeted stairs to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the rear , which she opened for me . I went in . The room downstairs had been red plush ; this one was ivory and gold . It had a white cotton rug on the floor , a white bearskin rug over it , white chairs with gold brocade upholstery , and a white grand piano with gold beading on it . At one end was a white bed with gold canopy , faced by white armoires . She said : " Please give me your things , " and took them to an armoire , where she hung them up . Then she pulled a gold rope , and golden portieres closed after her , also cutting off the bed , on a white pole that ran across . I 'd never been in such a place , and strolled around , to memorize what it was like . I had a quick flash at the prints on the wall , French by their style , all in gold frames and some downright saucy . Then I noticed the flower vases , of bright brass as I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now coming in season . But then it occurred to me : Brass is not often used for vessels meant to hold water because moisture brings up the verdigris . Then I thought it odd that these vases showed no green cast , as all brass does , no matter how brightly shined . And then the truth hit me . I went over , picked up an empty vase , and snapped my finger on it . It clinked with the music made only by solid gold . It clinked and she popped  --  out from behind the portieres , a blue flannel dress half on , silken froufrou showing . Her eyes were like blue glass . I said : " You 've good ears , Miss Tremaine . " " Alors ? Qu'est-ce que c'est ? "  |p48I  went over , straightened her dress , put my arms around her , and gave her a little kiss , which she took on the cheek . I said : " I was n't stealing your vase  --  just testing it . " " It is of gold , non ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth . " " I have six  --  from a chateau at Reze-le-Nantes . " " I compliment you . You like gold , I imagine ? " " I love gold . " " Turn around , I 'll button you up . " She turned and I buttoned her , taking a seat and pulling her down in my lap . Then I dandled her and gave her anotherkiss . She took it this time on the mouth , and responded a little , but with an odd squint in her eye . She pulled my eyebrows , said : " Doux , as coton . " " They 're not cotton , they 're hair . " " Pourtant jolis , as you are . " " If I 'm pretty , so is a cigar-store Indian . " " Et sweet . Et nai f . " " What 's naive about me ? " To tell the truth , I 'd lost some of my fear , so I did n't feel so rattled , and was beginning to be a bit chesty  --  as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could almost act like myself . She kept on pulling my brows , and said : " Oh you give me twenty dollars  --  you take kisses as lagniappe  --  is not this nai f ? You think me madam  --  yet you remove the hat  --  is not this nai f indeed ? Do n't you know , petit , that with madam you keep the hat on ? That this is the insulte ancienne a man pays to her who be-friends ? " " ... If you 're not a madam , what are you ? " " I am joueuse , of course . " To me it sounded like Jewess , and I snapped back ,  |p49|pretty  quick : " Well , I 'm Episcopalian myself , but know only good of the Jews , especially Jewish women  --  " " Joueuse ! " she yelped . " I play ! I operate gambling house ! This is not such house as you think ! " " This ? Is a gambling house ? And you  --  ? " " Am joueuse , I have said ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I dumped her off my lap , jumped up , and dived for my things , all at one jerk . I said : " I 'm sorry  --  I apologize  --  I 've been making a sap of myself and I-don't-know-what out of you , and I 'm on my way , quick . " But she was right beside me , her hand on the armoire door , so I could n't open it . She said : " Have I acted desagreable7nent ? Have I expressed anger , perhaps ? Have I desired that you go ? " She yanked me away from the armoire , pushed me back into the chair , and camped in my lap again . She said : " Is joueuse , for example , contaminee ? Might she not wish to help ? Might she not have girls , aussi ? Who deal stud , vingt-et-un , et faro ? Can not this matter be discussed ? " " Miss Tremaine , my ears are too hot for talk . " " They are red , very droll , vials oui @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , you hear of my place  --  " " In a goddam bar is where . " " And you make some small mistake . " " Can I hide my face just a minute ? " She took a handkerchief from her sleeve , held it in front of my eyes , then wiped my nose and said : " Now ! Enough ! Even the girl may be possible , if I satisfy me she shall not be endangered , surtout with the law . This is of great importance , so please let us talk . You care for champagne , M'sieu Crandall ? " " If you do , I do . "  |p50By  the door was a white china knob which she yanked , and a bell tinkled below . When the maid came , she ordered champagne in French . Having had a few seconds to think , I determined to spill what I was up to , at least enough to convince her I was n't a thief . I gave no names , but spoke of a friend about to be railroaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City Hotel . " I told of seeing the scraps , and showed her my skeleton key . I wound up : " I know he 's going out tonight , but the trouble is his valet , who 'll be on deck as a guard . If he can be lured out , I can slip in there quick , get those scraps , put other scraps in their place , and be out in five minutes  --  even the valet wo n't know I was there . " " Now I am convinced . " " But the girl should speak French  --  " " She will . All my girls do . " The maid came , carrying the wine in a bucket of ice , followed by a child carrying a tray with two glasses and a silver dish with a slip of paper on it . When bucket , tray , and glasses had been set on a low table , the maid picked up the dish and offered me the slip . " Non ! " screeched Miss Tremaine , and rattled off some French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took the slip . It was a billhead that said : " Champagne . . . $8 . " I fished up a ten-dollar bill , but Miss Tremaine snatched it from me and tucked it in my pocket . Then she tore up the billhead , blasted maid and child from the room with a volley of French , and stood there , her face twisting in fury . She turned and twirled the bottle around in the ice . Then she twisted off the wire , worked the cork out , and let it pop . She poured a mouthful and tasted . Then she filled both glasses , handed me mine , raised hers , and said " Saute. "  | " To your very good health , Miss Tremaine . " " Et succes , M'sieu Crandall-Quichotte . " She pushed me back into my chair , but did n't sit in my lap this time . Instead , she half-knelt on the floor , her elbows on my knees , her glass held under her nose . She said : " If I screamed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual ; the girl committed no fault . And I love gold , as you said . But you , petit , make me feel as grande dame , which I love too , and which does not occur every day . " And then , sad , sipping : " La joueuse is vraiment demimondaine , half dame , half , hilt 's , madam . But , with you , I forget the one et becomethe other . So , ci apres , if you please , attempt not to pay . " " Miss Tremaine , all I see is a lady . " " Merci . But to you may I be Marie ? " " I 'd be honored to call you that . " " And how shall I call you ? " " My name is William . " But she laughed and told me : " This I can not say . " She tried to say it , and it came out a cross between veal and bouillon . She said : " I shall call you Guillaume . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass on one of my knees , dropped her head on the other , and let some time go by without talking . The ice in the bucket looked clean , and I crunched a piece in my teeth . I said : " That 's fine ice , Marie . Where 's it from , if you know ? " " Minnesota . For two years it came from Canada , by sea , and was full of small creatures . But , depuis Vicksburg , the river boats can come down , and we get the lake ice once more . "  | " Where I come from the ice is no good . " " And where is this , Guillaume ? " By then , sweet as she was , and gallant , giving help when she did n't have to , I could n't have lied any more , and in fact already hated I 'd had to give her a false name . I said : " Maryland  --  it 's tidewater , and whenever we cut ourselves ice , it 's always brackish with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask what you do ? " " Marie , I 'm an engineer . " " Of railroads , oui ? " " No , hydraulic . My specialty is piles . " " Ah , les pieux ! " Now someone who drives piles kind of gets used to a smile when he says what his business is , and more or less smiles himself . But the way she took it , you 'd have thought I sang in grand opera . She set her glass on the table , put her arms around me , and asked , very breathless : " You are associe with M'sieu Eads ? You have been sent here by him ? " " . . . Now how do you know about him ? " " Oh I know  --  I am femme d'a f f aires in New Orleans , and we of a f f aires know . He revives the de Pauget plan . " " The  --  what ? " " The plan of Adrien de Pauget , our great engineer , who wished long ago , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river , and compel it to cut its canal through the barrie 're to the Gulf . It should make of New Orleans a capitale , by opening her to big ships ! It should open also Vicksburg , Memphis , et St. Louis  --  we shall have pays cosmopolitain ! M'sieu Eads , so we hear , revives it , this de Pauget plan . You are of him , Guillaume ? " " Marie , I have to confess I do n't know him  --  my father does , but I do n't . And I never heard of de Pauget . But thep53channel is what brought me here , when Mr. Eads gets around to it . If I can get my business started , here on the spot in New Orleans , I hope to bid on the work  --  to be part of something big . " " Ah , oui . I could feel you were pate . " " Marie , I would n't deceive you  --  I 'm just a lad with a slide rule , a partner  --  kind of dumb but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing lacking . " " Money ? " " Flow did you guess it ? " " It may not be difficile ! " She kissed me once more , then jumped up and started checking over what we 'd do with the girl . I got out the City Hotel key , the one to 301 , gave it to her and said : " That room 's in my name , but she can come right up , and I 'll take another , in her name , and keep the key myself . " We agreed on Eloise Brisson as a good name for the girl , and I wrote it down on paper I found in my pocket . I said : " If she 'll come around seven , we can get the thing over quick , and she 'll have the rest of the night to herself . " Small details , we decided , could be settled with the girl . That seemed to be all , and Marie got my oilskin and hat , saying she 'd see me out . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the room I 'd been in , opened it , and beckoned . My heart dropped into my shoes ; I could see blue in there , on Union officers , and had a horrible fear one of them might know me and call me by name  --  by then I 'd met quite a few . But the faces were strange and I circulated with her , admiring the various layouts . The girl I had seen was dealingblackjack , or vingt-et-un as it 's also called , her little apron hugging her belly as it pressed against the table.  |p54Other  girls dealt other games , and one ran the dice pit , but a man ran the roulette wheel , and another sat on the high lookout 's stool , a long black cane that surely had a sword inside it in his hand . She spoke to them all and to quite a few customers , some by name . In the hall she kissed me , saying : " The girl shall be there . " Outside , I was astonished to see my cab ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the City Hotel , registered Eloise Brisson , paid for her room , and took her key . The clerk winked as he handed it over , and I saw it was for 303 , the room next to mine . I drove to Wagener 's and did what I 'd neglected to do previously : bought a tablet of the same cheap kind Burke had bought for his note . I got in the cab again , told the driver Lavadeau 's . I was all excited to tell Mignon my latest news , the scraps I 'd found in the basket , and how I meant to get them . Suddenly I thought : What do I say about Pierre ? And then I thought : What do I say about Marie ? " Never mind Lavadeau 's . The St. Charles , " I said.  |p55I  WENT UP TO MY SUITE , took a sheet of the tablet paper , printed something on it in pencil , then tore it into pieces the size of the scraps I 'd seen in the basket . I put them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaded my Moore &; Pond and strapped it on . It was a gun I 'd carried on pay day for my father 's labor , keeping it on me as I went around with my satchel of cash . Originally , wanting it to be seen , I 'd worn it in the usual belt holster . But one day as I was forming the men into line , an Italian grabbed it off me , threw me down , and made a dive for the cash . A colored blacksmith clipped him one on the jaw , so no great harm was done , but then I began wondering if a gun hangingout in the breeze was quite the idea I 'd thought it was . So I had an armpit holster made , and that 's what I put on now . A Moore &Pond; is .36-caliber and nothing much for looks , being short and stubby . But it shoots a brass shell in/stead of paper cartridges and caps , which makes it handy . I buckled the straps in place , buttoned my coat high to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hung my oilskin up and got my overcoat out . Then , at six , I went to dinner . I ate in the Orleans House , a saloon across the street from the hotel so situated that by sitting next to the window I could see down Common Street . What I had I do n't recollect , as I had my mind on the cab line down at the City Hotel . Pretty soon a victoria pulled out and came trotting up toward St. Charles . As it turned I glimpsed Burke . I strangled down the rest of my dinner , paid , and walked down to the City . The clerk spoke , and I went up to 303 . It was indentical to 301 but , with the twilight settling down , looked indescribably gloomy , or shabby , or bleak , or somethingunpleasant . I tried my skeleton key in its lock , and it worked beautifully . I took off my coat and hat and stepped out to reconnoiter . Then I remembered : If I should be surprised , I had to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I went back , put on my coat and hat again , and strolled to 346 . Inside , I could hear a man humming . I came back , hung up my things again and looked at my watch . It said 6:45 . I closed my eyes , said the Lord 's Prayer , the TwentythirdPsalm , and some Beatitudes , and counted to a hundred . When I looked again it was 6:48 . But at last it came to seven o'clock , and nothing happened next door . I cursed myself for a sucker , to think that twenty dollars would buy such a date and that such a dumb scheme would work  --  all the time watching the minute hand as it crept to 7:01 , 7:02 , 7:03 , 7:04 . At 7:05 , a key clicked in 301 's door , and on the other side of the partition someone was moving around . Then , on my door , came a scratch . I opened and a girl was there , in dark gray dress with black braid darts on the jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I invitedp57her in , so nervous my voice shook , thanked her for being so punctual , and asked her name . " Alors , perhaps you can guess , " she said , lifting the veil . " Marie ! " I exclaimed . " You did not know me , petit ? " " Well , you were wearing that veil , and " Actually , she seemed pleased at having fooled me , and pretty soon asked : " And our pigeon  --  he is in ? " " Yes . I just now checked . " " He is alone ? " " He 's singing  --  must be to himself . " " Bon . Now I prepare me . " She ducked into the next room and was gone a couple of minutes . She came back looking half-boiled , her ringlets askew , her jacket off , her camisole mussed , so she looked terribly exciting . " One shall appear seduisante , " she whispered . " There should be a law against it . " She laughed and stretched out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " One must wait for the gaz in the hall , which the night maid shall light . One should not encounter her , when she comes . " " My God , I should say not . " " If we watch , the transom will tell . " She beckoned and I sat beside her , but she moved over for me to lie , and I lay . She snuggled against me , then felt the gun . She took it out , set it on the night table . I said : " I 'm sorry , but to be safe , I thought  --  " " But oui . I too . " She opened her pocketbook , and even in the murk I could see the brass sheen of a derringer . " One takes precautions , " she said , " but your pistolet hurts ! " With the gun out of the way , she practically wrappedp58herself around me , her skirt slipping up and most of her froufrou with it , so bare skin was touching me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the tip of her tongue , then gave me a long , wet kiss . " One is not always femme serieuse , " she whispered , " or grande dame . SometimesI amuse me . " " To say nothing of me , " I whispered . " How long will you be ? In that room ? " " Why  --  no more than five minutes , I 'm sure . " " Alors ? Then we shall have the evening ? " " ... Ah  --  yes . Of course . " " We may dine ? You like Antoine 's ? " " I 've never been to Antoine 's . Sounds fine . " " Then theater ? At the Varietes are vaudevilles . " " You ca n't beat vaudevilles . " " And then ? We come here ? " " If you want to , Marie , that 's fine . " " Or chez vous , perhaps ? Where do you live , Guil-laume ? " " . . . At the St. Charles , for the time being . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a very beautiful place . " She snuggled close , then rolled over on top of me and covered my face with little kisses . " It shall be chez moi , " she whispered . Light showed through the transom and she got up , even more rumpled than before . She asked : " Have I the appearance of some poor helpless one , who has brandy , for example , a bottle in her room , and no way to extract the cork ? " " Have you the booze is the question ? " " Oh I brought . Fear not . "  | " Then the appearance is overwhelming . " She said : " When you return from the recherche , please drop your stick on the floor , to claquer , as signal to me . I shall send him for glasses , then come to you here vite , and together we disappear . " I said that would be perfect , and she put the gun back in my holster , helped me into my coat , and gave me my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave in one coup  --  I shall dress me as we go down . " She stood , soft , sloppy , and mussed , then kissed me quick and went . While I watched , holding the door on a crack , she drifted down the hall and flitted around the angle . I heard a knock , then voices  --  hers and a man 's , talking French . Then here she came back with Pierre , walking unsteadily , holding onto his arm . He was giggling , and carried a corkscrew in one hand . They went in 301 , and when the door closed I tiptoedout . I floated down the hall , turned the angle , stopped at 346 , and got out my skeleton key . But when I put it in the hole and twisted , nothing happened . I twisted two or three times , and still the thing stuck . Then in kind of a panic , I twisted both ways , back and forth . On forth the thing turned . Then I realized the door was open  --  Pierre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Marie . I went in , found everything as it had been , except that a gaslight was on over the desk . The basket , when I picked it up , had all kinds of stuff in it , a newspaper , a crumpled-up cardboard box , some string , maybe papers , I do n't recollect . But in the bottom were the same old scraps I 'd come for . I took everything out and dumped them out on the rug . I sprinkled my own scraps in their place , put everything back as it had been , set the basket in its place . Then , on my knees , I gathered them up , two or three at a time , and dropped them into my envelope . How long it took I do n't know , butp60it seemed at least an hour . I pocketed the envelope , opened the desk drawer , made sure the tablet was there , as well as a package of envelopes of the kind the note had been mailed in . I stepped to the door , got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to . I tiptoed back to 303 . I listened , and laughing came through the partition  --  Marie 's laugh , and Pierre 's , everything quite gay . I poised my stick on the strip of bare boards between the rug and the wall . I was all set to let it drop , when I thought to myself : Why ? You signal her , and you know what 's going to happen , as you like her , plenty . I thought : Are you , after doing all this for one woman , going to ruin it by hopping in bed with another ? I thought : How can you be such a rat , after the help you 've been given by this brave , saucy little thing , as to leave her now in the lurch , without even telling her thanks ? I thought : Rat or not , that 's what you have to do ! I shoved the stick under one arm , opened my wallet . I got out two twenties , dropped them on the bed . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poised my stick again , and dropped it to make a clatter . Then I snatched it up , tiptoed quick to the hall , closed the door softly , and sneaked down the stairs , listening as I went . On the second floor I sensed something . I wheeled , and looking at me was another man with a stick , who had also apparently been listening . Suddenly I remembered him : Marie 's guard , the one I 'd seen on the high stool in her gambling room . I saw he remembered me , and went plunging down to the lobby and on out to the street . I tried to tell myself I need n't feel like a rat any more , that if this man had been brought to act as emergency guard that took all the danger out . I felt still more like a rat , a rat that had been caught.  |p61THAT  DID N'T GET RID OF THE FACT I had what I 'd hopedto get , and as soon as I got back to my suite I worked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scraps together . It was n't too hard a job , once I got system in it . My first gain came when I realized that pieces along the outside must have a straight edge . By studying the ones with lines and other ones without , I was able to figure out which scraps went at the top , which ones at the sides , and which ones at the bottom . When I laid them out on my escritoire blotter , I came up with kind of a frame around a blank space in the middle . Now finding edges that fitted edges was just a question of patience , and pretty soon I had all the pieces in place . Then I got out my gum arabic , the little bottle I had in my draftsman 's kit , and with that glued them in place , using hotel stationery as backing . At last I could read what they said , and it was damning so far as Burke was concerned . Because it was not only a trial draft , as I hadp62hoped it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was also a translation from proper English , such as Burke always used , into dumb lingo , the kind an illiterate writes . In other words , on odd lines was a note , decently spelled and punctuated , giving details of the shoe shipment , while on even lines , under words to correspond , was the rough , misspelled printingof a pretended ignoramus , even to the signature LoRL PATxoT  --  everything in exactly the same style as the note I 'd seen at headquarters . I was plenty excited about it , but had to figure how to use it , and went down to the lobby to think . The point was that though I could name the informer , I could n't disprove his evidence if the Army insisted on believing it meant anything , and I kept telling myself Burke was incidental ; the main thing was Mr. Landry and how to get him out . And then I suddenly saw that my tactic lay not in fine points of what proved what , but in taking the fun out of the Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a seat beside me watching the theater crowd enter was a newspaperman , John Russell Young , who wrote for a Philadelphia paper . After a moment or two he beckoned and another reporter , Olsen , who wrote for New England papers , came over . Young was just a boy , but Olsen was in his thirties , a bit seedy , with yellow paper stuffed in his pocket and a kind of hatchet face that squinted all the time . I halfway knew them both , and spoke ; I could n't help heating what they said . It seemed Young was taking a trip to field headquarters on the Teche and wanted Olsen to cover him here in return for copies of the Franklin dispatches . They fixed it up quick , then Young said : " Olsen , there 's one thing I 'm having a look at , and that 's the camp followers they have out there  --  the bevy of colored girlsp63who cook for the boys , as I hear , and press their pants , and do their laundry  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't imagine , " said Olsen . " I mean to find out , " said John Russell Young . That 's when I remembered Dan 's panic at what the press might hear . I leaned over and interrupted : " Mr. Olsen , how 'd you like it if I had a story for you ? " " I 'd like it fine , Mr. Cresap . What story ? " " About a client of mine , falsely accused . " " Not Adolphe Landry , by any chance ? " " I see you keep up with things . " " Keeping up is my business . But how is he falsely accused ? The way they tell it at headquarters , he 's practically a one-man Q.M . for Dick Taylor 's Army . " " They tell it their own way , " I said , pretty grim , " but if you 'd like to hear it my way , why do n't you have breakfast with me tomorrow , and I 'll have it all lined up . " " Fine . Around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be expecting you then . " I put in a call for 7:30 , then went up and went back to work . I wrote a letter to the Commanding General , askingdismissal of the case on the ground of plain reason , but putting in other stuff too , like the motives the Army might have in being unduly severe , and other things the press could be interested in . I made two copies , and turned in around x:3o . In the morning , shaved and brushed and slicked , I went down to find Olsen waiting , and took him to the main dining room , as the bar was n't open yet . When we 'd ordered , I handed him one copy of the letter , telling him : " Keep it , I made it especially for you . " He whistled as soon as he 'd read it , and said : " Hey , hey , hey  --  I 'll say it 's a story , Cresap . You 've practicallyp64accused this Army of inventing a false accusation in order to earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't been able to prove , as you say you 'll be able to do . You mind my asking how ? " " Well  --  I 'll reserve that for the confab . " " What confab , Cresap ? " " At headquarters , today . That 's another thing I wanted to ask you about . How 'd you like to attend ? " " Attend , Cresap ? Hell , they would n't let me . " " Who is they ' ? I 'm this man 's counsel . " " That 's right , so you are . So you are . " He eyed me sharply then and read the letter again . Then he said : " But suppose you do n't have proof ? This letter alone is a bombshell , enough to bring in the Gooch Committee . They 'll find the proof , if it 's there . And it has to be there , of course ! This whole Army 's a mess of corruption , caused by cotton  --  graft , cumsha , and slipperoo , straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this letter intimates . That 's what 'll interest Gooch . " " Who 's Gooch , if I may ask ? " " Chairman of the committee in Congress that investigatesthis kind of stuff , the conduct of the war . " " Oh yes , I 've heard of him . " " He ca n't disregard this . " I let him run on , through orange , eggs , and coffee , until he 'd folded the letter up , tucked it in his pocket , and patted it . Then I said : " Of course , I have n't submitted it yet . " " What do you mean , you have n't submitted it ? " " But that 's understood , " I said . " Not by me , " he snapped , quite annoyed . " You hand me a letter , a copy you say you made for me , and I supposedit had been sent . "  | " But I told you ; I 'm having a confab . " " Listen , Cresap , you 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the point . This letter is news , but I ca n't touch it until it 's sent  --  that 's what makes it public , that 's what puts it on the record . " " I do get the point . That 's the idea . " " Well , thanks . And thanks . " " Mr. Olsen , " I said very quietly , " I 'm Mr. Landry 's counsel , and I do n't act for you , or the news , or the record . I act for him , and only him . If submitting the letter helps him , I submit . If not , if the confab says I should n't , I do n't submit it . Now if you want to be present  --  " " You know what this sounds like to me ? " " All right , Mr. Olsen , what ? " " Like you 're using me for a cat's-paw . " " Then call it that . " " I call it what it is . " " So I 'm using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be one , just hand me the copy back , and I 'll find somebody else . " " . . . What 's the rest of it ? " " You asking as a cat's-paw ? " " As a cat's-paw , yes . What next ? " " It 's very simple . " I told him there was another person I had to invite to the confab , and that all he had to do was meet me at headquarters in an hour and let nature take its course . By the way he nodded , I knew he would be there . I walked down to the City Hotel , turned in the key of 303 , and when I got to the third floor , opened the room with my skeleton for a quick look . It was all just as I 'd left it , even to the rumpled bed , except the two twentiesp66were gone . I locked up and kept on to 346 . Pierre opened as usual , giving no sign he connected me with the goings-on of last night though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had no reason to know there 'd been any goings-on . While he was calling Burke I had a flash at the basket : it was empty . So there were n't any dangling ends , and Burke was surprised to see me . I told him : " I 've been thinking things over since I saw you yesterday , and I 'm making one last try on behalf of Mr. Landry , a direct appeal , man to man , to the Commanding General himself . " " Me boy , it does you credit . " But when he found out I 'd already written the letter , he balked and demanded to see it . I said : " Mr. Burke , naturally I 'd like your judgment , and I 'd show it to you gladly , except for one thing : If I do n't help Mr. Landry , if I actually worsen his case , you 're the one hope he 'll have to undo what I 've done . But in that case , you must be able to say you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it . And , naturally , you would n't say so if it were n't actually true . " " ... Naturally not . " " But , I 'm reading it to them first " " Reading to whom ? And why ? " " To that bunch up there  --  those officers , up at headquarters . As a way of playing it safe , to see how it goes . If I 've hit a sour note then I can tear it up , and perhaps you 'll step in . But I think you ought to be there . " What I actually thought was : He dared not not be there . He stared , while the rheum in his eyes glittered , and then said : " Me boy , I find this peculiar . " " But if you do n't want to go , Mr. Burke  --  " " I must , but . . . What does this letter say ? "  | " What can it say ? Please sir , let him out ' " He asked more questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was gaining nerve , and gave him open-faced answers . In the end he had no choice and picked up his hat and coat . Outside I called up a hack , but as we got in he told the driver : " We 're taking another passenger  --  stop at Lavadeau 's costume shop . " At Lavadeau 's , he hopped out and ducked inside , I suspected to find out what she knew about it . When he came out she was with him , her eyes big question marks . I had hopped out by that time too , and as we stood on the banquette I told her : " Mrs. Fournet , I hope you approve this thing I 'm about to attempt  --  it 'll be nice if all of us pull together . But , whether you approve or not , as counsel I must do as I think best . It 's my responsibility . " " Well , since I do n't know what you 're doing  --  " " You will , all in due time . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we were doing an act . When he 'd handed her into the cab and taken his place beside her , I took the facing seat , so her eyes could rove my face . They had a fishy look , or a good imitation thereof . At headquarters , he was for holding things up until we could get an order for the guard to fetch Mr. Landry , but that was completely forgotten when Olsen stepped out of the wire office . " We ca n't have the press in this , " Burke roared in a kind of panic . " ' T would ruin us , me boy  --  the General makes the announcements ! ' T is how the thing is done ! " She said stuff of a similar kind , taking cue as I looked at her , but I shrugged it off . " Olsen 's all right , " I said . " He 'll give us a fair report . " Then I led the way upstairs.  |p68DAN  DORSEY WAS SURPRISED at the visitation , as I hadn'tgiven him any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told him what we were there for sent the orderly out for more chairs , then went across the hall himself and came back with Major Jenkins . We had the pleasantries , includingintroductions to Mignon . Then I said to the officers : " Gentlemen , as Mr. Landry 's counsel , I 've decided to make an appeal , a man-to-man thing , to the Commanding General himself , asking the release of a citizen who 's broken no law , who 's not even charged yet , who 's done nothing whatever but help those very boys , discharged Confederate vets , this Army is trying to reconstruct . " " One moment , " said the major . " If this is an appeal for clemency , it ca n't be from nothing  --  has to be from something , the verdict of a court . But no verdict 's been rendered yet . And if he 's going to plead , as you indicatedp69he would , how can he make an appeal from his own admissionof guilt ? I find myself confused . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " On the basis of the evidence ? " " Now you 've got it , Major . " " Evidence is for a court to pass upon . " " Major , the Commanding General 's supreme , even overriding a court , certainly overriding you . Do you presumeto decide what letters he may receive ? " That calmed things down somewhat , but my eye crossed hers and , perhaps thinking she saw a cue , she cut in , pretty sharp : " Just a moment ! I want our lawyer in this ! " " Certainly , " I said . " I mean to consult him , of course . But first I want to read my letter to these gentlemen , for phraseology , so your father has the benefit  --  " " Then revise for final submission ? " asked Dan . " That 's it  --  with the lawyer 's help . " " Then all right , " she said . I glanced around , and everyone looked worried , each for a different reason , except Olsen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention . It was just about how I wanted it . I started reading the letter , and to the preliminaries like " your attention is respectfully invited , " they hardly seemed to be listening . At my first real point , " intent is the heart of this case , " the major yawned openly . But then suddenly he leaned forward , as very quietly I read : " While we do n't deny that Mr. Landry shipped the shoes , or that some of them may have reached Taylor , we do insist that no proof has been brought that Mr. Landry foresaw this result , or in any way connived at it , and we emphatically take exception to the principle that a man can be held criminally responsible for acts the enemy com/mits . We would think it passing strange , esteemed Sir , if the President of our country placed you under arrest every time a Confederate guerrilla captured a few supplies . " " Hey , hey , hey ! " said the major . " That 's getting kind of personal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mignon exploded . " Then go get him , " I told her . She did n't move , of course , and the major barked at me : " You know what 's good for you , you 'll take the Generalout . " " Who 's writing this letter ? " I asked him . " Bill ! " said Dan . " You want our help or not ? " " On phraseology , " I said . " Technicalities . " A chill crept in , and I gave it a moment to settle , knowing that after what I 'd read no one was walking out . I went on : " Once intent be fairly examined , it becomes inconceivablethat Mr. Landry would have acted disloyally . His record of cooperation with the Army of the Gulf in its policy of humane reconstruction , through his purchases of cotton from those whom reconstruction tries to reach , his resale through a partner acceptable to the Army of the Gulf , his cheerful disbursements to Army personnel to expeditecotton shipment  --  " " I 'll take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't submitted it yet . " " You 're practically alleging graft , and I warn you , once you registered as this man 's counsel , you became subject to martial law , and I 'll not hesitate to charge you . " " With what ? " I asked . " Insubordination . Give me that letter . " " Well , " I said , seeming to think things over , " it mayp71save time , at that . Olsen has his copy , and as submission takes care of him , by puffing it on the record  --  " At last he saw the trap I was working him into , and when I extended the letter to him pulled back as from a red-hot poker . He jumped up , and kept retreating as I followed him around the room , holding the letter at him . I said , very coldly , as I went : " Tell me some more about martial law  --  and I 'll tell you more about graft . " I 'd been wondering when Burke would break , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " May I answer the scut , Major ? " And then , to me : " If one dime has iver been paid , be Adolphe Landry or me , to anyone in this Army , I hope you 'll tell me when . Come on , me boy , speak up ! " " Yesterday , " I said . " Glad you asked me . " " ... Yesterday , is it ? To whom ? " " Our handsome friend here  --  the major . " After a long , bellowing pause : " ' T is a lie , Cresap ! Your own filthy fabrication ! " Then , after another bellowingpause : " How much ? " " One hundred dollars , Mr. Burke . " " Why  --  that 's ridiculous , " said the major . But there was no steam in it , and I took my time gettingout my torn bill and waving it around . To Burke I said : " You 'll observe it 's the same torn C-note you offered me yesterday morning , in my suite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laundry 's counsel  --  the same C-note I declineduntil I 'd done something to earn it . " Then suddenly I wheeled on the major and said : " And you 'll observe it 's the same C-note you paid Mr. Lucan with to deliver booze to your billet . " And to all and sundry I said : " You 'll observeit 's the same C-note I bought off Mr. Lucan for ap72hundred and one dollars , to have a big bill in my poke , to impress my friends with . ' I hope you 're all impressed . " I took my time returning the bill to my wallet , and was startled when a fist shook under my nose . As I jerked back Burke yelled : " Scut ! Liar ! ' T is no appeal you 're making , to reason or anything else ! ' T is a bold bid for scandal , and I 'll not listen to't ! " Then to her : " Lass ! Come ! Please ! We must be going ! " With that he broke for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow slipping between his legs , so he sprawled on the floor . Big as he was , I jerked him up by the collar and flung him back in his chair . " Suppose you stay , " I said . " You may be wanted to answer questions . " Orderlies gathered , the one on duty at the door and a couple from other offices . Dan dismissed them , brushed off Burke 's trousers , and poured him a glass of water . Olsen was watching me , all excited now , and she was eyeing me too , as though not to miss any cue . But I was studying the major as he sat in a state of collapse , to figure how to handle him . He presented a problem . I 'd smashed him all right , but my danger was , if I pressed my advantage too much , he 'd begin lunging back and land us all in the soup , still hotter soup than this was , as of now . I wanted to put him together again , give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would blow him back to my side more or less in one piece , instead of slamming him around loose , wholly out of control . So , as he wiped his brow with his handkerchief , I said : " Major , I 'd like to clear something up . You used the word graft , I did n't . You scaled this charge down on humanegrounds , and in that case a little champagne , in ap/preciation for your kindness , was no more than decent manners . " " The whole thing 's a lie ! " roared Burke . " " I 've admitted nothing , " growled the major . " " It could have meant nothing , " I said . " Had it . " " . . . What the hell are you getting at now ? " " Major , " I said , very quietly , " you were a dupe . Far from giving a gift in appreciation of humane conduct , this man was using you to subvert the Army 's processes against an innocent man  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What motive could he have ? " asked the major . I ticked it off for him , the beating it had on the partnershipas an asset , but he cut me off pretty quick . " Naturally , " he said , " any Reb in a godpappy case takes a chance with his partner , but how could a plea profit Burke ? " " It would wind the case up at once . " " At that , it 's better for Landry than prison . And what proof do you have that that 's what Burke was up to ? My God , we ca n't go on suspicion alone ! " " I have proof . You were made a sucker of . " " What proof ? In heaven 's name , say ! " " Burke wrote the informer notes . " " Oh come , come , come ! " " You do n't believe it , Major ? I do n't blame you . I would n't have believed it myself if I had n't been compelled . But you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latest note , the one that came in this morning naming Rod Purrin of the steamer Nebraska and telling how the shoes were shipped as Christmas gifts . " His jaw dropped , and at last he turned on Burke with a venomous look . He went out and came back with thep74same old envelope I 'd seen on Mardi Gras . He undid the tapes , took out a sheet of the same cheap paper , and laid it on the table . It showed printing that read : FEBY I0 , 1864 GENL SIR : ROD PURN NEBRASKA MATE PUT SHOES ASHUR MORGANZA IN GOONY SECS LIKE ADOLPHE LANDRY PUT THEM UP FOR HIM HE TELL NEBRASKA CAPIN WAS XMAS GIFFS FOR REB CHILLERN GENL SIR YOU DON HAF BLEE ME ASK CAPIN COOL HE TELL YOU ABAT IT BUT TALOR HE GOT SHOES MORE SOON GENLLORL PATRIOT " Fine , " I said , as everyone stepped up to read .

" Then , " I said , putting my exhibit back in my pocket , " if you 'll have the prisoner brought and sign an order for his release , I 'll tear up my letter to the General and forget the whole unfortunate incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Why not , Major ? " " Identification of the informer puts a new light on the case , that 's true . It does n't change the evidence . " " Your evidence is worthless . It proves nothing . " " That 's up to a court to decide . " " I 'm sorry , sir . It 's up to you to decide . " He looked startled , and I went on : " In the absence of habeas corpus , the Judge Advocate says if his evidence sustains the specification of a charge . I say your evidence does n't . " " I say it does . " " There 's also my evidence , Major . " " ... What do you mean , your evidence ? " " The bill I have in my wallet and this pasted-up note I just showed you are all I 'll need to prove collusion on your part , for a hundred-dollar bribe , with a skunk , to his profit , in the manufacture of a case against an innocent man . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ! " " I know you did n't . I 'll prove it just the same ! "  | " Keep it quiet , Bill ! " said Dan . " WHY SHOULD I KEEP IT QUIET ? " I bellowed . When he closed the door quick , the way he did that other time , I felt things going my way , so when he put his arms around me and started wrestling me into my chair , I let him . And I listened intently as he said : " Bill , after all , there 's such a thing as showing some judgment . Your man 's not out , he 's in . And so long as he 's in , wild talk from you ca n't help but hurt him . Now , are you going to be sensible , or are n't you ? " " I am , it 's just what I want . " " All right  --  then let 's start over . " " Fine , we can all relax . " I went over , patted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patted Dan on the cheek . I patted Olsen on the cheek . I stood in front of the major , and when I saw that he would take it , patted him on the cheek . I went over to Burke and slapped him sharply on the cheek . Then I came back to my place and sat down . " So , " I said , " in a calm and reasonable way , let 's have a look at this thing . I 'd call it a simple dilemma  --  with one horn and what we might call a handle . The handle is that the major , now that he knows the truth , can admit in a manly way that we all make mistakesand dismiss this case at once . The horn is that if he does n't dismiss the case , I have to submit this letter  --  we must n't forget that . The letter , once submitted , lets Olsen in , and also leaves him free to publish what 's been said here . And that brings in the Gooch Committee  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court of Inquiry  --  we must n't forget it . That 's as far as I 'll take it now , but we all have to realize , now that we 're being sensible , the backwash willp77be unpleasant . Mind , I do n't think the major was crooked  --  he was too self-righteous for that . To me , he 's an honest man , fair to middling dumb , who got himself sucked in , then could n't take himself out . Unfortunately , we have to go by the evidence , and my evidence  --  " " Are you threatening me ? " said the major . " Threatening you ? " I yelled . " Goddam it , am I talkingEnglish or am I talking Choctaw ? You get Mr. Landry up here , you dismiss this case right now , or you stupid sonof a bitch I 'M SENDING YOU TO PRISON ! " " Bill , stop it ! " yelled Dan . " Try stopping me ! " I yelled back . " Then all right , " whined the major . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and  --  " " I give you five minutes ! Get Mr. Landry , or  --  " " But I ca n't  --  " " GET HIM ! " barked Dan . The major knifed out into the hall , and then things began happening so fast they 're all mixed up in my memory . First she came running over , and in front of Dan , in front of Burke , in front of Olsen , and in front of the orderly , began kissing my hand . Then Mr. Landry was there , a leather valise in his hand , and she flew to his arms , kissing him and whispering to him in French . Then the major came back with papers for me to sign , and I told her take her father down and wait for me in the cab . They did , but not before Burke got in it , snarling at them in French , and she snarled back , but Mr. Landry answered quite mildly . Then Olsen left , very solemn , bowing to me and saying : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burke , me , the major , and Dan , but when Burke tried to go Danp78stepped over to block him , and told the major : " You 're holding this man , I think . You 'd better  --  if you know what 's good for you . " Then the major was taking Burke down to the detention room , the orderly going too . Then it was Dan and me . I held out my hand to thank him for everything , but he did n't seem to see it . " Bill , " he said , " I wo n't forget this day . I bring you in , I extend you courtesies out of personal regard  --  and then you play me tricks . " " . . . I had a client to think of . " " Oh , he counts more than a friend ? " " Dan , you make me feel bad . " " Oh , please do n't  --  I make allowance . " I supposed he was lining it up to take a crack at Mignon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give him the chance . He waited , and then when I said nothing went on : " You 're now in Red River cotton , which messes up everything that it touches  --  and everyone . " " Oh no , " I said , " I 'm not . " " You think you 're not but you are . "  |p79MR  . LANDRY GOT OUT OF THE CAB in my honor and bowedme in , taking a seat on the other side of her , so she was in the middle . Their flat was on Royal Street , which is St. Charles extended , on the other side of Canal , so I told the driver take them there , " but stop first at the St. Charles Hotel , which is where I get out . " It seemed to me , considering the stakes of the game , that she could have spoken up : " And me  --  I get out there too . " But what she said was : " And before you get to the hotel , you stop at Lavadeau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her father she added : " I have to go to work . " He patted her hand , then told me , speaking across her : " Mr. Cresap , I have n't thanked nearly enough for what you did  --  and I still have no faintest idea how you did it . Mignon has tried to tell me , but law is not her forte . " " Nor mine , " I said . " A reporter was the key . " " Ah ! I begin to understand . "  | " But I 'll be only too glad to explain . Why do n't you and Mrs. Fournet have dinner with me tonight , and I 'll give you the fine points ? " " Daughter ? " " Why  --  I 'd like to . Yes . " " Mr. Cresap , we 'll both be honored . " " Then I 'll expect you around seven . " We rode along , the sun out for a change , and I remarked on how nice it was to think of something besides shoes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you buy those shoes ? Did n't you know they had to make trouble ? " " Daughter , they were cheap , " he told her . " And that was the only reason ? " " At twenty-five cents a pair , a storekeeper could n't resist . They were Army rejects , mismated on size . But by taking a gross assorted , I was able to match them up , with only seven pair left over . At thirty-six dollars , plus burlap bags to ship in , plus freight , who would n't have helped out those boys ? " " Why could n't you have told the Army that ? " " They did n't ask me . " " The idea , their saying Taylor got them ! " " So happens he did , some of them . " " ... Taylor got some ? How ? " " They walked into his camp . Not all of those boys were paroled , and some of them , with shoes on , decided they wanted to fight . So they joined Taylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , that one of them might get capturedby some Union picket up there . My shoes on his feet could have hung me . " " My , I 'm glad I did n't know it ! "  | " All 's well that ends well , " I said . " Yes , " he said , sounding rather strange . " Yes . " That brought us to Lavadeau 's , and I hopped out to hand her down . She kissed him , then peeped down the back of his collar . " Your neck , " she told him , " looks like an old crow 's wing , and what causes that is dirt ! You bathe when you get home ! You hear me ? You get in the tub and bathe ! " " Daughter , I 've been confined . " " I said , you take a brush and scrub ! " " I will , but do n't make personal remarks ! " I took her across the street , raised my hat , and went back for the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Cresap , my daughter admires you extrava-gantly . " " I equally admire her . " " She 's a fine , upstanding girl . " It was all pretty flat , not at all what I 'd pictured in the way of a wild celebration of the triumph I 'd hoped for and got . Still , he was her father , and I took things as they came . When the cab stopped , I shook hands , said I looked forward to seeing him that night , and stood waving as he rolled on toward Royal . Then I crossed the street and started into the hotel . I had my hand on the door when I heard running feet ; looking , I saw her racing toward me and waving . I ran to her and caught her in my arms , as she stood on the banquette panting . She said : " I could n't have him  --  know I was coming here  --  spending the day with you  --  can we go somewhere and sit ? " I took her into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught her breath . Then I took her up to the suite , andp82when I 'd put her things away , she sank down on the sofa and said : " I ran so hard , trying to catch you before you went in , I 've got a stitch in my side . " " Want me to rub it ? " " Just hold your hand there , please . " I pretended her dress was in the way , and reached my hand up under it , expecting her to resist . But she reached her hand under too , and undid the knot of the tape , to loosen her pantalette waist so my hand could slip inside . It touched soft , warm skin and soft , warm fuzz . As I pressed the stitch , she relaxed in my other arm , and pretty soon whispered : " You were so wonderful , Willie ! Just like a bull ! Same as a rampaging bull ! " " I 'm sorry about the cussing . " " I 'm not ! Oh , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved it when you told him you stupid son of a bitch ! ' It was just thrilling to hear ! Willie , I never knew a bull could mean something to me , but now I do ! He can be the most beautiful thing there is ! The most beautiful  --  " She broke off and started to cry . " What 's the matter ? " I asked . " Nothing ! I 'm just happy , that 's all ! " For quite a while she sobbed , snuggled close , and kissed , so I inhaled her , the Russian Leather , her spit , and her tears , all in one fragrant cloud . Then I asked : " Stitch any better ? " " All gone ! You made it well ! " I started to move my hand , but she grabbed it and held it to her . I picked her up and carried her to the bedroom . The rest of the day was wild , if that 's what I wanted , but it was other things too  --  sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay close for a while and whispered , and then she started exploring  --  every part of me , including especiallymy scar . She wanted to know how I got it , something a soldier likes to forget , but I told her : my dive for the rear when the Rebs burst out of the woods , my stumble , the Reb 's lunge with his saber , the pistol-shot in my ear as one of my men got him . She listened , kissed it , then snuggledto me , patting it . Then she jumped up , slipped bare feet in her shoes , and paraded in front of the pier glass . " You think , " she said , " that it 's you I came here for  --  that 's a mistake . It 's this full-length mirror , so I can see if I 'm gettingpot-gutted . Well ? " " No , " I said , " you 're not . " " You better say so . " " I can only speak the truth . " " Ever notice how a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bunch of dabs , dewlaps , and dimples shaking up and down ? But lift her heels with shoes and then you got a nymph  --  a regular stone nymph in a garden , pouring water out of a cup . " " I never saw a girl without any clothes . " " You 've been missing something . " What I 'd been missing was so beautiful I had to look , even though I felt I should n't . And it was n't all full , round curves , but partly the way she moved . That , she said , came " from the way they beat it into me , at the convent in Grand Coteau  --  they make you walk like a lady , whether you want to or not , and wo n't have you walking like a camel . " I asked if she was Catholic , and she said no , " but the sisters will take you in , whatever you are , if you 're worth taking , and they seemed to think I was . I 'm Episcopalian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and asked where Ip84went to school . I told her St. John 's College , and that started her on her childhood in Alexandria  --  especially Hilda Schmidt , the girl who 'd lived next door to her , and how they had played , chasing each other around , " before she died of the fever , up and down the cistrens , over the roof , and down through the skylights . " It seemed that her father 's store was a double one , half of which , with the flat above it , he used himself , and half he rented to Mr. Schmidt , who had a sugar-mill supply place . Alexandria seemed to enchant her , and suddenly she asked : " Where you taking us ? " " Tonight ? You know the places . Say . " " How about Galpin 's , then ? " " Galpin 's is fine . " " It 's just a few steps from us , Willie , and after we 've finished dinner we can all three go to the flat and I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then you can see what it 's like . " " I 'd love it . " " Incidentally : I 've been working today . " " At Lavadeau 's , you mean you 're telling your father ? " " That 's it  --  I 'm all tuckered out , but will go home to dress and we 'll come to you . And , incidentally , if I 'd known what was scheduled today , at headquarters and all , I 'd have put something on . Better than what I 'm wearing . At least I have a few things left from before the war . " " I have n't complained , have I ? " " No , but I have my pride . " She stared as I talked about her dress , giving the fine points on why I loved it . Then she kicked off her shoes and came close to hear more about it . I do n't think she really believed all I said about its lines , and the way it swung sop85soft from the swell of her bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to touch her . Around five she gave me one last kiss , then got up to dress . " I hope they hang that Burke . " We 'd had quite a dinner , with cocktails , a soup called crayfish bisque , some kind of chicken with white wine , and ice cream with brandied cherries  --  and as we ate we talked . I told Mr. Landry of the way I 'd smashed up Jenkinsby making use of Olsen , and he made acute observations , comprehending at once the tactics I 'd had to employ . She filled in with details on the way I " whipped  --  that was the thing , he whipped ! " I mentioned in passing the twentyfivethousand dollars I must find , but did n't get much reaction . He named a banker he 'd take me to , but did n't really show much interest , and I saw the reason was that  --  to him as well as to her  --  a channel out to the Gulf cut by the river itself did n't mean a great deal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we looked at as soon as dinner was over . We walked a block to their flat , which was on the second floor of a house between two saloons , a toasty-warm little place from heat coming up through a register , because , she explained , " the landlord 's wife has palsy , and he must keep the fire up for her . " It had walnut-and-horsehair furnishing , a potted rubber tree , and framed mottoes on the walls . While he was lighting candles she was getting her album out , and then we sat with it in front of us on the table , she turning the pages . She had photographs , water colors , and plats , and they both seemed to take a delight in pointing everything out  --  the four wharves the town had , ramps up the riverbank , with railed platforms up top , " nice , well-built structures , "  |p86as  he put it , " not like those Teche wharfboats , all full of bugs and rats , or those Mississippi levees , with their rum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cistrens , " as they called them , just visible through the trees , " as there 's no wells in Alexandria  --  it 's all rainwater , which we run off the roofs and valve to our various cisterns , these big ones that you see , which stand on trusties so they warm in the light of the sun , and the drinking ones underground , where the water keeps fresh and cool " ; the big , new hotel , a threestorybrick affair , " one of the finest in the land , except just as it was getting finished the dayum war hit , and their furniturenever came " ; most lovingly noticed of all , the line of stores on Front Street , looking out on the river , as the bank itself had no structures on it , with of course the Landry store , near the corner down from the hotel , so it faced the lower end of Biossat 's , or the upper wharf , and its twin next door , the Schmidt van , pipe and kettle house ; Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a little town across the river . When I 'd got so I thought I knew Alexandria better than I knew Annapolis , he closed the album and mused : " What I miss most , living here in New Orleans , is the cleanliness of it  --  but of course that 's a natural thing . Alexandria 's where the Southwest begins . " " Southwest 's cleaner than other places ? " I asked . " Mr. Cresap , I have to say  --  " " Call him Bill , " she cut in . " Bill , I have to say it is . Texas may be dry . It may be dusty and poor . A Texas ranchhouse is just six skinned poles in front , holding up the porch , and no poles at all behind , as there 's nothing back there to hold up  --  but it 's big . And it 's clean . " " I 'll have to go there some time . "  | " You could do a lot worse . " Perhaps to draw me in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that was when she said what she did , about hoping they 'd hang Burke . And then he downright astonished me . " I certainly hope they do n't , " he said , almost in the tone of a prayer . " But why ? " she asked him , bewildered . " Daughter , he 's still my partner . " " You 'd still call him that ? After what he did  --  " " For sixty thousand bucks ? I certainly would . " " But Father , how can you ? How  --  " " Mignon , we 're chained ! We 're articled to one another ! Everything 's in his name , and if he does n't claim my cotton , once the Army seizes it , I lose everything ! All he need do is nothing , and that sinks me ! " " But he turned on you ! He  --  " " And what am I supposed to do ? Turn on myself ? " " You could kill him ! " His face darkened , and his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fists . He said : " I could , that 's true . He deserves it , and I imagine I 'm able . But that would get me hung , and it would not file a claim for my cotton when it gets seized . And if they do something to him , saving me the trouble  --  like hanging him , or holding him in jail so he ca n't be present up there to take receipt for the seizure , that wrecks our claim too . Yes , I 'd like nothing better than to see him swing from a gallows , but not  --  not , not , NOT  --  to the tune of sixty thousand bucks . " " Then what are you going to do ? " " I ? Nothing . It 's not up to me to do . " " You 're certainly talking funny . And that explains something else : why you acted so meek when you sawp88him up there today . The least you could have done was punch him , and all you did was say hello . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To that rat ! " " Daughter , once again : To that partner . " It was a twist I had n't thought of , and though I could see his point , walking back to the hotel I found myself upset . And I was n't much surprised to see Dan there in the lobby , apparently waiting for me , beckoning me to come over . I sat down with him on the same sofa I 'd sat on to start things off with Olsen . When I asked " What 's the good word ? " he paid no attention , but piled in at once : " Bill , be in my office tomorrow morning eleven o'clock , to answer questions about Burke , these things you 've accused him of . Have Mr. Landry with you , and also Mrs. Four-net . " " Well I guess I can make it  --  fine . " " Do n't do any guessing , Bill . You make it , or wish you had . My reason for coming tonight is to preclude a soldiers ' visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot for those two up here , under guard . This way , if it 's known you all three will be there , no order will be issued . " " I thank you , Dan . I 'm really grateful . " " You need n't thank me  --  I 'm not doing it for you . I would n't mind a bit seeing you marched through the streets . But she seemed like a very nice girl . " " Then she 'll thank you , I 'm sure . " " How 'd you like to go to hell ? " " I ignore your remark . I 'll have her there . " " See that you do . And do n't bring Olsen. "  |p89I  HAD HER THERE , with her father , and promptly at eleven o'clock we were all in the selfsame places we 'd been in the day before  --  Dan , Jenkins , Burke , Mignon , Dan 's orderly , and I. But in addition , Mr. Landry was there , as well as a lieutenant colonel named Rogers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Burke , and Pierre , Burke 's gippo , in his reefer , his sailor hat in his hand . The lieutenant colonel was senior , so everyone waited for him to begin , which he did after taking his time and shuffling papers around . He was a smallish man who looked like a lawyer , and presently he said : " All right , let 's take up first this money which William Cresap alleges to have been paid by the prisoner Burke to Major Jenkins of this staff . Mr. Cresap , do you still have the hundred-dollar bill which you say was passed ? " " I do . " I took it out and showed it.  | " You saw this bill passed ? " " No sir , I did n't . " " Then how do you know it was passed ? " " I saw it first when Burke offered it to me in payment for services and then an hour later , when Major Jenkins paid it out to a man for a case of champagne . To have it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred and one dollars . " " You 're sure it 's the same bill ? " " I am , definitely . " " By what means of identification ? " " This jag torn in one end . " " Mr. Cresap , since neither Burke nor Major Jenkins makes any admission regarding this bill , do you have any further identification ? " " No , Colonel Rogers , I have not . " " You realize any bill could have a jag ? " " No two would be jagged the same way . " " They could be ! They could be  --  could n't they ? " " Not so as to set up a reasonable doubt . " " Mr. Cresap , a jag is no identification at all . " " Nothing is  --  under a coat of whitewash . " " Whitewash , did you say ? What do you mean bythat ? " " You heard me , and you know what I mean . " My hackles were rising as I saw the drift of his questions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came over and pushed me back , trying to keep me quiet . Colonel Rogers started to roar about people who made " wild , reckless charges , without a scintilla of proof , " but I cut in to tell him : " Talk louder , Colonel  --  so maybe you 'll believe what you 're saying ! " Then she got in it , screaming atp91him furiously : " You think he did n't take it , this money Burke paid him ? Then why were n't you here yesterday , as I was , to see the look on his face when Mr. Cresap showed him that bill ? Why was it he turned white as a sheet ? What was he scared of , Colonel , if it was n't the truth catching up ? " " Daughter ! Please ! " said Mr. Landry . " Are you trying to shut me up ? " But he did shut her up , by putting his hand to her mouth and pushing her back in her chair , the way he 'd pushed me . Colonel Rogers walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At last he whispered : " Bribery charge dismissed . " " My , I 'm surprised , " I said . " That 'll be all ! " he yelled at me . If was five minutes before he calmed down , shuffled his papers some more , and started over . Then he asked for the trial draft of the informer 's note , the one pasted togetherfrom scraps , and I got it out , laying it down in front of him . He studied it , then announced : " There can be no doubt at all , in any fair person 's mind , that the last informer'snote and this trial draft are by one and the same hand . " He was pretty solemn about it , and his tone was cold , so it suddenly dawned on me that with his brother officer whitewashed , he would n't be so lenient as he had been . Or in other words , Jenkins-and-Burke was one thing , Burke alone a different kettle of fish . I caught her eye , and motioned she should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He went on : " The next question is : Whose hand ? " " His ! " said Burke , pointing at me.  | " Quiet ! . . . Mr. Cresap , you pasted up these scraps ? " " I did , yes sir . " " Where did you get them , please ? " " From Burke 's room at the City Hotel . " Then , as he questioned me , I told of seeing the scraps by accident , of signing on as William Crandall , of having the skeleton key made , of searching the room that night , and of returning to the St. Charles , where I pasted up my exhibit . At first I spilled it freely , being just as annoyed as she was at Mr. Landry 's strange behavior in shushing things up for Burke , and feeling exactly as she did that the point had already been reached where partnership had to end . But little by little , I smelled I was heading for trouble , and that the colonel probably knew I 'd had help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I began to fence , to protect Marie ; after what I 'd done to her , I felt I could n't involve her . Maybe , as a gambling-house proprietor , she did n't have much reputation , but I had made the point that to me she was a lady . Yet the questions kept boring in , and at last the colonel said : " Mr. Cresap , here 's what we 're driving at : Burke 's man , Pierre Legrand , who sits here , insists he never left that room , that you could n't have made a search , as he was there all the time to stop you . Now please search your memory well , as to whether you can prove he left the room that night . Have you a witness to it ? " " ... I have to say I have not . " " The hotel clerk has informed us that William Crandall , that day , took a room for one Eloise Brisson , and that a veiled woman checked in . Is this true ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to say , Mr. Cresap. "  | " I was seeking evidence as counsel , and as such my actions were privileged . I do n't have to say . " " You do , to sustain your charge . " " Then consider my charge withdrawn . " " Mr. Cresap , charges . are n't debts , to be canceled at one man 's caprice  --  they allege crimes , in this case fabricationof false , information , and once made they have to be gone into . Now your charge , if true , which we incline to believe , can be substantiated , we think , only by this woman , who was seen by the night maid whispering to Legrand at his door , and who may , as your decoy , have lured him out of that room . It 's essential we question her  --  but neither police , provost guard , nor city directory has any record of an Eloise Brisson . Was this a false name , Mr. Cresap ? . " " On that I have nothing to say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I make no statement of any kind . " " What 's her true name , Mr. Cresap ? " " I would n't say if I knew . " " Can you bring her incog , for interrogation ? " " Whether I can or not , I wo n't . " Mignon , by now , had become her stone nymph in a garden , or at least had turned to marble , and I dared not meet her eye as she stared unwinking at me . But who got into it now was Mr. Landry , as he interrupted to say : " Colonel , could I put in a word ? In behalf of getting this straightened out ? " And as the colonel did n't stop him , he went on : " No one who knows Mr. Cresap could doubt his word , and the same goes for whoever knows Frank Burke . But , if those scraps were found in that basket , it does n't say Frank put ' em there ! Think , sir , how many people had passkeys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a way of throwing the blame on Frank for the injury done to me ! Think how many people wish me ill  --  not to go any further with it , the ones that owe me money , right here in New Orleans ! I strongly urge on you , that all this could be true that 's been spoken of here today , and at the same time prove nothing at all ! " " You 're defending this man here ? " " Frank Burke is my friend . " " And your godpappy , no ? " " He 's my trusted partner . " Burke , who had stared in astonishment , got the point at last and put out his hand , to squeeze Mr. Landry 's arm . Then she got in it : " And another thing , Colonel Rogers , " she said , very sweetly : " Frank leads a decent life  --  he would n't bring some woman in , a honey off the streets , to help with some sneaky search . How could he ? Keeping this man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bless you , lass . " Burke put out his hand to her , and she took it , kissing it , then patting him on the cheek . The colonel watched , then turned again to me , asking : " You still refuse to name this woman ? " " I 've already told you I wo n't . " " You spoke of a whitewash just now ? ' - "  --  ... I thought I detected one .  --  " Of one of our officers here ? " " Of that officer there , Major Jenkins . " " But when it comes to someone else , like the godpappy of your client , you do n't mind a whitewash , do you ? You 're perfectly willing to withhold the information we need to proceed against him ? " " That 's not the idea , Colonel . "  | " What is the idea , then ? " That was Mignon , who jumped up , ran over , leaned close , and screamed : " Who was this woman ? WHO WASSHE ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Landry came over , took her by the arm , and led her back to her chair . The colonel , still disregarding them , said to me : " Whitewash is whitewash . " " Could depend on what 's aimed at . " " I go by what 's covered up . " He then lit into me so bitterly I knew that he knew his case had blown up . But Dan interrupted , asking permission to speak . ' When the colonel nodded , he said to me very coldly : " Bill , not one word that 's been said here  --  by you , Mr. Landry , or Mrs. Fournet  --  is true ; but we make allowance , as I told you before , for the Red River cotton , which makes people do queer things . But if you think , by suppressing information now , you 're helping Burke , Mr. Landry , and Mrs. Fournet cash their chips , you were never so wrong in your life . Because , if you cooperate , if the three of you do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles we found when we searched Burke 's place last night , that partnership agreement , we might void for some reason  --  such as fraud figuring in . That would restore Mr. Landry his titles , and might lead to a handsome profit . Now that we know the shoes were a trumped-up thing , we 'd be disposed to treat him kindly . But if the three of you keep on associating yourselves with Burke , it breaks the bank for you . It so happens I 'll be in charge of the trading passes next month when the invasion starts to roll , and , I promise you , this oily , slippery , crooked Irishman will not be on board the boat . That 'll extinguish all titles because ,  |p96do  n't forget : The godpappy has to be there , in person , to claim his seizure receipt . Without it he ca n't litigate . Do you hear what I 'm telling you , Bill ? " " I hear you , so far as that goes . " " But you still refuse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You persist in shielding Burke ? " " I 'm not shielding anyone . " " Yes he is , he 's shielding a woman ! " " Madame , hold your tongue ! " The colonel snapped it out like the crack of a whip , and she shut up for a second or two . Then to Dan she said : " You think your old headquarters boat is the only way to Alexandria ? Well , there 's others . " " That 's right , you can walk  --  or swim . " " We 'll get Frank there , do n't worry . " " Then I wish you luck . " After ordering the guard to quarters , the colonel told Burke : " You may go . " Then , except for the military , we were all clumping downstairs . In the lower hall , Mr. Landry grabbed my arm , saying : " Bill , I 'm sorry , but I could n't throw away that money . I know Frank did me a grievous wrong , but to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's all right , business is business . " " I should have talked against him , perhaps , but " " Well , I did n't ; why should you ? " " Bill , I may say you surprised me . That woman  --  " " Oh , the hell you say ! " I ripped it out , very bitter , and in fact was perfectly furious that not only she but he , after what I 'd accomplished for them , should have the gall to object to a thing alreadyp97explained by the officers themselves  --  even the colonel had caught the reason for my bringing a woman in . At my tone he cut it off , and started mumbling about my fee for acting as his counsel , " which I should have brought up sooner , but did n't . " To me , that was just a pain in the neck , and I started for the door . Then something hit me on the chin  --  warm , wet , and ticklish , and I realized she had spat from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smell of spit from her lips had been intoxicating to me , but now it made me so sick I thought I might lose my breakfast . I ducked out onto the street , and turned the corner before I got out my handkerchief and wiped the stuff off.  |p98AT  THE HOTEL I washed my face , then went down for something to eat . Back in the suite again , I sat down and tried to take stock . I was rocked to the heels , I knew , by what she 'd meant to me and by what she 'd done to me  --  unreasonably , I thought . But there was no doubt in my mind as to what I should do about her . It was clear I had to forget her , root her out of my heart completely , so no trace of her would be left . After a while I concluded the best way to do it was to get back to the original tune , the twenty-five thousand dollars and how I would get it . Remembering the talk about bankers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were n't the answer and figuring how I might meet some . Then the numbness seemed to start wearing off , but I was deluding myself  --  more afterclaps were due , and my troubles had hardly started . Around three , I guess , a knock came on the door , but I waited a second or two be/fore opening , to steel myself to be tough , in case she was there , taking back what she 'd said and wanting to make up . Who was there was Marie 's guard . He did n't wait for me to speak , but whipped out his sword , shoved his foot in the door , and called out in French , all in less than a second . Then Marie appeared , in the same little gray dress , with black darts and black shawl , she 'd worn that night in the other hotel . He backed me into the room to the space between the windows , and when my head banged the wall told me " Reach . " I did , and then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my eyes , pulling my mouth open , stuffing them in , and pushing my chin up . They were n't new bills , so they tasted indescribablyfilthy . Then she started to work me over , firing the first slap so hard my ears rang . I reached for her wrist automatically , but he jabbed the steel in my stomach , telling me : " Keep ' em up ! Keep ' em up against the wall ! " I did , and she kept on with her slapping , the licks coming so fast I sounded like a razor being stropped . The shawl slipped off and she flung it aside . The jacket came unbuttoned and she flung it aside . Her hat slipped over one eye and she flung that aside too , causing her ringlets to twist askew and hang over her face . Real , she was ten times the Jezebel she had been , pretending , to entice Pierre from his post . And at last , free of all encumbrance , she let me have it hard , pulling off one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausted , she told him : " Assez , assez , assez , " and he told me put down my hands . Then to me she said : " Wash you ! Then hear me , what I shall say ! " I started for the bath , but kept on to the bedroom , first spitting the bills out on the floor , then digging into my bag and coming up with my Moore &; Pond . I went back holding it on them , andp100he dropped the sword cane , both parts at the same time . I put my foot on the blade , then lifted its hilt to snap it , and kicked stump , point , and scabbard against the sofa . ' When I looked up she was reaching for her purse . I remembered the derringer in it and kicked over the table she 'd put it on . Then I picked it up and dropped it in my pocket . I said : " All right , now suppose you git . The two of you , march ! " She said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then you git , " I told him . " Git and keep on gitting . If I open that door and you 're there , it 's the last place you 'll be on this earth . Did you hear me ? " " I did . " " You did , what ? " " I did , sir . " " That 's better . Now  --  " But he was legging it for the stairs as I closed the door . When I turned , for the second time that day I felt a wet tickle on my chin , and from the look on her face knew blood must be running down . I took out my handkerchief , but she grabbed it and started to wipe . I knocked her down . Then I went to the bath to wash up , first rinsing out the horrible taste of the money . My face , when I looked in the glass , was so cut , bruised , and puffed that I hardly knew myself . But when I laved it with the witch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not much , but a little . When I went back to the sitting room , she was still there on the floor , a tiny heap of blonde ringlets , tousled froufrou , bare arms , and pretty , silk-stockinged legs . But one look and my insides collapsed , as the reaction set in , not only from this scene now , but the preceding ones too , inp101Dan 's office and in the headquarters hall . I 'd worked up quite a sulk , but the bottom fell out of it , and I knelt beside her , picking her up , in a clumsy , laborious way staggeringto my feet , and making it to the sofa . I sat down , snuggling her in my lap and having a look at her chin . It was beginning to swell , and of course that made me feel wonderful . I said : " I 'm sorry , Marie . " " I too am sorry , Guillaume . I excuse me . " " I had it coming , if you mean the beating you gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sooner  --  that you took so long finding me . " " I found you the same night . It was not difficile , please believe me , for me to locate some  --  " She hesitated , and I said : " Yank with a game leg ? " " ... Ingenieur with hair of gold . " " That 's a very nice way to put it . " " I came yesterday morning  --  you were not here . I came last night  --  you were not here . I came for third time today " " And I kept the appointment . " " I have said , I excuse me , please . " That seemed to mean she apologized , which was about all I could really ask . She put her feet up , then stretched her legs out full length , so practically everything showed . Then : " Guillaume , always it is the same , you are gentil , I gamine . Today , I confess it , I tell the truth : I tried to demean you , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to beat . To see the elegance brisee . Et apres ? You compel Emil to say Sir . There , in one word , was my grand seigneur . And what have we here , aussi ? " " All right , what ? " " La creature , moi , regardez. "  | " Oh I would n't quite say that . " " Ah oui , I am nothing . " " Stop being silly with this kind of talk . " " Petit , I am demi-mondaine ! " Then suddenly in a torrent of tears she was kissing my face , every welt and bruise that she 'd put there , winding up with my mouth , I kissing back and meaning it . She kept saying : " You make me feel as grande dame  --  as what I wanted to feel and could not . " I kept whispering she was a grande dame , and should stop talking this way . She listened , and soon the weeping began to slack off , so it was just comfortable little sobs as she relaxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not objecting much when I began taking them off . Pretty soon she was in pantalettes , stockings , pink garters , shoes , and not much else , except for a thin gauzy sling for her attachments above . I patted her , soothed her , and she purred almost like a kitten . Then , after a long time , she asked : " Guillaume , why did you not say ? You did what you did for Mignon ? " " ... Mignon ? You know her ? " " Mignon Fournet ? But of course ! " " I had n't realized . " " Not well , but  --  agreeably . Fournet I knew  --  too well . When he has lost everything in the war , he comes to me  --  and loses it encore . To him I have returned  --  all , all that he loses to me , at roulette , at vingt-et-un . I owe her nothing , and  --  " " She means nothing to you ? " " Ah oui , rien , rien ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Then why did she quarrel with you today ? " " So you heard about that too ? " " It is my business , as joueuse , to hear all , but I understandnot why her father should reconcile with Burke . " The ins and outs of that had to be explained , and she listened closely . " The answer was tin , " I said . " He made that plain last night  --  no matter what Burke had done to him , he could n't afford to pass up sixty thousand dollars . Well , maybe she quarreled with me so Burke would n't quarrel with her and spoil her father 's game . " " To me , this is not really clear . " " To me either  --  but she means nothing to me . " " Why did you leave me , then ? " " If I had n't , you know what would have happened ? " " We said dinner , non ? At Antoine 's ? And  --  " " Marie , I 'd have spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alors ? Alors ? " " I had work to do that night . " I told of the paste-up job , the letter , the two copies , the arrangements I made with Olsen . I said : " It had to be done that night , everything  --  or I could n't take Burke by surprise . " " But this you could have explained . " " I was afraid . " " Of me , Guillaume ? " " Of myself . " " Why did you not explain me ? By  --  letter ? " " To be honest , I was ashamed to . " " Did you go to her that night ? " " I swear to you , Marie , I did not . " She thought that over , lying there in my arms , with the look in her eye of a stud-poker player who knows how top104read your mind , then asked : " Have you spoken to her of les pieux ? " " Yes  --  last night , after dinner , to her and her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to say , if it had been a Red River job , I think it might have been different  --  theirreaction , I mean . " " Fournet made this complaint . " She went into some detail about this boy from the Teche who had started a law practice here , married Mignon , and then found out that all she could get her mind on was stuff about Red River . Then suddenly : " She is folle . " " Well ? Are n't we all , more or less ? " " She makes combinations  --  which prevail not . " " I 've had a few flukes myself , Marie . " " She put Fournet in coton de la guerre . " " And  --  she put her father in , so she says . " " For Fournet it was a catastrophe . " " For Mr. Landry it may turn out better . " " He is in  --  not yet out , petit . " " At least he 's out of jail . " " Thanks to you , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more about Fournet , his moral collapse after the cotton broke him , his gambling , his enlistment , and death ; it seems to me there must have been because I wound up knowing a great deal about him , but then , very solemnly , she asked me : " Guillaume , do you love her ? " " I swear to you I do n't . " " Your demi-mondaine could love . " " I know no demi-mondaine . " And then , pretty solemn myself , I added : " If a certain grande dame could love , then an engineer could , too . "  | " She could venture twenty-five thousand bucks . " She called it hocks , very funny , and my heart gave quite a twitch . Then the full force of what she meant to say hit me , and my heart gave a real , shaking thump , which caused a lump in my throat . I said : " For that I 'd owe you some kisses . " " And  --  anything else , petit ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To demi-mondaine it means much . " " Consider yourself proposed to . " " I am Episcopalienne , as you are . " " And not Jewish , as I thought you said . " Recollection of that made her laugh , and suddenly shekissed me and jumped up . " But , kisses first , petit ! May Ilook at my chin in your bath ? " " Help yourself , it 's right in there . " She went in and a minute or two later came out without a stitch on , holding her shoes and things in one hand . Blowing a kiss at me , she went on into the bedroom . I started gathering the rest of her clothes ; for all I knew someone might come , and at least I 'd have the sitting room clear of telltale duds . And then suddenly there she was , still with no clothes on but walking like an old woman , and slumped down in a chair . " What 's the matter ? " I asked . " Marie , what in the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you lied to me . " " I did n't , I swear ! " In my heart I had n't been lying , at least to be conscious of it , as I 'd made tremendous decisions , and in the light of them what had happened the previous day , which was all I 'd really omitted , had n't seemed important . Or , if it hadp106been important once , it was n't any more . So I went right on talking , saying the same things over , and she kept sitting there , paying not the slightest attention . Then she got her things from the bedroom , came back , and put them on . Pretty soon she was all dressed , pulling her veil in place . Then , very dignified , she said : " Guillaume , I was happy to go to your bed , and thought only of the kisses I meant to give . Then her scent came as a coup . I mistake not the RussianLeather , it is as her marque de f abrique , and your bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example . I suppose I understand why you lied  --  but how can one speak of the scent ? It is too much , I must go . " " She quarreled with me over you . " " And you protected me , as I know . " " They wanted your name . I refused it . " " There spoke my chevalier . " And then , very quietly : " To him I must keep my word . You shall have the twentyfivethousand  --  " " Will you forget the goddam tin ? " " My banker shall call . And now , adieu . "  |p107SO  HE DID , the next morning , a Mr. Dumont , connected with the Louisiana Bank , but I would n't let him in and talked through a crack in the door , telling him come some other time . That was because by then my face looked like liver  --  purple , blue , black , and yellow all at the same time  --  as well as being swollen twice its size . So I was n't seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them leave it outside the door , then pulled the tray in after they 'd gone . So I put Mr. Dumont off , and was n't any too sure , I admit , I wanted to see him at all . But at night I 'd go downstairs , and without going through the lobby , slip out the back way , up Gravier to Carondelet , over to Canal , then down to Royal and on to the Landry flat . I 'd skulk around outside , trying to see Mignon , torturing myself by spying on what she was doing . I found out all right . One night , as I stood in the shadows across the street , a cab drove up , andp108out of it popped Burke . Then he handed her down , and told the cabman to wait . She was laughing gaily , and the two of them went in . How long he stayed I do n't know , whether alone with her I do n't know . I slunk back to the hotel and in by Gravier again , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was out there as usual , seeing nothing . In four or five days , call it a week after Mardi Gras , here came Marie , tapping on the door , saying she had to see me . I let her in , and she asked if Emil could " excuse him , " as " he feels very bad , and wants to be friends with you . " I said I 'd accept his apologies through her , and she called in French through the crack . " Bon , " she said . " He is gone  --  and feels better now . " She held my face to the light , and made little whistling noises . But when she sat down I asked her : " Yes ? What do you want , Marie , that you had ' to see me ? " " You might say you are glad I am here . " " I might  --  if I was sure I am . " " La-la . La-la . " Actually I was n't , as those nights had warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what I 'd assumed it was , and that all my bitter decisions were n't so final as they might have been . Still , there was no doubt in my mind that they ought to be final at any rate , so I gave her a little pat . That was n't difficult ; she looked most fetching in a little blue silk dress , red straw hat , red shoes , red gloves , and red shawl , obviously put on to please me . I said : " All right , I 'm glad . " " Guillaume , I have spent some dark nights . " " With me , it 's been just the opposite  --  the bright days are what I minded , the way they lit up my face . By night I looked better . "  |p109She  went to a wall mirror , touched her chin with one finger . It had a black-and-blue spot on it where my fist had clipped her , though a dab of rice powder hid it . She said : " I too have a face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " If I bruised that I did n't mean to . " " ... Done , you have not seen her . " " Oh ? You 've been keeping track ? " " Keeping track , Guillaume , is easy for me in my business  --  Isend Emil , he speaks with some night maid , he pays a bock , he learns what I wish to know .... She sees Burke  --  much , every night . " " It 's a free country , Marie . " " Perhaps you have not lied . " " Let 's not start that up again . I lied . " " ... Alors , alors . You lied . " " But , my reasons were not unfriendly  --  to you , I 'm talking about and if you still feel friendly to me , then --  " I went over and lifted her face to kiss it , having by that time arrived once more in my mind at the inescapable conclusion that she meant salvation to me . But she pulled away abruptly , and I backed off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry , Marie  --  I keep forgetting this face , and how unappetizingit must be . " She took off her hat , shawl , and gloves , and tossed them on the table . Then she came over , knelt on the sofa beside me , took my face in both hands , and covered it with soft , quick kisses . She said : " The face could not unappetize me ! I l-l-loave your face . " " Red-white-and-blue and all ? And yellow ? " " And green . " She kissed a spot under one eye . " Hold still ! " I said . " I want some kisses , too ! "  | " Non , non , non ! " she whispered , holding me off at arm 's length . " Your kisses , petit , must wait . They must ! It devolves ! " " Devolves ? On what ? " " Many things  --  my heart , for example . And one must know  --  if one has business partner  --  in which case les a ff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  in which case  --  " " An affair might be in order ? " " Petit , it can not be ! " " My mistake , it was just an idea . " " After these dark nights I have had  --  " " It devolves that we know where we 're at ? " " It is what brings me today , petit . " " All right , but how ? " " . . . You received some invitation to the bal ? " " Bal ? What ball ? " " That the General gives next week ? " " Oh  --  this Washington 's Birthday thing ? To commemoratethe election he 's holding that day ? Yes  --  some kind of bid came in . Apparently I got put on the list by a friend before he decided my name was mud . It 's around here some place . Why ? " " Alors . You ask me why ? " " You 'd like to go ? Is that it ? " " If you are ashamed of some demi-mondaine " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her gloves . " Will you stop talking like that ? " I reached out , grabbed her arm and yanked it , pulling her back to her place on the sofa . I said : " How can you say such a thing ? " " You hesitate , pourtant ? "  | " I certainly do  --  in the first place , I do n't dance very well , and in the second place , I do n't get the connection  --  what it proves , that 's all . " " It is not that someone may turn me away ? " " How , turn you away ? " " From the door ? " " If so , he wo n't live until dawn . " Suddenly she folded me in her arms , pressed her mouth to mine , whispered : " One little kiss you may have ! . . . For this , one little kiss I must have ! " " Is that how we go about proving it ? With pistols for two ? In  --  where 's the dueling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbid ! You might hang , and this would be too much . But I love this spirit , that might kill someone for me . " " All right , but get to the point . " " She will be there , petit . " " . . . Who ? " " Mignon . With Burke . " " I see . I see . I see . " " Already ice fills your heart , petit ? " " No  --  I see what you mean , that 's all . " " You may renege , if you wish . " " Not at all . I think we 'd better go . " " This confrontation shall tell me . " " To say nothing of me . " So we did go . It was held in the French Opera House , a big theater in the Quarter , and everyone was there , not only the Union officers and their ladies , but New Orleans society too , especially the ones cozening up to the North  --  of whom there were more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Marie rented for me at a costume place on Poydras , around the corner from Lavadeau 's : clawhammer suit , puff-bosom shirt , cape , and silk hat . But from the way she was got up , no question could arise that she would be turned away . She looked like the Duchess of El Dorado in a white ermine cloak , scarlet satin gown , cut so low she was bare halfway to her navel , gold shoes , gold purse , and gold fillet on her hair . In addition , she wore diamonds wherever you looked  --  at her neck in a pendant , on her wrists in bracelets , and on her fingers with various rings . She glittered like an igloo in the midnight sun ; I was proud of her in a way , yet I wanted to laugh . She caught my look , and instead of being angry , started to laugh too . " Alors ? " she said , as our cab pulled away from the gambling house . " Am I grande dame now ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope I am creditable . " What was causing my stomach to twitch was n't concernat her being thrown out , but who would be waiting for us once we were let in . For some time , though I searched the place with my eye , taking in flags , bunting , smilax , and the band up on the stage , I did n't see her . We got into the receiving line and I had a bad moment when we came to Dan Dorsey , who was presenting the guests . He was in dress uniform , with epaulets , braid , sword , knots , and white gloves , and when he saw Marie his face turned to stone . But he did n't hesitate , and sang out loud and clear : " Mr. William Cresap , Miss Marie Tremaine ! " The General 's lady , I imagine , had never heard of Marie ; she smiled graciously and offered her hand . Marie , after dropping a graceful , comic little continental curtsey , took it . I took it . We shookp113hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " Voile ? , I am in ! " said Marie , pleased as a child . " The honor is theirs , " I assured her . We stood around and I kept on looking . The band struck up the Grand March , and after we had sashayed around there came a long intermission while programs were filled out . All kinds of people wanted to dance with Marie , but she kept saying : " Lancers and quadrilles only  --  I care not for polkas and galops . " That touched me , as it really meant she knew I could n't dance round dances , and was willing to pretend she preferred to sit them out . So I marked them all X on her card , but accepted quite a few couples to make up sets for the square dances . And then , in the middle of it , I saw by the change in her face , from little French dancing partner to cold , calculating gambler , that Mignon had entered the room . I turned , and she was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Landry on the other side . She had on a black dress , whether left over from her palmier days or lent her by Lavadeau 's I did n't know and do n't know now . Over her shoulders was a mantilla , with a pattern of small gold spangles , and I remember a twinge of relief that her big , beautiful bulges would n't be seen by everyone . When the three of them had been received , Mr. Landry went skipping off and then reappeared in a box near the stage , where Mignon and Burke went to keep him company , though they stayed out on the floor . " Alors , " whispered Marie . " I must speak ; it devolves , let us go . " Her grip on my arm meant business , and for my part I steeled myself , feeling I might just as well get it over with . " Mignon , " called Marie brightly as she rustled over the floor , " bon jour , bon chance , salut . " " Marie , " said Mignon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very coldly , staring down at Marie 's bare shoulders , and then Burke took notice of us . " Why , " he said , " if it is n't the sneak thieves themselves  --  the girl who enticed me gippo to her bed , the sly minx  --  and the boy  --  " " Burke , " I said , " retract . " His eyes moved around in their rheum as he took in my grip on the stick , and he said : " I may have spoken in haste . " " Apologize . " " I regret me impulsive words . " " Then fine . Hereafter speak when you 're spoken to . " Marie 's hand on my arms gave a quick , grateful squeeze , and then she went on : " Mignon , I have business with you , we have an affaire  --  but first may I present my fiance , M'sieu Guillaume Cresap ? " Mignon flinched as though hit with a whip , and started to answer in French . Then she remembered and said : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were engaged . " " I did n't either , " I said , sounding silly . Now if , on that , Mignon had burst out laughing and said : " Willie , let 's be going , " my story would be over . And if Marie had slapped me and left me , it would be over , too . But neither of them did , the two of them standing there , Mignon as though turned to marble , Marie as though turned to flame . It was Marie who said : " Alors ? I excuse me , then . One may be mistaken , it seems . " " Oh , I would n't say that , " I told her . " What would you say ? Jouez , if you please ? " " ... Count me in . My chip 's on the table . " " I congratulate me . " There was quite a long pause , with nobody saying anything , especially Burke . Then Mignon said : " And now may I present my fiance , Mr. Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowed . I tried to say something and could n't . Mignon went on : " Marie , what business have you with me ? What affair can we possibly have ? " " Ah bon , you shall see . " She dug in the little gold purse and came up with pieces of paper that had been folded , then rolled . She stretched them like shavings off a board , held them up to Mignon , and said : " See ! Here I have some billets , signed by Raoul Fournet ! " " Signed by  --  whom ? " whispered Mignon . " Raoul , your husband , who died . " " Let me see those notes ! " " Certainly  --  I have returned the money Raoul lost to me , but these billets I forgot . Here are two for four hundred , one for two hundred , one for six hundred  --  four in all , for total of sixteen hundred dollars . But , did you not know about them ? " " No , I knew nothing at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " . . . File your claim is all I can tell you , Marie . The estate 's not settled yet  --  there 's quite a lot owing , beside this . " " But a gambling debt claims not . " " Then what do you want of me ? " " Nothing . I thought you might like to have . " " In return for what , Marie ? " " Alors  --  you dance in my lancers , perhaps ? " " What lancers ? " " Here . Now . Tonight . " " Takes more than two for a lancers . " " Oui  --  you , I , your fiance , my fiance , friends . "  |p116After  a long time Mignon said : " I accept . " Marie tore the notes in half and handed them over , and five minutes later we were all marching the lancers , Mignon like a ghost in the graceful way she moved , Marie more like a doll in that comic way she moved , as though spinning around on a music box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to who had bowed the head to whom . At supper , Mr. Dumont joined us , a mousy little man with gray hair  --  the first time I 'd actually-seen him , though we had talked through my door . He gave a report on the hypotheques , which I took to mean mortgages , that Marie was going to assume to raise my twenty-five thousand dollars . They involved considerable talk , not only with him but also with other men who dropped by , most of it in French , with Marie jabbering it pretty coldly . But in the middle of it , Mr. Dumont whispered to me : " You 're getting a wonderful partner , Mr. Cresap . This woman can see a dollar farther and grab it quicker than anyone I know . Count yourself lucky , sir . " When the music started again she decided she wanted to leave ; going home in the cab she told me : " M'sieu Dumont accepts you , Guillaume . He thinks you home de bien , and ingenieur verse . " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased with our evening , petit ? " " I was . Are you asking me in ? " " . . . Are we fiance ? " " Of course ! What makes you think we 're not ? " " The mot you said , to her . " " That was a joke ! You caught me by surprise ! " " On this subject one makes no joke . " " Then  --  I take it back . Are you asking me in ? "  |p117She  hesitated , snuggled close , and kissed me once or twice . Then : " I am tempted , this I confess , ah oui , so much . And yet  --  I trust you not , petit . Perhaps you still love her . " And then , as I protested that this was ridiculous , that all that was finished , over , and done with , she kissed me again and thought it over again . But once more she said : " Non ! Guillaume , we are partners in business  --  this I promise , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I hope , and at last you can make a grande dame of me . If then there shall be more  --  bon ! I shall give you children of me , jolis babies with hair of gold , as ours . But this must wait  --  until of you I am sure . " " I could make you sure tonight . " " Later , later , petit . "  |p118SO  I HAD EVERYTHING in my grasp , the capital I needed , theconstruction firm I wanted , a woman I thought the world of , and the days began sliding by . Dumont forged ahead , though the hypotheques took time : appraisals had to be made , titles searched , and easements squared of the propertiesshe was plastering . They were five houses on Rampart Street that she did n't want to sell but was willing to borrow on . And what hung things up worst was the easements  --  old grants , to places up the street , of carriage-entrance rights , something the bank did n't like . It was just a question of buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the haggle went on for some time . In between , she and I went around  --  to restaurants , to church , to the theater , and I met quite a few of her friends . What pleased her most , I think , was the way they treated her at Mrs. Beauregard 's funeral , which was held one day in the rain . It was a damnedp119impressive thing , and pathetic too because Beauregard was n't there  --  had n't even heard of the death , being off in the field commanding Reb armies in Virginia . We rode in a cab , but most of the people marched , a slow , sad procession of thousands trudging along , their heads bowed in the downpour . But at the foot of Canal Street , we stood around with the rest , while the body was carried on board the steamer to be taken upriver for burial . Many people spoke , and she whispered to me : " So you see ? Perhaps I have friends . " " Who ever thought you did n't ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same day , we went to the inauguration of a man named Hahn as governor , the one elected on Washington'sBirthday . It was indeed quite a thing , with six thousandchildren singing the " Anvil Chorus " from Il Trovatore , one hundred anvils banging , and fifty cannon shooting , all in time to the music . But in the middle of it she said : " Shall we go , petit ? I find it sottise , non ? " So we drove to Christ Church to set the date of our wedding and make the various arrangements . She insisted on Dr. Bacon , the church 's regular rector , and would have none of the other one  --  the one the Union had named , nobody knew why . We discussed several dates , and decided on March 29 , the Tuesdayafter Easter . She seemed pleased , and I took her home . By that time , though I was n't asked upstairs , she would bring me into the parlor , close the door , and forget herself a little . She brought me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man , an article named Murdock , with a blue chin , fat stomach , and New England way of talking . I was startled to learn he was bidding on the establishment , getting ready to buy her out . She quoted a hundred thousand dollarsp120without batting an eye ; he said seventy-five thousand with kind of a rasp on his voice . She said , very ugly : " Allen , allez , our  --  please do not waste of my time ! " " All right , " he said , " eighty . " " Will you please go  --  now ! " He went , growling , and she said , very sweetly : " He will be back , I think . " And then : " Does it please you , petit , that I shall be joueuse no more ? " " I like you the way you are . " " Merci , but you would prefer femme serieuse ? " " If you insist on asking , I would . " " Alors , you shall have . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being I spent hours in cabs watching Lavadeau 's , and at night , going back to the hotel , always went by way of Royal so I could see Mignon 's windows . I saw her a number of times  --  occasionallyby night coming home with Burke , more often by day going to work . Each time my heart would strangle me , the worst being when she 'd have on that dress , the little black one I loved , which was getting so bedraggled now it made me want to cry . I would go back to the hotel then , walk around , beat on the wall with my fists , and curse . I 'd tell myself cut it off , stop an insane game of self-torture , act as though I were bright . It would seem as though I would , that after a session like that I could return to my senses . And then the same night I 'd be there , out in the dark again , staringas though demented , seeing what I could see . And then one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next night and the night after it was the same , and by day I did n't see her go to Lavadeau 's . By then , it was coming on for the middle of March and all traffic hadp121disappeared from the river , the boats having been commandeeredto haul the invasion . It was the main topic of talk in the bars all over town , and in fact had already started , rumor had it , the Teche units having moved . If the dark windows meant she had moved too with her father and Burke for Alexandria , to be there for the cotton seizure , it was a blow , of course , but a kind of relief too , because it brought things to a head , affording the break I needed to put her out of my mind and get on with my life . And that , I think , is how it might have turned out if I had n't run into Lavadeau . Until then , though we 'd nodded a few times , he 'd paid no attention to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself about me . But one day on Gravier Street , as I was taking a walk , here he came carrying a box , and stopped as soon as he saw me . " Mr. Cresap , " he said , not even bothering to say hello , " I do n't know if I 'm speaking to you or not . How could you let her do that ? " " Let who do what ? " I asked him . " Mignon  --  go to Alexandria with Burke ? " " ... Then she went , with him ? " " Oh , Papa went too  --  and that ape Pierre . They all went , Thursday morning , by ferry to Algiers , with two wagons to load on the cars for Brashear , and then on the steamer for Franklin , and then to drive the rest of the way . But Burke 's head man , and she 's riding his wagon with him . Mr. Cresap , why did you let her ? " " Who says I could have stopped her ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught my lapels then , and began to pour it out  --  about how she had come into the shop last week , and wept and wailed and made a show of herself ; about how she hated Burke and did n't want to go . She was doing it forp122her father , the stake he has in cotton , but even for him would n't have gone if I had told her not to . " She said that ? To you , Mr. Lavadeau ? " " I swear she did , Mr. Cresap ! " " Did she say how she spit on me ? " " Oh , that she knows now she did wrong , knows everything about why you did what you did ; she made a mistake , she sees , and would be willing to start over , if only you 'd come in to say you 'd be willing too . If only she could be sure this other woman does n't mean anything to you . If --  " " Why could n't she come to me ? " " Sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't . " But he smiled , and told how he 'd brought her to methat very same afternoon , upstairs to my St. Charles suite : " She had her hand raised to knock , and then would n't . " " Why not , for instance ? " " For fear of who might be there . " Up until then he 'd been bitter , but now , having blown off steam , calmed down and stood there mumbling in French to himself . Then , to me , very friendly : " Well , it 's too late now . " He left me , and kept on down Gravier to St. Charles and the shop . I kept on up Gravier to Carondelet , but not to resume my walk . I turned the corner , and stumped along as fast as I could , to headquarters . " Dan , can I come in ? " " All right , but do n't abuse my welcome . " " What welcome ? " I stood in front of his table , took off my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think how to begin . He burst out : " Goddam it , quit bowing and scraping . " " Just trying to show my respect . " " I hate cringing . Sit down ! " He jumped up and grabbed a chair , shoving me down into it as though I were the ram in a bilge pump . I thanked him , then asked : " Dan , how have you been ? " " Rotten . " " Why do n't you ask me how I 've been ? " " I know how you 've been . You 've been fine . " " Well  --  that would seem to cover that . " " What do you want , Bill ? " " ... Dan , has your headquarters boat left ? " " Left ? For where ? " " The invasion . You said there 'd be one . " " It 's not even chartered yet . " " Oh . I heard the movement had started , and " " It has started  --  but we have n't , not this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And holding an inauguration . And a ball . Couple of balls . All kinds of variousthings , more important than taking the field . Why ? " " I want to be taken on board . " " In what capacity ? " " As  --  trader . In cotton . " " You ? Are going to buy cotton , Bill ? " " That 's the idea , Dan . I have n't told you all about what brought me to town . " I then sketched it out quick , the plan I 'd made with Sandy and my need for twenty-five thousand dollars . I went on : " From all that I hear around , the quickest way to get money is to join this Red River thing  --  seems to be like picking the stuff off trees . If you can get on this boat . "  | " And if you tell me no lies . " " But  --  what lies have I been telling ? " " That you 're taking this trip to make money . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That girl . She left for Red River last week . " " But listen : I need twenty-five thousand dollars . " " I know you do , Bill  --  I know all about it . " " Then where does the lie come in ? " " Bill , ever hear of a man named Dumont ? " " ... The banker ? I know him , yes . " " He was in , asking about you  --  said Miss Tremaine , the lady you brought to the ball , was fixing to marry you , then sell her business out and back you in another with the money you needed . He was for it , if you were an honest man  --  but if you already have the twenty-five thousand promised it proves you 're lying , does n't it ? " " What did you say about me ? " " Nice stuff  --  he went away quite happy . " " Could be I 'd rather make that tin myself . " " And could be you 'd rather have Mrs. Fournet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupted to know how I could make any tin , knowing nothing about cotton at all , I said : " What 's to know , Dan ? I go on your boat as a trader , I pile off at Alexandria along with the other traders , I buy stock off a Reb , which I still have money to do , I write up my receipt , listing bales by mark , number , and weight , I present it to the Q.M . officer making the seizure for him to sign . The rest is up to the lawyers . Is any of that beyond my comprehension ? " " Bill , I 've told you that cotton is hooded . " " Hoodooed ? This is not Hallowe'en . " " I 'm not talking about Hallowe'en , or anything super/stitious . All right , call it attaindered . But I 'm telling you , it 'll ruin whoever touches it , including you , including Burke , including Landry , including Mrs. Fournet  --  who 's a damned pretty girl mixed up in a damned ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is trying , this Army is trying  --  to buy a piece of this war to pay for our invasion by takingtraders along , by letting them put out tin for the cotton the Rebs have in storage . I 'm telling you , it ca n't be done ! There 's one piece of land that 's never yet been up for sale , and that 's the half-acre you need to plant a flagpole on . That you have to take ! It 's a people 's maidenhead  --  it wo n't give in by itself , and its price is blood . It 's what we 're forgetting , but we 'll pay the price , that price , or I 'm badly mistaken . Oh , our motives are good  --  why the hell would n't they be , what motive 's not better than war ? The idea , Washington thinks , is to kill three birds with one stone : Block the Reb government from shipping the cotton abroad and buying guns with it , give some individual Rebs a lick at the sugar pot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northern mills some stock to make shirts with for our soldiers . All right , but the only time I ever let go at three birds on a limb , I broke the dining-room window , cut my grandfather 's head , and landed a rock in my mother 's soup . But this will be worse : it 's treason . Why ? It takes two to make a sale , and in a war that means dealing with the enemy . The Reb army , if they let that cotton lay , if they fail to burn it when they evacuate Alexandria , have already heard the word as it 's been passed up the line . And we , if we pass the wink to the owners , those Rebs licking up sugar as we make the confiscation  --  we 're dealing with the enemy too . But , you say , not much  --  just a little bit . But I say , remember that maidenhead : there 's no such thingp126as one that 's been slightly took . And there 's going to be trouble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now why I say that cotton is hooded ? Do I have to say more ? " " I thought you were my friend , Dan . " " I 'm talking as your friend . " " You do n't sound much like it . " " I 'll prove it . My orders are to pass you . " " Pass me ? You mean to go on that boat ? " " Yes , that 's what I mean . " " Well , why do n't you ? " " Bill , do you know what impressed Mr. Dumont ? Not your Annapolis life  --  which I did n't know too much about , if I have to tell you the truth . But what you did right here , that brought him out of his chair . " " For Landry , are you talking about ? " " That 's right and it impressed us , too . " " Who is us ? " " This whole headquarters . They hated it , of course , but they respected you for it . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unfortunately might , blow this whole ship out of water . So the word came to me , pass this man in if he wants . " " Well ? If I 'm supposed to be rewarded " " I did n't say rewarded . " " Well what 's the point of it , then ? " " As a way of shutting you up . " I saw at last what he was driving at , and some time went by without either of us speaking . Then he said : Bill , I 've hacked at you , and  --  fact of the matter  --  you made me sore . Just the same , I knew an honest man was in town . Now , though , if you make a grab for that cotton , I have top127let you on the boat  --  but I wo n't feel the same . Bill , do n't make me change ! " After a long time I said : " I want on . " " So be it . " I took Marie everywhere  --  to dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the park with the smell of spring in the air . I helped address the wedding announcements , as soon as they came from the engraver . When my pass for the boat came to the hotel one day , I told myself it meant nothing , that I had no intention of using it , that I 'd just been blowing off steam . But the following Monday night we went to see Richard III at the St. Charles Theatre . The actor was John Wilkes Booth . He 's from Maryland too , and maybe he 's kind to dogs , and drops coins in the blind man 's cup . But in that play he has death in his eyes , and watching him I knew I meant to go , and knew what I meant to do . I had death in my heart  --  that was the real answer . Whose death I did n't yet know , but the following day , March 22 , 1864 , for the second time I ran out on a woman who loved me.  |p128ALEXANDRIA  WAS JUST LIKE THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of steamers tied up at the bank , and the hoodoo on top of the courthouse  --  which I had n't believed in before , but now was beginning to , on account of something that happened on the boat coming up . We 'd left from the foot of Canal Street , twelve noon two days before , on a sidewheeler called the Black Hawk . We carried on the boiler deck General , staff , headquartersnoncoms , and headquarters orderlies ; on the main deck horses , Louisiana volunteers , newspapermen , and traders ; wherever they could fit waiters , hostlers , and hangers-on . It was kind of a tight squeeze , but I made out all right since I 'd brought what the trip called for . After kissing Marie good night with the Judas taste on my mouth , I 'd spent the small hours packing , and divided my stuff in two bags . One I checked with the hotel , the other I filled withp129field stuff , including sandwiches I had the hotel put up and my gun . I wore my corduroys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea voyage plus a canteen at my belt I figured to do all right , and did . I bunked in , or wedged in , with the traders , aft of the shaft , in the passage leading back to the fantail . They were a strange bunch , half of them sharpshooter businessmen , the rest politicians , all full of windy guff , like the pair holding Lincoln passes , those two slips of paper that muxed everythingup , causing headquarters , as it did , to accept them as a tip-off of what Washington really wanted  --  unlimited trade in cotton as a matter of public policy . Some had brought bagging , rope , and gear on board the boat , and piled it up so there was hardly room to step ; they were so hungry for cotton they expected to bale the loose stuff on plantations after the regular stock in storage had all been bought up . But nobody made complaint , and we all shook down very friendly , standing around in the afternoon , pitching banana skins in the wake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side of the engine room to visit the newspapermen . But as dark was settling down and the crew was lighting lamps , Dan showed up to ask me how things were going . By then , bottles were being passed and jokes were being cracked , so he took a look and beckoned me forward . We ducked under the shaft and went up into the bow , where the horses were , and the hostlers had rigged a tarp to shield them from the breeze . We stood by the rail , and after Dan had done his manners with me , he stared at the shore , very gloomy . When I asked what the trouble was , he answered : " Nothing , Bill  --  and everything . This damned invasion , mainly . " " Did something go wrong ? I thought it was on . "  | " It is on  --  it started two weeks ago . By now the advancemust be in Alexandria . But Bill , it 's a queer ; it keeps me awake at night . " " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's in three prongs , as I guess you know  --  Army , Navy , and Bummers . Sherman 's lending us ten thousand men , but those bastards always mean trouble . Besides , there 's no real chain of command . " " But is n't the General in charge ? " " Well , is he ? Or is n't he ? And if so , how ? " " Dan , I do n't have answers for you . " " If he 's in charge , he 's in charge too many ways . No man can hold an election , dance the polka , inaugurate Hahn , dabble in cotton , and command a campaign all at the same time . They 're asking too much of him ! And he should have been there ! At Alexandria , for the rendezvous . It was set for March seventeenth , when the three prongs should meet , but how could he be there , with these other things to do ? " " But has something gone wrong ? " " Not actually  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Has there been any fighting so far ? " " Little . The Bummers took a fort . " " Well Dan ? If they took it  --  " " Bill , this bunch you 're with is no help . " " They 're what 's really griping you , are n't they ? " " The cotton is . It 's what really scares me . " " But why , if this hoodoo is all you have to go on ? Or some theoretical attainder  --  that ca n't amount to much , if Lincoln 's given his blessing . " " Lincoln 's not here . " " But you 've nothing definite to go on ? "  | " No  --  I 'm scared and do n't know why . " " It 's a funny way to be scared . " " It 's the worst way there is . " He found out why soon enough , before we even got to Alexandria . We stopped next day at Port Hudson , which is a levee , a bluff , and some houses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished themselves at the siege the previous year . Everyone went ashore , including me , but not caring to climb the bluff I passed up the review , went back on board , and stood in the bow chatting with a mate . Then everyone came back  --  the General , the staff , the enlisted men , the correspondents , and last of all the traders . But their faces , previously wreathed in grins from the money they hoped to make , now black with scowls , told me something was wrong ; at once I started to follow them back to their part of the boat to find out what it was . But I had to stand aside while the deckhands pulled in the hawser after the boat cast off . While I was waiting Dan came down the stairs from the main saloon . He beckoned me to the same spot by the rail we 'd stood at the night before and went on , almost as though there 'd been no break . " Well , " he said , " the hoodoo'son . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " The Navy 's got the cotton . " " You mean , they made the confiscation ? " " Not quite . They made the capture . " " I do n't quite get the distinction . " " Navy does n't operate under the Confiscation Act , but under the Law of Prize  --  they keep all the money , they divide it between themselves , but a prize has to be captured.  |p132And  you do n't give receipts to a capture . So no claim can be made for that cotton ; it ca n't be litigated . " As I nodded , getting the point , he went on : " Kind of funny , at that , how they worked it . They were telling us here at Port Hudson , some boys who got shipped downriver , on account of their time being up . The rendezvous , as I told you , was set for the seventeenth , but the Navy beat the gun . They got there the fifteenth , and the town  --  to be helpful  --  sent the mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he did n't even get his painter taken on board  --  they fended him off like smallpox , for fear of what it would mean if they even heard the word surrender . Next morning , a detachment from the Eastport  --  your friend Sandy 's boat  --  marched up to the warehouse and smashed in the door with rifle butts . The owner was right there , waving the keys in their face  --  but they had to use force to make it stick as a capture . " " Well , we live and we learn . " " From the Navy , we all learn plenty . " " But at least , you 're out from under . " " You mean this Army ? Bill , I 'm not so sure . " " But if the Navy has the cotton ? " " Listen , Bill , the handshake was passed  --  and the Rebs left us the cotton when they pulled out of the town . Then the Navy stole it off us . All right , so that leaves these traders holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was our handshake . " " What are you leading to , Dan ? " " How do I know ? But I smell still more trouble . " " Well , at worst we 'll have to fight . " " Yes , Bill , but can we ? " He said what a poor army it was , a lot of the boys having enlisted as settlers in Texas , the rest of them soft from an idle winter , from laying up with colored girls , andp133from foraging for rum . He repeated : " And there 's no proper chain of command . " And then , turning to look at me : " Bill , you do n't seem much upset . " " . . . Why should I be ? " " That twenty-five thousand dollars . Losing it must be tough . " " I 'd almost forgotten about it . " " Then you were lying , were n't you ? " " Well ? I had to get me to Alexandria . " " At least , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all along , or I would n't be down here talking with you . And she is a damned nice girl . " " If she is , she is . " " Meaning , Bill ? " " It 's what I 'm on my way to find out . " " In other words , whether she 's sleeping with Burke ? " I recoiled as though I 'd been hit , and knew that was how he intended it . He watched my face , drilling me with his eyes , and then went on : " Bill , do n't you go shooting that Irishman , for her . I 'm telling you , do n't you do it ! Right now , he 's a case of smallpox , with everyone afraid to give him a kind word for fear of being mixed up in some of his schemes . But dead , so nothing more can be proved , he 'll have a thousand friends  --  and that town 's under martial law . We 'll try the case , and we have jurisdiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll hang . " " I must play the hand as it 's dealt . " " It 's what I 'm asking of you . " " Suppose she is sleeping with Burke ? " " She 's still a nice girl , damn it  --  she would n't be the first to do just exactly that ! But is n't it enough for you to give her the big hee-haw , for getting the little end of the stick ? And Burke the big hee-haw ? And Landry thep134big hee-haw  --  specially him , because if he 'd renounced the tin , she would n't be up there now . Is n't laughing cheaper than lead ? " " Is it better than lead is the question . " " It 's better than rope , goddam it . " When I argued no more about it , he studied me and then left , perhaps detecting I 'd weakened , because the truth was that once the full meaning of what the Navy had done had soaked in I 'd begun to have twitches of hope along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing , and then picture her turning to me , now the scheme had blown up , and asking my forgiveness , and picturedmyself taking her in my arms and telling her our love was all that mattered . And so the long afternoon wore on . We spoke the station ship , a walking-beam boat of the kind we have back home . We ran past her , came about , then ran down into Lower Old River . After six or eight miles of that , racing with the current , we nosed into the Red . Night began settling down , and in the morning it started to rain . After miles of desolate country blighted by the war , suddenlyhere came the cotton , thousands of bales on a barge , under the arm of a Navy steamer . It passed so close we could almost touch it , and the traders watched it and cursed . Ahead was Alexandria , all brick , green , iron lace , and drizzle . Then we were swinging into Alexandria 's upper wharf and crashing into the Navy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , I did n't make a mistake . Their flag was on the Black Hawk and our headquarters on the Black Hawk  --  two boats with the same name , lying side by side , spreading nothing but mux . It was that kind of invasion.  | " YES , GENTLEMEN , it is a big hotel , and one of the best , we hope . Nevertheless , appearance can be deceiving , and we do n't have any room . The first floor , as you see , has lobby , bar , lounge , dining room , and drugstore  --  but no place to sleep . The third floor 's a theater  --  no place to sleep up there . The second floor , it 's true , has twenty-four rooms , but unfortunately , when you inflicted your war on us , we had just finished building and our inventory never came . They 're big , beautiful rooms , but except for a few , already taken , they 're empty  --  no beds , no rugs , no basins , no anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shoot . However , we 're kindly disposed , and will do what we can for you . For meals , you may come and we 'll see that you 're fed . For lodging , we have houses for rent belonging to people who went upriver when they heard your invasion was coming  --  and I do n't blame them ,  |p136do  you ? They 've left their keys with me , and if you 'll kindly pay attention , I 'll call out who they are , the kind of house they have , and how many it will accommodate  --  terms cash . Cash in advance to the first of the month , and cash in advance for each month thereafter ! May I repeat , in advance ? No refunds ! " He began picking up keys and reading stuff off tickets they had tied to them , and voices would call out , from the bunch of traders , correspondents , and hangers-on standing around the lobby , which was big , with leather chairs and settees , as well as desks that had signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STAGE LINES . Mostly , they bespoke by twos , threes , and fours , depending on how many wanted to share the accommodation , but pretty soon he hit a snag , offering a place with no takers : " Over-the-store flat on Front Street , clean fine place with bang-up space for four . " As he repeated his spiel I came alert when I happened to catch the name , Schmidt . I sang out : " Yo ! " and he slapped the key down in front of me , saying : " That 'll be fifty dollars to the first of April . " I paid , and then was clumping down the street , my bedroll over one shoulder , my bag in my hand , past a town I knew like a book from the talk I 'd heard about it that night at the Landry flat and the pictures I 'd been shown of it . Sure enough , below the corner , its windows looking out at the stern of the flag boat , I came to the store , its windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further on to a place with vats inside , its windows lettered Friedrich Schmidt , Sugar Mill Supplies . Beside each place was a little green gate , and back of that a small alley . I went up the exterior stairway to a little platform , used my key , and went in . I stepped into a hallway , crosswise the flat , whichp137led to another hallway at right angles to the crosshall . This was apparently the common wall between the two flats , and would have been dark except for the skylight , the one she 'd talked about . To the right , at the end of that hall , was a front sitting room , which I went into after dropping my stuff , and raised the shades to look at . It was as dreary a place as I 'd ever seen . On the floor was coconut matting , which the whole place smelled of , like some unventilated Sunday School room . The construction was tongue-and-groove board , the paint mustard-color , the furniture carved oak with cushions tied on , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kings . The decorations were china dogs , china steins , china jars with gilded cattails in them , china heads that grinned at you , and meerschaum pipes in racks . The heads , which were life-size , were tobacco jars and had tops with sponges in them . Back through the hall again , past the skylight , I peeped into doors , finding bedrooms , a bath with tub hung to the wall but no water connection , a dining room , kitchen , and pantry . The pantry had shelves with cooking things on them , a trap door in the floor , and a short stepladder , apparently for the skylight . The kitchen had a range , woodbin , sink , and pump . Out the window , when I opened it , was the bath cistern she had spoken of , on its trestle . From the roof , spouting led down , now tinkling with water runningthrough , and on it I spotted the valve , an arrangementattached by a screw sleeve and worked with a wooden handle . I put in about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up when I tell what happened that night , but the truth is I only half-noticed them now . My mind was completely on her , not on what I saw . I left the window up for air ,  |p138took  my stuff into a bedroom , and sat down for a moment to get ready for what I 'd do next . But the beat of my heart told me , without my having to think . After what Lavadeau had said and what the Navy had done , I had every reason to play it friendly , without giving way to the thoughts I 'd struggled with after seeing John Wilkes Booth . So , when I had myself under control , I straightened up my oilskin , went down the stairs to the alley , around in front of the stores , and up the other stairs which led from the banquette of the street to another second-floor platform . I knocked and she opened , still in her little black dress that by now was downright shabby . " Oh , " she said , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I heard someone stumping around in the other flat , and I thought it might be you . You 're the only cripple I knew of that it might be . " " Yes , " I said , " I rented the Schmidt place . " Then , stepping out to the platform rail and staring down at the street : " Did Marie come with you ? " " No , she 's still in New Orleans . " " Well , I was going to say , little as she has on whenever I see her , she must be cold down there in the rain and might want to come in . " " I doubt if she would , but thanks . " " I hear she 's backing your firm ? " " There 's been talk about it , that 's true . " " She 's awful rich . Or filthy rich , I 've heard said . " " But sixteen hundred dollars poorer than she was . " That crack about the notes Marie had torn up hit the mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face getting red and her eyes shining , and snapped : " What did you come for ? What do you want ? " " Nothing , " I said , my friendliness slightly evaporatedp139by now , " except to commiserate  --  for your selling your backside off and getting nothing for it . " " What are you talking about ? " " The cotton  --  that you did it all for , and then saw snatched away . Oh , I heard ; the Navy gave no receipts . Is your father in ? I 'd like to condole with him too , for making a pimp of himself , renting his daughter out to the same rotten harp as stabbed him in the back , and then having nothing to show . " But instead of slamming the door , as I fully expected her to , she stared and changed her expression to the same icy smile as she 'd had when she opened it . " Father 's out , " she said very sweetly . " We eat a lot of vension these days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who brings it in . But there 's no reason at all to condole  --  our receipt is already signed . Of course , " she went on , in a quiet , reasonableway , " I do n't say they 'd have signed for every pipsqueak here in town , like some poor hippity-hop , workingwomen to back his company  --  but when a man showed up with his paper , someone big , like we 'll say Mr. Burke , they get out their pen , pretty quick . We do n't need any sympathy , but of course thanks just the same . " " Well then , congratulations . " " Will there be anything else ? " " Not that I think of at this time . " " Then , as we 'll be taking the first boat out when the Army gets to Shreveport , can we say goodbye now ? " " Certainly . Goodbye . " " Give my love to Marie . " So I came , I saw , and I certainly did not conquer . I did n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't help any , when I got back to my horrible sitting room , that I was all atremble just from seeing her , hearing her and , worst of all , smelling her . But then , little by little , it began to dig at me there was something funny about it  --  that receipt , I mean . Because , although Burke might once have been big with the Army , I knew of no heft he had with the Navy , and it was the Navy that had grabbed the cotton . And the legal aspect of it , from what Dan had said , was so peculiar it seemed incredible they would have waived it in any way . It also seemed incredible , considering that icy smile , that if Burke had thought of some shyster trick , or her father had , or she had , she would n't have walloped me with it , just for fun . And yet I was mortally certain , from the bragging way she had acted , that the receipt had been signed , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time not have been ? I did n't have the answer , but did have someone to go to for background information that might throw light on the subject . That was Sandy Gregg , whose ship , the Eastport , had made the cotton " capture , " according to Dan . By then the rain had stopped , so I piled out on the street again , asked my way of a bluejacket , and off the lower end of the town spotted an ironclad lying out in midstream . Her texas and staterooms had all been stripped away , and she was dented , scarred , and scaly , but did answermy hail . Then there was Sandy , at one of the gunports , staring in disbelief . He 's a trim , dark , medium-sized lad , fairly good-looking , but right now in his old blues almost as rusty as his ship . However , he called to the cutter lying at the wharf I was talking from and had them bring me out . He welcomed me aboard cordially , and introducedp141me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was shaking hands kept asking over and over : " Bill , what are you doing here ? What the hell are you doing here ? " Well , what was I doing there ? The truth , supposing I even knew it , was the last thing I wanted to own , so I fell back on my original story , the one I 'd told to Dan before he smoked me out . " Well , " I said , pretty testy , " you ought to know what I 'm doing here . We need twenty-five thousand dollars , and this looked like the quickest place to get it . " And then , not giving him time to speak : " And I can get it , I think , if the parties I 've been referred to as having cotton to sell me show up as they 're supposed to . But what worries me is this : If I do buy their titles , can I get a receipt ? " " You 're here as a trader then ? " " I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cotton you 're after was stored ? " " In Rachal 's Warehouse , I believe it 's called . " " Bill , we captured that cotton last week . " " Oh I know about that  --  I saw it ; we passed the barge coming up . But condemnation rests with a court , and fact of the matter , the battle has n't started till a court calls the case in New Orleans . " " Springfield . " " ... Springfield ? " " Illinois . That cotton 's headed for Cairo . " " Oh , I did n't know that . " " Bill , if you buy titles , you 're sunl ' " You mean , on-the-bottom sunk ? " " I mean , in-the-mud sunk . We 're both sunk . " " But tell me : Have any receipts been signed ? " " No , Bill , none . "  | " If any had been , would you know it ? " " Detail from this ship made the capture  --  I was n't in command , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd know it . " But one of the boys he 'd introduced me to , who was in earshot as we talked on the bow , said something , and Sandy corrected himself : " Oh that 's right , I forgot . One of our officers , Lieutenant Powell , could have signed something ; of that we ca n't be sure . He did shore duty evenings , up at the Ice House Hotel , hearing civilian complaints  --  andgot plugged by a skulker one night as he stepped out of the hotel to come back to the ship . " " Why does n't Cresap talk to Ball ? " That was the boy who had interrupted , and Sandy said : " That 's right , Ball would know . He 's on that duty now , and has all Powell 's notes . " " Can I see him ? " " He 's asleep , but he 'll be at the hotel tonight . " " Then  --  I 'll talk to him there . " " Now , Bill , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? " " The twenty-five thousand dollars . " I was in the unfortunate position , I discovered , that he 'd swallowed my whole yarn . He took the twenty-five thousand dollars very seriously , feeling he was to blame , not only for our needing it but , still worse , for our not having it . So for an hour I had to fence , while he asked all kinds of questions about who my " parties " were . Finally , when I admitted I had no idea , he looked so utterly baffled I had to do something , quick . I slipped off a bill from the roll I had in my pocket , tore it in two with my fingertips , then came up with one half and said : " All I know is , they 're to presentp143me with identification , the matching half of this . Until they do , I do n't know them from Adam , and ca n't even guess who they are . And maybe , from your account of the seizure , or capture as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . " It satisfied him , but I went back to my flat more shaken than before , if such a thing was possible . I was no nearer the answer to my riddle , but quite a lot nearer the poorhouse . I had supposed , when I tore the bill , that I was wrecking a twenty , but saw when I looked it was fifty . Perhaps , I told myself , it would be just as good as new if pasted together again , but as I fingered and folded and eyed it , it was one more silly thing in a dreary , complete fiasco . I 'd done better than I knew.  |p144WHATEVER  I HAD OR HAD N'T FOUND OUT , I still had to eat , so around 6:3o I walked up to the hotel . It was jammed , and I did n't get a seat until the third or fourth table . But I bought my ticket , and then saw Dan come in and beckon to the newspapermen . When they 'd gathered around him , he gave them the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Natchitoches  --  " Nackitosh , " he called it ; the Navy was having some trouble from low water on the falls , the stretch of rapid water just above the town , but several boats were up , and no serious delay had been caused . In other words , everything was moving according to schedule . But when he 'd finished with them and dropped into a chair beside me , he had nothing to say and seemed in a sour humor . I said : " Why all the gloom if the sun is shining so bright ? " He said : " It is , in a pig 's eye , " and then , mysterious : " You want to see something , Bill ? Meet me out back . "  |p145So  I did , slipping out past the desk in under the stairs , through a door between the dining room and a big lounge with a stove in it . In a moment , there he was , in among the hotel 's steam boiler , gas tank , and cistern , pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky back of town was pink . He said : " That glow is cotton they 're burning out there  --  from some plantation gin on the Opelousas Road . They 've been doing it , I 'm told , every night since the Navy crossed them . We hear they hate our guts . " " Yes , but since when did they love us ? " " They were all ready to think things over . " " You 're hipped on that hoodoo , Dan . " " I 'm telling you , it 's going to dog us . " " The cotton 's gone  --  it 's on it 's way to Cairo for condemnationin Springfield . The rest is a new deal . " " We have n't heard the end . " When I did n't respond he got sore , and circled the tailor shop at one side to return to the headquarters boat without going back through the hotel . I went in and at last got a place for dinner , which was n't too bad : corned beef , cabbage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real coffee  --  the first sign of a change when the Union comes to town . When I went out into the lobby again , Ball was back of the stagecoach desk , a grizzled , seamy twostriperwho looked like an old river pilot , which is probablywhat he was . He was talking to a woman about her son who 'd been captured , but spotted me and called me over , telling her to wait . He shook hands , saying : " Mr. Cresap , Sandy Gregg said you 'd come  --  I know you by his description . " " I 'm easy described , " I said , waving the stick . " He never mentioned it . He spoke only about yourp146beauty  --  and that torn fifty-dollar bill you have . Could I see it just once , Mr. Cresap ? " I got one half of it out , and when he loved it as though it was alive I realized I had a pass , by just a crazy accident , to a lodge I 'd never heard of . He said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how that carries me back . Mr. Cresap , before annexation , and the tariff changes of Fortysix , everything was protected  --  from jumping jacks to sewing machines  --  and the smuggling that went on , especially here in the South , had to be seen to be believed . Jefferson , Texas , was the Lone-Star port of entry , and Shreveport of course was ours . We had , and still have , the long , narrow steamers , and what they took through the bayous  --  TwelveMileBayou to Lake Caddo , and Big Bayou to Red River  --  ran into the millions , sir . And with every dummy manifest , I 'd be given this same bill  --  a fifty torn once , to match a piece I had in my wallet . Well , when you show me this I know you have real friends , and I may as well tell you the truth  --  or they will . So : Our orders , here in the Navy , are to receipt for loyal cotton , whether captured or not . But which Red River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none . It 's all been impressed , we 've been told , by the Confederatebureau at Shreveport , for export you know how they do ? Haul to Texas , then ship through Mexico ? " I said I knew about it , and he went on : " So much for what we heard . There 's also the element of confusion . Did Sandy speak of the stencil ? " " ... Stencil ? I do n't think so . " " When we capture a bale we stencil it USN to keep things straight . And the boys  --  no order was given , it was strictly a fo'c'sle idea  --  they put an extra stencil on , CSA  --  all perfectly honest , since it meant Cotton Stealing Association , U.S. Navy . But a court could easy conclude itp147meant Confederate States of America . Well now , could n't it ? But why , you may ask , could n't a court open its mouth and inquire what the stencil meant ? All right , since you ask , I 'll say . Under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sufficient to its adjudification '  --  that 's what he said , adjudification  --  that closes the case , no more evidence can be heard . So the court ca n't inquire , the law do n't permit it ! So you , Mr. Cresap , are sitting in the soup , so far as cotton 's concerned that was stored in Rachal 's Warehouse , and that 's offered you for sale . Am I making the point clear ? " " I think I get it , yes . " " CSA  --  CSA , they 're one and the same . " " We could say , like Black Hawk  --  Black Hawk . " " That 's it ! War is war ! " Then , leaning close : " I ask you right out , Mr. Cresap : Have you bought in on this cotton or have n't you ? " " Not actually , Lieutenant Ball . " " Then do n't ! Save your tin ! " " I 'll remember what you say . Thanks . " He called the woman over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd do what he could to get the boy released . Then he leaned back and started in again about the old days of the smugglers , in the time of the Texas Republic , when all of a sudden he stopped , as a man in moleskins , jackboots , and felt hat leaned over toward him . We were seated facing each other , he behind the desk , I beside it , my back to the lobby . He looked up , said : " Mr. Burke , I 'm sorry I have no news  --  we 're taking nobody upriver until the occupation is complete . " " But I must get to Shreveport , " said the familiar voice , " before I leave for Springfield , to see to me interests there.  |p148I  've a tremenjous opportunity to buy a parcel of cotton on the Sabine , back of the town  --  " " The Pulaski dump ? " " Aye , a cache of five thousand bales , no less ! " " But the Army has boats too . Why not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences . " " Well with this Army , who would n't have differences  --  we have a few ourselves . But for two million in cotton , I would n't be too damned proud . Why do n't you hop a wagon ? You do n't need a pass for that . " " ' T is an idea ; I 'll think it over . " They batted it back and forth , and perhaps to change the subject , Ball suddenly asked : " Did the little lady cross ? To visit that grave in Pineville ? Her mother 's , I think you said ? " " She 's  --  been a bit under the weather . " " She still has Powell 's pass ? " " Aye  --  she remembers 'm in her prayers . " " Whenever she 's ready , any cutter 'll take her . " " And she 's grateful , have no doubt of it . " " Funny , Mr. Burke , I 've often thought about it : How could they lay out this town so neat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know . What 's the idea ? Do they figure to live forever ? " " As they tell it , many of 'm do . " " Not Powell , unfortunately . " " Have you word of the wretch who killed 'm ? " " Not yet . But God help him when we catch up . " " To that a brace of amens . " They came back to her again , Burke saying how " slimsy " she 'd felt today , " especially with the rain . " Howp149long it went on , I do n't know , but more than just a few seconds , as I had my back to the lobby , and Burke could n't see who was there  --  and long enough for stuff to go through my head . I thought : Since when was she " slimsy " today ? She had n't looked slimsy to me , and in fact was chock full of mean , rotten ginger . Then I thought : If she was n't slimsy , why should he say she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought : Why has n't she used it , for instance ? I thought all that without caring too much . But then suddenlyit hit me like a sledge : Suppose she 's not going to use it ? Suppose it was just a trick to get Powell 's specimen signature , so Burke could forge the receipt the Navy would n't give ? And suppose that 's why Powell got killed , so he could n't deny his name in court ? For one heartbeat , she was guilty as hell to me and one heartbeat again , I felt the same feeling as Booth had had in his eyes . But then , as always , came the excuse I made for her : Suppose , I thought , she knew nothing about the pass ? Suppose he 'd got it for her so he could forge the receipt , and conveniently forgot to tell her ? That would tie in with the way she 'd acted with me , bragging about the receipt , and certainly believing he had one . It would also put her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why Powell was shot  --  right on the gallows step . Because , when they searched Burke 's papers , they 'd find the pass in her name , the receipt with identical signature , and nothing to show she had n't been in on the trick . By the time he looked down and saw me , I was well on my way , I knew , to solving two or three mysteries , all in one fell swoop . " Hello , Burke , " I said . " . . . What are you doing here , Cresap ? " " Was talking to the lieutenant . Am talking to you . " " What business have you with me ? "  | " You 'll find out . Thanks , Lieutenant Ball . " As Ball , kind of puzzled , gave me a wary wave , I led to the DEMOCRAT desk and took my seat behind it , but then saw that Burke had n't moved . " Of course , " I called , " IFYOU WANT THE NAVY TO HEAR - " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick steps , pulling up a chair so he could sit close . But I kicked it out from under him . I said : " Stand when talking to me . " Talking to you ? About what ? " " Could n't we say a slight case of murder ? " " Are you out of your mind ? Whose ? " " Lieutenant Powell 's , perhaps  --  whose name you got on a pass , so she could cross the river ; then used his specimensignature , to forge one on the receipt , the Navy 's receiptfor your cotton , as you forged the informer notes last month down in New Orleans ; and then you killed him so he could n't deny it in court ! " " Cresap , I think you 're crazy . " " I do n't , that 's the difference  --  and the question is , what do we do about it ? I was n't here , I did n't see it , I do n't have to turn you in  --  it all hinges on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as to whether they 're guilty too . If not , I ca n't turn you in , but I can destroy your papers , to cut you out , and them out , of every dime of the hundred-twenty thousand you thought you 'd make from this crime . If they are as guilty as you are , I 'm turning you all three in  --  you , your partner , and her . I do n't care how pretty she is , or whether you love her or not , or whether anyone does , she 's going to swing ! " I let that soak in as he stood there licking his lips , then went on : " So that 's what we 're doing now  --  goingp151into it , to see what 's what , and who gets his neck broke . Come on , we 're paying them a call  --  now . " " ' Twill suit me very well . " " Then fine , let 's go . " " But I 've a suggestion , me boy  --  when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fournet , of course , why do n't we all go to my house  --  after all , me papers are there . ' T is quite a decent place I took on Second Street in the block below the market , back of Adolphe 's store  --  we can make ourselves comfortable there , and I 'll prove to you once and for all how mistaken you are . " " If they agree , your house sounds fine . " " Then ' t is settled , and let 's be off ! " It was settled  --  a little too much . Because I 'd worked myself out on a limb and was neatly sawing it off . To own the truth , I 'd come without my gun , not supposing I 'd need it . And how far I was going to get , walking down the street in the company of this man I was sure had killed the lieutenant , I did n't like to think . With the stored-up venom I 'd had , I had let myself go regardless , but now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall . However , that venom saved me , as everyone there stopped talking and turned my way , and the clerk , the same stiff-necked one who had rented the houses out , got so concerned , as my vicious whispering kept on , that he strolled to the door , stepped out , and called : " Corporal of the Guard ! Corporal of the Provost Guard ! " In a moment a soldier was there , not a corporal but a private , belted for duty with sidearms , who took things in with one look and came over to Burke and me . " What 's going on here ? " he wanted to know . " What seems to be the trouble ? "  | " Nothing , " I said . " Just a nice , sociable brawl that 's nobody 's business but ours . " But then , thinking fast , I added : " But I feel my life in some danger , going home tonight , and if you 'd ask your corporal , or whoever 's in command , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliged . " " Where do you live , sir ? " " Schmidt store , block and a half down . " " It 's on my post . I 'll take you there myself . " " And me , " said Burke . " Me life 's in danger too . " That got a laugh , for some reason , and we got a laugh and a hand when the boy formed us up , Burke and me in front , he bringing up the rear , and we marched out the door . Even Ball was laughing , but for once that day I did n't feel like a dolt . We were quite a noisy parade , going down the street , the guard 's heels clopping , my stick clicking , my corduroys whining , and Burke 's jackboots whispering like a deck of cards being riffled . When we got to our corner I told Burke to rouse out Mr. Landry and Mrs. Fournet while I got some stuff I 'd need , and then , after thanking the guard , I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform , and into my flat with my key . I was no sooner in than I scrambled fast to the bedroom , clawed into the bag , and after scattering all kinds of stuff  --  sandwiches , clothes , and gear  --  I got my hooks on the gun . I dropped it in my pocket , not bothering with the harness , then went down to the street again . The guard was still on the corner , lookingup at the Landry flat , where Burke was on the platform , beating on the door , and calling loudly in French . Not a sound came from inside , and no light showed . " They do n't answer , " he said peevishly.  | " I bet they do n't , " I said , " after you told them not to , in that trick language you speak with them . They 'll answer me , though . " " Hey , you ! " That was the guard , snapping it out as I started up , and stopping me in my tracks . He called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ordering us " to your billets , or you 'll spend the night in the clink . " I told Burke : " You be at my place in the morning , with them , both of them , do you hear  --  at nine , sharp . " Then I watched him march off in the dark , thanked the guard once again , and went back up to my flat . I bolted the door , lit a half candle that was there in an iron stick , hung up my clothes in the armoire in the bedroom , put on my nightshirt , and went to bed . As I reached for the candle to blow it out , there grinningat me from the night table was one of the china heads . I said : " My friend , for once , the joke is not on me , and you have n't seen anything yet . Just you wait till tomorrow , and you may really have something to laugh at . "  |p154I  HAD SLEPT A LONG TIME , several hours from the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prickle up my back that told me I was n't alone . Whether I heard anything I do n't know , but I could have , as I was so well-slept-out the slightest sound would have reached me . I stared at the dark , wondering how anyone , short of a conjure trick , could have slid those bolts on the door to get in . Then I remembered the window , the one by the cistern , that I 'd opened and forgotten about . From the wall , the tongue-and-groove partition between room and hall , came a sound  --  the faint , trembling rub that a hand would make feeling its way along from the rear of the flat . I groped for where I 'd hung the gun in its harness on the bedpost . When I had it I lay there for a moment , but at the sound of another rub began to feel like a sitting duck . I slid out , grabbed one of the pillows and shoved it under the covers in such way that itp155made a bulge , then took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suddenly a man was there , sleeping . I crouched down with the gun by the side of the bed , out of sight , waiting . The rub was repeated again , still closer to the door . Then the latch clicked and the hinge spoke . The door opened by inches and a dark shadow was there . I wanted to growl " Hands up , " but made myself bite it back , to give this shadow its chance to move farther into the room , so I could jump between it and the door and cut off any retreat . I had no doubt it was Burke ; if I could hold him at gun 's point , then I could go ahead without turning him in yet or starting something I could n't stop . I could beat on the wall between flats , get Mignon and her father over , and have my showdown at once : find out who was guilty of what . If she had connived at that pass , letting Burke bespeak it for her as a preliminary to murdering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her no less than the others . If that seems unduly mean , all I can say is that I could still smell her spit , and she 'd done nothing the day before to make me forget its aroma . But if she had n't known of the pass , if she 'd become an unwitting accessory , then I meant to stand pat until somebody brought me the papers . When I 'd stuffed them into the stove and made her touch them off with a match , then I 'd feel myself hunk and be able to take a new start  --  Me me back to New Orleans , begin again looking for twenty-five thousand dollars , perhaps take up with Marie , if she was still speaking to me . That , some kind of way but fairly clearly , I think , is what went through my mind as I crouched there holding my breath . But then , in one blazing second , it all got out of hand , and the smoke that filled the room could not bep157stuffed back in the shells . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then the room filled with light and there came a crash  --  the ear-splitting crash a gun makes when it 's fired indoors . And then self-preservation , which seems to be stronger somehow than any plan you can make  --  for getting hunk or otherwise  --  got into it . While china still clattered around from the shot smashing the head , I fired by reflex action , not knowing I would . Then I fired again , on purpose . You ca n't sight a gun in the dark , but your hand will do it for you , and the thud on the floor told me I 'd found my mark . I circled the bed , felt around with my bare toe , touched a gun . I picked it up , shook what was lying there to see if it still lived . It did n't move , so I knew I had to  --  and move by the book , quick . I made my way to the sitting room , threw up the window , and called : " Corporalof the Guard , help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banging a shot in the night , in the prescribed military way . Then I got a military answer : " Corporal of the Guard  --  yo ! We hear you ! Who are you who call ? Locate yourself and we 'll come ! " " Schmidt store , second floor , Front Street ! " " On our way , coming up ! " I ducked for the bedroom again , but in the hall came a whisper from the dark : " Willie ! Are you all right ? " " Mignon ! For God 's sake , where are you ? " " Here ! Ca n't you see ? " Something touched my head , and when I grabbed itit was her hand , reaching down from the skylight . For amoment , one tremendous moment , her fingers locked withmine , and then she repeated , " Willie ! Are you all right ? " " Yes , but will you go ? I 've had to kill a man , Burke , Ip157think . The Provost Guard 's on its way  --  and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died when I heard those shots ! " " Heard them ? Where the hell have you been ? " " Home ! Where do you think ? " " Then why did n't you answer Burke 's knock ? " " With Father not home ? I would n't answer anyone 's knock ! It 's the one protection I have , and  --  " " You answered my knock , though . " " Well ? I knew it was you .... As for Frank  --  " " Never mind about him . He 's dead . " " I 've been trying to tell you : I do n't care . " I shook her hand , as a mother shakes a child , to make it listen . I said : " Mignon , you have to care , or everything 's in the soup ! Things have been going on that I ca n't take time to explain  --  terrible things that you ca n't know about , or you would n't be talking this way ! Things that can land you on the gallows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cover up ! I do , you do , your father does , especially about those papers in Burke 's house ! So if you hear me talkingfunny , do n't you undercut me , do n't you get in it , giving your two cents ' worth ! I 'll have my reasons , and your life is at stake ! Mignon , do you hear what I say ? " " My , but you sound funny . " " Do you understand ? " " Yes , Willie , bu7t ) are you all right ? " " I am ! Now , will you go ? " " You do n't even sound like yourself . " " Mignon , here comes the Provost Guard ! " At last , she pulled back her head and lowered the frame as footsteps sounded outside . My heart raced as I went to the door , and my head was spinning around be/cause , of course , from her failure to answer Burke and the way she acted with me , she 'd never lived up with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least any scheme leading to Powell 's murder . It put a different light on everything . I opened to the corporal , who was carrying a bull'seyelantern , and two of his men , then led at once to the bedroom . But when he threw his beam I got my first jolt . The thing on the floor was n't Burke , but Pierre Legrand , the gippo . The corporal took both guns , which by then I had in one hand , sniffed them , and put them on the night table . Then he opened Pierre 's reefer and felt around in his pockets , perhaps for some identification . He did n't seem to find any , which suddenly tipped me off that he was n't known to soldiers just recently here , and might n't be , at least right away , if I played my cards right . So when I was asked , I told everything just as it happened , except that I used the word prowler and gave no clue that could be followedup . In other words , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth . The corporal shook his head , said " This damned place is so full of jayhawkers , bushwhackers , and swine of all different kinds , they 'd steal our goddam boats if they was n't tied fast to the bank . " He posted a man to stand guard , said he 'd get the captain , told me dress if I wanted to , but there was really no need , " as give us a half hour , and we ought to be off your neck , with him outen the way too . " He was all ready to leave when suddenly , at the door , he turned to his other man , asked : " You see what I see , soldier ? " " Well Corporal , gim me some light . " " That hat , under the bed ! " " Brother ! "  |p159He  strode over , picked it up , and stared at the red pompon . " It 's him , " he whispered , " the one that killed Lieutenant Powell ! That 's what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw the man 's hat plain , it was one like the French Navy wears and had a red tassel on it ! " " That there 's a tuft , not a tassel . " " Whatever it is , it 's red . " " Corporal , you could be letting the Navy know . " " You bet I 'm letting the Navy know . " In so short a time that I barely had my clothes on , I was a bigger hero than I 'd ever been in my life , and I 've had my share of praise . The Navy got there : Ball , Sandy , and three ensigns from the Eastport ; a two-striper from the flag boat , and seamen from other boats . They piled in with a Captain Hager from the Provost Guard , the corporal , more privates , a stretcher , and so many bull's-eye lanterns the place was bright as day . They closed in on the corpse like staghounds , and all kowtowed to me as the one who had made the kill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who Pierre was , except that he 'd murderedPowell , and I certainly did n't enlighten them , though I avoided direct statements , one way or the other , by pretending " a bad reaction  --  do n't ask me to look at this man . " Hager , though , when he made me admit I was the one who had asked for a bodyguard earlier on in the evening , at once began boring in , but I told him : " That was just a precaution I felt I should take , from carrying a large sum of money , and had no connection with this that I know of , unless this fellow had heard rumors about me . " That seemed to satisfy him ; he even returned me my gun . " Obviously , " he said , " under the circumstances , in this godawful , lawless place , you may need it . "  |p160Then  he had the privates clean the room up , and Ball ordered the seamen to help . They found a pan and brooms in the kitchen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then brushed off the bed and made it up fresh . They did a bang-up policing job , and while it was going on , Sandy drew me into the hall . " Boy ! " he growled . " Did you fall into the cream pot ! " " ... Cream pot ? What are you talking about ? " " Your receipt ! We 'll have to sign it now ! " " Sandy ! I do n't have a receipt ! " " I know you do n't ! You do n't even have any cotton. , but this is your chance to get it ! Bill , do n't you see ? The Navy could n't refuse you now and still look you in the eye  --  and we would n't want to ! After all , we look out for our friends , and you 've just settled the hash of the killer we were looking for ! You get some cotton , Bill ! From your hombre if you can  --  the one holding the other half of your torn fifty-dollar bill ! But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up stock of your own , from whoever holds any titles to that cotton we took from the warehouse ! You 're the only one who can get a receipt , you got a monopoly , you 'll be the only bidder , they 'll have to take what you offer , you can get hold of that stock for a song ! Do n't you see , Bill ? Stop arguing with me ! Here I 've been racking my brains all night for some scheme you could pull to make that twenty-five thousand dollars , and now when it 's right in your hand , you stand there  --  " " I have n't said a goddam word . " " All right then , why do n't you say something ? " " I 'll think it over , I certainly will . " At last they went , carrying the corpse with them , and after I 'd closed the window and bolted the door , I startedp161back to bed . But for a moment I stood in the hall , trying to gather my wits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his deadly papers , and how to do it in time , before Pierre 's identification , when the cat would be out of the bag . And then , from above , came the whisper : " Willie , have they gone ? " " Thank God , they have . " " Get the ladder . I 'm coming down . " " Have you been up there all this time ? " " I held the skylight on a crack . " I got the ladder , and then she was sliding down through my arms , in nightie , slippers , robe , and beautiful smell . Then bare skin was on my hands , and time stood still as our mouths came together . I carried her into the bedroom , and nothing was there but the hunger we had for each other . Then she was up on one elbow , asking about the dead man . She said : " That was n't Burke they took out , it was Pierre . I saw him plain . " " I made a mistake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about ? " " Oh  --  cockeyed scheme he cooked up . " " I heard him say cotton . " " Yes , he did mention something about it . " " Willie , if I ever hear the end of that , that 's when I leap up and holler . And if you ever get yourself in it , that 's when I wring your neck . Now what was this scheme of his ? " I told her , not going into any details , and when I was done she said : " It 's out ! I never want to look at cotton again as long as I live . Do you hear me ? " " I do , and cotton does n't attract me . " " Because listen , Willie Cresap  --  " But I still had n't got to the main point , and I cut herp162off with a kiss , telling her : " Mignon Fournet , you listen to me ! " I said our time was short , and that I had to explain some things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I took it from the beginning  --  why I 'd left New Orleans , what Dan had said on the boat , what I 'd really meant when I came the day before , calling on her in the rain , what had gone through my mind when she told me their receipt had been signed . I told of my trip to the Eastport , and the fakedupstory I 'd told about the torn fifty-dollar bill . I told of my trip to the hotel , the answers I 'd got from Ball , and Burke 's sudden appearance . But when I mentioned the pass , she cut in quick : " But I never asked for a pass ! " " I figured that out , myself . " " But what was Frank thinking about ? " Her eyes , opening with disbelief , became two big black moons as I told about the receipt , how I was sure it was forged from the name on her pass , its connection with Powell 's murder , and what it would mean if found with Burke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was  --  " you 're tied in through the pass , and your father 's tied in through his articles of partnership . " And then , as an afterclap of the bitterness I 'd lived with so long : " Not that he does n't have it coming , after what he did , using you as bait  --  " " Using me as what ? " " You heard me ! As bait , to Burke . " " Oh , how wrong can anyone be ! " She said the bait was " the Pulaski cotton , the chance to buy it in a tremendous big cache on the Sabine River , that we had to dangle at Frank , to keep him from burning his papers just from pure spite . And where I came in , whyp163I had to be on Red River , was that I was the one who knew them , those people in Texas , those growers who hold the titles , through Raoul , before the war . " Of course , that corresponded with what Burke had said when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my horns quick , especially after hearing point-blank , out of her own mouth , that she had n't been close to Burke . But when she started going on with more about her father , I cut it off by asking : " Where is he , by the way ? I have to see him , and quick . " " I told you yesterday . He went for vension , to the Ransdell place back of town . But sometimes , when the Indian who brings in the deer is late , he has to stay overnight , and  --  " " When 'll he be back ? " " Wo n't be too long after sunup . " " Then I can see him in time  --  we hope . " " ... The dawn 's early light . I have to go . " " Hold on , Mignon , not so fast  --  let 's get back to Powell and why he was killed . If you do n't believe it 's true , my notion about that pass  --  " " Willie , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the graying dark started putting on the robe . She said : " And I know what has to be done . So if my father , with Pierre out of the way , does n't go to Frank with a gun , take that receipt and burn it , along with every title to every bale of cotton we ever thought was ours , you know who 's going to do it ? " " I am . " " No , Willie . I am. "  |p164SHE  LET ME IN in a red-checked gingham dress , the first time I 'd ever seen her wearing anything but black . It was just a morning dress , but went with her color somehow , and she seemed pleased when I said how well it became her . Then she brought me into a flat that was the duplicate , in reverse , of the one I was living in , and yet was as different from it as day is from night . In place of the coconutmatting , the halls had Axminster runners ; in place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies and dogs ; in place of the Sunday-School smell was her smell , the smell of books , and the smell of ham frying ; in place of the Prussian kings in the sitting room were books  --  hundreds of them , in shelves as high as your head almost covering the wall . On top , stuck around every which way , were all kinds of pictures and stuff , from photographs of her as a child to old dance programs , filled out . The fur/niture was old-fashioned , but nicely upholstered in tapestry . At one side was a Steinway grand , at the other a long table , with an iron stand on it , supporting a wash-boiler , with a muslin skirt on it and a spirit lamp underneath , taking the chill off . When I asked who played , she sat down and clatteredthe keys , saying : " That 's Mozart  --  Father loves Don Giovanni . " But then : " I have to watch my meat , " and I followed her back to the kitchen . It was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and canisters . She had a fire going , and in a skillet pieces of ham that she speared with a fork and turned over . She seemed proud of how she could cook , explaining : " I learned it in the convent at Grand Coteau . We were studying to be ladies , but when the war began to come on , the Reverend Mother insisted we study to be cooks . " She gave me breakfast in the dining room : stewed prunes , ham , eggs , and hominy ; when I marveled at the menu , how good it was in a place overrun by the war , she said : " Do n't forget , Father keeps store . He knows where stuff is , and how to get it in . " But as I finished my coffee she held up her hand . " That 's Father , " she said . We went into the pantry ; she drew the bolts of the trapdoor , I gripped it by the holes and raised it . Mr. Landry came up , dressed roughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed a shave and was thinner , but for some reason he seemed younger than I remembered him  --  it could have been the way he handled the deer . Once again , I noted how strong he must be . When he saw me , he shook hands , very quiet  --  not surprised , not upset , and not glad . I said I had business with him , and he said : " Very well , sir  --  I 'll be with you as soon as I take this carcass apart and get it down in the cistern ,  |p166where  it 'll be cool . " When I told him there was n't time for that , he looked at me sharply , dumped the meat on the kitchen table , sat in the chair beside it , and waited . I gave it to him quick , everything he needed to know , down to my killing of Pierre . I said : " They 'll identify him , sure . When they do they 'll go to Burke  --  they 'll question him , they 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mignon is , for the reason  --  " " I can see the reason , please . " " Where does Burke live ? " He pointed beyond the back fence to a brick house facing Second Street , cater-cornered across from the market Burke had mentioned , now all , shuttered up . I asked : " Can you go in the back way ? " " I have the key , as Frank has to my store . " " Then , you have to move fast , or else  --  " " I know I have to move fast ! " He shriveled me with his tone , then sat there , not lookingyoung any more but horribly old . He passed a hand over his face , then said : " So . " And then , after some moments : " Here I am , at the end of the line . " " That 's right , " I said , my old bitterness speaking once more . " After chasing that will-o ' - the- wisp , that pot of gold you thought was under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river and down the lake , here you are , right where you started from , with every bale of that cotton lost  --  because once you burn that receipt , the rest of it 's nothing but paper . It 's what you get , my friend , for hooking up with that skunk , the one who turned on you for the sake of making some tin . There 're other things , occasionally , more important than tin . " " Sir , by what right do you censure me ? "  | " The right of a man who would n't be here if it had n't been for you . When you brought Mignon , I had to come too  --  I hated it , I tried to shuffle it off , to pretend there was no need . But here I am , and I 'm telling you , if it was n't for what you did , we 'd all three be in New Orleans , she and I would be married , and life would go on . Instead of which , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gallows ' shadow , and  --  " " It may not be so simple as that . " " It 's exactly as simple as that . " " That cotton was made over to me by people in desperateneed , people I 'd helped in one way or another . They 're proud , and it was their way of paying . But they 're still in desperate need , and if there was any way I could cash in , so perhaps they could share " Oh my , listen at Santa Claus ! " " I did share , as you yourself can tell . " " And when was this noble deed ? " " I bought those boys shoes . You defended me for it . " " ... I 'm sorry . I forgot . " " What else could I do for these people ? " " Fight for their country , maybe  --  and yours . " " I 'm sorry , that 's impossible . " " I hear different , Mr. Landry  --  very different . " " Our country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taylor 's fighting for Louisiana . " " Taylor 's a fool . I look down on , I despise him , any man that asks boys to die for a cause already lost ! I do n't call that patriotism , I just call it dumbness ! But if , by using a trick , I do n't care how crooked , I can break out of this hell we 're in , this half-war they 've inflicted upon us where they wo n't let us fight and wo n't give us peace , I can getp168some of their tin , to divide up with my long-suffering people , I 'll do it , I do n't care who I have to hook up with . So it 's Burke , and he turned on me , you tell me . So he did , and I 'd kill him , give me the chance . But did he , any worse than the rest ? Which of them did n't turn  --  on me , on all of us here ? I 'd kill ' em all ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not Willie , Father ! " She stood there in front of him , and he swallowed once , then said : " All right , not Willie . " " He saved you , do n't forget . " " . . . How 's Miss Tremaine ? " he asked me . " But when I opened my mouth to answer , she closed it with her hand . " Are you going ? " she asked him . " Of course I 'm going . I have to . " But he still sat there , apparently gathering his courage , and she said I should cut up the meat . She got a knife , steel , and cleaver from a drawer , and told me : " First you take off the haunch , then the loin , then the foreleg , then the neck , then the chuck , which leaves the rib in one piece  --  then it 'll all fit in the tub . But first , before anything else , take off the shanks  --  I can use them tonight for soup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he suddenly pointed outside , and that ended the meat for a while . On Second Street , up by the market , Burke was coming down , walking slow , peering around . " He 's looking for Pierre ! " whispered Mr. Landry . " He must not have heard he 's dead ! " As the three of us stood by the window , Burke reached the corner , which he had all to himself at this hour , looked in all four directions , and kept on . He disappeared beyond his house , but in a few seconds popped out from the back door into the yard . Then , after snooping into the outhouses , he ducked throughp169the gates in the fences , headed for our back door . " He 'll come in with his key , " she said to her father . " You talk , and talk right  --  have him come up , and do n't give any sign . " To me she whispered : " You cover him . " By then she 'd seen the gun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under my coat . I drew it , and took position with her just by the kitchen door . Mr. Landry went to the pantry and called . It had its own partition , but was really a continuation of the hall , and the kitchen door was alongside . Burke answered , and we heard him come up the stairs , heard the trap close as Mr. Landry lowered it to cut off retreat . We looked at each other as Burke said : " Adolphe , I 'm scared to death  --  Pierre 's not in the house , has n't been in all night . And  --  did you know ?  --  Cresap 's in town ! And I heard shots in the night ! And with Pierre detesting 'm so , it could mean , God forbid  --  " " Real trouble , could n't it ? " I stepped out , chocking the gun in his ribs , slapping him up quick , and taking a Colt Navy gun that he had in one coat pocket . I handed it to her , motioned him into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the chair Mr. Landry had used . I told him put down his hands . " We have some talking to do . And just to start it off friendly , cast it out of your mind , all worry about Pierre Legrand . He 's dead . " " ... You lie . " " No . I killed him . After he tried to kill me . Who told him to , I do n't know  --  but shooting a man asleep is a dirty Irish trick no Frenchman would ever think of . " " Where is he ? " " I do n't know . Ask the Provost Guard . " " And what do you want of me ? "  | " As to that , I 'll let Mr. Landry say . " " Adolphe ! Do n't tell me you 're in with this thug ? " " Frank , there 's things I have to ask you . " " But your home , that you bade me come to , that you invited me into just now , no more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good faith  --  where 's the sanctity oft ? " " That bothers me , I own that up . But this is life and death . Frank , what about that receipt , the one the Navy gave you , for this cotton I made over to you ? " " Well what about't ? I have't ! " " Mr. Cresap thinks you forged the signature . " " I forged't ? Is the fellow daft on this subject ? " " What about that pass for Mignon ? " " Well ! ' T was to be a pleasant surprise , and ... " " Pleasant ? A trip to her mother 's grave ? And who gave you leave , Frank , to mess into it ? " Burke 's gall in daringto use this sacred thing seemed to infuriate him more than all the rest put together , and I had to remind him it had nothing to do with the case . He hardly seemed to hear me , but he did get off the subject . " And you had Pierre kill Powell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merciless driving at Burke . " But Adolphe , how could you think such a thing ? " " The Navy saw him , that 's how ! " " They saw  --  Pierre ? " Mr. Landry wheeled , said " Tell him , Mr. Cresap , what the boys said in your flat ! " I repeated about the red pompon , but Burke , even when hit with the truth , would keep on screaming " Lie ! "  --  and that 's what he did now . However , we 'd got to the meat of the matter , and time was going on . I said : " Burke , put your keys on the table . " " I have a key , " said Mr. Landry . " To his back door . "  | " He may have a lockbox or something . " And to Burke again : " Put ' em out ! " He obeyed , pretty quick , pitching a ring on the table , with quite a few keys on it , of assorted sizes . I reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun , hooking it with my little finger to pull it to me . By then , my stick was secondnature , and I hardly thought about it as my other hand held it , supporting my weight . But the sneaky Irishman did . He twitched it with his feet , just a little , but that was enough . He shot it out from under me , and as I lost balance and fell , he smashed one hand at my gun , the other at her face , so she fell and his gun flew out of her hand . He grabbed it and leveled both guns . " Stay where you are , " he commanded , " and listen to me , the three of you ! " Then he started in , as Landry stood where he was and she and I lay on the floor , pouring out what he felt . It quickly became clear that we were n't the only ones with pent-up ugly feelings . It was shocking , the language he used , not only to her and her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swore he was going to kill me , and I had a horrible feeling he meant it . But pretty soon Mr. Landry broke in : " Quit it , Frank , quit it ! " " I repeat every word I 've said ! " " You want to hang ? Because that 's what you 'll do , that 's what we all will do , unless I get that receipt before the Navy gets it . " He held up his hand at Burke , slipped his hands under Mignon 's arms , lifted her to her feet and kissed her . Then he started for me , to help me up . But , as though doing first things first , he turned to hand me the stick that still lay on the floor . The rest was all one motion . He picked it up by the small end and swung it in an arc as a batter swings ap172bat , so hard it whined through the air . The crack was sharp , and Burke fell like a pole-axed steer , toppling from his chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Moore &; Pond into the holster , handing the other to Mr. Landry . He took it but without paying attention , as he was staring down at Burke with a wild , venomous look . She was staring too , but at him , as though he was something holy . I guess I stared too , and maybe mumbled my thanks for the quickwittedthing he had done . Then at last he looked up , patted the Colt , and took the keys . He said : " I want him  --  left where he is , till I dispose of him later . While I 'm searching that house  --  get this meat cut up  --  put it down , out of sight . If somebody comes  --  let them in  --  act natural  --  talk . If they 're looking for him  --  all you know is  --  he was due to leave  --  for Shreveport . Tell them nothing  --  above all , do n't bring them back here . " " Yes , " she said . " Right , " I agreed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He went , down through the store , through the gates in the fences , and in through Burke 's back door.  |p173SHE  SCRAMBLED DOWN and spread newspapers out on thefloor at the foot of the stairs , directly below the trapdoor . Then she came back , standing by as I hacked at the meat , taking each piece as I got it off and dropping it down on the paper . It was a new kind of job to me and made me pretty sick , though whether it was the bloody meat that got me or the sight of Burke on the floor , I ca n't rightly say  --  maybe a little of both . But before very long I was done , and as soon as I wiped off the table and washed up the tools and myself , I went down with her to the locked-up store , with its empty shelves , musty smell , and cobwebs . The meat had to go in a tub , which was already down in the old cistern , but to reach it boards had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron . The cistern was dry enough , but the bottom was covered with duckboards , and the tub sat on them . It was half full of other meat , including a pickedp174chicken she said we would have for dinner . I handed it up and she passed the venison down . I put it in with the other meat , replaced all the boards , and followed her upstairs . She was a few seconds ahead of me , and when I got to the kitchen , she was standing face to the wall , her head on her arms . When I asked what the trouble was , she pointed to Burke and said : " Willie , I was glad at him being dead  --  I was proud of Father for hitting him . But he 's not dead ! He 's breathing ! " I listened , and he certainly was , with a rattle in his throat , his face a purplish red . I said : " He wo n't be for long , I imagine . " " Willie ! I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So what do I do ? Shoot him ? " " No ! " Then : " He 's getting a knot on his head ! " " Well he was cracked on the conk , you know . " " But it shows ! It proves how long we left him lay ! " " ... I guess that 's not so good . " " It knocks in the head any story we tell  --  about its being self-defense , or anything of that kind . Willie , if he dies or he does n't die , there 's that knot to prove that what we say is not true ! Because if it was self-defense , why did n't we give one yelp for help when we needed help ? Why did we let all that time go by while that knot was swelling up ? And if it was not self-defense , what was it ? " " Take it easy . Let 's figure on it . " To tell the truth , I was beginning to be just as scared as she was , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought they were going to be . While we were cutting the meat to get it out of the way and have the place shipshape , I 'd been putting first things first and postponing everything else until Mr. Landry 's return , when I supposed he 'd takep175the lead -- it was his responsibility , he had swung the stick . But that was on the assumption he would only be a few minutes , and once the papers were burned we could decide what to say , with our corpse still not cold . But here it was almost an hour , and instead of a corpse there was Burke on the floor , not even really alive . What to do about him I was too panicked to think . I may as well own up I was tempted to settle his hash , give him a tap with the peen of a hatchet that was on top of the woodbox . But I did n't quite have the nerve . All of a sudden she pointed , and there was Mr. Landry , coming through the gates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering the store , he raced to the Schmidt place , and then from under my flat we heard metal banging . Then there he was back in the yard , carrying a tremendous can , one I 'd seen through the window , in among the sugar-mill stuff . He opened the door below , and we heard the can banging , down at the foot of the stairs . Then he was climbing up through the trapdoor , his face white , his eyes bright the way hers were sometimes , with a wild , fanatical shine . He said : " Sorry , Mignon ; sorry , Bill , to be so long , but I was forever finding that tin box he had to keep his papers in . It was inside the square piano ! However , it may have been just as well , as it gave me time to think what to do with him . He 's going in a can I borrowed from Friedrich Schmidt  --  we wire the top on , load it on the dolly , roll it across Front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of their eyes , now , in broad daylight ! " " We 're not ! " she said . " No such ! " " Daughter , we dare not report this death . " " He 's not dead ! "  | " ... What ? " " All right , go look for yourself ! " He looked , listened to Burke 's breathing , and sat down at the table . " This complicates things , " he said . His eyes lost their shine , and I could see him doing what I did : lose his nerve and fall apart at the change from high excitement to dull , stupid danger that was n't the less dangerous from being halfway under the gate , and stuck there . He licked his lips , and then pretty soon looked up . " At least , " he said , " I 've brought the can in  --  it 's down there , in the store . When it happens , we 'll have it ready . " To that nobodysaid anything , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did n't enthuse at all to that we he 'd got off so glibly . After some minutes , he pulled himself together a little , took the papers out of his pocket  --  some on legal-cap , tied at the top with tape that had wax seals on the knots , some on printed forms with RACHAL 'S at the top , some just plain foolscap with columns of letters and numbers . He said : " At least , we can get these out of the way , so we can breathe safely , " and started for the stove , where some embers were still glowing . I watched him lift the lid , then suddenly bellowed : " Hold it ! " I stumped over , snatched the papers from his hand . " Mr. Cresap , " he said , very peevishly " you were theone who insisted this stuff must be burned ! Here it is , justas you said , the forged Navy receipt , with the signaturetraced on , identical with the one signed to the pass , thatthing he got for Mignon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass , the mirror for reflecting light  --  the thingis completely damning . What 's the matter now ? Why didyou grab those papers ? Why should n't they be destroyed ? "  | " Suppose it does n't happen ? " " You mean , suppose he does n't die ? " " Yes  --  for the hell of it , just suppose . " " Well all the more reason , I 'd think  --  " " Think again , Mr. Landry . Found by a party searchingBurke 's house , that stuff could hang you  --  and probably hang Mignon  --  as accessories to Powell 's murder ; they 'd tie you in , close enough . But found , by you , and duly presented to them , it would be your exoneration  --  not only of any connection with Powell , but for this fracas today , as well ! When I came in just now , with news of last night 's shooting and with what I 'd been told by Ball up at the hotel earlier , you began to have your suspicions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did n't answer , but tried to shoot you , and when he pulled his gun , you smashed him with the stick . Then you took his keys , went over , and made your search . You think it clears everything up  --  and they 'll have to think so too . It 'll take care of what worries Mignon , why we let time go by , without even calling a doctor . To you , I think you can say , it seemed more important to check this evidence over , though it might take a while , than to worry too much about a skunk who was n't worth saving anyhow . " " Thank God ! " she said . " Willie has the answer ! "  --  . . . Bill , you could be right .  --  We went over it two or three times , to have it clear and straight , especially about Pierre and how we 'd bring him in . Because it was all right the night before for me not to recognize him , as no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but now for Mr. Landry not to have a suspicion when I told of the shooting would have a fishyp178look . We decided suspicion was really the key , that for him it was one more thing he wanted Burke to explain , but not something he was sure of to the extent he 'd have to reportwhat he thought . That way he would n't look dumb , and at the same time he 'd be in the position a sensible man would take , of hesitating quite a while before shooting off his mouth with charges he could n't prove . All that seemed rock-ribbed enough , especially since Burke could not contradict  --  we'dassumed , for some reason , that he was due to die , if not there in the kitchen with us , then later somewhere , in custody . So with things pretty well settled , I put the papers away in the grand piano , there in the sitting room , taking a tip from Burke . When I went back to the kitchen , it was all in the soup , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to groan . The three of us looked at each other , then looked away in consternation . " He 's coming to , " said Mignon . " . . . What now ? " her father groaned . " By me , " I said . " I 'm stumped . " However , I was n't too stumped to give Burke a kick , a hard one , right in the rump , and he let out a muffled yell . Then he sat up . Then , dragging himself to a spot near the wall , where he could lean his head against it , he touched his knot with one hand , while he leaned on the other and cussed . He called me scut , crud , and dirty- son of a bitch . He called Mr. Landry a Judas . He called her whore , drab , queen of the swampland strumpets . He called on the Holy Mother of God to be his witness what a fine hombre he was , and told all the good he 'd done , from Nicaragua to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Limerick . He kept it up for some time , until I began wondering why any of us had to listen . I went over and gave him another kick . Hep179shut up and lay there panting . And then suddenly , from over on Second Street somewhere , I heard : " Column , halt ! " I looked , and in front of Burke 's house the whole bunch had halted  --  Hager , Dan , Sandy , Ball , four or five Navy ensigns , some seamen , and a detail from the Provost Guard . I heard my mouth say to Burke : " Skunk , they 've identified their corpse , and they 're looking for you at your house . They 'll be here , and listen what I 'm telling you : We have all that cotton stuff , including the forged receipt . Mr. Landry found it , in your square piano . It can hang you , do you hear ? " " What are you getting at , scut ? " " We can show them that receipt . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be damned to you ! " " We prefer not . We 'd enjoy seeing you hang , but the thing could ramify against these two wonderful people that you 've got into this mess  --  especially if you dragged them in , trying to save yourself . So we 're not showing it to them ! At least , not yet . To get the curtain down , to close the case , to hush up the real truth , we 're giving you your chance to tell it your own way . So when they come , see that you talk right . " " Tell him , " wailed Mr. Landry , " what he 's to say ! " " Well , what is he to say ? " I asked . " We  --  have to think of something , now ! " " I 've completely run out of think . And besides , " I went on , somewhat annoyed , " who the hell are we to be teaching a liar how to cook up a lie ? " " Here they come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I looked out the window , here came the column of twos , Dan and Hager in front , marching down the side street.  |p180BuT  No oNE CAME to the door , and it was n't until a knock sounded on the other side of the building that I realized that Burke , the last he 'd been seen by the guard , was being ordered by me to report to my flat in the morning . So I went down and around to answer . Hager was up on the stoop , with Dan , Ball , and Sandy , banging to get in , the rest down below , standing around in the alley . I spoke , and when they said they were looking for Burke , I explained where he was and said : " We 're having our talk over there . " Then Dan said : " Good morning , Bill , " and said he 'd been detailed " to sit in as Headquarters observer , on this shooting thing , whatever it amounts to . " I said a dead man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that I 'd give any help that I could , if more information was wanted . Then I led the way around , and Mignon opened the door . I introduced Hager and Ball , reminding her :  | " You know Captain Dan Dorsey , and also , I think , LieutenantGregg . " Sandy stared when he saw her , but took her hand when she gave it , and called her Mrs. Fournet . Then Burke appeared behind her , but balked when Hager told him he was wanted at the courthouse for questioning . " I 'm not feeling too well , " he said . " I do n't care for marchingabout . " " And what seems to be the trouble ? " asked Hager . " The wallop I took on my head . " He pointed at the knot , and while Hager was peeringat it , said : " I was out , looking for me gippo , and bangedme head at the market on the awning over a stall . " " It 's your gippo that brings us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain . " " He 's dead . " " Aye . " Adolphe Landry got in it then , appearing beside Mignonand asking everyone in . The ensigns and enlisted men were told to stand by below , while Hager , Dan , Ball , and Sandy came in . Hager camped on the sitting-room settee , looking much like a judge , while Mignon , Dan , Ball , and Burke occupied the chairs , and Adolphe , Sandy , and I stood , our backs to one of the bookshelves . Hager got at it immediately , saying : " Mr. Burke , a man was killed last night , in the flat next door , by Mr. Cresap here , identified as Pierre Legrand , your personal servant or , as you call him , your gippo . What do you know about it ? " " Nothing , of course , Captain . " " Did you know he tried to kill Cresap ? " " Not until Cresap mentioned it . " " That your man shot at him ? " " That someone did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p182That  covered , in a way I had to admire , my failure to identify Pierre , so nothing had been joggled in a way I would have to explain . But I put in , on my own , that I 'd only seen this Pierre once , for the barest glance , in New Orleans , and would n't have known him from Adam . Burke asked : " Who made the identification , if I may make so bold as to inquire ? " Hager told him : " Two sutlers and a cook at the Ice House Hotel . " Burke nodded and said : " That explains't  --  Pierrealways bought our food . " Then Hager got back to the point , and asked Burke very sharp : " Did you send this man to kill Cresap ? " " God forbid ! Why should I ? " " Did you send him to kill Powell ? " " No . . . . You think he killed Powell ? " " We know he killed Powell . " Hager was murderously cold , and walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at him , hard . But Burke was strangely unfussed . " I may say it does n't surprise me , " he said in a quiet way , as if hearing gossip of an interesting kind . " ... Why not ? " asked Hager , caught off balance . " The bad blood between ' em , " said Burke . " Bad blood ? Between Powell ? And  --  this man ? " " I do n't care for that remark , " roared Burke , with a snarl . " It seems to imply , Captain , that as between a fine gentleman such as Powell and a midge such as Pierre , bad blood could n't exist , as the officer would n't deign and the varlet would n't dare . Know then , the gentleman did deign , in a vulgar , ungentlemanly way , and the varlet did dare , in a way even you might respect . He had his pride , he was a man . " " And when was all this , Burke ? " " Last summer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bagdad , Mexico . " Hager , whose reaction to surprise had been to rip at Burke , was now set back on his heels even worse than before , and to cover up , pretended disgust . Returning to his place on the settee , he said in a lofty- way : " Let 's get back to Cresap . " " Let 's not , " said Burke . Then he got up and went over , so he could stare down at Hager . " At the Hotel DeGlobe in Bagdad , " he rumbled slowly , " Pierre had got 'm a job , after his discharge from the Berthollet , serving drinks in the bar . And there every night came Powell . He was on the Itasca then , the steam schooner on blockade duty , and would come ashore at night , to inquireabout cotton shipments  --  and to drink . To swill booze , carouse , and quarrel with Pierre in the bar , holding the boy up to ridicule , taunting 'm , plaguing 'm , mocking 'm . It got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took a hand with Pierre , and brought 'm to Matamoros by diligencia one day . And then , in me growing affection for 'm , I hired 'm on as boy , as valet , as gippo . " His voice had risen a little , and he turned suddenly on Ball . " Am I right , Lieutenant ? " he asked . " Is n't it true ? Every word that I 've said ? " " I 've never been to Mexico . " " You 've been to the Ice House Hotel -- you followed Powell on that duty , right here in Alexandria . How did he conduct himself in that bar ? " " In exemplary fashion , sir . " " Then he reformed himself , I may say . " How much of it was true , I did n't of course know , though some of it had to be , especially the Itasca part , or Ball would have contradicted . But true or false , it was ap184mile away from himself and any motive he might have had for ordering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I had to be on his side , as I had sicked him on . He smelled advantage , and in a reasonable tone resumed : " Or in other words , Captain  --  " " Never mind the other words , " snapped Hager . " Let 's get back to you . Why , in the light of all that , did n't you once open your mouth when Lieutenant Powell was killed ? " " I ? Inform on me own gippo ? " " If you knew he 'd committed a crime ? " " Captain ! I did n't know it ! " " Do n't quibble ! You knew about the grudge ! " " I knew of twenty thousand grudges . " " ... What do you mean by that ? " " Your own among the rest ! " " My grudge , Burke ? My grudge ? " " Aye  --  you bore 'm a grudge , you bear 'm a grudge as you sit there , as this whole Army does , against the MississippiSquadron of the United States Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hate the Navy 's guts , so do n't single me out for failing to open me mouth on a matter that could have involved every man in this town  --  except the boys afloat ! Who did n't bear 'm a grudge ? Tell me who did n't , and I 'll tell him , not you , why I did n't speak up ! " Clammy silence settled down , and it was some moments before Hager asked : " Why would this man try to kill Cresap ? " " I do n't know , he did n't discuss't with me . " " What would be your conjecture ? " " Why do n't you ask Cresap ? " " We did . He did n't know . I 'm asking you . " " Why would n't he try to kill Cresap ? A man whop185blackened his character , did infamous things to him , only last month in New Orleans ? Who attempted to make it appear the boy deserted his post in my rooms at the City Hotel , so a pretended search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that I manufactured against a friend and mentor and partner , who sits here in front of your eyes , Adolphe Landry , no other , and who can throw the lie in me teeth , if I wander one inch from the truth ! When all the time ' t was himself , this same clever Cresap , who forged the documents up , in the hope of discrediting me , and in that way enriching himself ! " He came over and smiled in my face , so I knew what to expect , if the forged receipt came out  --  by hook , crook , or trick , it would be hung on me . He turned to Hager again and went on , very pious : " Pierre was plain , rude , and ignorant , and no doubt given to violence , as such boys usually are . But false to a duty he was not  --  he never deserted a post ! And perhaps he brooded a bit at me own troubled spirit , when I returned to the house last night . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hager was quite sarcastic , but did n't ask about New Orleans , which told me he knew what had happened there , and if it told me it told Burke , he not being dumb on such things . " His rapacious demands , " he answered . " Cresap 's , you mean ? " " For 's fee . " " What fee ? " " That I promised 'm , two hundred and fifty dollars . To free Adolphe . " " Well ? He freed him , did n't he ? " " Aye , but look what he did to me ! Got me accused , unjustly , so I spent a night confined , as a common thug , inp186a cell ! I refused to pay 'm a cent , and last night he renewed his demands  --  Lieutenant Ball will bear witness for me , how he called me aside in the hotel , wanting payment , and your guard will corroborate that he ordered me , on the street , to report here today , else bear the consequence  --  he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He questioned me passes , Captain . " It all matched up , it did n't sound collusive , and it concealedreal motive . It was a masterly job of lying , and I had to get in step . When Hager turned to me , I said : " I doubted , and still doubt , if this man has proper permission to be here  --  he came when the Reb Army was here , and a Reb permit is n't valid , it means nothing to a Union marshal . However , that 's not for me to decide . As to what he says in general , allowing for distortion , self-pity , and overpraise of the gentle Pierre , I would say he 's pretty well covered the ground . Now that I know who I killed , I admit he had grounds to dislike me . " " The passes , Burke ? Let 's see them . " Burke got them out , from the same old stuffed-up wallet  --  letters , from prominent Rebs in New Orleans , that he 'd used on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; stuff concerning Pierre , including his French discharge ; and a U.S. custom-house permit for the importation of cotton , covering , Burke said , " right of access to me property "  --  meaning , his presence in Alexandria . While Hager was reading them over , small things happened . Ball , who had snickered at " the gentle Pierre , " looked over and threw me a wink . Sandy leaned close and whispered : " This Mignon package  --  you like her ? " " Yes , I guess so , " I whispered back . " I was hoping to lift her skirt . " p 187 " 1 hope to make her my wife . " " Ouch  --  I did n't say it ; you misunderstood me ! " And then , for a real fast switch : " Bill , did you notice Ball ? How friendly he 's acting toward you ? You 're still hot ! " " So ? What then ? " " You can still get that receipt ! " " For what ? " " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any cotton ! " " Goddam it , get some ! " Next off , Hager , Ball , and Dan had their heads together , and just once Dan shrugged . Then Hager reached out and handed Burke back his papers . It was over , with the officers marching out after saluting Mignon and thanking Mr. Landry for his kindness in asking them in . Then there we were , Mr. Landry , Burke , Mignon , and I , drawing trembling breaths . And then : " Frank , " said Mr. Landry , " I could n't ever forget what you did just now , in the way of what could be called , I suppose , convenient prevarication . And I hope I never forget the horrible reason for it . " " The horrible reason , " I told him , " was that knowing a skunk for a skunk , you still partnered with him  --  for the money . So if you do n't like how he smells , you may smell the same way , yourself . " " Willie , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sometimes , " I said , " orneriness clears the air . " " And well the air needs't , " Burke flung at me with asneer . " As the author of the idea , you smell a bit yourself . " " Perhaps , " I agreed . " No doubt . " " But in a wholesome , mephitic way ! " " Damn it , I owned up to it , did n't I ? " I sounded hysterical , and slammed out of there.  |p188IN  MY FLAT , I had a bad reaction and lay down for a while to think . It was going on noon , and I 'd decided to visit the hotel for lunch when a tap came on the door , and I got up to let her in . She had a platter of ham , cornbread , and lentils , all warmed up very nice and covered with a napkin , and a pail of hot coffee . She served us in the dining room , using Schmidt dishes , and as we ate she talked , mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as his head did n't hurt , for the Sabine to buy in the cotton . She said she 'd written a letter for him , addressed to people out there , giving him a " character , " and that her father had written him one , addressed to Kirby Smith , the Reb commander in chief , " as of course that whole country is still in the Secesh lines . " She talked of various things , as though nothing had happened at all , and I found myself wondering if anything really had . She made me eat up every speck , sop189she could wash the things in cold water , and then when she 'd put them away , led on up the hall . But instead of turning off to go out , she kept on to the sitting room and , though I took a seat , kept on marching around , restless . I said again how pretty she looked in the gingham , and she said : " I like red  --  and it likes me , I think . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What was Sandy saying to you ? " " Why , " I said , " he wanted to know if I liked you . He let drop he 'd been hoping to lift your skirt . " " Well he tried ! Did he let drop about that ? " " No , and you did n't either . " " Well ? In one of the fitting rooms , there at Lavadeau 's , he commenced messing around . It did n't amount to much . " " Just practically nothing at all ? " " ... What else did he have to say ? " " Nothing . Just this , that , and the other . " " He was nagging at you about something . What ? " " ... I do n't just now recollect . " " It was the cotton , was n't it ? What he spoke about before , this morning there in the hall . And how you could get a receipt , after killing Powell 's murderer . That 's what it was , is n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any cotton . " " Yes , but we have . " " Who is we ? " " Father and I , Willie . " " Did Mr. Landry send you to me ? " " No , certainly not  --  he 's over at Frank 's , packing him up to leave , trying to get him started , he wants him out of the way . And Frank 's going  --  he thinks , now that that forgery did n't work , those titles he had are worthless , so thep190cotton on the Sabine is all that 's left for him . He does n't know what we know , that you can get a receipt , that the Navy will give you one . So all we have to do is tear up the papers in his name and copy new ones off , in the name of Willie Cresap . And then , lo and behold , it 's a hundred and twenty thousand dollars ! " " Mignon , I 'm sick of this cotton . " " Well , was n't I ? Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes you change ? " " You , that 's what . So long as Frank was in it , I was scared to death . I learned to fear him as I 'd never feared anyone . But you , Willie , are honest . " " Dan says this cotton is hoodooed . " " Hoodoo was n't the trouble . Crookedness was . " " Whatever it was , I 'm still sick of it . " " What about the twenty-five thousand dollars ? " " ... It 's what Sandy 's worrying about . " " You still have to get it , Willie . " " I do n't care to get it that way . " " But you do care to get it from her ? " She had nestled into my lap , but now got up and faced me , and when I just sat there and stared , caught utterly by surprise , she charged back into the dining room , then came up the hall with her platter in one hand and her little tin pail in the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she banged me with the pail , so it flew out of her hands and clattered to the floor . To keep it from getting broken , I took the platter away from her , then took her by the wrist and dragged her into the bedroom . When I 'd flung her on the bed , I said : " Calm down for a change , why do n't you ? What 's the idea , flying off the handle this way ? " " You can get other things from her , too ! "  | " Well , I never did , but  --  " " You never did ! Well , you 've been missing something , that 's all I have to say . Because she 's willing , that I promise you ! " " So happens , was the other way around . " " You asked and she said no ? " " That was it , exactly . " " Why ? What made her act so noble ? " " Whiff of Russian Leather . " Some things have the ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eye that she knew this was one of them . She stared up at the ceiling , and her mouth began to twist . I 'm sure that of all the things that happened to her that day , none meant to her quite what those four little words had said . Some little time went by as she lay there , trying not to cry , her dress rumpled , her white petticoat flared out , her pantalettes hiked up , her beautiful legs showing as far as the garters . I put the platter down , set the pail beside it , and went over to her . I undid tapes and buttons , and she did n't seem to help , but did n't stop me either , and pretty soon there she was , without a stitch on . Only then did she whisper : " My favorite costume , it seems . " " And very becoming , too . " " Willie , stop trying to switch . " " I 'm not . I guess Burke called it on me  --  I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might as well make it pay . How long will this write-up take ? " " Couple of days , no more . " " The Eastport could be gone by then with the rest of the invasion  --  headed for Shreveport . Upriver . " " No , Willie . Great big boat like her ca n't get up the falls in a hurry  --  she has to be drug . They learned theirp192lesson from another one , the Woodford , that they got carelesswith . She 's sitting on bottom right now up at the head of the falls , a hole punched in her hull . This boat will take some days , and in that time we 'll do our writing  --  I 'll help with it . What takes the time is the bale markings . Cotton 's not like corn , which is so many bushels and one bushel 's just like another . With cotton , it must be this particular bale , and every one has to be listed , by mark , number , and weight . And that list goes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bill of sale from Father , conveying the cotton to you , which is the proof you give the Navy that the cotton belongs to you , a loyal godpappy . That should be ready tomorrow , for recording down in the courthouse . Then the receipt itself , which you can take to the Navy on Sunday , I would expect . Then the partnership articles , they can be written up last , as there 's no hurry about them . You really mean to , Willie ? " " If your father 's agreeable , I am . " " Kiss me then , nice . " Not that Mr. Landry , when she told him in their sitting room later that afternoon , exactly jumped up and cracked his heels . He was bitter against me for telling him that he stank , and full of justification for the relations he 'd had with Burke . " I deny it was my fault ! " he speechified at me , walking up and down . " I deny it was anyone 's fault , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell-on-earth they 've put on us ! War 's over in Louisiana  --  but do they give us peace ? No ! They keep tramping us down with this halfwar , half-peace they bring with them , worse than that lifein-deathof the Ancient Mariner , neither one thing nor the other ! And if I did what I had to , to give , to help othersp193live , I do n't apologize , and I wo n't have it I stink ! All right , Frank 's a skunk  --  I was the first to say it , and I tried to kill him for it ! But I used him , he did n't use me ! And I had my decent reasons ! It was the only way open to me to get back at this bluebelly bunch , to get a chunk of their tin , to make them pay through the nose for what they 've done to me , and what they 've done to mine ! Because , at least I meant to share a little , if any profits accrued , with these people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most ! " " This I find most astonishing . " " I 've already shared with these people  --  I bought them shoes , and you defended me for it . Did n't you ? " " . . . Yes . I retract . " I 'd been hoping , I guess , that by plaguing him , even though I owed him my life , I 'd force him to reject me as a partner and I 'd be out from under . But when I said : " If you do n't want this deal , just say so , " he wheeled on me quick and answered : " I did n't say that , Mr. Cresap . I would assume , however , that first before anything else , you 'd want to be assured you 're not hooking up with a skunk . " " Then , you 're not a skunk , " I said . " You two could shake hands , " she told us . Down in the store was an office partitioned off in one corner , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelves piled up with ledgers . Landry worked there the rest of the day , and by candlelight into the night , getting the bill of sale up , making it correspond with the markings on the papers I 'd stuffed in the piano . Next day he signed it over and took me down with it to the courthouse , where we went past Hager 's desk to the Clerk of Court 's office and had it recorded . Then , with Mignon right beside him call/ing the data off , he wrote up the Navy receipt , and next day I took it to Sandy . I found him on his boat , which was celebrating Easter Sunday by battling her way up the falls . The falls was really a rapid a mile or so long above town , and no place for boats at all , let alone a tub like the Eastport . She was there at the lower end , tugs behind her pushing , tugs ahead of her hauling , and tugs alongside lifting . From a tree dead ahead a hawser ran to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it would turn with a clank while the paddles churned the water . Then everything would stall , and on command , stop . It was n't a pretty show , as the boat was plated with iron which was rusty and scaly and dented , with stuff rubbing off on the men . But , at least to a hard-rock man , it was interesting , and I watched it a while before waving my paper at Sandy , in charge of things on shore at the tree . He waved back , but it was some time before a whistle blew , they all sat down for a rest , and he was able to join me . He took the receipt and read while a cook went around with a pot and ladled coffee into mess cups . Pretty soon he asked : " Landry ? Is n't that the man I met ? Mrs. Fournet 's father , who asked us in to questionBurke ? " " That 's right , " I said . " He did n't make himself known , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you said to me  --  matter of fact , she saw you whisperingand asked what it meant . He had supposed his cotton lost when the Navy took it over , and had n't wanted to embarrass me by bringing the subject up . But , when he learned I could get a receipt , or at least had a chance of getting one , he came up with this quick . " I flashed half of my fifty-dollar bill , then took out the other half and fitted the pieces together . He blinked , thenp195said : " Bill , I own up three hundred twenty-seven bales is more than I bargained for . I thought you might be able to swing  --  well , say a hundred bales  --  but this " " I 'm in it with him , share-and-share alike . " " You mean later ? Right now , he did n't ask cash ? " " That 's it . That 's how I 'm able to do it . " " ... I 'll have to get Lieutenant Ball . " He hailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in undershirt , dungarees , and straw hat , and had himself rowed ashore in a gig that dangled alongside . He too whistled when he saw the number of bales , then whistled again . " Listen at this , " he told Sandy : " . . . 327 bales , bearing the following marks and no other marks . ' That makes this valid in court , as it nullifies that CSA stencil ! Did that hombre know his cotton , the one who drew this up ! " " Still , " said Sandy , " the hombre who killed Le-grand  --  " " That does n't figure ! " barked Ball , " in any way , shape , or form ! Our orders are all that concern us , and our orders were receipt for loyal cotton . So far , we have n't found any . But if you know Cresap is loyal  --  " " I have my Army discharge , " I said . " And if the cotton 's lawfully acquired  --  " " I have a bill of sale covering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale stamped by the Clerk of the Court , torn bill , and I do n't know what else , and let him look them over . He asked to borrow them briefly , and went out to the ship . Then a belted seaman came ashore , carrying an oilskin package , and I took him for a courier on his way with my stuff for the flag boat . He legged it down through the woods , and I waited at least an hour , while work on the falls resumed . Then here he came backp196and boarded the ship again . Then Ball came back in the gig , the package in his hand . He handed it over , saying : " All right , Cresap , here you are , everything signed up . It 's an awful lot of prize for the Navy to give up , but orders are orders , even when they hurt . " " I thank the Navy , " I told him . " I thank you . " " It 's money in the bank . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaning close as he shook hands , trying to hide from Ball how excitedhe was . That night , by candlelight , we celebrated our luck , Mignon , Mr. Landry , and I , with three rum toddies . She was quiet , her eyes dreamy , but he wanted to talk and , as he said , make a clean , fresh start . He kept insisting : " I 'd like to make clear , it 's more than the money , sir . It 's also you , what you mean to Mignon , and if you 'll allow me to say so , what you mean to me . I 've been very concerned about you  --  I mean , what Frank might try to do in his vicious , vindictive way . But , with him going west , and you bound for Springfield , I would say the danger is past , so I can sleep nights . " " When does he leave ? " I asked him . " He has left . He went today  --  on foot . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back his gun , as he 's carrying lots of cash , and  --  he took himself off . " " Ca n't we forget about him ? " she wanted to know . " We can forget him ; that 's all I 'm trying to say . " " Then let's. "  |p197SO  BEGAN THE QUEER THREE wJ EKS of sitting around allthe time , waiting for a boat to go out on . At first I 'd go down each day to see Hager at the courthouse ; he 'd promiseda pass for the three of us when navigation resumed . But then she began going alone , because Dan paid me a call to warn me off the streets . The traders , he said , were being rounded up for shipment back to New Orleans on the Empire Parish , under arrest . If I got caught out , I 'd be shipped back , too . It seemed a strange reward for saviors of their country , as they 'd been assured they were , but that 's how the thing was handled , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So that 's how it came about that I stayed indoors all the time , waiting , waiting , and waiting . She 'd come in the morning , bringing my breakfast over , and when I 'd finished she 'd help me dress , which alwaystook some time and seemed to involve kisses . Thenp198we 'd take the tray back together , ducking across the back yards , and she 'd make some lunch . Then the three of us would sit , under the books in the sitting room , through the afternoon and evening . I would crack jokes , if , as , and when I remembered some . She would spend the money , all kinds of different ways : on a house in New Orleans ; on mahogany , silver , and cut glass for our dining room ; on a carriage with matched grays  --  but not often on clothes , for some reason . He would go around , touching the backs of books and talking about literature , especially Casanova , who he said was the greatest literary figure of the eighteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than of illegitimate children  --  of D'Artagnan , Jean Valjean , a whole endless gallery . " Then he 'd make her play Don Giovanni , who he said was Casanova in disguise , " as the librettist knew him well  --  and it all corresponds to him , not with Don Juan of Seville . " I got curious about it , and took down the memoirs one time , Volume I , to have a peep . But it was in French , and I could hardly understand a word . It all surprised me ; I 'd heard of Casanova as lover but did n't know he wrote anything . I ca n't say I quite got the point , as I had n't read enough , but I felt it was educational , and was always glad to listen . And while we talked and talked , and sipped our nightly grog , the invasion rolled upriver , all the Army and most of the Navy , until nothing was left in town but freight boats , the Guard , and the Q.M . Things had quieted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bees buzzed , flowers bloomed , perfume filled the air , and townspeople ventured out  --  the few who were still left and had n't skedaddled upriverbefore the invasion came in . When the Empire Parishp199went down , I ventured out too , to resume asking for my pass . Captain Hager shook hands , said it was " just a matter of days , with regular river schedules , as soon as we get to Shreveport . " I reported the news , and we celebrated a bit with an extra grog that night . And then one day , as we raced up the stairs with my breakfast dishes , the door opened in front of us and her father was there in the hall , a solemn look on his face . I supposed her visits to me were the reason and braced myself to argue , to say she was grown up now , that we meant to be married , that if she wanted to come it was none of his business . But that did n't seem to be it . He led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rucksack , blanket roll , overcoat , and hat , all in a neat pile . She stared , then asked : " Are you going away  --  or what ? " And then : " Oh ! Our passes have come ? Is that it ? " " Sit down , Daughter , Mr. Cresap . " He was very quiet , but also dramatic , and when we had sat he went on : " I 'm going to join up . Turns out Taylor was n't the idiot . I was . " " All right , " she said , " but what 's he done ? " " He 's whipped , that 's what ! " " Whipped ? Whipped who ? " " The Union ! War 's not over in Louisiana ! " " Well you do n't have to snap my head off , do you ? " " Daughter ! It 's not over . For me , or for you . " " Me ? I do n't even yet know what happened ! " " He smashed ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mansfield , he cut ' em to pieces , this whole Army of the Gulf ! It was a shambles , a slaughter , a rout ! Two of his scouts got through ; they 're up at the hotel now . They never sawp200anything like it ! It could n't happen , and it did ! But that 's just the beginning . They 're in a race now , he and the Union Army , for this place , for Alexandria . They 're in full flight to get out , and he does n't mean to let ' em . He 's shutting'em up , he 's out to capture every man  --  and that 's where I come in ! I 'm late , God forgive me ; I thought it was all over , but better late than never , the eleventh hour in the vineyard , and there 's things I can do ! I 'm on my way to report ! " He began to talk , then , reviling himself for giving up too soon , and then went back to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " do n't forget , when I 'm gone , that you must do something too . As a Reb , as a loyal Confederate , you have to ! You  --  " She cut in : " I 'll do what I can , of course ! " " Daughter , that 's not enough . " " How does anyone do more than they can ? " " It has to be something , not just good intentions ! " " Listen , you speak for your own self ! " " Do n't worry . I will . " He slung the rucksack over his shoulder , then held his hand out to me with a friendly , elegant smile , and sayingsomething about " my regret we now have to be enemies . " But I said , not seeing his hand : " Sit down , Mr. Landry . We have n't quite finished our talk  --  you have n't included me , so far , but I 'm in anyway , you may be surprised to learn . " " I do n't understand you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " ... I assume you 're an honorable man . " " You mean , Mr. Landry , you assume you can go traipsing off to jump on Taylor 's bandwagon , now it'sp201no longer a sinking ship , and that I wo n't mind at all , but will cut you in just the same for your full share of what I make at Springfield ? Have n't you forgotten that as a Reb , in arms against your country , you 'll have no standing in court ? You 're putting yourself once more in the spot you found yourself in when Burke informed on you in New Orleans . " " That seems to say you 'd euchre me , too . " " Not quite . You 've forgotten other things , too . " " What are you getting at now ? " " Your Union allegiance , Mr. Landry . " " It was coerced from me . I never took any oath . " " You took your freedom , though . " " I was born free ! " " You were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're going to be ! Take off your bag , Mr. Landry . You 're not going anywhere . " " I 'm going . And I warn you I 'm armed . " " I know you 're armed  --  I can see the bulge in your pocket . I did n't myself think necessary to strap on my Moore and Pond . But you start out of this place , I 'm followingyou down to the street , I 'm hailing the guard at Biossat 's , I 'm having you taken in , and I 'm charging you as a spy ! " " Then , my departure must wait on yours . " " Meaning , I 'm to leave your house ? " " I hope you do n't make me say it . " " I do n't go till I have your parole . " " Parole ? Parole ? " " Your word to me you 're going to stay put ! " " Mr. Cresap , I think you forget yourself . " " Mr. Landry , I must have your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept dictation  --  " " Goddam it , Mr. Landry , do you think I 'm playinggames ? Speak , and speak now , or I will ! I 'll not let you up easy , and they will break your neck ! " " . . . Sir , you leave me no choice . " " Say it . " " I pledge myself not to join  --  " "  --  the enemies of my country  --  " "  --  the Confederate States of America . " " I 'll accept that . " " Then , sir ? " " Leaving now , Mr. Landry . " I turned on my heel , walked out of there , and returned to my own flat . I went to the front room , peered out on the street , and everything looked the same . I wondered if it was true , the news that Landry had heard . I tried to think what it would mean to me . I was still trying when the knock came on the door . I let her in and followed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when all she did was stare . " What 's the matter ? " I growled . " Somethingon me ? " " Willie , I do n't know you any more . " " Do n't worry , it 's me , the same old one . " " But how could you talk to him like that ? " " You do n't see the reason ? " " I certainly do n't . " " Then maybe you need talking to , too . " She started to rake me over for how ungrateful I was , " after the way he 's treated you , almost as a son , asking you in all the time , letting me give you your meals , putting you in on the cotton . . . "  | " I 'm sick of that damned cotton ! " " Well , it 's his , you know ! " " Listen , I do n't know what 's his , what 's mine , or what 's the Navy 's any more , but I know this : He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the half-war  --  halfpeacewe 've got , the life-in-death that was inflicted on the Ancient Mariner . Do n't you know what that life-in-death was ? That albatross on his neck ? Do n't you know what he meant , that Samuel Taylor Coleridge , the man who wrote that poem ? " " ... What are you talking about ? " " He was an opium-eater ! " " What 's that got to do with Father ? " " The cotton 's his opium , that 's what . He thinks , in this half-war  --  half-peace he imagines , that it 's every man for himself , anything goes , devil take the hindmost . That 's not true . It 's not half-war  --  half-peace ; it 's war , as Dan Dorsey 's been trying to say , and it 's not any the less war that your father does n't like it and it does n't like him !

Well , he can guess again ; he ca n't have it both ways ! I 'll cut him in , now that I have his parole , but I 'd never have cut in a Reb who was out there shooting at me  --  and even that much I do n't pretend to like ! I told him once , and I tell you again , the cotton stinks  --  and I only live to see the day when I 'll be shut of it forever ! "  | " But taking it off her does n't stink ? " " Her ? ... Her ?

Now we know . " We were atremble , and from the beautiful time we 'd had , after breakfast that morning , it was cold , bitter , and ugly.  |p205IT  WAS TRUE , ALL RIGHT ; we 'd had the stuffing kicked outof us and skedasis was complete . We were on our way out and overnight , from being a quiet riverside town , with flowers perfuming the air , Alexandria was a hellhole on earth , with wounded men limping in , horses dying in the streets , splintered boats crashing down the falls , and in place of the perfume a smell of death , rot , and war . Hangingover it all was danger , because maybe we wanted out , but Taylor had different ideas and meant to bag us all . He surrounded the town and kept tightening the noose , his fires out in the woods creeping closer and closer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below so no supplies could come up , and suddenly rations were short . Also water was short ; with thirty thousand men and five thousand horses penned up in place built for four thousand , with no wells and cisterns not refilled since the rain Taylor arrived in , thep206supply ran out fast . That left Red River water , but it was so foul with corpses , swill , and filth that the boys got desperatelysick , and their filth was added to the original filth . Worst of all was the drought in Texas , which made the river low , so it did n't take a rise as it generally did in spring . It fell , and the Navy got stuck in the mud , ten of its best boats , up above the falls . That 's what hung things , because instead of continuing its march the Army had to halt , dig in , and try to get them out . And what it decided to do was put in a dam of sticks and stones and trees just above the town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boats . It was such a weird idea that I had n't the heart to look . The Red River current , which I 'd alreadyclocked with my eye by watching snags float by , was at least nine miles an hour , and trying to hold it with a makeshift pile of brush struck me as pathetic , like trying to hold an elephant by tying him with knitting yarn . Just the same , they started in to do it . Colored troops put in a pontoon bridge from a ramp in front of the courthouse to a spot on the left bank , which they finished in one day , and construction crews streamed over , so work could go forward from both sides of the river at once . Every day boats would go up through the swing draw out in the middle , with barges of stone and rubble , and axes would speak all the time , upriver from Alexandria and from the woods above Pineville . And all during that we sat , she , Mr. Landry , and I , in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other three weeks had been . He made it up with me , coming over after she left the same day as our brawl , to thank me " for the information , which Mignon has justp207mentioned to me , about Samuel Taylor Coleridge . I had n't known it before , but just verified it in the Britannica , and am truly grateful for it . " I said you could n't prove it by me , but I did hear it in college , and he repeated that such things to him were important and he counted himself in my debt . Then he asked me to supper , and I resumed taking my meals with them  --  a good thing , since the hotel ran out of food and otherwise I 'd have been out of luck . We did n't eat well but we ate , dried stuff from the store , prunes and apples and apricots , beans and peas and rice , stocked in barrels and sacks and kegs . He would n't allow me below to help bring anything up , and once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , and wondered what was in them . Every day he 'd go out for a stroll , to pick up such news as he could , and I 'd go down to the courthouse , which had been converted into a hospital and stank of wounded men , to pester for my pass . In between , the three of us would talk . " You 've no faith in the dam ? " he asked me one day . " Who wants to know ? " I said . " A loyal Reb ? " " No , Mr. Cresap , " he assured me , very solemn , " a loyal Union man . And since you bring it up , I may say that things have changed since we had our last discussion . War was not over in Louisiana  --  for a few days , at least . Now , I 'm sorry to say , it is  --  finally , and for keeps . I said it , did n't I ? That I was the fool , not Taylor , but they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's now a tiger made of paper , with just a token force of no more than five thousand men , banging away with artillery , lighting fires at night , and cutting off forage parties  --  ever since Kirby Smith , the military genius at Shreveport , took the bulk of his army away , to meet another invasion , ' coming downp208from the north  --  if it 's coming , if . So instead of the bird in hand , this Union army in Alexandria , we 're chasing a will-o ' - the- wisp , and my allegiance is settled , in heart as well as mouth . Taylor 's doing a wonderful job , but it still remains true there 's not one Reb soldier between this place and Shreveport . " " What 's that got to do with the dam ? " " Mr. Cresap , suppose it fails ? " .. Well ? We lose ten boats , I suppose . " " You just walk off and leave them ? " " Not I  --  this army . What else can we do ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union man I say  --  and do n't contradict me  --  no Union army dare pull out of this place and leave ten boats sitting . It would not obey the order ; the men would mutiny first ! The one thing it can do is march on up to Shreveport  --  and that 'll cook Taylor , Kirby Smith , the will-o ' - the- wisp chasers , and everythingReb in this section ! Because what Richmond is to the East , Shreveport is to the West  --  a base , a source of food , of munitions , of what 's needed to fight . That 's what this army can do , and that 's what it 's going to do , once the river tears that dam apart . " " What 's the rest of it , sir ? " " ... In Springfield , everything 's marking time . " " Springfield ? I thought we were talking of Shreve-port . " " Both are important to us  --  to you , to me , to Mignon . Nothing can litigate until the Navy gets out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you do n't get there right away , nothing 's lost , is there ? You 'll still have time for Shreveport . " " Yes . Shreveport ? "  | " The Army takes it , does n't it ? " " So you say , Mr. Landry . What then ? " " And the Navy does n't take it ? only by being stuck , but by being blocked off , from a hulk sunk in the river , the New Falls City , " at the mouth of Loggy Bayou , which is why they turned back in the first place , not from hearing the Army was whipped , as they 've been giving out . They ca n't get out of the mud , and even if they could , they ca n't get past the hulk . That means Shreveport 's an Army thing  --  does n't it ? " " All right , what then ? " " These people have confidence in the Army . " " What people , sir ? " " In Shreveport . No cotton 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'm going to upchuck . " " For a million dollars you 'd upchuck ? " " Did you upchuck with her ? " She 'd been sitting with me on the sofa , he facing us in a chair , his eyes roving the river . Now she blazed her eyes at me , then got up and went over to him . In her redcheckedgingham dress she kneeled beside him , took his hand in hers , and said : " Go on , lambie explain us , how do we get the million dollars  --  oh my , that would be heaven on this earth . " " So ? " I said . " The cotton 's not burned , and  --  " " I acquire it . I have friends in Shreveport . " " You mean , you buy it ? " " I mean I take title , on shares . Once they know it 's the Army , once I assure them of that , those people will trust me , I know . But two things I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
