 | " You should see them in Montefalcone , " the young man said . He described how the people were dancing in the streets and setting fire to portraits of Mussolini and burning Fascist symbols and how the soldiers had deserted their barracks , and the police headquarters had been burned and how even the carabinieri had gone to the hills . " I suppose they 'll go after the churches next , " Polenta said . " They usually do . " Fabio was shocked . " They 're going into the churches to pray , Padre , " he said . " I 'm sure . " " To give thanks for their deliverance , Padre . " " I 'm sure . Go on , go ring your bells . " He allowed Fabio to come into the bell tower , but he would n't help him find the bell ropes in the darkness . " Find them yourself . I 'm not going to help you , " the priest said . He was n't sure how he felt about Mussolini . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by that act had done more for the Church than any one other leader of Italy , but the Duce had been a fool and a clown , two traits that the priest despised above all others . Had he been born God , the priest had said , it was the clowns who would occupy the lowest rungs of hell . Despite the fog he started across the Piazza of the People to his church , Santa Maria of the Burning Oven , to be there in the event of any trouble . He was near the fountain when he heard Fabio call to him . " Oh , what a morning this is going to be for Italy , Padre . " The bell began to peal and then thunder over . Santa Vittoria , swinging free and out of control , the entire tower trembling and then the windows of the houses around the piazza . No one came into the piazza . Fabio ran to Santa Maria . " The people , " he called to the priest . " What 's the matter with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school too long , " Polenta said . " They do n't believe the bell any longer . " The summer before , all the people had run to the Piazza of the People  --  to help fight the fire , when the bells had begun to ring .  | When most of the town had collected , torches were lit and they found themselves surrounded by a company of Blackshirts from the barracks at Montefalcone . " We shall now proceed to pay our back taxes , " the officer announced . And they went through every pocket and every house in Santa Vittoria until every unburied lira in the city was taken . " This is no city to catch fire in , " the priest told Fabio . " Now when the bell rings , everyone gets up and bolts the door . That 's the kind of Christians you have in this town . " There is something about the truth that makes itself understood . When the bells ceased ringing , Fabio ran up and down the piazza in front of the houses , telling everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and gradually lights were lit and finally some of the Pietrosantos , most of whom live along the lanes leading into the piazza , opened their doors ; and when they saw it was Fabio running about in the fog they came out . There is a thing about Santa Vittoria that must be understood in order to understand this place . Whatever is known in Santa Vittoria is known by everyone in Santa Vittoria as soon as it happens . Some say it is because the walls of the houses are so thin that what is said in the first house is heard in the second and passed through the walls to the third , down through Old Town and up through High Town . Others say it happens because everyone is related to everyone else , that everyone shares the same blood and the same hearts and nerves and so what is experienced by one is felt by the next . Whatever it is , after the Pietrosantos went into the Piazza of the People it was soon thick with the others . They put Fabio up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the oldest and still the strongest of the Pietrosantos , hung Fabio 's bicycle from the statue of the turtle on the fountain so the beam of his bicycle lamp would shine on the young man . It threw Fabio 's shadow back onto the church facade and when he held up his hand before speaking the hand was twenty feet high on the stones . " A great thing has happened today , " Fabio called out . His voice is as thin as his body , but it is clear and it can be heard . " A great thing for us . A great thing for Italy . " The people  | leaned forward to hear Fabio , because good news is not a common commodity in this place . " Benito Mussolini , the tyrant , is dead , " he cried . There was no sound at all from the people . The face of Fabio showed that he was puzzled . He asked if they heard him and no one answered , but Fabio knew that they had heard . " The Duce has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still the silence , the only sound the water pouring from the fountain . " What is that to us ? " someone shouted . " What are you trying to tell us ? " " Why did you get us out of bed ? " they called . " Why did you ring the bell ? " His face was anguished . It is a fine face , long and clean and narrow like the blade of a new ax , the eyes deep and dark like ripe olives , and his hair so dark that it seems blue at times . Fabio 's skin is white and fine , not the color of copper pots like most of the faces here . " What does it mean to us ? " the first man shouted again . He wanted an answer . " It means freedom , " Fabio said , and he looked down . The people respect Fabio , but they were annoyed by what he had done . He went down the steps of the church and they cleared a path for him so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pissing Turtle . " You 've been away too long , Fabio , " a man said . " We do n't go to school here , Fabio . We work . We grow grapes , Fabio . You should n't have waked up the people . " " Excuse me , " he said . " I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry . " " It 's the books , " a woman told him . " You 've strained your mind . " Everyone nodded , because it is a known fact here that a few books are all right , like wine , but too much can be bad . Books break down brains . It was the cobbler Babbaluche who saved things , although it is usually his role to ruin them . " Leave the light there , " he ordered . He has a voice which sounds as if his throat was plated with brass ; it is always irritating  | and it is always heard . He limped , because he is a cripple , to the steps of the church . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you socks filled with shit , " Babbaluche began . There is no point in keeping it a secret . The cobbler is a man who is fascinated with excrement . Under the laws of Italy it is not allowed to put down on paper , even on paper that is not to be published , the things Babbaluche calls the people of Santa Vittoria . He compares our nastiness to that of a man who rises in the morning and finds that the shoe he has just put his foot in has been used the night before as a chamber pot . He can say these things because of something that happened to him years ago in front of all the people and which they allowed to happen . Babbaluche was a penance we had to bear . " How many of you would like to sink your boot in Copa 's ass ? " Babbaluche shouted . There was a cheer then . It was an ambition of everyone in the piazza . " As of this morning you have that right . " He went through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing of the local Fascist party who were known as The Band . " Who wants Mazzola ? " There was a cheer for the ruination of Mazzola . There was nothing political any longer about The Band . They had long ago ceased contributing to the national party or to Rome . They kept Santa Vittoria for themselves and stole from it , not too much at a time , but all of the time . The loudest cheer of all was reserved for Francucci . When Copa had taken over the city twenty years before , he had made his one speech . " Bread is the staff of life , " he told the people . " Bread is holy . Bread is too sacred to be left in the hands of greedy individuals . No penny of profit shall ever be made by any individual from the exploitation of the people 's bread so long as I am mayor , so help me God . " He closed all of the bakeries in Santa Vittoria and opened the  | Citizen 's Nonprofit Good Bread Association and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Francucci 's first act was to reduce the amount of wheat that went into a loaf and his second was to raise the price . Within a year after that the families of Copa , Mazzola and Francucci moved out of the wet dark caves they had lived in for one thousand years in Old Town up into the sunlight of High Town , where the gentry , what there is of gentry here , live . " I offer you the ass of Francucci , " Babbaluche said . There was a terrible roar from the crowd . They would turn the irrigation water for the terraces back on . The Band had turned it off years before , when the people refused to pay for their own water . They would fix the Funny Scale on which all of the grape growers had to weigh their grapes before selling them to Citizen 's Wine Cooperative . The people began to get angry . There is a saying here that if you ca n't do anything about something , pretend it does n't exist . But now that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had healed began to hurt again . It is impossible to guess what the crowd might have gone on to do had not Francucci chosen that moment to come down from High Town into the piazza . " Why were the bells ringing ? " he asked . It is asking a great deal to expect anyone to believe that the baker would have come down then ; one would have to know Cosimo Francucci to understand how it could happen . " Why are you looking at me like that ? " he cried . " Take your hands off me . " They used the baker like a soccer ball . He went from one end of the piazza to the other , and every player along the way had a penalty shot at him . When he could move no more they called his family to come down and take him away , and when they could n't carry him Fabio had to help them carry him back up the steep lane to High Town , more dead than alive . That is the way Fabio is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were starting back to their houses . The bloodletting had had a soothing effect . As the baker 's blood had flowed , the blood pressure of the people had dropped .  | " They should n't do that , " Fabio said . " The people are entitled to their blood , " Babbaluche said . " The people have a need for blood . They have a taste for it . Now give them big blood , important blood , " the cobbler said . " Tell them how the Duce died . " I " They do n't want to hear that , " Fabio said . " They want to go home . " " The people always want to hear when the mighty stag is brought to the ground by a pack of common dogs , " Babbaluche said . The cobbler was right . Fabio told them how the Fascist Grand Council had gathered in a palace in Rome the night before and how one man , the Count Dino Grandi , rose to his feet and in the face of Mussolini , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution . Resolved : The members of the Grand Council and the people of the glorious nation of Italy , having lost all confidence in the ability of the leader to lead any longer , convinced that he has destroyed the will of the army to fight any longer and the people to resist any longer ... . The people sat on the wet stones of the piazza and listened to Fabio . " Die , " one of them shouted . " How does he die ? " Fabio told them how at the end the Duce turned to his son-inIaw , husband of his own flesh and blood , and said to him , " And you , Ciano . Flesh of my flesh . Even you . " " Yes , even me . You have done all that you can do . " And how the next afternoon , on the burning hot empty Sunday afternoon in Rome the king had summoned the Duce to the royal palace and met him in the garden and behind the hedges so no one could see them , sang the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What have you done to us , Mussolini ? What have you done with our Alpini ? I 'll tell you what you 've done , Mussolini . You have murdered our Alpini . That 's what you have done , Mussolinil "  | " And you ? Do you believe it ? " the Duce says . " All the soldiers are singing it , " the king says . " Then there is nothing more to say . " " No , there is nothing more to say . " He told them how they put the Duce in a long black ambulance and took him through the streets of Rome . The Duce tells the guard that he is n't sick and the guard says , " But the people of Rome are fickle . " And how they took him through the ancient burning city , past all the monuments to the past Caesars , through the arches built for the great men , until they come to the walls of Rome and the Appian Way , the route that all the conquerors have taken to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of the village look inside . " An old man is dying , " one of them says . Mussolini says one sentence : " The people of Rome have always destroyed their greatest sons . " And how after that they drove past the country towns and then into the upland villages , the hills and the mountains growing higher , into the Abruzzi and then up into the snow fields into those mountains where the snow never ends . In the valleys it is night , but the snow fields are still touched by sun , and here he is met by four members of the Alpini who tell him to undress and when he is naked two of them take his arms and two of them take his legs and they lower him into a hole they have cut into the hard ice and they begin shoveling snow into the upright grave until only the great head is not buried . " You dishonor Italy , " the Duce says . They are simple men but one of them was equal to the job . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing what we do . " So in the manner of the Alpini , Fabio tells them , the Duce has died , frozen to death in foreign snow . When he was through with the story some of the women were crying , not for the Duce , but for the men of Santa Vittoria who were sent to the Alpini . They left one morning in May 1941 , twenty-three young men , marching down the mountain , singing and shouting all the way to the Montefalcone road , the feathers on those silly hats bending with the breeze , the people standing  | on the Fat Wall waving and waving until the last of them could be seen no more . Not one of them was ever seen or heard from again . We know now that this is n't the way the Duce died , but we always tell it this way because we like his death this way and it is more fitting to us.  | THERE WAS no way to keep the people in the piazza after that , because the sun had come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , but the people could see it touching the tiles on the roofs of the houses and nothing could hold them after that . " No one works today , " Babbaluche shouted . " A day of holiday . " " A day of celebration , " Bombolini called . But the people did n't listen to either of them . The sun drives the people here . It is an instinct that has beeir bred into them . Even when they ca n't see the sun or it ca n't be seen , in the darkest lanes in Old Town , when the sun comes up the people get up . It drives them out of the houses and it drives them down to the terraces to tend the vines .  | " Tell them , Fabio , " the cobbler said . " This is a great day for Italy , " Fabio said . " No one should work today . " They poured out of the piazza and down the streets to get their tools , deaf to anything now but the needs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five or six of them left in the Piazza of the People . These men went across the piazza from the church and sat around the edge of the Fountain of the Pissing Turtle , while Fabio climbed up and took down his bicycle . " For twenty years I dreamed of this day , " Babbaluche said , " and now look at it . " He swept his hand around the empty piazza . " This is the kind of people you have in this place , Fabio . Do n't ever allow yourself to forget it . " They sat and listened to the water until the priest passed in front of them on his way to the bell tower . " There will be a Low Mass for the dead , " he said to Fabio . " For one of the heroes of the Church , " Babbaluche said . " The dead will be respected , " the priest said . " And when do you think the Vatican will get around to the living ? " the cobbler said . It was an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them beard the other any longer . But it bothered Fabio . " To think that I , Ugo Babbaluche , outlived that bastard Mussolini , " the cobbler said . " It 's something . I 'm alive and that bastard 's dead . " " It calls for a drink , " Bombolini said , and all of them , at once , as if someone had set off a silent alarm , stood up and began to follow the wine seller across the piazza to his wineshop . He was unlocking the folding iron gate over the front door , when his wife looked out of the window above the door . " See that they pay , " she said to him . " See that you make them pay . " He was embarrassed . " She lacks a sense of history , " he said . . It was damp and chilly in the shop , but the warm air from the piazza and the warmth from the wine soon warmed them . " What do you think is going to happen ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Why should anything happen ? " It is the feeling here . No matter what takes place in Rome or  | happens in the world , for a few days or a few weeks things might be a little different , but they always return to the way they were before . " The Germans will come , " Fabio said . He had put his head down on one of the tables because he was tired . He was suddenly embarrassed to be the center of the men 's group . He had never spoken much with the men before , and now he was one of them . " No they wo n't , " one of them said . " Whv would they want to come here ? " " If Italy gets out of the war , " Fabio said , " the Germans are n't going to leave Italy for the Americans and the English . " " No , " Pietrosanto said . " There 's nothing here for them . " " There 's nothing here for us , " Bombolini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't push too far , but still he told them about the tanks and armored cars he had seen coming into Montefalcone . " Montefalcone is Montefalcone and Santa Vittoria is Santa Vittoria , " the cobbler said . " One is a jewel and one is a shit house . " They drank to this . " Only a man born in Santa Vittoria can ever learn how to make a living out of it , " one said . " What would the Germans do here ? " They drank to this as well . The wife of Bombolini came down the back stairs and into the wineshop and she looked at their glasses of vermouth and anisette and she stared at their eyes . " Did they pay ? " " They paid , " Bombolini said . " Let 's see the money . " She went to the drawer in the table by the big wine barrel . There was nothing in it . " This is a historic day , " Bombolini said . " You do n't ask for money on a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They nodded their heads at Rosa Bombolini . They were afraid of her . She has the toughest tongue in the city and no shyness about putting it to use . She studied them . " What a bunch of patriots . " She began taking the glasses from them moving them toward the door . " Take your patriotism out  | into the piazza where it belongs . " When they were in the sunlight at the door she said , " That 's the trouble with this country . The whole place is filled with penniless patriots . " They could hear the sound of a drum coming down from one of the lanes in High Town that lead down into the piazza . Capoferro the town crier was announcing the Duce 's death . " You should put your fist in her mouth , " one of the men told Bombolini , and all of them nodded ; but each one knew that if he were married to Rosa Bombolini he would keep his fists to himself . " Women and asses and nuts require strong hands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a sad house where the cock is silent and the hen crows . " They nodded at this too , including Bombolini . There was a blast from the automobile horn that Capoferro carried and then a roll on his goatskin drum . He was coming down into the piazza . Only people born here can understand Capoferro . He has some kind of trouble with his speech and sometimes it takes two and three people to understand him , but at least what he says is remembered . There must be some kind of law of the world , Fabio thinks , a law of compensation he calls it , that makes crippled men carry messages and unhappy people run happy places and people like Capoferro become town criers . He had come across the piazza now and was beating the goatskin drum . " Nido Muzzlini dead . " Barrrrombarrrummmbarrrum . A squeeze on the automobile horn . " Tyrant dead . All Idly weeps . " **25;55;TOOLONG . Horn . " Benidolini is no more . Idly moans . " " No , no , " Fabio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Capoferro said . He struck himself on the head with his drumsticks . He looked at the men . " You want to celebrate ? " the crier said . " For some wine I 'll drum you a dance . " " Wait , " Bombolini said . He went back across the piazza and around to the back entrance of the wineshop on the Street of  | D'Annunzio the Poet and he came back with two bottles of wine . " Keep your back to the shop , " he said . It was good vermouth . They passed the bottles around . " I 'll drum the tiles down from the roofs , " Capoferro said . He took a very long drink , it is said that he is over one hundred years old and it is probably true , and he began to drum . At first none of them did anything , but then Babbaluche began to dance . He is crippled because of something they did to him here , but Capoferro slowed the drum beat and the cobbler began to drag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance . " I never thought I 'd dance at his funeral , " he shouted . The sun was hot now and they had had nothing to eat since the night before , and the wine began to go to their heads . After a while Bombolini began to dance with the cobbler and they went around and around the Fountain of the Pissing Turtle while Capoferro beat the goatskin drum and some of the men clapped their hands . Babbaluche 's daughter had come up from Old Town into the piazza , and when she saw her father she seized his arm and brought it up behind his back the way the carabinieri do it , and she began to pull him across the piazza with her to the Corso Mussolini that leads down into Old Town . He gave the bottle to one of the men and that was a mistake , because Rosa Bombolini saw it and came out of the wineshop and across the piazza to them . " You thieving sons of bitches , " she said , and she took the bottle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drum . " Control your woman . " " You had better leave , " Bombolini said . " She 's going to break your drum . " Since the wine was gone and the drum was no longer playing and it was hot , they began to leave and soon only Fabio and the wine merchant were left in the piazza besides the children and the oxen and the old women getting water from the fountain . They had nothing to say to each other . " The best thing I can do right now , " Bombolini said , " is to go back to bed . Goodbye , Fabio . " It was the end of the celebration . Fabio was alone . He decided to go down into Old Town and sleep on a mat in his cousin Er-  | nesto 's house and he crossed the piazza and started down the steep Corso . It was very hot now . The door to the furnace of Africa , as we say around here , was open . An old woman was sitting in the darkness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all the noise about ? " she shouted at him . She was hard of hearing . " A death , " Fabio shouted at her . " Someone died . " " Who ? " " Mussolini . Benito Mussolini . " She looked at him and shook her head . " No , no , " she mumbled , " no , I do n't know him . " " It 's nobody from here , " Fabio told her . " Oh . " Her face became as dark and blank as the doorway . The house smelled . In truth , it stank . Ernesto was no housekeeper . There was a pot of hard cold beans over the fireplace and although they were hard to swallow Fabio ate them with enjoyment . " So this is my feast . This is the reward , " he said aloud . He found a mat and cleared it off and stretched out on it and looked up at the smoke-darkened ceiling . There was no sound at all in the city , not a cock or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was now nine o'clock in the morning . This then was the extent of the celebration of the death of the dictator . Thus did the twentieth year of the glorious reign of the Everlasting Imperial Fascist Empire come to a close in the city of Santa Vittoria.  | ABTO woBE in the early afternoon . He was still tired , but he woke because he was hungry . He looked around the small house , but there was nothing in it to eat , not a piece of stale bread or hard cheese . He was sorry he had eaten all the cold beans . He left a note for Ernesto , " Ants would starve to death in your house if ants would come into it , " and he went out into the Corso Mussolini and started up it toward the Piazza of the People to try to buy some bread and cheese and wine . The midday sun blinded him and he was forced to hold onto the walls of the houses until his eyes could adjust to the glare . When he reached the piazza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looking back down toward Old Town , but he was too blinded to see what it was they were looking at .  | The Piazza of the People is the center of Santa Vittoria . It is a flat plateau of cobblestones that divides the city in two parts . Above the piazza is High Town where the houses sit on a saddle of land in the sun . No one knows why the city was n't built there in the first place . The people who live in High Town are called Goats . The people who live around the piazza are called Turtles because of the fountain . Below the piazza is Low Town , or Old Town , where the Frogs live , because in the spring , after a rain , little green frogs hop in the dank , moss-green streets until the rats and the cats and the children get to them . On a tourist map , although tourists do n't come here , Old Town is listed as the Medieval Section which makes it sound better . Frogs almost never marry Turtles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way they are here . The city is steep . The Corso Mussolini , which runs through Old Town up to the Piazza of the People , is so steep in places that the street becomes flights of stone stairs . The Corso runs down to the Fat Gate which is the main passage through the Fat Wall which the Romans began and which someone else finished and which runs all of the way around Santa Vittoria . There is another way out , the Thin Gate , but this is used mainly by small boys and goats since the track that leads down the mountain from it is so steep . If you stand in the center of the Piazza of the People , where Fabio was standing , you are almost at eye level with the second pride of Santa Vittoria , the one achievement of the Fascist movement here , the tall soaring cement-skinned water tower which rests on three great long thin steel legs like the head on the top of an enormous spider . Written on the cement tank in black block letters were these words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although little of it could be seen from the piazza , was DUCE DUCE DUCE DUCE DUCE DUCE DUCE DU Below the tower in Old Town , near the Thin Gate , was the first pride of the city , the Citizen 's Cooperative Wine Celler , and on  | the roof of the teller was a large blue and red sign which read " Cinzano " since most of the wine made here is sold in the end to the Cinzano family . Fabio could see none of it . In the wineshop his problem was reversed . In the shop it was dark and he was blinded again . He had passed Rosa Bombolini , standing in the doorway with her arms crossed and staring toward Old Town , but she had not followed him when he entered the shop and he was forced to feel in the darkness for a chair . He waited for his sight to return and as he sat he heard someone crying . " Can I help you ? " Fabio said . The girl did n't answer him . " Do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Angela ? " " Yes , it 's me . " He tried to say something that would sound helpful or sensible , but he could think of nothing to say to her . Nothing at all . Not any single word would come to him . He closed his eyes and tried to force one single word to come and nothing came , only her name , and he knew that would n't do . There was this about Fabio then . Although he had never actually spoken to this girl alone or said her name aloud before or heard her say his name , he was in love with Angela Bombolini . This kind of thing happens here more often than in other places . There is a kind of love here that is called " thunderbolt love . " A girl looks out of the window and she sees a boy she has seen ten thousand times before and all at once a thunderbolt hits her and she realizes that she is madly in love with him . From that moment she dedicates her life to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proof , the Final Truth , if he were to demand it of her , even though he might not know her name or that she exists . When it happens they say , " Fabio sees Angela in his soup . " She is everywhere . The great torture and fear of the thunderbolt lover is that the one he loves will not return the love . Life is impossible then and unbearable . So great is the fear of being rejected , of being left with the empty horribleness of a life deprived of love , that many thunderbolt lovers never admit to their love and suffer their love in silence . Every once in a while they kill themselves and people  | always are amazed because they have no idea of the hell the dead person was fleeing from . Most people , girls and boys , when struck by the thunderbolt , show the effects as clearly as if they had been struck with a true bolt . But Fabio is more clever than most people . All that he did was blush . When Angela 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in the piazza he turned a deep red , but no one so far was conscious of what was taking place . He was still trying to think of the proper thing to say when he realized that Angela 's mother was standing over him . " Did she get what you want ? " " Oh . Oh , no . She did n't . I want some bread and cheese and wine . " Why did n't you get him what he wants ? " Rosa Bombolini shouted at Angela . " He sits here dry while you wet the floor . " He saw Angela get up and go into the back room , and his heart flew out to her . It was the only word . The heart flew to her . He had now managed to say six or eight words and get her in trouble . ? When she came back she put a plate of cheese in front of him and a glass of wine . " No bread , " she said . " Why not ? " It was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " Oh , yes . The baker . Of course . " She must think that I am an idiot , Fabio thought . " I did n't mean to get you in trouble . " " She does n't like my crying . " " You have a perfect right to cry , " Fabio said . " Cry all you want . " He felt his face turning red . He sat at the table and ate the cheese , listening to her cry . " Why are you crying ? " he said at last . " You know why , " Angela said . " Why are you torturing me ? " He found himself turning red once more and wondering what it was he did that caused him to harm the person he least in the world wished to harm . " I do n't know why , " Fabio said . " Him , " she said . " You saw him . " She nodded her head in the direction of the door and the piazza  | beyond . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and looked out . The groups of people were still in the piazza . He could see across the piazza and down toward Old Town , toward which all the people were looking , even though he was forced to look over Rosa Bombolini 's broad shoulder . He could see nothing at first , but finally his eyes were able to pick out the movement and he felt his heart jump . He could feel his heart at that moment actually rise in his chest and touch something in his throat , as if he had a live fish in his chest . " Oh , Mother of God , " Fabio said . He made the sign of the cross . " What is your father doing up there ? " Two thirds of the way up the water tower , still at least one hundred feet below the concrete tank and the safety of the little iron railing that runs around it , not moving at all now , silhouetted against the sky and the mountains beyond Santa Vittoria , gripping the little thin , narrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clung Italo Bombolini . " What is your father doing up there ? " As soon as he said this for a second time Fabio knew two things : that someone was going to have to help Italo Bombolini and that it was going to be himself . " Why does it have to be me ? " Fabio said aloud . He was astonished and ashamed that he had said it aloud . He turned away from Angela then . The figure was moving once more , moving with a terrible slowness upward . " He 's going to be all right . I 've climbed mountains . I know how people climb . He knows his way around up there . " She began to cry again . Fabio went outside and tapped Rosa Bombolini on the shoulder . " Do you have a length of rope ? A good strong one ? " " Oh , no , " Rosa Bombolini said . " You do n't risk your life to save his fat pride . He 's going to fall . Let him fall . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son of a bitch ca n't come down , " she said , and Fabio turned red again . He had never heard a woman talk about her husband or a man in this fashion before . " He 's going to come down in that piazza like an ox falling off a roof . "  | " I 'm going whether you get me the rope or not , " Fabio said . In the end she got him a rope . She got him two good lengths of rope and she also came back with a basket containing cheese and some olives and two bottles of wine and a fiasco of grappa , the strong raw brandy the peasants distill here . " I ca n't carry all of this , " Fabio said . " Angela will meet you in the Corso with a knapsack , " Signora lombolini said . Angela passed them then , still crying , and because she was running she was forced to lift up her skirts , and despite the fact that it was a matter of life and death , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quality and condition of her legs , that they were so strong and well-shaped and so brown and clean-looking . " Why are you so red ? " Rosa Bombolini asked him . " Are you sure you are all right ? " I am very much all right , Fabio thought . I am about to save the father of the woman I love , and she will be grateful to me for the rest of my life . He broke into a trot , although he knew he should save his energy . He met Angela Bombolini at the curve in the Corso Mussolini down below Babbaluche 's house . " Let him fall off , " the cobbler told him . " It would be a public service to the city . " Angela handed him a black knapsack made of imitation leather that had once been the property of the Young Fascist Scouts , and the outer flap of which read : " This sack belongs to Bruno . Do n't touch or death " On the other side , burned into the leather , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It caused both of them to laugh . " I 'll pray for you , Fabio , " she said . It was the first time he had ever heard her use his name . The ladder shocked Fabio . He had not looked at it in many years , and he was frightened to see how narrow and inadequate it was . It was not a ladder at all , but long lengths of pipe , five or six inches around , which were joined together and into which small round iron spikes had been fixed , at intervals of six or eight inches , to serve as foot and hand holds . " Do n't look up , Fabio . Just go up , " someone said to him . " Do n't go up . You ca n't help him . "  | He tightened his belt so his shirt would stay in and slung the ropes around his shoulders and tied the bottoms of his pants around his ankles with rough twine so they would n't flap . " You 're a fool to go , Fabio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fabio pulled himself up onto the pipe and for one moment he was forced to look up , and he was astonished to see how far up the fat wine seller had managed to pull himself . The metal was hot to the touch but not hot enough to burn and he took a deep breath then and began to climb . It was not hard for him at first , but he was surprised how narrow the little spikes were ; they felt even smaller than they looked . Something wet touched his hair and he realized it was paint from the buckets Bombolini had yoked about his neck . He tried to look neither up nor down , but out across the mountain slope , the green terraces down below , across the valley ; he fixed his eye on Montefalcone . All at once there was a tremendous shout from the people in the piazza below . He pulled himself in against the pipe and waited for the body of Bombolini to rush by him . When nothing happened he looked up and he could see Angela 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the wind has blown open . Bombolini had missed his footing ; but somehow , instead of falling , he had managed to hang on with one foot and one hand and now he hung there , swaying back and forth , trying to pull himself back to the pipe . Fabio could feel the pipe trembling from the effort and it frightened him , and then he heard a second cheer from the piazza and he looked up and Bornbolini was climbing upward again . * * * Across the piazza from the wineshop , in the cellar of the Leaders ' Mansion where The Band had barricaded themselves , they heard the shout . " It wo n't be much longer now , " Dr. Bara said . " They 're getting the feel of it . The mob is feeling its muscle . It 's only a matter of time now . " All of them were there , Copa and Mazzola , Dr. Bara , Vittorini the mail clerk , their families , their children and even Francucci , his eyes sealed , his teeth broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't come , " Mazzola said . " Maybe they 're cheering so.mething else . " " They wo n't hurt us , " the wife of Francucci said . " We 've already paid the price . " " What , for twenty years of rotten bread ? " the doctor said . " You have only paid the first installment . " " If we knew who was leading them we might be able to figure out something , " Copa , the mayor , said . " Every man has his price , " Mazzola said . " Where the hell is Pelo ? " Copa asked . " I 'll break that bastard 's neck . " They had sent Romano Pelo , the least offensive of men , a shadow of a human being , to go into the town and find out what the noise from the Piazza Mussolini was about . He had not come back . Now they sat in the darkness of the cellar of the Mansion , the government house of Santa Vittoria , behind barricaded doors , and waited and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , " Mazzola said . " They 'll forget us . The people 's memory is short . " Mazzola was always hoping for the best . There was another shout from the piazza , this time loud enough to seem to come right through the stones of the house and it made the baker begin to weep . " All I ever did for them was to bake their bread and now they want to come and harm me , " Francucci said . He was becoming obsessed with the idea that the people wanted to put him in his own bread ovens and bake him alive . " We must find a way to surrender to them before they can come to us , " Vittorini said . " In that way we can surrender on our own terms . "  | Little by little , as the day wore on , the mail clerk was assuming command in the cellar . He was not a Fascist , but he was a paid employee of the state , a " functionary " as he preferred to call himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of form he felt it his duty to be counted with the recognized legal machinery of government . If the Communists ever take over Italy or Santa Vittoria , Vittorini will hang a picture of Marx in the post office . " The thing we must do now is seize the initiative , " Vittorini said . " Very beautiful words , " Dr. Bara said . ' Well stated . " The most impressive fact about Vittorini , more impressive even than his character , is the uniform he is entitled to wear , and which he wears on all state and religious holidays , and which he had the wisdom to put on this morning . It is from one of the fine regiments although no one remembers the name of it now or the number . It was made from a white whipcord twill that had been cleaned and bleached so many times that it was impossible to look directly at Vittorini in the sunlight . Across his chest he wore a red-and-white-and-green silken sash , and on the sash was a gold medal that swam in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were black patent-leather boots that flared out at the knee and a sword in a golden scabbard that clinked against the cobblestones when he crossed the piazza to enter the church . The green epaulets are trimmed with gold braid , but most of all it is Vittorini 's hat . The hat is made of shiny black patent leather with a little stubby visor and from the top , which is high , cascades a fall of cock 's plumes , a shiny black-and-green shower of them so that when Vittorini walks Vittorini ripples . ' We must discover the nature of the enemy , " Vittorini told them , " and capitulate to it . They must not come and take ; we must give . It is the only way . " He shook his head to emphasize his point , and the dark river of feathers began to run again . " These are very beautiful words , " the doctor said . " Where in Christ is Pelo ? " Copa said .  | ACHE IRON GRILLWORK of the catwalk that circles the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was hot to the touch , but Bombolini never felt the burning when he crawled up onto the walk . He sank onto the iron and almost at once he slept . He had no intention of ever getting off the tower . He had prepared himself to die . He even yearned for the release of dropping softly down through the softness of the afternoon sky . He knew the people in the piazza were waiting for his last performance and he would n't disappoint them , but at the moment he was too tired even to contemplate dying . That would have to wait until he woke again , unless he rolled off the walk while he slept . Until then he lay stretched on the iron slats and burned . When he did wake he was conscious of three things . His eyes were pressed against the open slots of the grillwork and he could  | see from the shadows of things far below him that time , a good deal of time , had passed . Part of his body was in shadow . He watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The road was ankle-deep in dust , and white and bone dry , and it looked as if it had been drawn through the green terraces by a piece of white chalk . At each step a plume of dust spiraled up behind the cart and hung in the still air of late afternoon like a white banner . I am thirsty , Bombolini thought . I am dying of thirst . He could see the people working on the terraces in the vineyards , deep among the vines , working in the shaded tunnels of fat , green grape leaves , resting in the cool of the wine-green shade . And he could hear the sound of water bubbling by his ear , just on the other side of the thin concrete skin of the water tank . I am being driven crazy , Bombolini thought . And finally he became conscious that someone else was on the tower with him . From the other side of the tank came a rhythmic sound , a soft and steady lapping like waves on the side of an anchored boat . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tower , he told himself . He tried to say something , but there was no sound . He tried to move and found that it was impossible . I ca n't even kill myself , he said to himself , and he sighed , and then his eyes saw the wine bottle , the cork out of the neck , standing at attention like a little soldier a few inches away from his hand . I will drink a little of this wine and then roll off , he told himself . The wine was hot from the sun , but the heat did n't bother Bombolini . He could feel the wine run down his throat and enter his stomach and then begin to course through the bulk of his body as if it were the sun itself . The second swallow was easier and each one after that became easier , every mouthful exploding inside him like a small hot sun , the source of life itself running inside him . He could feel it go poom in his stomach . The wine was working for Italo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has lost too much blood . When he was through with the bottle he found he could sit up , and he leaned against the concrete and all at once allowed his legs to drop over the side of the catwalk , which caused a great shout from the piazza . " Who 's on the tower ? " he said .  | " Fabio . " The sound stopped but then it resumed , the slap , slap of the paintbrush against the concrete . " I knew it would be Fabio , " Bombolini said . It was an effort for him to talk . " If anyone would come for me I knew it would be Fabio . Fabio ? " " Yes ? " " God shower His blessings on you , Fabio . " Fabio was unable to answer . Things like this embarrass the people here . It might be all right for Sicilians , but not here . They are very emotional and vulgar and sentimental , much too emotional for us . " Let me see you , Fabio . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catwalk starts to fall off . " " Fascist bastards , " Bombolini said . " They cheated on the specifications . They were supposed to put up a ladder and they put up that pipe and pocketed the difference . They were supposed to put a platform up here and they put up this thing . How far are you now ? " Fabio had already painted out MUSSOLINI IS ALWAYS RIGHT and was halfway through the eight DUCE 'S . " Four more to go , eh ? " " Yes . Whoever did it , overdid it , " Fabio said . " I did it , " Bombolini said . Fabio was silent . It embarrassed him to think of a man risking his life to climb a tower and write DUCE DUCE DUCE all over the side of it . And he could not imagine this man as ever having been young . " I was young once , you know . I was tall and lean . I used to look like Garibaldi . I had long shiny-black hair . I wonder what made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't even tired . " Fabio went on with the painting . " I know what you 're thinking , Fabio . You do n't have to tell me , " Bombolini said . " But you have to try and understand how it was then . It was n't like this now at first , Fabio . He was beautiful at first , Fabio . He was promises for us . " They felt the tower tremble and they gripped the iron railing ,  | but then it passed . The mountain rises and falls here , a little bit each day , like a giant shifting in his sleep . " And what promises , Fabio . I do n't mean the stupid ones like building the army and making Italy fierce again . They were going to help us build a school and pay for teachers . Everybody was going to join in . They were going to help us build a road , and we were going to plant the hillsides with grass and trees so the land would stay on the hills and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more landslides . We believed that , Fabio . Oh , there was excitement then , Fabio . Everything seemed possible . And we believed . " " How could you ? " Fabio said . " You believed because you wanted to believe . " " Yes . And because he believed , too . I really think Mussolini believed . " " And then none of it happened . " " Some of it happened . This thing , this tower , happened . Oh , we were going to be like America here , Fabio . Look . " The wine seller pointed although Fabio could not see him . " Can you see Scarafaggio from where you are ? " Fabio said that he could . " When the tower was built they fell down in the streets with envy from looking at us . Our turn next , ' they said . It 's happening . The miracle is happening . ' " He told Fabio of the famous morning when the tower was to be dedicated . The dignitaries had come from Montefalcone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with flags and flowers . A great flag had covered the top of the tower and when the string was pulled and the tank was revealed , there , shining fresh and black in the morning sun , was MUSSOLINI IS ALWAYS RIGHT and all the DUCE 'S , and on the catwalk was Italo Bombolini . " I was a hero once , for a few days , and then they turned the water off , " Bombolini said . " After that I was a fool . " When the leaders from Montefalcone had gone The Band assumed control of the water tower and began to charge for the water . When the grape growers refused to pay , the water was turned off , and soon the cement spillways began to fill with leaves and dirt and the people went back to the old way , praying to God  | to send rain , and He was , as always , not quite generous enough . But the people forgot about the tower . While he talked Bombolini threw the bottle off the tower , and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town and finally crashed in a tinkle of glass on the roof of the Cooperative Wine Cellar . A minute or two afterward an old man with white hair and a face as red as wine came out onto the roof and shook his fist at them . It was Old Vines , the keeper of the wine . " I 've upset the sleep of the wine , " Bombolini said . " If he had a rifle he would shoot us off this tower . Are you almost done ? " " Yes . Two more DucE 's and one DU . " " I ran out of paint . No , " he said , " it was n't Mussolini himself at first . We did n't blame him . It was the water . The country might have been falling apart , but we could n't see it . You know what The Master says . Men are apt to deceive themselves in big things , but they rarely do so in particulars : " " I do n't know who The Master is . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's my master . Have you studied him ? " Fabio said that he had . " Well I read him . I memorize him , " the wine seller said . " I have read The Prince forty-three times . " The young man was astonished by this information , and he did n't believe it . His father had once told him that beneath Bornbolini 's clownish exterior there was a better mind than anyone could expect , but Fabio had never been able to see any sign of it . " I do n't suppose there is any more wine ? " Fabio thought about it . If Bombolini got drunk it might be the end of them both , and yet the wine had made the journey down seem possible . He opened the knapsack and uncorked the second bottle of wine and slid it along the catwalk . " God shower blessings on you , Fabio . Rain them down on you . Flood you with them , Fabio . God drown you in blessings . " And he began to drink the hot red wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm through with this bottle , " Bombolini said , " I 'm going off this tower , Fabio . " " Oh no , " Fabio said .  | " I ca n't disappoint my audience . Look at them down there . They 've been waiting for me all day . " " I did n't come up here for nothing . " " Can you imagine what they would say ? The poor son of a bitch ca n't even fall off the tower . " The young man began to paint more swiftly . The paint was running short , and he was becoming tired . If he was ever to get Angela 's father down , it would have to be done soon , before he got too tired , before darkness fell on them , before the effect of the wine began to wear off . The men and the women were on their way up from the terraces by then . Wherever Fabio looked he could see people coming out from the shadows of the vines onto the track that comes up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were already up the mountain , so when Bombolini let fly the second bottle the noise from the lower piazza , and now from the Piazza of the People as well , was the loudest of the day . Fabio by then had reached the bottom of the bucket and was on the last letter . It was strange , but there was exactly enough paint left to paint out the last letter , a U , and not a brushful more . " Now throw the bucket , " Bombolini said . Fabio threw the first bucket far out over the town , away from the piazza , out over the Fat Wall so that no one could get hurt . " Now the brush . " he threw the brush . There was a shout from the crowd . He threw the cheese , the olives , the second bucket , and each time the crowd roared and the noise grew louder and by the time Fabio threw the knapsack the piazza was in an uproar . " All right , let 's go now , " Fabio shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine seller . He came around to the side of the catwalk where Bombolini sat , and as he did the rusted iron bolts that had been drilled into the concrete years before suddenly cried out , screamed , in protest . He ran along the narrow walk and past Bombolini and on to the spiked pipe so that his weight was no longer on the catwalk . Now the people in the piazza were silent . There was no sound from the city at all . " They do n't want you to fall , do you see ? " Fabio said . " If they wanted you to fall they would be shouting for you . " While he talked he reached up and began to work the lengths  | of rope under the arms and across the back and around the waist of Bombolini . His plan was crude , but Fabio felt it might work . He would tie the wine seller to the pipe , literally lash him to it , and then bring him down it spike by spike . He would place Bornbolini 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then work the ropes down around him and the pipe and when he was secured there he would lift the next foot down . He would bring him down , all bound with ropes , like a bear being brought down from the high mountains . He made Bombolini slide along the narrow catwalk until he was at the pipe and then dip down until his feet could find the spikes to stand on . Even from where they were , so high above the piazza , they could hear the people suck in their breaths . When he was tied to the pipe they did n't start at once , because both of them were tired even then . ' Why are you doing this for me , Fabio ? " Bombolini asked . Fabio did n't answer him . How could he mention Angela ? He wondered if he would have been on this pipe now for anyone else 's father , but then he realized that only Angela 's father would be doing such a thing . " Why ? " " Because you were a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others in trouble . " " Oh , Fabio , " Bombolini said . " I do n't know where you get ideas like that . It is people 's responsibility to look after themselves and nothing more . Let us try a step . " Fabio lifted Bombolini 's right foot and brought it down to the next spike below , and then he climbed up so that his head was level with Bombolini 's waist and he worked the ropes down a foot or more . They did it several times and rested . " Fabio ? " " Yes . " " I want you to know one thing , Fabio . If I ever get offf this tower and I am alive , if there is ever one thing in the world that you want and I can give it to you , I want you to ask me for it and I will give it to you . " Why could n't he say it right then ? Why could n't he be honest with himself and with this man he had lashed to a spiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own ? One word . A few  | words  --  Yes , there is one thing : Angela ; I want your daughter Angela in marriage . Instead , all he could do was murmur , " Come on , come on , " and feel himself turning red . Just before they began again , Bombolini began to point to the north . " Oh , my God , " he said . " Can you see that ? Can you see there ? " " Yes . Something is burning , " Fabio said . " Some city is on fire . " They could see a cloud of gray , which the late afternoon sun turned gold at the top . It rose from a city which sat on the top of a mountain like a crown , and the crown was in flames . " The whole mountain is burning , " Bombolini said , and it was true .  | IN zIIE Leaders ' Mansion they could hear the shouts from the piazza , and the cheering . The noise was now steady and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them was ready to believe that the cheering was for Italo Bombolini . " Why would Pelo tell a thing like that ? " Mazzola asked . " Because Pelo is a bastard , that 's why , " Copa said . Pelo had come back from the Piazza Mussolini and when no one in the Piazza of the People was looking he had knocked twice on the door as directed . " Who are they cheering ? " Vittorini had called . " Bombolini . " Vittorini could not believe his ears . " Italo Bombolini , " Pelo said . " The wine seller . The wine merchant . The Sicilian boob. "  | " I do n't believe you , " Vittorini said . " But it is the truth , " Pelo said , and then he had run . And ever since then the noise had grown louder and with it had grown the need for The Band to know who was the leader so they could plan some kind of counteraction . " But suppose it is true , " Dr. Bara said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vittorini said . " In a war one does n't choose one 's enemies . If an insane mob has chosen Bombolini then we have no choice but to deal with the man the mob has chosen . " " Ah , well , " the doctor said , " we will soon find out who the leader is , whether we want to or not . " And Francucci began to weep again . " I want the priest . I want my priest . I want to make my last confession , " the baker said , and then some of the women began to weep as well . " Shut up and start acting like a man , " Copa shouted at him . " I do n't know how , " Francucci said . " He 's right though , " Vittorini said . " We need the priest . Every member of the fiancheggiatori must be united for the common defense . " The fiancheggiatori is the affiance of the Crown and the Vatican with the bureaucracy and big business which forms the traditional combination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fiancheggiatori satisfied and in balance with one another is said to hold the key to the kingdom . It was one of the postmaster 's favorite words , but as Babbaluche pointed out one day the only thing missing from the combination was the people . They sent a young boy into the piazza to go to the bell tower and summon the priest . " Tell him someone is dying , " Mazzola said . " That will be sure to bring him . " They put Francucci in a far corner of the cellar , in the deepest part of the darkness , but even from there he could be heard , saying it over and over like a litany in the church . " They are going to roll me in flour and sprinkle me with water . They are going to put me in an oven and bake me like my bread . " They are going to roll me in flour and sprinkle me with water . . . . "  | " No , I do n't believe it , " Mazzola was saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I refuse to believe it . No mob , even a mob from this city , would be insane enough to choose Bombolini for a leader . " " But Padre Polenta told them the same thing , and they were forced to believe it . " Yes , it 's true , " the priest said . " The people are cheering Bombolini . " " But why ? Why Bombolini ? " " It is in the nature of mobs to cheer fools , " the priest said . " Now where is the dying man ? " Doctor Bara waved his hand around the room . " Everywhere , " he said . " All of us . It is only a matter of time . " There was a great shout from the piazza then . The force of it was so strong they could feel its weight on the door . And each shout was followed by one after it and then another , like soldiers on the march . The shouts grew so loud and so steady that Francucci himself could no longer hear his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counting . Fabio had gotten Bombolini three quarters of the way down the pipe when the counting began . Someone in the piazza had counted the number of rungs that still remained and when there were fifty of them the people began to shout the number left . " Forty-nine . " " Forty-eight . " Great explosions of sound . The progress would come in flurries , four or five rungs , and when the two men got tired and held on , the people held the number and repeated it , over and over , until the men went on . " Forty-seven , forty-seven , forty-seven . . . " Like a steam engine waiting in the station . They had come to see Bombolini fall off the tower , but now the mood had changed . Now they were cheering him down . When there were only thirty-four or thirty-five spikes still to go , how-  | ever , with the end of the ordeal so near and yet with the distance still great enough so that if he slipped and fell he would die , Bornbolini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become like strands of wet pasta . They trembled and quivered , the strength had gone , he hung from the ropes on the pipe like a quarter of beef in the market place . What happened to Fabio then must be seen at least as having the hand of God behind it . He was coming back up the pipe to put Bombolini 's feet back on the spikes to keep him from being squeezed to death by the ropes when the grappa flask that he was carrying clinked against the pipe . He had forgotten about it , since Fabio does n't think in terms of alcohol ; but at the moment when he needed it , at a time truly of desperation , something caused the bottle to strike the metal . The grappa they distill here is strong . It can be used in a cigarette lighter or in a blowtorch . On a cold day it is like carrying around a bottle of live coals or putting a stove in your pocket . Fabio took the flask from his shirt and reached up , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fabio began pouring little surprises of grappa down his throat . The effect of the brandy was immediate . From the piazza they could see Bombolini 's vacant glazed stare pass from his face . His color , which had passed through purple into a whiteness like the whiteness of the dead , began to return to him . When Fabio got his feet back onto the spikes Bombolini was able to keep them there and the boy could feel muscles in the legs once more . " Give me the bottle , " Bombolini said . He began to pour the grappa down his own throat , steady strong swallows now , perhaps one a minute , an ounce or more each swallow and in five or six minutes the flask of grappa was emptied and he hurled it down into the piazza . He had drunk ten ounces of grappa in less than ten minutes . " We 're going down , " Bombolini shouted to Fabio . There was a great cheer from the people in the piazza . " Take off the ropes . " Fabio shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off himself , and when they were loose he threw them to the people and began to start down . He was slow , but he also was  | steady and careful , the foot feeling for the next spike , finding it , the whole body balanced correctly before the step and then the step itself . " Thirty-four , thirty-four , thirty-four . " Another step . " Thirty-three , thirty-three , thirty-three . " They could hear it all the way up the Corso Mussolini , they could hear it through the barred doors and the stones of the Leaders ' Mansion . They could hear it from every corner of the Piazza of the People , although they did n't know what it meant then . " It 's starting again , " Dr. Bara said in the cellar . " They 're getting ready to come again . It 's stronger now . " Dr. Bara had no fear for himself . It was his belief that the people would be too selfish to harm their only doctor . " You had better have a plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Vittorini said . He said it so vigorously that the feathers rustled and it was reassuring . " I will make him take our surrender . It is now a matter of timing , " the old soldier said . " Timing is all . " " And do n't allow ourselves to forget one thing , " Dr. Bara said . " The Italian soldier is a master at the art of surrender . " It made them feel better , all of them , and the feeling lasted until they heard a noise , the noise , one so strong that they felt it , the loudest noise almost certainly ever heard until then in Santa Vittoria. * * * He had gotten down , by himself , to the last spike on the pipe and then his feet had touched the stones of the Piazza Mussolini . At that moment there was a great cheer and he had fallen forward and they caught him before he hit the stones and began to carry him , to shove him actually , through the mass of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on a great solid twowheeled Sicilian cart , made of iron oak with oak wheels rimmed with iron , painted pink and blue and covered with sweet religious sayings , and when the hands released him he fell off and had to be caught once more and put back up onto the seat , where they  | propped him up so that he would n't fall again . It was at this time that he said the eight words that were the occasion for the greatest single sound in the history of the city . Before telling you the words , it is necessary to tell one thing about this place and the people who live in it . Life here is hard , harder than outsiders can ever see . No one gets anything here without working for it , and many work hard and get nothing . It sometimes seems in truth that the harder the people work the less they have to show for it , as if work creates loss . Who knows where the fault begins or where it lies ? The only truth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do they stay ? For the same reason that all peasants stay . They hold on to hunger , which they are accustomed to , because they are fearful of starvation . Because of this , the greatest fear of any peasant is that someone will take something from him that he has worked for . The pain of it is too unbearable . It is one reason all peasants are ungrateful . If someone gives a peasant something , he can only assume that it is a trick , or that the person does n't want the thing he has given , or that the person is crazy . All of this , then , is why the greatest joy of Italian peasants , and maybe peasants all over the world as well , is to get something they did n't work for : to get something for nothing . And the best things to get are the things that are sweated for each day . A pearl is good to get for nothing , but its value is n't known in terms of sweat . Pearls are good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shout , then ; this noise  --  now it can be understood . They put Fabio in the back of the cart and Bombolini was propped up in the high front seat and they began to push on the heavy wheels , back and forth at first to gain momentum to start the cart back up the Corso Mussolini , when he motioned to them . They did n't hear him clearly at first . " Say it once more , " a man shouted at him . " Clearly . " He made a last effort . He swallowed and cleared his throat and called out . " Free wine for the people of Santa Vittoria. "  | He slumped down in the seat , face forward , and it is doubtful if either he or Fabio ever heard the sound itself that greeted the words , although it soared up the Corso and it cascaded into the Piazza of the People and it thundered against the door of the Leader 's Mansion and it caused the stained-glass windows of Santa Maria of the Burning Oven to tremble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to get the cart moving , because not enough people could get behind it . But a crowd also has a will that makes itself felt , and just the sheer pressure of people , the desire of the crowd , seemed to be enough to start the cart moving upward . At the stone steps the men were forced to stop and rock the big iron-rimmed wheels back and forth to get up over the stones , and as they did they began shouting ? " Born " as they went forward , " bo " as they rolled back , " li-i-ii " as they strained up over the stone , and a short , explosive " ni " when they made it over the lip to the next step . The people behind the men pushing the cart took up the shout , and soon the Corso and then the whole of Santa Vittoria was vibrating with it . They could hear it in the highest part of High Town ? Born bo li-ii-i ni ! Born bo li-i-i-i ni ! " ? and over the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was watching oxen said it sounded like the start of a great storm and made her afraid , and Luigi Longo , who was coming back from another town after fixing a pump there , said it sounded like a trombone announcing the angel of death . * * * Vittorini had not been idle . In the Leaders ' Mansion they were ready for Bombolini . They stood behind the heavy oak door and listened to the shouts of the people and waited for the proper moment . The barricades had been pulled aside and the door was opened a crack to allow Vittorini to see into the Piazza of the People , and behind him were The Band . Copa stood just behind the old soldier with a medallion of the office of mayor held in his hand . Mazzola , behind Copa , held the great brass key to the city , which unlocks nothing here . Dr. Bara had put on a white coat and hung a stethoscope around his neck . Polenta , unfortunately , was dressed only in a soup-stained cassock , and on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stained with oil , but because he thought he had been coming to offer the last rites he had his tall silver crucifix and this would be important . The women had been sent through the Mansion and they had stripped it of every religious statue and holy picture the house possessed . Those who had no picture or soapstone saint were given a baby or young child to hold in their arms . Vittorini himself had taken the Italian flag from a hallway and had worked the flag down the edge of his sword , so that it hung like a banner when the blade was extended . " Open it just a little wider , " Vittorini said . The sound coming up into the piazza from the Corso was deafening . The soldier was at military attention . " The timing is everything now , " he called to the doctor , but Dr. Bara was unable to hear him . * * * Before anything else , they saw Bombolini 's head rise from the Corso Mussolini , up toward the piazza , and then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the Sicilian cart and finally as the cart came up into the Piazza of the People , they saw the bodies of the people pushing him . " My God , " Dr. Bara said . " He comes like a king from the East . " He was above them all , riding along above them , swaying back and forth above them , as if he were floating on a restless sea . The people were still shouting his name , and they came flooding out of the confines of the Corso , spilling out into the vastness of the piazza and around Bombolini and the cart , like the first wave of a tide . Someone in the Leaders ' Mansion moved toward the door then , but Vittorini held him back . " Not yet , not yet , " he shouted . The cart had no direction . Once out of the Corso , it had gotten out of the control of the men who had been pushing it . It rolled out into the center of the piazza , propelled there by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn to the left in the direction of the wineshop and away from the Mansion of the Leaders ,  | but the men pushing the wheels were unable to make the turn , because of the press behind them , and the cart continued out toward the Fountain of the Pissing Turtle . " Now ! " Vittorini commanded . The door of the Leaders ' Mansion was thrown wide open . The old soldier was the first to go through it , his sword pointed directly out in front of him with the flag fluttering in the wind that blows every evening in this city . Ccpa came behind him , the imitaton gold of the mayor 's medallion glinting in what still remained of the sun . Mazzola held up the key to the city of Santa Vittoria . After him came Dr. Bara , and with Bara was Padre Polenta with the silver crucifix held aloft for everyone in the piazza to see , and then came the women holding up the statues and the holy pictures and the old and young women with the babies held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vittorini shouted again . He lifted up his sword so that the flag was overhead , the priest lifted up his crucifix and began to wave it up and down . Mazzola waved the key , and Copa flung the medallion up and down , and all the pictures and all the statues and all the babies waved up and down . Nothing happened . The cart continued out into the piazza . Allow this much for Copa . He is a man of action , and action was required . " The sons of bitches , " he shouted to Vittorini . " They try to ignore our surrender . " He ran back into the Mansion and when he came outside again with the gun , the cart was no more than ten feet away from the fountain . He unloaded his first shot from the double-barreled shotgun over the crowd in the piazza and the second was even lower , so low that several people were cut and stung by the bird shot . The movement in the piazza stopped , the pushing ceased , the pressure on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gun . One went over the heads of the people in the back of the crowd and in the silence the explosion sounded much louder . The other he fired into the bell tower and the pellets caused the bell to go piing and ping and  | cling and then the bell itself to rock lightly back and forth with the clapper just touching the brass and sounding a mournful blung , biting that we use on the days of death . " Once more , " Vittorini said , and all of the pictures and the medallions and the sacred cross and the babes started to rise and fall again . And allow this much for Bombolini . Although he was drunk and exhaustion had stolen much of his sensibility , it was he  --  of all the people in the piazza standing there with their mouths agape looking at the smoke curling from the end of Copa 's gun and watching the wind ripple the feathers of Vittorini 's hat and Vittorini 's flag  --  who knew at once what was taking place . There is a line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carries with him . Fortune is a woman . It is necessary , if you wish to master her , to take her by force before she has a chance to resist . Give this much for Bombolini , then . He saw his fortune and he raped her on the spot . " To the Leaders ' Mansion , " he called . There was a moment when it seemed that the marriage might never be consummated . The will of the crowd was for wine . But the people had a decency about them , they were willing to wait for their wine and with a great effort , with an agonizing slowness , the cart was turned and the people in its path were pushed aside , and Bombolini and the Sicilian cart began to bounce along the cobblestones of the piazza in the direction of the Leaders ' Mansion . It was his determination to say something memorable to seize the occasion , but he never had the chance to open his mouth . " By the powers vested in me by the legitimate government of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , like that of all good soldiers , was loud and carried command . What Dr. Bara had said about the Italian soldiers and surrender was correct . Vittorini and the rest of them were impressive in defeat . The old soldier talked for almost one half hour without , as anyone could notice , taking a breath . Since they did n't understand the purpose of the talk , the people in the piazza did n't understand the words , but they liked to hear them because they were beauti-  | ful and Vittorini was full of eloquence and his sentences flowed like rivers and his words glided like swans on still waters . It is not necessary to put down all the details . It is enough to know this : that in exchange for a sacred and a solemn vow by Bombolini that the persons and the property of those who had gone before  --  which meant The Band  --  would be respected , he , talc ) Bombolini , would be handed the key to the city and the medallion of the mayor would be placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacred and solemn vow ? " Vittorini said . " Remember , it is witnessed by the priest and thus by God Himself . " Someone prodded Bombolini . " You so have my solemn pledge , " Bombolini said . Vittorini turned directly toward the people in the piazza then . While Polenta sanctified the pledge by making the sign of the cross , Vittorini lifted his sword and the flag . " Citizens of Santa Vittoria , " he cried out to them . " I give you your new leader . " There was almost no response from the people . They had not understood , and it still was not clear to them . What response there was  --  a few cheers and a few groans , a shout of laughter from Babbaluche , the sound of snoring from Fabio in the back of the cart  --  soon died away in the rush of the late afternoon wind and finally the only sound at all was that of Vittorini 's flag fluttering . It was beginning to grow dark in the piazza , although the sun was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vittorini made a small sign with his hand ; he turned it upward as if to say to Bombolini , " I have done my job , the rest is up to you , " and Dr. Bara pushed up behind the soldier . " Get the medallion , " he said . " They do n't want him . Get the medallion back . We have made a terrible mistake . " But at that moment Bara was proven wrong . Bombolini had turned around on the cart and back to his people and had said something to them , and this was followed by an enormous cheer and a great surge of movement . Vittorini turned to Bara . " And what would you call that ? " Men seized the great cart wheels . They almost lifted that iron oak cart into the air in their eagerness to turn it around and drive it back across the piazza.  | " And what would you call that if he is n't the leader ? " Vittorini said . " They would have torn us apart . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Padre Polenta began to walk back across the clearing piazza to the bell tower . The others turned around and started back inside the Leaders ' Mansion , because one of the promises Vittorini had made was that they would be out of the Mansion by sundown that evening . The wine seller had said four words : " And now your wine . " * * * When Rosa Bombolini heard the sounds coming up the Corso Mussolini she had shut the shutters of her windows and run downstairs and closed and locked the iron gate that guards the front of the wineshop and then gone back upstairs and stood behind the shutters , where she could see into the Piazza of the People without being seen . Her husband 's cart came to a stop twenty feet from the wineshop . " Open the gates , " Bombolini shouted . When there was no answer , someone handed Bombolini a cobblestone that had been pried out of the piazza . Bombolini gave the stone to one of the younger Pietrosantos and made a sign , and the young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Open the gates , " he shouted again . The shutter opened this time and his wife looked down from the window into the cart . " I open no gates to no mob , " Rosa Bombolini shouted to them . " This is no mob . These are the citizens of Santa Vittoria , " Bornbolini called back . She made a gesture with the fingers of her right hand that only men ever make here and then only when they are among men . " I order you to open these gates , " Bombolini called . " Order ? " She made that laugh that all Santa Vittoria is familiar with , the one they are afraid of . " Whose order ? " The words were spit on her lips . " The order of the mayor of the city of Santa Vittoria . " He held up the key to the city and then the medallion of the  | office of mayor , and the people cheered . She opened the shutters wide then . " Up the fat you-know-what of the indescribable mayor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayor looked very tired then and sad . He pointed to the gates . " Down , " he said . He described the action with his hands . " Pull them down . " She was at the window again . " You son of a bitch . I own this house . I own this wineshop . You listen to me . You touch those gates and you never walk into this house again . " It would be his first decision as mayor . He did n't look up at her when he made it , but the decision was made . " Down , " he ordered . " Take them down . " It was the Sicilian cart that did the job . They lifted Bombolini clown from the cart and then they ran it back and forth to build up the proper rage , like a bull preparing to make his charge , and all at once they released it . The gate was no match for the cart . The iron was old and the hinges and bolts that held it were rusted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front door gave , and then the entire front of the wineshop . The plate-glass window came all apart and it shattered into the shop and into the piazza . The reign of Italo Bombolini had begun .  | IT WOULD BE gratifying to be able to write that the Peo ? ple of Santa Vittoria acted in some other way than they did that night . But the people acted like proper Santa Vittorians and like people getting something for nothing . Because the wine was free , everyone drank too much , and drunkenness and greed are never gratifying . Someone set fire to a goat and it went blazing down the Corso Mussolini and nearly set fire to a stall . Someone threw a bottle from a roof and cut someone . It was not all bad . Some of the young people had accordions and a shepherd came down from the high pastures with pipes , and although they do n't dance here often the men danced and then the women and finally even the men with the women .  | 1 There was an omen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a time calmed the people . While the first barrel of wine was being drunk , just after the sun had gone down , a strange early evening star was seen glittering to the north and east of the city . It hung up above the mountains there , shining in the gold of the late sun before dipping down into the shadows of the mountains . Everyone agreed it was a good sign . " That bastard Bombolini 's in luck , " someone said . " Someone is looking out for him . " If the harvest was good this year , for years to come people would look into the sky on this day to see the good omen again and announce that there would be another good harvest . If someone died , his family would look for the star on this day in fear that they would see it and someone else would die that year . But the star was forgotten , that night at least , when the second barrel was opened . No one at the end was sure how much wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk . It is a lot of wine for one thousand people , when many of them are very old and very young and over half of them are women . Long before midnight the dancing stopped . No matter how much wine was drunk the people would be down on the terraces in the morning when the sun rose . Only the young men were still up . A team of Turtles was playing a kind of soccer game with a team of Goats in the piazza , but even that was quiet and slow . One of the players found Fabio sleeping on the wet stones by the Fountain of the Pissing Turtle . " You 'd better get up , " he told him , " or you 'll die in the night air . " " I have no place to go , " Fabio said . He was more tired than drunk . The soccer player pointed him in the direction of the Leaders ' Mansion . " There 's room for you in there . Bombolini is living there now . His wife has thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the door . There was a light inside the house . He knocked , very lightly , and when no one answered he tried the door and it opened and he went inside .  | He was surprised to see Bombolini sitting on a box , with a tallow candle by his side , and reading a book . He wanted to say something but could not think of the right thing , and he continued across the room until he was behind the mayor . The book was old and grimy . It had been abused by use and time . Lines of the text were underlined , and some of them were underlined two and three times , and some of these were in different colors , with all kinds of notes written in the margin . One read : " No , not true in Santa Vittoria . " Others Fabio could see said , " How very true " and " Try and tell that to the Fascists . " " Oh , " Bombolini said . He closed the book . " I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Fabio came around in front of the new mayor . " You were reading your Machiavelli . " " I 'm going to need him now . He 's going to have to tell me what to do . " Fabio sat down on a large wooden bench , one of the pieces the Band had left behind . " I want to stay here for the night if I may . " " Fabio . You may stay here for the rest of your life , " Bombolini said . " No . Just for the night . I am very tired . " Bombolini picked up the light and took Fabio upstairs to a room where several blankets and an old coat were stretched out on the floor . " I want you to take my bed , " he said , and when Fabio refused he forced him to lie down on it and went away with the light . Fabio has no idea how long he was there before the mayor returned . " Fabio ? Are you awake ? Listen to this . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand with one finger extended , a gesture Fabio was to recognize later as the sign that Bombolini was about to quote from Machiavelli . " The wise ruler ought never to keep faith when by doing so it would be against his interests ! ' " Fabio sat up . " Who says that ? "  | " The Master , " Bombolini said . " The wise fox , Niccola Machiavelli . " " Why are you asking me ? " " Do I have to keep those promises I made ? " " You gave your word , " Fabio said . " Your sacred word . " Bombolini closed the book with a loud noise . " I knew I should have asked Babbaluche , " he said . There was darkness , and Fabio slept . But when he woke again there was a light in the room once more . " Just one other sentence , Fabio . An interpretation . " The mayor held up his hand . " ' Men must be either caressed or annihilated . They will revenge themselves for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great ones . The harm the leader does must be such that he need not fear revenge . ' What do you make of that ? " Fabio did not want to be part of any bloodletting , but he was tired and the words seemed to have only one meaning . " I think it means you 're supposed to kill them . " Bombolini thought about that for a while , and before he said anything else Fabio was asleep . " I think you are right , " he said sadly , because he had little stomach for blood and at the same time a respect for the words of The Master . The next time Fabio awoke , the room was light again , but this time the light came from the piazza . He had been able to sleep for several hours , and he felt better because of it . " Fabio della Romagna , I want you to join my cabinet , " Bombolini said to him . " I want you to be a minister in the Grand Council of the Free City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fabio said , and it was the truth . " I am proud you ask me , but my place is in Montefalcone . I have to finish my studies at the academy . It would not be good to quit now . " " Just for the emergency , " Bombolini said . " For the duration . I need you . I need educated men . That 's what you will be , Minister of Education . No . Minister for Advanced Education . You can live right here . We 'll get a bed for you and a desk , and Angela will bring us something in the morning and make us supper at night . It wo n't be bad . " It was the thunderbolt again . It was all at once the most amazing idea that Fabio had ever heard  --  Angela carrying his breakfast ;  | Angela meeting in doorways , saying good morning and saying good night ; Angela preparing food for him with her own hands ; Angela meeting him by error and design and chance in all those personal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone in a house . " I do n't know , " Fabio said . He could barely bring himself to talk . " Everything will be upset in Montefalcone . You said the Germans were taking over the town . " " Yes . " " Then I can put you down , " Bombolini said . He took out a soiled card from his pocket and at the bottom added Fabio 's name to the list of names . The card was old and the names on it were old and only Fabio 's looked freshly placed on the card , and he realized with a start almost as strong as the one he had felt before that this man , whom they had for months and perhaps years been walking about with a fully formed government in his pocket . Bombolini closed the shutters and it was dark in the room once more . " You should sleep , " he said . " But before you do I want you to think about this so you can think about it while you sleep . The Master says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . One way or the other . I want you to think about the course I should follow . " When Fabio awoke the sun was fully up and the old blankets were hot against his skin . He thought about the night , the wine , the dancing  --  which he had n't done , although he had looked at others dance with her  --  the strange star in the sky , an omen for good or evil , and about the new thing , Angela and himself in this house and about something Bombolini had asked him to think about and which he had forgotten . He lay on the floor and became conscious of a strange sound coming from the piazza , a tinkling of glass , as if a river of glass were running across the piazza stones . When he looked out of the window he could see a group of old men and women with longhandled brush brooms sweeping the streets and the piazzas ,  | sweeping up the broken glass of the night before . Such a thing had never happened before in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare rains washed . He was still watching the work with admiration when Bombolini came into the room , clean now and refreshed , although he could not have slept . " The Public Works Corps , " he said . " I stole the idea from the Fascists . " " But how do you pay them ? " Bombolini smiled broadly and handed Fabio a square piece of paper . 3 THREE 3 SANTA VITTORIA LIRE This paper redeemable for legal currency at the end of the emergency Italo Bombolini Mayor The Free City of Santa Vittoria " Do you really intend to honor it ? " Fabio asked . Bombolini was shocked by the suggestion . " You can fool the people about many things , but only a fool would be foolish enough to fool the people about money . " " The Master , " Fabio said . " I 'm getting to recognize him . " It was clear that the mayor was very flattered . " In truth , Fabio , it was myself , " he said . Fabio was impressed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In truth , Fabio , I do n't write that well . If someone else could write them down ... " It was in this manner that The Discourses of Italo Bombolini came into being . There are still several copies in Fabio 's hand somewhere in the city . " The people are saying we were born under a lucky star . A good omen , a good sign . I hope they are right . "  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | that we might have crossed almost directly over Santa Vittoria at eight o'clock that morning , although no one here recalls a plane passing over that morning . I already knew the fate of Mussolini . The pilot of the Odessa Darling , Captain Buster Rampey , had told me about it before we took off that morning . " They kicked out that Muzzlini , you know that ? What do you think about it ? " I shrugged my shoulders . I thought nothing about it . " I just thought you might want to know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be the first to know , you know ? You bein ' Eyetalian and all like that . " " No , sir . " " I just thought you would . " " No , sir . " It was our fourth mission , and the first over the mainland of Italy . We had bombed Pantelleria and Lampedusa and some other island I have forgotten , but this was to be the first flight over Italy . I recall the beginning of the flight very well , because every once in a while , when I feel trapped here on this mountain like a sailor in a small boat at sea , I feel like flying again , to get out of here , up above all these people I have come to know so well and who think they know me so well . We crossed the sea , the Tyrrhenian Sea , early that morning . We flew with the sun , flying low over the blue-green water and the shadow ran along the top of the water like some great dark fish coursing just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came upon us , a surprise from the water , all green , so different from Africa , darkly green like the underside of grape leaves . We followed the coast , what I now know is called the Divine Coast , rushing along over the cliffs and the white houses clinging to the cliffs and the little towns strung along their steep sides and somewhere we suddenly turned in over the mainland . After that I did n't look at the land much , because my aim was to see and to shoot an Italian plane . The reason for this was that the other members of the Odessa Darling did n't trust me . One night after  | he had been drinking in the Officer 's Club Captain Rampey came and found me in my barracks . " Tell me one thing true , Abrussi . If you was to see an Eyetalian plane in the air you would n't fire on it , would you ? " I told him that I would . He pronounced the word " fire " as far and although I have forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the captain said to me and the way that he said them . " You do n't have to lie about it , Abrussi . I wo n't hold that against you . You think if my people left Texas and some war came up that I would go back and shoot at Texas people ? " I said that I thought he would if he were ordered to do it . He gripped me by the front of my shirt . " Shoot my brothers ? Shoot at my flesh and blood ? " He let go of my shirt in disgust . " I just wish you would be honest about it . Then I might be able to respect you . " After that I was accepted by the rest of the crew as a built-in handicap , like an engine that never functioned right . They even had a plan for me called Plan Paisan , in case of an attack by Italian planes . Lieutenant Marvell was to leave his post as navigator and to man my machine gun . There was nothing personal about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them wrong . If planes were sighted I wanted to fire at them and hit them before Marvell could relieve me of my weapon . Then some time that morning , while passing over a patch of dark pine woods , the Odessa Darling flew into a grove of budding flak  --  puffs of black smoke and little flowerings of metal . The sky bloomed with them . I had thought we were through this dangerous garden and all of the bursts were behind us , when the plane leaped in the air as if it were suffering a convulsion . The plane shuddered and we started down all at once , in one great sudden dip , as if someone had pulled a plug in the sky . " Please Jesus , do n't let there be fire , " someone said . At the end of the drop the plane began to skid through the sky , slipping across it as if we were being towed on a wire cable , going  | down but across the sky at the same moment , and then there was a thudding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were brushing the tops of trees or mountains and then we held , the plane had gotten a hold of the sky again . He was a good pilot . It is strange now to think that 1 owe my life to Captain Rampey . For a long time we flew in silence , trying only to hold the plane in the sky , fearful of trying to turn or to even lift the plane . We flew on , low , and the mountain towns came floating up at us and then faded away like islands in a high green sea . After a period of time  --  how long it was I could n't say or even guess  --  we began to edge up in the sky again and much later Captain Rampey began to make the turn back again , to wheel the Odessa Darling around in a huge slow arc in the sky . There was no talking . We listened to the strange sounds we were making , they frightened us , and then Rampey called to Marvell . " I want you to pick me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One directly on the line to home . " I could see Lieutenant Marvell checking his maps from where I stood at my post . He was a careful worker . " I got you one , " he said after a while . " We wo n't even have to bank for it . Name of . . . name of ... " " I do n't want to know the name , " the captain said . " Just tell me before we get there . " " Yes , sir . " " We did n't come this far for nothing . " " No , sir . " " Got to ditch these bombs some place . " " Yes , sir . " " Do n't want to waste the whole Goddamn day . " " Would n't do , sir . " " Would n't do at all . " We could see people along the roads , and I could even see the dust rising behind the carts when the oxen put their feet down . Some of the people waved to us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would ever tell the people the way their town had been chosen .  | They probably think it was an act of God or an act of War ; it would n't do them any good to know . When we were five minutes from the target area Lieutenant Marvell announced that it was time to begin to ease the Odessa Darling down . " I do n't see anything , " Captain Rampey said . " It 's just on the other side of that mountain , " Marvell said . " You would n't trick me , " Rampey said . " Sir ! " The Odessa Darling started down . " Going to get us some paisans today . " It was a good-sized town , a city really , about three or four times the size of Santa Vittoria . It was on the other side of the mountain , but on a smaller mountain of its own , below the taller mountain , and it covered the crest of it , all white and orange tiles , ringed by a wall , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crest of the mountain . Going down on all sides of the mountain were the dark-green fields that I later came to know as terraced vineyards from my experience here . In the center of all this greenness , circled by its wall , from the air the city looked like the bull's-eye on an enormous dart board . " Marvell ? " " Sir ? " " You picked us a jewel , hear ? " There was trouble with the doors of the bomb bay ; some of the flak had damaged the mechanism that controlled them . The bombardier tried to work them open , but before he succeeded we were already over the city . " I can get you a target further down the line , " Marvell said . " No , I want this one , " Rampey said . They unscrewed the barrel of my machine gun and began to use it as a lever to pry the doors open . We were low then , and I could see the city clearly . The piazza was crowded with people and stalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . At one end of the piazza was a large building , much like here , that I took to be the town hall . At the other end stood the tower of the cathedral of the city .  | " There 's your aiming stake , " Captain Rampey said . The shadow of the Odessa Darling slid over the town , across the wall and over the piazza and the church facade , over the orange roofs , turning them for a moment a dark red , and then over the other wall , like a dark messenger . We have a saying in Santa Vittoria : " Good is recognized only when it goes away , evil when it comes . " But , in this case at least , it was n't true . When the shadow crossed over them the people looked up ; some just went back to their work and some of them waved to us . When the bomb bay doors opened the Odessa Darling swung around and came back for the town . Captain Rampey did n't wait for the cathedral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls he said , " Kick ' em on out , " and all of us became bombardiers . We rolled the bombs through the door and pushed them through and kicked them out with our feet , and they began to follow each other down upon the city , wig-wagging back and forth the way the bombs do , swimming along after each other like fish in a school . You try to follow the bomb that you personally sent on its way , one that felt the touch of your hand or your foot , and you think that you do ; but when the explosions begin and the stones and the roofs and then the fire and the smoke begin to erupt you realize that you will never be able to tell exactly what you have done . We were low enough to see the confused game the people in the piazza were playing . At each explosion  --  the explosions seemed to walk across the town with giant strides toward the piazza  --  the people would run in one direction , and at the next they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just left . Eventually they must have found their heads , because the second time we turned and came back over the city the people in the piazza were gone . In all of the piazza there was just one man and he was kneeling in the center of it working the bolt of a hand operated rifle and aiming it at the Odessa Darling . " That son of a bitch could hurt someone , " Marvell said . This was the run on which the Soo-pound delayed-action demolition bomb would be used . This is the heart and even the very soul of the Odessa Darling .  | " You have it ready and I 'll tell you when , " Captain Rampey told the bombardier . He was an expert at this , a genius at it perhaps , the owner of a very special talent that God had given him and which could be used only once or twice in a lifetime . If it had n't been for war Rampey might never had known he possessed it . " Now , " he said ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a moment it seemed to fly along with the Odessa Darling before arching over the town and suddenly dipping down , and as it did , every one of us , even the ones without the fine instinct of Captain Rampey , could see that it was going to be a success . It appeared when it reached it to just touch the gray slate roof of the cathedral and then to go through it so swiftly that the hole it made in the roof seemed to close behind it the way water does over a rock . It was a delayed-action bomb and with a bomb such as this there is always the fear that it might not explode , but then this one did , somewhere down among the dark cellars and in the foundation where a great many people from the piazza must have been hiding . The first sign of success was not the noise of the explosion or the sensation of pressure from it that can at times lift a plane into the air and drop it down like a boat when a wave runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cathedral , the entire facade , the great circular stained-glass window that had once been the front of the cathedral , coming apart all at once , every piece seeming to come apart at the same instant and flowering out onto the stones of the piazza . After that , the fire began , a spurt of flame from the bowels of the church that took a great part of the slate roof with it , and then the sound , so that when we began to pull up only the far walls of the cathedral still stood . The man with the rifle was gone . " There 's only the small bombs left , " Marvell said . " Let 's not waste them , " the captain said . The center of the city was flaming and hidden in smoke when we made our turn , but the far ends of the town were still not touched ; so it was decided to begin to drop the small bombs on the terraces down below the city wall so that we would be sure this way to hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wall and some of them were even running along the top , and when the first of the bombs began landing down in the vine-  | yards some of the people jumped down from the walls and began running in the direction of the bombs . They did n't seem to know what to do with themselves . An ox pulling a cart went mad with fear and began running down over the terraced walls until it must have broken its legs and the cart it was pulling landed on top of it . " Someone ought to put that thing out of its misery , " Lieutenant Marvell said . In one part of the city , out along the north walls , was an open rectangular patch of green , a different green from any that we had seen , a lighter green , more even and much brighter than the darker green of the grapevines , and as we came up on it I could see that it was a playing field and that the large red-tiled building next to the field was almost certainly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and a woman standing far apart from one another ; in between them , at regular intervals , were little dark stripes stretched out on the grass . There were white lines on the field , I suppose for soccer , and at first I thought the dark lines were some kind of markers for the game , but as we came on them I could see that they were children . The bombs were beginning to come up the terraces by then and the first of them were even reaching the walls , but the man and the woman still stood in the field and none of the children moved . I suppose the man and the woman thought it would frighten the children if they were to get down on the grass with them . When the bombs came nearer the children began to curl up , and in their black school uniforms they looked like little balls of soot rolled up on the bright-green grass . The sticks of bombs , the ones that might reach them , were already in the air , but I began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner . The children in the playing field must have trusted their teachers , because although the noise must have been getting terribly loud and frightening none of them moved ; they stayed exactly where they had been placed , out on the grass ; and it was right , because it is much safer to be out in the open than crouched under a school desk where one might be buried under the old beams and stones of the school and trapped there in fire . But I still have this feeling , about the bravery of their teachers and the bravery of the children . If only they had looked up they  | might have seen the line of black things dropping and been able to get up and run to one side of the field away from them . But they stayed where they had been told to stay , face down on the playground , never moving at all until the first of the bombs landed among them , and even after the second and the third , when the bright-green grass began to fling up into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flame of the bomb and the dark little balls of soot . A soldier does his duty , and this was my duty . And I think now that I might have been spared some of the pain , had it not been for the boy . When the bombs had stopped , I could see him running across the grass to what still remained of the school gate and I could see that his clothes were on fire and that the boy was burning . Even from where we were I could see that he held something white in his arms and I knew at once that it was important to know what it was . What can be so important for a boy to refuse to drop when he is burning . It is this that makes me wake up some nights and find that I am crying out to drop it and I find my arms are striking out and I am trying to put out the flames with my hands . The street outside the school was wide and there was no one in it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was impossible not to follow the boy . The street was steep , but instead of running down it he began to run up the street , and so I know that he must have been trying to reach his home and whoever took care of him there . He did n't run far . After a few steps he went down to his knees and he seemed to stay that way for a long time , although it was probably a very short time , I hope only a moment , before he fell , face forward , onto the stones of the street ; and as he did , the white thing that he was holding was freed and it began to roll and then to bounce its way back down the steepness of the street . It was his soccer ball , and it continued to bounce and roll away from him long after the boy had stopped burning and we had begun to pull up from the city to avoid the pillar of fire and smoke that was rising from it . But I could still see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way the sun will burn there for minutes after you have looked at it , and then even that ceased and we had banked up and away from there and were headed back for Africa .  | " That concludes the program for the afternoon , " Captain Rampey said . The shadow of the plane was leaping over the green fields , and behind us the city was burning like a crown set afire . " I will tell you one thing , " Marvell said . " We did us a job of work . " Those were the last words that I remember hearing on the Odessa Darling . I have no recollection beyond that , but I must have done all the things that must be done to cut oneself loose from an airplane , as complicated as cutting the umbilical cord that ties the baby to its mother . I have no recollection at all of stepping out through the bomb bay doors or of pulling the rip cord on my parachute because at that moment I had no desire to do it . My first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the late afternoon sun glowing in the white nylon of my canopy as if I were hung to a silken lantern , and it must have been this that caused me to glitter in Santa Vittoria , far to the south of me then , like a star or an omen in the evening . I was happy at that time , sometimes it seems to me like the happiest moment of my life and I do n't know why . At other times I see it as the saddest , because it cut me loose from myself , perhaps forever . I dropped out of the sun into the shadow of the mountains to the north of me , and it was cold , and the gold of the canopy turned to a whitish blue , and then I struck the terraced side of a mountain that was no longer farmed . The earth was hard , the earth was clay and rocks , and when I hit it I heard a bone snap in my leg and a little later I felt it . The cooling air of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be dragged down and across the old terraces until I finally became caught in some old vines and was held there by them . I pulled the parachute around me and made a nest for myself as a wounded animal would do . Later , in the night , I was wakened by some small dark men who smelled of manure and wine . They said nothing to me . They lifted me up and put me in a large basket that stank of earth and manure and grape mold and they put the basket on the back of a mule and took me back up the mountain I had landed on . I thought they were going to kill me , and I did n't care then . I was  | in great pain . I was now a deserter . I was alone . Of all the Americans I knew I had for some reason declared my personal end to the war and I was ashamed of myself . Who was I , to have attornpted such a thing ? The arrogance of my act overwhelmed me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would see the burning boy . As I look back on it now , there was very little reason to wonder why I wanted to die . They kept me in a little hut made of branches and twigs and straw , out in the middle of a field . I have no idea for how long . They fed me some kind of white runny goat cheese and hard bread and bitter olives and wine , and if it had n't been for the wine I think I would have starved to death . One night they came and got me and put me in the basket again and toward morning , when I could stand it no longer , I heard the clop of the mule 's hoofs on stone , and looking up from the basket I could see the roofs of houses and I knew I was in some sort of town . They dumped me here then , in the shredded old grape basket , in the Piazza of the People at the door of the Leaders ' Mansion . Italo Bombolini was mayor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had already been mayor for several weeks by then and perhaps for longer .  | From The Discourses of Italo Bombolini . The duty of the people is to tend to their own affairs . The duty of government is to help them do it . This is the pasta of politics The inspired leader , the true prince , no matter how great , can only be sauce upon the pasta . ? Bombolini J1lwo WEEKS after Italo Bombolini had taken over as mayor of Santa Vittoria , everyone  --  with the exception of the priest Polenta , who despised him , and the cobbler Babbaluche , who was n't prepared to see him as he was  --  recognized one thing about him . Bombolini was a leader ; he was a born leader , he was a natural leader . He was , at times , an inspired leader . He was , in his own words , " sauce upon the pasta . " His leadership was so natural and he seized power with such grace that people who only several weeks before could not say his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " fool " began to realize they had seen these traits of leadership in Bombolini all along . " Do you remember the time he kept Giovanetti from killing his  | wife by talking to him and getting the pick out of his hand ? I said to myself right then He may look like a clown , but here is the soul of the leader , ' I said . I can say this much : I was one of the first to recognize it . " Everyone had his own way of discovering Bombolini . In the end even Babbaluche was forced to admit that the wine seller possessed certain qualities that were surprising at least . " But they wo n't last , " the cobbler would say . " He 's running on nerve and luck alone . You watch . Somewhere inside that fat bastard a clown lives , and sooner or later the clown will come out , because a clown is a clown and will always be a clown . " There were others , some of the old men who no longer believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . " He 'll stop running , " they said  --  there is a saying here : An ass 's trot does n't last long  --  but when Bombolini continued to run even the old men began to turn on Babbaluche . " The ass is still running , " one of them shouted at the cobbler . " Maybe this ass is a horse . " " An ass is an ass and will always act like an ass , " Babbaluche said . " You wait . You 'll see his long ears soon enough . " * * * From his first day Bombolini seemed to have a feeling for the correct thing to do . The day after Vittorini had handed him the mayor 's medallion a group of citizens went across the piazza to the Leaders ' Mansion to ask Bombolini to surrender the office and put someone in it who would n't ruin the city . " All right , Italo , " they wanted to say to him , in all kindness , " the fun is over now ; we 've all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get ourselves a leader . " But they did n't find Bombolini home that day . They could n't find him any place . When they finally went down to the terraces to tend their grapes Bombolini came out of hiding to tend to the town . He had the streets swept . He had the fountain repaired and the water-catch cleaned of all its mold and moss and all the old glass and potato peelings that washed around in it cleaned out and thrown away . The third morning , the people woke up and found  | that all the old slogans in Santa Vittoria had been changed in the night . The one in the Piazza of the People that read BELIEVE OBEY FIGHT had been changed to TRANQUILLITY CALMNESS PATIENCE The three great virtues of the Italian people A public service ( Signed ) Italo Bombolini , Mayor On the old fallen wall of the Chapel of the Bountiful Grapes the old Fascist party slogan " I Do n't Give a Damn " now read WE CARE In High Town where for years the sign had read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAREFULLY ? Bombolini Although there were no cars in Santa Vittoria then , it gave the people a feeling of belonging with the times . As you went down the Corso Mussolini it had been impossible to avoid the sign on the wall of the house where the Corso curves down to the left : BETTER TO LIVE ONE DAY AS A LION THAN 100 YEARS AS A LAMB Today when you go down the Corso you read BETTER TO LIVE 100 YEARS ? Bombolini , Mayor After the third day , the group of men who had wanted Bombolini 's resignation no longer tried to see him , and he began to show himself in the streets .  | It is impossible now to know whether the things the wine seller did came to him from study and thought , or whether they were the reactions of instinct . It does n't really matter . The important point is that he did them . The trouble with government in this country is that it is composed of the Ins and the Outs . There are blacks and whites , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they kick all the Ins out , and the new Outs do everything in their power to destroy the programs of the Ins , even when they might help them . It is brutal and sometimes bloody and almost always exciting and usually no good for the town , but that is the way it always has been . Bombolini 's genius , for that is what it must be seen as now , was that instead of throwing people out he invited everyone in . He formed the Grand Council of the Free City of Santa Vittoria and in two days every faction that could be counted upon to be fighting one another , every family and every force in the city , had a member in the government . Everyone was an In or had a member of the family who was an In . Membership in the Council was almost evenly divided among Frogs and Turtles and Goats . Half of the members were young , and half of them were old , and every one of the large or powerful families was represented . The real secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because that was not possible , almost no one was Out . Giovanni Pietrosanto was made Minister of Public Waters , which meant that he was in charge of the fountain and the water tower . Under Giovanni 's direction the spillways were cleared and the pump was put back in working order by Longo , and all the drains on the terraces were cleared and patched , and for the first time in twenty years there was water on the terraces for the grapevines . It is n't a great deal of water , but it is enough to keep a dry spell from becoming a drought , something that Someone greater than Bombolini had not seen fit to do . Under his brother Pietro , the other powerful member of the family , the organization called Minute Men of Santa Vittoria was formed . " Why do you want to waste your time on this ? " Fabio asked Bombolini . The mayor held up his hand . " ' The chief foundations of all  | states are good laws and good arms . ' I have no say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an army . " At the start people laughed at the army , but as they drilled in the Piazza of the People after work and the twenty men got better at their drill , the people began to turn out to watch them . Pietrosante has a voice that can break windows , and the drill was impressive . Every soldier was allowed to wear a red arm band on Sunday and to sport a hawk 's feather in his hat , and soon every young man in Santa Vittoria was hungry for a feather , but the army was held to twenty because that was the number of weapons we had . There were others . Commissioner of Sanitation , Master of the Scales , Minister for Bread and Pasta , Minister for Advanced Education , Minister for Affairs of the Aged . He closed the second meeting of the Grand Council with these words . " A wise man once said , The first impression one gets of a new ruler and his brains is from seeing the men he has chosen to have around him ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vittoria . By these standards I submit that I must be judged a genius . " At first they felt that Bombolini was being egotistical , but as they went home and the words rolled around in their heads and they began to see what they meant , they were , of course , flattered . And as Bombolini had told Fabio , if you ca n't buy your way by money the next best way is to buy your way with flattery , because as every Italian knows , flattery will always get you somewhere . There were mistakes . One morning Bombolini decided to please the people by bringing democracy to the water fountain . For several hundred years , for reasons no longer known , several families had had the right to go to the head of the line waiting for water at the fountain and to fill their jugs first . One morning the women found this sign on the fountain . In The Eyes of God There Are No Preferred People . First Come , First Served . Order of Bombolini , Mayor The proclamations were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Caesars . The experiment in democracy went well until Rosa Bombolini came across the piazza with her seven-  | gallon aluminum jug , modern and progressive , the only one of its kind in Santa Vittoria , and went to the head of the line as was her privilege . Pietro Pietrosanto , as head of the army , was in charge of the new policy that morning . " Back , " he told her . " To the end of the line . You know the order . " " I know my rights , " she shouted . She pushed against Pietrosanto with her large and powerful chest . " You go tell him this . Tell him that no fat-ass Sicilian ragpicker is going to come up here and rob the rights of any Casamassima . " " There is nothing to do , " Bombolini told his general , " but to seize the offender 's water jug . " A seven-gallon water jug is a true weapon , especially when it is used unexpectedly . The head of the army went down in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sledge hammer . Pietrosanto might have pressed charges . They might have taken her down the mountain to Montefalcone on the charge of intent to kill , but Pietrosanto 's pride would not bear it and Bombolini was not yet ready for such a challenge to his young regime . The next morning the sign was down and the old ways were restored , and this was the death of pure democracy in Santa Vittoria . That night Bombolini had Fabio copy in his book : " There is nothing more difficult to carry out and more doubtful of success than to initiate a new order of things . For the reformer has enemies in all those who prosper by the old order . " He was training Fabio to become mayor of the city when he would no longer be available . This , then , was the way things were going in Santa Vittoria for Italo Bombolini . The people had trust in him , and then as the summer went on the harvest began to look rich and strong . The grapes were plentiful and they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the grapes are good , things in Santa Vittoria are good . If the failure of democracy at the fountain was his first error out of all the things that he did , I suppose it can be said that I was his second major error , since it was I who almost brought down his government . I came to Santa Vittoria the same morning that he was forced to take down his sign at the fountain .  | 1 HIS mum should be said at once . Although Fabio della Romagna , for a time at least , later came to hate me , if it had n't been for Fabio I would have died . The first people to find me in Santa Vittoria that morning assumed that I was dead . One of them felt my legs and when he felt their coldness , since the blood had run out of them hours before , he took my shoes . When they sent news of the body to Bombolini he agreed with the people that it should be taken at once , before the sun was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarry under the stones . Bornbolini 's fear was that the crime , if that was what it was , would be reported to Montefalcone and then the police would come , and the freedom of the city would be endangered . He woke Fabio , and Fabio came down the steps of the Mansion of the Leaders to  | see about taking me to the rock quarry , and he took one look at me in the grape basket and knew that I was alive . They are funny about the dead in Italy . They are fascinated with death , but not with the body that death leaves behind it . Sometimes the people are so anxious to get rid of the body that errors are made . Babbaluche , who made coffins when he was not cobbling , has stories about the men and women who came to life at the sound of earth raining down on the roof of what was to be their last home . The fingernails left behind in the soft wood of the boxes , Babbaluche says , are the monuments to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they took me upstairs into the Mansion of the Leaders and put me in a bed . I have no idea of how long I stayed there . Three or four times a day the girl , Angela , came and held my head in her lap and spooned broth and pasta and soft sopping bread into my mouth , and sometimes she poured me a small glass of wine . I had no idea that I ever would get well , nor any hope that I would . I leaned toward death . The bone in my leg had joined together , but it had come together all wrong . I would lie on the bed for hours at a time in darkness and never make a move . When it was light in the piazza , I never knew whether it was because the sun was going down or coming up . After some time , a week or two weeks , I began to realize that , with no effort on my part or any consciousness of it , I was beginning to understand all the shouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piazza . The language of my father and mother was returning to me . I had learned it as a small boy , but later , although it was spoken in the house , I had unlearned it . I would n't speak to my family in anything but English and I would n't listen to them unless they spoke to me in what we called American . I still dreamed at night about the boy , and the fat man or his daughter would have to come and restrain me while I would cry out and pound against the wall and hide beneath my blanket , which would go wet with sweat . But I knew that somewhere I had decided to try and live when one morning the girl was late coming with the broth and I was first hungry and then anxious and finally angry with her . And when she came , surrounded by all  | her smells , hot broth and good bread and strong soap and the freshness of herself , I found I was smiling . For some reason I was ashamed of myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world to smile . I wanted to say good morning to her and to talk with her , but I was afraid to begin . During all of this time I had allowed no one to know that I knew the language . I knew it was a dialect and that my parents must have come from some village in this region , but I did n't even know the name of it . That 's the kind of son I had been to them . It made me ashamed , not telling them about the language . I was deceiving people who had risked themselves to aid me . I had had no bad intentions at the beginning , it was only that I was too tired and too uninterested to want to speak , and also it was a simple form of selfdefense . The people would talk in front of me the way they talk in front of idiots and the deaf and small children . Only once did I come close to revealing myself . Bombolini and Fabio were in my room with some young men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vittoria came to look at me at one time or another . There is very little to do here , and I was an object of curiosity . They felt my clothes , and some of them even rubbed their hands along my back or arms . I used to wonder which one of them had my shoes . I never have found out . Whoever took them will keep them in the family until I am dead , for fifty years perhaps , and when I am gone they will come out into the open with them , probably at my own funeral . That is the way they are here . The young men were about to leave , I had bored them , when one of them looked down into the piazza from my window and said , " Oh my God , the Malatestas are back . " They all ran to the window and knelt down by it , since it is a low window and looked down into the piazza . The sound of their voices and the way they sucked in their breaths made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " one of them said , " the snotty one . What 's her name ? " None of them could remember at first . They all had a nickname for her , the Colt , Long Legs , the Icicle . Bombolini called her " the hawk "  | " Caterina , " one on them finally said . " Caterina , " everyone said . " Yes . Caterina . " She was crossing the Piazza of the People toward the street that leads down from High Town and because she was wearing city shoes on the cobblestones she did n't walk the way the other women here walk . The women here walk as if they were carrying a burden . It is not unpleasant to watch . They move slowly , with a kind of slow graceful power to the walk , and the motion of their bodies is as much side to side as it is forward . Both were graceful , the women of the city and this Caterina Malatesta , but their graces were of different kinds . This is not meant to demean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very beautiful , but the difference was that between a work horse and a race horse . Each has its use in the world , and its beauty , but one was meant to be used and worked and one was meant to be admired and to be ridden lightly . She carried two suitcases and although they appeared to be heavy no one made any effort to help her with them , and she did n't ask for any . The women waiting in line at the fountain all saw her , but they gave no sign that they had seen her . I know little about clothes , but her clothes were of the kind that even a very ignorant person recognizes as the kind that cost money and are what is called high style . " The Germans must be giving them hell in Rome , " Bombolini said . " They only come back when they 're in trouble . " " They must have put her husband in jail . What was his name ? " No one knew . " They must have killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were silent for a moment . " Look at the way she walks . Zip zap zip . Like she 's saying go screw yourself . " " She 's a beast . She cuts the balls off men . She 's no good for anything . If you married her you 'd have fun in bed and starve to death , " they said about her . There is a saying here : What you ca n't have , abuse . And this is what they were doing , but I did n't know it then . " But she 's very beautiful , " I said , in Italian , and not one of them  | noticed . She was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen . One morning I awoke and found that it was cool in the room , and when I leaned out of bed and looked across the piazza and over the houses to the mountains beyond I could see that they were covered with snow . Sometime in the night , unseen and unheard by us , a great storm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold of the north , had been waged up there , and now in the morning rivers of white flowed down the mountainside . When Angela came in with the broth I said , " If you go to my window you 'll see something beautiful . " She put down the broth and went to the window and crouched down by it and that moment she looked very beautiful to me . I had not noticed that she also was beautiful in the way of simple things . " I do n't see anything , " she said . " On the mountains . There 's snow this morning . " " Ah , the new wind . " She turned back to me . " The new wind has blown summer away . It 's good for the grapes . " She spoke to me in dialect and was not at all surprised that I could answer her back or understand her . " Cool nights now and warm days , " she said . " It brings out the sugar in the grapes . " " Are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We were wondering when you would begin to talk , " she said . " After all , you 've been here for weeks . " " But I talk rather well , do n't you think ? " She shrugged . " Little babies can speak at two years of age . You 're a man . " However , she went downstairs and told them that I was now talking and while there was no surprise about the miracle of my tongue there was interest and even excitement , because now they could do business with me . Bombolini , followed by some other members of the Grand Council , came running up the stairs to my room . " They say you talk very well , " he said to me . " Good . " He seized my hand and pumped it violently . He turned to the others . " What did I tell you ? What did I say about him ? " He shook my hand again so violently that it caused my leg to ache . " This is a very  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in the presence of a superior human being . " He squeezed my hand and he went downstairs without ever hearing me say a word in dialect or in Italian . Of all the people that I could hear downstairs only Fabio did not seem to be impressed by my language . " It 's a kind of trick really , " he told people . He told anyone who would listen about an idiot they hired at the Academy to clean chamber pots who had learned German in one month . " You see , " Fabio told them , " the ability to learn languages in this way is in some cases actually a sign of idiocy . " No one understood what Fabio was trying to tell them , and neither did I then . " Why do you keep telling us this ? " Bombolini asked him . " You sound as if you have something against the man . " " I have nothing against him , " Fabio said . " I only want to correct the record , to put things in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign of intelligence . " " But that 's just it , " Bombolini said . " I expected him to learn the language . You can see he 's brilliant . It sticks out all over him . " What despair I caused Fabio in those days , and I should have known it . Although the mayor had not stayed to listen to me speak on the first day , nothing could seem to stop him from coming back on the days that followed and I became sorry I had ever opened my mouth in the first place . He came in the afternoons when I was asleep and at night , and he stayed until I fell asleep in his face , asking me questions about how they did things in America , about the government and the setup of the states and the ruling of towns and the conduct of the police and the courts and the making of laws and the collecting of revenues  --  until I came to dread the sound of his step on the stairs . More than the intrusion and the effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know about that , " I would say . " I ca n't answer that . I never studied it , I never found out about it . " " It 's a wise man who can say I do n't know , " ' Bombolini would say . " Good man . "  | I would turn my head toward the wall in embarrassment . " It is only the wise ones who know the extent of their knowledge . " The few answers I was able to give him he speared the way a beggar spears chunks of meat in his soup . He fished them out before they could get away from him and then he rolled them around in his mouth , savoring them , before finally swallowing them . " Brilliant , " he would say . " These are brilliant things you tell me . It came so that I could n't bear the sight of Fabio 's face at such times . It was Fabio , however , who was finally able to figure out why Bombolini acted that way toward me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's amazing success at government that had changed him from a clown to a prince in one night . What Fabio found was that Bombolini was no longer Bombolini at all but someone else who had lived five hundred years before him . When faced with any problem or any decision , Bombolini would not become alarmed by it but would go back to The Prince and The Discourses and have Niccolo Machiavelli provide him with the proper answer . It was from these books and this man that he drew his wisdom and his assurance and his poise and his strength . Bombolini was only a face and a body and a mouth for The Master . All of the answers were n't in the books , of course , but the important thing was that Bombolini felt they were and , believing that , he had no fear and suffered no qualms . But somewhere along the line there were problems that even The Master could n't provide answers for , and it was for this reason , and for no love of me , that Bombolini turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affair of Babbaluche the cobbler and Abruzzi the American threatened to tear the Free City of Santa Vittoria apart and bring down its government . Life has changed little here since the days when Machiavelli went sourly through the streets of Florence , and yet some things have changed and it was these gaps in the Master 's knowledge that frightened Bombolini . To close them he needed a representative of the New Ways , someone forged in the fire of the New  | Culture , as Fabio says he put it . And who better than me , a dropper-in from the New World ? For the purposes of Italo Bornbolini , for his well-being and his assurance , it was essential that I prove to be brilliant and he made certain that I was . As soon as I was able to stand with the aid of a crutch the cobbler had made for me I was invited downstairs to sit in on sessions of the government and after a week I was invited to join the Grand Council as a full member , as a minister without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wonder what they would think in Benjamin Franklin High School , which I left when I was a junior , if they could see me sitting in the Grand Council as Minister Without Portfolio . This was the state of things when Babbaluche came up onto the terrace of the Mansion of the Leaders one night during a meeting of the Grand Council and came into the middle of the meeting and began pointing his finger at me . " Look at this son of a bitch , " he said . " Feast your eyes on him . " They looked at me and I think I blushed , because I had always felt like a fraud at the meetings in the first place . I felt naked before them . " Because of this son of a bitch each one of you stands to go to jail and to lose your vines . " It was the loss of the vines that struck fear in their hearts . " Do you know who this bastard is ? Do you know what he rep-resents ? " I felt they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked down , which did n't help my image before the people . " This son of a bitch is an enemy of the state . " " He seemed like a good man to me , " Giovanni Pietrosanto said . " That 's all that I know . " " An enemy of the state . " The argument was that , despite the fall of the Mussolini government and the emergence of the Badoglio government , America was still at war with Italy , and by making me a member of the Grand Council each member was guilty of treason and infamous acts by collaborating with the enemy . " You are collaborators , " Babbaluche told them . " Do you know what they do to collaborators ? "  | Everyone knew what they did . They took away your home and they impounded your land and they tore up your vines by the roots . " And even worse , you are guilty of consorting . " No one knew the penalty for consorting , but if that was worse than collaborating , no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bombolini to have deserted me then , and I have no doubt that he would have done so if his need for me had not been greater than the risk of being caught consorting . He could have put me in a cart and taken me to Montefalcone and turned me over to the authorities . It would have ended his troubles and even earned him some small favors , but he fought for me . They sent me from the room and I soon fell asleep , so I never heard the debate . The debate raged on during the night , and I understand that it was bitter , because no one has ever volunteered to tell me anything about it . Sometime early in the morning it finally became a question of confidence in the government and its leader . The issue was whether to turn me over and be safe or to keep me and run the risk of losing their vines and even their lives . Who could have trust in a government that had any doubt about which course to take ? At dawn Babbaluche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been writing . Resolved , That the people of the glorious Free City of Santa Vittoria , having lost all confidence in the ability of the leader Bombolini any longer to lead .. . They voted after this and no one has ever told me the count , so it must have been close . No one likes to tell me how close they came to putting me in the cart and taking me to Montefalcone . But whatever the count was , Italo Bombolini managed to do what Benito Mussolini failed to manage . I have heard that there was not much honor in the victory . All kinds of things were promised in return for all kinds of votes . I have heard , for example , that I was described as a rich young man who might come back someday and in thankfulness endow the city with such things as schools and fire departments . But perhaps that is n't true ; to this day I do n't know . None of it has ever both-  | ered Bombolini , because he had done the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : he had endured . Why did Babbaluche bring the charge , he who hated the Germans and the Fascists above all the rest of us ? It was , as Vittorini later told me , a curse of the nation and a curse of the blood . It is in Babbaluche 's nature to embarrass and destroy governments . The nation is filled with people like him . In this way they find their dignity . It is their only business and their only true passion . " They are the flies in the soup of state , " Vittorini told me . " They are not very large but they must be taken out or they will ruin the entire bowl of soup . " For show they put me under house arrest and they sent notice of my presence to Montefalcone by way of Fungo , an idiot here , who would make certain to lose the message and lie that be had delivered it to the carabinieri . They took away my membership in the Grand Council and I became an ex-minister without anything . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his low mark but he had survived , and in surviving he strengthened himself . That next day , in a show of strength , he had himself named Captain of the People instead of Mayor , an old and honored title in this region , and after a time even Babbaluche came to call him Captain .  | The Discourses of Italo Bombolini Anyone can be great with money . With money greatness is not a talent but an obligation . The trick is to be great without money . - ITALO BOMBOLINI Anyone can make an omelet with eggs . It takes a great man to make one with none . ? A saying of Santa Vittoria rip . - IIOSE MONTHS , the summer in Santa Vittoria , were good . There was hunger in Italy but there was no hunger here . There were shortages in everything but there was no true hunger . There was still good wine to trade and sell . Most of the wine here is vermouth , which is a blend of wines and aromatic herbs , and the vermouth we make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or lying to say it . This is a history and it is a simple and recognized fact that the wine made in Santa Vittoria is one of the best in the world . The vermouth is aged for a year or even two years , depending on the amount of sugar in the grapes and the amount of acid , on the time of month the grapes were picked , the position of the moon during the harvest and the whisperings of the gods of the  | grape into the ears of Old Vines , who alone here can hear them . Usually most of this wine is sold to the Cinzano family , who sell it all over the world , but because of the war the wine was still in Santa Vittoria . When we needed food three or four carts were loaded with wine from the Cooperative Wine Cellar and sent to Montefalcone , where there was always a market for our wine . The carts would come back up the mountain the next day filled with flour for bread and pasta , with bags of onions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with tins of sardines and mackerel from Sicily , with balls of cheese and wheels of cheese , whole carts filled with artichokes , sometimes boxes of cherries and baskets of fruit from the north , dry pork sausage , salami , black olives and green olives , cheap black wine in big wicker baskets , since our own wine is too good to drink every day  --  one basket of ours for three of theirs  --  baskets of beans and lentils , and tins and jugs of olive oil to splash on our bread . When the carts came back up the mountain you would not know there was a war on in Italy . But something was happening in Italy . The feeling could even be felt up on the mountain . There had been a time when two or three trucks in a morning was considered to be traffic on the Montefalcone road , but now the sound of trucks and half-tracks and even tanks could be heard from the River Road all day long and far into the night . " You should see what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the food would tell the others . " There are more tanks in there than there are people . There are more Germans than our own people . " We felt it , but it did n't concern us . There was food and the weather was good and the grapes were fattening on the vines like pregnant women . The people in Santa Vittoria looked up at the sky as a source of danger , for the signs of a sudden heavy rain or even a hail storm , more than they looked down at the road to Montefalcone . If the Italian nation was in danger of coming apart , the city of Santa Vittoria had never felt closer together . And for this , Italo Bombolini must take all of the credit . He had embarked the city on a program for greatness . Beside his bed in the Leaders ' Mansion he had hung this sign :  | Nothing causes a prince to be so much esteemed as great enterprises and giving proof of prowess . It keeps the people 's minds uncertain and astonished and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayor 's problem , as he put it , was how to conduct great enterprises in a city where people trail oxen with a broom and pan in hopes of getting a free surprise . How do you uncover greatness in a city so poor that a man will provoke another man into an argument just so that his donkey can be eating the other man 's grass while they argue ? How do you give proof of prowess in a place where a man was observed to stand all of one morning waiting for a pear on a private tree to be blown off by a wind and dropped into the street , thereby becoming public property ? How do you accomplish anything at all when the city treasury is so bare that the addition of one coin to the vault would double the contents ? Bombolini began by changing the names of all of the streets . There were public hearings , there were contests among the children and the young and the old of the town , there were votes and re-votes , speeches and arguments , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement . In the end the Piazza Mussolini became the Piazza Matteotti , named for the first famous victim of the Fascist regime . It was a very popular decision . We were surprised to find after the war that five hundred other Italian towns had done the same thing . The Corso Mussolini became the Corso Cavour , because it sounded good and every town must have something named after Cavour . Then came the whole rest of the Risorgimento . There is never any problem naming anything as long as the names of the Risorgimento are recalled . Streets were named for Mazzini , for Garibaldi , for the Redshirts . One street was even named for Vittorio Emmanuele , and when no one was sure exactly which number was the good Vittorio the number was left off and now stands for any Vittorio Emmanuele you may desire .  | The Street of D'Annunzio the Poet posed a problem , since no one , not even Fabio , knew of another poet to match D'Annunzio . " What is the greatest book in Italy ? " Bombolini asked Fabio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you sure of that ? I have never heard of it . " " There is no question about it . " " Who wrote it then ? " Bombolini said , and Fabio turned scarlet . The name escaped him and to save him further embarrassment the street was named Street of the Author of I Promessi Sposi , although the people still called it Goat Alley , as they always had done . The effort was a great success . It had cost nothing , but had brought the people closer together . Perhaps the only saddened person was Bombolini himself . When the last of the streets and piazzas and lanes was named and there were no more left , Fabio found Bombolini sitting in the darkness of the large room in the Leaders ' Mansion , which that morning had been renamed the Palace of the People . " The people have entertained the vice of ingratitude , " he told Fabio . I was coming down the stairs on my crutches . " Never trust the people about anything , " he shouted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgetfulness . " It was embarrassing to both of us , and we attempted to look away from the Captain without seeming to look away . " Look at them out there , walking about , enjoying themselves . Do you know why ? Because I carry their burdens for them , that 's why . Ingratitude . " He slammed the door shut and the room was dark again . " Do you know what ingratitude is ? Ingratitude is the crack in the sewer that turns the sweet waters of life into a running shit pot . The sons of bitches . " They could hear him pull back a chair and sit at the table . " They did n't even name an arch after me . " We were glad we could n't see him , because both of us felt he was beginning to cry . In the morning it was as if nothing had taken place . He was as bright as the sun . It is said somewhere that the art of art is to make the work seem artless and this is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Fabio and occa-  | sionally myself , no one had any idea at all of the work and thought that went into the things that he did and how much of himself was in them . " Fabio , " he said . " Go and get your notebook . You are going to see a man make an omelet without any eggs and I want you to see how it is done . " * * * It was Fabio who saved my life , and it was Fabio who was responsible for getting Caterina Malatesta to repair the bone in my leg . I did n't understand it at the time , but he wanted my leg made well so that I could go away from Santa Vittoria . " You 're a soldier and a soldier must make every effort to rejoin his own men so that he can continue the fight , " Fabio told me . I nodded . Fabio was not the person he had been before . Even I , a stranger , could notice it . He was moody and then sullen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he had begun to drink too much wine . In truth , Fabio was drunk a good deal of the time . Everyone said it was the books . They begged him to give up the books because clearly his mind had been pushed to the breaking point . We did n't know it then , or for a long time afterward , that it was the sight of Angela Bombolini feeding me broth and the sound of Angela Bombolini talking to me while I stretched out on my bed in the People 's Palace that was destroying Fabio before us . Bombolini himself had gone up to High Town to see the Malatesta , as they called her , and she had laughed in his face . Even after that , as shy as he was , Fabio went to see her , and for reasons we do n't know the Malatesta agreed to come and see me . It is a measure of how desperate Fabio must have been . She was not a doctor in the sense that she had a license to practice in Italy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final year , when her father , to save the family , forced her to leave school and marry a very rich young Roman , of a noble and influential family , who was a rising Fascist and a friend of Count Galeazzo Ciano.  | Her family had once been a great family in this region . Once they held large holdings of land , but they began to lose it , plot after plot , in all the ways a family destined for disaster can find to lose its land . They had no love for the land , and worse , no greed for it , and no one can hold onto land around here without it . There are too many who want it too much . At the time of the marriage they were reduced to a few parcels of land and several houses in the region , one of which was in High Town and which various Malatestas retreated to from time to time to lick their wounds . When they would leave they would leave the house an unspeakable mess . The Malatestas did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one knew how the marriage came out . There is a picture of the rich husband in the Malatesta house , but it is assumed by all that he died when Mussolini was ousted . The face in the frame is one of those faces that it takes one thousand years of privilege and money to breed . When she came into my room she never really saw me . She took off the smelly bandages that Dr. Bara had put on the wound , and took them off with no gentleness , and threw them on the floor . I was ashamed of my wound because it stank and I began to apologize for it to her . That is the effect she has on people . She did n't hear me . " This wound will have to be opened , " she told me . " The infection will have to be cleared up and the bone will have to be rebroken and set again . " " If you say that it has to be done . " " It does n't have to be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done . " " I want a leg . " " It will hurt a great deal . " " It hurts a good deal now . " " It will hurt a great deal . " I shrugged and she smiled at me , which confused me . " You do n't know the pain I am talking about . I ca n't take you to the hospital , you understand . " " I understand that . "  | " Americans are n't prepared for pain . They think they have a right to avoid pain , " she said . " The people here know different . They know that pain is the natural condition of life . " I did n't understand why she was telling me these things . Angela had come into the room and although the Malatesta was conscious that she was there she gave no sign of it until , without looking at her either , she ordered Angela to pick up my filthy bandages . " " Yes , signorina . " " Signora . " " Yes , signora , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small curtsy . " I will come for you when I am ready , " the Malatesta told me . " Ca n't you give me some idea , to prepare myself ? " " When I 'm ready I 'll come , " she said . " What are you going to do when they come ? " " When who come ? " " The Germans . " " I do n't know yet , " I told her . " People say they wo n't come here . I speak the language . Maybe they wo n't know . " She laughed at me . At the door she turned to Angela , although she still did n't seem to see her . " You come to my house after you clean up here . I have some work for you , " the Malatesta told her . " Yes , signora . " She made a curtsy again . When the Malatesta was gone I was embarrassed for Angela . " You would n't go up there , " I said . " Not after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn to be surprised . " Of course I 'll go . We like to go . We charge her three times too much . " " But the way she talked to you . " I could see that Angela did n't understand what I was talking about . I could see what I should have been able to understand myself  --  how much a luxury pride and honor can be . It helps to be well-fed enough to nourish them both . And I should have been able to understand what they say about the peasant , that he needs  | two things here  --  a sharp mind and thick soles . The truth is that no peasant has ever died of a broken heart . " Oh , yes , " Angela said , picking up my bandages . The sight and smell of my own bandages made me turn away . " We milk her well . " The Malatesta was a hawk but if there was a pigeon in the room , I began to understand who it was . The Malatesta came back several days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local anesthetic and a bottle of grappa with Fabio as a helper , and a half hour after she arrived she cracked the bone in my leg . There was , as she had promised there would be , a moment of " superior " pain ( it pleases me to this day to think that she was impressed when I did n't cry out ) , and she began to reset the bone . During all of that time she never said one word to me to make me feel like a man or even as if she were working on a human being . At the end of it she said , " You lie in bed for one week and then you get up and try and walk . The sooner you walk on this the better it will be for you . " She went to the door of the room and turned and looked out the low window into the piazza . " But I doubt that you will do it , " she said . It was this , of course , that sent me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face stiff with pain and running with a cold sweat , exactly one week after the Malatesta had come into the room with her grappa and her rubber hammer . The more I walked the stronger the leg would become . It had withered until it looked like the leg of an old man , and I began to go down through the streets and finally all the way to the wall and the Fat Gate and down onto the terraces . The people liked me down there . I gave them an excuse to stop their work and talk . I had the strongest feeling that I had been in all of these places before , in the town and on the terraces . I seemed to know everything in advance , and there were no surprises for me . I think now it must have been caused by all the images left in my mind , even when I was n't listening to them , by the talk of all the people from " the other side , " from " the old country , " who sat around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine and anisette and telling about the old days and how their children were falling to pieces in America .  | In the end I would make it a point to go all the way down the mountain to the foot of the terraces and then to rest in the enormous ancient wine cellar at the base of the mountain before forcing myself to climb up again . This was one thing that was different . I had never seen anything like the cellar before , and I came to love it for its coolness and quiet . It had been built by the Romans and then sometime in the Middle Ages it had been rebuilt entirely and so it was n't the goal for tourists that it might otherwise have been . It had finally been abandoned in the eighteenth century . There were two cellars actually , and one day this was to mean a great deal to Santa Vittoria . There was a small opening in the mountainside which led into an enormous room , hollowed out of the mountain itself , which was called the Great Room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cathedral , and I have no idea why they ever built such a room , unless in Roman times it had been used as a temple to some god of wine . From the back wall of the Great Room two long , deep wine cellars were cut into the bowels of the mountain . I did n't go into the cellars themselves , because they were humid and I could sense that they were filled with water , but the Great Room was cool by the entrance and I would lie on the dry sand and take a nap before going back up . I soon found that I was the only person in Santa Vittoria who ever went into the old wine cellar . They were afraid of the spirits who lived in there . Everyone in Santa Vittoria has some story about some member of his family who strayed into the tunnel in a sudden storm and the terrible things that happened to them in there . They feared for my life , but when nothing happened to me it did n't lessen their belief in the evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not interested in nonItalian people . During the week that I had spent in bed before walking I had worked on the radio of Vittorini , the mail clerk . They had brought it to me to fix because I was an American and Americans are supposed to be able to fix new inventions such as radios . I knew nothing about radios , but there is a certain logic about anything that is broken . Sooner or later there has to be something that is n't connected , and if it can be connected , as with my leg , then perhaps it  | may be made to work again . I finally got it to work . In those days we received an hour of electricity a day from the power station at San Rocco del Lago . Some days it never came at all . But on one day when it did come I heard a broadcast from Egypt that was sent to Italy by the English . The Americans , they said , were almost all the way across Sicily and the invasion of the mainland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited about that , and I shouted out the news before I realized that the last thing I wished then was to be liberated . But it did n't matter in any case . Fabio had no interest , and Bombolini , even though he was from Sicily , listened to me without really understanding the words . He was far too interested in cooking his eggless omelet.  | THE OMELET Bombolini was preparing was intended to feed the entire city , and he succeeded in doing it . He gave the people great enterprises and proofs of prowess , and he kept the people 's minds astonished and occupied in watching their result at a cost of nothing . The patron saint of this place is not Santa Vittoria , as you would have a right to expect . No one even knows who Santa Vittoria is , although it is thought that she is a corruption of some earlier pagan god who had to do with the wine . But the patron saint here , as our luck would have it , does not deal with the grape and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make Him look after the vines or the rains or the condition of the soil . The patron saint here is Santa Maria of the Burning Oven , a local  | peasant girl who did the kinds of things that saints do to get themselves canonized and who was then thrust upon this city . For example , once a baker here , while pulling out his loaves , fell headlong into his ovens . His screams could be heard all over the city , but there was nothing anyone could do for him except to hope that he did n't ruin the day 's bread . But then the little girl Maria walked right into the blazing oven and picked up the baker and carried him into the street . Neither suffered a burn , and the bread that night was said to be the best ever baked in the city . Another time , some pilgrims were passing through the city on their way to Siena . They had been caught in a snowstorm and were starving . There was nothing in the city to feed them  --  not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilgrims ? except a crust of bread , and they were sure they were going to die . " You mock us . What good is this crust of bread ? " the leader said to Maria . " Eat of it , " the girl told them . They ate , and as the leader cut into the little crust at each cut a fresh slice of bread leaped onto the blade of the knife . They ate until they were fat with bread . It was said by all to be the best they had ever tasted . One night the same baker , who must have been excessively clumsy , lost his wooden bread shovel in the oven . When Maria rescued the shovel from the oven it was only a charred crisp . " How can I work without a bread shovel ? " the baker asked . " Weep not and God will find a way , " the girl said . In the morning the shovel had been restored . New wood had grown where the old wood had been burned , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many here believe the shovel was certainly a part of the wood from the True Cross . Bombolini 's plan , as simple as possible , was to turn Santa Vittoria into a national and then an international shrine for all the bakers of the world . Bakers from all over the world , who lacked a saint of their own , would want to come and pay homage to the Little Saint of the Bread Oven , as Bombolini began to call her . What novice baker would wish to begin a career without first  | coming to Santa Vittoria and spending a few days , a novena perhaps , nine blessed days on the mountain , praying to God through Santa Maria to favor him so that he might make money in his new career ? Old bakers would want to come and give thanks for their success . Bakers who were in trouble and going broke would want to come and get God and Santa Maria on their side for a change . The idea of Santa Vittoria as a national shrine became a craze here . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was proclaimed , a road would have to be built up the mountain to accommodate the pilgrims ; and if there was a road , there would he taxis and maybe even a bus . The pilgrims would need places to stay and places to eat . Every home was a potential inn , every woman a potential cook , every vine pruner a potential waiter going around in white jackets and soft shoes collecting tips for doing next to nothing . A cooperative bakery turning out bread from the Shrine of Blessed Bread ( each loaf personally blessed by Polenta for a fee ) could be started , and then there would be a need for curio shops selling such things as little wooden bread shovels and clay ovens and satin pillows with pictures of Santa Maria on them and wooden plaques that read Santa Maria of the Burning Oven , bless this humble bakery . It was felt by some that within ten years ' time only a fool would ever have to go down to work on the terraces again . Most leaders would have stopped there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a dark side to man that needs a way out as well as the good side . The Master had written . " Hatred is gained as much by good works as by evil . " As they say , if there is no acid in the grape the wine is tasteless and finally useless . " The wise prince , " Bombolini told Fabio , with his finger in the air , " must foment some enmity so that by suppressing it he will augment his greatness . " It was this that led him to declare war on Scarafaggio and which also led to Fabio 's leaving Santa Vittoria . Scarafaggio ! You have only to say the word and you can picture the town . There is no beauty to it . It sits across the valley on the other mountain , a feeble imitation of Santa Vittoria . It huddles over there like a sheep dog whose master beats her ; it cowers there , filled with fleas and ticks and roaches . We have bedbugs  | here , but they only survive here ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the greatest fools in Italy , which is no easy title to claim . One example must suffice . Fifty years ago they found that their church was too small and since , of course , no one in the town was capable of enlarging it they were forced to go outside and ask bids for the work . No one would go there , of course , but finally they found a man who said he would stretch their church for them , and since his fee was so small they were willing to believe him . He told everyone to go to bed , that his magic must be done in silence and in secrecy . And then he went in the church and locked the door and sometime in the night he took out the last pew of the church by the back wall and threw it over the wall , down into the bushes . After this he took strong raw soap and he soaped all of the floor along by the back wall where the pew had once stood . In the morning twenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic must be done in secret , and they were led into the church and placed against the wall , facing it , with their hands on the stones . " Now push , " the stranger ordered . " Push . Push . Push . " And it was incredible . They pushed and they felt the wall move away from them . They pushed and pushed until the last of them was face down on the ground . " Now take off your blindfolds . " When they did they could see that it was true . A miracle had been passed . They got up and ran down into the piazza outside the church . A miracle , they cried . The church had been stretched . The back wall was now a full five feet away from the back pew and there was room for another row of pews and more . The people were pleased with their new church . " You could hardly tell it was stretched , " they said . They were so pleased with the results that they paid the church stretcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , which was considerably more than they had planned to pay , and to this day it remains a mystery in Scarafaggio as to how the newer , bigger church with the added pew holds exactly the same number of souls as the old one . In the first week in September that year Bombolini called a  |p1116  meeting of all the people in the Piazza of the People on a Sunday , and he asked the people to look out over the valley at Scarafaggio . " They 're laughing at us over there , " he told the people . This was astonishing news . " For two hundred years they have been going around , every day , laughing at us . " It was hard to believe . He allowed them a few minutes to study the miserableness heaped up across the valley , and then the bell in our tower rang out . " Do you hear that ? " Captain Bombolini asked them . Everyone nodded , and then he pointed across the valley . " Well so do they . " He allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by our bell . They go out by our bell . They go to Mass by our bell . " The people were astounded by this . It had never occurred to any of them before . " We pay for the bell and they use the sound . While someone here sweats to make it ring they lie in their beds and listen to it sing . They lie in their beds and they laugh . " If the best thing in the world is to get something for nothing it follows that the worst is to give away something and get nothing back for it . " It is as simple as this , " Bombolini told them . " Scarafaggio is stealing our sound . " The people were violent about it . Pietrosanto , for example , was all for calling out the Santa Vittoria army and marching on Scarafaggio . It became a little foolish after that , and everyone today is willing to admit it . But at the moment there seemed nothing foolish about it . " Take down the bell , " someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Better no bell than to give away our sound . " There was a roar of approval . " Keep the bell , but cut the rope so no one can ring it , " another man shouted . That made even more sense . To his credit , Bombolini was able to restrain the excited people . He pointed to the new sign at the end of the piazza . " Remember . The three true virtues of the Italian people . Tranquillity . Calmness . Patience . Restrain yourselves . Your captain has a plan for you . The old wrong will be righted . " So the city was excited after that . The people , as the Master  | said they should be , were astounded . That Sunday night three men left Santa Vittoria with a mule and a donkey and some of the old Etruscan vases from the room in the Palace of the People that had once served as a museum , and everyone knew it had to do with the Solution . Only Fabio , to whom Bombolini had already told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through with this I leave Santa Vittoria , " Fabio said . " I resign from the Grand Council . I return to Montefalcone where I belong . " Bombolini was hurt by this , because Fabio , in a way , is the conscience of Santa Vittoria . " It 's an evil thing , " Fabio said . " You know it is . It appeals to the people 's worst instincts . " " That 's not such a bad instinct , Fabio , to want what is yours . " " It 's a rotten instinct and you know it . " " You forget one thing , Fabio . The people are the people , yes , but they also are only human beings . They are only Christians , not Christs . " Fabio put on his hat to show that he was leaving . " You have no right to sell the Etruscan vases . They belong to the people . To all of us . " " No one ever looked at them , you know that . They sat in there covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " " The vases , " Fabio said , with elaborate disgust , " happen to be two thousand years old . " " And what good is a vase if it ca n't carry water ? " The look of pain on Fabio 's face was genuine . " You hurt me deeply , " Bombolini said . " You make me feel like some kind of evil person . " " If they come back up this mountain with that thing , I go , " Fabio said , and he left . It was not known at the time , no one could understand Fabio 's ways then , but he wanted an excuse to leave the city other than for his own self , his own broken heart , and he had found it . If anyone should have been able to see it , it was myself ; but I was young then and did n't wish to see things like that . The men who had left Santa Vittoria with the donkey and the mule came back to the city early one evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Etruscan vases were gone , but on the back of the mule was a large package wrapped in old sheets and tied around with grapevine . The people went down into the streets to see them come . They tried to touch the package , but the men pushed them away . Fabio came to see me in my room . " All right , " he told me . " I 'm leaving . You can have her now . She is all yours . " I told him I did n't know what he was talking about . In a way I did n't , and yet in a way I knew what he meant . " You know what I mean , " he said . I had never seen him angry in this way before . He was cold and he seemed at once years older than before and years older than myself because he had suffered . If I had fought with Fabio then , it would have been the sort of fight that could not have stopped until one of us was dead or close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e es , " he said . " She devours you . She falls all over you . " " I never asked her to . " " Oh , no . You lie there and lead her on , because you Americans do n't have manners as we do . You take advantage " He was suddenly very generous toward me . " It 's all right . I would do the same thing . Do I hate you for it ? I envy you . It 's nothing . I was simply born in the wrong place . " I was thankful that it was dark in my room and he could n't see my face then . I had meant nothing by the little games I played with Angela , although something seemed to take place between us when we played them . " Why do you think an American would n't marry you ? " I would say to Angela . " Oh , Americans do n't go for girls like me . They want rich girls . " " It helps . But they like pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty enough . " " Maybe not , " I would say . " Then again . Stand up there by the window and let me see you . " She was so simple and so sweet and of course she would stand by the window . " Americans want women like the Malatesta . " " Oh , all men want women like the Malatesta . But if you ca n't  | get the MaIatesta you have to get someone else . Someone like ... someone like ... " And she would turn scarlet . I did n't know then that men and women did n't talk to each other this way in Santa Vittoria unless they were going to be married , or that they did n't talk to each other in the same room or that many of them never touched one another until the date of their wedding was announced . " She never sees me , " Fabio said . " She has forgotten my name . I 'll tell you what she has done . " He was close to shouting at me by then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me my plate of beans . " He went to his own room to pack his things . * * * The men with the package unwrapped it that night and did what work they had to do so that it was ready for Sunday morning . On that morning Fabio della Romagna left the city for Montefalcone . He did not take his bicycle , because it was dangerous to be on the roads with a bike without a pass from the Germans or without a good reason . The few things he took were in a small , crude knapsack on his back . He reached the bottom of the mountain and was crossing the flat fields toward the River Road that leads to Montefalcone , when some men he knew from Santa Vittoria came running toward him . " Fabio , " one of them shouted at him . " Fabio , Fabio , Fabio . It 's marvelous . Look . " He turned Fabio around so that he was looking back up the mountain at the city . Someone on the Fat Wall was waving what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You understand , Fabio ? " the man said to him . " That means it 's ringing and we ca n't hear a thing . " " Nothing ! " " Not a Goddamn thing , " a third man said . " You should have seen them in Scarafaggio , Fabio . Their jaws hanging open . What happened to the bell ? ' they ask . What 's the matter with the bell ? ' " " And not a sound , Fabio , " the first one said again . " The greatest moment in the history of the city of Santa Vittoria . " None of them understood when Fabio broke loose and began to  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | was billeted more swiftly than he usually did and it caused him pain , since he was still recovering from wounds he had received the year before . All the men stationed with his unit in Montefalcone had been damaged in some serious fashion in North Africa or in Russia . Despite the pain , he continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piazza . There had been a rumor that the Americans and the English had made a landing somewhere south of Rome that morning and that the Italians not only had withdrawn from the war but were about to declare themselves in a state of war with Germany . At eight o'clock the news would come from the English in Cairo , and he wanted to be with the other officers when Colonel Scheer turned it on . It is a fortunate thing for us that the letters of Captain von Prum have been preserved in the archives of Santa Vittoria , which actually is nothing more than the battered old gray file cabinet that von Prum was forced to leave behind when he left Santa Vittoria . It is a fortunate thing that he made and preserved copies of everything he wrote , military records , entries in his diary and log , letters to his brother who was serving on the eastern front in Russia , and even letters to his fiancee , Christina Mollendorf , which were filed under the heading " Love Interest . " From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain that might always have puzzled us here if we had not been able to have them translated and read to us . It does n't seem out of place to print parts of several of the letters the captain wrote that day . From the notes to his brother Klaus , we have been able to figure out that during an action along the Dnieper Bend several of Klaus 's soldiers broke and ran in the face of Russian tanks , although they later returned to the field of battle . Despite this , the young men were shot , as an example to the others ; and the officer who had reported them , Klaus von Prum , was badly shaken by the action . Dear Father : Mother writes to ask if I am happy . It can only be German mothers who write to ask if their sons are happy at war . Actually I am happy . Happy to be alive , happy to still have my  | leg . I wo n't be climbing any mountains , but each day the leg grows stronger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am worried about him . As you can see I am now in the Financial Affairs Section , the Jewish Infantry as you used to call it . I am afraid that any chance of earning a medal now rests with Klaus . Actually we have little to do with finances . We spend most of our time cataloguing the assets of the area , and I will let you to guess what for . You ask how it is here in Montefalcone and I answer you . Pleasant but dirty . If these people could be persuaded to keep their streets clean and their plaster from falling down , it might be called attractive and even beautiful . They seem to have an affinity for falling plaster . My side job is that of Cultural Relations officer and it has been no easy task . It is no simple assignment to persuade these people that we come as friends and not as conquerors . The money here comes from wine and I can tell you this much . Under sound German management the gross product of the region could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways . They have a positive affinity for duplication and waste . If nothing else , the work improves my Italian . I even speak the dialect now , to the amazement of one and all . When next you see me I will be spikking like a proper wop . Respectfully , your son , Sepp von Prum Captain , Infantry I suppose by now you have heard of the rescue of Mussolini by the SS pilot or some such story . The fact that he was n't put to death is so typical of the sentimental and disorganized Eytie . How such a clown ever got in control of the government in the first place is beyond a puzzle , but then history shows that these people have an affinity for clowns . Darling Christina , ma petite chou : You ask about the Italian women . Do you recall last week when I described the inability of these people to plan for the future because they only live for the present ? Well . About their women . This is one case where they are right . STOP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with anger . Let me put it in this fashion . Some of these women are beautiful . And some of them most decidedly seem to have an affinity for blond ,  | light-skinned , blue-eyed men . But then one loses interest in them because there is always this feeling ( I am sorry to be crude ) that their underwear , if indeed they have any on at all , is not clean . And so one loses interest . Frankly I think their interest in us is just because we might have on clean underwear ourselves . Do this for me . Put down this letter at once and go to your mirror and then look into it and know this , that little face in that glass , those clear blue eyes and those full lips and that soft white complexion belong to the kind of woman that appeals to me . You may cease blushing now . Lovingly , Sepp von Prum Klaus : What kind of nonsense is this you have written home ? You have upset your family . Let us try to isolate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you are an officer in the Army of the Third Reich . You ask what you should have done and I tell you . You do what you did . You do your duty . If your commanding officer says they should be shot for the best of all , they are shot . It is as simple as that . You have lost your concept of duty . Duty is what ? Duty is one 's responsibility to an idea larger than the self . This cancer of the self ! The putting of one 's conscience beyond one 's duty is the true sickness of our time . Look at this place . To coddle the self the people have lost the ability to perform the simplest collective actions . They can not even keep their streets swept , Klaus . You say you feel " chained " by the Germanic sense of duty . You have an affinity for the overcomplex argument . Duty does not bind one , it frees one from personal responsibility . Duty liberates action . All kinds of acts become possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fatherland or not ? There is nothing complex about it . Duty sticks out . Once you have done your duty you will eat better and sleep better and feel better , because self-doubt will have been put to death . You have always had an affinity for the morbid , and the time has come for it to cease . Get on with your soldiering and do your duty and take care of yourself . Your brother , Sepp  | A memorandum to a superior officer in the Cultural Affairs Section in Munich : Your idea for the posters was a limited success . The people desecrated them . What they did was childish , of course , but it was also clever , in the manner of bright children everywhere . You will recall the first poster , the one of the tall blond smiling German soldier holding out his hand and saying " Remember , the German soldier is your friend . " Someone here has gone about painting the hand red and dripping with blood . All of them had to be taken down . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of a road to go to the aid of an Italian street urchin who has been hurt , although clearly his uniform will be ruined by the Samaritan act . There are no words on this one , as you recall , because the picture tells the story . Someone has gone about writing on them : " Yes , but why did you hit him in the first place ? " We took those down also . I think our basic error is that we have been attempting to treat these people as mature responsible beings , when our approach should have been to treat them as they actually are , that is , overage children . The last paper is a memorandum to himself , under the title " Some Thoughts on the Italian Character . " In General : Italians act from emotion , not reason , in the manner of children . Conclusion : Treat them as such . Specific : Germans have a sense of cultural inferiority toward Latins . They appear quick and clever , whereas we seem dull and stolid . Answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any values or beliefs . Since the Nordic functions from a firm set of values he is limited in the breadth of his movement , but not in depth . Example : The German has an affinity for truth ; the nation is a reservoir of truth . When a German says he will be some place at six he will be there . No Italian will ever be at the appointed place on time , because he does not intend to be there . He will come late , but he  | will have a remarkable lie to tell as to why he failed to arrive on time . All Italians have an affinity for the lie . Over-all conclusion : It is a mistake , then , to treat children as one would treat adults . Persuasion and logic are a waste of time . During the occupation the leader must conduct himself as a father  --  stern but understanding . As the father , one can take advantage of the German virtues , of organization , of planning , of moral and physical strength . As such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except as a potential threat , such as the whip in the woodshed . We should rule by respect , as any father is respected by a child . Such a policy should release thousands and thousands of men for active duty now tied down in occupation police duties . Police are not needed for errant children , fathers are needed . Discuss these thoughts with Colonel Scheer . The captain was disappointed when Colonel Scheer stamped his letter to Klaus as " Approved , " without so much as glancing at it . It was the kind of letter a junior officer might wish his senior officer to see . " And now , shall we tune in Radio Cairo ? Just to see what lies they are telling , of course , " the colonel said . It was a standing joke , since it was accepted by all of them that the English provided the most reliable source of news . When the radio began to operate , officers from other rooms began to gather in the doorway . The rumors had been correct . Landings had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Salerno , south of Rome and Naples . The Italians had declared themselves out of the war and would soon , in a matter of hours , come in again on the side of the Allies . " Oh , God , what good news , " the colonel said . " No longer do we have to lose men saving the wops . " When the broadcast was finished the colonel turned off the radio and faced the officers in the room and at the doorway . " There have been no official orders as yet , but you know what this means . As of this moment , Plan A is in effect . Unless I am seriously wrong , Operation Clutch will commence in a day or two . " Plan A was a full combat alert , in which the Italians would be  | treated like the people in any occupied territory , as the enemy and a source of potential danger . Operation Clutch was the formal plan designed to occupy Montefaleone and the rest of the outlying area . Captain von Prum left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were billeted . He went up one flight of stairs and looked into a large cluttered room . " We do n't need formality , " he said . But the soldiers were startled by the presence of an officer in their quarters and they got to their feet in confusion . " Come to attention , " Sergeant Traub shouted at them , and all of them , even the naked soldier , came to attention and remained that way until von Prum released them . Along one wall of the room were buckets of glue and brushes and rolls of posters , this one showing a German soldier helping an old Italian woman across a busy street . The captain pointed to them . " You wo n't need those any longer , " he said . " We are at war with Italy . " Some of the soldiers smiled , and some waited to see what the proper action was supposed to be . The captain took this chance to examine his detachment . It was the first time he had seen them all together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only eight of them , and all had been seriously wounded and were now on limited duty . The senior of them , Sergeant Gottfried Traub , had been hit in the face by shell fragments , and the muscles had been severed , so that the captain found it impossible to know what the sergeant was thinking from his expression . He had reached one conclusion , which was that the sergeant appeared happier when he was n't smiling at which time his face became distorted . " We 're all going to become soldiers again . No more glue pots , " the captain said . Once again the men did n't know how to take the news . He took out the map of this section of Italy . It was so typical and correct , von Prum thought , that the only reliable map of the whole area had been sent to him by his father from Mannheim . " You will note , " he said , " a good German map and so we are safe . At least we will be sure to wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | His slender finger touched the city of Montefalcone . " We are here . " The soldiers , who were timid about doing it at first , began to gather around the map . " We eventually will be here . " He began to move his finger down the line from Montefalcone and out to the Mad River and along the red line on the map which marked the River Road . It was dark by then , and the noise of tanks and half-tracks from the streets and piazzas outside was so loud that he had to shout to make himself heard . They were wasting no time . " It 's on the mountain , as you can see . " The soldier who had been naked , Corporal Heinsick , had put on clothes and was leaning over the map . His thick , stubby finger touched the city and then crossed the map to the road . " There 's no line to it . There 's no road . " " There 's a road . It is a track , really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal to it . Are there other questions ? " The soldiers were silent because they were not accustomed to asking their officers questions . It bothered some of them and made them nervous . But one thing had been troubling them from the beginning and they looked at Sergeant Traub , and so he finally said it . " Sir ? There seem to be only eight of us , not counting yourself . " " That is correct . " Again there was an embarrassed silence and the man kept looking at Traub . " Captain Pfalz has fifty in his command . They feel they need fifty to take and hold their town , sir . " " We need only eight . " They knew that it was the end to the questions , and they made a show of gathering around the map again to exhibit interest . Traub touched the name on the map . " Sanda Viddoria , " he said . " Yes . Santa Vittoria , " the captain said . " Ah , yes . Sanda Viddoria , " the sergeant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown dark . Walking the River Road in the dark is hard , but the darkness had brought the traffic out , hundreds of cars and trucks and half-tracks moving by the little light of hooded parking lights , all heading south and he could see by them . He was forced to the side of the road , but he could see . A few soldiers riding the trucks shouted at him and made gestures at him and one or two actually aimed their rifles at him , but Fabio failed to respond . He was no fun for them . At the gate into the city , still guarded by an Italian and a German , Fabio felt they would arrest him , but he did n't really care about that .  | " You 're not going to learn much at the academy , " the Italian guard told him . " It 's closed . " " He only shrugged and they passed him through . " Make Goddamn sure you check in with the prefect of police in the morning , " the guard told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every foot of the city seemed to be filled with trucks and armored vehicles , pressed up alongside the walls of the houses for protection , some of them with men in them , sleeping under camouflage nets . A few of them said things to Fabio in German , but he did n't really hear them . He went to the pensione where he had shared a room with two other students , and he found that Germans were in it . " What the hell do you think you 're doing here ? " the woman who ran the house shouted at him . " Do n't you know about the curfew ? Do n't you know what 's going on . You better get off the streets and out of here and stay out . " " What happened to my books ? " " They burned them . They used them to heat food . Page by page . " " Could n't you stop them ? " She laughed at him . " Then they would have used my furniture . I told them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He did n't know where he was going . He decided to try to reach the house of Galbiati , an instructor he had been fond of and who had been fond of him . He went down the Corso directly into the Piazza Frossimbone . Soldiers sitting in the darkness of doorways said things to him , but he walked on at his own pace . It is hard to frighten anyone who has no more use for life . At one side of the piazza a large sign had been put up and it was lit by a light that was shielded from the sky . A group of German officers and noncorns were gathered about the sign discussing what it said and taking notes and Fabio walked across to it . The sign was a large , carefully drawn map of the Montefalcone region and on it , broken down into ten areas and twenty subareas , were the names of all the towns and villages that would be occupied within the next several days . The information included the names of the occupying units , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they would arrive . Fabio , even in the con-  | dition he was in , could appreciate the thoroughness of the work . San Pietro would be occupied tomorrow morning . Garafano Maggiori tomorrow afternoon , San Rocco del Lago the next evening . Santa Vittoria and Scarafaggio were listed as being in Area R , Subareas 5 and 6 . The Germans would come on Wednesday , at 1700 hours . Three days . Not quite three days . At five o'clock in the afternoon . The bad time . How often things seemed to happen at the bad time , the seventeenth hour , Fabio thought . " It 's enough time for them , " Fabio told himself . He was n't sure if he said the words aloud . " They can ring their cork bell when they come . " He went through the little dark park in the center of the piazza and as he did he heard a girl struggling with a man . " Do n't do that to me , " she said . " You promised . You gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitch , " the man said  --  in good Italian , although he was German  --  and Fabio heard him hit her and then he heard her fall back through the underbrush and strike the ground and by the sounds he knew the German had run . " You had better stop that crying , " Fabio told her . He did n't know where she was , but the crying stopped and when he went to find her she had already gone . Girls who went with German soldiers deserved what they got , he thought , although as he said it he knew the soldiers sometimes went to the girls ' houses and made it impossible for the families to refuse . All they could do was hope the German proved to be decent . " Oh , God , " he said aloud . Angela . They would do it to Angela . He knew at once , the same way he had known when he had seen Bombolini on top of the water tower , that he would have to go to Santa Vittoria and be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found his heart was beginning to beat hard . He was excited , but his mind was clear and he knew exactly what he wanted to do . He got the rest of the way across the piazza without being seen and up into a dark narrow lane , and from this lane off into a series of lanes that kept him away from the Corso and the piazza but moving deeper into the city where the workingmen lived . He found the house he was looking for , and when his knock was not an-  | swered he tapped on the window , and when that went unanswered he was about to go away , when the shutter was opened by a young woman who did not seem to be wearing any clothes . Fabio looked down . " Oh , " he said . " I wanted Gambo . I was expecting Gambo . " " He is n't here , he 's in the hospital . A rock fell on him in the quarry . " Oh . I 'm sorry . " Fabio cleared his throat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use it whenever I needed it . " She said nothing , but tried to make him out in the darkness . " I need it . " " Stand'over here . Let me see you . " She made him come near to the window and she held his head up . " Wait here , " she said , and in a moment he could hear the chain coming down from the door . " Now come in . " When he went in he could see the bicycle chained to an iron ring in the stone staircase , and when he looked further into the room he could see the girl and was surprised to find that she was wearing only a shirt , one of Gambo 's shirts . He was startled by her legs , because he had never actually seen a woman 's legs before , and even more startled when he found he could see almost i all of her breasts , because the shirt was not buttoned all of the way to the top . He turned back to the bike . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always took good care of his bicycles . " The woman laughed and asked him who he was . " Fabio . Just call me Fabio . " " Just Fabio ? I ca n't loan a bike to someone called just Fabio , ' eh ? " " Bombolini . Fabio Bombolini , " he said . " From the Resistance . " She motioned him to come away from the door and into the room , and he looked at her quickly , because he had never seen anything like her , but when she sat down on the bed and turned back toward him he looked away again . The shirt was almost completely open . " How long have you known Gambo ? " " Oh , for years and years and years , " Fabio said . " How long has he been in the hospital ? " She leaned back on the bed , and Fabio could feel his heart pumping .  | " Oh , for weeks and weeks and weeks , " she said , and he blushed . They talked about Gambo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely knew him . " Why do n't you ever look at me ? " she said . " I 'm looking at you . " " No you 're not . What am I doing now ? " She was swinging a small key chain around and around . Her breasts were bare . " Why do you look away ? " " I 'm not looking away . I 'm looking at you . It 's just that I was interested in the bike . I came for the bike . " " The bike is more interesting than me ? " " It 's a beautiful bike , " Fabio said . The nature of the silence , the coldness behind it , informed Fabio that he would have to say more . " You seem beautiful , too , " he said . " Then look at me for God 's sake . " He took his eyes away from the bike and looked at her , as calmly he could , determined to examine her in all objectivity , as if she were in anatomy class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pounding of his heart must be making a sound in the room , and then he found that his right leg was shaking so that anyone could see it . " The key to the bike . See ? " She held up the key chain . " If you want it you can come and get it . " He had heard about things such as this . There would be a game to get the key . Sex games , his father had called them . He realized he would have to play , but he did n't know how to begin and he did n't know the rules . She ended this by bringing his hand to her neck so that he could feel the chain . " It 's thin , you see , but very strong , " she said . The game went swiftly enough after that , although it was a onesided game . She was expert at it . " Why are you trembling ? " she said , and he told her it was cold , although he was sweating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , which made it somewhat better . " What 's this ? " It was his holy medal . " St. Anthony of Padua . " " Take it off , " she told him . " I ca n't make love with a saint in between us . Your first time , eh ? "  | " Oh , no , " Fabio said ; but she laughed , nicely , at him . " You 'll have a good teacher , " she said . " That 's very important . You 're awfully old to be beginning . " I will think only of Angela while I do this , Fabio promised himself . No , no , no . I will think only of the bicycle . I will remember that I am doing this as a duty in order to get the bicycle . He was conscious of the woman but he did not allow himself to enjoy the consciousness . In a way , he was performing a patriotic act in the line of duty . " Well , " she said at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He wished she had n't said it , because it implied somehow that he had invested himself beyond the point of duty . " Someday you 'll make some woman a good lover . " He turned red , of course , and yet he found that he was n't displeased . " And I 'll tell you this , Fabio  --  Fabio what ? " " Della Romagna . " " I will tell you this , Fabio della Romagna : You may not be the best I 've ever had , but you 're the prettiest . " Despite himself , he found that he was smiling and could only hope that she had n't seen him smiling . " And one of the strangest . I think you are in love with bikes . " " Yes . I love bikes , " Fabio said , and he got up from the bed at once . He had forgotten the chain and the key , and when he turned back to her with such a sadness she laughed aloud and said , " Oh , God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head while he looked away . She has no shame at all , he thought . " When you bring it back we 'll have lesson number two , " she said . When he got the bicycle out into the steep narrow street he was filled with elation . The bicycle rattled on the cobbles , and so he picked it up and put it on his back , and he barely noticed its weight . Near the bottom of the lane he realized he would have to go back and went all of the way back . When he tapped on the window she opened it . She was naked again , but this time he looked directly at her . " My Saint Anthony medal , please . My mother would never forgive me . " When she came back with it Fabio was able to smile at her .  | " You 're not so bad at all , " he said . She started to close the shutter , but he held it with his hand . " One other thing , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . " " Gabriella . " " Gabriella . What a beautiful name . It is very fitting , " he said , and he trotted back down the narrow dark street . Fabio , he told himself , you are becoming a goat . When he reached Santa Vittoria some of the older men were still in the Piazza of the People , seated around the fountain , waiting to hear the cork clapper strike twelve . They could not feed enough on the sound . " Fabio . Oh , Fabio , " Bombolini said when he saw him . " I knew you would come back to me . " The mayor embraced him . " You 're sweating like a pig , Fabio . " " I pedaled all of the way up the mountain . I have bad news . " " What could be bad news ? " Bombolini said . " I want you to hear the good news first . Paolo , go and ring the bell for Fabio . I want him to hear it . " " No . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming . " Once again Fabio experienced the blankness of the faces that he had seen the other time . " I have seen the orders . Elements of the German army will arrive in Santa Vittoria at five o'clock in the afternoon on this coming Wednesday . " It meant nothing to them , even Bombolini . He threw his bicycle down onto the stones of the piazza . " All right . I 've told you . I have done my duty . I risked my life . I have stolen a man 's bike . I have done all that I can . " For a moment he had the wild idea of riding back to the arms of Gabriella , his lover ; but he was too tired . Bombolini came after him . " We know it 's important , Fabio . We appreciate your coming and telling us . It 's just that we have expected it all along and there 's nothing much to be done about it . " " You could put your women away some place . " " If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it . " " You could get that Abruzzi out of town before he gets us all shot . "  | " No , he 's going to stay . He 'll be dressed like one of us . No one will be able to tell . " " Do you think all these people can keep a secret like that ? " " We can be a very loud people , " Bombolini said , " but when it is to our advantage to keep a secret we can keep one . Keeping a secret is a form of lying you understand . " They were almost all the way across the piazza by then , and at the edge of the Corso Cavour , where it drops down from the Piazza of the People into Old Town , Bombolini took hold of Fabio 's arm . " Do n't go away again , Fabio , " he said . " We need you here . " " Oh , I do n't know . I 'm thinking of going into the mountains . " He had n't thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I shall go to the hills , Fabio told himself , and I shall stay in those hills even until I am the last one left , but I shall be unbowed . " When the Germans come , the policy here is going to be one of accommodation , do you understand ? " Bombolini said . Fabio made a face , but Bombolini did n't see it and did n't hear the sound of disapproval , because men generally seem to hear and see the things they wish to hear and see . " When they push , we will give . We 'll be like quicksand . " And I intend to be a rock , Fabio said , but to himself . " We do n't intend to be heroes here . We do n't want or need any heroes . We intend to do something a little better . We intend to survive . Thank you , Fabio , and now you get some rest . " He tried to answer the goodnight , but he could not force his lips to say the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ones of Petrarch he had memorized at the academy . Valor against fell wrath Will take up arms ; and then be the fight quickly sped . For sure the ancient worth that In Italians stirs the heart , is not dead . It was midnight . It had been a long day . He was tired . He had come back to save Angela , and they had no desire to save their women . So be it . They wanted to accommodate themselves to the Germans . So be it . The day had n't been all wasted . There was  | Gabriella , his lover . What was it she had said  --  someday you 'll make someone a good lover . If he had n't been concentrating so hard on the bicycle he probably could have shown her a thing or two . At last now he knew where his destiny rested . Up in the mountains . And just then , since it was twelve o'clock , the cork clapper began to ping against the metal of the bell , weak and thin and colorless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , " Fabio said aloud .  | ERGEANT Traub looked down in the Via San Sebastiano and shook his head . " It 's not very much equipment , sir , " he said . " It 's what the colonel would authorize , " Captain von Prum said . " It 's enough for our needs . " In the street below them , parked up against the walls of the ' louses across the way , was one small truck capable of holding four soldiers in the back and two in the front . They would have to find a way to fit two more in . Behind the truck was a motorcycle with a sidecar that appeared to have been used in the First World War . Behind the truck , as an afterthought , trailed a small , battered 2o-millimeter dual-purpose gun which had been designed  | for use against tanks and airplanes and people and which now was used mainly to frighten street mobs . " In Russia they would have authorized us three times as much : the sergeant said . " But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't Russians , are they ? " ' von Prum said . The soldiers nodded and one said , in a low voice , " And thank God for that . " " And we are n't going up there to wage war . " " That suits me , " Traub said . The captain looked at him closely . It was possible that the sergeant had lost his nerve in Russia , although his record showed that he had been a man of not just ordinary courage but unusual courage . The officer and his sergeant were still in the process of feeling one another out . " What do you think of the Italians ? " von Prum asked , in a very offhand manner . It was , however , a crucial question to him . He had chosen all of these men because of their understanding of Italian and it had been part of his reasoning that a man does n't learn another man 's language in order to despise him . " They 're all right , " Traub said . " They 're people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , " the sergeant said . " They want their supper like I do . " " And you , " von Prum said to Corporal Heinsick . " What about you ? " The corporal had been cleaning his equipment and his back was to Captain von Prum . The captain could see that he had hairs on the back of his neck like the bristles on the back of a boar . He had been cleaning a bayonet and it was cleaned and he slapped the blade against his knee and slid it into the scabbard with one harsh movement . There was violence in the man , a reservoir of anger , but it also seemed to be controlled . Von Prum had been worried about him . " The wop is all right , " he said . " In some ways I like the wop . I just have no respect for them . " One of the other soldiers nodded openly then . " That 's the word for it , sir  --  no respect . I saw them at Smolensk . They went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Russkies stopped and held and turned around , and you should have seen those sons of bitches come . Excuse me , sir . " " I 've been in barracks before . " " Those bright-green uniforms and those crazy hats with the feathers ! You never saw anything like it . " " They were fast though . You have to admit that , " Heinsick said . " You could have formed a fine Olympic squad from that bunch . I can live with them , I just got no respect for them . " When the others nodded , the captain was well pleased . It was what he had wanted to hear . " I am not one given to generalizations , " he told them , " but there are certain truths about certain peoples that simple observation will bear out every time . " And he told them what these were . The average Italian , he told them , had no stomach for battle . It was not so much a matter of courage as much as having nothing worth dying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruption ? " They all nodded . " A basic observation , then , is that the Italian , when given the chance , will at every turn choose to manipulate and bargain and make deals to protect what he has rather than fight for what he has . " " " They fought up at Castelgrande last night , sir , " Traub said , in a voice as respectful as he could make it . " They had five or six dead up there . " " And you missed four words I said , Sergeant , " Captain von Prum said . " What were they ? " When the sergeant was unable to answer the captain said them . " When given the chance . Do you understand now ? Captain Moltke marched into Castelgrande and began to take things without even asking for them . There was nothing for the people to do but to fight . That 's going to be the difference with us . We are n't going to take , they 're going to give . " It was a secondary part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he could get something in a straight and direct manner , wanted to get it by conniving for it . For a time , he said , this can produce results , or seem to produce results , but in the end , because the Italian lacks self-discipline , when conniving is pitted against a direct but disciplined opponent , conniving comes apart .  | " In one last word , then , every Italian scheme contains the seeds of its own destruction , the Italian himself . " He was n't sure that the men understood , but he knew they were impressed by his talk . " They had fifty men at Castelgrande , sir , " Traub said . " And we have eight , " von Prum said . " And eight is all we will need . But I want no man to go with me who has no confidence in me or in my approach . " They backed him with shouts of approval . He was moved to smile then . " This is the difference between them and us , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a bloodless victory , " Captain von Prum said , and he knew at once that this was the title of the report he would write . BLOODLESS VICTORY A technique for the conservation of manpower and equipment during the confiscation of enemy assets A report on the occupation of the city of Santa Vittoria under command of Sepp von Prum , Capt. , Inf . He even took time to write it down while the men were still standing about him . " The only red I expect to see is the red of their wine , " Captain von Prum told them . * * * When Fabio had gone and the bell had rung for the last time that night , Bombolini went back across the piazza , but all of the men had gone home . He turned toward the People 's Palace and then turned away because , although he was tired , he knew he could n't sleep then . He decided to walk through the city . He liked to walk through the city at night , because he thought of it then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They could sleep , because they knew he carried their burdens on his back . It was the price the leader paid and one he was happy to pay . He walked down past the Memorial Glade , and it was sad to look at the trees . During the other great war the people had  | planted one beech tree in a little plot of land for each man who had gone away to the war . Each tree carried the soldier 's name and a little picture of him . There was a belief that as long as the tree lived the soldier would live . But then people who had grievances against another family would sneak into the grove at night and cut down that family 's tree , or at least take off a limb in the hope that a member of the family would lose a leg or an arm at least . He went back up the Corso Cavour , because he knew he could sleep , and went inside the Palace of the People and to his room . Before going to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you think the Germans will come here ? " he said . Roberto was annoyed . It was three o'clock in the morning . " I do n't know . I do n't know about those things . I was in the air forces . " " There 's nothing for them here . " Roberto nodded . " Only your wine , " he said , and he was sorry to be disrespectful , but he closed his eyes and fell back to sleep . " There 's no road up here at all , " Bombolini said . But the sound of Roberto 's breathing told him that his argument was being wasted . " I 'm sorry . Sometimes I get to be a bore , " he said , and he went to his room and to bed . When he woke again the sun still had not risen and so he knew he could not have slept for more than an hour at the most . Something had been troubling him and he found a candle and a flint to light it with and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deceive themselves in great things while being scrupulous about the small ones . " He felt a cold hand rest on his heart and begin to squeeze it . He put the book over his heart as if that might stop it . He knew what the words meant . It was only that morning that Babbaluche had said to him , " We lie about the truth , that 's what ruins us here . And do you know why we lie about the truth ? Not because we like to , but because we are scared to death of it . If we looked the truth in the eye nine out of ten of us would run to the graveyard and demand to be buried at once . " He got up then and walked by Roberto 's room and was going to  | wake him but decided against it , even though it was Roberto who had seen the truth . Man sees what he sees and hears what he hears , he thought , and the few who do n't are generally considered to be mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the People where one of the madmen was already in the piazza , on his knees by the fountain , screaming at him , Bombolini . " You son of a bitch , " he was screaming . " Do something . Do it now . " It was Old Vines . Bombolini trotted across the rough stones . " Get up now , " he said . " I know . There 's no sense in terrifying the people before we have a plan . " Others had heard , however , the ones who get up in darkness before the sun even , and they were coming across the piazza . " Tell them the truth , " Old Vines shouted . " Do n't lie to us . " He got up from his feet then , his face as red as any wine he had ever aged , and turned to them . " The Germans are coming , " he shouted , " and they 're going to take our wine . " To the south there is an old Roman city that was buried in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ever seen it , people say that in this city there are figures of people who are locked forever in the ash at the moment of their doing . Those who were about to eat will forever be a spoon 's length away from eating and those just reaching for the wine will never taste it . It was this way in the piazza in Santa Vittoria that morning . When people heard the words , they recognized them as the truth at once and they seemed , for a time at least , to be turned into stone and to be so stiff that if they moved they would crack and fall into pieces on the stones . Bombolini was the first to move . He turned away and started back toward the Palace of the People . " They 're going to come and take our wine , " Old Vines screamed . The mayor continued to walk away from them as if he did n't hear . " What are you going to do ? " someone shouted . " What can we do ? " Bombolini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the stairs and woke Roberto .  | " You have to help me now . Do n't let anyone in . I must rest . I must go to sleep , " Bombolini said . " It 's all that I can do . " * * * Traub was one who rose with the sun . It was a habit that had begun on the family farm and continued with him into the army . He believed it was a sin to be down when the sun was up . " The early sun is gold in the mouth , " his mother said to him . " Yes , the bed is a thief , " his father would say . He was worried . In two day 's time they would be going up a mountain into an unknown city with one officer and two non-coms and six privates , all of them limited-duty soldiers because of previous wounds . He waited for an hour and finally knocked on Captain von Prum 's door . " I want to put a reconnaisance up in Santa Vittoria this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could hear that the captain was up but he was n't asked into the room because in the German army it was n't considered good for morale and discipline for soldiers to see their officers in their underwear . " No , " Captain von Prum said . " But the book says , sir , " Traub said . " I 'm not interested in the book . This is not a military problem . It 's a psychological problem . Do you understand that word ? " The sergeant said that he did . " I want to make the strongest possible first impression on these people . If we arrive there with nine men it will impress them . These people lay great store on first impressions . " " But , sir , if there 's a road block . . . " Von Prum opened the door of the room and looked at his sergeant . " The German army has not yet become a debating society , " von Prum said . Von Prum smiled , because the words had the same effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night before when Colonel Scheer shouted them at him . The colonel had had second thoughts about the wisdom of the bloodless victory . The bastard is making me pay in blood for my bloodless vie-  | tort ' , von Prum put in his log , but when the colonel summoned him he had gone at a run . " No , it all stinks of an experiment , " the colonel had said . " It 's all right to experiment with Poles . It 's all right to try things with Jews . It 's not all right with the grandson of Schmidt von Knoblesdorf . If anything happens to Captain von Prum , Willy Scheer will be the one to hang for it . " Scheer was a rare case , the peasant who had risen through the ranks to a position of power without discarding his peasant ways . His manner was rough and direct , his speech was filled with folk sayings , most of them coarse , and he looked as if he had been carved from a potato . It amused him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " No , I ca n't let you go , " Scheer said . " The cream of our culture , the flower of our people . " He was being sarcastic but good natured . " If your name was Schwartz you could go . But a blood relation of Alfons Mumm von Schwarzenstein ? Oh , no . It 's not your ass I worry about , it 's Willy Scheer 's ass . " The captain had stared at him . Von Prum knew it was the correct thing to do then . For reasons he did n't understand , Scheer enjoyed being stared at in a cold haughty manner . " You look at me as if I was manure in the field , " he said . " Like I was shit . " But he smiled . " You heard what happened at Castelgrande , " the colonel said . " They went in with fifty men . " " And Moltke , " von Prum said . Captain Moltke was famous for his short temper . When he had encountered a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the people of the town and they had no choice but to fire back . " Well take a tank at least , " Scheer said . The captain shook his head and continued to stare at the colonel . " What are you going armed with , " he finally asked . " The culture of the German people , " von Prum said . " Our national sense of purpose . Our genius at working with disciplined order . " " Oh you are such a good boy , " Scheer said . " My God what a fine noble boy . " He was shaking his head by then . " Do you really believe this . "  | " I really believe it , " von Prum said . " It is n't the idealist 's way . It is n't the dreamer 's way . It 's the only sensible , practical way to do it . You 'll see . " These were the words that angered the colonel and this was when he told the captain that the army had not yet become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the rules Scheer had had to learn so painfully in his life . " You listen to me , " Scheer said . " We do n't learn much in the turnip fields but we learn some things that are never forgotten , and one of them is that the one thing that gets respect , the only thing that gets respect , is strength . The weak respect the strong for one reason . Because they 're not weak like themselves . " The colonel thumped his hard brown stubby hand down onto the hard wooden table . " Here 's one of those quaint peasant sayings , Captain von Prum . One must be either the anvil or the hammer . ' You think about it . There is no other way . " But in the end von Prum had won , as he knew he would win , because in the end he was what the race aspired to , and he knew this and knew that Scheer knew it and approved of it . His Nordic bleaching , as the colonel called it , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not just the symbol of racial purity but the fact of it . Most Germans , like most of the people of the world , are dark and short , but unlike other people the Germans despise their darkness and their shortness and they do n't believe in it . It is von Prum they put on all their posters , and when they have a baby it is von Prum they hope to produce . " You push me too Goddamn hard , " Scheer said , " but then again the German army has not yet become a place where officers go back on their words . " They smiled at one another then . " Take a tank , " Scheer said . Von Prum shook his head . " My God you 're stubborn , " Scheer said . His voice became hard again . " This experiment has only one solution , and that is that it must work . " " I understand . " " If it does n't , I come up there and do things in my way , " Scheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm committed for that wine . "  | " You will get your wine . " The colonel began to walk toward the door of his office and by this the captain knew the interview was over . " I want the wine , I want it soon , and I want all of it . " He stopped at the door . " When you are ready you let us know , make it soon , and we will come and get the wine . " " But that 's all part of it , " von Prum said . " When the time comes I intend to have the people bring it out themselves . " " You expect the people to collaborate in their own robbery , " he said . His voice was bitter . " Yes , " von Prum said , so quietly and with such little doubt that his arrogance finally caused the colonel to laugh aloud . " You know one thing that is n't right for a Schmidt von Knoblesdorf ? " He ran his stubby fingers down the front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . No decorations . " It had bothered von Prum 's father . Once he had even offered to lend the captain several of his before they went to church . " I will tell you what I will do , " Colonel Scheer said . " If you can get the people of this place . . . what 's the name ? " " Santa Vittoria . " " If you get these people to bring their own wine to the railroad here I will recommend you for the Iron Cross . " Von Prum smiled at this . " Third class , of course , " Scheer said , " but an Iron Cross nevertheless . " The captain was excused then , but at the foot of the stairs he turned back to the colonel . " As for you , " he called up , " I 'll put your name on the cover of the Bloodless Victory . " " No , to hell with that , " Scheer said . " After the war you invite me to your home for dinner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled his hard tough smile . " Have me with that fellow you 're always quoting . " Von Prum was puzzled . " Nitcha , " Scheer said . " Your friend Nitcha . " " Nietzsche , " the captain said . " He 's dead . " " Oh , I 'm sorry to hear it , " Colonel Scheer said . " Have me with all the ancestors then . "  | " I 'll do that , " Captain von Prum said . " And I 'll toast you in the wine of Santa Vittoria. " * * * Considering the state of things in Santa Vittoria they were good to Bombolini ; they allowed him to sleep until eleven o'clock , and then they told Roberto to go and wake him . When he looked in the door he was surprised to see how peacefully the mayor was sleeping . " They 're waiting for you down there , " Roberto told him . " Yes , I know that . I can sense them . " " The whole piazza is filled with people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They do n't have their leader . " The mayor rose from the bed and moved very slowly and easily , and the manner in which he moved convinced Roberto that he must have found an answer during his sleep . " The Grand Council is downstairs . " " I can sense them , " Bombolini said . " I can feel them . I can smell them . They say a horse can smell water before he can see it when he needs it . I can smell them and they can smell me . Do you know what I did , Roberto ? " " No . " " I had a good sleep . " He tapped his head and at the same time attempted to brush down his mane of hair , which was wild , so wild that Babbaluche once claimed that a bird could nest in it and Bombolini would never know it until he got egg on his face . " God came to me , I think . He put something in here . Let 's go down . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the members of the Grand Council were gathered . " God put a story in my head . I want to tell it to you and you can tell me what it means . I think the answer is in the story . " They sat down along the walls and stood against the walls , and Italo Bombolini told them the story of the peasant Gagliaudi. * * * A thousand years ago , some invaders from the north called barbarians came to conquer Italy under the leadership of a man named Barbarossa . Everything fell before the barbarians until  | they came to one walled city to the north of here that refused to lie down and surrender . They tried everything to make it fall , but when they failed they decided to surround the city and starve it out . Winter came and the people began to go hungry and everyone knew it was only a matter of time . It was then that the peasant Gagliaudi went to the prince with a plan . " Give me all the wheat that is left in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I will save the city . If I do n't , then kill me . " " Do n't worry , I wo n't have to do that . They 'll do it for me . " But against his better judgment , because there was nothing else to do , he gave the wheat and the grain to the peasant . The people were shocked and outraged when the peasant began to feed the precious food to his cow . " Now bring me the last of the water , " Gagliaudi ordered . The people by then were chewing stones to keep their mouths wet , but the cow drank and drank . " Now bring me the last of the wine . " They watched in rage as the peasant sat before them and drank the last of the wine and got drunk before their faces . When he was drunk enough , early in the morning just before dawn , a little side gate in the wall was opened and the drunk peasant and his bloated cow slipped outside the city 's walls . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gagliaudi began to sing and laugh and roar , and he kicked the cow so that it mooed and bellowed in protest . The enemy could not believe their eyes any more than the people of the city , who were peeping from the tops of the walls , could believe theirs . " We have been made fools of , " they all agreed . The guards of Barbarossa realized at once that only a madman or a drunk could behave in this manner , and when they seized the peasant he fell to his knees . " Oh God help me , what have I done ? " He wept . He cried aloud . " I was taking my cow to the grainery and I opened the wrong door . Oh , do n't harm me . Please . Take me to Barbarossa . I have a proposition for him . " They dragged the weeping drunk to the warrior , and he looked with astonishment at the drunk man and the fat sleek cow .  | " I have a proposition for you , " Gagliaudi said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm me . " " Italians always have propositions , " Barbarossa said . " It 's how we survive , " the peasant said . " We 're weak . But if you will let me go I will promise to go back inside the walls with any soldiers you select and bring you back my twelve cows . " " Twelve like this ? " " No , not like this . " He kicked the fat cow . " Twelve that are fat and filled with meat and milk . Not this beast . I was treating her , sir . Ca n't you see ? She 's sick . " It was Barbarossa who was sick , sick at the sight of all of that beef on the hoof . " Do you mean to tell me you have twelve more like that inside the walls ? " " Only my own , sir . Just my own . All of the others belong to someone else and I ca n't give them to you . " Barbarossa was above all things a good soldier , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city clearly had enough food to last them for two more years at least . That afternoon he packed up his army and he left . The city was saved . * * * They all looked at one another . It seemed to be saying something to them . The answer was in the story , everyone felt that . " It 's in there , " Bombolini shouted to them . " Otherwise why would He have put it there , eh ? " But they were silent . It was a strange story ; every man in the room felt that the answer was flitting about inside his brain waiting to fly out on his tongue , but when it came time to open the mouth nothing came out . " It 's like those parables in the Bible , " someone said . " Just when I seem to understand and have it in my hands it hops away from me . " They looked at each other as if by staring very hard into one another 's eyes they would unlock the answer in their minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of the bell telling that it was midday , and no one in the room was any closer to the secret of Gagliaudi.  | " To hell with all this , " Pietro Pietrosanto suddenly shouted . " To hell with this bum and his cow . I say fight . " There was a cheer from the others . Their minds were tired from the pressure of the thinking , and the idea of fighting seemed good then . At least it was doing something . " I say dig in down in the rocks by the big bend in the road in the terraces and the sons of bitches will never get us out . " Another cheer . " Sometimes you make people spill a little blood for what they want , and you find they do n't want it so much any more . " The problem with Bombolini was that he was torn between voices . Men often deceive themselves in believing that humility can overcome insolence . Any way that you read that , it meant to resist , to fight . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The German who touches my wine or my wife pays for his touch in blood . " A very big cheer then . And yet The Master had also said : Cunning and deceit will every time serve a man better than force . Bombolini was confused and , even worse , he began to feel a kind of fear dancing in the back of his mind like cold needles , like the sun , cold and brilliant , on ice . The Master was failing him . " Fabio was right , he was the one who knew , " another young man was now shouting . " What good is it to save yourself and then crawl around your own country like a dog looking for a bone ? " " Mussolini was right . Better to live one day as a lion than one hundred years as a lamb . " A great cheer then and the eyes turned on the mayor , because it was he who had painted out the sign . All these brave words , these cries of valor . How to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Machiavelli : Deceit in the conduct of war outweighs valor and is worthy of merit . How could that be explained to them ? Flow to tell a bunch of men bent on becoming heroes that it would be more heroic of them to practice being cowards ? Just as Fabio had once been saved by Babbaluche , now Tommaso Casamassima , Rosa Bombolini 's uncle , stood up in the room  | and struck the floor with his mulberry stick until there was silence . " You forget who you are , " he shouted . " You forget where you come from . You think you 're warriors and you shout like heroes and you are a bunch of grape growers . " There was silence , because everyone knew what Tommaso said was so . " A bunch of grape growers . " Silence . " We have no heroes here . This is no country for heroes . If you want to be martyrs , go be martyrs somewhere else . We ca n't afford martyrs in Santa Vittoria . " Silence . " Tend to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one lesson that every Santa Vittorian has known for the last thousand years : Brave men and good wine do n't last long . " * * * Everyone went outside after that . All idea of the fight was ended . The people were waiting for them in the piazza . " We 're thinking . Do n't worry . We 're coming up with something . " As if it were a command , they began to go across the Piazza of the People and down the Corso Cavour to the Cooperative Wine Cellar . In the absence of anything to do they were making a pilgrimage and performing an act of faith in the wine , the way people in other places might go into a church and pray for guidance . They filed in through the narrow door , into the cool dimness and smelt the incense of the cellar , that sweet sharp smell of the herbs that go into the vermouth , and went down through the tiers of wine which look like tall pews in an attitude of reverence . It is a true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea held in bottles . To the south of here there are towns where people make the sign of the cross over each crust of bread before they eat it , and we are the same way with the wine . To say something loud or vulgar , to utter an obscenity in the presence of the wine , would be the same as urinating in a cathedral . The sight of so much wine ,  | all that wine to be stolen , was too great for Bombolini to bear , and he went out of a little-used side door and back up a narrow back lane until he reached the piazza and the Palace of the People and found Roberto . " Have you figured out the story yet ? " he said . Roberto looked puzzled . " The dream . My dream . What does it mean ? You 're the American . You know everything . " He was shouting at Roberto , but then he stopped and sat down . " What are you doing ? " " Arithmetic . My arithmetic . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want to know . He preferred it that way . Without any plan it was better to just let them come when they came , unprepared for and unannounced . " All right , " he said finally . " How many . " " They 'll be here in fifty-three hours . " When he heard the hour now it began to flash in his mind in large block letters , as bright and clear as the lights on the theater in Montefalcone , flashing on and off ? 53 . . . 53 . . . 53 53 ? and it was minutes before the glow of the lights would leave his brain . Ile went to the window of Roberto 's room and looked down at the people standing in the midday sun in the piazza , and he looked at the wall and at a picture of St. Sebastian being rent with arrows . " Quick , now . As fast as you can say the words . If you were me what would you do with the wine ? " " Hide . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You would hide it ? " " Yes , hide it , " Roberto said . " Oh , Roberto . So simple and clean and beautiful that it 's almost stupid , " the mayor said , and he struck Roberto such a blow on the arm that it was weeks before the American could raise it without feeling pain .  | 0 N THAT same afternoon , Captain von Prum wrote this , the second letter to his brother Klaus . Klaus : You falter , you lose sight again . I cease to preach to you . Do n't take a brother 's word , take instead the words of a man you profess to admire . " You say it is the good cause that hallows even war . I say unto you : It is the good war that hallows any cause . " Need I say more , Klaus ? " It is a sad fact , but a fact , that war and courage have accomplished more great things than love of thy neighbor . Not your pity but your courage will save the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then .  | " What is good ? " you ask . " To be brave is good . " Your men were not brave , Klaus , and for that they paid the price , as any evil person must pay . I finish with Nietzsche . " What matters long life ? What warrior wants to be spared ? " Your brother , Sepp Klaus : We move out within two days , as I intimated to you . I have my duty , you have your duty . Wish me luck , Klaus , even as I wish you the same . * * * The effort to hide the wine was a failure . Within the first half hour of the experiment , before twenty thousand bottles had been taken from the Cooperative Wine Cellar and brought up into the Piazza of the People it was clear to anyone who wished to see it that the experiment was no longer worth going on with . But people sometimes are more willing to go on with the work than face up to the failure . They piled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hide them in their houses . They put them in closets and under beds and behind pictures and in the backs of fireplaces and then in the drains and on the roofs and under loose tiles and then in the manure piles and on grapevine hung down the chimneys . " Keep the wine in the shadows , the sun is bruising it , " Old Vines shouted at the people . " Would you put a newborn baby in the sun ? This wine is n't even born yet . Do n't shake the wine . Would you shake a newborn baby ? This wine is n't born yet . " Sometime in the early afternoon Bombolini summoned the courage to ask the keeper of the wine how many bottles remained to be hidden , and when Old Vines told him , it was a matter of several minutes before he could make himself hear the figures , and when he did he wrote them on a card ? " 1,32o,000 . " Each time he looked at the number he found it hard to comprehend . He held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , as if somehow , if he twisted it in enough ways , the value of the numbers might change . Even if they hid ioo , 000 bottles , which  | was impossible , it was only one thirteenth of the wine and by enormous effort they would have achieved nothing . At four o'clock there was to be an inspection of the hiding , and the teams went out even though all of the people knew what they would report . A few minutes later the first of them came back . " It 's no good , Captain . It is n't working right , " Longo 's son said . " You can see bottles everywhere . Everytime you turn around in the Pietrosanto house you sit on a bottle , you step on a bottle , you break a bottle . The beds are lumpy with bottles . " It was the same everywhere . " Bring the bottles back out , " Bombolini ordered , and he felt at that moment the dread of failure . To the credit of the people he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He went back across the piazza , passing the bottles piled on the cobblestones and piled in carts , seeing and not seeing at the same time the people going into the houses and starting to bring the wine back out . He had the weight of the city and of one thousand people and now one million bottles of wine to carry . It was too much for any one man , he thought . He felt someone pulling on him and he turned to look . It was Fungo , the idiot . It is said that when a man is drowning , just as he goes down , he will grab at a twig in the water and for that moment really believe that it will hold him ; and so , at this moment , Bombolini stopped to listen to Fungo . " I have something to tell you , " Fungo said . " Tell . Tell me . " Out of the mouths of babes and idiots and drunks ? Who could tell until he listened ? " Tufa 's back , " the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have a filthy mouth , " the boy said . " Excuse me . How do you know ? " The boy told him how he had gone to Tufa 's house to see if he could find any bottles and he had found Tufa there , in the dark , lying on the floor . " He 's dying , " Fungo said . " How would you know that ? " " Someone told me. "  | " Who ? " " Tufa . And he should know . " I will attend to Tufa , he thought . It was at least something positive to do . I will make every effort to save Tufa 's life . He thought for a moment that he was crying , and then he looked up and was surprised to see that it was raining . The people were running past him , getting out of the piazza before the full force of the rain reached them . The people here love the rain and they love to see it rain . It is not going too far to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they see a drop they run from it . Old Vines caught up to Bombolini . " Stop them , " he shouted . " You have to order them to stay . We ca n't leave the wine out here . The rain will wash the dust from the bottles . The rain will chill the wine . " Bombolini looked at the old man as if he came from some other town . " Who cares ? " he said . " Do we have to have the wine at room temperature for the Germans when they come ? " " Wine is wine no matter who has it , " the old man shouted . " To abuse wine is to abuse life itself . " Now he was shaking Bombolini by the shoulders and shouting something about killing him . " Then fuck the wine , " Bombolini said . Old Vines fell away from him . " Oh , you sin , " he said . Neither of them felt the rain that was falling hard by then . " You sin against the wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to strike me in the heart , Bombolini thought . He pushed the cellar master to one side and started down the Corso Cavour to Old Town and Tufa 's mother 's house . He had made up his mind to keep all of his thoughts on Tufa . There were strange things about Tufa . He was , for one , an officer in the army , and that should have separated him from the people here , but it did n't . Even worse , he was a Fascist , but this had never stopped him from being a hero to the young people here and a person to whom the old were not afraid to turn for help when he was home . The thing about Tufa was that he was a true Fascist , a real Fascist , who believed all the glorious words and tried to follow  | them , and that had made him a very strange person here and in all of Italy . As a young boy he had been chosen from all the rest in Santa Vittoria to go away and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every word he heard at the camp . Later he became a soldier and after that was made an officer in the Sforzesca , one of the aristocratic regiments , a very rare thing to happen . When he came home on leave people would go to him and ask him to intercede for them with The Band or with the Fascists in Montefalcone . " What is this I hear you are doing to Baldisseri ? " he would ask them . " Only Communists would do a thing like that . " It must have been a mistake , they always told him , and it would certainly not happen again . " Well of course not , " he would say . " We do n't do things like that . " " No , we do n't , " they would say . They were afraid of the innocence in his eyes and the anger that could replace it . He was a believer in a nation of nonbelievers , people who believe that to believe in anything is dangerous and even evil itself , since believing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . None of the Fascists in the region could wait for Tufa 's leaves to be over , and they breathed easier when he was gone and hoped to God that he would meet a glorious end in Albania or Greece or Africa . The room was dark and it felt wet and it was dirty . It smelled bad . Tufa 's mother had never been able to run a house . " Where is he ? " Bombolini asked . The soldier 's mother pointed to one end of the room , where the mayor could eventually make out Tufa 's shape lying on the floor facing the stone wall . " He 's going to die , " the mother said . " I can see it in his eyes . All the life is gone . " Bombolini crossed the room and stood over Tufa 's body , not knowing what to say to him . Tufa had never liked him because he had been a clown and Tufa did n't understand clowns . With a terrible slowness Tufa turned away from the wall and looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I have always despised you . " The mother was wrong about the eyes . There was the recogni-  | tion of death in them , but there was also hatred , which had not been seen there before , and beneath both of these a kind of terrible hurt . " You had better get out , " the mother said . " He means what he says . He always means what he says . " " Tufa ? Can you hear me ? " " Get out of here . " " I 'm not a clown any more , Tufa . I 'm the mayor here now . Can you hear me ? Can you understand that ? " " Get out of here . " The hatred was so strong that it defeated Bombolini . He backed out of the house and stood in the Corso Cavour and allowed the rain to fall on him until his hair was streaming with water . The people looked at him from the doorways . Now there was n't even Tufa as a reason for existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the piazza , Pietro Pietrosanto came down the steps toward him . " We ca n't put it off any longer , " Pietrosanto said . " We 've got to do something with The Band . " Bombolini took in a large breath . Pietro was correct , the time had come . It was the one problem he had been unable to face since the day he had taken office . He knew the words of The Master : " Men must either be caressed or annihilated and the injury must be such that the victim can not pay you back for it . Whoever acts otherwise is obliged to stand forever with knife in hand . " At night he could hear the words tumbling through his mind and he would resolve in the darkness to do something about them , but in the morning when the sun lit the walls along the piazza and the people went down to work , another day would pass with the problem unanswered . Now , with the Germans coming , there was no room left for the luxury of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Pietrosanto found this hard to believe . " I am tired of standing with my knife in my hand . " " I do n't understand you , " Pietro said . Bombolini took Pietrosanto by the arm . " Do you have a rifle ? You own a rifle , do n't you ? " " Shoot them ? Is that what you mean ? Shoot the sons of bitches ? "  | " I do n't mean to caress them , " the mayor said . " Come . " They both went back up toward the piazza . " Try and look as if we have a plan , " Bombolini said , " It gives the people heart . " It had stopped raining . It had been a good drenching rain . As Old Vines had feared , the rain had washed all of the dust off the backs of the dark-green bottles , and in the greyness of the light the wetness caused them to sparkle as if the stones of the piazza were strewn with jewels . " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hear him . Now that he had ordered the final solution to the problem of The Band it did n't concern him any more . He looked instead at the wine . " What do you think they would think if they were to come now ? " Bombolini said . " That we were trying to butter them up . That it was a gift for them . " He was probably right , the mayor thought . " They 'd take it as their due , " Pietro said . " It 's the way they are . " " Yes , that 's how they are , " Bombolini agreed .  | THAT EVENING Bombolini asked Roberto to go and ask the Malatesta to take a look at Tufa . " She 'll listen to you , " Bombolini said . " You 're not from here , and she thinks you 're brave . " " She does n't think I 'm brave , " Roberto said . " She thinks I 'm afraid of pain . " " Ah , but that 's just it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you acted to it makes you a brave man , " he said . " Besides , I think she has an eye for you . She thinks you 're handsome . " " How do you know ? " " I heard her say so once . " It was a lie , a complete and shameless lie , which Roberto recognized as a lie and treated as one , and yet it made his heart beat faster . Despite himself , the heart beat faster .  | He dressed and went into the rain and crossed the Piazza of the People . It was the first time he had seen all the bottles in the piazza . At the wineshop he decided to stop and get some cheese before making the hard climb up to High Town and when he thought of facing the Malatesta he ordered a full bottle of wine as well . " What 's all the wine doing in the piazza ? " he asked Rosa Bornbolini . " Do you think I know ? Do you think I care ? Do you think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ? " He determined never to ask her a question again . When he came out it was dark and he felt a little drunk from the wine , but it made the ache in his bone feel better . At the street that runs up into High Town someone whispered his name . It was Fabio . " I thought you were up in the mountains . " Roberto said . " I am in the mountains . Five of us . The Petrarch Brigade , formally . The Red Flames , informally . " He named four young boys who were with him , none of whom was over fifteen years of age . " They 're young , but they can fight , " Fabio said . " They also are hungry . " With some of his own money and some of Fabio 's , Roberto went back to the wineshop and bought two loaves of bread for the Red Flames . " Now you do a favor for me , " Roberto said . He made Fabio go with him to face Caterina Malatesta . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . " How is she ? " Fabio said at last . " Who ? " " Angela , " Fabio said . " I do n't know . I have n't seen her . That 's why I was buying cheese . She does n't bring us our meals . " " I suppose you two have a lot of fun together when he is n't around . " " Angela and me ? " " Yes , Angela and you . A lot of fun together , if you know what I mean . " " Oh no , nothing like that . Angela is n't like that . " Fabio made a sound like a mule . " They 're all like that , " he said .  | " Do n't tell me . I know them from top to bottom . Put a grape basket over their heads and turn them upside down and ? " " Oh , do they say that here , too ? We say Put a sack over their heads : " Caterina lived in the next to the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . * * * Neither one of them wanted to knock on the door , but it was Fabio who finally did it , and when she came to the door and opened it they were surprised to see her . She was wearing long slender pants and little slippers and a sweater that revealed the outline of her breasts . None of these things are worn by the women here , even today . She had pulled her hair back and tied it with a scarf the way the peasant women do , and yet it looked nothing like a peasant 's . She did n't wish to come and she resisted , but Fabio was persuasive and there is something about Tufa , even to those who had barely known him , that was special . She got a raincoat that looked like the kind of coat army officers wear , and she went with them down the dark winding back lane into Old Town . She did n't knock at the door of the house , but opened it and went in and put down the medical bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bag and when it was lit she could sec Tufa , not lying down any longer but propped up against the wall looking at her the way a wolf looks at someone coming for him from the back of a cave . In the light his teeth were as bright as his eyes , and he looked very sane and very mad at the same moment , like someone who could kill or become a martyr with equal ease . He frightened Roberto . He had never before seen a man who seemed to burn . Caterina had known him from when she was a girl , but when she saw him she made a sound , a stifled sound of astonishment . She was not able to take her eyes away from him . " You are hurt , " she said . " You are n't going to touch me . " Tufa has the finest voice in the city , sweet and yet strong . Sometimes it sounds as if Tufa was whispering through the pipe of an organ .  | " You 're badly hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die , but your body wo n't allow you to . " He said nothing . " It 's the fate of your kind , " she said . " My kind die easily . " All of this while Caterina kept moving toward him . Somewhere in this book it tells of thunderbolt love , but this was something different . There was an awareness of each other that was so acute and powerful and immediate that it went beyond anything we know as love . It is an understanding of each other so immediate and so total that there is nothing they do n't know about one another and they are able to share things with each other at once , even in front of others , that they have never been able to share with anyone before . They have always known each other , at once . Some people feel that this is proof that people must have lived before , people such as this are playing out again a love affair from some other age . Except for one thing : There is no love ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , and nothing else exists . The attraction supplants all else , and yet there is no love , not even any tenderness , only the attraction and the understanding of one another . They are like vacuums , and when they meet the crack is formed and they rush into each other , each into the other , the souls are sharing one another , the way the wind rushes into the wine cellar when the door is swung ajar . When she touched him he stiffened . She did n't move her hand for a moment , but then she began to take off the officer 's jacket he wore to examine the wounds in his chest and upper arms that he had received the week before from an exploding grenade . " They told me you were a good man , " she said . Roberto brought her the medical bag . " How can you be a Fascist and a good man at the same time ? " For a long time Tufa said nothing , but it did n't seem to bother her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounds . " You can be , " he said at last , " if you are a fool . " Caterina finished dressing the last of the wounds . Most of them were not deep , but several of them were infected and the flesh was ragged around them .  | " You 're not going to get better here , " the Malatesta said . " You 're going to have to get out of this room . " " Where are you going to take him ? " Tuf a 's mother asked . " He ca n't go to the hospital . " " Some place where he can get better . " The mother got up from the box she sat on and began collecting her son 's things . " I do n't want him dying in here , " she said . " Besides , you know what I have to feed him ? " She tapped the side of an earthen pot . " I have ten or twelve olives . I ca n't count . I have one piece of bread and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Tufa . " Do you want to go with me ? " " Oh , yes . You know that , " he said , and he began to get to his feet . When she helped him she was surprised to find that he was silently crying . " The first time , " he said . " The first time ever . " He did n't know why he cried , but he was n't ashamed of the tears . Later he was able to figure that he cried because he was giving up the death he had planned for himself and he knew that he was going to have to enter again into the life that had fooled him so terribly and that he had wanted to give up . He went past his mother and out into the Corso Cavour , where Fabio and Roberto were waiting in the rain . " You do n't say goodbye to your mother ? " " No , we do n't do that in this family , " Tufa said . Tufa , although he was weak and sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way it is in this town . He was forced to lean against the walls and gasp for breath , but he led the way up . Finally he had to lean on Caterina . " I apologize for that , " he said . " You do n't have to apologize to me , " she said , and it caused both of them to laugh because it was a truth , and when you hear the truth it makes you laugh . They had at the moment recognized the truth between them : because they knew everything about each other , they would never have to apologize to each other and they would never have to or be able to apologize for themselves . At the Fountain of the Pissing Turtle , although the rain was  | falling heavily , Tufa was forced to stop and sit on the wet edge of the fountain . " I like this rain . It 's been a long time since I 've been in a real rain . " " You were in Africa ? " " There and Sicily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain to run down his face , and she was able to see how beautiful his eyes were , the thick lashes , the dark brows , the large soft brownness of the eyes themselves . It was said that every woman in Santa Vittoria was jealous of Tufa for his eyes . " I can feel the dust of Africa washing off me , " he said . It made Caterina laugh , and she could see that it hurt him . " Why do you laugh ? " he said . His voice was annoyed . " Oh , it sounded so dramatic . You must go to a lot of movies . " " I never go to movies . " He was silent after that . He let the rain wash down his neck , and then he lifted his face to it once more . " The other officers in my mess were always laughing at the things I said , and I never knew why . " He looked at her . " You 're like them . " He did n't say it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fact . " Not inside , maybe , but like them . " It was , she knew , a matter of class , the education of people who were trained to respond to innocence with scorn or anger because they were terrified of what innocence might see . Although she understood him , there were things she would have to do differently . " Do you think we can go ? " She was becoming chilled and wet . " In a moment . " " Then tell me the story of the fountain while we wait . " Tufa looked up at the fountain and smiled , and it was the first time she had seen him smile . She had seen him laugh , but a laugh is something different from a smile . " It 's an old story and not a nice one , " Tufa said . " I think I can bear it . " " It 's very dirty . " " You 're apologizing . " " No , I 'm warning you . " He took her hand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk across the piazza once again . " I do n't think  | I 'm going to tell you . Do n't you know that that story is told to women who are thirty years old and who no longer are virgins ? " " I qualify then , " Caterina said . He gripped her arm then , very hard , so hard that it took her by surprise and hurt her . " No you do n't , " he said . " I know when you were born . " She was amazed by this . " Your father gave my father a cup of wine , a tin cup of wine and some coins , on the day you were born , " Tuf a said . " Do you think I would forget that ? " " Yes . " " " My father did n't want them . He was insulted . And when my mother heard my father had turned down the money she made me go up to your house and tell your father that my father was wrong , that there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . " " And you were ashamed . " " Of course I was ashamed . Everyone laughed . They never heard of such a thing before . So they gave me the cup of wine and put the coins in my pocket and then they put a chicken around my neck for my father . " He was silent , and she said nothing . There was no reason to apologize for her father , and both of them knew that . " He never forgave my mother and he never forgave me , " Tufa said . " We ate the chicken and he sat there and looked at us and went hungry . Then he went away and never came back . I was eight then . Do you think I would forget ? " " No . " " I was eight and I am thirty-four now , and that makes you twenty-six , " he said . " Why did you do that to my arm , grip me like that ? " " I do n't want any lies . Even little lies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll try not to tell any lies , " Caterina said . " I do n't know if it will be easy or not . I do n't think I ever tried before . " At the end of the piazza they came upon the last of the rows of wine . " What the hell is all this ? " Tufa said . " The Germans are coming . " She could feel his body stiffen and then relax once more . " They were trying to hide the wine . "  | " How do you know ? " " The mayor here , what 's his name ? The fat man . Bombolini . Italo Bombolini . He used to run the wineshop . " " I refuse to believe that that fat bastard is the mayor here , " Tufa said . " Does that telling lies apply to yourself as well ? Because he is the mayor . The Captain of the People they call him . " " 0 God ! 0 Maria ! " Tufa said , and both of them were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rain . " No , I believe you , " he said . " This is the work of some kind of idiot . " They went up the long hill and it was midnight when they reached the door to the Malatesta house and Tufa stopped to regain his breath before going inside it . " I never thought I would go inside here again , " Tufa said . " I never thought I would go inside of my own choice . " He hesitated at the door . " I never ate chicken again . I have never had a piece of chicken in my mouth from that day , " he said , but then he went through the door . It was cold inside and dark and when Caterina managed to light the little lamp that was fed by ox fat she found that Tufa was trembling from cold and wet and from exhaustion . The lamp light made the room seem warmer , but he could not control his shaking . " Take off your cothes and get into that bed , " Caterina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not used to taking orders , " he said . He made no move of any kind . " Do you want me to turn away ? " " Of course . " He sounded annoyed . " Of course . " She waited until she heard him get into the bed before turning around . Next to the bed was a small porcelain stove that had been brought to Santa Vittoria by some Malatesta from some foreign place when there was money . There was no fuel for the fire , but she burned the stump of a broom and it gave good light , and for a while it heated the room . She found a bottle of anisette and the  | liquor warmed them both , but there was not enough of it to sustain them and he wanted to talk to her . " I 'll borrow a bottle , " she said . When she returned he was asleep , but he awoke at once when she came back through the door . She had a bottle of good vermouth and she uncorked it and handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Tufa said . " Oh , you went back down ? " He shook his head . " They would have hung you from the fountain by your heels if they had caught you . " The story Tufa had to tell is not an uncommon one in Italy , although it is possible that Tuf a would tell it with greater hurt than most of the others , since Tufa has more pride than most . The story is the same , over and over , only the facts are different and the names and the places . He had wanted to be a good soldier and a good Italian . He had wanted to act with courage , he had wanted to keep his integrity and live with honor . It was n't a great deal to ask of a state , to be able to serve it and to live and even die for it like a man . But they would n't allow that , although Tufa was n't prepared to admit it . He lied to himself about the failures in Albania and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to die for a cause they could n't believe in , but which he could not make himself admit was not worth dying for . Through his example , young men , for him alone as a man , stood and fought and were maimed or killed for it . And then one night , in North Africa , near Bengasi , some of the men , his own men , shot him in the back . " I 'm sorry , " the one who did the shooting said . " We have to do this to save ourselves . " Even then he was n't willing to admit everything to himself . When he rejoined his regiment in Sicily the soldiers were frightened by the officer who was so brave that he would kill them to prove it . During the first attack his men deserted . " We stay , " Tufa had shouted at them . " The others run . We stay . We stand like men , we go down like men . " But they ran . They ran at him and past him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to do before , and they kept running , and for the first time he lowered the rifle and knew that they were  | right and he was wrong and that to shoot them would be to murder them . That night he himself ran , across Sicily in the night , to the Straits of Messina , where he used the rifle to force a fisherman to take him to the mainland , and he had run in the night like some wounded animal trying to make his way back to his den to lick his wounds in secrecy and darkness or to die . When he was through the fire had gone out and the house was cold again and it was Caterina who was shivering . " I 'm going to have to come to bed . I hope you will allow this , " Caterina said . It was a matter of courtesy only . " There is no choice , is there ? " She took off her clothes and came to the bed , and neither of them said anything after that . Tufa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tiredness and from the story he had told . The heat of her body warmed him and calmed him and the trembling lessened , and after a time he slept . It was n't sleep but a gaining of rest , because when he really slept he would not be easy to wake again . After a short time he awoke and they made love to each other . There was no surprise about it and no surprise about each other , they were exactly what they had expected of each other . When they had finished they lay back on the bed and looked at the darkness of the ceiling . " I know everything about you , " Caterina said , " except one thing . I do n't know your first name . " " Perhaps we should keep it that way . You know what they say here : Love , but make sure to keep a wall between you : " " No , I want to know it . I feel I am entitled to that . " " I do n't like my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it several different ways . " It does n't suit you . " " It 's German . It comes from Karl . I 've come to despise it . " They could hear the rain running down from the roof tiles and the filled gutters , splashing down into the shutters outside the windows and onto the cobblestones of the street . " We have no wall between us , " Caterina said . " Maybe that is bad . Maybe that will destroy us . " " Why do you bring that up ? " He said that he did n't know . He said that he had lost faith and  | was no longer sure . " They say something else you should know , Love as if one day you will hate . ' Maybe they 're right . " " Why are they so mean and hard ? " Caterina said . " Because life is mean and hard . That 's my trouble , do you see . I only learned that when I was thirty-four years old . The oldest child you will ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone walls of the house . The rain began to come hard against the window pane . The wind was changing , Tufa said , and that meant the rain would pass . " I think I 'm also entitled to hear the story of the fountain now , " Caterina said . She wanted to end this concern with themselves , it was too much for one day , but it did n't matter , because Tufa had surrendered himself to sleep at last . She lay beside him , fearful of moving but not able to sleep . " Tufa ? Carlo ? " She knew he would n't answer , but she wanted to talk to him . She had been watching his face and she found that looking at moved her . She found she wanted to touch it , but she was afraid to . " You 're going to make me be in love again , " she said . The idea frightened her , because falling in love is dangerous . She thought of the Germans ' coming . What was meaningless the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing then and were everything now . They could take her , they could take Tufa , they could end what had already begun . In the end , however , she slept and like Tufa surrendered herself so completely to sleep that she did n't hear the soft thin pounding of the bell or peoples ' steps on the cobblestones or the slamming of the doors , or even the shouts of those who were beginning to fill up the piazza down the hill below them , or the thumping of the carts going down the hill into the piazza.  | ROBERTO had left them , Malatesta and Tufa , in the Piazza of the People and had gone to the People 's Palace and to bed . He had slept for perhaps an hour or more , when Bombolini woke him . " God has come to me again , " he said . " I want you to hear the new message . " Roberto was reluctant to move or even to lie there and listen to the story . " Would you like some onions ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Roberto got up then because it frightened him to hear Bombolini beg him , and together they went downstairs . There was a pot of onions simmering in olive oil over the small fire the mayor had built .  | " God clearly is trying to tell me something and I am too stupid to understand it , " Bombolini said . " The answer is in here . I feel it in here and I ca n't get it out  --  like a rabbit in the back of a hole . " And he told this story about the famous family named Doria : They were famous sailors from Genoa , but at the time of the story they had very little money . One day the king announced he would honor them with a visit for dinner to their house . " Turn down the offer . Find some excuse , " the brothers of Andrea said . " We have no silverware , we have no decent plate , no dishes worthy of a king . We will be ashamed . " But Andrea told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbor and borrowed all of his gold and silverware , and as proof that he would return it he left his oldest son as a hostage . If the plates were not returned the rich man could do as he pleased with the boy , even kill him . The king arrived and he was impressed with the meal and with the service and with the gold and silver plates and platters and with the marvelous view of the sea and the harbor . " You 've done well for yourselves , " he said . " You know how to live in the royal way . " " Our house is small because as seamen we prefer to live lightly so that we can move swiftly , " Andrea said . " Sometimes , for example , when we are about to sail , we do n't bother with the plate . We simply throw it off the terrace and into the sea . " And he flung a solid-gold goblet over the side of the terrace and down into the sea far below . The king 's mouth was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or you can drop them like this . " He dropped a heavy silver tray into the sea . " I like to throw them myself . " He threw a gold fork over his head and off the terrace . " Like this ? " the king said . And he flung a gold plate . " Like that , yes . It 's very handy , " Andrea said , and he dropped a silver pitcher into the sea . Even for a king it is not an everyday occasion to cast a fortune into the sea . They threw the plates and they threw the bowls and the knives and the forks , and when there was nothing left to throw at all the king turned to the Dorias and said : " Great men . You are great men , capable of the great act . I salute you . "  | He made them dukes on the spot . They are dukes to this day . They have been rich from then on . * * * " It 's in there , Roberto , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's hiding in there . " " It was a high price to pay to impress the king , " Roberto said . " What happened to the boy ? " " What do you mean what happened to the boy ? " Bombolini said . " he went home to his father . " " But the treasure . All of the treasure was gone in the sea . " Bombolini looked at Roberto as if he had never really seen him before . " The gold and silver was in the fish nets they had stretched all along the bottom of the sea the day before . They only lost a silver cream pitcher . " " Ah , the fish nets . " If the answer was in the story it lay somewhere in the fish nets , Roberto realized . " Of course , the fish nets . You do n't think they would throw the gold off the terrace without fish nets down below ? " He realized one other thing . That although he spoke the language he would never understand the mind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish net down below , and the point of the story was not how to fool a king as much as what a clever way to use a fish net . " Do you see it now ? " Roberto had to admit that he did n't see it . " Come and eat and maybe it will come to you . " He ladled out the hot browned onions and he poured the bubbling olive oil over bread , and while he did that Roberto told him about Tufa and the Malatesta . " You know there 's only one bed in the house , do n't you ? " Bombolini said . Roberto shook his head . " One bed . Can you imagine it ? " he said . " A Malatesta copulating with a Tufa ? You do n't know what it means . A revolution , a new world entirely . A Tufa copulating with a Malatesta in the house of Malatesta . " " How do you know they are doing it ? " Roberto said .  | Once again Bombolini looked at him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're in the same bed , are n't they ? " It is an Italian belief that if two people are in the same bed they must be making love to one another , not from desire necessarily , but because man is weak and unable to resist the natural urge . There is no court in Italy that is prepared to believe otherwise . Roberto watched the mayor wiping the olive oil from his cheeks and chin and realized only then that he was crying , quietly but steadily , exactly as he had been eating . When the last of the bread and onions had been eaten Bombolini turned to Roberto . " Do n't let it alarm you , " Bombolini said . " But , Roberto , tell me this one thing . What am I going to do ? " " Something will turn up . You watch . " " Americans always say that , " Bombolini said . " Will you listen to a story from me ? " When Bombolini nodded Roberto told him a story he had learned from a soldier who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a man was hunting for bear and he came to the middle of a great open field and he found that his gun would n't work . There was no tree to climb , no rock to run behind , no cave to crawl into and all at once an enraged bear came out of some distant woods across the open field directly at the hunter . It was a very close call , Roberto said . " What do you mean , a close call . What did the hunter do ? " " He climbed a tree . " " But I thought you said there was no tree . " " That 's just the point . There had to be , there had to be . " Bombolini had listened with respectful silence , and when the story was over he shook his head and made a face . " That 's the difference between us , Roberto . You think there has to be an answer . But we know different . A thousand years has taught us differently . That 's just the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will learn that some day . " The mayor began to shed tears once more , very quiet and with no movement of his face , and Roberto felt he should turn away . " Like with your idea about hiding the wine , " Bombolini said , " It seemed like a good idea but it did n't work . "  | He said it as if it were an accusation and it angered Roberto , as if somehow America was responsible for the wine in the piazza . " Of course , if you had put it where I told you . . . " Roberto said . " What do you mean , where you told me ? " " In the place I told you about , " Roberto said . " It might not work but at least you might have tried . " Bombolini did not want to ask him . He was becoming used to the idea that there was nothing that could be done to save the wine . It was comforting to him to admit surrender , and he was n't willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , in a voice as thin as the sound of the bell . " In the Old Roman wine cellar . " Bombolini said nothing . He had an enormous urge to yawn . " Down below the terraces , " Roberto said . " At the foot of the mountain . The place with the two wine cellars . " " The two wine cellars , " the mayor said . Tut the wine in one of them and brick it over . " " Put bricks over the opening . " His voice remained as thin as before , but it was a little higher . " Yes . So it looks just like the wall . Seal it off , " Roberto said . " Instead of an opening you 'll have a false wall . " Bombolini said nothing for a long time  --  so long that Roberto grew impatient with him . " It 's all brick back there . You must remember it . " Bombolini nodded but the truth was that he had not been in the cave or seen the wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even look as if it belongs in there . The one at the far end . It looks like an afterthought , you know . " " Yes , " Bombolini said . " As if they built the first cellar and found they did n't have enough room and had to add a second one . " " Yes . " " So if you bricked it over it would all look like part of the wall . " " Yes . " He looked numb now , although his heart was racing and he was conscious of blood rushing through him , as numb as the old oxen , the eyes large and staring , the body stunned but not moving , waiting for the next blow of the sledge hammer .  | " They 'll find it out , " the mayor said . " I suppose so . " " They 'll see through it at once . " " It 's a chance , that 's all . " " They are n't stupid people . " " I suppose there are stupid Germans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They want the wine , " Bombolini said . " They 'll do anything to get it . " " You want it too , " Roberto said . " I thought you wanted to try anything to save it . " Bombolini had been looking at the wall , afraid that if he looked at Roberto his line of reasoning might break down . Now he turned and moved toward him . " I 'm sorry , " Roberto was saying . " I thought it was worth the " Worth the try , Roberto ? Worth it ? " He moved so swiftly toward Roberto that he struck a chair and knocked it over and did n't seem to notice it . " Christ , Roberto , " Bombolini said . " Christ above , Roberto , " he said , and then he did something that is hard to put on paper because it is hard to make sense of . He struck Roberto such a blow in the face that the American fell to his knees and stayed there for a moment before going the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . " We 'll build such a wall that God Himself wo n't be able to see it , " he said aloud . He came back to himself then from wherever he had been . There was blood on the stones and for a moment he made a gesture of stopping and helping Roberto , but he turned and started instead for the door . " I 'm sorry , Roberto , but there 's no time for you . " He ran . When he reached the piazza he kept running until he got to the campanile , and when the bell tower door would n't open he pulled on it with such fury that the old iron handle came off in his hands and he was able to work the latch . He felt for the bell cord in the darkness and when he felt the greasy hemp he began to pull on it as hard and as swiftly as he was able . There was the thin and muffled tone .  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their inspection tour down the Corso Cavour . Everyone wanted to say something to Bombolini , to touch him , to hit him on the back . A woman took him by the arm . " I want to tell you this , Italo . You are a great man , " she shouted at him , and she kissed him full on the lips while her husband stood there and smiled and approved . That is the way it was in the Piazza of the People , all of the way across it . The mayor did n't want to smile , he wanted to impress on the people the importance of the day and the work that lay ahead of them , but when they shouted at him and blessed him the smile would come and he could not get it to go away from his face . They stepped around the big wicker grape baskets the people had carried into the piazza and past the women with the large-throated water jugs that would receive bottles and over the buckets and tubs and laundry baskets that were spread over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pietrosanto , as head of the army directing traffic in the piazza , was shouting orders . " Get all of the people with the shoulder yokes and bring them to the fountain , " he was shouting . " Shoulder yokes , shoulder yokes , " the men shouted , and in every corner a push and a shove began as the people with the yokes began their fight to get to the fountain . " Will you ever get it organized ? " Bombolini shouted to Pietro . " I got it organized , " Pietro said . " I know what I 'm doing up here . " " It was hard to see it , the way it is hard for an outsider who sees the harvest here to realize that out of all this chaos was actually a kind of secret and complex order that only those involved in picking the grapes can understand and that in all the pushing and shouting and shoving there was a shape and a form . Already , for example , all the young men and the strong men had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time came to pick up the bottles and begin carrying them down the mountain to the Roman cellars they would be the first to go because they could do the most . " When you 're ready for me down there , " Pietrosanto shouted , " I 'll be ready up here . " By the time Bombolini and the men reached the Corso and  | started down it the young men were clapping their hands in time and shouting " Let 's go , let 's go , let 's go , let 's go . . . " and the sound followed them down through the street as if a mob were bellowing through a pipe at them . At the Fat Gate they stopped . " Now where the hell is Polenta ? " Bombolini said . " It 's no good without the priest . " They waited for him and before they left they saw him coming down from a side lane into the Corso , his silver cross bobbing up and down over the heads of the people around him as he came , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be blessed on this day , " Padre Polenta said . " There 's no time for blessing , " Bombolini said . " There is always time for God 's blessing . " When Bombolini saw all the men begin to nod he dropped the matter . The shouting from the piazza drove them on . " We could move the whole city today , " Vittorini said . " We could move the whole mountain , " one of them said . When they trotted around the sharp corner in the Corso just past Babbaluche 's house and shop , Bombolini for one brief moment felt a sensation of chill , the way it happens on an autumn day when a cloud passes over the sun and all at once it is cold . Bombolini said it was as if a cold hand slipped over his heart and squeezed it , very gently and coldly . But they ran on . There is going to be trouble here , Bombolini said to himself , but he did n't hear himself . They went through the Fat Gate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foot of the mountain . They were walking fast , and then they were running down . " Pietrosanto will be starting now , " one of them said . The sun came up then , all at once , and it touched the walls around the city and then the roof tiles , and it glittered off the red-and-blue sign on top of the Cooperative Wine Cellar so that the sign was like a sun itself . " You 're certain you know how to do it , Padre ? " Bombolini said . " It wo n't take long , I hope . " " It 's in here , right here , " the priest said . He tapped the book he held in his hand along with the cross . " All the rules of God . "  | After such a rain it should have been cool , but the wind had shifted and was coming from the south . The door to furnace of Africa that we thought had been closed for the year was open again . By afternoon the fresh snow on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be running with fresh water and the fountain in the piazza would be spurting ice-cold water . But down here the mud would harden and then cake , and by late afternoon the caking would explode into dust . " A very fine day for the grapes , " one of them said . Heat after rain is said to cause sugar to form and turn fat in the grapes . No one mentioned the other thing , that it would be a bad day for people . The sun already had a hot look to it , flat and hard and white , like a plate hung in the sky , and no cloud anywhere to soften it along the way . After that they went in silence until they reached the opening in the mountain that leads into the Big Room and the two cellars built into the back wall of the room . None of them would enter it then until the priest had gone in first . " Hurry up , Padre , please , " Bombolini said . " Run in there and sanctify the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Polenta said , and he opened the black book and licked a forefinger and started through from page one . " The index , Padre , " Babbaluche said . " Ca n't you study the index . Look under ' D ' for Devils : " The priest did n't look up . He went on the way he was going . The first men were already starting down the mountain with their loads of wine before he was halfway through the book . " Ca n't you make up a prayer , Padre ? " Vittorini said , in a gentle voice . " I think that God would like that , " someone said . They nodded . " Something new and fresh for a change , " Bombolini said . " Something from the heart , not from a book . " " Yes , " Bombolini said . " God would like that . If I were God I know that I would . " " There is a right way to cast out spirits and there is a wrong way , " Padre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and God goes by the book . " The first of the men had put down their wine on the sandy flat  | outside the entrance to the cellars and started back up the mountain when Polenta found what he was looking for . " Exorcise , " the priest said . He looked up at them . " Not under ' devil . ' Not under ' ghosts , ' not under ' spirits . ' Under ' exorcise . ' " Polenta waved his finger at him , and the mayor leaped forward to seize the book . " Do n't lose your place , Padre , in the name of God , " he said . It was n't easy even after that . The priest read to himself for a long time and then announced that he needed water . There was no water and they offered him wine , but since the book said water it must be water . It was fortunate that it had rained the night before and the drainage ditch alongside the cart track to the road was filled with muddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat and the cock feathers were limp with water and clogged with clay . Bombolini handed the hat to the priest . " Now go in there and start blessing , Padre , " he said . Polenta went inside the entrance and several of the braver men went with him , staying behind the cross and the aspergillum and the priest while he flayed and scourged whatever evil spirits were hiding in the darkness of the Big Room . When he started further in , back toward the two wine cellars built into the back wall and dug far into the mountain , even Bombolini lagged behind , and so the priest was all alone when he stepped down into the first of the cellars and fell head first into the water . When he came up again and shouted for help no one went to his aid at Jnce , because it was felt that the battle between evil and good must have been joined there and that good was losing to evil , as sometimes happens . Finally Bornbolini and Vittorini crossed the room and found the priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the dry sandy floor of the Big Room . The ice-cold hand had slipped over Bombolini 's heart once more and his heart , or perhaps his soul , which he felt was associated with his heart , was as cold as the priest 's skin . " It 's all over now , " one of them said . " There 's nothing left to be done . " The cellars were flooded with four feet of water . Men began to come into the Big Room , although no one would go to the cellars . Some of them had been afraid even to stand by the entrance , for  | fear that the spirits , chased out of the cave by the holy water and the cross , might somehow fly down into them . Five people at least now claim to be the one who first suggested what to do . " Get Longo , " someone said . " If anyone can do anything now it is Longo . " When you write a history and look back you see there are many points and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been for some one act . If Fabio had not gone to Montefalcone that evening , if Gambo 's bike had not been available because Gambo had been hit by a rock and Gambo had not shared a room with a woman like Gabriele and Fabio had not been pretty enough to please her , and if Tommaso Casamassima had not made his speech about brave men and good wine  --  Longo belongs to one of these moments . They seized his name and began to shout it in the Big Room , booming it off the rough stone walls , " Longo , Longo " ? a miracle in their midst , one more twig for people who were drowning . One of the youngest men ran out of the cellar and started up the mountain . He ran until his legs would not go any farther , and then he cried out Longo 's name to one of the men coming down . There was now a steady line of people coming down the mountain with their burdens of wine , and the man turned and called the message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it back to another , and in this way the message flew up the mountain from mouth to mouth , leaping up at fifty feet a step . By the time Bombolini and the priest came out of the cave and into the sun and looked up at the city , Luigi Longo , as puzzled as most of the people in Santa Vittoria , was already on the way down . Longo is an example of something that can happen to a man here . When he was young he had somehow managed to get away and go to Switzerland and become an apprentice electrician . But he came home one day for his father 's funeral , and a few months later there was a letter from Constanzia Casamassima telling him that she was carrying his child and that he had better come back and make her honest or her father and her brothers would go up there and make him something she would rather not describe . Longo came back , and then there was the grape harvest and the baby was born and he had inherited a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day Longo woke up to find that his visa had expired and he could n't go back to Switzerland and he was bound to the soil of Santa Vittoria as securely as were the roots of the vines he tended in a subdued rage . We were spoiled by Longo here . He never lost the dream of wires and when he was sober he was a genius with electrical things , a first-rate electrician with tenth-rate equipment . There was no piece of wiring that Longo had not at some time restored or re-created . The wiring here was our Lazarus , sickly and dying and dead , and to them Longo was our Christ , performing a miracle a week . He looked at the first of the two wine cellars , and he went into the water and walked along the walls , and in total silence he came outside and drew some pictures in the sand and then he stood up and brushed the hair out of his long , tired , ravaged face and said : " I can do this thing . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the things that Longo did or started . There was an old generator here which was kept in the cellar of Santa Maria of the Burning Oven and which had been left behind by a traveling circus when a juggler had attempted to kill a tightrope walker over the love of a twelve-yearold acrobat , a boy , which confused the people here , and everyone had cut everyone else and gone to the hospital or to jail , and we were left with a set of Indian clubs and the generator for the lights . He told them to get the pump from the water tower and to cut down all of the electric wires that ran from the foot of the mountain to the Fat Gate and to bring the wire to the Big Room and after that he ordered the two best bicycles in the city to be brought down the mountain with four or five of the best young riders . Bombolini went back outside of the cave , because he did n't understand what Longo was doing and it made him nervous not to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the flat sandy place and was piling up back across the flat part of the valley . " How 's it going ? " the men who were carrying the wine would shout to the mayor . " Fine . It 's going well . It 's going well . "  | They would smile then . They were happy and excited . They were doing something and had some work to do . Bombolini also made marks in the sand . There were 18 hours left in this day and there were 17 hours left in the day ahead . The total was 35 . He added them over and over again , as if by coming up with some new answer he could change the order of the hours . He looked very sad then . " What 's the matter ? " Vittorini asked him . " Nothing is the matter . Everything is good , " Bombolini said , but the anguish was there , in the numbers : 35 and o . The Germans would arrive in 35 hours . Not one bottle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they put up the plaques , next to the one for Bombolini and Tufa , alongside the eternal green flame that already bums in the piazza for Babbaluche the cobbler , there should be one for Longo . The things Luigi Longo did that morning are remembered here and will always be remembered here . By seven o'clock the pump had been pried loose from the base of the water tower and the generator had been cleaned and the old fire hose had been carried down the mountain as if it were an old tired python and the bicycles had been taken apart and readjusted so that , when they were pumped and their wheels , which were elevated from the ground , were turned , they caused the drive wheels on the generator to turn and power was created and a dim light began to appear in the bulbs , which grew brighter and  | brighter as the young men drove the bicycle wheels . Fabio was among the bike riders . " Now you have come back , " Bombolini said . " Only for today and tomorrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to humiliate myself when the bastards come . " " We 're going to do it , Fabio . We 're going to save the wine . " " Even if you lose your honor . " Bombolini was hurt by the boy 's bitterness . " You get on fire , Fabio . It 's no good . Fire in the heart only ends up causing smoke in the head . " Babbaluche , who was fashioning the leather belts that connected the generator to the bicycle wheels , had heard them . " It 's more peasant wisdom , " he said to Fabio . " Do n't listen to him . It 's more smooth words . What did my father say ? Beware of the man who makes cream with his mouth ; he winds up making butter with his nose . ' You watch him , Fabio . When the krauts come he 'll wind up with butter all over his nose . " Fabio was disgusted . He turned away from Bombolini , who disgusted him . " Where are the real Italians ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did no one answered . " That 's exactly what I plan to do . When they come I plan to have butter all over my nose , " Bombolini said . When the generator had built up a store of energy Longo connected it to the pump . At first , for the first few minutes at least , there was terror in the Big Room because nothing happened to the pump . The moving parts were heavy with old oil and stubborn like an old ox , but then Longo began to move the parts by hand and they began to move on their own after that , grudgingly , only as far as they had to go , the way a snail moves when it is prodded , but then to go a little more swiftly each moment and then to gurgle and cough and burble and finally to thump now and then and all at once to go thump , thump , thump , thump , and water began to gush from the mouth of the hose . They heard the cheer from the Big Room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roars went up the ancient air shafts out into the pastures above the cellars , and they could hear them in the town . When the old hose broke , which happened often , it was Longo  | who fixed that as well . He sent boys up onto the terraces and they came back with grape leaves and vines , and they tied them over the breaks in the tired old fabric of the hose , like crude bandages to stop the bleeding of a wound . Longo came out of the cave after that , and he sat down with Bombolini in the warm sun . " We 're going to do it , " Longo said . " The first cellar will be empty in an hour . " Bombolini rose and took Longo 's hand and he kissed him on both cheeks . " He says we 're going to do it , " he said to Vittorini . " Yes . I heard him say it . We 're going to do it . " Old Vines came out of the cave after that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Longo , " using the grape leaves . So the grapes will save the grapes . It is fitting . " " We 're going to do it , " Bombolini said . " Yes , we 're going to do it , " the cellar master said . Bombolini started back up the mountain then for Santa Vittoria , and he was conscious that never in his life had he ever felt happier than he felt right then .  | /-kUFA was like the others here . He had come awake with the sun , and in the end he could n't stay in bed with the sun up . He wanted to stay in the bed , next to this woman , but he heard the sounds in the piazza and the oxen in the lanes and he felt that he must get out of the bed . Before he did he was conscious that she was awake also , lying next to him , looking at him . " You should go back to sleep , " she said . " It 's very important for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . " It caused him to laugh and that offended her . One of them was always laughing at something the other had not meant to be funny . " Do you really think I 'd get my strength back lying here next to you all day ? "  | " Oh , that . Oh , I see . Soldier talk . It was uncalled for . " " Why ? You have no shame . You told me . " She smiled at him then . " It 's true . I was born outside shame . It used to worry my teachers at school . They always felt I was going to get in some terrible trouble . " " And did you ? " " Of course not . Since I had no shame I was n't attracted to the kind of people who get you into trouble . " " Which is why you are here in bed with me . " " I do n't know why I 'm here in this bed with you . Except that I want to be . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you doing ? " Tufa said . " I 'm the peasant here . I 'm the one who gets up . " " I 'm going to get us something to eat , " Caterina said . " I 'm not hungry for food right now . " " You 're the one with no shame . " " I 'm the one who is starved , " Tufa said . He watched her come back across the room toward him . She had no clothes on and there was no consciousness of herself , and he knew that no other woman in Santa Vittoria would ever be able to walk that way or do such a thing . " You 're so honest , " Caterina said . " I could never say a thing that way . I have n't learned to talk that way yet . " He reached up and brought her to the bed . " No , I see it , " Tufa said . " It 's true . You have no shame . " When they were through he did sleep again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds of the city and the morning . She sat in the bed and looked at his uniform , black , stained , dirty , torn . It would have to be done away with before the Germans came . The sight of the uniform saddened her , because it told by itself the ordeal Tufa must have endured . Very quietly then she got out of the bed and went into a back room and came out with a suitcase full of clothes that had once belonged to her husband . He had left them there in the event that one day he might be forced to run . They were good clothes for Tufa , outdoor clothes , estate clothes , hunting clothes . She went back into the room and looked down on Tufa and at that moment knew real fear . Through Tufa she had invested in  | life again , and to the degree you invest , to that degree are you in danger of losing your investment . There was no fear for herself  --  not that she was brave but because she was confident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take advantage of her . Men were afraid of her kind of beauty . Tufa was beautiful , also , but his kind of beauty was different . Because he was a challenge to other men , she knew that he was a type that men were driven to destroy . She began to clean up the room , because she knew he would like that , and even to sweep and she was thankful that he was n't awake to see her handle the twig broom . When he finally did awake again he said he was hungry , truly hungry , not for her but for bread dripping with olive oil , for some good black olives and for an egg . Caterina put down the broom and went to the door . " I am going to get you an egg if I have to sell myself to do it , " Caterina said . She was conscious that he did n't approve of her joke . " I 'm going to go with you , " Tufa said . He began to get out of bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Are n't you going to turn around ? " he said . " If you wish . " " It 's what the women here do . When the man gets up they turn around . " " I did n't know , " Caterina said . " I do n't see anything wrong with it , " Tufa said . " I 'll make it a point to turn around , " Caterina told him . But she had seen him and he was the way she expected . Had he been born rich he would have to be described as beautiful , the kind of model a sculptor would use . But time had done things to Tufa . The body now showed the effects of life on beauty , the way life attempts to destroy it and bring it down to its own level . The body was too hard in places and too damaged . The arms were too heavy , too veined and muscled from too much hard work , the wrists were thick , the texture of the skin was rough from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything about the body was bone and sinew , and hard . But still the beauty was there , beneath it , especially in Tufa 's face and eyes . " If you will look by the bed you will see some clothes , " she told  | him . " They belonged to my husband . I did n't think you would mind . " " Mind ? No , why should I mind ? " He began to pick up the clothes . " He had good taste , " Tufa said . " He had money . " " You can turn around now , " he said . He was wearing brown corduroy pants with leather patches on the inside of the knees and a white linen shirt that opened at the neck and a large brown leather belt and a soft dark hat . He was very handsome and he knew it . " They 'll think I 'm a landowner , " Tufa said . " It 's better than knowing you 're a Fascist officer . Come . You must be starving . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the hill that goes into the Piazza of the People they were able to see the piazza itself , and Tufa stopped in amazement . " What in the name of God are they doing down there ? " he said . " Something to do with the wine we saw last night , " Caterina told him . She wanted to take the lane that cuts down and around the back side of the piazza so they would be alone and quiet , but Tufa would n't allow her . When they came down into the piazza itself he stopped and watched them . " Look at the way they 're loading those carts , " he said to her . " They should take down the sides and then put the wine in and put the sides up again . They could go twice as fast . And look at this one over by the front of the church . " " Come , " Caterina said . " It 's not our concern . " She looked at him and made him take his eyes away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little time , you know ? " Oh , you 're right , " Tufa said . " It 's a habit . You see them doing it wrong and you want them to do it right . " He took her by the hand , in the daylight , something that is n't done here , and they started around the outer edge of the piazza . Not many noticed them . It was hot in the piazza then and loud , and the ox manure and mule droppings steamed on the cobblestones and there was the smell of people and wine from broken bottles and the sound of them all mingled into a thick soup .  | " I can smell this town miles away , " Tufa said . " Every town has its own smell . " " I do n't know if I like it or not , " Caterina said . " I used to hate coming back here . " " I like it . " " Then I think I 'll try to like it , " Caterina said . " I ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were in the part of the piazza where the oxen had been put , and the smell was very strong then and they pushed their way in and out between the animals . " Then you 'll have to fall in love with an ox first , " Tuf a said . " That 's the first step . " " No it is n't , " Caterina said ; but he did n't understand her . They went around the far side to one of the lanes that leads out of the piazza down into one part of Old Town to where the dung heaps are and the chickens are and where they might be able to get an egg . Before going down it , Tufa stopped to study the scene once more . " Whoever is running this is an idiot , " Tufa said and turned away from it , and so he failed to see Bombolini with several of the other leaders come up into the Piazza of the People , although they saw Tufa . " Look at them , " the priest said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one bed in that house . " " Who would have believed it ? " Bombolini said . " It 's hard to believe your own eyes . A Tufa with a Malatesta in one bed . That 's democracy for you . " For the past several hours Bombolini had refused to believe the evidence of his eyes . He had come all the way up the mountain lying to himself . The traffic in the Corso Cavour had by then backed up so far and so deeply that the river of wine had become a trickle . It was because of the turn in the road and because the men were becoming exhausted from the loads they carried and the trips back up the mountain . The ox carts locked wheels in the turn and the traffic going down had to stop entirely to allow the traffic to come back up . " It 's all going wrong , " Pietrosanto said . " I do n't know what 's happening , but it 's all going wrong . "  | " It will work its way out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold hand on his heart again , he believed it at the moment . The Italians have made an art out of their ability to deceive themselves , a German once wrote about us . " And why not ? " Babbaluche would say . " It 's the only thing that keeps the poor bastards going . " " It 's the thing that destroys us , " Fabio once said . " We have to face the truth . " " And do you have a gun to put to your head ? " the cobbler said . There is no way of telling how long the mayor would have gone on this way if Pietrosanto had not seen Tufa pass through the piazza . " I 'm going to ask Tufa , " he said . " We do n't need people to come in from the outside and tell us how to run our affairs , " Bombolini said . He was openly hurt . " Outside ? " Pietrosanto shouted . " Outside ? Tufa 's one of us . Tufa 's a Frog . Tufa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " He did n't say the rest , but began running for the back lane , pushing and shoving people as he went . Caterina and Tufa were already far down when Pietrosanto reached the head of the lane but they did n't stop or turn around . " No one looked at us in the piazza , " Caterina said . " I thought they liked you here . " " They saw . Under the veils , behind the oxen . They do n't know what to say to us . They do n't know how to speak to us . They do n't know whether to call me signor or don because I 'm sleeping with the Malatesta . " " Do you think they know about last night ? " Tuf a looked at her first with astonishment and then with real humor , and he began to laugh as he had n't laughed for a long time " Do they know ? My God , Caterina . " It was the first time he had used her name . " They know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible . " Tufa was serious then . " No , no , they think I 'm lucky . " Pietrosanto seized him by the shoulder . His face was as red as a pot and he was taking big breaths , because Pietro is not young . " I saw you looking in the piazza . Do you know something ? You know something to do ? "  | Pietro put his hands on his knees and bent over to get his breath and stop his heart from pounding , and Tufa took a long time in answering . " Yes , I have a plan . " Pietrosanto stood up then . " I knew he would have a plan , " he shouted at Caterina . " He 's smart , do you understand ? He has a head . A head . A head . " Pietrosanto is n't one to hold back when he is excited . He hit himself on the head with the heel of his hand so hard that if he had done it to someone else it would have begun a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have hit the Malatesta if Tufa had n't blocked his hand . " It 's very complicated , " Tufa said . " Will it save the wine ? " " If it works it will save the wine . " Pietrosanto took off his hat , the one with the tall hawk 's feather that marked him as the leader of the army of the Free State of Santa Vittoria , and put it on Tufa 's head , and he took off his red arm band , which read Commander in Chief , and pinned it around Tufa 's arm . Tufa looked at Caterina . " What can I say ? " Caterina said . " You look good in the hat . " " If it was anything else but the wine , do you understand ? " Tufa said . " But it 's the wine . It 's blood here , you know , and it 's my blood as well as theirs . " " I 'll go and get you the egg , " Caterina said , and started down the lane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the People . Tufa 's name ran ahead of him the way they say it happens in Rome when the Pope passes . Tufa . . . Tufa . . . Tufa 's here . . . Tufa 's back . . . Tufa ... Tufa . . . Tufa 's in charge . . . It 's going to be all right , Tufa 's back . When they reached the piazza , although no one had been able to move before , a path was somehow opened in front of them . Give this credit to Bombolini . He was able to see the piazza as it was , the mess that had been created in the city . The Master would have approved of him . He came forward to meet Tufa . And give credit to Tufa . He could have seized command then with the approval of the people , but he deferred to the mayor , whom he knew only as a clown .  | " Will you ask the people to clear the piazza ? " Tufa said . " Tell them to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to eat and to rest and to wait . " At first it appeared to be a failure , but then a few people got into the right lanes and started down them and as they left the jam began to lessen and soon the lanes going up and down from the piazza were filled to the walls with people and animals and carts . While they waited they heard good news . The water pump had lowered the level so that it revealed the top of the ancient drain , and a boy named Rana , which means frog ( because he is shaped like a frog ) was sent swimming down the darkness of the pipe with a grappling hook . He found a tree in the drain which must have been there hundreds of years , since there are no trees here anymore , not down in the valley . They pulled it out and the water began to rush down the length of the drain as if a giant toilet had been flushed . " God has a purpose . God knows . He sent us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Everyone nodded . There had never been any other use for Rana during all that time except to make jokes of him . While Rana had been swimming in the drain they had found the old ventilation shafts , and cleaned them of the bones of sheep who had fallen in , and all of the things that had blown in over the centuries , so that the hot African wind which was burning on the side of the mountain began to rush down into the cellars and through the Big Room , and Old Vines could say that they would be ready to lay the wine within an hour . Tufa 's second order was to take down the wall of the Cooperative Wine Cellar that faced the Fat Wall and the little opening through it that we call the Thin Gate . Some of the men were not sure about the next move . " Are you sure you want to do this , Tufa ? " Bombolini asked . Tufa nodded that he did . " Take down the wall , " the mayor ordered . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chipped at the bricks and stones with mattocks and hammers and iron bars , and they were delicate because they did n't like to break down something which had been built with so much effort and cost . But  | when the first bricks came out they began to throw themselves into the work , because there is always something exciting about destroying something and about tearing something apart . " The Corso is a pipe , you see ? " Tufa said . " As with any pipe , it can take so much water and no more , no matter what the pressure behind it . " " I see . " " You thought you could push it through by desire , because you wanted it . But there are laws  --  laws of nature . " " I see . " " Now we have to find a stream that can handle a larger flow . " " I see . " " Call out the people now . Leave the carts and leave the animals and bring the people down . " The wall was down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen inside , naked , exposed , looking out of place , like a woman caught with no clothes on in a place she has no right to be . " Ring the bell , " Tufa said . They looked at one another . " The bell does n't play so well . " One of them said to Tufa . " Something happened to the bell . " " It 's a very complicated story , " Bombolini said . They rang the bell , what there was of it to ring , and they sent boys running through the streets and lanes , and the people came out of their houses and gathered first in the Piazza of the People and then in a long file down the Corso Cavour right to the door and the broken wall of the Cooperative Wine Cellar . Some of them had managed to sleep for a few minutes and to eat , and they rubbed the sleep out of their eyes and the bread from their beards and lips . As they came down , then , Tufa and Pietrosanto and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them beginning at the open wall and running down across the open area where the grapes are pressed at harvest and down to the Thin Gate and through the wall and then down the steep track that the goats take down the mountain . " It 's going to take courage , " Tufa said to the women . " It 's going to take all your guts . "  | " We have guts , " a woman answered him . " When it comes to the wine we have guts , " another said . " I 'm going to ask more of you than I ask of soldiers , " Tufa told them . " I would hope so , " someone said . There is no respect for soldiers up here . Down they came then , filing down the Corso from the Piazza of the People , the true army of Santa Vittoria in the service of the wine . " Some of these are babies , " Tufa said . " When it comes to all-out war , " Vittorini said , " you use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh . " I 'm supposed to say those things , " he said . They mixed the old with the young , and the strong with the weak , so they could spell each other and make up for each other 's weaknesses . If people were too old or sickly Tufa would take them out of the line . " A chain is only as strong as its weakest link , " Bombolini would tell them , but they would curse him , to his face anyway . When Caterina came down the line Tufa stopped her . " Let me see your hands . " She held out her hands . They are so long and beautiful . He sent her back up the mountain to get gloves . When the last of the people had passed , Tufa ran down the line to make a last inspection . The line now ran from the back of the wine cellar to the wall and through it , and down the mountain to the entrance to the Roman cellar . Tufa came back up , placing the people where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place that was steep the taller people were positioned since they could reach up farther and lean down lower . The older people were put on the flat places , where the strain would be the least . At a few minutes after one o'clock on Tuesday afternoon Carlo Tufa was able to stand on the floor of the valley , one hundred feet from the entrance to the ancient wine cellar , and look back up the mountain , over the terraces , all the way to the city wall and to the Thin Gate , and even a few yards inside it , and see one continuous line of people . And he was able to know that the line continued all of the way beyond that into the heart of the cellar . He ran across the flat sandy stretch in front of the opening .  | " Are you ready in there ? " The men inside shouted back that they were hot to go . He ran outside then and back away from the base of the terraces so that Bombolini would be sure to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm . " Start them going , " he shouted . " Let them go . Pass them on , " he called out , even though he could n't be heard . But you could hear the people on the mountain then , shouting and cheering when they saw the sign , very loud in the valley and perhaps all the way to the river and over it in Scarafaggio . " Pass them on , pass them on , " the people began to shout , and the word flew up the mountain , it shot from mouth to mouth , and it was the start of the rhythm . The bottles began to flow then , hand to hand , a stream of bottles at first , out of the cellar , down to the gate , through the wall and then down the mountain , a stream at first until they found the rhythm of the flow and then it was a river , a river of wine running down the mountain .  | rjLHE SHOUTING stopped soon enough , because the day was hot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that three teams of men were finally needed to put down the wine . It is n't easy to describe how they lay the wine here . It is a simple-looking job , but outsiders never learn to do it well . It is something you grow up knowing how to do , the same as spooning soup into your mouth . No one remembers learning how to use a spoon , it is something that is learned and not taught . It was the same with the wine . The first row of bottles is laid on the ground , and then long strips of wood , just strong enough to support a second row of bottles , are laid on top of the bottom row . The second row is placed in the opposite direction , one row of corks , one row of butts , and this goes on , tier after tier , eighteen and even twenty  | tiers high . All of the while long thin strips of wood are worked clown through the rows of bottles , to the left of the neck of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neck of the bottle below , so that the bottles pull and push against each other and in the end provide the very force that holds them all together . It is very simple and very strong , and it can be put up or taken down as fast as men can put down bottles . At the beginning the wine-layers were gay also , shouting to each other to move it , move it , slapping the bottles from hand to hand , the rows rising and going back into the dimness of the deep cellar to where Longo 's pale lights could barely reach , but they soon ceased . As the wine kept coming they began to feel that they were running just ahead of a flood that in the end would drown them . Some of the men who worked in the cellar that day and night have never put down another bottle of wine , because the memory of it was so painful to them . In the first hours the enemy was the sun , which sat on the people 's backs as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but later it became the mountain itself . To keep from falling off it , the people were forced to brace themselves with one leg and step up the steep flank with the other , and more than any other part of the body it was the legs that began to tire and then to sting with fatigue and finally to cramp and knot . Tufa worked out a good plan . At a blast from the horn of Capoferro , every ten minutes , the people passed one more bottle and then stood up and massaged their legs and moved up the mountain to the spot above them . This gave the people a sense of going somewhere and it changed their positions and different muscles were put into use . After that , the problem was water ; and there was a second plan . At two blasts from the horn the wine passers put down the bottles and walked across the terraces to the concrete spillways that run down through the terraces and waited for the water to come . They got five seconds , and the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of the people put their faces in the spillway and caught what their mouths would hold and some caught water in shirts and hats and broken bottles and some climbed into the spillway itself and let the water run over them .  | After the second hour the bottles began to break . There were tired hands and sweaty hands , and the bottles would slip or swing against a rock and there would be the sound of breaking glass and a groan from someone on the line and then the smell of wine , good and sweet at first , but then sticky and sour as the sun reached it . Then there was blood . Many of the people had no shoes , and although their feet are as tough as ox leather , glass will finally cut through leather , and blood began to run with the wine and the whole length of the line to glitter with glass . In the late afternoon , when the sun was not so direct and when a cooler breeze began to slip up from the shadows in the valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true rhythm ; they gave into the bottles then , not seeing but only feeling them , swinging to the left and right , slapping the bottles from hand to hand , so that at times it sounded like a regiment of soldiers marching on the mountain . When the boys came down from the mountain where Tufa had sent them to cut pine branches to use for torches in the coming night he had another plan for them . He sent them into the line because they were fresh and still strong , and the people they replaced were allowed to get out and to crawl under the thick green shade of the grapevines and to rest and even sleep there for a little while . It was only a taste of rest , but it was enough to keep them going . The men were mixed with the women and there was something personal in the passing of the bottles , in the rhythm of it , in the swaying of the bodies , in the smell of each other and in the touching of their hands . Fabio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had hardly ever noticed before , and as they worked he began to appreciate a kind of stubborn beauty about her in the calm , passive set of her face and the smooth solid strength of her arms and the sureness of her touch and the way her solid full breasts rose and fell with each passing of the wine . Up above him in the line , he could see Angela working and it did n't bother him . She was a girl and this was a woman . " What are you looking at ? " the woman finally said to him . " You , " he said . It was the kind of thing that a week before  | would have caused him to turn scarlet and sent him running down the mountain . " Well , keep your eyes and your hands where they belong , " the woman said . " I will make an effort , but it will be hard , " Fabio said , and he smiled at her . Fabio , he told himself , you are becoming a goat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Caterina , and he decided that when the chance offered itself , he would work next to her . She was surrounded by women . She was the only one who wore gloves and in spite of the rough clothes she wore , ones designed for hunting or riding , it was easy to see that the Malatesta stood out from all the other women . The other women were black with sweat , but Caterina did n't sweat , there was only dampness on her brow and beads of wetness on her upper lip . " Even when they work the rich do n't sweat like the poor , " a woman said and it was true . From time to time Tufa came down the line to encourage the people on it and to change positions and to keep the bottles flowing , and when he did he took her place for a few minutes and allowed her to crawl under the vines . " Why do n't you sweat ? " he said to her . " It would be good for you . " " Malatestas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have forgotten how . They gave it up a long time ago . " " The dream of every Italian is some day not to sweat , " someone said . " And who will grow the grapes ? " " We 'll hire people to do that , " the cobbler told them . " We 'll hire Germans to do it . They like to work , " Babbaluche had said . One time when he had to go on , Tufa found Caterina asleep under a vine . He kissed her then , in front of others . " You have to get up , " he said . " But I am proud of you . " Later , Tufa realized that it was the first compliment he had ever given to a woman , because the men do n't learn to do that here . The sun at the time had been partly hidden by the tall mountain to the northwest of here and then swiftly , in a matter of moments , it went behind them completely and the mountainside and then the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then all along  | the line , mixed with the slap , slap , slap , slap of the glass against flesh , because at once it was cooler and also because many had promised themselves that if they could last until the sun went down they could make it through the evening and perhaps the night . * * * In the beginning of the night it was better . The cool winds had come and after that the fog . It clung to the dew on the grape leaves , and it moistened the ground and cooled the rocks , and it softened the skin that the sun and the wind of the day had dried and cracked . But the fog got thicker and there was new trouble on the line . When someone fell out it was hard for the replacement to find where the chain had been broken . " Here . . . Over here . . . Down . . . here . . . " the people would call , but at night and in the fog voices are strange and distances are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stones , and the bottles began to break again . At ten o'clock Tufa made a mistake . There had been no food , and a tiredness was beginning to settle on the line like some disease that paralyzes the muscles so there is only numbness left . To bolster the spirits he decided to allow every other person on the line to open the bottle he was passing and to share it with the person next in line . Because they were so starved , the wine made many of the people drunk , and the bottles began to break even worse than before . The night gave us protection from the eyes on the road and although the idea of morning was desired by the people it frightened them as well . But what frightened the people most of all was the knowledge that as hard as they had gone  --  and each hour they were going slower and slower  --  the Cooperative Wine Cellar on the mountain was still more than half full . Some time after ten that night , when the wine was moving badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of light . The pine boughs that had been cut that night were bound with wire and dipped into barrels of ox fat and lengths of rope were dipped in the same barrels and they were lit and passed down the mountain , one every fifty feet or so . It was dangerous . Beneath the fog the light of the flaming torches was magnified  | and the line glowed like some flaming arrow pointing down from the city to the ancient cellar below . It was dangerous , but it gave the people heart again . The people here are afraid of the night . Many of the men were afraid to step off the line and go into the vineyards to relieve themselves , and the women also worked in fear and pain both . The lights gave them courage . And it was these lights which drew Roberto down to the winepassing line . He had recovered from the blow and gone to bed , and when he awoke he went out of the Palace of the People and , not finding Bombolini , took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had thought the city was asleep until he saw the lights . He went down the Corso to witness what his words had begun . " What happened to you ? " Bombolini said . " You know what happened to me , " Roberto said . " Oh , yes , " the mayor said . It seemed to have taken place weeks before . " It was excitement . I know you understand . A blow of admiration . A blow of love . I am Sicilian , you understand . " " Being Sicilian must be a very strange thing , " Roberto said . " It provides an excuse for everything . " He watched the wine going down the mountain and he knew what was taking place , and then he went back up to the Cooperative Wine Cellar . He could see that almost half or perhaps even more than half of the wine was gone by then and he could also see that the people on the line were working by instinct , at the level of the lowest animals , like blind mules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are almost done , " Roberto said . " The people ca n't go on much longer . " " What do you mean , done ? There 's still half of the wine to go , " the mayor said . " But you would n't take it all . You have to leave some of it for them . " " We do n't leave a drop for the bastards , " a man shouted to Roberto from the line . " Do n't give away our wine , friend . " He felt guilty not helping , and although his leg pained him to work he took a place in line from a woman and was pleased to find that he could do the work and that he was near Caterina Malatesta and Angela Bombolini , although he knew he should n't  | think of such things . The work helped , but it bothered him , because he knew they were wrong about the wine . While he passed the bottles he remembered something from his youth and he knew he was right and that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they could understand . It was the Rabbit Garden that since has become famous in Santa Vittoria . When Roberto was a boy his father put in a large vegetable garden in the back of the house , because no Italian could stand the sight of soil going unused . Roberto was ashamed of it , filled with broccoli and other goomba foods . At night the rabbits came from the woods along a parkway and stole from the garden . The first year the garden was a failure , until some people told his father what the Americans did . They made their garden and they fenced it in , and then they made a second garden , smaller , with a low fence around it , for the rabbits . The rabbits came and ate the rabbit garden and they never touched the main garden again . " That 's America for you , " his father would say , and he would tap his head . In Italy , he would say , they would put boys in the garden all night if they had to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Signora , " Roberto said . " You have to take your place again . " She was disgusted with him . " You Americans , you have no guts , " she said . " You have forgotten how to work . " He went to Bombolini and he told his story , and Bombolini knew at once that it was true , that Santa Vittoria , if the Germans were n't to tear it apart brick by brick and stone by stone , needed a Rabbit Garden of its own . The only question was how large the garden should be . The mayor told it to Tufa , and Tufa was impressed , and Pietrosanto was made to understand , and so they stopped the flow of wine and allowed the people to rest , and by the light of the pine torches they held a meeting of the Grand Council . The council members looked into the wine cellar , and some of them walked around the bottles and tried to count them in their heads , and they came back outside with long faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the older men shouted . " Ten thousand . It 's enough , " another said . " Not a drop more . It 's all that we can afford . " Everyone knew the number was wrong , but none of them wanted to be the one to give the wine away ; it goes against everything in the blood . Pietro Pietrosanto is tougher than the rest and a realist , and it was Pietro who began the bidding again . " One hundred thousand bottles , " Pietro called out . One older man clapped his hand over his heart as if a knife had been put in it . " Jesus , Mary and Joseph , " he said , and he made the sign of the cross . For a time after that , no one dared to talk , because although there was not much time shocks such as these need time to be absorbed . Tufa and Roberto knew that a hundred thousand bottles were not enough , but it was Babbaluche who let them know it in the manner they could understand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigs and he ended by saying things that in Italy it is forbidden to put on paper , even in one 's own home , and in the end he named a proper figure : 500,000 bottles . He was correct and at the same time he was wrong . No bearer of the blood of the men who cut the terraces an inch at a time out of the stony sides of the mountain , no sons of those whose sweat watered the vines that had first been planted here a thousand years before , was capable of giving away 500,000 bottles of wine , even if it was the only correct thing to do . There is a limit to how far men will go even to save themselves . But the figure had the virtue of making the figure that was finally decided upon seem believable . After more minutes of bidding and debate , during which men wept and threatened to put themselves to death first , it was agreed to plant the Rabbit Garden with 300,000 bottles of wine . It is possible that at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have led to rebellion , but the people were then too tired to rebel , and the truth , which was not admitted for a long time afterward , was that to many it meant 300,000 fewer bottles to carry down the mountain . It gave the people on the line a second or third or last source of energy , the way it must be with a  | runner when he finally sees the tape ahead of him . There was at last a goal in sight and it was one that could be reached . At a little after four o'clock in the morning , when the sun had warned of its coming by making the torches useless , Tufa stepped in front of the man who had just bent once more and picked a bottle off the floor of the Cooperative cellar and he took it out of his hands . " This is enough , " Tufa said . " You can rest . This is the end . This is the last bottle . " The last bottle . They started it down the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't drop it , " they said , " this is the last . " People expected it to look different from all the rest , but it was the same , and it was hard to believe that one more would not be coming after it . They passed it along the way women pass around the newborn child or as if they were passing the Holy Eucharist , the Body and Blood of Christ , down the mountain , which in a manner they were , since this was the wine of God and the body and blood of Santa Vittoria . It was strange when the bottle had gone past . There was no sense of joy , but only one of emptiness . " What do we do now ? " a woman asked Tufa . " We go home to our beds , " he said to her . " But it 's time to get up . " " We go home to our beds . " They began to leave the line , the young helping the old , many so bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the Corso Cavour and off into the lanes and were lost in the corners and dark pockets of fog in the piazzas . It was agreed that the city should sleep until four o'clock in the afternoon , and then some of them should go down onto the terraces so that the Germans would not be suspicious and some should be in the piazzas and the streets . Tufa waited for Caterina to come up the line because he was too tired to go down after her . " This is the man who saved Santa Vittoria , " Bornbolini said to the Malatesta . Tuf a does n't like this kind of thing . " We are n't saved yet , " Tuf a said , " and if we are , the people saved the people . "  | " We know , " Bombolini said . " Everyone knows . " " Oh Christ , he can be a bore , " Tufa said . " And Christ , he can be true , " Caterina said . " Do n't use language like that , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cellar and rested , because they were too tired to climb up through the city without rest . She slept again , but he woke her . " Let 's go , " he said . " They 'll be here in twelve hours . " " And what if they come sooner ? " " They wo n't come sooner , " Tufa said . " If they 're supposed to come at five o'clock , they 'll come at five o'clock . " Everyone had gone by then , except the men who could n't be seen who were still laying wine in the Roman cellar and the men who were preparing the mortar and the brick to build the false wall . The street ahead of them was empty and the street behind , and when they went through the Piazza of the People it was empty as well If it is possible to hear a city sleep , Santa Vittoria slept . Caterina slept when she reached the bed . She had taken off her gloves , and he could see the soreness and the blisters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had found , a small one , a jewel of an egg , still stained by the dung heap in which she had found it . He broke the shell and drank the egg and put his head back on the bed . He had no idea whether he had slept or not when there was a shout at the door and he tried to get up and could not and then someone was beside him . " Tufa ? " He shook him . " Tufa , you got to get up . You hear me ? " Tufa nodded . " Something terrible has happened on the mountain . " Caterina did n't hear him get up and go .  | THE EXPEnrrroNARY force to Santa Vittoria . They were ready to go by ten o'clock that morning . They could have left and been in Santa Vittoria before noon , but they remained in the street that leads into the Piazza Frossimbone and waited for later in the afternoon . They wanted to move while it was still light , but late enough in the day so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the night . There was the motorcycle and behind it the small truck , and behind the truck the 2o-millimeter dual-purpose gun . They were dressed not for war , but as if they were going on parade . " If I had flowers I would put flowers in your buttonholes , is that understood ? " Captain von Prum had told them that morning . They had all nodded .  | They were restless . They wandered from the convoy out into the piazza and back into the shadows and out into the sun again , and as they waited they began to talk with the informality that boredorn can induce . From the piazza it was possible to see from Montefalcone across the river to where several villages and towns , much like Santa Vittoria were hanging far up on the sides of their mountain . " Why did they build them up there , sir ? " Sergeant Traub asked the captain . " People like us , " von Prum said . The sergeant did n't know whether to laugh at that or not . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admire those terraces , sir , " Traub said . " It must have taken work . " " Yes , hundreds of years work , " von Prum said . " Back-breaking work . " " I did n't know the wops had it in them , " the sergeant said . At a glance from the captain he changed that . " The Italians , " he said . " That 's better , Sergeant . " Because of that , Traub decided to bring up one thing which had been troubling him and which he might have kept to himself . " Sometimes it seems like a shame to take their wine , " Traub said . The captain looked at him and so he was forced to go on . " They work so hard for it , I mean . It 's what Schnabel. was saying , sir . He worked in the vineyards . A bottle of sweat for every bottle of wine . ' " " And then we come and take it . " " Yes , sir . " " And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are engaged in a war , and wars are n't pretty things to be engaged in : . " " No , sir . " " What we do we do to aid the state , the Fatherland . Whatever aids the state is good . " " Yes , sir . " " And now let me tell something a very wise German once wrote , Sergeant . To put your mind at rest . " The others had come around them , which pleased the captain .  | He wanted to give a lecture at this time , but without making it seem to be one . " The essence of life is a taking over . ' Do you understand that ? " Not only Traub , but the others too nodded . He repeated the words . " We do n't invent this fact . This is life itself . " He paused to allow them to think about his words . " The people who are rising in the world take over . The ones who are sinking are taken over . " " The Germans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the natural order of things . Nothing can alter it . The strong take ; the weak surrender . Do you think that is wrong ? " None of them was sure how to answer . " It is n't right or wrong . It is nothing . It is the way of life . The fact of life . The truth of all life . " He was through and knew that it was a good time to get away from the soldiers and let them accept the truth themselves . " Let 's get going and take over then , " Heinsick said . " The orders say five o'clock , " Sergeant Traub said . " If it says five o'clock it means five o'clock , and we will be there at five o'clock . " " Do you believe that ? " Heinsick said . " What he said ? " " Yes , I believe that . There are those who are born to be on top and those who are born to be on the bottom . Like officers and soldiers . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " " Yes , it 's true , " Heinsick said . " But then you 're superior to most wops . " " Yes , that 's true . " * * * They met him in the Piazza of the People  --  Bombolini , Pietrosanto , Fabio and Roberto  --  and started at once down the Corso Cavour . " It ca n't be described to you . You have to see it . All at once , " Bombolini said . Down through the Fat Gate , down the track that goes through the terraces . The sun was well up then . Fog still clung to clumps  | of grape leaves and tried to hold on to the vines , but they were only shreds of fog , the sun had burned the rest away . " Do n't turn back , " Bombolini said . " I want you to see it all at once . " On the sandy fiat before the entrance to the Big Room the bricks had already been brought down and were stacked on the sand . Some men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group was beginning to mix the cement and lime and sand and water that would be used to seal the bricks together . " They might as well stop that now , " Bombolini said , but the men did n't hear him . " It 's not going to do any good . It 's all a waste now . " They did n't hear him . In the morning Bombolini seemed to have grown smaller than he had been in the night . He touched Tufa on the arm . " Go ahead . Look . You might as well see it now . " Tufa was unable at first to see what was causing the concern , and when he did see it he felt that it might only be some trick that the early morning sun was playing or that his own eyes were playing on him even though it was clear to him that the others had seen what he saw . From the Thin Gate down the goat path , down through the terraces and directly into the mouth of the cellar ran , unbroken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brilliant purple stain . " The wine , " he said . " Yes , the wine , " someone answered him . And making the purple even more brilliant to the eye , dazzling in truth , was the glitter of the sun on the pieces of glass from a thousand broken bottles . " If God Himself were making a sign to where the wine was hidden He could not have done a finer piece of work , " Bombolini said . They could not take their eyes away from the stain . Each moment , as the sun rose higher and the mist burned away , the color grew in strength and in depth and the glass shone more brightly to match the sun itself . Old Vines came out of the cellar and looked at the mountain . " We never should have disturbed the wine , " he said . " This is His curse for disturbing the wine . "  | When they could stand looking at the stain no longer they went back across the sand to the Big Room . Cavalcanti the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who claimed he could pedal a bike for two days without stopping , was turning the generator and the lights were glowing and the men with the bricks were ready to begin to lay them , but when they saw the faces of Bombolini and Tufa and the rest , they stopped what they were doing . " There is no sense going on , " Bombolini said . " To home and to bed . There is a purple arrow in our heart . " They did n't know what the Captain was talking about . They sat in the dim coolness and looked into the dark mouth of the second cellar where the tiers of wine sat . " We came a long way , " one of them said . ' We made a try . We did n't quit without a fight . " Suddenly Vittorini got to his feet . You see Vittorini in the dim light , because he was already wearing his uniform so that he might stand at Bombolini 's side in the piazza when the Germans came , a representative of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Everybody to his feet . We have a solution , " the old soldier said . " We shall wash the mountain . " They tried to think of ways that it would n't work , because they had given up and the effort to save the wine once more was too much then to face . " There is no water , " Guido Pietrosanto said . ' We used the last of it last night . " ' We 'll pump some more , " Vittorini said . " Longo ? Can you get the pump back up the mountain ? " Longo was asleep against the wall . When his work was done he had drunk a good deal of wine . But when they woke him he said he could get the pump and the generator up the mountain and that the bricklayers would have to go on by torchlight . " I do n't want to be the one to wake the people , " Fabio said . " I could n't bear to look at them . " " They 've had two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pietrosanto said . There were the carts and oxen which had brought down the  | bricks . They got in the carts , and on the way back up most of them slept . When the oxen stopped  --  since some of them were as tired as the men and had less to gain for their work  --  they kicked them , and when the kicks no longer worked they burned them on the bellies with the pieces of rope that had been dipped in tallow . It would be good to say that the people responded to the crisis with good humor , but it was n't true . Most of them were angry at being awakened . " You lied to us , " they said . " Come on , get up , " the men would say to them . " Get your water jug , get your chamber pot , get your buckets . We 're going to wash the mountain . " They got up , but they were angry . Once again there was a line on the mountain . This time they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they filled the jugs and bottles and walked back across the terraces to the goat path . At first it was no good . The water did n't thin the wine , the wine here is so heavy and dark , but it spread the wine and made it brighter and the air was thick with the smell of sour wine . There was nothing to do , however , but to go on and finally at ten o'clock in the morning , after perhaps a hundred thousand gallons of water had been poured on the side of the mountain the wine began to thin and the earth began to swallow the wine and the water . Young boys had been coming down the path with grape baskets strapped to their backs and these were filled with glass . The people 's spirits kept rising , because in another hour , if the sun stayed out and the wind held , the earth would begin to dry and by noon no one would be able to tell what had taken place there . It had rained the day before , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swarming up from the south . If they brought rain again it might do good , but if the clouds only served to hide the sun it could prove fatal . " Send for the priest , " Bombolini ordered . Before Padre Polenta was brought down from the bell tower , Capoferro was already in the little piazza before the Fat Gate rolling his sticks on the goatskin drum and shouting at the sun . " Come on , you bastard up there , burn us , " he shouted . " Bake us , fry us , boil us , singe us , dry us up . "  | Capoferro is one of those here who believe that God lives in the sun , just as there are those who believe He lives in the moon , although they never tell that to Polenta . When they brought the priest down the mayor seized him . " We need your prayers , " Bombolini said . " Say the prayers for sun . " There are no prayers for sun , " the priest said . " People always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ark I suppose the people prayed for rain ? " Babbaluche said . " That was before organized religion , " Polenta said . " Ah , all they had was God , the poor bastards , " the cobbler said . In the end , however , they came to a sound religious compromise . The priest agreed to read the prayer for rain and everytime he came to the word he paused and the people said " sun . " At times the prayer made little sense , but God must have been able to understand what the people were trying to tell Him , , since mysteries are nothing new to Him , and not too long after the prayer was said the clouds slid over Scarafaggio on the other mountain , and our wet earth began to bake again . After the prayers it was a time for listening again and for waiting for the false wall to grow and for re-laying the wine in the Cooperative Wine Cellar . It was Fungo the idiot who thought of the last , and perhaps Fungo too deserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways to put down wine , but in general there are two ways , the tight way which we use here and the loose way which is used in wineries that have a great deal of room to spare . In the loose way , the bottles are placed in such a fashion that they do n't touch one another . It takes a good deal of room , more room than we have here , but it reduces the chance of bottles breaking when accidents happen , and so it is used when there is room . Where Fungo learned of it no one knows , because Fungo would n't say . Some people think that Fungo hears holy voices that direct him ; and who is prepared to prove they do n't ? Instead of going home to bed the wine-layers were put to work in the Cooperative cellar and all that morning and afternoon they spread the last of the  | bottles , so by midafternoon the 300,000 bottles almost filled the great room and were made to look as if they were at least 600,000 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drainage ditches and in the reeds and rushes along the side of the River Road with high-pitched little whistles carved from reeds by Babbaluche and his family in the night . The boys were spread out along the road as far apart as they could go and still hear the next whistle down the line . When the first of them saw the Germans approach he was to blow on his whistle and it would be picked up by the next along the line and all the way up to Santa Vittoria so that we would have an early warning of their arrival in case they came too soon or in case they came late under the cover of darkness . In that way we would have some chance to put away things and to hide signs that might be revealing , to sweep the sand around the entrance to the cellars , to put back up the brick wall of the Cooperative cellar , to get the people out of the piazzas and to get people down onto the terraces . But most of the worry was with the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " It grows , it grows , " Bombolini would say . But the work went slowly . The light of the flares was bad and it caused smoke , and the men were on the edge of exhaustion . But , as Bombolini said , it grew and it would n't stop growing . It was two feet by eleven o'clock , and six feet by noon , and eight feet by the time the people had had their bread and soup and the old people at least and some of the women had fallen asleep . At one o'clock a boy rode up the mountain on a mule and he had good news to tell the town . The wall would be finished no later than two o'clock that afternoon , three good hours before the Germans came . At fifteen minutes before two o'clock , Italo Bombolini and Tufa and Pietrosanto and Vittorini and Fabio and Roberto and twenty other members of the Grand Council of Santa Vittoria went through the Fat Gate and started down the mountain . Every so often they stopped to listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they heard nothing they went on . The men had done a good job . They had done a fine job . It is not too much to say that it is doubtful if such a wall could have  | been built in such time and under such circumstances in many parts of the world . It is not to boast , but it is a fact and part of history that Italians have a genius for stone and brick . From the floor of the cellar entrance in the back wall of the Big Room to the arched ceiling , the bricks had been fitted with enormous care , shaped and fitted to the old bricks of the wall so that they looked as if they had grown there and not been laid by the hand of man . " You have done a great thing for yourself and for the people of Santa Vittoria , " Bombolini said . He cried . What had been that morning a gaping entrance to a great ancient wine-filled cellar was now one solid blank wall . The cellar and the wine were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor and others , too tired to listen and even to sleep , rested against the wall , so almost none of them , the first time at least , heard what Tufa said . " The wall will have to come down , " Tufa said . The ones who heard him , or wanted to hear him , turned around . " Why did you say that , Tufa ? " one said . " The wall will have to come down , " he said again . Tufa at times can have such a voice , so cold and hollow and distant that it seems like an echo from the back of a cave . " It 's no good , " he said . " The wall wo n't do . It will have to come down . " No one noticed Luigi Casamassima , who had been the leader of bricklayers , get up from along the wall and come behind Tufa and put his hands around his neck . " You 're crazy , Tufa , " Luigi shouted . " You 're a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He turned to the rest of them . " Do n't let Tufa say things like that . " " You 're doing that , Luigi , because you know it 's true . " Casamassima took his hands away then , but Tufa turned to him and his voice was low and not cold . " You should have stopped , Luigi . You should have had the courage to stop . " " We could n't stop , " Luigi said . " We were too tired to stop . All we could do was go on . "  | When they turned back to the false wall , all of them could see it then . " It stands out like a new grave , " one of them said .  | CAPTAIN VON PRUM 's convoy was scheduled to move out of the Piazza Frossimbone and start down toward the Constantine Gate at 2:30 P.M. , and at 2:25 Sergeant Traub gave the order to start up the engines . The truck motor started but the motorcycle was silent . Sergeant Traub climbed off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was sitting in the sidecar and got down on his knees to examine the engine . Heinsick was looking over his shoulder . " The spark plugs , " the corporal said . " Some son of a bitch has stolen your spark plugs . " Traub looked defeated . " It will take me two days to get some plugs , " he said . Heinsick put a hand on the sergeant 's shoulder . " Field expedi-  | ency , " he said . He walked down the lane that leads out of the piazza until he came to a line of vehicles pulled up in the shadows of the lane hiding under camouflage nets . He looked both ways in the lane and then slipped under the netting and several minutes later came back up the lane juggling several spark plugs in his hand . " When in Italy , " Heinsick said , " do as the wops do . Rob the bastards blind . " Only one minute late the convoy started down toward the gate . The motorcycle was at the head and behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the command of Heinsick . In the back of the truck , squashed tightly , were five other private soldiers and behind the truck was the dual-purpose gun . At the gate they were forced to wait for clearance . " I would n't want to be going up there , " one of the German guards said . " Eight men . " The Italian guard was very upset about it . " Not enough men , " he said . " An insult , do n't you see ? Fifty men , a hundred men , what can anyone do . But eight men . They have to fight if only to defend their honor . " " Maybe they have no honor , " one of the Germans said . The Italian was hurt . " You insult them , " he said . " I 'm warning you . You insult me . " They laughed at him . " Even so , I would n't want to be going up there , " a German said . " Shall I tell them about the Bloodless Victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let them read about it in history , " von Pram said . At a little after three o'clock a sergeant came out of the guard house at the gate and handed Sergeant Traub their convoy clearance . " Santa Vittoria , eh ? " he said . " That 's right , Sanda Viddoria , " Traub said . They drove down the long steep hill that leads from Montefalcone to the River Road and there they turned left toward the city . There was no traffic along the road , and although it was filled with small potholes from aerial cannon fire they made very good time . The road from Montefalcone is said to be very beautiful ,  | The tourists today come and get out of their buses and take pictures of it and so there must be something beautiful about it . But the people who are born here never notice it at all . The road represents an enemy who must be overcome ; the road is so much sweat and so many hours . Captain von Prum enjoyed the ride . He was glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ideas to the test . " And so begins the first phase of the Bloodless Victory , " the captain said , and Sergeant Traub nodded . " We can find a place for ourselves in history up there , Sergeant , " the captain said , and Traub nodded again . And a grave too , he thought . When the convoy was a mile from the road  --  it is a cart track , really , made for oxen and carts by the feet of oxen and the wheels of carts  --  von Prum raised his arm and signaled , and they came to a stop under the shade of a beech tree that for some reason had been allowed to stand . " We 're early , we must wait , " the captain said . To the left of the road were low hills , and the captain and the sergeant got out of the motorcycle and walked across to the hill and went up it and when they were near the top they were able to see our mountain and Santa Vittoria on the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightened the city that morning were over the city then , and for a moment it would be thrown into shadows and then the cloud would pass and it would spring back into the brightness of the sun so that from a distance it looked very clean and sparkling and to some people , since it is so high up and remote from the world down around its feet , even mysterious . " That 's it , " Captain von Prum said . " That 's your city . " " It 's like all the rest , " the sergeant said . " Except it 's our city . " He had binoculars and they were good ones and he could see things all along the road and up the road and among the terraces and he could even make out the faces of people who were gathered about the Fat Gate . " There are people going up the road , a whole group of them , " Sergeant Traub said . His eyesight was keener than the captain 's , and he had been handed the glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew the language that well I could read their lips , " Traub said . " I 'll tell you what they 're talking about . About the weather and about the grapes and about wine . It is all they talk about . " The sergeant had moved the glasses down the mountain and along the road and on the cart track , near where it turns off the River Road , around a corner from it , he could see some obstruction in the road . " They 've put something on the road , sir , " Sergeant Traub said . " Is there anyone around it . Any sign of anyone ? " Traub studied the area with the carefulness of a good soldier . There was no sign of any kind of life . " It 's a cart . Just a cart along the track . " It caused von Prum to smile . " What a splendid Italian gesture , " the captain said . " Obvious , childish , annoying and ineffective . " They started back down the hill toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men they had seen on the mountain were Bombolini and Tufa and the others coming from the Roman cellar . They were halfway up the mountain then , and none of them had said a word . They were too tired then and too disappointed . They had come that far , they had come that close to succeeding , they had licked it and so they knew the taste of it , and now it was denied to them . All of the pieces had fitted into place except the last one , the main one , the doorway to the wine . " Let 's not tell the people , " Bombolini said . " It wo n't do them any good to know . " " Tell them , " Tufa said . " They know everything else . They have a right to know . " Fabio was forced to smile at hearing the ex-Fascist putting his trust in the people . When they reached The Rest , the place where everyone always stops on his way up the mountain , they stopped as much from habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the valley .  | " Now you want to quit and I wo n't let you quit , " Tuf a said to them . " Why do you tell us now ? " someone asked him . " Because I hope the shock of the wall has died in you , " Tufa said . " The shock of the wall will never die in me , " Bombolini said . " If the Germans do n't look in the entrance on their way up , if the Germans do n't look in the entrance tonight , if the Germans do n't look in the cellar tomorrow the wall will be built . " " Ah , yes , " Bombolini said . No one wanted to believe Tufa . It was too much to believe and too exhausting to hope . " The Germans wo n't look in the tunnel . They 'll go right by the tunnel and not look in . " He turned on Tufa . " You yourself told us how thorough they were . " But the false wall was coming down . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first of the bricks being dropped into the great copper kettles that we use here to blend all the wines and ingredients that go into our vermouth . The kettles , the most valuable property in Santa Vittoria , had been brought down the mountain to be hidden behind the wall along with the wine , so that they would n't be taken too . The problem with the wall had been the bricks . They were not new , they were very old bricks , but they were bricks that had been bleached by several hundred years of sun and leached by thousands of winter rains and scoured by winds too numerous to be considered . As Babbaluche had said , they stood out in the darkness of the rest of the back wall like a monk in a house of pleasure . Now they were being dyed . The credit for this belongs to Old Vines . The bricks were being dumped into the huge copper kettles which had been filled with several hundred bottles of our best red vermouth , a painful way to use good wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank it into their open pores , and they turned a deep , rich , dark red , as dark and rich as the wine itself . While the bricks drank , the bricklayers were painting the rest of the wall around the opening with the wine so that when the false wall rose again , the bricks would blend and belong to one another . " It 's as I said , " Old Vines said . " The wine will save the wine . "  | They got up from The Rest and were started back up again when Tufa saw the cart along the cart track . " What is that ? " he said . " Who put that along the road ? " " A cart , " Bombolini said . " My cart to be exact . I allowed Fabio della Romagna and the Cavalcanti boy to put it there this morning . " Tufa 's face was annoyed and finally angry . " As a gesture of defiance , you know , " Bombolini said . " If that cart makes them late , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tufa said . " Do you know they like to be on time ? Do you know they hurt people for things such as that ? " " It was only a gesture , a small thing , " Bombolini said . " So was the answer that the man gave them at Rocca di Camera , " Tufa said . " They asked him which direction the enemy was and he said , Why , I thought the enemy was you , ' and for that they shot his wife and they shot his children and they allowed him to live with his joke . " " I could go down and move the cart , " Fabio said , but Tufa told him there was n't time for that now , and that it was better that no one be near the cart when they came . They went up in silence after that . There were some people among the vines on the terraces and a few were working , but a great many of them had fallen asleep in the shade beneath the leaves . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , let them sleep . It will only confirm what they already think of us , " Tufa said , " that we 're a bunch of lazy bastards . " When they neared the Fat Gate some of the people came down the track to meet them . " How 's the wall ? How does it look ? Is it all grown up ? " they asked . Bombolini looked at Tufa and Tuf a stared back at him . " It still grows . They 're still working on the wall . " The people were astonished and frightened by what they heard . " But they said . . . "  | Bombolini shook his head . " No , " he said . " They were wrong . The wall still grows . " It made him sad to say that . " I wish we had Mazzola back , " he said to Pietrosanto . " I wish we had Copa , " Pietrosanto said . Although they had not done much work in recent years both Copa and Mazzola had once been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brick . " You did what you had to do ? " Bombolini said to Pietrosanto . " Yes . The problem is solved . The Band is all taken care of . " Bombolini put his hands over his ears . " Do n't tell me , " he said . " I do n't want to hear about it . " He looked at Pietrosanto with a new respect , however . " Was it terrible ? Did you find it hard to do ? " " No , it was n't hard to do , " Pietrosanto said , and then he stopped very suddenly , almost locked in motion , as if he had come face to face with an invisible barrier . " Did you hear it ? " he asked . " Do you hear it now ? Quiet , " he shouted . The people by the Fat Gate and the people around them and they themselves were quiet , and then they heard , all the way down the valley , not just one whistle but many of them , high and thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as high and clear as the cry of a wild bird . They were coming . They were moving on the River Road , they were rushing along the Mad River , they were looking for the turn to the cart track that leads to the foot of our mountain , they were taking the turn and coming into the valley . Bombolini had run up the Corso Cavour for several hundred feet when he heard the reed whistles , but then he turned around and started back down the street until he found Tufa . " Tufa ? " he said . " What shall I wear ? " " Wear what you have on , " Tufa said . " Be yourself . " " What should I say to them ? " " Nothing . Answer what they ask you . " " But how do I act ? I do n't know how to act . " " Like yourself , " Tufa said .  | " But I do n't know how I act . " Tufa started up the Corso and Bombolini , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Tufa ? " he called after him . " You know what to say . You know how to act . " Tufa continued to move away from him . " I want you to be the one to meet him , " Bombolini called to him . " I want you to take command . I 'm not enough . " Tufa stopped then . " I 'm not the mayor of Santa Vittoria , you 're the mayor  --  the Captain of the People . Is n't that what they call you ? " Bombolini nodded . Still they could hear the fine sharp notes of the whistles blowing and blowing . " The people chose you , Bombolini , not Tufa , " he said . And then he said something remarkable , which Bombolini never forgot and did n't understand . " You 'll make a much better mayor than I could ever make . " He was tired . The running had winded him and he could only walk now and do that slowly . " They 're coming , eh , Bombolini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't turn to look . " Yes , they 're coming . " " There 's nowhere to run to now , eh ? " " No , there 's nowhere to run . " " All we can do now is stand here and wait . " " It 's all we can do , " Bombolini said .  | THEN THERE WERE ten minutes less than an hour left , since Captain von Prum had estimated it would take them fifty minutes to cross the valley and go up the mountain , he struck the flat of his hand against the sidecar , making a hollow boom , and raised his hand and shouted " Forward , " and the convoy moved out of the shade of the beech tree and onto the River Road . It is difficult to see the track that turns off to Santa Vittoria , since it dips down off the road so suddenly , but Sergeant Traub saw it in time and turned off the road a little faster than he would have liked , steeply down , and at the first turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to be , was the cart , and he was forced to apply his brakes so sharply that von Prum was almost  | thrown out of the sidecar and the truck behind them came close to hitting them . Traub got off the seat to examine the cart . " I never saw one like it before , " he said . He spun one of the heavy iron-rimmed wheels . " Oak , " he said . " Like iron . It 's as heavy as a tank . " " Can we get around it ? Can we lift it off ? " Traub told the captain no . " Can you hit it with one shot ? " " I can hit anything with one shot if it is n't shooting back at me , " the sergeant said . " I 'm sure they 're all looking from the town , " von Prum said . " This will be a lesson . " They unhitched the light dual-purpose gun from the back of the truck and they ran it up onto the edge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful about it , a little longer than von Prum would have wished , but he made the first shot good . It hit near the heart of the cart and it split the oak grain and a shower of splinters flew out . He hit it again and again after that , until it came apart and looked naked and disgraceful in the sand . They lifted the pieces up then and threw them alongside the track , and it was the death of Bombolini 's Sicilian cart . " It 's been a long time , " Traub said . He was proud of his work . " I like the way it jumps when it cuts loose . " The road was dusty , and when they had gone perhaps a half mile more across the valley they stopped to clean the dust from their eyes and mouths and to put on glasses . The truck behind them was buried in a cloud of fine white chalk . " They should pay for things like that , " Traub said . He motioned back toward the cart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell of oil and the powder and the hot metal under his hands and the feeling of satisfaction he had felt when the shell had entered the oak and split it apart . " It 's like with a puppy , sir . You are n't cruel , but you make them pay for their annoyances . " A kind of reasoned ruthlessness , the captain thought . An enlightened ruthlessness . A civilized ruthlessness . He wrote that down later . " You want to hit something else ? " the captain asked .  | " Yes . " Out of all the grays and the dull reds and oranges , out of the sun-bruised brick and stone and plaster , the coloring of stone and smoke and old age that is Santa Vittoria , one piece of color stands out above all the colors of the city , the red-and-blue sign of the Cinzano company on the roof of the Cooperative Wine Cellar . " That ? " von Prum said . " Do you think you could hit it ? " The sergeant nodded . The first shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on the mountain behind the city . He told us later that he fired this way so that no one would be hurt . By that shot he was able to adjust his fire , and the second shot struck the sign and exploded against it . When it did n't go down right away , he fired a third shot and the sign started down then , falling off the roof like a goose or a wild swan that has been hit with shot but is unwilling to die at once because of it . " I think we 've made our first impression , " Captain von Prum said . They moved slowly after that , to keep down the dust and because the road was not fit for a speed much faster than that of an ox . One of the children who was to blow his reed whistle had come out along the track and was blowing it so that his face had turned red . They stopped and watched him . " What 's the matter with him do you think ? " The child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes would come out of his head . " I think he 's crazy , " the sergeant said . " They have these little boys tend the goats all alone and sometimes they go crazy . " In another ten minutes they had reached the bottom of the mountain where they saw Fungo , who in truth looks crazy when he smiles , sweeping the sand in front of the entrance to the Roman tellers . " Another one , " Sergeant Traub shouted . They had turned and started up through the terraces , the first motor vehicle ever to attempt to come up the mountain , when the captain looked back once more at Fungo and the cellar entrance . " A place to examine , " he said , and Traub nodded . " It might make a good place for an air-raid shelter . "  | When they were halfway up the mountain they stopped to allow the engines of their vehicles to cool . Among the vines and beneath the leaves they could see people hiding in the shadows or people sleeping . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ von Prum told the sergeant . There would be the mayor of the city in his one black suit stained with wine and manure , and several old men holding flags and with their medals from the other war dangling from their worn shirts , and there would be the members of the Fascist party swearing undying allegiance to those who had come to conquer them , the captain told him . It was ten minutes before five o'clock . Just before they started up again Captain von Prum sampled some of the grapes that grew alongside the cart track and they were bitter . Paolo Lapolla had the bad fortune to be near them . " What 's the matter with your grapes ? " von Prum asked Paolo . At first Paolo found it impossible to find his tongue . " They are n't ripe yet , " he finally said . " You came too soon . " It caused the Germans to laugh . " When would you have wished us to come , next year ? " " Later , later , " Paolo said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How is your wine ? " " Ah , the wine , " Paolo said . " The wine is something else . You must try some of it sometime . " " Ah , we will , " von Prum said , " we will . " Paolo was frightened by the loudness of their laughter . " You speak very good Italian , " Paolo said . " So do you , " von Prum said . " Yes , I was born right here , Your Excellency , " Paolo said . At the Fat Gate and wherever they could see down into the terraces they were fearful about Paolo and what he might say , but Bombolini , when they told him , had no fear . As the Master said , it is sometimes the highest form of wisdom to simulate folly , and at this Paolo was a master , for it is something every Santa Vittorian learns by the time he leaves the breast .  | All up the Corso Cavour and up into the Piazza of the People the people were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the fringes of the piazza , because it was foolish now , . after the destruction of the cart and the blowing down of the signs to pretend they knew nothing of the Germans ' arrival . They were silent and they were composed , on the advice of Bombolini , who said that they should treat the arrival as they would treat the passing of a hearse ; no one would go into the street and run after the hearse , and no one would turn away from it , either . There was even a quiet kind of elation among them , because the tunnel had been seen and the tunnel had been passed . Only Fabio seemed to be upset . " Eight of them and an officer , against one thousand of us , " he said . " What has happened to my country ? " When the sound of the engines could be heard coming up the Corso Cavour , Fabio left the piazza and went up to High Town and over the wall and into the mountains . The Corso is bad for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pipe , but it is good for sound . The noise of the engines thundered up the pipe and roared in the piazza and even the people at the far corners found themselves becoming stiff . There were , in the center of the piazza then , only two people : Italo Bombolini , the mayor , and Emilio Vittorini in the dress uniform of his old regiment . And behind them was the Fountain of the Pissing Turtle . The motorcycle was the first to come into the piazza . Because of the steepness of the Corso the people could not see it until it had come up onto the lip of the street where for a moment it seemed to waver and hang suspended , half in the piazza and half in the Corso . Then it seemed to catch hold of the cobblestones of the piazza and to explode out into it . They must have seen the two men but they did n't go directly toward them but turned to the right and circled the piazza , roaring along the rim of people , who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going all the way around the piazza and back to where the Corso begins . Bombolini and Vittorini kept turning with them so that they would always be facing them , much as the matador does when a bull is on the loose in the arena .  | Once was not enough for them and they went around the piazza a second time , until the truck and the little cannon had ground up into the piazza and could follow them . They went faster this time , with a great noise of engines and the crying of rubber on the stones . It was impressive . It was terribly impressive . There had been a great many who had denied that any motor vehicle could ever come up the Corso and get into the piazza . At a sign from the officer , the truck pulled to one side of the square and the soldiers leaped from the truck and unhitched the gun and pointed it out across at the people . And when this was done , the motorcycle very sharply turned and only then headed directly toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump , but everyone knew Vittorini would never move . It seemed to us then that Bombolini would be forced to break and run if the machine was not to hit him , but he too stood in the piazza as if this was the ordained thing to do . Some in the piazza at that moment turned away , but the motorcycle , with a terrible screeching of brakes , came to a stop less than a foot away from the two of them and actually at the edge of Bombolini 's shoe . " Welcome to the Free City of Santa Vittoria , " Bombolini shouted above the sound of the engine . " We of this city know that in times of war . . . " It was the last they heard , as Traub raced the engine and the mayor 's voice was lost beneath it . " Pay attention , " Traub shouted . He shut off the engine . Captain von Prum rose in the sidecar . " Have sixteen mattresses delivered into this piazza within the next twenty minutes , " von Prum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was beginning the execution of a formal military salute . " We know that in time of war ? " Bombolini began . " Quiet , " Sergeant Traub shouted . " Sixteen , " von Prum said to Bombolini . " Did you understand that ? " Bombolini nodded his head . " I want you to know , sir , that we are willing and anxious to  | cooperate with you as guests of the city , exactly as we would do if we were running an inn . " " " With no bedbugs , " Traub shouted . " With no lice . With no ticks . With no bugs of any kind . " Bombolini continued to talk , but they did n't hear him . The sergeant had gotten down from the seat of the motorcycle and had gone around and opened the door of the sidecar for the captain . " Words flow out of his mouth like piss from that turtle , " Captain von Prum said . They began to walk toward the fountain . " Go ahead , " von Prum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked around the fountain and examined it carefully and came back past Vittorini , and the captain touched the old soldier 's epaulets . " Do you know that a museum would give you good money for these ? " he said . Vittorini was still at parade salute . Von Prum stopped in front of the mayor . " Why did you stop talking ? " he asked . " I had nothing further to say , " Bombolini said . " Do you expect us to believe that ? " von Prum said . " Would you like to hear what the sergeant said about you ? " Bombolini nodded his head . " He said you were like the piazza ; very large and very empty . " He had said the words very loudly , and someone in the piazza laughed . It was Babbaluche . " And what is he doing ? " von Prum said . " He is waiting for you to return his salute , sir . " Vittorini 's arm and even his body were now trembling from the effort of holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " von Prum said . " Because he is an old soldier , sir . " " Oh , is that what he is ? " Von Prum took several steps away from Bombolini and came to a stop in front of him and came to attention . He lifted his arm and shouted " Heil Hitler . " " Long live Italy , " Vittorini said . " It is my hope that we can find a way of living here that will be profitable for both of us , " Bombolini said .  | " I will insist on it , " the German said . He was back in the sidecar then , and Traub started up the motorcycle . It made a great noise , but it did not start at once . It seemed to strain to release itself , much like a young horse held to a stake , and then it broke loose . As it did the foot pedal on the left side of the cycle struck Bombolini 's leg and it sent him moving backward . Had he fallen at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might have even alarmed the people . But he did n't go down at once . He began to fall and to run backward at the same time , going a little faster at each step , trying to keep his balance but losing it a little more at each step , going backward and down , clutching the air to hold him up . There must have been twenty desperate steps in this way before he was moving at such a speed and was bent over backward so far that in the end nothing could support him and he went down , flatly down , fully down , on his back , so that his legs flew up in the air and hovered there as if he were about to do a backward somersault . He was stunned by the fall but not hurt by it , and then he could hear them beginning . Please God , Bombolini said to himself , do n't let them do it . Not in front of them . But they did do it . It began as a titter and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titter long . It became a laugh , and because of the way sounds carry in the Piazza of the People , it became a gigantic laugh , a thunderous , booming laugh , that fed on its own noise , laughter creating new laughter until it went beyond anything that had to do with Bombolini lying on his back in the center of the piazza , but must have been a cry at everything they had done and knew they were going to have to do . The Germans heard it , although they were already down in the Corso Cavour making their first reconnaissance of the city . " I do n't understand these people at times , sir , " Traub said . " It 's because in many ways they are like children , " Captain von Prum said , " and so they react like children . " " I do n't understand them . " Get up , Vittorini was saying . You ca n't lie there . The mayor was on his knees looking at the stones he had fallen on .  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this place . On this rock . " He got to his feet and he marked one cobblestone with the sole of his shoe . He looked at the people and nodded his head at them , over and over . All right , he was saying to himself , you can laugh . Laugh now . One day , right here , on this stone , you will erect a monument to me.  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | be a benevolent despot up here , " he put in his personal log , " but to be benevolent one must first be the despot . " On that first night , for example , a curfew was set for eight o'clock at night . It was too late to warn the bricklayers , and when they came up the mountain at ten o'clock , after finishing the second wine-dark wall , they were jailed for breaking the curfew and they were whipped . " I am sorry to have to do this , but these men have broken the rules and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's only correct , " Bombolini said . " They have been bad and deserve it . " The bricklayers did n't mind . They were so tired they were numb , and later said they had barely felt the blows . Nothing mattered to them . Some of them slept all through the three days of their confinement and never missed the food they were supposed to be deprived of . Padre Polenta was arrested and brought down from the bell tower for using his light at night . " And what was your aim ? " Captain von Prum asked him . " To guide the bombers in ? " " I was at God 's work , " Polenta said . " One week on bread and water for God 's work , " the captain said . " Why not a few strokes of the lash as well , " Bombolini offered . " He might have gotten us all blown up . " These were n't the only ones . Many people were arrested that first week and treated roughly , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaned up the dung hills in Old Town and they fined people who emptied their night jars in the streets outside their doors . They beat the people who opened their doors after eight o'clock or who showed a light of any kind . At the end of that first week Captain von Prum wrote this letter to his father . So far so good . It goes better than we ever hoped or dreamed . I keep my fingers crossed . I try to keep in mind that saying from Clausewitz that you always quote : " The first rule . Never underestimate the nature and the quality of the enemy . " I had not intended to work with the mayor here , but he is so available and so willing to please and carry out our requests that I find  | it useful . He is a clown and , as I think I wrote you before , these people have an affinity for clowns . But he also seems to get things done . I 'll try not to underestimate him . I try to remind myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even widsom , although I must admit that in this case it is hard to see . He wrote that he had been stern and that he had twisted the screw tight and that now he was going to release the pressure a little ? " If things go right the people will be grateful for small treats , " he wrote . It was one of the captain 's beliefs that decency not backed by superior force was merely a symptom of weakness . " The weak have to be decent , while the strong can choose to be decent . This coming week I will choose to be decent . " He had taken over the Palace of the People that first day , but it was too large and gloomy for his needs , and Bombolini had persuaded him to cross the Piazza of the People and move into the home of Constanzia Pietrosanto , which was small but well built and clean and airy and light . Constanzia wept and cried , and she shouted at her brothers and sisters . " Why me ? Why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German to me ? " " Quiet , " they told her . " Bombolini has a reason . It 's for the cause , for the wine . " And then one morning , at the end of the week , she was delivered an envelope by Corporal Heinsick and in it was fifty lire , and they came every week after that . Under the rules of war the German had no need to pay , but he chose to pay . The rest of the soldiers were quartered in the office of the Cooperative Wine Cellar , all except Sergeant Traub , who had a room with the captain in Constanzia 's house . He might have put them in private homes , but he did n't want his men to go soft or to face the temptation of corruption , and he paid the city of Santa Vittoria for the use of the wine cellar office . Each week he gave Italo Bombolini fifty lire , and it was the only source of income in the entire city . " You see ? " Sergeant Traub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's fair . You watch . You have a friend here , whether you know it or not . Just so you cooperate . "  | It was always that word . " I think I 'm winning them over , " the captain wrote to his fiancee Christina Mollendorf . " Each day a little more I earn their cooperation . " He did n't know then , and he never did know , that Bombolini 's policy , which he had actually written down , was named Creative Cooperation . We did n't just go along , we tried to do the German one better . We did n't grudgingly do what was asked , we did it eagerly and willingly . There was a great deal of smiling going on in Santa Vittoria those first weeks . We smiled at the soldiers , and although they were supposed to be firm , they began to respond and smile back . There was a great deal of saying " Good morning " and " Good evening . " We learned the name of the captain and used it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How are you today , Captain von Prum . " When he walked down the Corso Cavour they said his name so often , von Prum , von Prum , that it sounded as if someone was filling a barrel with apples . And then we had the Good Time Boys . These were groups of younger men whose job it was to drink with the German soldiers and to play cards with them and smile at them . They met in the soldiers ' quarters , in the wine cellar office , and it was a convenient place . They were next to the source of wine and , as Babbaluche said , what better place for rabbits than the edge of the rabbit garden . The people would say , " Are they in it ? Have they gone over the fence ? " And the Good Time Boys would tell them , " They 're looking . They 're nibbling . " They would look at the wine and rub their jaws , but they never took any of it . The Good Time Boys went in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an eye opener of grappa and some in the middle of the morning for a little pick-me-up of vermouth and some to bring wine for lunch and an after-nap refresher , and in the evening the serious drinking began with the card playing . The result was that the Germans and the Italians became friends , and the Germans were drunk a good deal of the time and some of them drunk all of the time . They would fall on their blankets at night and smile at us with those cowlike drunk blue eyes of theirs .  | There is a saying in this country and it must be true . " No one knows his own servants as badly as the master . " Captain von Prum saw none of it . Tufa put it this way : " Until his own life is at stake an officer can never know what is going on with his own men . " Von Prum 's mind was on other matters . He was exuberant about the way the first phase of the Bloodless Victory was proceeding . It was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he finally felt he must speak to the Italian mayor , and he summoned Bombolini to his office on the evening of his eighth day in Santa Vittoria . " You are so cooperative with us . Why ? " von Prum said . " There must be a reason . " He had intended to shock the mayor . " The obvious one , " Bombolini told him . " It is selfish , I suppose . If we help you we hope that maybe you wo n't hurt us . We hope that you might even help us . " There was nothing for the captain to say except that it was a very realistic way of looking at things , and very mature . " We do n't see this as our war , " the mayor said . " It does n't matter to us who wins or loses , all we stand to do is get hurt by it . " " But you 're Italians . " " What does that mean to us ? " Bombolini said . " All we want to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us the least harm in the end . " The proposition , which was always at the back of Captain von Prum 's mind , was going to be easier to propose than he had hoped . " So you 're willing to work with us even though we are Germans , " he said . " We do n't care who you are , " Bombolini said . " Look at it this way , sir . We do n't love you and we do n't ask you to love us . This is like a game and you hold all the trump cards and so we have to play our hand so at least we lose as little as possible . " The German told the mayor once again that it was very realistic of him . " You scratch my back , I 'll scratch yours , " Bombolini said . " Something for you , something for me . You lend me your mule , I 'll lend you my ox . "  | All of these things are in the captain 's notes . He liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Use this one , " he wrote down . " Self-interest is their motivation , " he wrote . " Appeal to their sense of self-preservation . They love themselves more than their country . " * * * It was n't the only time they talked . Each time they met , the German pushed the conversation one or two steps nearer to the proposition . " So you would be willing to cooperate with the German if it meant preserving yourself ? " " The first duty of every Italian is to preserve himself , " Bombolini said . " What good does it do me or my country if I get killed ? Right ? " " Very mature way of thinking , " von Prum said . " They are marvelous in their way , " von Prum wrote to his father . " They are disgusting , of course , and yet at the same time there is a realism about them that ca n't be denied . This afternoon the clown , this Bombolini , had a proposition for me . He would cooperate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would let him in on it first , so that he could at least offer his views on how it might be done so that it would work and yet cost them as little as possible . He becomes riper by the hour . I have prepared a little test for him to test the quality of his sincerity . " The test was to make an inventory of Santa Vittoria ; to count all the houses and all the people , to list all machinery , to count all tools , and to report the number of bottles of wine in the Cooperative Wine Cellar . " The wine ? " Bombolini said . " Why the wine ? " " Yes , the wine . It 's a property , " the German said . " What makes i you surprised about that ? It 's what you make your living on . " " Yes , but the wine . . . you see , the wine here ... " Bombolini said , and then did n't go on . " You wanted to cooperate , " von @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bombolini shrugged his shoulders . " There 's a lot of wine , " he said . " We do n't count so well . "  | " Then we can count the wine . You count the other things . " " No . Oh , no , " Bombolini said swiftly . " We 'll count the wine . It would n't do for the people to see you counting it . It makes the people nervous . " * * * That night the captain put in his log : " He has the bait and he is running with it . Traub says that he will lie and lie and lie . I do n't know . I suspect Traub is right , but we can only see . The counting begins tonight . " " How many are you going to tell him ? " Old Vines asked Bombolini . " How many bottles are there ? " " Three hundred and seventeen thousand , " the cellar master said . " I do n't know . I 'm not sure , " the mayor said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested . " He 'll never know . " Everyone agreed that Pietrosanto was right . It was very strange . At first everyone had been concerned with saving the wine in the Roman cellar and had already given the wine in the Rabbit Garden away . But as the days went by and the Germans did n't go down the mountain and look into the cellar , they began to hope that they could get away with saving half of the Rabbit Garden too . Bombolini was a little wiser than the rest of them . He went to the captain 's headquarters the next night . " Three hundred and two thousand bottles , " Bombolini told him . The German smiled at him . " Your counting is n't very accurate , " the captain said . " The right number is three hundred and seventeen thousand bottles . We counted them last night . " Bombolini pretended to be greatly embarrassed . " I warned you that we do n't count so well . " " Is n't it odd that the number would be too few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they both smiled at one another and Bombolini knew he had done the correct thing . It was only natural that he would lie . It was expected of him ; it was in  | truth , he knew , required of him . Everyone is fearful and suspicious of the too-honest man . He had lied , but just a little bit . For the most part he had told the truth . When Bombolini had gone , the captain called his sergeant in . " He 's a liar like all of them , but he 's just a little one . I could n't expect it any other way . He has to protect his people , too , you know . " " I do n't know , sir , " Sergeant Traub said . " You know what they say , never trust the wop . " " That can limit you , you know . You can become so suspicious of people that you can do nothing with them in the end . Fifteen thousand out of three hundred thousand bottles is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think . " So he wrote that night in his log , it is dated : " He can be trusted to work with us . I will have to stand on that . He passed the test . "  | AFTER THAT the relations between the two men , the German commander and the Italian mayor , changed very swiftly . They lent each other the ox and the mule and they scratched each other 's back , and what was good for one they attempted to make good for the other . And the attitude of the people changed . At first they were afraid to look at the Germans for fear the Germans could read the thoughts in their heads . Most of the people were fearful that they would n't be able to keep the secret , that in some way their tongues would slip and the terrible words would be said . But as the days and then the weeks passed and the secret held , it became a habit . If the secret had been held by one person alone it might  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
