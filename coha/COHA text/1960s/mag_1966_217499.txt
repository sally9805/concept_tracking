FOREIGN RELATIONS <P> The nation last week offered a vibrant welcome to an Asian statesman who stands to lose more than an argument if the U.S. reneges on its commitments across the Pacific . Only ten months after a resounding election victory , President Ferdinand E. Marcos of the Philippines flew to Washington for a state visit that meant far more to him , and his hosts , than the usual red-carpeted round of pleasantries . For Marcos , it represented a threefold opportunity - to renew a long-standing bond of friendship with the U.S. , to make a case for increased U.S. aid to bail out his stagnating econ omy , and to impress on Americans some home truths about the realities of power in Asia . With willing assistance from Washington , Marcos made the most of his opportunity . <P> <P> Leadership &; Loneliness . Marcos ' good looks , poise and fame as the Philippines ' most decorated hero of World War II ( 27 medals , including the U.S. <P> Distinguished Service Cross ) all contributed to the enthusiastic reception . <P> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , at 36 , is still so pret ty that the latest Filipino entry in the Miss Universe contest could declare without diplomatic deference that at least one woman in the islands was better-looking : the President 's wife . <P> Their first morning in Washington , Marcos and Imelda were escorted to the north portico of the White House . There Lyndon Johnson 's warm greeting reflected his gratitude for Marcos ' decision , in the face of strong congressional opposition and strident criticism from local leftists and nationalists , to commit a 2,000-man Filipino force to Viet Nam . On the eve of his departure for his 15-day U.S. swing , Marcos had seen off 700 members of a security battalion before they boarded two Saigon-bound troopships . Said Johnson , obviously moved : " Your people and mine have shared suffering and victory . So we are not only friends ; we are brothers . " <P> Marcos responded by discarding a memorized four-paragraph speech for a longer , more emotional , off-the-cuff oration . The President of the Philippines paid feeling tribute to the President of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We thank you for utilizing your powers with restraint and wisdom , " said Marcos . " Leadership is the other side of the coin of loneliness , and he who is a leader must always act alone . And acting alone , accept everything alone . " Thanking the U.S. for moving so swiftly after World War II to grant the Philippines independence after 48 years of colonial rule , he declared : " For over seven decades , your nation and mine have walked the path of democracy . We have followed you . And we do not regret it . " <P> Nicely-Nicely Johnson . From then on , it was a whirl of receptions and dinners . Imelda , dressed for each occasion in one of 40 butterfly-sleeved Filipino ter-nos that she had brought along , was usually the center of attention . Her yellow terno caught Lyndon Johnson 's eye . " That is my favorite color too-yellow , " he told her . " Actually , " she confided later , " my favorite color is pink . But he is the President . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
