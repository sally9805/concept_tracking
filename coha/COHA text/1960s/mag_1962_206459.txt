Long Day 's Journey into Night . Life is depicted by primitives as a serpent that eats its own tail . The serpent signifies a state of being in which pleasure and pain , life and death , eating and being eaten are the same thing . To a primitive , this state is paradise . To a conscious man . it is madness . To Eugene O'Neill , it was home . And this home , the family that nourished and devoured him , that cosseted and tortured him to greatness , the playwright has described with withering hatred and burning pity and heartsick unutterable despair in a tragedy that stands among the strangest and strongest of the century . <P> Journey was produced on Broadway in 1956 , three years after the playwright 's death . Translated to the screen by Director Sidney Lumet , who has added nothing to O'Neill 's playscript and taken very little away , Journey provides a raw red slice of family life , liberally garnished with rotgut , morphine , vitriol and sour grapes , that takes more than three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeds the inner man . ' <P> Time : 1912 . Place : a summer house on the New England coast . Characters : <P> FATHER ( Sir Ralph Richardson ) is an aging but still vigorous actor who went hungry as a child and has never forgotten it . As a matinee idol he got rich quick , but for fear of the poorhouse he ruined his career and destroyed his wife . When he made a hit in a cheap meller , he played nothing else for a decade . And when his wife had a pain one night , he sent her to a cheap quack who cynically put the poor girl on morphine . <P> MOTHER ( Katharine Hepburn ) is a charming , drug-ravaged must-have-been-a-beauty who grew up in a convent and dreamed of becoming a nun . But then one day Father swept her off her feet and into a squalid succession of " dirty rooms in one-night-stand hotels . ' ' When the morphine came along she was desperately ready for it , and after more than 20 years of the needle her soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JAMIE ( Jason Robards Jr. ) , the elder son . is a writer who never really wrote and an actor who can hardly act , a noisy Irish drunk who at 33 has just about worn out his ne'er-do-welcome . But he loves his younger brother well enough to warn him that he hates him too and wishes he were dead-that way he would n't have to compare their talents and admit his own inferiority . <P> EDMUND ( Dean Stockwell ) , the younger brother , is O'Neill as he was , or fondly remembered he was , at 23 : a sailor home from the sea with consumption , a secret scribbler who longed to be a poet but guessed he lacked the gift . <P> Story there is almost none . At the beginning of the play the family is wondering whether Edmund has really got consumption and whether Mother , who has just come home from a sanatorium , has really kicked the habit . At the end of the play the family has found out that he has and she has n't . Otherwise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk . True , in the course of the talk they reveal themselves as few characters in all the history of drama are revealed : to the depth of their shallowness , at the height of their absurdity , in the humanity of their inhumanity . But if there is revelation there is no development . In a kind of folie quatre they go over and over and over the same ground , and end where they began-like the serpent that eats its own tail .
