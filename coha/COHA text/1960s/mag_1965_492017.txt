In the main lobby of New York 's Kennedy Airport , dangling from the ceiling like a run of musical notes made visible , 16 red , black and orange discs drift slowly through constantly changing orbits . In a square in Spoleto , Italy , a black , five-legged creature , big enough for cars to drive under and looking like some posthistoric animal , points its arrow-shaped head straight toward the sky . Outside the new Los Angeles County Art Museum , the tips of three tall triangles sprout branches from which brightly colored spheres glide and whirl under the supervision of the breeze and jets from a fountain . Outside the UNESCO building in Paris , a series of rudders on slanted tillers climbs and sways in a surrealistic spiral . And somewhere in Kansas a little old lady is snipping stars and circles out of shirt cardboards , stringing them on picture wire to dangle from a piece of coat hanger , and having the time of her life . Directly or indirectly , all these objects are the product of the fertile mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been operating in a one-man field of his own invention , and whose works have probably had the widest range of appeal of any American art in history . Painter Marcel Duchamp coined the term " mobile " in 1932 to describe Calder 's principal invention : Sculpture which is suspended and moves with the air . Jean Arp then made up " stabile " to describe the Calder works which stand still like other people 's sculpture . Today , Calder is at the height of his popularity . Early this winter 361 Calder works were gathered in New York 's Guggenheim Museum , where over a quarter of a million SOARING ART people came to see them , a record for the museum , and caused the show to be held over for three weeks . On February 21 , half of these pieces open in St. Louis and half in Milwaukee , for one-month stands . In April the two groups will move on to Toronto and another city still to be selected . And on July 1 the entire collection will be in Paris for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in the 20th century to invent and practice an art of his own . A few sculptors had used motion in their works before Calder came along , but aside from the makers of Chinese wind-bells and weather vanes , nobody had made works in which everything moved and motion was of primary importance . Virtually nobody has done it since , either , because Calder 's unique works defy all but the frankest imitation . They have had plenty of that , however . Department stores have carried assemble-ityourself mobiles for about 10 years , particularly at Christmastime . Amateurs , who could not paint a respectable cow and probably never heard of Calder , have happily put together mobiles of their own . It is impossible to buy a " reproduction " of any Calder mobiles , but he has probably made about a thousand of them , ranging from tiny to huge . " I 've done so many of those small mobiles , I could almost do them blindfolded , " he says . " it 's a concession to commerce , although it 's often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or art , the movements of Calder 's mobiles have fascinated everyhoely from children to philosophers and scientists . Dozens of children swung on a sturdy stabile-mobile called Five Rudders dur ing the Guggenheim show . Albert Einstein once spent 40 minutes watching the entire cycle of a motorized mobile called A Universe at the Museum of Modern Art , and reportedly said he wished he had thought of it himself . If creators embodied the qualities of their work , one might expect Calder to be a short , elfin man with the quick grace of a dancer . In fact , he was educated as an engineer and worked , before arriving at the idea of sculpture in motion , as a ship's-boiler stoker , a store clerk in a lumber camp , a draftsman , a department-store efficiency expert , and a cartoonist for the National Police Gazette . Calder used to be fond of dancing , but he weighs 220 pounds , and he prefers to dance solo , improvising strenuously ; one of the few times he danced with a partner . he broke her ankle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders are rounded , and when he is stationary he looks like a bust and torso set on a pedestal . When he moves , however , Calder in many ways is the personification of the mobile . He does everything with natural rhythm , rather slowly but easily . At work , he picks up , lays down , moves , snips and connects at a constant speed . He once spoke of the motion of his bigger mobiles as having " an inertia like a ship coming into dock , " and the description fits Calder 's own movements closely . Also like his mobiles , lie often radiates amusement and a kind of placid mockery of pretension . Calder , whom almost everybody calls Sandy , is an informal man who favors red woolen shirts , and he lives simply and well , with houses in Roxbury , Conn. , and Sache , France , and a cabin in Brittany . He speaks in a low rumble , and a sentence is apt to start with a guttural warm-up , turn gradually into words , and end with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they are sometimes awful . " Did you build these stools as well ? " his son-in-law recently asked him in Roxbury . " As well as I could , " Calder said . He also loves the sort of humor politely described as " earthy . " in the kitchen of the Roxbury house is a wire from a champagne bottle . With a few twists Calder has turned it into a man in an indelicate position . Mrs. Calder is so fond of it that she takes it back and forth between Roxbury and SachE " He has a great capacity for puncturing highfalutin nonsense , " says Klaus Perls , his dealer , " very often in a short , consciously vulgar way . " One result of Calder 's humor , both professional and personal , is that many people have been unable to take Calder 's works altogether seriously . Strangers often greet Calder with the announcement , " I make mobiles too , " which annoys him no end , and his children are often asked whether he really makes a living that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calder 's seriousness was reflected in his prices , which were modest . Today , Calder 's prices are as respectable as they come . They run from a little less than $500 for small , table-model mobiles , up to the 8100,000 asking price for a 22-foot-high stabile called Guillotine for Eight in his current exhibition . A similar elevation has occurred in the words critics use to describe his mobiles . Once , they were ' ' gangling contraptions " which " jumped " and " jiggled . " In Time magazine alone , Calder mobiles have " bounced and joggled , slithered and wogglecl " ( 1937 ) , gone " teetering , swaying , jiggling and bobbing " ( 1945 ) , and " jiggled and joggled " while hanging " jittering " from the ceiling 11951 ) . By 1958 , however , the critical winds had shifted . In Time that year the mobiles were " delicately spun " by the breeze , and Calder was jiggling and woggling no longer . In fact , only the smallest mobiles move with any speed at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like Christy Mathewson being known for his throw to first base . Calder usually works in aluminum , which is easy to cut and shape . The large mobiles and stabiles are built in foundries , from models , with Calder supervising , He uses no power tools , and has invented many of his hand tools , including a gadget for locating the center of gravity of a piece of material , He balances the piece on a metal tip which stands below a metal arm holding a poised nail . He then raps the nail down to mark the central spot . His studio is a magician 's junkyard. overflowing with old models and mobiles , and hits and snips of metal . " / paint with shapes , " he says , describing his methods . " I put them down on the table and move them around . It 's sort of like objets trouves the art of making a composition withready-made odds and ends , only I 've made the objects . " For the most part , the forces behind Calder 's mobiles are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a mobile without very much worry about how it 's going to move . You trust to luck and the linking . Somehow things seem to work out rather pleasantly . " He is constitutionally unable to comply with requests for works with specific connotations . " I get strange requests to make a mobile that will mean nothing but love , " he says , " hut I do n't know how to do that . " He was once commissioned to do a stabile , preferably suggesting a horse . for a Texas town . When the Texans saw the finished product , they said it did n't look like a horse . " Well , it probably isn'L a horse , " Calder said . The Texans , disappointed and a little confused , did not buy the stabile . Calder 's family has been in art for four generations now . His grandfather created the statue of William Penn which stands atop Philadelphia 's City Hall , and his father is represented in the Metropolitan Museum by a statue of Sandy Calder at the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of his two daughters , Sandra , Sandra is married to Jean Davidson , who is the son of Jo Davidson , the sculptor . Calder 's wife , Louisa , is the grandniece of William and Henry James , but they were writers and do n't count . She has atoned for this background by painting and weaving patterns of her own and Calder 's design . With hindsight , it is posbible to say that Sandy Calder was destined to be a mobilist from infancy . He was making wood and wire figures by the age of live , and one of his childhood creations is an inch-square piece of copper SOARING ART with two of its corners twisted in opposite directions , so that it spins when one holds it between Iwo fingers and blows on it . Calder himself , however , was slow to recognize his inevitable line of work . He was born and raised in Lawnton , Pa. , studied engineering at the Stevens Institute in New Jersey , and then went knocking around the country doing odd jobs . Three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his natural inclinations and started studying at the Art Students League in New York , and drawing for the Police Gazette . Then , in the mid- ' 20 's , he went to Paris to paint . In 1929. on a visit to America , he met and married Louisa James . a quiet , pretty girl from Boston . Calder had become fascinated with circuses while covering one for the Police Gazette , and in Paris he began to make his own , using wire , cork , and clothespins , and making his figures move by means of wires . The circus was extraordinarily ingenious . Riders leaped onto moving horses . A wire strong man lifted a barbell . There was a chariot race , a woolen belly dancer , and a little female aerialist who flew through a paper hoop . The circus quickly delighted the Paris art world , but it did not get uniformly good notices . Thomas Wolfe memorialized it unflatteringly in You Ca n't Go Home Again . In Wolfe 's version , the circus was run by a Mr. Piggy Logan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweater with a Y on it , and kneepads , and it was " unconscionably long , chiefly because Mr. Logan was not able to make it work . " In 1930 a visit to Piet Mondrian 's studio put Calder on the final track to his sculpture in motion . Mondrian 's brightly colored shapes delighted Calder . but he decided they would be even more wonderful if they moved . He went home and started making abstract objects that moved by hand . Next came mechanized mobiles . Finally , Calder settled on natural motion , and he and nature have been collaborating harmoniously ever since . Like his mobiles , Calder 's life today is ingeniously simple . When he moves between Sadie and Roxbury , the only things he takes are a few of his favorite red L.L. Bean shirts . His main interests are nature , talking , food and wine . " I like to drink  --  wine and so on , " Calder said recently . We have a nice wine cellar in Sach ? . We live in the Chateau country , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly troglodytic . The cellar has a cave and a fireplace at one end of it . " The Calder farmhouse at Roxbury , where he lives about half the time , is furnished with rampant informality . The chairs and sofas are comfortable and inelegant , and some of the furniture was made by Calder himself . The living room overflows with artistic clutter , including a number of mobiles , two Le.gers and a MirO , and , over the fireplace , a steer 's skull painted red . Calder found the skull on the grounds . He has also made forks , spoons , strainers , ashtrays from olive-oil cans , and even an electric toaster which has seen infrequent use since it flipped a piece of toast into somebody 's coffee . Just before he left for Sachs last month , Calder showed a visitor around his place at Roxbury . The hard Connecticut countryside sported about a dozen large mobiles and stabiles , some of them weathered to a dull gray , and Calder wandered through the snow , naming them ( " Those are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He paused to straighten a twisted linkage on a large mobile called Tie ' Southern Cross , then walked to the larger of two studios to show his tools and models . In the middle of the jumble was a box containing several tangled pieces of wire sculpture , which had been returned from a Houston show . " That 's the way they treat them , " he muttered , straightening a wire bird . " Messed everything up , all in one carton . Most people , after they 've had them , say the hell with them . " Before lunch Calder drove to the two foundries he uses in Waterbury. 12 miles away . He was greeted heartily at the first foundry by Carmen Segre. the owner , who is building a large , 10-foot-high Calder stabile . A small strip of steel had been welded onto the main stabile in one place , and the visitor remarked that the joint , even before final buffing and painting , was barely visible . " It 's the same with his bill , " Calder joked . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what 's not . " " What 're you going to call this one , Sandy ? " Segre asked . " I du n no , " Calder said . " What do you thin k ? " " Boy , " Segre said , shaking his head . " Three trapezoids and a polygon ? " Calder suggested , in no seriousness . The next foundry was run by a short . wiry man named Liberato Ieronimo , or Chippy for short . When Calder went to Los Angeles to put in place a mobile entitled Hello Girls , he took Chippy and his wife with him . Chippy greeted Calder with a wide grin , and Calder went over to a small stabile which had just been given a primer coat of paint . He looked at it briefly , then marked a short , quarter-moon slice in the wet paint , using a stick of wood , to show a piece that should be cut off . " This is an old one that belongs to the Museum of Modern Art , and they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " so I said I 'd have it made out of heavier metal . Chippy 's going to patch up the old one and I 'll take it . " Driving home , Calder said that Chippy had wanted to see Disneyland during their trip . " I told him everybody there was constructed to five-eighths scale . " Calder said , " and he 'd feel right at home . " Back at the house , the assembled Callers sat down to a lunch of cold meats . Italian bread ( Mrs. Calder makes her own ) , cheese , salad , two kinds of omelet , and quantities of red Italian wine from a large , basketed bottle . Then Calder , the visitor , and the wine bottle retired to the living room , where Calder summed up his artistic credo . " There 's a story about an Irishman in a ditch picking the lice out of his hair when two Englishmen come by , " he said , giving a small mobile in front of him a light whack . ? Hello , Pat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em out ? " No ; Pat says . ' Just takin ' them as they come . ' I just took ' em as they came . "
