Never has the press felt more unpopular at a national political convention than at San Francisco in July , where Republican delegates booed and hissed newsmen from the floor . In contrast , never has the press felt more popular than at Atlantic City last week , where Speaker of the House John McCormack , in opening the Democrats ' conclave , went out of his way to give a cordial welcome to journalists . <P> If this was intended to bring grateful smiles from the press galleries , it got none from the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain . WE DO N'T WANT TO BE LOVED , proclaimed Scripps-Howard in a statement that went to all member papers of the chain . " This love feast at Atlantic City-well , frankly , it 's embarrassing . We will feel more at ease when the Democrats also denounce us again , as they did for so many years . We cherish our memories of the days when the Democrats railed at us as a ' one-party press . ' The late great political reporter Sam Blythe set a stern standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only way for a journalist to look at a politician is down . ' <P> " We do n't expect to be loved . We only insist on being tolerated-and feel more comfortable when those who tolerate us do it reluctantly . " <P> <P> * Chief political correspondent in Washington , 1900-07 , for Joseph Pulitzer 's New York World .
