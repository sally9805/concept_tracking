( See Cover ) <P> To take part in public affairs , to smell the dust and sweat of battle , is surely to stimulate and amplify the historical imagination . <P> - Arthur M. Schlesinger <P> With his horn-rimmed glasses and floppy bow ties , his retreating hairline and advancing waistline , the slightly built man with the professorial air hardly looked the part of the New Frontiersman . But wherever the action was during the thousand days of John F. Kennedy 's Administration , there he was too . <P> Cigar clenched at a jaunty angle between his teeth , manila folder clamped firmly under his arm , Arthur Schlesinger bustled about the corridors of the White House in brisk , choppy steps , now stopping in for a chat with the President , now exchanging gossip with a colleague , now hurrying off to a meeting in the Cabinet Room . Rare was the party that he missed . He turned up regularly at Bobby Kennedy 's Hickory Hill seminars , and once , fully dressed , he slipped or was pushed ( the record does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to know everybody-actresses and artists , poets and politicians-and if Kennedy wanted to meet , say , British Philosopher Sir Isaiah Berlin or Composer Gian Carlo Menotti , Schlesinger could , and did , arrange it . He was the connoisseur on art and literature , movies and martinis , and he served as the Administration 's bridge to the intellectual community . He savored the pleasures and perquisites of power with zest . <P> Actually , Schlesinger was more part of the atmosphere than the substance of the New Frontier . His office , symbolically , was tucked away in a remote corner of the East Wing , near the social secretary and the correspondence section . His specific assignments were few and vague . Though memos cascaded from his typewriter- " beautiful memos , witty , masterfully written memos , " said a colleague , " but often showing bad judgment " - they were frequently ignored . He was only on the periphery of power . But at that , he was closer than most historians have ever been . <P> At First Hand .

After Kennedy 's assassination , the participant reverted to the role of historian , and in 14 months of feverish writing sought to capture on paper the events he had seen at first hand . The result is , by all odds , the best of the 90-or-so Kennedy books that have appeared in the two years since Dallas . It has won Schlesinger critical acclaim and considerable affluence as well . With 175,000 copies in print and a fifth printing set for January , he stands to earn well into six figures . <P> The book is a virtuoso demonstration of the skills that helped make Schlesinger a Pulitzer prizewinner at 28 ( with The Age of Jackson ) and a bestselling author ( with all three volumes of his still incomplete The Age of Roosevelt ) who is also held in high respect by his fellow historians . Those skills include an almost unique combination of encyclopedic knowledge , sharp reporter 's eye , extraordinary facility and a literary style any novelist would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notion of the historian as a scientist . To Schlesinger , the historian is one who " noses around in chaos , like any other writer , " and out of chaos produces a drama that illuminates the facts while
