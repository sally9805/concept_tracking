Pickpocket . French Director Robert Bresson is a Christian cinemascetic who in 29 years has made only seven movies . None of them is a masterpiece , but the best of them ( Diary of a Country Priest , A Man Escaped ) are luminous meditations on the life of man in the sight of God . In Pickpocket , a picture so original in style that it sometimes seems downright peculiar , Bresson propounds a harrowing paradox : that man must sin in order to be saved , that the road to heaven is paved with bad intentions . <P> The plot is a palingenesis of Dostoevsky 's Crime and Punishment . Like Raskolnikov , the hero ( Martin La Salle ) is a penniless student with Nietzschean notions about crime : " Some men are stronger and more talented than others and have the right to break the law . Their crimes revitalize society . " Such thoughts impelled Raskolnikov to murder ; they inspire Michel to pick pockets . The crimes differ in seriousness , but not in spiritual effect . In both cases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilt , despair , contrition , atonement , love . <P> As the story ends , Michel reaches through the bars that define his freedom and wonderingly touches the young woman he now knows he loves . " What a strange and terrible way I had to travel , " he says in a trembling voice , " to find you . " <P> The moment is exquisitely interpreted and profoundly affecting , but the rest of the film is cold . However , the chill is deliberate . It counterfeits the frigid region of unbeing inhabited by the hero . It forces the spectator to see the hero 's life from an infinite distance , with an infinite impersonality . The experience is uncanny . It makes the moviegoer feel almost like a god .
