Though Africa 's hot-eyed nationalists wear European suits and talk knowingly of constitutional provisions and voting qualifications , they are well aware that many African tribesmen are still more impressed with black magic than political oratory . Last week an official pamphlet issued by the Southern Rhodesian government reported that some black leaders , unable to fire up their loyal constituents in the cause of black nationalism , have tried to fan antiwhite feeling by more primitive means . <P> They spread a story that a gang of whites with occult powers was kidnaping native men and women and turning them into pigs to feed the inhabitants of a land called Burumatare . Tribesmen were told that the whites roam the countryside with a machine that looks like a camera but which actually makes an indelible mark on the bodies of potential victims . Later a lorry arrives . When its horn blows , all those marked will be irresistibly drawn toward it and abducted , later to be injected with a solution that transforms them immediately into swine . " We must believe that the Europeans have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " because only Africans have fallen before its evil . " <P> Last week , on a British-owned farm , 200 workers-victims of the Burumatare syndrome-quit work in terror , refused to return to their jobs in spite of the owner 's attempts to reassure them . " Our hearts are different to yours , master , " they said . At the suggestion of his African foreman , the farmer painted 200 rubber bands white and slipped one on the wrist of each laborer . Only then did the local natives finally return to work , confident in the power of the white master 's juju magic .
