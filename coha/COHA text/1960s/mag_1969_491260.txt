Mail call in Kunming , China , one day in 1943 brought 30-year-old Lt. Joseph Passantino a letter from Chicago , where he did n't know anybody . Passantino , now a New York commercial printer , reconstructs the letter roughly as follows : " My son Barney writes me that you and he have become great buddies in China , so I imagine you already know how impulsive and enthusiastic he can be . Sometimes he becomes so excited he gets himself into trouble . . As his father , could i ask you to keep an eye on him , and be like a big brother to him ? ... " Passantino was already trying . He and his friend Barney , who was 20 , each commanded a unit of a dozen or so photographers : together the units made up the 164th Signal Photo Co . The job was to take pictures of captured enemy equipment and personnel , of the training of new soldiers for Chiang Kai-shek , of terrain that might be fought over , and of combat in the neighborhood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal use by the Army . They were not news pictures . " But Barney was terrifically impatient with that Army brass , " Passantino says , " and with that GI thing that dawdled and procrastinated . And the Chinese army did n't move for Barney the way he thought it ought to move . General Stilwell got thrown out of China for the same reason Barney would have been if he 'd been big enough . He would tell anybody off . I 'd say , ' Barney , now , wait a minute . Hold it . You 're in the Army ; it does n't work that way . ' " Danger did n't faze him , " Passantino recalls . " He was far ahead of the average guy you would meet in the Army , mentally , and he was a little dynamo , but with all of that he was n't impressive . He does n't look you straight in the eye , he 's got that nervous laugh , and his voice trails off . Just a little while ago we had him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine 1 thought he might want to do some business with . My friends could n't believe that was Barney Rosset , the owner of Grove Press .. . " Though in sales volume it ranks around the middle of 100 or so American book publishers , Barney Rosset 's Grove Press is today the most talked-about enterprise of its kind , especially among the literate young . " The kids in college who think they 'd like to be in publishing all want to work for Grove , " says William Callahan , who was executive vice president of Dell Publishing when Dell distributed Russet 's commercially promising paperbacks . " It has the same sort of standing Alfred Knopf had forty years ago . " Knopf , who takes pride in the dozen or so Nobel Prize winners his house has published , would not be pleased by the comparison land neither , for that matter , would Rosset ) , but Callahan is probably right . Even within the publishing establishment , Rosset does not completely lack admirers . " When the history of publishing is written , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have a place in it . He 's bright . He takes a lot of risks that look frivolous to many people . but there 's a serious radical impulse behind them all . He 's altered the climate of publishing to everybody 's advantage . Less than ten years ago it would have been inconceivable that anybody could publish Genet in this country , and now Our Lady of the Flowers is in Modern Library , and Barney 's done it . " The man for whom history will find a place is slight , lean and alert , with sandy hair going gray and long sideburns , wearing very thick horn-rimmed glasses , carelessly dressed , and obviously on the run even when sitting . He operates his publishing house under three logos : hard-cover books with the name Grove Press , bookstore-priced paperbacks with the name Evergreen , and drugstore-priced paperbacks with the name Black Cat . All three lists are a hodgepodge of serious literature , significant hooks in sociology and psychology , and sex ranging from squishy to the edge of hard-core pornography . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them well underground , though some have at least a nostril visible on the surface . Grove first came to prominence before the public and the booksellers in 1959 , with the publication of the unexpurgated Lady Chatterley 's Laver , and the house is probably best known for the indiscriminate mess of Henry Miller , Victorian wet dreams , Genet , Starr of 0 , and the scatological Burroughs , Frank Harris and Marquis de Sade that appear under its imprints  --  plus the avant-garde poetry , the wide variety of short . fiction , the op art and hot photography and sadomasochistic comic strips that make up the monthly magazine Evergreen Review , But before Lady Chatterley , a Grove book had been reviewed on the front page of The New York Times Book Rericit  --  a first modern American publication of Giovanni Verga 's The House hy the Medlar Tree , a classic of the Italian verisma Tradition that has shown greater staying power than either French or American realism . There had been a dozen volumes of contemporary American poetry , a notch-admired introdm rion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paperback art hooks with first-class color plates , presenting the major figures of the American 20th century . On the list before Lath ' Chatterley were three volumes of Brecht , Iwo each of lonesco and Brendan Behan , and eight of Samuel Beckett , who in the process of publication by Grove became Rosset 's friend . ( " Barney and I go to the tennis matches , " Beckett said not long ago . " We play games , and we talk politics . We do n't talk literature . I do n't talk literature much with nobrody . It 's bad enough to have to write these books without talking about them too . " ) Rosset published Waiting for Gadot two years before the play opened . Marilynn Meeker , a quiet , serious , incredibly hardworking editor who has been with Grove since 1953 , was miscast into the house 's sales operation in the New York area at the time Godot was published , and she remembers wandering the streets with the slim volume in her hand , lonely as a cloud , unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who 's going to spend five dollars for that . ' ' ' ' ' In its first year . Godot sold a grand total of 700 copies ; today , the sales in paperback tat $1.75 ) are approaching half a million . The first book Rosset ever published was a reprint of Henry James 's The Golden Bowl in 1952 . He had recently bought the three-title inventory of the tiny Grove Press ( named for Grove Street in Greenwich Village ) from its young founders , and had personally carted all the books to his top-floor apartment in an old walk-up . They were stacked in his living room . and whenever an order came in , he would wrap the books and take them to the post office in a laundry cart . Having become a publisher , he went to Columbia and took a course in publishing , and while there he met Donald Allen , who had got hooked by Japanese literature while he was a Navy officer . Allen rented the apartment next door and became Grove 's first editor ( he is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I bought the rights to The Golden Bowl from Scribner 's , " Rosset recalls , " Whitney Darrow , who was a personage , came up to see who we were . He walked upstairs and came in , and it was quite an experience for him . I did n't think it was so funny then as I do now : - Nobody who knew Rosset really believed he had found his vocation : It seemed much more likely that he had found another toy . George Orwell once wrote of a friend who liked to say that he knew he was a genius long before he knew what he was a genius at ; Rosset was one of those . Born in Chicago in 1922 , he was the adored and feared only child of an Irish mother and a Jewish father , a banker who had made his first million before he was 21 , lost it , and then made several more .

Young Barney was sent to Francis Parker , perhaps the fiat hest-out of the progressive schools of the 1930 's . It became , and in many ways still 6 ? the center of his existence , the source of what Jason Epstein calls " his old-fashioned avanteardism . " Rosset himself says , " You 've got to understand that nothing has changed me since I 0 high school . " Rosset 's first wife . the painter Joan Mitchell . a handsome , tough-minded lady with a big t dent and fierce dedication to it , began 9oing out with him when they were both at Parker . " He ran his class , " she recalls . " Everybody looked up to him . He had a car before any ' ne else had a car , but that was n't it . He was shy and he did n't la I X well . and he became class president ; and he was a little guy and skinny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star . That 's pretty good , you know . " Swarthmore , Chicago and U.C.L.A. in rapid succession took a crick at changing Barney after he left Parker , and all give up . Then young Rosset , having breathed the last of a fiery pacifism when Hitler attacked Russia ; joined the Army , went off the top of the classification test , and became a Signal Corps officer . As Passantino observed , the Army did n't change him , either . He loved China , but he learned no Chinese , The war over , Rosser returned to the University of Chicago ( " they could n't keep me out  --  I 'd never failed any courses ; I had a complete incomplete , never took any exams " ) and bought an airplane . Miss Mitchell remembers going up with him and hearing him say , as they lazily circled the lake shore , " I 've forgotten how to land this damned thing . " Passantino remembers saying , " ' Barney , why do you want a plane ? ' He said , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you look down on all Chicago . ' I said , ' Barney , what the hell good is that ? ' The next year he told me I 'd been right . " Presently Rosset and Miss Mitchell went off to live together , in New York , to the horror of her parents , who were Chicago society , and Russet decided to make a movie . This was Strange Victory , a semidocumentary about race relations in the United States ; it opened in 1948 , a decade ahead of its time in topic and a decade behind in treatment . ( " Think hack  --  was there ever a hope that flared high.:1r than that hope of 111/ ( ISL011117er 1945 ? . , . Nobody knows where that victory is : Lost , strayed or stolen , it is n't here , . . , " with endless pictures of babies of various colors in hospital nurseries ...

Rosset Jr . ) About a quarter of a million dollars of the Rosset family fortune disappeared in this picture . " I lost a hundred percent , " Rosset said recently . " More than that , you ca n't do . " Shortly after the failure of the film , Miss Mitchell , by then legally Mrs. Ross &; received a fellowship to work in France , arid her husband tagged along . For reasons Rosset could never figure out , they lived a while in Paris in a room without plumbing ( " she convinced me we had to save money ; 1 ca n't remember why " ) . Then they went south to ContLnued on page 72 Provence , where Miss Mitchell painted and Rosso vegetated in the-or ) trying to write a novel , but actually just lounging about . coming alive to do the cooking at night .

Miss Mitchell had come to France basically a representational painter ; she left France an abstract expressionist . " I 'd thought all art had to be socially useful , " Rosset says . " Down there in Provence , I was actually watching the breakup of the forms . III have any taste today , or any emotion about art , and if the Grove book covers show any consistency , it 's all thanks to Joan. ? ' Rosset loved France , but he learned no French . On their return to America , the Rossets began summering on eastern Long Island with the de Koonings and Pollocks and Klines . Rosset picked up at early ' 50 's prices some paintings he sold a few years ago on the grounds that he was scared to have anything worth that much hanging on his wall . He was still , in effect , doing nothing . He tried to find a place for himself in Truman 's Point Four program , and with the American Association for the United Nations , but it all came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and did so , alone . Rosset likes to say of their divorce that " all she wanted was her own name back  --  she did n't want anything from me . " " That shows you what a gentleman Barney is , " says Miss Mitchell . " The fact of the matter is that he divorced me , but he would n't want to say that . " And then , quite suddenly , because Miss Mitchell knew a young man who had a half-interest in an almost dormant publishing house , young Barney was a publisher . Grove stumbled along slowly for its first three or four years ; then Rosset and his father ( who was , after all , payi ng the bills ) agreed that if you were going to be in publishing , you had to have a list of books , so you could allocate overhead to a lot of items , hire salesmen , etc . There was little chance of a new firm 's picking up any quantity of publishable original material , so Rosset went off to London and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were very nice , " Rosset says , " even the big ones  --  Faber &; Faber offered me Justine ( the first hook in Lawrence Durrell 's Alexandria series , which sold hugely ) , and I turned it down because I did n't like it . " In Paris Rosset made contact with JerOme Lindon , whose Editions de Minuit , founded as part of the Resistance movement , had become the leading house of the nouvelle vague . Though they can communicate only with difficulty ( Lindon , who had an American grandfather , speaks no English , and Rosset can only struggle inventively in French ) , they set up parallel operations . Arming the authors Rosset has taken from Lindon are Ikekett , Marguerite Duras and Alain Robbc-Grillei . " Grove is ' , merit:an publisher closest to oui ? i Lindon said the other day in his little office in an alley off St.-Germain-des-Pres . " And I like Barney because he is a very line man . I always say , when the Americans arc intelligent , they are very intelligent . Barney has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is extraordinarily young , and he has a taste for risk  --  literary risk , risk of good taste , political risk . There is one difference in situation  --  it seems to me that in the United States erotic publications are more important than they are here . Myself , I have never published a book that has taken me to the Palais de Justice ; I am a Puritan . " Rosset 's Barbarella comic strip ( which he advertised as " banned in France " ) did not come from Lindon . As the Grove list grew , the floors in Rosset 's walk-up began to buckle under the inventory , and he took office space in a second-floor loft over a dry-goods store at 795 Broadway . He needed a bookkeeper , which is why he hired Marilynn Meeker , whose ambitions were literary though she had been involved with ledgers in a previ oils job . And he needed somebody to keep an eye on the business , for which purpose one day in lunch he hired Howard 1 urner , who had been his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend . Joe Passantino managed much of the production and printing work , on a contract . book-by-hook basis . Another employee was a German girl , Hannelore Eckert who presently became Mrs. Rosset . Russet 's son Peter , now 13 , was born to this marriage . Two years after Barney became a publisher his father died , and Barney 's share of the estate went into Grove Press . " Barney has a thing about money , " says Jason Epstein . " He does n't like it . " Turner having returned to making films , Rosset in 1956 hired Fred Jordan , a British-educated Viennese refugee , to handle sales and promotion and mind the store while the boss went off to Europe . Rosset returned with an enormous publishing program . From a happy family of four employees and a list of about 30 titles in print at the beginning of 1956 , Grove went to an office of 30 employees and the publication of 100 titles a year , nearly all of them in paperback under the Evergreen name . And then came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having arrived in publishing until you 've had a best seller , " says Fred Jordan . " Lady Chatterley was our best seller . " It was a lot more than that . The hook made Grove a big-time legal client as well as a big-time publisher . Russet turned it over to a tennis companion , Charles Rembar , a darkly handsome literary lawyer . " There had already been rumblings from the Post Office when Barney talked to me , " Rembar said the other day . " And then everything happened so fast there was no time to prepare . But we wanted it fast  --  I felt that if there was a fat federal case going , the local prosecutors would lay back . and they did . " The judicial officer appointed by the Post Office referred the matter up to the Postmaster General without recommendation ; but this dignitary was then Mr. Arthur Summerfield , the Michigan car dealer . and he had no hesitation about barring Lady Chatter-ley from the mails . " In these cases . traditionally . the defense is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " I did n't want to take that position . " Expanding some language in a 1957 Supreme Court decision , Rembar developed what later became known as the social-value test . " It was a chancs way to approach the case , " he says . " and you 've got to hand it to Rosset . He did n't want to win this case on the grounds that the Post Office Department had violated the Administrative Procedure Act  --  he wanted to win it on the grounds that the hook was worth publishing . And we did . " Lady Chatterley all by herself almost doubled Grove 's volume . But it did Rosset some damage , too  --  it gave him a wholly misleading notion of the costs of defending pornography actions . Two years later , 60 separate state and local prosecutions were brought against Grove 's edition of Henry Miller 's long-banned Tropic of Cane r after the Post Office decided to leave it alone . Because publishers normally warrant that they will hold booksellers harmless for selling their wares , Grove had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money from Grove 's inflated organization  --  it 's one thing to have everybody pitch in at 5:30 or on Saturday and take care of the week 's undone tasks when there are four employees , and something quite different when there are 30 in the office and nobody knows what 's undone  --  the costs of defending the booksellers drove Rosset perilously near the wall . ( Later , when he published Miller 's Tropic of Capricorn . he specifically and publicly disavowed all responsibility for defending those who sold it . ) He peddled Grove Press all over New York and could n't sell it : the banks would n't lend him money ; and he remained afloat , finally , only through the doubtful courtesy of the moneylenders . Rosset took one more crack at avoiding the commercial responsibilities of a publishing house : Late in 1962 he brought in Charles RemNo to he president of Grove . " We coordinated line as lawyer and client . " Rembar says today , " but as business partners we were terrible . The theory s as that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ! Oust did n't work . He would say , ' Let 's publish X book . ' I 'd say , ' It 's going to get us into litigation and we 've got enough litigation . ' He would say , ' But it 's a good hook , ' and I 'd say. , ' But it 's a lousy book .. My connection with the business was short term . " Though the house now has nine editors , Rosset still has not relinquished to anybody the actual decision to publish something under a Grove imprint . " What integrity you can discern in the list . " says Fred Jordan , " is Rosset 's personality . " Richard Seaver. managing editor since 1959 , keeps up with French publishers , and Jordan follows the Germans ( much of Grove 's volume still is in foreign authors ) , but in English-language material , Rosset is his own first reader . " My important talent , " he says , " is rejecting things quickly everyone else gets drawn into reading them . The one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of months , the telephone calls start arriving  --  what happened to my manuscript ? ? and nobody can give an answer . " After a recent summer vacation Rosset , Seaver , Jordan and Marilynn Meeker sat around a conference table and in one morning threw back 400 manuscripts on the grounds that the first page of each was no good . Sex books are on the Grove list because Rosset likes sex hooks ( both for their own sake and because they offend middle-class squares ) . Sex alone , however , is by no means a sufficient recommendation to sell Grove a book . though many authors think otherwise ( " Sometimes you look at a manuscript , " says Miss Meeker , " and you know the author thought . ' Aha ! They 'll publish this ! ' " ) . In any event , Grove is now a going concern that can count on its share of the publishing luck . When Doubleday decided not to risk the Black Muslim nuisance that might follow publication of the Malcolm X Autobiography , Grove was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Brooklyn came to Grove because it seemed the right house ; Game. , People Play , a set of psychological parlor tricks , which staved on the best-seller lists longer than any other nonfiction book in the last decade , was a byproduct of Rosset 's prior publication of its author 's more serious efforts . Today Rosset has almost 150 employees , and a computer to bollix the subscription lists of Evergreen Rerieur and the billing for the Evergreen ( " Join the Underground " ) Book Club . The company is still something less than a model for business schools  --  books appear on , and disappear from , lists virtually without warning to salesmen ; high-priced people type their own letters while low-priced people give themselves manicures ; and not long ago when Rosset 's invaluable secretaryassistant went ' iii vacation , his outei ollice was occupied for live long and terrifying weeks by a young lady from Germany who spoke no English ( and Russet speaks no German ) . But the days are gone when Rosso tried to distribute his books through a fleet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and required his editors to buy paper , choose type faces , and set production schedules and see books through the press because he fill that product ion managers do not earn their keep . Now ( irove has conventional warehousing and a conventional production department . The confusion of the loft at 795 Broadway , with its low partitions and informal " It's-forYOU-Fred " telephone system , has given way to a neat , white five-story building on University Place , with different functions on different floors and a garden-variety switchboard . Des- my . having marked young Rosset as a businessman while he was in his cradle . has finally caught up with him , and for six consecutive years the house has made money . Indeed , what worries Rosset 's friends ( and sometimes his employees ) is that he may lose interest in Grove now that the house is prospering . An ominous rumbling came when Rosset revived his long-dormant drive toward film producing . " Film is the natural direction in a lot of contemporary writers . " he explained , " and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissioned full-length scripts from RubbeGrillet and Marguerite Duras , and one-act scripts from Pinter , lonesco and Beckett . He actually produced the Beckett script ( which had no dialogue ) . Aith Buster Keaton in the leading role , and had it shown in New York in 1965. under the stark title Film , as part of the Lincoln Center Film Festival . But the others have lain fallow . In 1966 , however . Rosset returned to the movie world from another end : as a distributor , using again the name Evergreen . He bought a large collection of " experimental " films that had been showing on a club basis ( members only ) under the name Cinema 16 , and undertook to arrange theater bookings for Titicut Follies , a chilling documentary about the horrors of l'fe in a Massachusetts public insane asylum . The state sued to prohibit showings of the film , and won ( mostly on grounds that the inmates were recognizable , violating a privacy the institution was bound to protect ) . " We 've been in court thirteen or fourteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've lost every time . " Titieur Follies is being distributed to universities for showing on campus ? " our assumption , which may be false . is that the state wo n't interfere at universities " ? and is gradually paying back some of its costs , though the total receipts to date arc still less than the legal fees Grove paid to defend the theater bookings . The most specifically Evergreen feature-length film currently on display is The Queen , the tale of a beauty contest among male homosexuals in drag , which Rosset helped to finance and produce . He is also distributing Godard 's Weekend , a horror story ( new style ) about modern France . and a Norman Mailer extravaganza called Beyond the Law . Then there is I Am Curious ? Yellow , a Swedish film that was seized by customs as obscene before Rosset could show it . " No sooner do we touch something . " Rosset says , " than it 's in court . " In late November . however , a Federal Court of Appeals reversed a jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future films . Rosset has bought a 154-seat theater on West llth Street in the tourist part of Greenwich Village . The same building also houses The Black Circle . a har Rosset has had decorated entirely in black , chrome and mirrors . " We 've given it the 1930 's Warner Brothers look . " Rosset says . " very moderne. - He adds wistfully , " I always wanted to run a bar ... . " In short . Rosset at 46 is still doing things simply because he wants to do them : He is , in all senses of an abused word , an amateur . He is undisciplined on purpose . He has an intensely quixotic view of the world : When Cuban exiles threw a grenade through a Grove Press window one weekend in July  --  to protest the publication of Che Guevara 's diary  --  Rosset told The New York Times that he was personally a revolutionary but did not approve of people 's throwing grenades through windows . Rosset 's quixotic strain , coupled with his congenital amateurism , should have buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a unique combination of factors  --  the large margin provided by his lather 's estate . an intelligence that repeatedly saves him from his own worst follies. and the odd circumstance that he is an unusually likable human being . Rosset 's home base at this writing is an elaborated Quonset but in East Hampton , out toward the end of Long Island a hundred miles from New York . The sand has been landscaped . two outbuildings have been turned into quarters for eight guests ( one of them held about 40 for an exciting weekend last July , when Norman Mailer turned tip with his do-it-yourself crew of film makers ) , a rather Floridian swimming pool has been added , and there is a tennis court that dries even before the rain stops . Rosset plays a fierce two-handed game , switching the racket to give himself a forehand wherever the ball comes . ( He remembers going out for freshman tennis at Swarthmore. and the coach 's saying , " Rosset , if you want to learn how to play tennis , I 'll teach you ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the court . " ) Rosset 's third wife , Cristina  --  a slight , pretty dancer who was less than half his age when they were married four years ago  --  fits easily and quietly into his surroundings . Rosset 's friends give her credit for calming him and giving him some perspective on himself . Still . he continues to get himself into situations that would he quite impossible for other people . For example . the Rossets have no place to live in New York , because Barney for years had admired a vacant loft building across the street from their house . in the lower part of Greenwich Village . When the birth of his daughter Tansey threatened to deprive the house of its guest room , Rosset bought the old loft building to he reconditioned into a home . Then he sold his house , expecting the loft alterations to be accomplished quickly and easily . Instead , he said the other day , " We are still having great trouble getting a design we like that it is possible to pay for . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no great talent is necessary to make fun of it , or to demonstrate that Rosset 's luxurious life in East Hampton is about the same life he would he leading if he had simply put his inheritance into mutual funds . Nevertheless , the fact remains that he has done something to change the world , like it or not , and he has done it his own way . " You have to remember , " says Fred Jordan , " ' that Barney is a product of the period when kids were very conscious of phoniness . Barney does n't want to he a phony . "
