The Polka Saloon . Sunset . Suddenly the sheriff rises from the faro table and snarls at an amateur gunslinger : " Ragazzo , e l'whisky che lavora Boy , your whisky is too strong . " His angry Italian rings strangely in that watering place of the American frontier . His opponent is fast on the draw , but not fast enough : on the stairway appears a girl in fringed jerkin and boots , firing from the hip . The revolver spins out of the gunslinger 's hand . The girl strides coolly across the bar . " Vi do la buona sera , sceriffo " she says to the sheriff . <P> The Metropolitan Opera season has not opened on a gaudier note since Maria Jeritza made her entrance as the stripteasing heroine of Thais in 1923 . The cowgirl with the red braided hair was Soprano Leontyne Price ( TIME cover , March 10 ) , and the opera that rang up last week 's curtain was La Fanciulla del West , or The Girl of the Golden West , by that old roughrider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fanciulla is often regarded as an embarrassing mistake , and the Met has not staged it in 30 years . But last week 's production was more than good enough to remind the audience that even in horse opera there is more than one tune to sing from the horse . <P> Not for Singers . Puccini saw David Belasco 's The Girl of the Golden West in New York in 1907 , promptly announced that " I shall write the music and we shall have the American opera ... I have never been West , but I have read so much about it that I know it thoroughly . " Puccini , of course , knew no more about the American West than he knew about Japan when he wrote Madama Butterfly . But operagoers in 1910 , when Fanciulla had its premiere at the Met , were no fussier than televiewers are today : with Caruso and Emmy Destinn in the leads , the premiere tied up traffic for hours near the opera house . The delighted Puccini celebrated by buying a $3,000 speedboat and naming it the Minnie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the speedboat had a collision on an Italian lake and almost sank ; the opera disappeared from the Met 's repertory . <P> One reason that Fanciulla failed to catch on permanently is that it was not truly a singer 's opera : moving in the direction of Turandot , Puccini at the time was experimenting with more complex harmonies , increasing the importance of the orchestra and giving the singers fewer of the swooning set pieces that illuminated works like Boheme . And although the libretto is no more farfetched than that of many another opera , it falls strangely on American ears attuned to Hollywood and TV westerns .
