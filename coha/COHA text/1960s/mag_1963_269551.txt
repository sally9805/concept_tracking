In Canada , where superlatives are especially prized because there are so few of them , the favorite word of Montreal 's Aluminium Limited is " biggest . " Aluminium* prides itself on having the world 's biggest aluminum smelter , the biggest private hydroelectric project , and the biggest bauxite production . Last week , at its annual meeting , Aluminium announced the best superlative of them all : in 1962 it comfortably maintained its lead as the world 's largest primary aluminum producer . As sales rose 8% to a record $515 million , and profits jumped 24% to $34 million . Aluminium poured 790,000 tons of aluminum around the world v. 700,000 by the U.S. 's Alcoa , its fiercest competitor . <P> Though all this greatly pleases Canadians , who are happy to see the Yanks second best in something . Aluminium is not so much a Canadian company as a truly international one . Its founders came from Pittsburgh , its plants span 30 countries from Japan to Africa , and 85% of its sales are made in more than 100 foreign nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvard-educated ( ' 38 ) U.S. citizen : " Canada can use only 15% of our output . We have to sell the rest of it to the world . " <P> Low Costs . Aluminium was created largely by Davis ' imaginative uncle , the late Arthur Vining Davis , longtime chief of the Aluminum Company of America . Partly to satisfy U.S. trustbusters , Alcoa in 1928 tied its foreign branches into a single package and spun them off as Aluminium . Since 1951 , when a federal court ordered Alcoa to sell off the last of its stock holdings , Alcoa 's prime interest in Aluminium has been to block it from winning more of the U.S. market , which is Aluminium 's No.1 customer . <P> Aluminium comfortably skims tariff barriers because it is a low-cost producer , benefiting from Canada 's lower-wage labor , devalued dollar and abundance of cheap electric power . Harnessing the remote Saguenay River , Aluminium cut into the trackless wilds of northern Quebec to build the dams that now power the smelter at Arvida ( a contraction of Arthur Vining Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Columbia , it carved a ten-mile tunnel into a mountain , created a waterfall 16 times as high as Niagara Falls and built a smelter with an awesome annual capacity of 300,000 tons . <P> New Process . Aluminium uses its selling power deftly abroad , lest it court higher tariffs . Instead of pushing aggressively , its smoothly multilingual salesmen overseas seek to sell ingots to local fabricators-which are often Aluminium subsidiaries with local shareholders , directors and managers . " We ca n't run our foreign operating companies from Montreal , " says President Davis , who jets around the world two or three times a year to help stitch together the loose empire . <P> Knowing that it must export to survive , Aluminium is now experimenting with a radically new process that could make it even more competitive . Scheduled to start producing next year at Arvida is a new . plant designed to produce aluminum directly from bauxite , without first converting it into saltlike alumina . If successful , that process alone would cut production costs by 25% . <P> *Which adds a British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al-you-m/H-ee-um.
