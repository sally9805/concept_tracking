THE OFFAL KIND a story by Ayi Kwei Armah When she went away from her people she was still very young . She did not know the lady who came to take her away . but her mother knew her . They had sat talking all night about her . She was going to be the lady 's household help , and if she was good and learned everything there was to learn , she would perhaps be a lady herself one day , perhaps . They had had to walk the few miles to the road before they could get on a lorry that would take them into the town . They were three : her mother , the lady , and herself . She was used to walking ; every day she had gone to the stream to fetch water for the family , and the stream was down farther than this road , in the other direction . The lady tired very easily , and her own sweat made her angry , so that she stopped talking long before they got onto the road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front , so they had to wait for another lorry . It was hot , and the girl was thankful when at last one driver took them . Sitting crushed between older people in the middle of the lorry . she had seen nothing of the green countryside flowing past the lorry . Her mother said it would have made her dizzy . The first day after they arrived in the town was a good day . The girl 's mother prepared to go back to the village alone . She had broughtalong a lot of food , and the lady was very liberal with it , to her own immense satisfaction . The second day , with her mother gone , the girl was given more work and a little less food . Now she had to eat alone , apart from the lady and her two children . Afterwards she washed all the dishes , bringing water from the public pipe . With the passage of days her work increased , until she came to understand , without having to be told , that under normal circumstances she should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was eating less and less now , so that eventually her mealtimes produced only a slight appeasement of the hunger that was always with her now . And the less the lady gave her to eat , the more often she told her , " Food costs money here . Do n't waste it . " The girl would smile timidly , look down , and proceed with her work . Every day , when she went to the market to buy food , she would watch the mammies  --  the market women . To herself , very secretly , she imagined she was one of the mammies , selling her own things with a smile , a song , or a frown if she pleased ; growing fatter and fatter with everlasting contentment ; able to eat whatever her appetite demanded , to wear rustly new clothes frequently , and to work or rest whenever she felt like it . She had heard her mother say she was going to have things to sell , and she waited SO . THE OFFAL KIND eagerly for the day when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praised her for same work she had done , and she felt she could safely ask about things to sell : but her question produced a violent change in the lady . Her eyes flashed angrily , and she shouted , " What do you think I am , your servant ? " The girl 's voice softened to a whine . " Please , I beg your pardon . " " Well , do n't question me again . " The gap between the lady and the girl , already wide , grew wider . Work had drugged the girl so that she did not have enough energy even to resent it , and even her enforced silence meant to her a measure of safety ; she knew , at least , that she was not offending anyone by talking . Though she could not ask questions aloud , she could still think of the market women , watch them , and still wish she could be like them , rich and free . But when would the lady let her buy and sell things ? When would the lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all it was to be only a beginning . Something better . would follow if only she did this well . She was going to sell atadwe , tiger nuts . She would work the whole day , and then at night , when the lady and her husband and her children were in bed , she would go out to the Bus Stop , under the electric street light , and sell the tiger nuts . The first few days were lonely , and , sitting there under the pale light of the lamp , she had longed for sleep ; but soon people started buying from her . The children of the neighborhood came to beg for the nuts , and when she said she could not give them any , they remained to tease her . When they were dune teasing they would sit around her and tell stories . At times they were unruly , and would dip their hands into the basin and scoop up a handful of nuts ; then running wildly away from her , they would prepare for another swoop . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the girl a thief and a wastrel . That was the end of the tiger nuts . The hunger grew . The jobs increased so that the girl now had to wake very early and sleep very late , except for the few times when her mother came to ask how she was doing . Then the lady would say how all was fine in her household . and how she had taught the girl to do this and that , and how she sometimes mishehaved but was generally not too bad . At such times her mother used to ask her , not out of doubt , but of joy and enthusiasm , " Is that true , Araba , is that true ? " She could only look down at her feet and nod , " Yes , my mother , it is true . " And the inner hurtshe felt at the lie disappeared when she thought of the tremendous outer hurt she would suffer if she told the truth . Tiger nuts were out now , their season gone . The lady complained more often now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Africa Company stores where everybody bought imported things . They brought back a big box full of Cabin biscuits and Players , The lady said she could sell the biscuits on the beaches , where the Ewe fishermen worked . A carton of biscuits would make exactly one shilling profit , the cigarettes only fivepence a tin . " So sell quickly , " the lady said , " and do n't go wasting anything . Look out for thieves . Ewes steal like monkeys . " In the first weeks she sold a carton a day , because the fishing season was at its height , and the beaches swarmed with people fishing , pulling the rope , haggling , buying , selling , and people at play . The rains make everything angry in the town . In the country the rain falls first on the thick canopy of trees , losing its destructive force . Slowly , it loads the leaves and branches , and when they are full and heavy it slides down or drops lazily , making hardly any noise on the soft leaf-covered humus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ground is dusty and hard , and the violent rain hits it with a large , repetitive report , tearing the remaining bits of hard soil and exposing the smooth pebbles just below . The sea itself is affected . It swells and moves nearer ; the waves begin farther out and are bigger and louder when they break . All the sand is wet with the now dirty seawater . The fishermen pull their canoes off the shore , onto the land itself , and they themselves travel back to their tribal lands , to wait until a better season comes . The rainy season was in the air , though as yet it had not broken . Only a few fishing crews were left , and Araba had to walk far to get to them . The men were busy struggling with their ropes , and did not take time off to buy anything . The girl fell tired . first novel , " The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born , " was published in 1968 by Houghton Mifflin . He was educated in his native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been a scriptwriter and teacher in Ghana and a translator-editor on the staff of " Jenne Afrigne " in Paris . within her twisted itself into a knot of pain , then vanished , and came again . She thought of the biscuits , but then the old fear came ; she must not eat any of the biscuits . The pain came again . and this time it did not go away . She picked up one of the biscuits . Unthinkingly , she ate it slowly . Then she ate two more . The pain was off now , but the emptiness rose from her stomach to her mouth . She ate three more of the biscuits . The net was in now , and from nowhere a little crowd came and surrounded the fishermen . Four little boys detached themselves and came toward the girl . They hovered around her . " You want to buy some ? " she asked . They nodded . " Where 's your money ? " " We 'll give you our fish . " " I ca n't take fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " No . " The boys moved off , laughing together . They joined the fishing crew , and busied themselves pulling the last length of rope that would bring in the big bag-net . Faster and faster the rhythm of the fishermen 's song went . The black net appeared now and then out of Lhe heavy surf , and the seagulls came nearer the men . The men 's singing broke into hoarse shouts , and they pushed the little boys out of the way . The boys came hack to Arabs . One of them stepped forward . " You still do n't want our fish ? " Araba hesitated . The boy went on . " You can sell it for a lot of money once you get hack into town . " The girl was quiet for a moment ; then she said , " 0 I know . You wo n't get any fish . The fishermen do n't know you . I saw them push you away . " At this all the boys laughed . and Araba felt foolish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken to Araba , came forward and said to her , " You do n't believe us . I am going to get my fish . Come and see for yourself . " The girl looked at the carton of biscuits . " I ca n't leave them here , " she said . " The sea will wet them if you come with them . The others will take care of them . " The girl looked fearfully at the three boys , but they were serious . " All right , " she said to the fourth , " let 's go . You 'll give me a lot , wo n't you ? " The two moved down toward the surf . Araba glanced hack from time to time to make sure the three boys were still there . They smiled whitely and waved to her . Over the deafening noises of the men , the floundering fish , and the seagulls circling low over the bag-net , the boy shouted harsh staccato phrases to Araba . " I ama story by Ayi Kwei Armalt 81 looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaches him . Ah , there he is . The other side . Follow me . " Excitedly , the girl ran after the boy , stumbling awkwardly in the wet sand . She saw the boy move towards a very tall man , and she straightened herself to stop . But the boy did not go to the man . He ran past him , and vanished beyond the coconut trees . Panic-stricken , the girl ran back toward the three boys and her hiscuits . They were gone , She grew used to such severe beatings . She felt little pain now that she was resigned to them and could relax . But the hunger she could not bear . She was growing up , and resentment was setting in . She began to buy things in the market . She knew the women from whom she always bought her food , and they now gave her a little extra if she haggled pleasantly enough . This way she pared off a few pennies each day , and bought herself something to eat . Then the lady found out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl came back from the market that day . She let her put down her load and then attacked her , using the broom as a whip . " You ate in the market today ! " the lady screamed . The broom frightened the girl . She raised her arms to protect her face . A feeble " No " escaped her . Her voice reverted to a whine . " Please , not the broom , " she pleaded . The blows fell harder . " Tell the truth ! " the lady shouted . " Esi saw you . Shall T call her ? " When the girl admitted the offense the whipping did not stop . From the look in the lady 's eyes , the girl knew begging would do her no good . When she ran nut into the street the lady followed her to the gate , cursing her all the time . " Do n't ever come back here , you thieving daughter of a whore ! " She had not thought of going anywhere in particular , but when the sickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lorry park behind the market . She went toward the fire of one of the women selling hot kelewele , and when the woman said nothing , she drew near and warmed herself by the fire . Soon she drew her cloth up tightly overhead , and . in the crouching position she had taken , went to sleep . Brusquely , she was shaken awake . Araba was still half asleep , but she saw that the fire and the women were no longer there . Two women , one of them in police uniform , were holding her . " Go inside ! " one of them shouted , and the other laughed . A small van stood nearby . A man came out of it and half lifted , half pushed Araba into the back . The policewoman sat by her , and had to wake her up again when they came to the gate of the Remand Home . It appeared the watchman was asleep , because the other woman had to rattle the knocker rather loudly before he came to open the tiny wicket . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Open the door ! " the woman snapped . Hurriedly , the old man opened the big gate and let in the woman and the girl . The police van drove off into the night , and the woman turned to the watchman . " You were sleeping , " she said archly. " 0 , Matron , no sah , madam . " " You lie . " The old man said nothing . The woman repeated , " You lie . " The watchman said uncomfortably , " Madam , Ah sleep small . Ah dey walk aw de day . Ah tire small . " " We pay you to watch , not to sleep . " The woman sounded a little less cross . " Ah . madam , how for do ? Money palaba . " " Good night , watchman . And do n't sleep . " The girl followed the woman into a long room . There were sounds of snoring . They stopped at an empty bed . " Here . " the woman said , " this is your bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke into excited whispers , but the girl was too sleepy to listen to them . Araba was relieved when the lady refused to take her back , though life at the Remand Home was at first quite hard . Somehow . the other girls managed to make her do their share of the work . But soon other girls were brought , and the girls stopped making fun of her and turned their attention to the newer ones . She even got to like them , and loved to listen when they talked in the night about all the things they knew and had done before coming to the Remand Home . Some of the girls were a little older than Araba , and they always talked of men and money . They said they would all escape one day , Indeed , from time to time someone would escape . Then the Matron would shout and scold the watchman , and treat the remaining girls very harshly ; but after a few days the fugitive would he brought back , and the matron would smile primly and tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you people . Always ! " Soon things would return to their normal state . The Matron never asked herself why the girls only escaped when their terms were nearly up . As for the girls , though they liked their short sallies into the world outside , they preferred the friendship of the others inside the house . If it pleased the Matron to think them very stupid , that was all to the good . Araba made two escapes , both times shortly before she was due to be released . To go back to her people now would have killed her with shame . For the third time , her time was drawing near . This time , however , she was going to wait . She worked very conscientiously now , and the Matron often said to the other girls , " Look at Araba . She is growing into a responsible woman . " Now the others liked her less , but she did not care very much . All that mattered to her was the Matron 's promise that if she would be a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a period of probation . There was no doubt that she was being a good girl , a very good girl , indeed , and this irritated the other girls , because they did not understand this change that had come over Araba since her second escape . She had kept it to herself . Not even the Matron could find out the story of Araba 's second flight into the town . That night the girls had talked for a long time about men . Listening to the other girls , Araba had felt foolish because she had no story of her own to tell . Still , the stories had excited her as if she herself had had all these things happen to her , and , early in the black morning , when she was climbing over the back wall of the Home , she had wondered what it would be like to live with men the way the other girls had done . She had left behind the long uniform of the Remand Home , and in her covershirt and cloth , she felt safe . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned her feet . She was very hungry . She went toward the market . In the park huge Ashanti lorries , covered with thick brown dust , were unloading foodstuffs onto the ground . The girl went toward a pile of mangoes and picked one up . " Hey , drop it ! " A driver 's mate , wiping the dust oil ' his face , swaggered toward her . He looked her up and down . " Anything wrong ? " he asked . His eyes came to rest on her face . " No , " she said simply . " You are hungry . " She nodded . He picked out three huge , ripe mangoes , and gave them to her . He came nearer to her . Though the park looked empty , he dropped his voice . " You have a place to sleep ? " She did not answer , but he went on . " Come here again . Six . " She was still there at sundown . When the boy came , she followed him through an interminable maze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a low , small house . The floor was down below ground level . He went in first , switched on the electric light , and called out to her . The room smelled of mud . She looked up at the lamp . It was a very weak , small bulb , hanging naked from an old beam in the center of the room . The cord looked frayed , and in the light she saw cobwebs there . There was no ceiling , only the roof . The boy walked the short space over to the far wall , and leaned against it . He indicated a bed to his left . " Sit down , " he said . The girl looked around her . The bed was the one piece of furniture in the room . " What is your name ? " " Araba , " she answered . " Araba ? " It was half repetition , half question . The girl nodded , but did not ask him anything . " Munro/in ) Arabs . " The boy stood still for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but when he held the cord around her waist , she began to struggle . He was trying to untie the knot . She held his hands . The knot slipped . and grew tighter . The boy was panting . He held his breath and laughed weakly . " You think you 're strong , eh ? " He pulled harder , but the cord was too strong . He stopped , and his panting grew louder now . Steadying his arm , he drew a small penknife from his pocket . Without a word , he cut the cord , and drew apart her undercloth . " I shall cut the beads , " he said , his voice tense . out of all control . That frightened her . They would find out at the Home . " No , no , " she protested . " I shall ? " Without completing her sentence she hurriedly removed the little bandage , but still , when he climbed into the bed , she struggled . She knew from the girls that that was the way . Silently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the elbow . he struck her a sharp blow in the thigh . She lay quite still , and the boy chuckled . Stretching out his right hand in an awkward movement . he put out the light . It was the next morning that she met Elizabeth . The boy had taken her there . The old woman lived in the last of a row of rooms each of which had a long , narrow green door . The boy had knocked on the door and called , " Elizabeth ! " The old woman 's voice asked , " Who ? " " Open the door . It 's me . " " Why you come so early ' n de morn ? " She ran the last words all together and grunted good-naturedly . " I have to work , " the man said . " I brought my cousin . " There was a soft , oily " O00000h , " and the old woman appeared . Her white hair was all over her face . The wrinkles in her face deepened witha story by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue played constantly around her smooth gums . She smiled at the girl , and the girl smiled back . The boy said , " Give her some food , then send her home . Ca n't hold her here . " With one last look at the girl , he turned and disappeared down the alleyway . The old woman took her in and let her sleep . In the daytime she gave her some very tasty food to eat . The women , young women , in the other rooms came , and were also very good to her . They listened to her , and asked her questions about herself and her people ? soon she told them things she had told no one before , and by their looks they seemed to understand , and she liked them for it . In the afternoon Elizabeth said she was sorry , but if she staved with them now the police would make trouble for her . She asked her gently , " Why do n't you go hack to the Home ? How long will they keep you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabs was not sure . " Time pass quick , chile . " Everybody laughed . and the girl laughed too . " Ever need ainthin ' , you come ' ere . Come back see us . " She had made her way to the center of the town , where the girls always went to get themselves recaptured . The old Elizabeth had slipped a two-shilling piece into her hand , and while she waited she bought some rice and stew and cake and toffee and ate it all . She could tell the other girls a lot of things they had never dreamed of . In the evening they came and took her . The policewoman was stern , and the Matron gloated , " I told you , Lady Constable . I knew where to find her . " Now the last day , the very last day , was over . She was going back to Elizabeth . Already she had thought of the place so often that she almost called it home . Elizabeth was sitting in front of her door when the girl came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 0 my chile , " she shouted , and the joy in her face was unmistakable , " you come back . " She rained questions excitedly at the girl . Was she hungry ? Did she not want to rest a little ? At least she was thirsty ? She gave the girl some cool water . More questions followed , and then after a brief silence Elizabeth asked , " Now what you for do ? " " I would like to trade . In the market . " " Jus ' now ? " the woman pressed . Araha nodded . The old woman burst out into loud peals of laughter . When she stopped laughing , she climbed up into her room and brought out a shiny key , and gave it to the girl . She pointed to one of the doors , and told the girl it was her room .

Everybody laughed very loudly , and very long . One of the women said , " Sissie , we all de same . But where money for trade ? " The laughter rose again , and another explained , " All de mammies wey den dey for market , where you tink say dey begin ? ' E be here ! " She turned her thumb down , pointing it between her thighs . There were wails of laughter all round the girl , and she understood .

She was going to be pleased with it , she told herself ; but still she had to fight this rushing , rising fear . She beckoned to the man , and climbed up to the little door . Over the thick bull shoulders of the man , she saw Elizabeth 's kind face . The old woman was smiling her encouragement . Briefly , the concrete posts of the Remand Home passed before the girl 's eyes . Then she looked again at the man before her . " Come in , " she said forcedly . The man cleared his throat , spat the mucus out by the doorstep , and climbed inside . The door closed behind the girl , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January 1969
