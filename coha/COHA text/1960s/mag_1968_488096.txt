Mr. Dempsey is professor of political science at the University of Michigan ( Dearborn ) , and co-chairman of the state Civil Rights Commission . Not for what it settles but for what it delays , not for what it reveals but for what it conceals , not for what it accomplishes but for what it portends , 1968 will go down in American history as an important political year . There is a pulse in the flow of American politics . Periodically , the nation arrives at a watershed , a convulsion , a fundamental realignment of the political scene ; thereafter , politics and the country are quite different . Half a dozen such moments have occurred in the American experience , and another is fast approaching . In 1800 the political party came of age as an instrument of government in our limited democracy , marking the end of the dominance of those who had led the Revolution and established the Constitution . In 1828 Jackson 's election symbolized the political maturation - of the frontier . Lincoln 's victory in 1860 marked the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American scene , as well as a rapid end to the legal existence of slavery ; the preservation of the Union also resulted . In 1896 big business overwhelmed American politics ; the 1912 triumph of Wilson heralded the , new freedom . FDR and the New Deal arrived in 1932 . These are the watershed years of American political history ; 1968 is obviously not one of them . Yet in each of the above heroic instances , the previous election foretold the approaching ? convulSion . Jefferson 's . victory hi 1800 came four years after the first breakdown in the electoral process and the inability of the Federalists to maintain their position , or their unity . In 1824 the dominant party was unable to agree on a single candidate , and the election was thrown into the House of Representatives . No party in 1856 could nominate a candidate able to face squarely the overwhelming issue of slavery ; Lincoln was found four years later . The election of 1892 settled nothing , except to accentuate a split within the Democratic Party and pave the way for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its back on progressivism , and helped assure Wilson 's election in 1912 . And in 1928 both parties failed to address themselves to the plight of the farmer or the storm signals in the economy ; concentrating instead on the politics of joy . The depression and the New Deal followed . Now 1968 takes its place among - these years of shOrt sight and low morale . Both major parties have taken their stands on the issues and the slogans of the past , and have dissembled on the problems of the present . Thus 1968 paves the way for the convulsions of the future . At least four major issues confront the American THE NATioNlOctober 28 , 1968 people this year : the war in Vietnam , the future of race relations in the United States , the condition of the cities , and the character and dignity of life for all Americans . The three major candidates for President are each addressing themselves to these issues in terms ambiguous at best . Hubert Humphrey holds out peace in Vietnam , or at least an end to the bombing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promises peace with honor , even while he supports ( at least tacitly ) the policies which produced the war . George Wallace promises he 'll turn the war over to the Joint Chiefs of Staff , evidently believing that those gentlemen have not previously been consulted on the subject . Or perhaps he 'll just turn it over to Curtis LeMay , leaving himself free , if elected , to concentrate on the home front . Richard Nixon talks of " building bridges to human dignity , ? but does not believe economic sanctions should be used to help achieve it . Hubert Humphrey promises much more of what has been done , evidently feeling that past programs have been resoundingly successful . George Wallace says he will so be President of " all ' the people " ; and to those who tag him " racist , " he points out that lots of Negroes voted for Lurleen  --  which was a comment , primarily , on the views of her opponents . Mr. Nixon would turn over the major part of the rebuilding of the cities to private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take on the task . Vice President Humphrey would have the federal government lead the way in urban reconstruction , causing some to wonder what Washington has been doing for the past thirty-five years while the cities were decaying . Mr. Wallace says little about re , - building cities , preferring first to , make the existing streets safe for the people ; pleasant communities will grow up , presumably , around the much enlarged police stations . Concerning the question and meaning Of life for the average American , no candidate is saying much . Each offers to guarantee law and order and a stable dollar  --  and that 's what life 's all about anyway . None of this implies that any of the major candidates is being dishonest or deliberately deceitful . Rather , each apparently believes that the citizens will vote principally on the basis of their emotions  --  or , more simply , their fears . Wallace appeals to fear of the black man ; Nixon appeals to fear of the Democrats , and of the recent past ; Humphrey appeals to fear of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of poor old Herbert Hoover . Not one of the three seems to realize that while such appeals may have a limited and temporary success , a stable society can be constructed only by overcoming fear , not by catering to it . And each of the men overlooks a central fact of American development  --  the people are more highly educated and informed today than ever before ; the emotional approaches of the past simply lack the strength they once had . In this fact lies the cause of the widespread ( 425 apathy , and of the disunity which is just below the surface of both major parties . It is fashionable today , in at least some circles , to . compare the Wallace appeal with Hitler 's in the Germany of the 1920s . While this is no compliment to the " mighty bantam from Alabama , " it 's a downright insult to the American people as a whole . The United States of 1968 is not the Weimar Republic of 1930 , and to suggest that it is is seriously to distort history . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has not , witnessed ruinous inflation , it has not seen its middle class wiped out  --  quite the contrary . The Wallace appeal stems partly from a weariness and resentment at politics as usual , at promises made and not kept , at lack of leadership and lack of ethics in so many , many places . Many say : " He tells it like it is , " " He 's the only one who talks like a real American , " or simply , " At least he 's honest  --  he says what he believes . " A large vote for Wallace on November 5 will be interpreted as a white backlash ; it can also be a clear indication that many people have become tired of the two major parties , with their reliance on outmoded solutions to contemporary problems . If there is any meaning in the iemarkable record of the candidacy of Eugene McCarthy , or the rapid surge of the late Robert Kennedy , or the popular appeal of John Lindsay or Nelson Rockefeller , it is that their supporters believed these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certainly glamour , charm and , in some cases , money were all involved ; yet Romney and Percy and Reagan also have these qualities . Just as Wallace 's appeal is greatest among the least educated in the United States , and among the older citizens  --  those who , like him , see life in the most simple terms  --  so the appeal of McCarthy , Kennedy , Lindsay and Rockefeller is greatest among the best educated and the young , who realize that life can not be simple . This is encouraging , because each year the American electorate grows younger , and on the average better educated . It 's just that the leaders of the political establishment have n't quite awakened to the facts of modern life . Yet we can not dismiss George Wallace quite so neatly , at least not in 1968 . For he is a mischief-maker who can knock the political train off the tracks . This possibility arises from the fact that , for whatever reasons , he does appeal to many , coupled with circumstances , under which the electoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wallace can throw the election into the House of Representatives , for the first time in 144 years ( the 1876 election went there , not to elect a President but rather to determine whom the electors had elected : the House in the end settled on a process which produced Hayes  --  and a suspicion that has never really been laid to rest ) . As of now , Wallace . is almost sure to take at least thirty-nine electoral votes , and he could take more ( he claims a minimum of 170 , but he may well have the capacity to be wrong , like the rest of us ) . In some normally Democratic states he may draw enough support from Humphrey to give the electoral votes to Nixon ; and in some normally Republican states ( there are a few ) he may take enough from Nixon to give the state to Humphrey . As a result , prediction at this moment is almost impos- ' 426 sible  --  or at least foolish . Yet the effect of the Wallace candidacy may be to throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen , the next President is certain to be Hubert Humphrey . This safe prediction is possible because of the distribution of votes in the House . In choosing a President each state has one vote in the House , a vote decided by the partisan control of the Congressional delegation from that state . Today , Democrats control twenty-nine state delegations , Republicans control eighteen , and three are evenly divided and therefore could not vote if all Representatives were present . This balance may well be different after November 5 , but unless Nixon achieves a landslide ( in which case the election would n't go to the House ) , there is almost no chance that the Republicans will control twentysix state delegations in the next Congress ( the number needed to elect ) . Thus Democrats would be in ' firm command . To be sure , at least five of the twenty-nine Democratic delegations are today controlled by Wallace supporters , who could demand concessions and promises and all sorts of political booty  --  from either loyalist Democrats or Republicans . However , it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would most need , committee chairmanships and Congressional powers , so in the end " Democratic Party unity " would surely prevail . If Hubert Humphrey should become President in this fashion , the already damaged Democratic Party will be further injured ; if such a result followed an inconclusive electoral ' college vote in which Richard Nixon secured a plurality of the popular vote but was then denied the Presidency , the result could shatter the Democratic Party beyond repair ( it has already lost many of its supporters to the New Party , or to others on the Left ) . And the damage to America 's prestige abroad would be incalculable THE NATION/ October 28 , 1968 ( we ca n't explain the normal functioning of the electoral college to most foreigners ; how to explain its malfunctioning ? ) . So Wallace is a major threat  --  and he at least knows it . Yet suppose we escape all of the above , what is likely to be the result ' ) As of now , it is probable that Richard Nixon will win , but certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 45 per cent ) . Hubert Humphrey will run second , and George Wallace a strong third . The new Congress will be much more conservative than its predecessor . The result will be at least two years , and probably four , of inaction on the major problems which face America . So the 1968 election will then not really have settled anything , and the disillusionment with vague platforms and fancy but empty campaign promises will grow . It has all happened before ! In 1972 , the young voters who are today demanding answers will be even more numerous . The educational level of the electorate will have climbed still further . Many of the elderly who this year follow George Wallace will have left this troubled planet ; yet the troubles will not have eased . Each of these developments will have a major effect on the next election . It is my belief that in 1968 we see an unraveling of the political alignments that have held generally since 1932 . This is to assert a commonplace . Yet it is also my belief that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the decline of the old issues . The Civil War ended for all time constitutional questions about the nature of the Union which had been fought over since the beginning ; granted , it took a generation or two for the settlement to seep through to some parts of the land . Similarly , the Great Depression and the New Deal ended the political questions as to whether the government has a role to play in the economy , and a responsibility for the welfare of the citizen ; granted , it has taken a generation or two for that settlement to be recognized throughout our society . Today , the problems which plague the American people are largely social ones , including the relationships of man to his environment and to his fellow man , as well as his responsibility for his fellow man and for his environment . The Presidential candidates in 1968 do not realize this change because they were raised on the old issues , and trained in the old rhetoric . Yet an increasingly large portion of the electorate does realize that the world has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fore . In that sense the 1968 , election is a prelude to tomorrow .
