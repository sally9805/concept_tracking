" I have persisted in being what I am , " says Baltimore 's Henry G. Parks Jr . That is why Parks years ago rejected the advice of a counselor at Ohio State 's College of Commerce , who urged him : " Go to South America , where you will have a real chance . " Parks , a strapping 6-ft. 3-in. man , felt that he could better make his way in U.S. business-even though he is a Negro . Parks was right ; he went on to found H. G. Parks Inc. , a sausagemaking firm that had 1968 sales of $6,128,481 and profits of $243,812 . Last week H. G. Parks offered its shares to the public for the first time , overnight becoming one of the largest publicly-owned black firms in the U.S. <P> The offering of 220,000 shares at $8 each was quickly oversubscribed , and shares rose to about $12.50 by week 's end . New capital will enable Parks to expand his model sausage factory in Baltimore and to fatten his rather limited product line . About 12,000 stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sausages and scrapple . Soon to come are quick-cooking sausages , beef sausages , and what Parks calls " the whole line of Southern foods , such as barbecued anything . " <P> Cold Shoulder . Atlanta-born Parks grew up in Dayton , Ohio . His father was a wine steward , his mother a some time domestic servant . After working his way through Ohio State ( ' 39 ) ; he joined the Pabst Brewing Co. and later headed a small group of Negro salesmen who cultivated ghetto markets for the firm . After settling in Baltimore in 1944 , he started the sausage firm in 1951 . Just what he did during the years between is a bit vague . <P> Parks has long been a friend of William L. Adams , sometimes known as Little Willie , whom the Senate Crime Investigating Committee in 1951 named as Baltimore 's top operator of the numbers games . Little Willie is a director of the sausage company , and until last week he and Parks each owned 44% of its shares ; now each has 26%-a controlling majority between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his earlier years , that was possibly due to the fact that he was cold-shouldered by white bankers . <P> Spicy Enough . In the beginning , Parks and two employees started grinding out sausages in an old Baltimore dairy . Word quickly spread through the ghetto grapevine that the manufacturer was a black man , and Negroes supported him at the supermarket counters . At present , Parks sells mostly to white people , and about 15% of his employees are white . " I work very hard to run a business , and not a Negro business , " says Parks , who has been elected to a second term as a city councilman from a Baltimore Negro district . <P> Parks believes that he will benefit from the tendency of people to " buy up , and buy out . " By " up " he means higher quality , and by " out " foreign foods like Mexican and Chinese . Parks feels that his products are spicy enough to ride the fringes of the foreign trend . To insure their quality , the boss himself acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem by making a rather deft change . Parents and even schoolchildren had written in to complain about the company 's shrill radio spot ads , in which a child cries , " More Parks Sausages , Mom ! " That has since been modified to " More Parks Sausages , Mom-please ! "
