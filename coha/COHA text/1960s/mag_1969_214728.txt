The final judgment on any President lies with history-and historians . Few scholars would care today to deliver a definitive verdict on Dwight Eisenhower , but many have formed tentative opinions . Asked by TIME to assess Ike as President , general and citizen , some leading historians had some well-defined-and remarkably consonant-views : <P> - James MacGregor Burns , Williams College , author of Presidential Government : " The Eisenhower Administration was a fine consolidating Administration , with all the benefits that come from consolidation and with all its problems . But the serious questions are whether then , or at any time , we can afford consolidation . The greatest thing about Eisenhower was that he did not turn back the clock . " <P> - Clinton Rossiter , Cornell University , author of The American Presidency : " I think Eisenhower will not be remembered as a great President . He will be remembered as a great person . I do n't think Eisenhower intended to be a great President , because he did n't believe in the exercise of presidential power . The country needed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a four-year , not an eight-year need . Still , for the first time since Jack Kennedy , I shed tears . " <P> - Sidney Hyman , University of Chicago , author of The Politics of Consensus : " Marshal Joffre once said that it takes 16,000 men to train one major general . And it often takes many more casualties to train a President . But when you look at Ike 's presidency from the perspective of time , lots of things the days hide are revealed by the years . You see that there were surprisingly few casualties required to train Eisenhower . There 's nothing dramatic about the kind of work that Eisenhower did , so he suffers by comparison with the trombones-and-drums kind of President . But in terms of what service he performed , I would give him a B-plus . " <P> - James Banner , Princeton University : " His Administration was a period of drift rather than mastery . There was a social revolution occurring , and Eisenhower was not aware of it . He left it to Kennedy and Johnson , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Eisenhower and only Eisenhower who struck out at the military-industrial complex . That was the high point of his presidency . " <P> - Frank Freidel , Harvard University , author of a multi-volume biography of F.D.R. : " He elected to retain Government responsibility for the welfare of the people . This was his most significant accomplishment . It is what made it possible for Kennedy and Johnson to move forward . If one of the right-wing group had been elected , Kennedy and Johnson would have had to spend a lot of time recouping . With the Eisenhower years as a plateau and a period of consolidation , it was possible to move forward in the Kennedy-Johnson years . " <P> - Arthur Link , Princeton University , editor of the papers of Woodrow Wilson : " Hemmed in , hobbled by a lifetime of experience in the Army , Mr. Eisenhower never really came to grips with the basic problems of presidential leadership . Still , historians will be generous to him . He did , at the end of a period of extreme political turmoil and bitterness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality that enabled him to effect a healing of wounds and a reconciliation of the leadership of both parties .
