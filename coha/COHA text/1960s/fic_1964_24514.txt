IN THE CORRIDOR Bond shuts the cell door behind him , lays the key on a pile of rags and walks down the corridor putting on his jacket . As he nears the end of the corridor , we see a basement control room ahead containing a hydraulic lift and we hear voices from above : GOLDFINGER ( O.S. ) The underworld will rock with applause for centuries .

GOLDFINGER ( O.S. ) My plan is foolproof , gentlemen . UNDER THE MODEL Bond stands on the hydraulic platform . He jumps down , looks around , tears a piece of paper from a rolled-up document and grabs a pencil . He runs back under the model and looks through it again . Meanwhile we hear Goldfinger continue : GOLDFINGER ( O.S. ) I call it Operation Grand Slam . I have devoted fifteen years of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every eventuality has been considered .

This fence surrounding the depository , as Mister Strap reminded us , is electrified . It will be dynamited . My task force will then move to the main entrance and demolish it . SOLO How , may I ask ? GOLDFINGER You made that possible , Mister Solo , by arranging , through your considerable influence in shipping circles , to bring through customs uninspected a consignment labeled machine parts . All that will then remain is to descend to the vaults where the bullion is stored . SOLO I 've heard enough . STRAP Let him finish . SOLO ( interrupting ) If you have no objection ...

Under the model , Bond watches . GOLDFINGER Gentlemen , we must respect Mister Solo 's decision . Please excuse me for a few minutes while I take care of him . Make yourselves comfortable . Goldfinger leads Solo toward the door . UNDER THE MODEL Bond takes the Homer from his heel , folds the paper around it and slips it into his pocket . He looks through the model again . He hears general hubbub from the gangsters , and a few clear words : FIRST GANGSTER How do we get it out ? SECOND GANGSTER That 's the bit I want to hear . THIRD GANGSTER Yeah , and it had better be good . TILT DOWN to Bond 's feet . Suddenly a pair of hands grab his ankles and yank on them . He falls face-down onto the platform . The hands pull him back and hurl him against a wall . He turns around and suddenly stops . His assailant is Pussy . She glares at him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who taught you judo ?
