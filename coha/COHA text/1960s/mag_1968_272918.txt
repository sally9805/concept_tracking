Whenever the cost of borrowing swings to extreme highs or lows , financiers regard it as a signal of national ill-health . Last week interest rates for long-term securities climbed to a level that clearly meant economic fever . <P> For example , underwriters provided $25 million worth of Kansas City Power &; Light bonds with a 6.67% rate , a record among top-grade electric utilities . New York City sold $45 million worth of housing bonds that offered investors up to 5.36% tax free , the juiciest return on a city issue since the early ' 30s . Most startling of all , the Federal Government paid its highest interest rate since the Civil War*-6.45% per year-to sell part of a $1 billion issue of securities . <P> That rate reflects Wall Street 's disquiet over the huge federal budget deficit , which portends gigantic federal borrowing and still higher interest rates in the months just ahead . The 6.45% return applied to Federal National Mortgage Association " participation certificates " - shares in a pool of Government-owned mortgages and other loans . They were available to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct obligation of the U.S. Treasury , the participation certificates come close to that gilt-edged status because the Attorney General has ruled that they are backed by the full faith and credit of the Government . <P> Ironically , last week 's sale served to stir up potential trouble in another quarter . Wall Street called it " the great money rush . " Enticed by the 6.45% return on a Government-backed security with interest payments every six months , salesmen and secretaries , doctors and housewives overwhelmed traders with buying orders . One result was an unexpected drain on savings banks , one of the major sources of mortgage money . If it continues , the outflow could lead to another shortage of home loans-the very kind of shortage FNMA was created to help prevent . <P> <P> * When , in July 1861 , Abraham Lincoln 's hard-pressed Government sold a $50 million , 6% loan , redeemable in 1881 , only by the device of marking each $100 of bonds down to $89.25 , thus raising the interest yield to 6.7%.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
