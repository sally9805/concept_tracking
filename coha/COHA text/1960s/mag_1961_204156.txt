Ill-shaven , nervous , speaking in halting French , Belkacem Krim was clearly a better guerrilla leader than a diplomat ; he understood little of the give and take of negotiation . Yet last week Krim was winning good marks for his leadership of the F.L.N. delegation at the French lakeside resort of Evian-les-Bains . France 's Algerian Affairs Minister Louis Joxe was impressed by Krim 's obvious sincerity , his single-mindedness , and the studied moderation of his language . " He and his kind were hunted like wolves for years on end , " said one French delegate . " It would be futile to expect an F.L.N. leader to be a polished statesman . " <P> Still nervous about having rebels in town , the security-conscious Swiss refused to allow Krim to hold regular press conferences , instead set up a closed TV circuit between Krim 's heavily guarded villa on the Geneva lakefront and the Maison de la Presse , three miles away , where Krim 's image was projected on a huge screen in the main auditorium . First subject on Krim 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Algeria . Instead of welcoming an end to the fighting , Krim denounced it as " blackmail , " called it " premature from a military , psychological and political point of view . " <P> What worries Krim and the F.L.N. is that guerrilla forces traditionally disintegrate unless they are under constant military pressure . Should fighting cease , the rugged F.L.N. bands will be tempted to lay down their arms and abandon their mountain hideouts , thus leaving the F.L.N. without a military force in being . To meet the threat of peace , the rebels last week redoubled their efforts in Algeria with a rash of isolated assassinations and bomb throwings . At Miliana , 90 miles from Algiers , rebels ambushed a convoy , killing eleven gendarmes . At Sidi Aich , in rugged Kabylia , 14 Moslem soldiers in the French army deserted to the F.L.N. , killing four French soldiers and four Moslems who refused to join them . <P> European settlers in Algeria were bitter . " Naturally , " said one , " the F.L.N. will take advantage of the truce to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would do anything else . " Even Moslem sympathizers were disappointed by the F.L.N. 's rejection of De Gaulle 's offer of a ceasefire . If the talks at Evian end in a stalemate , the F.L.N. 's stubborn decision to keep fighting may backfire . <P> At week 's end French Delegate Joxe made a flying trip to Paris to see De Gaulle , returned to tell newsmen at Evian that " all interested persons , " i.e. , the F.L.N .. will be consulted " in detail " before an Algerian referendum on a choice between independence , association or " Francization . " He implied that France was prepared to accept joint French-F.L.N. supervision of the referendum . Joxe also sought to calm F.L.N. fears of a partition of Algeria on racial lines . Though citing India as a nation that had been forced to accept partition , Joxe maintained that France would do its best to see that partition did not become necessary-but that required convincing guarantees from the rebels that Algeria 's million Europeans will be neither discriminated against nor forced to lose their French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
