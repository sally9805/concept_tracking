What ever became of the chaos in Laos ? Last year at this time the pro-Communist Pathet Lao were strutting lumpily across the Plain of Jars in their dun-colored uniforms , proudly triumphant over the " neutralist " forces of General Kong Le and threatening to overrun the entire country . To be sure , the Pathet Lao are still there-and stronger than ever . According to U.S. officials , the Laotian Reds have been bolstered by 10,000 North Vietnamese troops . But with the monsoon already hampering military operations , they have failed for the first time since 1960 to mount a spring offensive . <P> Rice &; Rifles . The main reason is U.S. escalation of the war in neighboring Viet Nam . U.S. jets , striking out of Thailand , Danang and the Gulf of Tonkin at supply routes from the north , have kept the Pathet Lao pinned down . Since North Viet Nam considers Laos a sideshow anyhow , the Laotian Communists recently have had short shrift in supplies from Hanoi . <P> What is more , the anti-Communist Laotian armies of Kong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight effectively together . A joint operation not only cleared and held the northern sector of the Vien-tiane-Luangprabang road ( see map ) but has produced more than 300 Pathet Lao defectors as well . <P> <P> Unlike their Viet Cong comrades in South Viet Nam , the Pathet Lao are a conventional fighting force equipped with trucks and armored cars that bog down in the monsoon mud . Moreover , the Laotian anti-Communists now have effective insurgent bands afield in Red territory . They consist mainly of 6,000 American-supplied Meo tribesmen , tough little primitives skilled in the savage techniques of ambush and night assault . Meo loyalty has been sealed by a U.S. airlift of rice ( $6,500,000 worth this year alone ) , which feeds 160,000 tribesmen . Along with the kernels come rifles , grenades and ammunition to replace the traditional Meo crossbows . <P> Votes &; the Red Prince . If things are going well militarily in Laos , they are as hazy as ever politically . Neutralist Premier Souvanna Phouma must deal with a country half occupied by Communists , half hung up on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major attempts to overthrow his government in the past four months , and rightist bands loyal to exiled Deputy Premier Phoumi Nosavan-in Thailand since February 's coup attempt-still prowl the countryside between Paksane and Thakhek . <P> But suave , smooth Souvanna is far from panicky . Sucking his pipe , he steps gingerly through the subtle maze of Laotian politics , playing the delicate game of nods , winks and selective handshakes . At a recent Soviet reception , Souvanna greeted his Russian hosts warmly , then whisked carefully past the Red Chinese and North Vietnamese to shake hands with the British , French and U.S. ambassadors . <P>
