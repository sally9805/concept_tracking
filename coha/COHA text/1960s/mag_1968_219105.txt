When the flame is lit this week for the 10th Winter Olympics at Grenoble , France , TV will carry the Games to 200 million people around the world . One sport and one athlete will dominate everyone 's attention . The sport is Alpine skiing-with its hurtling downhill races and snow-spraying slaloms . The athlete is France 's Jean-Claude Killy , an innkeeper 's son from Val d'Isre in the French Alps , whose lan and ebullience have made him an almost legendary figure at the age of 24 . <P> For kicks , Killy races fast cars and jumps from airplanes ; he has tried his hand at bullfighting , and he has a well-deserved reputation as something of a flake . During an exhibition ski jump in Switzerland , Jean-Claude shocked spectators by dropping his trousers in midair . He once left a Volkswagen parked in the middle of an Italian hotel lobby , and three years ago , just for laughs , he and some buddies fired off revolvers on the main street of Vail , Colo . <P> Supreme Trophy . But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . In four years , he has scored a total of 48 major international victories , including ten special slaloms , 16 giant slaloms , ten downhill races and twelve combined championships . Last year he shattered all previous records by entering 32 races and winning 23 . In a sport where victory or defeat is usually a matter of split seconds , his winning margins were all but incredible : almost two seconds in the special slalom at Kitzbhel , Austria , three seconds in the downhill at Megve , France . With the maximum possible score of 225 points , he skied off with the World Cup , the supreme trophy of the sport . <P> It was a supreme trophy for France as well . A relatively new sport , Alpine skiing only acquired Olympic recognition in 1936 , and it has become virtually a private French preserve since Coach Honor Bonnet , 48 , a feisty little ex-army officer , took over the team in 1959 . Bonnet taught his racers the aerodynamic " oeuf " position that won a gold medal in the downhill for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in slick nylon stretch suits instead of baggy trousers and tops , switched them from wood to more maneuverable metal skis , made training an intensive , year-round proposition , stressed strength and speed over the niceties of technique . <P> To all that , Jean-Claude Killy has added a superb disdain for danger and an almost superhuman capacity for concentration . Nobody takes a slalom gate quite the way he does-hurtling round the pole with his body slung out sideways , almost parallel to the snow . Nobody else has quite mastered his avalement technique of accelerating on the downhill turns-rocking back on his haunches and thrusting his skis so far forward that he seems certain to fall . Few have the courage to ski , as he puts it , " toujours mort . " And few can match his mental approach to a race . " When I ski , I ski , " he says . " I am all alone with the mountain . I leave everything else aside . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
