For centuries the roving bandit gangs of Sardinia terrorized the island 's people into a grim , submissive silence known as omerta . The impoverished citizenry never dared to speak out against the outlaws , who robbed , kidnaped , blackmailed and murdered virtually without fear of punishment . Lately , the bandits have been pushing the Sardinians a bit harder than usual . They began robbing middle-class citizens as well as the wealthier islanders . They grew more vicious , asking outrageous ransoms and even killing some of their kidnap victims . As a result , the Sardinians have finally rebelled against the tyranny ; they are not only breaking their long silence but are taking up arms against the bandits . <P> Breathless Accounts . Young people have organized into associations to combat the briganti , have tacked up posters denouncing their terrorism and sought to expose townspeople who collaborate with them . From their pulpits , the island 's Roman Catholic priests have declared a moral war on the bandits . The mayor of the northern town of Nuoro has demanded their punishment , crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " ( We want justice ! ) . Nearly 1,000 shepherds and hunters have joined carabinieri and police dogs in searching for the bandits ' mountain hideouts in the island 's northwest . In recent weeks , they have combed through almost 800 sq . mi. of rocky terrain honeycombed with gorges and grottoes . <P> The major success of the antibandit drive to date has been the capture of the most celebrated bandit of them all , Graziano Mesina , 26 . The darkly handsome Mesina , an idol to many Sardinian women and youth , surrendered without a fight last month when stopped at a police roadblock . But thousands of his cohorts have managed to elude their pursuers and blithely continue to collect their ransoms . Feeding the specter of fear , they have sent their kidnap victims back home with breathless accounts of their cruelty . " They talked in an atmosphere of bestial excitement , " reported wealthy Cattleman Giovanni Campus , 32 , whose family paid the bandits $48,000 for his release . " I was imprisoned for 19 days . My nervous system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against my brain so that I had to keep myself from crying out in desperation . " <P> Feet Dragging . Last week the bandits released the son of an automobile dealer whose family had ignited the campaign against them . Once again , they claimed a victory . While the relatives of Nino Petretto , 37 , had originally refused to ransom him , in the end they decided that it was wiser to pay the bandits ' $8,000 rather than risk his death or mutilation . Many islanders are still anxious to fight the bandits , but they know that they will need outside help to do it . The Italian government has dragged its feet even on appointing a commission that was approved by the Chamber of Deputies in Rome last November to look into the causes of banditry . Italian Interior Minister Paolo Taviani , who paid a hurried visit to the island this month , reported that the only cure for banditry is " massive industrialization " and " a radical transformation of the island 's pastoral mentality . " If that is so , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their island of the terror .
