BUSINESSMEN have been worrying that higher taxes , tight money and the rising cost of labor would combine to pinch their profits this year . That feeling was strengthened when a drop in automakers ' earnings stalled the six-year rise in total industrial profits during the second quarter . But last week early reports for the third quarter indicated that corporate income has rebounded to a new postwar peak of close to $50 billion a year after taxes . <P> Sharp profit increases spread across such industries as electric manufacturing , data processing , papermaking , drugs and rubber . Record third-quarter earnings were reported by such diverse companies as General Foods , Chas , Pfizer , Bristol-Myers , Honeywell , Olin Mathieson Chemical , Sun Oil , Crown Zellerbach and U.S. Rubber . Sperry Rand 's after-tax income was up 44% from the third quarter of last year , Republic Steel 's 49% , Alcoa 's 66% , W. R. Grace 's 74% , Polaroid 's 77% . Still , profits fell short of investor expectations for numerous companies in aircraft , chemicals , machinery and building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter : <P> &gt; General Electric , where 5,900 striking defense workers last week were ordered back to work under a Taft-Hartley Act injunction , enjoyed record sales of $1.8 billion , up 21% , and record profits of $99,228,000 , up 16% from the third quarter a year ago . Westinghouse , which at week 's end settled with 40,000 electrical workers , reported a 14% gain , with profits up to $31,284,000 . <P> &gt; Radio Corporation of America thrived on color television . Having doubled its production facilities for receiving sets , RCA boosted profits 29% above the previous year 's mark , to $29,900,000 . <P> &gt; Xerox , battling competition from some 40 other electrostatic office copiers , reflected a pressure common in many other industries : shrinking profits per dollar of sales . Despite peak revenues , profits slipped 8% below those of the second quarter of 1966 ( to $18,719,378 ) , though they remained 27% above last year 's third quarter . <P> &gt; Eastman Kodak , thanks to a rising demand for color film , clicked off a $82,279,000 profit , up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reynolds , the nation 's No. 1 tobacco manufacturer , cashed in on the growing popularity of king-size cigarettes with record $37,335,000 profits , up 5.4% , even though sales of regular-size Camels continued to decline in line with the industry trend . <P> &gt; United Air Lines , shut down 43 days by the airling strike that ended Aug. 19 , reported a $2,017,000 loss against $21,369,239 profit in the third quarter of 1965 . The setback was cushioned by $17,296,000 received from four nonstruck lines under a mutual-aid agreement , and by post-strike earnings of $6,353,000 in September , when passenger travel spurted 20% above its last-year level . American Airlines , which continued to fly , paid $29 million to strike-bound carriers , nevertheless earned $24,447,017-a 52% increase from last year 's third quarter . <P> &gt;Weyerhaeuser Co. , giant of the forest-products field , suffered a 17% falloff in profits , to $16,662,500 , despite record sales . Chief reason : a sharp drop in building-materials prices caused by the slump in home building .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
