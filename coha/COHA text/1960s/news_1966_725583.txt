txt There is indeed a Romney boom . Some key supporters across the nation have offered to start working in his behalf for 1968 . These offers have come in the last two weeks . But the Michigan Governor has made it very clear that he will have absolutely nothing to do with such a move at this time . Gov . George Romney has disclosed to intimates that the public endorsement from Gov . Nelson A. Rockefeller was something he would have preferred to have omitted . He likes the New York Governor but thinks the political embrace from Mr. Rockefeller might cut into the plurality he expects in his fall race for reelection . Further , in careful checks with those who have been close to both the New York and Pennsylvania political scenes , it becomes clear that : ? Despite the concurrency of the new disavowals by both Mr. , Rockefeller and Gov . William W. Scranton of Pennsylvania of any // // presidential aspirations , there is no evidence of any collaboration between these two men . Their withdrawals from the 1968 race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moderates to settle on one candidate . ? At close range the Rockefeller move is seen as primarily political ? to reassure the voters of his state that he is only interested in being reelected governor . It is also seen as a means of reassuring Sen. Jacob K. Javits ( R ) of New York , who says he dropped out of the race for governor in return for the Rockefeller promise that he would never again seek the presidency . Governor Rockefeller undoubtedly saw his move as helpful to Governor Romney . But the Michigan Governor is known to have doubts about how helpful the Rockefeller boost would be among the large and powerful conservative elements in Michigan . Strong wording noted The Scranton declaration is so strongly worded that it seems to leave no doubt that he has said good-by to further political life . While the Pennsylvania Governor has always been disinclined to run for public office , now those who are closest to him  --  and who have sometimes been responsible for pushing him into political life  --  admit that the Scranton words are final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Governor Romney is really caught in the political middle at this point . He definitely is interested in the presidential nomination . But he feels he must keep a posture of relative disinterest until 1966 is over . He knows that the Michigan voters could cool quickly to a man who openly was seeking another elective office at the same time he was asking for their support this fall . Yet the Romney aspirations are beginning to seep out . He has rather unexpectedly ventured the opinion that former Vice-President Richard M. Nixon " is not the only man who could unite the Republican Party . " Who else besides Mr , Nixon ? Mr. Romney could well have been thinking of the current Governor of Michigan . Why not McNamara , some analysts ask By Richard L. Strout Staff correspondent of The Christian Science Monitor Washington Robert , S. McNamara , in the opinion of many here , has every requirement for being a Republican presidential candidate except one : He is a loyal member of President Johnson 's Cabinet . Nothing on a personal basis in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the discovery that Defense Secretary McNamara , known as an icy human computer , is a warm , witty , and philosophical person underneath . Hardly a columnist or news magazine has failed to comment . Curiously enough , the foil against whom Mr. McNamara is often contrasted is his boss , President Johnson . Mr. McNamara , out of a clear sky , made two speeches . Rarely in modern times have any talks had such an effect . One was at Montreal , May 19 , before the American Society of Newspaper Editors . The other May 22 , at his daughter 's graduation exercises at Chatham College , Pittsburgh . The McNamara speeches came at a strategic minute . The nation seemed bored with Vietnam . It was beginning to be bored with // *'d8 whisper : McNamara ? // President Johnson , too . At least his popularity in the opinion polls has plummeted spectacularly . Interest in Mr. McNamara himself has built up ? the " man of iron , " the imperscnal " calculating machine , " the overlord who cracked the whip over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Comparison presented Mr. Johnson has dropped the week-byweek formal press conferences of his predecessors by which the country could keep in touch with him . Without meaning to , Mr. McNamara sud- denly presented himself in terms of comparison with his superior . The style was different , and some suspected policy differences , perhaps unfairly . A thread of political speculation ran through comments . Typical reactions : Columnist Marquis Childs ? " Broadly intellectual . . . . One of the extraordinary things about this man is the way he can change gears without seeming effort . " Walter Lippmann ? " It is no secret that Secretary McNa ma ra 's Montreal speech , which broke so radically with the ideology of the administration , grew out of increasing skepticism and doubt . . . . " Richard Wilson , columnist ? " The Montreal speech has renewed speculation on his political future . " Life magazine ( Hugh Sidey ) June 3 ? " While not in disagreement with the administration this Montreal speech was such a change in style for the nation 's chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " Others comment Other columns commented typically : Mary McGrory , Washington Star ? " Washington was still in a state of shock . . . . " Clayton Fritchey ? " You ca n't blame Republicans for harboring a small hope that perhaps another Eisenhower . . . may be in the offing . " Gerald Griffin ( Baltimore Sun ) ? " . .. it follows automatically that someone begins to measure him for the presidency , or at least the vice-presidency . . . . Could McNamara become Secretary of State ? " National Observer , . June 6 ( James Dickenson ) ? " Suddenly , he 's presidential material . . . . " Aside from columnists , many in Washington see the situation in these terms : There is no " new " McNamara . He 's always been this way  --  complex . There is no policy difference with President Johnson . Johnson-McNamara relations could hardly be better ; the President pooh-poohs comments like Walter Lippman 's ( not to use a stronger term ) . Mr. McNamara is nominally a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the President . He has no independent political base  --  a considerable handicap . On the other hand , Mr. McNamara is the outstanding Cabinet member . He is a possible candidate for a kind of " assistant president . " His stature seems to be growing . He takes on heavier and heavier burdens for Mr. Johnson . The two McNamara speeches cracked through hardening circles to the administration . It showed him as a humane philosopher who could challenge armaments as the nation 's sole defense , and who could end a speech by asking , " Who is man ? " If the nation got bored enough with the supposed Hubert H. Humphrey-Robert F. Kennedy rivalry it might turn to somebody else . Why not Mr. McNamara ?
