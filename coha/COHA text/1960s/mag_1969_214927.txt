Man 's worst moments seem to fascinate Poland 's avant-garde composer Krzysztof Penderecki . In his Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima , Dies Irae ( an oratorio in memory of the dead of Auschwitz ) and The Passion and Death of Jesus Christ According to St. Luke , Penderecki treated mass annihilation and murder with moving intensity , stretching the limits of orchestral and vocal range so far that he had to invent new notational symbols for his score ( TIME , Oct. 14 , 1966 ) . Thus it was only appropriate that for his first opera he chose as his subject a tale of mass hysteria and political murder . <P> Hell on Earth . Penderecki based The Devils of Loudun on both Aldous Huxley 's historical essay and John Whiting 's play The Devils . The libretto sketches the facts surrounding the torture and execution of a Jesuit priest in a 17th century French provincial town . Sister Jeanne of the Angels , prioress of St. Ursula 's Convent , asks Father Urbain Grandier ( sung by Baritone Andre Hiolski ) to become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declines the offer , Sister Jeanne has a series of hysterical sexual hallucinations that soon infect other nuns in the convent . Eventually , the sisters accuse Grandier of indecent and immoral behavior , which has led to their being possessed by the devil . The charges coincide with certain local political and ecclesiastical intrigues that find Grandier an ideal scapegoat . Despite agonized hours of torture , the priest denies that he is a diabolic instrument , but is burned at the stake anyway . <P> As performed at its world premiere by the venturesome Hamburg State Opera , the three-act music-drama is a lurid vision of hell on earth . Horror builds to a crescendo as sacral scenes of church and cloister are followed by wild orgies of the possessed nuns and a ludicrous exorcising ceremony in which the crazed sisters howl , shriek and twitch like wolverines in heat . Present in nearly every scene is a revulsive chorus of guttersnipes , beggars , epileptics and whores who leap and leer with a demonic joy reminiscent of Hieronymous Bosch . <P> Boos and Bravos . Penderecki scored the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 32 woodwind and brass instruments , 42 strings , an organ , harmonium , electric bass guitar and a diverse array of percussion instruments , including timpani and musical saw . Though it produces the now familiar range of Penderecki sound-semi-tones and quarter tones , tone clusters , glissandi and primitive knocking noises-the orchestra plays a secondary role to the chorus , which is constantly busy humming , singing neo-Gregorian chant , screaming , laughing , muttering and yelping . <P> Some critics complained that Penderecki had wasted an expense of talent in illustrating a bizarre footnote to history , and had failed to provide his opera with any sense of contemporary relevance . The audience response at the Hamburg premiere was a blend of boos and bravos , although applause predominated at a different production of the work in Stuttgart last week . Penderecki was unfazed . Is n't opera an archaic form for modern composers ? he was asked . " Only people who do n't have the brains to write one think so , " was his answer .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
