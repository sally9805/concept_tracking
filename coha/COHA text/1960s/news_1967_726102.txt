txt President Johnson advised Cons gress today that he was making an immediate consignment of two million tons of food grains to India . He asked for Congressional approval to send three million tons more , " provided it is appropriately matched by other countries . " In a special message sent to the Senate and House of Representatives , the President laid down the proposition that food aid to India or any other country without enough to eat was " an inescapable duty of the world community . " Rich and poor nations alike must join in the effort , he said , giving food if they have it , or capital , equipment and fertilizer . ' The first obligation of the community of man is to provide food fore all its members , " the President said . " This obligation overrides political differences and differences in social systems . The United States is prepared to do its share . " Shortage Is Estimated The Indian " food package " outlined by the President was predicated on a shortage of about 10 million tons this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other grains already in the pipeline , his proposal would mean a 6.6-millionton contribution from this country . The President estimated the cost of filling India 's 10-million-ton food deficit at $725-million . He valued at " nearly $150-million " the two million tons he was allocating immediately and asked that $190-million of Commodity Credit Corporation funds be used to finance the three million tons additional . There was no explanation for this apparent discrepancy in costs . Agreement ha Consortium The President also recommended an allocation of $25-million in food commodities for distribution by CARE and other American volunteer agencies in an emergency program in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh , states in India where drought has persisted . Under the President 's proposal , food aid would . be treated as part of assistance provided through the 10-member India aid consortium headed by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development , the World Bank . He said there was " substantial agreement " among the consortium members on these major points of the United States proposal : gIVIeeting food needs of Inida during this emergency should be accepted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gEmergency food and foodrelated aid should be coordinated through the World Bank consortium . 9This aid should not diminish the flow of resources for other development programs . It should be in addition to the targets for each country suggested by the World Bank . Although he could have made the immediate and future allocation of grain to India without asking Congressional approval , the President said he was requesting authority by joint resolution because the nature and scope of the issues made it " important that we act together . " The President noted at one point that the Soviet Union had contributed 200,000 tons of grain as part of an impressive effort to help India . Canada and Australia also have provided substantial amounts , and India had used her own foreign exchange to buy 200,000 tons . Administration officials estimated that two million tons would take care of India 's food needs approximately through June . They said this United States grain would be sold for Indian rupees . But a gradual shift to credit sales for dollars for at least a part of the three million additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March . Special emphasis was put on two related factors in the President 's message . One was fertilizer . The other was the necessity for effective voluntary population control in all countries lacking enough food to feed their . people . " We know that land can be made to produce much more food ? enough food for the world 's population , if reasonable population policies are pursued , " the President said . " Without some type of voluntary population program , however , the nations of the world ? no matter how generous ? will not be able to keep up with the food problem . " India 's avoidance of famine last year " ranks among the proudest chapters in the history of international cooperation , " the President said . She imported nearly 11 million tons of grain and used several million more from her own food reserves . This year , unless the country 's own production can be supplemented with the 10 million tons she is estimated to need " more than 70 million people will experience near-starvation , " the President added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Canada had been especially generous , as had Australia , which is not a member of the consortium . Simiarly , he said , the private contributions of the Dutch and Italian people had been especially heartwarming . " But the bleak facts require a substained international effort on a great scale , " the President said . " Today I propose that all nations make the new Indian emergency the occasion to start a continuing worldwide campaign against hunger . " Move Welcomed in New Delhi NEW DELHI , Feb. 2 ( Reuters ) ?
