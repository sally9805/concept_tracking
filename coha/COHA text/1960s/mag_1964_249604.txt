In economists ' terms , furniture has traditionally been a " postponable purchase " - people often put off buying a new chair , couch or bedroom set until the old one broke down , seldom bought on impulse . Lately , there has been a shift of sorts : Americans are inclined to trade in their old furniture somewhat sooner , buy more and more new furniture than in years past . Last week , at their annual summer show in High Point , N.C. , the seat of the industry , the nation 's furniture manufacturers puffed up their earlier predictions for 1964 . On the basis of a notably strong first half , they now expect their sales to rise at least 10% above last year 's $5.2 billion . <P> In a cluttered industry of some 5,000 manufacturers scattered through the U.S. , the four largest companies are the most comfortable of all . The big four-Kroehler , Bassett , Drexel and Thomasville-have made sales gains so far this year of 13% to 20% . Says Drexel Executive Vice President David J. Brunn : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hot and the economic climate will be good-both at the same time . That 's what 's happening to us this year . " <P> Changes In Quality . The general health of the economy has given people both the urge to buy and the money to do it with . Meanwhile , the tax cut has enabled them to pay off their old installment debts and take on new ones . The furniture business has been bolstered not only by changes in the quantity of U.S. personal income but also by changes in the quality of U.S. living . One major factor is that the U.S. is a nation of increasing mobility ; this year 9,500,000 American families will move to different homes , and most of them will discard at least some of their old furniture , buy pieces better suited to their new surroundings . <P> Homes are becoming bigger , too-nowadays , not many new houses have fewer than three bedrooms-and more rooms naturally require more furniture . The trend toward homes with patios and apartments with terraces has expanded the demand for outdoor furniture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of television . Says Chicago Retailer Milton Fish : " TV is keeping people at home more , and making them much more conscious of their furniture . " <P> Scrubbing the Borax . In the area of style changes , the furniture manufacturers are taking a lesson from the automakers : the American family spends an average of $100 a year on furniture v. $800 on cars and accessories . Now the furniture men have begun to shift styles more rapidly than usual to appeal to a nation of rising tastes . " Today 's American furniture buyer is interested in three things , " says Hampton Powell , president of Lane Co. , a major manufacturer . " He puts style above all else , with quality second and price third . "
