Nature 's most the equivalent of 200 trillion trillion 100-megaton hydrogen bombs . Swiss Astronomer Paul Wild has just added a new one to the stellar log-the first supernova seen from the earth in the unnamed galaxy N.G.C. 4189 in the constellation Virgo . <P> Since supernovae result from stars already shining for millions of years , the Latin term nova ( new ) is rather a misnomer that stems from Tycho Brahe 's 1572 naked-eye study of an exploding star in the constellation Cassiopeia . Ever since the irascible Danish astronomer- detailed his observation in De Nova Stella ( " Concerning the New Star " ) , scientists have been stuck with the term nova . <P> <P> Too Big to Live . Supernovae are the most violent of a group of three exploding stars whose two other members - novae and dwarf novae-periodically flare up for a short time and then return to their original state . By contrast , a supernova is never the same again . <P> A supernova 's own gigantic size is its undoing . Astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar calculated that a star whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not follow normal stellar evolution . Over a few million years , burning hydrogen on the outer layers of such a star produces more and more helium at its core . The doomed star 's interior shrinks rapidly ; and the density of its core increases . As temperatures rise in the contracting core , the collected helium is converted into successively heavier elements , such as iron and gold , which crowd the lighter elements outward . <P> <P> At this point , shrinkage accelerates , and the interior heats to about 5 billion degrees , suddenly converting the heavier elements back into the helium from which they were forged . The energy required for this reconversion comes from the only available source , gravitational shrinkage . When the energy demand becomes too great , the star collapses inward in a matter of seconds , producing such a titanic density that a matchbox full of the core material may weigh as much as 1,000 tons . Rebounding instantaneously from the collapse , the star explodes . <P> 800 M.P.S. Astronomers now believe that as much as one-tenth of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of light , and enters the earth 's atmosphere as cosmic rays . A second wave of slower radiation and burning gases causes the supernova to shine with prodigal splendor for weeks or even years until the star 's remains gradually fade . <P> Some gaseous remains survive long after . In A.D. 1054 , Chinese astrologers recorded a brilliant " guest star " supernova that suddenly exploded one night in the constellation Taurus . Located near the tip of the left horn , the star remained visible even during bright daylight . This same supernova 's remains can be seen today as the Crab nebula , a diffuse , glowing gas cloud 3,500 light years away , which continues to expand at 800 miles per second . <P> Less than 200 supernovae have ever been observed , and only three confirmed sightings have been recorded in the earth 's Milky Way galaxy . The last occurred in 1604 when Mathematician Johannes Kepler was credited with a find , and the next seems long overdue . <P>              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
