TIME Correspondent Murray Gart , who did most of the reporting on this week 's cover story , wound up convinced that discounting is here to stay , and that Eugene Ferkauf of Korvette 's is the most artful practitioner . He followed Ferkauf around for days , on his quick marches through his stores , with breaks only at stand-up lunch counters for a hot dog or a quick cup of coffee . Ferkauf was determined to give him an intense course in the theory and practice of discounting ; and because of Ferkauf 's relaxed way of operating , Gart soon found himself drawn into giving opinions . At one point , Ferkauf casually asked his views on some paper for a gift-wrapping department at the new Fifth Avenue store . Gart picked one , and Ferkauf promptly ordered : " Let 's try 5,000 ! " <P> After a few days of accompanying the boss on his restless prowl of every corner of his big stores . Gart lost five pounds , and says he has n't done so much footwork since he double-timed across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army in World War II . <P> IT used to be said that TIME brings all things , and though the slogan does n't turn up any more , the practice is still very much in fashion . <P> As we spread our forces each week to anticipate the direction of the news , we have three separate ambitions : to deliver not just a rehash of the conspicuous happenings but to have something fresh to add to them ; to spot in the unlikeliest places and widest variety of fields what is new , important and lively ; and to provide a coherency and shape that will increase the reader 's understanding of the random and complex events of the week . Three examples of what we try for in this week 's issue : <P> The Supreme Court 's ruling on prayers in New York public schools was the subject of sober editorials , ecclesiastical pronouncements and heated conversations-and universally over looked by all concerned was a crucial footnote in Justice Black 's majority decision . Quoted in " To Stand as a Guarantee " in THE NATION . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodly share of the U.N . ' s prestige is at stake in making the Congo regime work . Premier Cyrille Adoula tries hard , but thieves roam the streets , and some get jobs as ambassadors . See THE WORLD . <P> Apartheid ( apartness ) is one of the few Boer words any well-informed American is apt to recognize . But what it 's like is less familiar . And just why it applies to swimmers three miles out tells another side of the Africa story . Also in THE WORLD .
