Talk alone can not create prosperity-but is essential to it . Across the nation last week , the surprising business upturn - and where it would lead-was the subject of almost every businessman 's conversation . The usual optimists had a field day , the fence-sitters felt stirrings of commitment , and even the normally cautious allowed themselves a grunt or two of satisfaction . The sentiments of U.S. businessmen , from the corporate chief to the corner clothier , were captured by Wall Street 's Francis I. du Pont &; Co. : " The current upswing in business seems to have something for everybody . " Only six months ago many trendspotters had worried aloud about a mild recession in 1963 , but the 20 professional economists reporting to the semiofficial Business Council last week saw the gross national product rising 4% to $578 billion for the year . This was a modest forecast ; many economists anticipate a G.N.P . of at least $585 billion . At the semiannual meeting of the Council 's 100 leading businessmen in Hot Springs , Va. , Chief Presidential Economist Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the year , said that the Government might well " revise upward " its own official prediction of a $578 billion G.N.P . for 1963 . His hint : about $583 billion . Color Broadcast . In Detroit , auto producers predicted that car sales this month will crack last October 's alltime record of 728.552 . A few even dared to forecast that 1963 sales will top 1955 's historic high of 7,200,000 . Last month U.S. consumers bought well over 700,000 cars-more than Detroit managed to produce-and sales have been running 2,000 a day ahead of last year 's high rate . Steelmakers , now pouring at 82% capacity , look for shipments in May to be the highest in three years ; they expect June to be at least as strong , even though steel users have now conservatively bought up enough to hedge against an unlikely strike . RCA felt so roseate that it broadcast its annual meeting over closed-circuit color television in Rockefeller Center , and announced that profits are at records and that sales of color TV sets are 40% above last year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported record first-quarter earnings . So far this year , increased dividends have frequently gone hand in hand with better profit figures , including those reported by many of the big oil producers as well as by IBM , Nabisco and Lockheed Aircraft . Lift for Stocks . One dividend boost in particular stirred talk and buying on Wall Street . Reflecting record first-quarter profits of $414 million , General Motors last week declared a special 50 quarterly dividend on top of its regular 50 payout , which will add an extra $143 million to the pocketbooks of its more than 1,000,000 shareholders . G.M. stock jumped 45 points to 73 ? in the four trading sessions after the news-and lifted other stocks with it because many theorists hold that G.M. is a " leading indicator " for the entire market . The Dow-Jones industrial average rose 5.22 points for the week , closing at a 14-month high of 723.30 . Most important , brokers reported a rising number of small transactions-a heartening indication that Main Street is beginning once more to put its money-backed bets on the future of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
