Confidence surged last week through the U.S. missile program , which suddenly had a new hero : the Titan II , a radically new missile that moves the U.S. a giant step forward in space and nuclear effectiveness . Resigned to a series of test failures before they get a success , U.S. missilemen were jubilant when the giant Titan II climbed off its pad at Cape Canaveral on the very first try , lit its second stage exactly on schedule and flew a flawless course to the target 5,000 miles away . No big liquid-fuel rocket has ever scored such an immediate triumph . <P> Titan II is far more than just an improved model of the much criticized Titan I. During the development of Titan I , Aerojet-General , which built Titan II 's engines ; stored up dozens of new ideas for an advanced missile ; instead of dribbling them into the Titan I , it saved them for a brand-new missile . Titan II is considerably bigger ( 102 ft. high ) than Titan I or Atlas , has greater thrust ( 430,000 Ibs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer gadgets that can go wrong . Says Aerojet-General 's A. L. Feldman , technical program manager : " We got rid of all the garbage . Titan II is the simplest , most elegant and most advanced missile we 've got today . " <P> Moment 's Notice . What makes Titan II unique is a storable fuel that requires no lox ( liquid oxygen ) and enables the missile to be ready to fire at a moment 's notice . Lox , which is used in the Atlas and Titan I , is cheap and an efficient oxidizer , but its extreme cold ( - 297F. ) and its eagerness to boil away make it troublesome and unreliable . Instead of this chemical bad actor , Titan II uses nitrogen tetroxide as an oxidizer and a mixture of hydrazine and UDMH ( unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine ) as fuel . Both are liquids that can be stored for long periods at ordinary temperatures in the missile 's own tanks , require no last-minute transfusions of rebellious , bubbly lox . " This was really noticeable at Canaveral , " says Feldman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the lox right down to the countdown , but this time there was nothing we could worry about for the last two days before the flight . You preload , and that 's the end of it . " Titan II , like the much smaller , solid-fuel Minuteman , will be placed in underground silos covered with a thick lid to resist attack . After it gets the command to go into action , it can be fired in a few minutes , perhaps a few seconds . But since it is thin walled ( its liquid-fuel system enables it to use its weight elsewhere ) , it needs special protection from exhaust gases , which can contain shock waves strong enough to do it serious damage . <P> The solution : a new-type silo ( see diagram ) that will enable the engine gases to escape to the surface through W-shaped ducts leading away from the missile 's base . <P> <P> Hypergolic Ignition . Besides being storable , Titan II 's fuels are " hypergolic . " This fancy word , too newly coined to be included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning furiously as soon as they come in contact . No igniting system is needed , and this advantage eliminates a missile designer 's nightmare . Kerosene and lox , the commonest missile fuels , do not ignite on contact ; furthermore , if they do not burn promptly , they form a powerful explosive mixture that can blow a missile to shreds .
