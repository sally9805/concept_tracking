The lucky elite who can read Homer in Greek know that even the best translation is really a new version of Homer . His poetry can not be reproduced in English . Conversely , an old saying has it that every age must retranslate the classics in its own image-otherwise they die . Hence translation is a job for poets rather than linguists , for the task is to preserve the ancients ' spirit yet make it vividly relevant to moderns . <P> <P> Dryden did it for Virgil , Pope for Homer . A few living poets have recently produced such elegant efforts as Richmond Lattimore 's Iliad and Robert Fitzgerald 's Odyssey . But to four lively classicists at the University of Texas , who have just launched a pert quarterly called Arion , the field cries out for even zestier treatment . Arion has set out to banish the philological quibbling and fusty Victorian translations that have stupefied students for generations . Applying the verbal and visual techniques of Eliot , Pound , Joyce , Henry James and the movies , it aims to reawaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main dish of education . Arion clearly reflects the exuberant yet scrupulous hand of Co-Editor William Arrowsmith , 38 , translator in 1959 of the lusty Satyricon of Petronius . To many Arion readers , Arrowsmith 's version of Aristophanes ' rollicking Knights ' Prologue made the first issue worth its price ( $1.50 ) . Editor W. Robert Jones of the staider Classical Journal calls Arion " most provident in peril , courage and hope . " <P> Out last week was Arion 's even better second issue , with English Poet Christopher Logue 's new version of The Iliad 's Book XVI , which culminates in a bloody battle between Greeks and Trojans . Among Logue 's curdling visual effects : <P> His neck was cut clean through <P> Except for a skein of flesh off which <P> His head hung down like a melon . Or : <P> <P> As flies shift up and down a haemorrhage alive with ants , <P> The captains in huge masks drift past each other , <P> Calling , calling , gathering light on their <P> breastplates . And : <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he pitched downwards twenty feet , <P> Headfirst , back arched , belly towards the Greeks-who laughed-The tab ends of his metal kilt dangling across his chest . <P> <P> Whether it was the fall that scared him , <P> Or the vague flare that Patrolocus ' javelin made <P> As it drifted through the morning air towards <P> His falling body like a yellow-headed bird , <P> We do not know . Suffice to say he shrieked until , <P> Midair , the cold bronze apex sank <P> Between his teeth and tongue , <P> Parted his brain , pressed on , and skewered him <P> Against the upturned hull . <P> His dead jaw gaped . His soul <P> Crawled off his tongue and vanished into sunlight . . . <P> Aoi ! It was good to kill him !
