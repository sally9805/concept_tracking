In Mexico 's " guided democracy , " there is only one real political party , only one real presidential candidate.Against token opposition , the chosen man could win overwhelmingly without ever showing his face . Yet after 50 years of rule , the country 's all-powerful Institutional Revolutionary Party still strives mightily to keep its image bright and in its own uniquely Mexican way ask approval of the voters . Last week , on the eve of the July 5 presidential election , the sound of fiesta filled the land , and hardly a man who breathed could ignore the campaign . <P> Fireworks &; Flash Cards . From the looks of things , the P.R.I , might be fighting for its political life . The candidate is Gustavo Diaz Ordaz , 52 , government secretary in the Cabinet of incumbent President Adolfo Lopez Mateos . His neon slogans glow atop scores of Mexico City buildings ; they are whitewashed on hillsides , stone fences and adobe huts , strung across highways and back roads , plastered on thousands of homes , trees and cars . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legions before each Diaz Ordaz appearance . At the textile town of Puebla last week , trumpets shrilled and firecrackers exploded to signal his arrival . Past the screaming , cheering crowds he drove in a blinding swirl of confetti-first white , then green , then red for the colors of the Mexican flag . <P> At the city 's Ignacio Zaragoza Stadium , Diaz Ordaz made his way to the gaily draped platform . Facing him was a flash-card section of 2,000 people , flipping pictures of the President , then President-to-be . " Here , " he began , " here in this little homeland , I conclude this pilgrimage through all the parts of our great land . I began in Dolores Hidalgo , seat and beginning point of our independence . And I conclude it in the state of Puebla , because here Mexico ratified before the entire world its right , its desire and its capacity to defend that independence . " Then it was off to lay a wreath at a local monument , offer flowers at the shrine of a revolutionary hero , visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour the local newspaper office , appear at a meeting of the Women 's Council of Puebla , visit the Puebla University and finally dine with some P.R.I , big shots . " If we could only organize our industry this well , " said one businessman after the Puebla rally , " all Mexicans would be rich . " <P> Right &; Left . When 11 million Mexicans go to the polls , they will give Diaz Ordaz some 90% of their votes . On Dec. 1 he will take over from Lopez Mateos as Mexico 's President for the next six years . The lawyer son of a government accountant , he is tough and shrewd-with enough humor to smile at his unprepossessing looks . An able administrator , his politics are somewhat to the right of Lopez Mateos , who calls himself " left within the constitution . " As government secretary , Diaz Ordaz crushed a 1959 railroad strike and arrested its leftist leaders ; he jailed Mexico 's top Communist ( and top artist ) David Siqueiros on a charge of " social dissolution , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
