When Hungary became the first Communist state to sign an agreement with the Vatican last September , it seemed as though the country 's 6,000,000 Roman Catholics had regained some small but significant freedoms . Then Communist Boss Jnos Kdr ordered his security police to get on with enforcing his regime 's real policy toward religion : implacable enmity . If proof of that policy were needed , the Budapest Municipal Court has just supplied it with the trial and conviction of 13 priests on transparently flimsy charges of conspiring against the Communist system . <P> <P> Subversive Catechism . Their crime was the " ideological destruction " of Hungary 's youth by teaching about Christ , possession of letters written in French about church music , and of such subversive literature as the Catholic catechism . Their sentences : from 2 to eight years ' imprisonment . <P> Chief defendant was Father Lszl Emdi , 45 , former rector of Budapest 's Regnum Marianum Church , which was razed by the Reds in 1950 to make room for a huge statue of Stalin . Emdi was first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but was later amnestied . Now he must serve out the four remaining years of his earlier jail sentence as well as five more years for his latest " relapse . " Also convicted : Father Alajos Werner , Hungary 's leading composer of religious music , who several years ago attended a congress of church music in France . He was given 2 years in prison after the latest trials . <P> The courtroom dialogue sheds a revealing light on the quality of Hungarian justice : <P> Defense Counsel : The defendants are priests , and religious instruction is their priestly duty . It was not political work . <P> Judge : These arguments are incorrect because we are living in a society based on materialistic concepts . In our society , educating youth in the religious spirit amounts to politics . <P> Defense Counsel : And other priests ? Why are they allowed to teach religion ? <P> Judge : The law guarantees freedom of religion , and the teaching of religion is allowed by our proCommunist peace priests . But nobody can expect the state to entrust these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sworn enemies of the state . <P> <P> Arrests &; Asylum . Kdr presumably got some propaganda mileage out of the Vatican pact , which allowed Pope Paul to appoint six Hungarian bishops of his own choosing . Hungary 's leader has given little in return . Though some Hungarian bishops have again been allowed to visit Rome , several hundred priests are still forbidden to officiate at holy services . With one minor exception , religious orders are outlawed . Two bishops are under house arrest in Hejce , and two others are banned from their dioceses . Hungary 's most famous symbol of opposition to Communism , Jsef Cardinal Mindszenty , who is now the only Catholic leader of his rank in Communist Europe still barred from the duties of his office , remains in secluded asylum in the U.S. legation in Budapest . He will not leave , he has always insisted , until freedom for his church becomes a reality .
