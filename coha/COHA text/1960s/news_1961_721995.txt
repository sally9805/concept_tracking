txt The House and the Senate passed tonight foreign aid bills that were completely at odds on President Kennedy 's long-range development loan program and the means of financing it . The Senate granted the President 's request for authority to borrow nearly $8,800,000,000 from the Treasury over five years to finance the loans . The President regards this provision as the core of his program . The House version denied the President this authority . Instead , it authorized an appropriation of $1,200,000,000 , the amount that the President had asked for economic development loans for the first year . This would mean that the President would have to get future funds through the annual appropriation process . 13 Democrats Opposed The vote in the Senate was 66 to 24 . Eleven Republicans and thirteen Democrats voted against the bill . All but one of the opposing Democrats , Senator Alan Bible of Nevada , were Southerners . Forty - six Democrats and twenty Republicans voted for the bill . The House vote was 287 to 140 . One hundred ninety-five Democrats and ninety-two Republicans voted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted against it . Both houses authorized appropriations in excess of $4,000 , - 000,000 for the various aid categories . Originally the President asked for $4,762,500,000 , including the Treasury-borrowing authority . The Senate Foreign Relations Committee cut the request by $436,000,000 ; the House Foreign Affairs Committee cut it by j$407,000,000 . House Accepts Changes The House made only minimal reductions from the committee recommendations . The Senate cut $250,000,000 from the $1,800,000,000 proposed for military aid . It also cut $800 , - 000,000 from the $8,800,000,000 requested in Treasury-borrowing authority , at the rate of 3200,000,000 a year over the last four years of the loan program . Conference committees of the two chambers will attempt to reconcile the differences . Yesterday President Kennedy urged the House to reverse the vote of Wednesday that stripped the bill of both the long-term approach and the Treasury-borrowing provision . The amendment had been offered by Representative D. S. Saund , Democrat of California , a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee . Mr. Saund is a naturalized citizen born in India . Governor Rockefeller of New ' York reinforced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican urging the defeat of the Saund amendment on a roll-call vote just before final passage . The Saund amendment originally passed by a vote of 197 to 185 . The hope of some Democrats was that the amendment could be defeated on a roll-call by a narrow margin , and that then some Republican internationalists would move to recommit the bill to committee with instructions to bring back a specified compromise . They hoped that such a compromise would authorize a three-to-five-year loan program with annual appropriations . This is what the internationalist Republicans originally wanted , and many Democrats believed the Administration would accept it . But all these hopes fell apart during the day when it became apparent that all factions stood to lose much and gain little by risking a roll-call . Democratic leaders discovered after repeated counts that they could not corral more than 180 votes against the Saund amendment , five fewer than they had Wednesday . This would have meant a humiliating second defeat and would have impaired the Administration 's bargaining power when the two versions of the bill went to a House-Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were quite happy with the Saund amendment as it was were not eager to risk a possible defeat by a last-minute switch of some internationalist Republicans and Southern Democrats . Finally , the internationalist Republicans who would have preferred a long-range program financed by annual appropriations did not want a roll-call either . If the Saund amendment were defeated and a compromise were also lost , then they would be left with the Administration 's original five-year bill with Treasury borrowing . In this situation , both the Democrats and the internationalist Republicans believed that it would be better to go to conference with the Saund amendment and hope to get a good compromise acceptable to the House . Difficult Task Ahead The Administration 's task , it was agreed tonight , will be made more difficult because the House version is diametrically opposed to that of the Senate . Some Democrats were hopeful that the President would still be able to get a two-year or threeyear loan program with Treasury borrowing . However , many leaders in both parties and some Administration officials thought it doubtful that the Treasury borrowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference report provided for Treasury financing , the House might refuse to accept it . They recalled that in 1957 the Senate accepted and the House rejected President Dwight D. Eisenhower 's request for a three-year loan program financed by Treasury borrowing . Therefore , it was widely believed that whatever bill finally went to the White House would authorize a loan program for several years to be financed by annual appropriations . It was also predicted that the bill might contain a strong statement authorizing the Executive to make long-term commitments , as distinct from binding obligations , with every reasonable assurance of future appropriations . Sharp RepBei to Rockefeller With such a statement , it was held , the President would be able to convince the underdeveloped nations that Congress supported the objectives of a long-range program , even if it was determined to maintain its control of the purse . On one thing virtually all House Republicans agreed today , that Governor Rockefeller had done his cause no good by his telegrams . Many supporters of the Saund amendment sent sharp replies to him , telling him either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And those Republicans who agreed with his viewpoint believed that he had put them on the spot and had done a disservice to his ' own political ambitions . Under an agreement that permitted an hour 's debate on each amendment , the Senate plowed doggedly ahead all afternoon . It took the following actions : 41Rejected , 45 to 43 , a proposal by Senator Styles Bridges , Republican of New Hampshire , that would have banned aid to any country that knowingly exported arms or strategic materials to Soviet bloc countries . 9VOted down , 66 to 24 , a proposal by Senator Jack Miller , Republican of Iowa , to withold aid from any country that was more than two years behind in its dues or assessed payments to the United Nations . ilApproved , 74 to 15 , an amendment by Senator Ernest Gruening , Democrat of Alaska , to fix the interest on loans made by recipient countries with United States aid . The re-loan rate was fixed at no more than the interest charged by the United States on its loan , plus 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " amendment . Earlier the Senate had rejected an amendment to fix the re-loan rate at 8 per cent . gRejected , 51 to 40 , an attempt by Senator Karl E. Mundt , Republican of South Dakota , to tack on to the bill a one-year extension of Federal school aid to the so-called impacted areas , those with large concentrations of Federal personnel . The House was embroiled most of the afternoon with the so-called Communist amendments . By voice vote it agreed on a flat ban on assistance to the Cuban Government of Fidel Castro and approved a denial of aid to any country helping the Castro regime unless the President decided that such aid was in the national interest . The House also turned down , on a 212-to-102 non-record vote , a proposal to bar aid to any nation voting for the admission of Communist China to the United Nations . The House approved an amendment naming the ComImunist countries that should be denied aid . The list included Yugoslavia and Poland , both of which receive aid now .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
