THE AGE OF MALAISE ( 203 pp. - Docia Maraini-Grove ( $3.95 ) . <P> Adult amazement at the wayward bussing and bedding of today 's youth is worldwide . But it expresses itself differently in different regions . In the U.S. , a land flowing with milk and sociology , it has induced oleaginous teenage columns . In Europe , where literature is still thought to have a lingering relevance to life , it has resulted in a whole writing genre , as often as not penned by the troubled and troubling young themselves . <P> France 's Franoise Sagan is the most famous example : at 18 , she coolly chronicled how a girl grows up by driving her prospective stepmother to suicide ( Bonjour Tristesse ) . In Le Rempart des Beguines , Belgium 's Franchise Mallet-Joris , at 20 , documented a listless daughter 's love affair with her father 's mistress . The trend may have reached a climax with The Age of Malaise , a novel about a teenage girl in Rome written by Dacia Maraini , 25 . Awarded the $10,000 Formentor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book itself , the novel has now been released simultaneously by 13 publishers in 13 countries . <P> Everything happens to Enrica . The man she loves is a perennial student who had his way with her three years before , when she was only 14 . He calls her to his room from time to time , but only to gobble her up like a biscuit Tortoni and turn back to his books . A love-struck lad from her typing class enjoys her in a muddy construction shack . A rich lawyer picks her up with his big car one night and performs titillating lathery rites with her in his fancy bathroom . Her mother dies of lung cancer . Her father , who spends his time designing unsalably ornate bird cages , loses their apartment , and Enrica has an abortion . <P> Is this a portrait of youthful existence in Italy ? It seems unlikely . As a case history , the trials of Enrica are both too relentless and too bizarre to be convincing-even though they are recounted with a grimly detailed , laconic realism that echoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The single achievement of this slight book is the girl 's character . A victim who refuses to act like one , a survivor who survives because she does not try to justify life , a pitiable figure untainted by self-pity , Enrica has a kind of stoic charm . Not for export to the U.S. , of course . The sociologists would ply her with group therapy . In a few weeks she would be blaming Dad for rejecting her , and tearfully reciting her laments to peer-group pals whose lives can be blighted by a back-seat rebuff on a blind date .
