At National Heroes Cemetery , outside Djakarta , the coffins of the six slain generals were draped with the red-and-white colors of the Indonesian flag . Twenty tanks lined the approach road , and an honor guard in bright berets stood at attention . Antiaircraft guns pointed skyward , evidence that the army top brass still does not trust the air force , which has been behaving ambivalently . <P> As a crowd of 10,000 looked on , General Abdul Haris Nasution , Defense Minister and Commander of the Army , hobbled forward on crutches , supported by two aides . Nasution had been a prime target of the assassins and had broken an ankle in his escape . His five-year-old daughter Erma was shot and killed . " We living witnesses know that you were upholding truth and justice , " said Nasution , addressing the dead . " In our heart you are the heroes . We believe that the truth will win . " <P> Special Orders . The truth is hard to find , especially in Indonesia , where confusion is a way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . them all . Still unresolved last week was whether the six generals were martyrs slain by Communist-supported plotters or whether they had been killed by Lieut . Colonel Untung and his palace guards to prevent their launching a coup of their own . <P> Those who suspect a direct Communist role recall that about two weeks before the Sept. 30 coup , Djakarta 's Reds began preparing a foundation of some sort . Editorials in Communist newspapers , which had long grumbled about the soaring cost of living but never pressed for remedies , suddenly called for " immediate action , " and their campaign against " capitalist bureaucrats " was abruptly stepped up . A few days before the coup , Communist cadremen were issued special orders , and some were given arms . Top leaders were told not to sleep in their homes for a few nights . When the coup came , the official Communist paper came out flatly in support of the uprising . <P> Yet many an old Djakarta hand is convinced that the Reds were not the masterminds . For one thing , Untung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would expect from efficient Communist Party Chief D. N. Aidit . With 3,500,000 members , plus his large and increasing influence on Sukarno 's policies , Aidit was doing well enough as things were . <P> Strangely Defensive . One theory is that there actually was a plot by the generals to take over control and put an end to the growing power of the Communists . It gains color from the fact that Sukarno did not even appear at the funeral of the slain officers . Next day , as Sukarno called his Cabinet into emergency session at his summer palace in Bogor , Nasution did not show up-but two Communist ministers did , along with Air Force Chief General Omar Dani , a Communist sympathizer.
