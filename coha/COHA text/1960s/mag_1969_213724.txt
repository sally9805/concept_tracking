Elaine May is a corrosively perceptive satirist with a mean comic punch . Her off-Broadway one-acter Adaptation , the first of a double bill completed by Terrence McNally 's Next , makes one laugh till it hurts , partly because the ache of recognition is in every line and situation . She has the wit to see that if Pavlov 's dogs salivated at the tinkle of bells signifying food , modern man is not so very different . He salivates at psychological flash cards marked Emotional Maturity , Identity Crisis , Making a Commitment , as well as at traditional cues for action such as Education , Work , Love , Marriage , Family , Success . <P> The play is cleverly staged like a TV contest game . The game , of course , is life , and the unflinchingly ironic viewpoint of Adaptation is that life is a game played on as well as by the contestant . The four actors play many roles : parent , child , teacher , psychologist , husband , wife , in a fiendishly swift journey through the seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contestants hop from one huge checkerboard square to another . A games master indicates roles , crises and situations , and penalties or bonuses are meted out . The play is a running spoof on psychoanalytical jargon , which has become the emotional pidgin English of the day . <P> The humor is as contemporary as the minute hand on a watch . For example , the hero is about to enter college . His father asks him what he intends to major in . The boy replies , " Hotel management , " since he dreams of running his own hotel . The father says that he too had had a dream , that of owning a liquor store , but it had never come true . He cautions the boy that he must be realistic and have something solid to fall back on . Replies the boy : " I 'm minoring in cinema , Dad . " <P> Miss May has apparently been majoring in stagecraft . As the neophyte director of her own play , she shows herself to be an accomplished pro , with a crisp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero who plays the adaptation game from birth to death , she elicits a performance that is laugh-and letter-perfect . Expressions cross his face like clouds scudding across the sky : hope , bewilderment , apprehension , chagrin , humiliation , and wild fleeting moments of joy . It is the year of the loser , on and off Broadway : Dustin Hoffman in Jimmy Shine , Woody Allen in Play It Again , Sam ( see below ) . Gabriel Dell is the most endearing loser of them all . The rest of the cast act with infinite finesse to make Adaptation coruscatingly funny . <P> Draped in the Flag . While Terrence McNally 's Next does not have quite the dazzle of Adaptation , it , too , is richly comic and McNally 's best play to date . At an antiseptically bleak Army induction center , a potential draftee ( James Coco ) appears for his physical examination . He is fortyish , fat , balding , and obviously the victim of some computer error . Nonetheless , his examiner ( Elaine Shore ) , a squat female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manual , proceeds with the examination . In a sequence of mounting hilarity , the thoroughly discomfited Coco is forced to strip down . The apex of comic modesty is reached when Coco tries to avoid total exposure by draping himself in the American flag .
