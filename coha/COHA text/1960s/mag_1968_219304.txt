" It is possible that my retirement at this time might help to ensure the prospect of more normal university operations during the coming academic year . " It was not only possible but probable that Grayson Kirk was indulging in understatement when he announced his retirement last week after 15 years as president of Columbia University . For as the start of the new term neared , Kirk 's defenders and detractors alike agreed that if he remained on the job , his very presence would provide an excuse for continued controversy on the restless campus . <P> Since Kirk will be 65 on Oct. 12 , and eligible for retirement pay , it was understandable that he talked of his decision as a routine step . The timing , he suggested , was a matter of convenience to all concerned . But the fact is that Columbia does not make retirement mandatory at 65 , and Columbia 's trustees accepted Kirk 's resignation even though they have not yet settled on his successor . Apparently divided over whether the retirement would seem too much of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nearly four hours behind closed boardroom doors . But in the end it was obvious that the student uprising had , indeed , forced Kirk 's departure . <P> To run the university until a new president takes over , the trustees chose Andrew W. Cordier , dean of Columbia 's School of International Affairs and veteran U.N . official . At 67 , Cordier is even older than Kirk . He made it clear that he does not want the top job permanently . <P> Fund Raiser . At his farewell press conference , Kirk insisted that he was " not interested in what anyone thinks about my victory or defeat , but only in the welfare of this university . " Indeed , the rancor generated by last spring 's student rebellion and some 800 arrests has tended to obscure Kirk 's lasting contributions to Columbia . After taking over from Dwight Eisenhower , he created six institutes in which scholars from many fields studied selected regions of the world , built up a science faculty that won four Nobel Prizes , set top scholars to work on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer science to urban planning . A more effective fund raiser than administrator , he attracted enough money to complete $70 million worth of new buildings and push the annual operating budget from $22 million to $136 million . He had almost reached the halfway point in the university 's current $200 million fund drive , and will stay on as president emeritus to finish the job . <P> Kirk 's troubles stemmed from an utter failure to develop rapport with any significant section of the faculty or student body . He did not recognize the yearning for change within his own institution . Controversy became inevitable as he allowed relations with the surrounding Harlem community to deteriorate and brashly involved the university in backing an unproven cigarette filter . He tended to shrug off all criticism of Columbia 's ties with military research , failed to perceive the extent of faculty and student discontent early enough to deal with it , and finally called in the police to regain control of his campus .                 @ @ @ @
