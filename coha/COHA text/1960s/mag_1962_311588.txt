For in years , ocean racing 's most famous trophy , the America 's Cup , has been gathering dust in the New York Yacht Club , waiting for a foreign challenger to win it away from the U.S. The British have tried 15 times , the Canadians twice . Their combined efforts have cost at least $25 million , and all have failed . Last week another nation threw down a challenge . Along the banks of the Parramatta River , outside Sydney , throngs of excited Australians cheered the launching of a sleekly handsome 12-meter yacht that may give U.S. sailors their sternest test yet . <P> Rigid Security . The design for the Australian challenger came from the board of Alan Newbury Payne , 40 , a maverick Sydney naval architect whose failures ( an overrigged 12-ft. skiff , a 35-ft. cutter that wallowed badly when winds dipped below 25 knots ) just about balance out his successes . To turn out the first 12-meter yacht ever built Down Under , Payne shrugged off recurring hepatitis , worked 60 hours a week for two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boat 's full specifications . But her 30-ton weight matches that of such U.S. 12-meters as Vim and Columbia ; so do her 11-ft. 10-in. beam and her 70 ft. of overall length . The yacht 's decks are of Canadian cedar , overlaid with waterproof blue fiber glass . Her hull is of Honduras mahogany , covered with six coats of white paint , decorated with a thin gold stripe and the five stars of the Southern Cross . Her sails , tailored from light blue Dacron , range in weight from oz. per sq . yd. ( for the spinnakers ) to 6 oz. per sq . yd. ( for the mainsail ) . <P> Slightly fuller-bodied amidships than Vim , the new challenger has a " knuckle " or sharp upward turn on her bow , designed to reduce weight by eliminating overhang . Her floorboards are hollowed out , her fittings are cast of light-weight aluminum or alloys , and some metal parts have been drilled full of holes . Her cockpit floor is purposely curved to provide the helmsman with level footing when the boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature is a simplified mainsail control-a single wire , attached to a three-speed gearbox that Payne admits could cause a " chaotic situation " if it jams . <P> An Awful Spot . At week 's end the svelte Australian challenger was still berthed at the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron , awaiting christening and preliminary sea trials . Sydney wags suggested the name Spectre , an unkind play on the Sceptre . Britain 's roundly trounced 1958 challenger . But the syndicate of Down Under businessmen ( a newspaper magnate , an oilman , a tobacco tycoon ) who had shelled out $700,000 to build her were optimistic about her chances against the U.S. next September . Said Syndicate Chairman Sir Frank Packer : " The Americans have had the cup for so long that when they give it to us. it 's going to leave an awful spot on the sideboard . " Designer Payne was more cautious . " I do n't know what we 've got yet , " he said , " and I wo n't know until we go sailing . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
