txt SAIGON , South Vietnam , Aug. ** strategists are making detailed plans for placing a sizable United States military force into the Mekong River delta region of South Vietnam Although the delta has been relatively quiet militarily for months , American planners feel it serves as the primary source of rice , tax money and conscripts for the Vietcong and must be denied them if the war is to be won . The delta is a difficult region to master . Neither the Japanese nor the French were able to make much headway there when they tried . Even in the dry ? season its land mass is laced by 2,500 miles of inland waterways , which more than double in volume in December after the heavy monsoon rains . A New Approach No American combat units serve now in the mangrove swamps and rice paddies of the delta , although United States advisers assist the three South Vietnamese divisions and related ' units stationed there . Because of the difficult terrain , the American military command foresees the eventual use of wholly new tactics , units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be a number . of APB self-propelled barracks ships for , use in delta operations . The vessels , modified tank landing ships , will be heavily armored and will carry about a ' hundred troops each along heavily defended stretches of waterways . The Marine Corps is writing a new book of tactics for its // operations in the delta . It is not certain yet whether the Marines or Army units will be selected for the new mission . ? By one reliable estimate , it would take roughly 100,000 men to handle the job . The United States now has about 286,000 troops in Vietnam and it is widely believed that the figure will rise to more than 400,000 by the end of this year . Current military thinking calls for three types of related operations in the populous delta , whose eight million people constitute more than half the population of South Vietnam and produce more than 80 per cent of its rice . These are the plans : 1 . Amphibious landings would be staged from the sea against key coastal complexes long used by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to transship rice and arms to comrades eleswhere along the 1,500 miles of South Vietnamese coastline and to recruit and train new guerrillas . MarineNavy beachheads , once secured , would be slowly expanded both along the coast and inland . 2 . The armored , heavily armed APB ships would be used for swift thrusts well inland against guerrilla base camps and supply depots and would help other smaller , faster , less well armored vessels patrol the rivers and canals , which are the Vietcong 's main travel arteries in the delta . 3 . Quick strike forces , equipped with large numbers of transport helicopters and supported by jet fighter-bombers , would attack concentrations of guerrillas . By blocking rivet escape with the APB 's , planners say , the copter-borne troops should be able to pounce on enemy build-ups and crush them . With the right tactics and equipment , the presence of many waterways might serve for the first time in the war as an obstacle to the enemy , hindering rather than facilitating his retreat . " If we are going to defeat the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planner said , " One good way is to make them hungry . " A North Vietnamese regiment requires about a ton of rice a day . They ca n't transport the necessary volume down the Ho Chi Minh Trail from North Vietnam or even in from nearby Cambodia . They must depend on local supply . Their main granary is the delta . " He said that in South Vietnam 's five northernmost provinces , which make up the I Corps area , short food supplies had forced the enemy several times to send foraging parties out of their mountain strongholds . Four times in June , he said , the North Vietnamese sent out parties of battalion size or larger in search of food . Each time they were spotted by Marine or South Vietnamese units and badly mauled , he said , " If hard pressed , the enemy can fight with rocks , but not without food , " he declared . Another source said the deltE does n't send much rice to Saigon any more . The Vietcong , hi said , collect taxes from many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for transship ? ment to their forces all over South Vietnam . " We 've got to disrupt thi Vietcong control of the vil ? lages , " he said . " For too long they have been free to collect taxes , food and fresh recruits . '
