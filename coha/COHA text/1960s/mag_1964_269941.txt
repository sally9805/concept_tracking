Among the 2,020,000 European immigrants who have poured into postwar Australia , fully 260,000 have been Italians , mostly from Calabria and Sicily . The newcomers added much that is welcome Down Under , from pizza and pasta to espresso bars and truck gardens . But as Melbourne last week was shaken by the shotgun explosions of gang warfare , Australians became aware that the new Italian immigrants had also brought with them the blood feuds of the Mafia and Camorra , as well as the code of silence induced by omerta ( death for informers ) . <P> Rear Window . At stake was the overlordship of Melbourne 's bustling , 16-acre Victoria Market , beneath whose iron-roofed sheds are crowded the stalls of 800 produce growers and 200 agents . Work in the market starts at 2 a.m. as trucks roll in with produce from Victoria , New South Wales , Tasmania and Queensland , and the stalls fill with a babble of Mediterranean tongues-Italian , Greek , Yugoslav-as well as Australian-twanged English . Trading is almost entirely in cash , and an estimated $45 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . <P> The struggle for power began in December 1962 , when Marketeer Domenico Italiano , 65 , known as Il Papa , died peacefully in bed . One strong contender for the job of Mr. Big was eliminated four months later when Vincenzo Angilletta was ambushed outside his home and blasted to death by both barrels of a shotgun . Last November , Domenico Demarie , 41 , got the same treatment , but he survived as a sick and frightened man who swears he has no idea who attacked him or why . Fortnight ago , Vincent Muratore , 43 , rose before dawn to go to his wholesale produce stall at the market . He got as far as his car when someone fired through the rear window , killing him instantly . Two days later , Truck Gardener Antonio Monaco , 39 , was gunned down outside his shack . <P> Dapper Throngs . Melbourne 's Italian-language newspaper Il Globo accused Victoria Market racketeers of all the shootings and prophesied that " the next victims will be at Muratore 's funeral . " At St. Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a Capuchin 's robes , lay in a $1,575 casket with silver fittings , surrounded by floral offerings . Throngs of dapper Italians wearing black ties , dark tight-fitting suits with tapered trousers , and black pointed shoes escorted their wives in deep mourning . In a building opposite , Melbourne police focused binoculars and telephoto cameras on the 200 cars that made up the funeral procession . The man who is said to be the next candidate for assassination is wealthy Wholesaler Frank Madafferi , who attended Il Papa 's and Muratore 's funerals . " Let them come and get me , " snapped Madafferi , then added , true to the omerta code , " All I know about these accidents and the Mafia is what I read in the newspapers-and I ca n't either read or write . "
