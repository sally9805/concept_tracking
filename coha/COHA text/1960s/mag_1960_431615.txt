 | LeTourneau : The Matz Who Moves the Earth @# NEAR Longview , Tex. , the other day an automobile driver came smack-dab against an irrigation ditch in his path . The . ditch was three feet across and six deep . " Think I 'll jump the car over it , " said the driver . " If you do , " said a companion beside him , " you 'll do it alone . " He got out . The man at the wheel backed off , threw the car in gear , and charged at the ditch . He expressed no surprise when he made it . The man was Robert Gilmour LeTourneau . Everybody knows the name . It 's painted prominently on the world 's @#  | biggest wheeled vehicles , in use practically everywhere .

Another kind of LeTourneau machine ? jumbo-size , naturally ? stands spread-legged in Texas tideland salt water and the Persian Gulf to serve as halfacre platforms for oil derricks . A modification of this machine is to be used to build a bridge across the strait connecting the vast lake of Maracaibo and the Gulf of Venezuela . Bob LeTourneau probably has done more singlehandedly to alter the looks of the world 's topography with mechanical tools than anyone else in history . Jumping the car over the ditch was typical of him . It was 41/2 miles to the nearest bridge . He was in a hurry . He adopted what was ? to him ? the simplest @# and quickest solution to the problem .

His associates say he 's a mechanic 's mechanic . That 's more like it . LeTourneau is a natural , self-taught mechanical and electrical engineer , touched with genius . He quit school at 14 . Today , at 71 , he is more than a towering personality in his field of manufacture . He is also one of the last of the industrial titans , a special breed of men who fought their way to riches by sheer shrewdness , stamina , and imagination .

The Panama Canal and the Suez were big because they were measured with teams of mules and a hand shovel . " He proves it . His jungle crusher will knock down 1,300 tall trees , each a foot in diameter , every hour . The machine was built for it . It 's 76 feet long , 25 feet wide , 19 feet tall , and weighs 150 tons . It can fell trees five feet in diameter , too . They just take a little longer . Known by his thousand-odd employees at his Longview and Vicksburg , Miss. , manufacturing plants as " The Old Man , " and to his intimates as " Pop , " LeTourneau is no easy man to work for .

Deeply religious and a lay preacher , each year he flies 100,000 miles ? half of his total air travel ? to appear at church gatherings . His jungle-clearing projects , called missionary-industrial enterprises , are nonprofit . Rolling his own . LeTourneau 's manufacturing empire , though modest in size compared with many corporate giants , is complete .

POPULAR SCIENCE described his welding methods more than 18 years ago ? in January , 1942 . For the same reason , he forges , rather than casts , the huge gears that drive and maneuver his behemoths . LeTourneau machines rarely wear out . The years just outdate them . Today 's LeTourneau empire , comprising 11,500 acres at Longview alone , got started quite by accident . Forty years ago LeTourneau was an earth-moving contractor . He did n't like the equipment available . Tractors had to pull scrapers . His machines had to keep going back and forth to move a given amount of dirt from here to there . Tractor-plus-scraper proved clumsy , hard to maneuver . LeTourneau began thinking of a better way to move earth . Why not scoop up dirt in a big bucket and tote it from here to there instead of moving it with a blade ? It would be far faster .

While he was coining money in a makeshift manufacturing plant , he kept losing his shirt on earth-moving contracts . Almost consistently underestimating the hardness of the rock he would encounter , he was always only a short step ahead of foreclosure . One job that almost broke him was building the road from Boulder City , Nev. , to Boulder ( now Hoover ) Dam . Turning point . One day he took stock of himself . He quit moving earth and started making earth-moving machines . That , and a fat contract with Henry Kaiser , was the turning point in his fortunes . He kept improving his equipment . @#  | Each machine goy r . An idea haunt .. : him . It reposed in one of those collapsible drinking cups that people took on picnics . The cup was simple .

In time the separate tractor disappeared . The power unit became integral with the buckets . Sizes kept going up ? bigger buckets , more dirt . In 1953 one of the country 's great corporations came around waving a lot of folding money in his face . He succumbed . He sold out his earth-moving machinery business for $31,000,000 . And promptly went back to his drafting board . He had an idea for a new whopper . Three-corner rig . Oil companies were building offshore platforms ? for drilling rigs ? by a slow , painful , expensive process of sinking foundations and then putting on superstructures . There had to be a simpler way . LeTourneau designed a triangular platform that floated . On its three corners he attached great steel legs that moved up and down on gears driven by electric motors . His platform was towed to the drilling site . Down went the legs . They found bottom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all 9,000,000 pounds of it , above the reach of waves . Because there were three legs , a touch of a motor switch leveled the platform . " Dry " hole ? Just pull up the legs and float the platform to a new location . Critics snorted . They subsided , though , when the LeTourneau platform was the only one in the Gulf of Mexico , among many in operation , to ride out the 1957 hurricane Audrey with no more damage than loss of paint . Oil companies in Italy and Saudi Arabia are now using LeTourneau three-legged platforms . The contract with the company that bought out LeTourneau 's earth-moving machinery business specified that he could n't turn a hand to making that sort of thing for five years . For five years @# @#  | and he was 64 years old , an age when most men retire ? he fretted , explodi with ideas .

At that time he had adapted the motors from old electric automobiles He put eight of his new electric whet is on an earth-moving rig . Each whet worked . Their efforts were equalized despite differences in traction caused 1 , y different footings . The reason : An electric motor , by its nature , draws power in direct proportion to the effort it 's called on to exert . Simple , eh ? Competitive companies are now adopting the idea . Charmed life . At 71 , LeTourneau is a tall , husky , slightly stooped , and bald man with eyes that miss nothing . He limps a bit , favoring his left leg . He lost half his left hip many years ago in an automobile accident that killed five other persons . Danger , like that he faced in jumping his car over the ditch , seems to be an abstraction to him .

For years his wife Evelyn has bought all his clothes . " How do you like your new suit ? " she asked him not so long ago . " What new suit ? " he responded . She could only sigh . He had it on . He says he does his best thinking in an airplane or during his regular Sundaymorning two-hour soak in a hot tub . He used to draw his ideas for new machines with a stick in the dust of his driveway . Now he has more dignity . He draws them on the backs of old envelopes . The LeTourneaus live in what may be the least pretentious multimillionaire 's house in the world .
