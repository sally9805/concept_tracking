txt In the short run , the outlook for the Czechs is very bleak , but in the long run , the outlook for the Soviet Union and its political system is even worse . The men in the Kremlin can bully and betray an ally , but this squalid business in Prague is not a sign of Soviet strength but a dramatic confession of moral and political weakness . There is nothing new in the Soviet habit of treating human beings as things . They established the state on the totalitarian principle that the people were the mere instruments of power and ambition . But for a long time the Soviet leaders believed their system would work and win the allegiance of the people . Now they know it wo n't . The Fear of Freedom The competition of even a little freedom was too much for them . The Communist regime in East Germany could not stand the attractions of liberty and prosperity in the West . They thought the natural human impulse for individual liberty might spread from Czechoslovakia through all of Eastern Europe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communist empire . So they acted , not out of confidence but out of fear . No doubt they will achieve their immediate objectives in Czechoslovakia . They will find a few Quislings . They will show us how to get " order , " if not law or justice . They will control the press and muffle dissent in due course , but the decay of decency and the defiance of good faith are so plain that even the Communists elsewhere in the world are divided and dejected . It is interesting that the Soviet experts in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow do not think this invasion was primarily a victory of the Kremlin hard-liners over the Kremlin liberals . They believe most of the leaders in Moscow were alarmed by the East German Government 's report that the liberal Czech leaders could not or would not control the Czech movement toward individual liberty and expression . The parallel with the Hungarian rebellion of 1956 is not exact . Hungary was determined to leave the Communist security system ; Czechoslovakia was not . Dubcek wanted to liberalize the lives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and work out his own brand of Communism along Yugoslav lines . It was not Dubcek 's politics that worried Ulbricht as much as Dubcek 's ideas , and the East German leader 's report apparently led to the Kremlin decision to move . A ' Hasty ' Decision ? Moreover , the evidence of a hasty Kremlin decision is fairly plain . The Soviet leaders were not ready with a puppet government . They knew where to get the members of the Czech general staff and soon had them in control , but the tank drivers actually got downtown in Prague and had to ask their way to the television station . The Soviet Ambassador , Dobrynin , not only saw President Johnson before the tanks were in Prague , but was careful to emphasize that the action was an " internal " Communist matter , taken at the request of the Czech Government . This , of course , was a lie , but the Ambassador 's explanation of the invasion as an act of " defense of the Communist system " was probably the truth . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more to the old spheres of influence system . Moscow claims the right to smash any movement toward multi - party democratic government in Eastern Europe . Washington claims the right to act against any serious move toward a Communist government in this hemisphere . And China feels the same way about the establishment of any U.S. base of operations in Vietnam or Korea or anywhere else on the continent of Asia . Spheres of Influence The United States Government , of course , rejects the division of the world into spheres of great-power influence , but it claims one for itself and recognizes the fact , if not the theory , of a Soviet sphere in Eastern Europe . For that reason it will limit its countermoves to diplomatic protests , and Prague will eventually become an obedient Communist satellite . Even so , it will not be true that " world opinion " will be meaningless . The weakness of the Communist empire has been exposed . It is going against human nature and especially against the spirit of the rising generation , and in the long run Prague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the spirit of freedom Moscow is trying to smother .
