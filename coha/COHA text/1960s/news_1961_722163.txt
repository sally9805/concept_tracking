Tenney as a result of a survey of procedures and the need for reforms . Mr. Tenney 's report was made public by the Mayor . The program was seen as a move to avoid further bribery scandals such as those that have arisen in recent years in several departments , including Markets , Buildings and Water Supply , Gas and Electricity .
