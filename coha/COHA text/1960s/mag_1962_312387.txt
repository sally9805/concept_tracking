A SIGNAL VICTORY ( 224 pp. ) - David Stacton-Pantheon ( $3.95 ) . <P> <P> David Stacton 's sourly excellent historical novels are like chess games of long-dead masters , replayed from dusty notes . The author moves the pieces for both black and white , knowing the outcomes , musing on strengths and weaknesses unseen by the players . It is to catalyze these dark musings , not to commemorate the players , that Stacton restages the old battles . Not surprisingly , his novels lack the painted scenery and speeches in all-purpose King James dialect that clutter other historical fiction . In A Signal Victory , the ironically titled tale of the Spanish conquest of the Maya civilization , there is not a line of dialogue . The book 's most vivid presence is that of Author Stacton , brooding in mordant aphorisms about the uses of power . Everything is stated in epigrams , and he can drop the material for an evening 's argument into an apparently offhand phrase such as : " Like all fanatics , he thought in negatives . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare rewards . Without 400 pages of cutlass work , the invading Spanish are contemptuously summed up : " They knew nothing of navigation . That they left to the Portuguese . When there was something to shoot , they shot it . When there was nothing to shoot , they prayed . " The author admires the doomed Mayas , the soft , proud , cruel , devious fanciers of blood sacrifices . It is a measure of his skill that he persuades the reader to admire them , too . <P> At the book 's focus is a dim figure from history , a Spanish renegade named Guerrero , who tried to shake the Maya princes from their fatalism and organize resistance to the invaders . The enigma of Guerrero is not fully resolved at the book 's end ; he is a less complete character than that other Stacton enigma , the Pharaoh Ikhnaton of the brilliant On a Balcony ( TIME , Sept. 6. 1959 ) . The trouble may be that philosophical novelists are , in their weakest moments , tract-writing zealots . Stacton 's message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men is how to die with dignity . But in his eagerness to give his hero a suitable death , he has neglected to bring him credibly to life .
