The revolt against LBJ but neither did he say that he would campaign , or , for that matter , run any risks . Consider the sorrows of Democrats in dissent . Typically they were young , educated . politically naive and dedicated to ending a war they truly despised . But the system . the American way . allowed them no rational avenue of protest . When at long last Eugene Joseph McCarthy stood up . measured the perils and bravely declared . the Dump-Johnsonians became manic . " What gives me hope . " an experienced California politician said . " is the true nature of Gene McCarthy . I 've spent time with him and . believe me , he has John Kennedy 's inner toughness with Adlai Stevenson 's great feeling for the world . " The man , who had known McCarthy for several days , was sincere and moved by his own words . " He 's going to win , " the Californian said . " and the first thing we have to do for him is drop that phrase ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we now stand for something positive . " Dump-Johnson it was and Dump . Johnson it remains , because every- ) thing in the embittered Democratic Party situation today proceeds from the most unusual happening in the Icing and unusual career of Lyndon Baines Johnson . Elected to the White House by the largest popular margin in history just 40 months ago , Mr. Johnson has since become the least popular incumbent President since Herbert Hoover . A reporter attempting to ascertain the nature , the number and the competence of dissenting Democrats is constantly sidetracked into discussions of the object of dissent . The party pros want to talk about President Johnson I " bul. uh . do n't use my name " ) . So do bellhops , cab drivers and schoolteachers . On a recent trip through more than half a dozen states , one reporter found that most Democrats were not violently opposed to Mr. Johnson  --  but almost nobody strongly supported him . These days no Democrat , amateur or professional , seems to say , as Democrats proudly said of Kennedy and Truman . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hears in California , " At least he 's better than Nixon . " In Illinois someone says . " We 're stuck with Johnson but it could have been worse . " In New York it is , " He does have a certain feeling for the people . " An Iowa Democrat goes to great pains to explain what difficult work it is " being President of a country the size of this . " Everywhere the praise comes hard . Mr. Johnson 's most resolute public defenders would now appear to be Dean Rusk , who coincidentally is defending the programs of Dean Rusk . and Hubert Humphrey , who , friends report . looks drawn . The fervor lies with the dissenters . Their complaints resound and accumulate until one fills four notebooks and Lyndon Johnson has been made to appear a national catastrophe . They are angry at him for three basic reasons : his handling of the war in Vietnam ; his supposed mishandling of domestic aft airs , speci fically the urban crises ; and the style that is the man . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggravates them . Democrats are not certain what to do about Vietnam , Since Franklin Roosethe United Nations and NATO . A Democratic President ordered the intervention in Korea . For a time , Vietnam was palatable to many Democrats as an extension of the general policy of American overseas commitment . No longer . To most liberal Democrats . the war demands American energy that should he spent at home ; or is ever more pointless , or is too brutal . or has taken us too close to nuclear holocaust . The liberal consensus is that we are in trouble in Vietnam ; the liberal consensus says that it was Lyndon Johnson who got us there . The domestic issue proceeds from the war , or at least the military demands on the U.S. budget . With $24 billion of his budget invested in the war , Mre Johnson has not been able to afford promised measures such as the national health centers , or adequately to fund the variety of programs against poverty and pollution . His Great Society is stillborn . liberals feel ; they suggest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counseling . He is Farmer . Teacher , Union Man , Lawyer , Physician and finally  --  he may well like this position best  --  a modern Wotan , the sorely beset Father of Us All . None of these roles seems to have taken . The great body of Democrats understand that one President in his time plays many parts , but they find that this President 's acting is not quite believable . Particularly among liberal Democrats , Johnson 's style produces expletives of disgust . Many of those Democrats who worked hardest to defeat Barry Goldwater speak of Johnson 's " betrayal . " One Californian says quietly . bitterly . that a Republican friend recently approached him . " You remember what you told me in 1964 , " the Republican said . " You told me if I voted for Goldwater , a lot of bad things would happen . You said the Negroes would riot in the streets and we 'd have half a million men in Vietnam . " " Yeah , " the Democrat said . " Well , 1 have to confess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Goldwater and you were right . " Snow fell on Washington in the morning of Nbverrlher 30. 1967. 1 t fooled the weather forecasters and snarled a city that likes to think of itself as southern . Around the Capitol'the snow lay unplowed , and a mean , wet wind sprang up . Inside , Eugene McCarthy , in a gray suit , was standing before marble pillars in the Senate 's vaulted Caucus Room He was telling reporters what they had known he would tell them for perhaps a week . " I intend to enter the Democratic primaries of Wisconsin Oregon , California and Nebraska , " McCarthy said . speaking softly , almost diffidently . " My decision to challenge has been strengthened by recent announcements out of the Administration , the evident intention to escalate the war and the absence of any indication of a compromise . " Still quietly , Gene McCarthy began to itemize the cost of the war in Vietnam as he sees it : " The physical destruction of a small nation , One hundred thousand civilian casualties ? , The fracturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , over 15.000 combat dead and nearly 95.000 wounded ... A monthly ex-penditure of between two and three billion dol-lars .. The failure to appropriate adequate funds for the poverty program here The drastic reduction of our foreign aid elsewhere .. A danger . ous inflation A deepening moral crisis ; discontent , frustration Alienation from politics , particularly on college campuses . A tendency to withdraw in frustration or cynicism . . . " McCarthy said that he intended to take the is sue of the war before the people of the United States . He was not for peace at any price " but for an honorable , rational and political settlement to the war . " Were there any questions ? It was not a rousing statement . Perhaps a press conference with its essential pitting of wary protagonist against cynical antagonists , precludes rousing statements . At any rate , McCarthy 's spontaneity and genuine wit did not show until he fielded questions . " Sir , do you have enough money to run ? " " In most campaigns a candidate spends two thirds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't have to do that . " " Has n't the Administration sought the rational solution you suggest and offered to meet with Hanoi ? " " To suggest a meeting anytime anywhere , " McCarthy said , " is not an offer . An offer would be Let 's meet next Tuesday morning in Warsaw . " " Do n't you believe , " a woman reporter asked . " that we should stop Communism ? " " Yes , I do , " Gene McCarthy said , " and South Vietnam is the worst possible place to try . " " Sir , are n't you committing political suicide ? " He gave a small smile . " It wo n't be a case of suicide . but it might be an execution . " " Oh . " another woman reporter cried through the laughter . " Is n't this going to be fun ? " Beyond , the urbane humor there was a lot of work to be done . Where some campaigns open with martial trumpets and rolling drums , Eugene McCarthy 's began with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon , and wires of support began arriving , but no senator announced support for Gene McCarthy and of the 248 Democratic Congressmen only Don Edwards of California announced that he was in favor of the dissent . The pros were not getting involved and a Gallup poll would presently show that 58 percent of a sample tested had never heard of the new candidate . Excitement . however , was predicted for Saturday . December 2 , in Chicago . Harold Ickes Jr. , earnest , tousle-haired , the last son of Roosevelt 's Old Curmudgeon , promised it . So did Al Lowenstein. the New York attorney who had helped organize the occasion , a gathering dig called the Nal smal Conference of Concerned 1 ha noc ts . By self-definition a LrniCerneil Democrat was a registered party member who opposed I he war in Vietnam . Some SOD of them , well groomed , middle class , polite , paid their own way to Chicago and to the Sheraton-Blackstone Hotel where , 19 years before . Harry Truman began the give-'em-hell campaign that defeated Thomas Dewey . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat slow . The Concerned Democrats waited for the cars with patience and minimal profanity . They were also waiting for their candidate . Eugene McCarthy landed at O'Hare Airport at 12:55 on Saturday and walked right into the middle of an unscheduled press conference . He does not rattle easily , and after answering a few questions he moved through a small crowd toward a waiting limousine , pausing to chuck a baby under her chin . He spent the afternoon talking to caucuses of four primary states , Massachusetts , New Hampshire , California and Wisconsin . " I 've decided to add your state to my list , " McCarthy told the Massachusetts caucus I the state 's regular Democrats had just voted to support Johnson ) . " Will you make the announcement now or would you rather wait ? " Afterward McCarthy walked across the street to the Hotel Hilton , where he was to answer questions from the Concerned Democrats en masse . Was he going to drop out for Bobby Kennedy ? " I f Kennedy moves , we 'll have to see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no conspiracy between us , no collusion , no common plan . " What about support from militant groups ? " This group is militant enough for me . " How about the black militants ? " I 'm indifferent to color , " McCarthy said . It was going well ; by the time of the pre-dinner cocktail party , the Concerned Democrats were telling themselves that something exciting was happening , something without historic parallel . " You can almost hear the birth pangs , " Donald Peterson of Wisconsin said in metaphoric confusion . Theodore White , who quadrennially writes a hest-seller called The Making of the President , walked through the cocktail party and was immediately acclaimed as a harbinger . " The Making of the President , ' 68 , " a delegate said . " That 's what 's happening here . " The heady mood fed itself , and delegates , employing superlatives better saved for Hamlet . began to recall the ringing speech McCarthy had made in nominating Adlai Stevenson in 1960 . Rea ! excitement was seizing these people . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now they had found a man of parts who seemed to need their support . When McCarthy walked into the delegates ' cocktail party at 5:45 , portable spotlights fixed on him . and men bearing small TV cameras closed in . McCarthy is a big man who hasplayed a lot of hockey , He moved strongly among the people , his pale face looking blood less under the cruel l ights- moving , smiling , clasping hands and saying several times , " No , thank you . I do n't need a drink just now . " People 's eyes shone as they spoke to him . He was gentle and attentive , and as he left , the spotlights going dim , there was general agreement that Demosthenic oratory was likely for the evening , when McCarthy was going to accept the convention 's endorsement . Two thousand people crowded into the grand ballroom of the Hilton to hear him , and perhaps 4.000 others milled outside , angry at being denied admission by the Fire Department . The band in the ballroom played Happy Days .4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! until someone remembered that as Hello . Lyndon the song was a smash around the White House . A trumpet note was the last to die . The crowd was young and heavily academic . Mike Wallace of CBS considered the delegates and pronounced , " No money . " " Oh , yeah ? " said a well-dressed delegate . " I 'll show you twenty millionaires in ten minutes . " Soon Allard Lowenstein called for order so that he could introduce Senator McCarthy . It was probably not the biggest moment in the life of Eugene McCarthy . but it certainly was the biggest moment for Lowenstein . While the senator stood in the rear of the ballroom , waiting to make his way to the podium . Lowenstein spoke on and on . " We are not trying ; to beat somelmaly with nnbody , " he shouted . " We 're trying to beat nobody with somebody . " Cheers . " Get this strain:an about Lyndon Johnson . If a man cheats you once , shame on him . But if he cheats you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say we 're trying 10 lick Goliath with David . Well , who the hell do they think won that one ? " More cheers . The style was rough , reasonably effective and totally uncongenial to the mood of Gene McCarthy , who was standing with his head bowed , his strong hands held before him as if in prayer . When Lowenstein was done , 15 minutes later , McCarthy went to the podium and quickly read through his prepared speech . He told the delegates that the Dreyfus case in France indicated that a society can not accept a single injustice without spreading corruption . The war in Vietnam is an amalgam of injustices . He told them what the Punic Wars had done to Rome . Even though the legions were victorious , Roman society was so disrupted by the wars with Carthage that it was never able to recover . The republic fell and then came the Caesars . Vietnam could be our Punic War , Unlike Lowenstein , McCarthy did not attack Lyndon Johnson , nor did he raise his voice . He did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished was briefer than when he began . Someone asked him later why he had not been more galvanic . " At this stage of the campaign , " he said , " what would you have me galvanize them to do ? " The New York Times buried the speech on Page 42 , in a single column lost among pre-Christmas advertisements , A day later the Times gave better space to a harsh political analysis . Then the syndicated Evans-Novak column reported that McCarthy was in trouble . Another reporter wrote that he was " flat . " McCarthy may have been upset by the amateurism he found about him in Chicago . But he did not expect a functioning machine , and he is not given to panic . He had found a small forum . a starting place . He is not running in the manner of John F. Kennedy . He does not shuttle about in a private plane , preceded by advance men and accompanied by troops of speech writers and press agents . For the first week of his campaign his only " organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convention , he began to build , but very slowly . He apioniited Blair Clark , a former associate publisher of the New York Post , as campaign manager , and Tom Page , a tweedy Californian , as press secretary . He opened a campaign headquarters . But anyone looking for the Gene McCarthy organization still would have encountered difficulties . It existed , but barely He maintained indifference to financial matters . Money was pledged  --  perhaps $750,000 ? and more was available " from many old Kennedy and Stevenson sources . " But McCarthy campaigned with a rural penury reminiscent of EstesKefauver 's . Two days after the convention , neither a triumph nor a disaster , McCarthy spoke at Temple Emanuel in Great Neck , N.Y. , a prosperous suburb with an informed and generally liberal population . He arrived without retinue . His speech there , a paid lecture in a series called The Image of Man , drew a full house of 1,200 people . In this setting , standing before bronze emblems representing the 12 tribes of Israel , candidate McCarthy had an effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlined four new civil rights that , he suggested , had developed in modern ?  - -  America . " Running through all , " he said , " is the right of every man to be free from public disgrace . " McCarthy 's first new civil right was " the right of a job , employment or decent income . " This right has been established by our mastery over our economic system , he said . His second civil right was education , " not just for the most talented , but for those that are least talented , the mentally retarded and the handicapped , so that they can become more fully human . " The Constitution did not mention education , McCarthy said , because when it was adopted the need for education was limited . A third was the right to health . " We have moved too slowly in this respect , but we are coming to understand that even the mentally ill have a civil right to the best treatment possible . " Finally he addressed himself to the right to decent housing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can live free from threats on his person , and also free from poisons in the air and in his food and water . " Job , education , health , housing , " McCarthy continued . " may always have been human rights . but now we see them as civil rights ; something thought . They responded with extended applause and with a confusion of ques-tions , submitted on cards and read aloud by the temple 's rabbi , Dr. Avraham Soltes . " Was n't erring on the side of generosity what America did during Hitler 's rise ? " the white-haired rabbi read from one card . " No , " McCarthy said . " We should have responded earlier than we did . but by the time we really got around to noticing him , we were n't able to do anything about it . " " I understand , " Rabbi Soltes read from a card , " that you once studied to become a Benedictine monk . How has this training influenced your political philosophy ? " McCarthy smiled his small smile . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep death daily before your eyes , which never hurts in politics . " Behind the laughter McCarthy shifted hack toward seriousness . " I do n't think spending a year in retirement and meditation ever does anyone harm . I suppose I 'm the only member of the Senate who knows what the eighth degree of humility is . They say the last degree of humility is very close to the ultimate in pride , in the same was that the pale horse of death and the white horse of victory are virtually indistinguishable . " He had another eloquent night in Minneapolis later that week . This time he made fun of the Johnson Administration , At campaign time . McCarthy said . Johnson was going to send Dean Rusk to campuses " to provoke demonstrations . " McCarthy remembered being in the White House one night when General Khanh 's government was the hope in Vietnam . " We 've really put one together now , " Dean Rusk announced . " This one really looks good . " That was about 9:30 in the evening . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " Now . " McCarthy told the Concerned Democrats of Minnesota , " if you take into account the time lag .... " He was partisan in his home state and aroused . The mood of America now was " joyless , frustrated , anxious . " The language of American politics under Lyndon Johnson had become infested with the word " war . " There was a war on poverty . war on inflation , war on ignorance . " But you do n't solve these problems , " McCarthy cried . " with the techniques or the devices of war . " But we do have one real war , " he said sadly . " One war that is all too real . " He had a specific plan for getting out . If we abandon certain territories , stop bombing the North and suggest a specific negotiating time and place , Hanoi would come to the conference table- " Every Democrat is called on to make a hard and difficult judgment about a hard and difficult war . The Republicans wo n't do it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . We have to make this judgment without fear . without seeing specters , We have to be willing to stand up and Is counted . " He drew bravos from people . Soon afterward he was going to go to New Hampshire to see about the primary there . ( He regarded it a hawkish state ; nevertheless , he decided to enter . ) Later on , perhaps , he would fly to Vietnam . His campaign had not caught lire , bul he had not intended it to burn early . We had a private talk in a hotel . The senator was sitting at a desk in his room ? not a suite  --  at the Plaza in New York . The night before he had attended a fund-raising dinner and had refused to participate in a " tandem press conference ' ' with Bobby Kennedy , He sat in shirt sleeves , looking more rested than he was , a big , sensitive man with a tine-featured face , who has the splendid political skill of talking to you as though no one else in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I could take my notes more comfortably , and began to talk about his family and his youth . His father was in the livestock business in Watkins , a Minnesota community of 500 or ( 300 . His grandfather had been a teacher . " Everyone assumed that I 'd go to college , " he said . " It was expected . I went to a Benedictine college , St. John 's . Minnesota was a fine state , without class distinctions because everyone arrived at about the same time . The Methodists went to Hamline . The Presbyterians went to Macalester . The Norwegian Lutherans went to St. Olaf 's and the Swedish Lutherans went to Gustavus Adolphus . We were ecumenical way ahead of our time . The state was influenced by co-ops and a genuine communal feeling . Certain reforms were made in the Catholic Church in the 1930 's and interfaith conferences frequently went on , I majored in English at St. John 's and played hockey . It was a good place to go if you were alert and open . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a Masters at Minnesota and married an intellectual girl named Abigail Quigley . They have four children now . Moving toward the doctorate , he taught in high schools and colleges . He became a member of a liberal group that successfully purged the Democratic-Farm-Labor Party of Communist influence . He was chairman of sociology at the College of St. Thomas in St. Paul at the time of his election to Congress . I asked about Bobby Kennedy , and he said , " We try to keep in touch , but I 'm my own man . I 'm raising an issue . I do n't need his support . It 's not as if I were scrounging for delegates . " He was sunk in a deep hotel chair , quite relaxed . " Wo n't Johnson start a vendetta against you ? " " That 's not his way , " McCarthy said . " His way of eliminating people is to let ' em die on the vine . He wo n't waste time in the name of vengeance . " Once they were close . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gene McCarthy , " the President has written , " is one of those uncommon men who puts his courage in the service of his country . He 's the kind of man  --  as we say in the ranch country of Texas  --  who will go to the well with you . That 's a homely way of saying you can count on him in dark days or bright ones . " McCarthy grinned . " I 'm still a good man to go to the well with , but not to a wasteful war in Vietnam . " He said he did not think all was yet ost . " We have to turn our Asian policy around , or at least blunt the thrust of it . If the war stopped tomorrow , we 'd be five years or more getting out , but we have n't passed a point of no return . " " Ca n't your move wait , then ? Do n't you think we can survive another four years of Johnson ? " " If I were sure of that , " McCarthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . He talked about the system then ? " It " It s possible that the Amr ecan political ystem does not work " ? and about certain poems and poets . " It is good to read poetry , " he said , and not impractical . I suggest it is impor tant to have read Sandhurg , as well as the Tribune . if you presume to understand the city of Chicago . It is important to have read Allen Tate 's Ode to the Confederate Dead , as well as the speeches of George Wallace , if you presume to understand the South . " He recalled some useful lines from a poem by Robert Lowell : " The Republicans can not sink and will not swim . " And he spoke of Dylan Thomas , a wild , glorious Welsh bard , who tried to drink all Scotland dry and failed and died . " Near his end , Dylan Thomas said immortality now mattered less to his soul than did the deaths of his friends . " McCarthy sat up straight . " My own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less to me than the deaths of other men . " The movement that McCarthy heads is outside the central structure of American politics . and because of this it appears foredoomed to failure . One Democrat who opposes the President has concocted a fantasy that 1 goes like this : Gene McCarthy wins in New Hampshire , Wisconsin and in Massachusetts . He sweeps Nebraska and Oregon in May , and California in June . These victories persuade principal Democrats that Lyndon Johnson can only lose . Together governors , senators and congressmen plead with the President to step down . So with a tear in his eye and a Stetson on his head , L.B.J disappears into the sunset beyond the Pedernales . Then either McCarthy , who deserves it , or Bob Kennedy . who wants it , wins the Democratic nomination . De-escalation , withdrawal , peace . Fade out . But it is only a fantasy . During a television " chat " with three network reporters . the real Lyndon Johnson haughtily dismissed the " Kennedy-McCarthy " movement as the machinations of ambitious men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's first reaction to McCarthy 's announcement was rage . Whatever else he may be , Lyndon Johnson is a fighter . Pressed , he does not quit . He intends to battle the Dump-Johnson movement with all the powers of his office , all the resources of his party and , one suspects , with his fingernails and teeth . This makes the movement a desperate long shot  --  appealing , possessed of purity , but in the end , perhaps , just one more testament to the desperate times in which we live .
