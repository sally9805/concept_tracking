To many , the lowly cafeteria is a symbol of soup-line shabbiness . So what happens when it is spruced up with classy decor , white-jacketed waiters and tasty food ? In the case of Mobile-based Morrison Incorporated , the resulting high costs hold profits to a thinly sliced 40 a meal . Naturally , the company has to compensate for that with volume . One of the nation 's fastest-growing cafeteria chains , with 57 branches in seven Southeastern states ( and six more due to open this year ) , Morrison 's serves up 2,000,000 meals a month , has tripled annual sales over the past dozen years to $47,284,000 . <P> To explain Morrison 's success , President J. Herbert Gibbons , 53 , characterizes it as " a cafeteria that thinks like a restaurant . " He might have described it as a cafeteria that thinks like a conglomerate . Over the years , Morrison 's has branched into fields ranging from coffeemaking to insurance , with the result that noncafeteria operations accounted for 27% of last year 's profits of $1,885 , - 000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company takes over Memphis-based Admiral Benbow Inn , Inc. , which operates a chain of 15 restaurants and ten motels . <P> See the Boss . Such expansion has characterized Morrison 's ever since it opened its first cafeteria in a Mobile relief hall in 1920 . Named after Co-Founder J. Arthur Morrison , an Alabama restaurateur who had seen a cafeteria in Denver and brought the idea South , the business caught on so fast that three more branches were opened within a year . Anxious to avoid the dreariness that afflicted so many other cafeterias , Morrison 's employed waiters to carry the customer 's tray to his table , also set most of its serving lines out of sight of the dining areas . The idea , then as now , was that cafeteria dining can be respectable , a notion advanced by the company 's current advertising claim that " you might see even your boss at Morrison 's . " <P> Though no two Morrison 's cafeterias are decorated alike-motifs can vary from French colonial to classical Roman-menus , portions and prices are the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chain sticks to such bestselling staples as roast beef , chicken and fried shrimp , specifications for which are detailed in a six-inch-thick recipe book called " the Bible . " With an IBM computer keeping close tabs on supplies and customer preferences , Morrison 's holds losses from spoilage and leftovers to a scant 2% . Similar precision governs food display : on the serving line , such higher-profit extras as shrimp cocktail and strawberry shortcake always come first , on the theory that hungry customers are most apt to buy them before they get their meat and potatoes .
