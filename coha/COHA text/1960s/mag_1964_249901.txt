LITTLE BIG MAN by Thomas Berger . 440 pages . Dial . $5.95 . <P> Deer sir I hurd you was trying to fine me-I reckon its me you was trying to fine on account I never hurd of ennybody else among these here old burned out wrecks at this home who was ever a hero like myself and partipated in the glorus history of the Olden Time Fronteer and new them all Genl Custer , Setting Bull , Wild Bill , etc or went through the socalled Little Bighorn fight or Custers Last Stand . <P> I am being held prisoner here . I am One Hundred and 11 year old and if I had my single acton Colt 's I wd shoot my way out but I ai nt got it . Being your a riter and all I will sell my story for 50 Thousand dollar which I figure to be cheap . <P> In this fashion , Author Thomas Berger introduces Jack Crabb , who surely must be one of the most delightfully absurd fictional fossils ever unearthed from the Olden Time Fronteer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglected hero in the history of this country or a liar of insane proportions . " Crabb , in fact , is both , which is just what Berger intended him to be . As relived by Crabb in Berger 's telling , the legends and the romanticized history of the West are comically disassembled , like Hamlets seen from backstage . Typical is Crabb 's meeting with Wyatt Earp . " You just spoke my name , " says the skinny stranger . " I do n't know your name , " says Jack . " It is Earp , " says the stranger . " Oh , " says Jack , " what I done was belch . " <P> Wild Bill Hickok appears as the sort of feller who loved to talk about guns with the expertise of an Ian Fleming . " Now then , about that S &; W you carry , " said Wild Bill . " It is a handsome weapon , but the shells have a bad habit of erupting and jamming the chambers . I 'd lay the piece aside and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thuer conversion . " Crabb reports that Hickok knew an hombre who carried a small pistol in his crotch . When cornered , the fellow would ask permission to relieve himself before dying , open his fly , and fire . " The trouble was one time he got overhasty and shot off his male parts . " <P> Betwixt and between , Berger-Crabb is a spellbinding storyteller with a fine feel for frontier manners and morals and for fascinating Indian lore . And why did n't the Sioux scalp Custer ? Jack Crabb knows ( because he was there ) : Custer was getting bald .
