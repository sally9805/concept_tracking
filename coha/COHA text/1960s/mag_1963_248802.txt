Aberdeen , a typical prairie town in South Dakota , had seen nothing like it since the introduction of the ring-necked pheasant turned the town into a hunter 's paradise . Telegrams poured in , including greetings from the President of the U.S. and Senator Karl Mundt . Newsmen , radio and TV crews were everywhere . St. Luke 's Hospital swarmed with guards trying to control the unusual traffic . The quintuplets born to Mary Ann Fischer , 30 , wife of a billing clerk in a wholesale grocery , were thriving , and the town was afire with pride . <P> New Washers . Hastily christened by Bishop Lambert A. Hoch while they were still on the critical list , the quints seemed well past most of the dangers of prematurity last week. * Her pallor heightened by fright and emphasized by a blue robe , Mrs. Fischer submitted to a round of predictable nonsense when the hospital held a press conference in its crowded basement cafeteria . " Would you like to have five again ? " The answer was blunt and honest : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivery room again than come down here . " <P> Husband Andrew Fischer took over and was asked his recipe for successfully raising five children . " The most important part of the bringing up , " he said , " is a good wife . " Then he went home and made an understandable bid for privacy by having his phone cut off . <P> But there was no slowing the celebration down . Gifts for the Fischer babies flooded Aberdeen . They ranged from cattle feed for the cows that Andrew Fischer now milks by hand for his five older children to baby shoes and a fur-trimmed coat for Mrs. Fischer . Through its chamber of commerce , Aberdeen decided to build a $100,000 house for the Fischers . And as the loot piled up , Income Tax Boss Mortimer Caplin reminded his agents that all such unsolicited gifts , for which the Fischers performed no service , were taxfree . But taxes would be due on a $75,000 Saturday Evening Post contract for short-term magazine and TV rights . <P> Fast Film . Doctors studying the birth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been only one entirely new principle available for their care since the birth of the Dionne quints in 1934 : potent and selective antibacterial drugs ( sulfas and antibiotics ) were on hand to guard against infection . <P> But at every step there were refinements and improvements in more familiar medical techniques . The X ray which first showed Dr. James A. Berbos that Mrs. Fischer was bearing a fivesome was taken with high-speed film developed since World War II-safer for both mother and babies . The light anesthesia used during delivery was better controlled and adjusted . Doctors now know that the right oxygen concentration for preemies is around 40% . And the five little Fischers were promptly placed in five Isolettes , incubators developed in 1948 to give automatic and precise control of temperature , humidity and oxygen strength . There they will stay for a while before graduating to the open air-and , in about two months , to that big new house that the town is building for them . <P> <P> * Equally thriving : Venezuela 's Prieto quints , still in Maracaibo 's University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
