WRITER BY TRADE : A PORTRAIT OF ARNOLD BENNETT by Dudley Barker . 260 pages . Atheneum. $6.50 . <P> <P> At the time of his death at 63 in 1931 , Arnold Bennett was the ruler of Britain 's literary roost . He was not only the author of 70-odd volumes of novels , plays and other assorted pieces , but the one literary critic in London whose Olympian deliberations ( in the London Evening Standard ) were regarded as absolute gospel . <P> Whether Bennett himself was a good or bad writer was a judgment that his sometimes awed , often contemptuous contemporaries were never able to make . Partly it was because his physical presence was so overwhelming . He was a strutting cockatoo of a man , resplendently tailored , grey hair swept up into a crest , wit as sharp as a honed spur , manner as crude as a clod . Fascinated by the combination of the baroque and the bumptious of the man , Rebecca West once wondered if it would not be better to judge Bennett as a character rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly with Fielding , or Dickens , or Balzac , " she said , " but he could be compared with Squire Western , or Mr. Micawber , or Lucien de Rubempre . " The posthumous publication of parts of his own remarkable million-word Journal , moreover , only added to the popular caricature of him as a fop , a snob , and a frightened little poseur hiding behind bombast and a vulgar cocksureness . <P> <P> Slum Child . But the author of Anna of the Five Towns , The Old Wives ' Tale , the Clayhanger trilogy and Ricey-man Steps was also a superb storyteller and a literary innovator , a Dickens shorn of romanticism . By imposing on the sentimental Edwardian fabric the realistic techniques he had absorbed from such French masters as Goncourt , Flaubert , Maupassant and Turgenev ( whom he insisted on calling French because it was in that language that he read him ) , Bennett became the first popular novelist of his time to tell of the actual lives of recognizable people in words that ordinary readers could understand . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Biographer Dudley Barker shows , was a dedicated and gifted literary craftsman . He wanted to write good books , and make money - in that order-and he forever respected and tried to improve his art . As a young writer , he set himself the task of producing 1,000 words a day , and for most of his 40 productive years he somehow managed to maintain that rate . <P> Bennett was a child of the Midland slums , the son of a domineering and ambitious pawnbroker father who eventually became a fairly prosperous solicitor . Handicapped by a stammer that in childhood made him jerk epileptically and bite the air , he grew up painfully shy and covered his shyness with the show-off 's mantle . He was as frugal as a ragpicker , carefully kept a record of each shilling tip , constantly worried about money . <P> Master Nagger . Although he married at 39 , and lived with his wife for 15 years , Bennett was neither a happy husband nor a good one .
