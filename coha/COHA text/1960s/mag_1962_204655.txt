Sing me a song with social significance . <P> All other tunes are taboo . . . <P> It must be tense with common sense Or I wo n't love you . <P> The curtain raiser does not even come close to reflecting the sentiments of today 's musical comedy . But even in their own livelier era , the lyrics were part of one of the most improbable musical hits ever to reach the stage-the 1937 show , Pins and Needles . Produced by the International Ladies ' Garment Workers ' Union , P. &; N. opened with an amateur union cast in Manhattan 's 300-seat Labor Stage Theater , and to the garment workers ' astonishment , it ran for four years . Now , once again , it seems to be a surprise hit . Columbia has brought out a 25th anniversary recording of the show 's tunes , and the album is selling briskly ( 20,000 in the first three weeks ) from the garment district to the Catskills-and even beyond . <P> <P> The original Pins and Needles was , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Can Get It for You Wholesale Rome , then an unknown tune peddler , was a member of the staff of a resort hotel when the I.L.G.W.U. heard of his talent for grinding out entertainment for the guests . He agreed to write songs for the union 's review , and the next four years he turned out four different versions of Pins and Needles . The Columbia album is " a compendium of the best " from each edition . <P> To a modern listener , Composer Rome 's lyrics and music remain smart , catchy and almost unfailingly appealing-but sometimes curiously askew-as if they belonged not only to a different generation but to a different age . Such songs as One Big Union for Two and It 's Better with a Union Man ( " Always be upon your guard/ Demand to see a union card " ) are almost echoes of history-as is Rome 's jazzy Doing the Reactionary : <P> All the best dictators do it . <P> Millionaires keep steppin ' to it . <P> The Four Hundred love to sing it . <P> Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pins and Needles , however , is as timeless as good show music can be , and at its best Rome 's 25-year-old sleeper is a match for any show album on the market . Certainly no album of the current season more tunelessly defines the Wallflower 's Lament : <P> Nobody comes knocking at my front door . <P> What do they think my knocker 's for ? . . . <P> Oh , dear , what can the matter be ? Nobody makes a pass at me . . . <P> And the College Girl 's Complaint is as fresh as last June 's diploma : Once they gave me the honor seal . <P> Now I stand up with pains in my feet ... <P> I used to be on the daisy chain ; Now I 'm a chain-store daisy . . .
