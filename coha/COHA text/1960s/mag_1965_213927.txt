At 81 , with his right arm paralyzed , Charles Sheeler is nearly beyond accolades . Like blueprints of a new aesthetic , his precision paintings were the reductio ad minutam of the machine age . He mixed the academicism of his teacher , William Merritt Chase , with the cubist masters , made a living as a photographer until his immaculate industrial visions caught on . He could refine the reality of a locomotive 's monstrous driving wheels so that even when they are frozen in two dimensions , their tremendous momentum leaps out . <P> A stroke stopped Sheeler 's production in 1959 . Some of his last works , now on view in Manhattan 's Downtown Gallery , show that his precise touch never faltered . The 14 paintings are executed in tempera on small Plexiglas plates , something he often did before expanding them on large canvases . Some seem like multiple-photo exposures of oil refineries , lonely steelscapes gyrating in the sky . Others are pure scenery , where patchy foliage parts to let a background watercolor peep through the Plexiglas . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hard-edge and pop artists today acknowledge that they owe a clear debt to him . But he was " deeply moved by the response of the youngest generation , " aged seven to twelve years , who have rated him No. 1 among such company as Czanne , Franz Kline , Ben Shahn , Van Gogh and Robert Indiana . Some 300 children at U.C.L.A. 's University Elementary School preferred slides of Sheeler 's work to those of any other artist . Their art teacher suggested last year that they write to the artist and tell him so . Their letters are among Sheeler 's most treasured critical notices . <P> Wrote Carol Rogers , 9 : " I always recognize your paintings because they give me a quiet , lonely , deserted feeling . " Paul Rangell , 9 , wrote : " The reason I like your art is you put mathematics in it . " " I like your paintings because they 're clean and weird , " wrote Francis Sidney Howard Goldwyn , 10 . " Not weird scary but weird unusual . " One eight-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture too , " wrote Larry Sprowls . " You can make it so you ca n't tell what it 's doing . I ca n't . What kind of ruler do you use ? "
