My Sweet Charlie , by David Westheimer . Broadway 's racial conscience quickens whenever it pairs a white man and a Negro woman or a Negro man and a white woman to see which combination will lure more customers to the box office . Two seasons ago , the lucky combination was The Owl and the Pussycat , juxtaposing an erudite white bookstore clerk and a hoydenish Negro prostitute . My Sweet Charlie pairs a highly articulate Negro lawyer ( Louis Gossett ) from the North and a slatternly white mushhead of 17 ( Bonnie Bedelia ) . One after the other , they break into a Gulf Coast cottage in search of refuge . The girl , pregnant and unwed , has been thrown out by her father . The lawyer has killed a white man during a civil rights march . <P> Misery hates company , or so it seems for most of the play . Full of inbred Southern prejudices , the girl calls the man a " nigger " and wo n't sit at the kitchen table with him . Full of the critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl 's looks , grammar , vocabulary and dim wits . Gradually , their plight draws them together , and Playwright Westheimer achieves moments of mirth , poignance , compassion , and interracial rapport . <P> What enervates a play of this sort is that it lacks any dramatic excuse for existence as soon as one imagines it being played by two white or two Negro partners . It has no bloodstream of its own but siphons its vitality from the headlines of the hour , just as an inert patient is intravenously fed plasma . Furthermore , the fact that two very special kinds of outcasts discover a common bond of humanity is not particularly convincing proof that the bridge of universal brotherhood is easy to build . <P> The sparks of interaction that fly between proficient Actors Gossett and Bedelia camouflage the dearth of action in the play . Considering that the two hurl abuse at one another for minutes at a time , it is surprising that a playgoer ends the evening feeling that it has been spent with two decidedly likable people .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
