Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon marched into the Senate Finance Committee hearing room prepared to do battle-speedily , he hoped-for the Administration 's tax cut bill . But the only person there who seemed to be in much of a rush was Doug Dillon . <P> For seven months the bill had wallowed in the House Ways and Means Committee , finally emerged and was passed by the House , with significant changes from Kennedy 's original version . Now , at last , it was before Senator Harry Byrd 's Finance Committee . But Virginia 's Byrd is an all-out foe of cutting taxes without cutting federal spending , which the Administration definitely does not propose . So the measure is destined for more rough , slow sledding . <P> Dillon could not have been more eager to grease the legislative wheels . He promised that the Administration would not fight the House version , even though it is not wholly satisfactory . And as for tax " reform " - as opposed to reduction-Dillon said that this could wait until another day . <P> For his apparent willingness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an angry rebuke from liberal Illinois Democrat Paul H. Douglas : " By not having a virile stance in favor of tax reform , you have permitted the reform provisions to be gutted . " There was also a partisan slap from Tennessee 's Democratic Senator Albert Gore , a key member of the Finance Committee ( see box ) , who accused Republican Dillon of " subverting the economic liberal policies of the Democratic party at the Washington level . " Added Gore : " When the country votes conservative it votes Republican . I do n't know if you 'd like that or not . " <P> Throughout it all , Chairman Byrd benignly regarded Dillon from behind blue-tinted glasses , mildly noted that the House bill would result in an average annual saving of $110-$2 a week-for each taxpayer . Byrd merely wanted to know how such " cigarette money " would really stimulate the U.S. economy . Dillon replied defensively that while the cut might not mean much to individuals , the total effect would be impressive . Byrd nodded . Things were going his way-slowly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scheduled to be heard by his committee . Doubtless some of them would argue - as have Dillon and the Administration- that failure to pass the bill means a probable recession next year . But not everyone agreed with this . Last week the Business Council , whose 100-plus members are presidents and board chairmen of large U.S. corporations , heard a report by its committee of economists that business will be good through 1964 , tax cut or no.
