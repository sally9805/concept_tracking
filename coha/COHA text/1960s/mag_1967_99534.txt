Let joy be unrestrained , you image-conscious Americans . Let there be drinks all around and freestyle dancing in the streets . On one stunning afternoon this week the leanest , handsomest , least-ugly American of them all climbed into the car he calls the American Eagle and wrapped a famous European auto race in red , white and blue . As the Belgian Grand Prix growled to a finish in the slanting sunset over Spa , the only thing Dan Gurney had not done recently in Europe was leap tall buildings with a single bound . // Altogether it had been a remarkable three weeks in auto racing for America , Gurney and A. J. Foyt . First Foyt won the Indianapolis 500 ( for big 4.2-liter single-seaters and visiting turbines ) to reverse the trend to foreign champions . Then Foyt and Gurney seized the 24 Hours of Le Mans with a huge seven-liter Mark IV Ford , a so-called sports car prototype with fenders , lights , windshield wipers and all that . // But for the tall , blond Californian , last Sunday was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single-seater of his own creation that Gurney won in Belgium  --  at a record-breaking average speed of 145.988  --  and it was the first time in 46 years that an American car and driver had taken a Formula I race of such importance . No longer must Americans mumble , " Jimmy Murphy , French Grand Prix , Duesenberg , 1921 , " as an example of U.S. Grand Prix genius . // In the Belgian Grand Prix the object is to drive an 8.76-mile network of tree-lined country roads as fast as you dare for 245 miles , through 170-mph curves and along 200-mph straightaways ; all this in fragile little racers that look as if they will never make it . Winning gets a man nine points toward the world driving championship and a whole lot older all at once . // This was the fastest Grand Prix anywhere , ever , in history . At the finish behind Gurney came Scotland 's Jackie Stewart in a BRM . He had driven his last 10 laps with a balky gearbox , steering at top speed with one hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ran New Zealander Chris Amon in a Ferrari that , in spite of everything he could do , could not live up to its brilliant red paint job . // Only seven other cars finished , while eight more were broken and out of it and Ferrari Driver Mike Parkes lay in a nearby hospital with a broken leg . // The drivers obviously meant business right from the start of practice . The former world champion , Jimmy Clark , rifled around at 151.572 mph in a snarling new Lotus to win the pole , breaking John Surtees ' old qualifying record of 144.68  --  and giving himself a scare . On the back straightaway , winging uphill at a clocked 193 mph , he had hit a low-flying bird so hard that it dented his rear-vision mirror " about this far from my face . " Then Gurney did 149.347 mph , and Hill 148.154 in a sister car to Clark 's , and thus the American Eagle started the race sandwiched between a pair of Lotuses. // Both Lotuses were mean-looking , half-chassis affairs with new Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mini-monocoque chassis that ended behind the driver 's seat . Engines and rear suspension setups were bolted aft . In action the cars flashed past in green and yellow streaks , undulating like surfboards . This novel design had bounced Clark to victory a fortnight earlier in the Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort. // Then there was Jack Brabham 's new car , lighter and sleeker than anything around , glittering with chrome fittings and deep green paint and now boasting a new Repco V-8 from Australia , no hint remaining of last year 's Oldsmobile engine block . There were BRMs , Ferraris and Cooper-Maseratis , too , but it was the dark blue Eagle that caught the fancy of the Ardennes . Gurney 's car was a 1,020-pound GP version of his Indy Eagles , considerably lightened for tricky road work . The new Gurney-Weslake V-12 engine  --  so new , in fact , that there are only five in that clink like fine champagne glasses when struck . Crankcase and cylinder heads are aluminum , many of the innards are magnesium and the ribs and suspension parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of a car , " Gurney said , " but nobody wants a car to live forever . What we want it to do is win races . " // The three Ferrari entries sounded shrill and deadly , as Ferraris always do , but Franco Lini , who manages the Ferrari works team  --  perhaps because his middle name is Enzo  --  stood by the track and expressed a certain lack of confidence . // " At Spa , " said Lini , " the engine it must take a great speeding . It is a great sufferance to engines . " // " This whole thing , " said Stewart , " is an awful lot scarier than Indy . You should go down to some of those turns and see the cars wiggle . It is much faster than other circuits and you have to be a cowboy to ride it , but then I have always been a bit of a cowboy anyway . " // Still , Stewart was conscious enough of the course 's hazards  --  he had crashed and was seriously injured in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show up in a uniform with a special bit of tape pasted across his chest . On it he had written , " Blood group O-Rh+. " // The Spa circuit cuts through lush green countryside that obviously was subdivided by Hans Christian Andersen . It starts downhill , and at the beginning drivers stand on their brakes , revving their engines to high screams . Then the road rolls up around crowd-lined corners and down snaking turns into dark valleys in the shadow of Old World castles . // In the days before the race Gurney conducted a private , high-speed tour of the course , careening along in a Hertz Dodge Dart . " The real thrill , " he said , " comes in these downhill curves , where the G-forces put your whole stomach over against your rib cage . This is it ; this is the Olympics compared to an ordinary track meet . " // Back in his black racing helmet inside the Eagle , his face creased by enormous dimples , Gurney summed it up : " The secret of Spa , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No sudden braking , no sudden sharp turns that can get you into trouble . Actually , it is a controlled violence that does it . " // At the start on Sunday , Gurney slightly overdid the violence part ; he sat spinning his wheels , stirring up a small tornado of black smoke , before getting under way in sixth position . When the cars reappeared , Clark was in the lead as expected . Stewart was hot after him , with Chris Amon and Jochen Rindt behind and then Gurney in No. 5 spot . Graham Hill seemed to go directly from the starting line into the pits , where he disgustedly spent the rest of the day . In the early sparring Brabham , who had started in seventh spot , moved to fifth , Gurney to third . // Clark opened a long lead over both Stewart and Gurney , but then came a decisive moment of high drama . Clark whizzed into the pits and was immediately engulfed by a crew of men changing sparkplugs . Stewart , running second , flashed by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then Gurney wheeled in for what had to be the fastest pit stop in Formula I history . He leaned over to his crew , said something and pulled away while they were still poised where the car had been . Later Gurney revealed , " I simply said two words , ' Fuel pressure , ' and pulled away . I did it so quickly my crew chief did n't know whether I meant it was good or bad . " A few moments later Clark reentered the race in 11th place and began working up through the field , ultimately finishing sixth . // Gurney began to turn it on , fuel pressure be damned . On his 19th lap Dan set a new racing record of 148.217 mph , and on the next lap another : 148.848 . It was on lap 22 , with six laps to go , that he passed Stewart on the straight in front of the pits to take the lead for good . Afterward Gurney consoled his pit crew for the scary stop . " The fuel pressure was so low , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to death on the straightaways . I could n't believe it would straighten itself out , but as if by magic it cleared and the car began running smoothly . I could have run a little faster if I had n't been so worried about it . " // At the victory ceremony Gurney stood soldier-straight as the Belgians played a scratchy old recording of The Star-Spangled Banner , and then to the crowd 's surprised delight he plucked the blossoms from a big bouquet of roses and tossed them toward young ladies in the throng . Ah ! that Gurney . Ah ! that Eagle . Ah ! America .
