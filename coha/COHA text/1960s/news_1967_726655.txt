txt The nature of Communist China 's dramatic effort to regain lost influence in black Africa now is emerging in clearer detail . After a visit to Peking last June , Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda returned home with a momentous announcement : Peking had agreed to finance and build one of the most cherished dreams of east Africa , the 1,000-mile railway between Zambia and Tanzania . The news came as a jolt to capitals around the world . If true , it meant that Peking had made a bold play to repair the damage caused by a sharp series of diplomatic reverses in Africa in recent years . The " tanzam " railroad ? or " zamtan , " depending on whether a Zambian or a Tanzanian is talking ? would be much more than strips of steel . It is a symbol of development to black Africa and a significant potential weapon in the split between black states and white-dominated Rhodesia , South Africa , Angola , and Mozambique to the south . Surveyors dispatched The railroad would open up southwestern Tanzania and permit Zambia to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ es Salaam without having to cross Rhodesia or Angola and Mozambique . It would also let both . Zambia and Tanzania step up pressure  --  including guerrilla pressure ? on the white-ruled states . On the heels of President Kaunda 's announcement , Peking sent a survey team to Africa . On Sept. 5 it said an agreement had been reached . But that , it turned out , was not the whole story . Three days later , the world learned that the Chinese Communists had not been quite so generous after all . They had merely agreed to a $14 million interest-fre6 loan to pay for a construction survey . Neither Zambia nor Tanzania admitted this publicly . But now , here in Washington ; Zambia 's Minister for Foreign Affairs , Mr. R. C. Kamanga , has publicly admitted that China has not , in fact , agreed to actually build the whole railroad . Under questioning , he said future action depended on the results of the survey . It was the first time this had been officially conceded . Nationalism exploited Although he did not say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . At the end of it , China 's internal situation may have changed . The " cultural revolution " may have produced a new policy . China is not committed , at this stage , to more than the survey . Nevertheless , the Chinese have shrewdly exploited black African nationalism with the survey alone . They can be expected to wring every last drop of propaganda juice from it . " Why did n't Washington get in first ? " foreign diplomats here are asking . " After all , Peking has a lot to gain . Her surveyors will relish the chance to travel freely throughout the region . " Washington 's reasons were several . In the first place , the World Bank reported in 1964 that the railroad was simply uneconomic . The Great North Road from the copper belt to Dar es Salaam carries a lot of ore . * Please turn , to Page 5 *Africa wooed by Peking  --  but coyly // Since Rhodesia broke away from Britain , some 25 percent of Zambian copper exports have moved along it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road improvements . The Great North Road parallels the projected railroad bed ; for $25 million , it can be improved even more , and in less time than the railroad can even ' begin to be built . In any case , the railroad would cost between $300 million and $400 million  --  too great a burden on the Zambian and Tanzanian economies . By 1970 the Rhodesian problem could be solved , and copper shipments could go across Rhodesian soil as before . Image unproved As Mr. Kamanga made clear , the two black African nations reject this reasoning . East Africans tend to equate development with railroads , not just with ordinary roads . Even with a better Great North Road , copper shipments still would have to be sent across Angola , if not Rhodesia . " We told everyone we intended to have the railroad , " Mr. Kamanga said . " Our intentions were clear . Only China responded . " Washington officials profess not to be unduly worried about Peking 's skillful move . But the situation remains . How much advantage Peking can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its extreme caution in aid matters , remains to be seen . But it puts Peking in a better light to black Africans than in the days , not so long ago , when its meddling and inept calls for more revolution in Africa angered Ghana , Burundi , Dahomey , the Central African Repubr lic , and Kenya . Total Chinese assistance to Africa so far is a mere $50 million to $75 million . Meanwhile , Mr. Kamanga . continues to . insist that " force " is the only way to oust the Ian Smith regime in Salisbury . But neither London nor Washington has any intention of using force . The situation is in stalemate , with a negotiated settlement not unlikely .
