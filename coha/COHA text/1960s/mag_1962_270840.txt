UHURU ( 555 pp. ) - Robert Ruark-McGraw-Hill ( $5.95 ) . <P> <P> If the late great Ernest Hemingway was a man of achievement in search of a public character to match , Robert Ruark is a public character still in search of the achievement that can justify it . After his initial success as a Scripps-Howard columnist , Ruark moved to Spain , found himself a handsome villa on the Costa Brava , bought a high-power rifle suitable for shooting big game , and discovered Africa . With the discovery , he declared himself a novelist . It was a mistake . <P> His latest novel , like the earlier Something of Value , completely muddies the complex events taking place in Africa . Ruark obviously considers black Africans unfit to govern themselves . In Uhuru , Africans are portrayed as civilized on the surface but ready at the first opportunity to revert to savagery . Ruark 's sympathies are all with the white settlers . On page after page , the whites denounce " nigs , " " coons , " " wogs " and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> As in Something of Value , the hero is a superhuman , inhuman colonial who slaughters Mau Mau while they are sleeping , does not spare women or children$#151 ; this would be a sign of weakness . The novel ends on a note of hope , from Ruark 's point of view . One of the big African politicians gets a good dressing down from a colonial and finally recognizes that he should have stayed satisfied with his primitive life in the bush . " We are fast becoming a people of half-white , half-smart , half-civilized spivs and scoundrels and loafers and whores , " he confesses . <P> Uhuru reads like one long adolescent tirade against the black man in Africa . Not only that , but Ruark exalts the very thing he most fears from the liberated African : irrational violence . This book is a paean to it .
