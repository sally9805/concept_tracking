HIGH FINANCE One is a former junkman who began entrepreneuring at 16 by buying a deserted jail and selling its steel bars at a profit . Another is a courtly Southern tycoon who lives in a mansion in Yemassee , S.C . The third man once conducted his family business , the nation 's biggest maker of toothpaste tubes , from a floating desk in the pool of his Greenwich , Conn. , home until the pool became too small to contain his world . They make an unlikely trio , but together they have set out to be corporate conquerors in the style of Louis Wolfson and the late Robert Young . Last week the trio completed a major coup by taking control of ailing Lionel Corp . from Attorney Roy Cohn , bumping him down to chairman of the executive committee . That coup expands the assets of their growing empire to $140 million .
