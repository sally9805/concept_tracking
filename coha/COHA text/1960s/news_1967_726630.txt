txt The city 's Rent Administrator announced yesterday that families with only one parent and at least two dependent children would not be affected by plans to decontrol all apartments renting , as of April , 1965 , for more than $250 a month . The administrator , Frederic S. Berman , said he would also consider suggestions to protect from decontrol families that include aged persons and other dependents . He announced last month that controls would be lifted on the 6,000 to 7,000 apartments still under control that rent for more than $250 . Apartments renting for more than $250 as of April 1 , 1960 , were decontrolled in 1964 . At that time Mr. Berman said that apartments containing families with two parents and at least two children would not be decontrolled until the family moved voluntarily . Yesterday 's statement extended the same protection to families with one parent and two children , who often need more help than families with two parents , Mr. Berman said . The Administrator made his remarks at a City Hall hearing called to receive suggestions on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next fall . But the session quickly turned into an often angry discussion of the broad purpose of controls , which were imposed in 1943 as a wartime measure and still affect about 1.4-million apartments in the city . The Lindsay administration maintains that it is lifting controls on apartments costing more than $250 a month because the vacancy rate in this " class " of apartments is 8.81 per cent . The law says that controls must go if the vacancy rate in a particular class exceeds 5 per cent . Representative William Fitts Ryan accused the Mayor of breaking his campaign promise to maintain and strengthen rent controls . The administration , he said , could define a " class " of apartments in such a way as to forestall any decontrol . Court Action Possible For example , the Manhattan Democrat said , a class could be defined as all apartments costing more than $100 . The rate in this class would be less than 5 per cent , he said , and controls would remain . Mr. Berman , while conceding that he had the technical power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished , added : " However , we have to define classes in what the courts would deem to be a reasonable way . We are under constant threats of court action and if we try to make controls permanent when they were meant to be temporary the courts would really strike out with anger . " The Administrator also cited the threat of court action as the main reason for his opposition to a bill introduced in the City Council by Councilmen Theodore S. Weiss , Edward I. Koch and Lawrence Bernstein . The bill would abolish the concept of class and provide for decontrol only when the citywide vacancy rate exceeded 5 per cent . It also states that if the courts find the bill too tough on landlords the concept of class would be restored . About 150 people demonstrated in front of City Hall last night in support of the bill . In an interview , Mr. Berman objected to " inviting " the courts to offer opinions on rent control . " God knows what they 're liable to come up with , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could order the decontrol of thousands of apartments immediately if they chose to define " class " in certain ways . They said that City Hall is deeply concerned that judges would take the side of property owners if given a chance to play a positive role in the administration of controls . During the hearing Mr. Berman was served with papers by Franz S. Leichter , Democratic leader in the 69th Assembly District on the West Side . Mr. Leichter has filed a suit charging that Mr. Berman has no legal right to define a class of apartments and that such a definition must be made by the City Council . Several speakers also criticized Mr. Berman for ordering the decontrol of all apartments renting for more than $250 . They said that large apartments in that price range were still very scarce and should be protected . Mr. Berman said that the decision by the City Council in 1964 to decontrol a class defined solely by gross rental tied his hands . For example , he said , a fiveroom apartment containing four persons that rented for $275 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the city now said that all five-room apartments in that price range would never be decontrolled , the confusion would be considerable , Mr. Berman said .
