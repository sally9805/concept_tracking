txt Letters to the Editor of The Times Letters to the Editor of The Times O'Connor Opposes Merging D.A . Offices To the Editor : I read with interest your Feb. 9 editorial " One District Attorney for New York . " I believe my credentials to speak on this subject , as a former District Attorney of Queens County , are sufficiently well known to require no elaboration . I applaud the fact that you have dealt with the question of proposed consolidation of the five District Attorneys ' offices in New York City , since I believe this is a subject of far-reaching importance that deserves full and continuous discussion . In this spirit I take issue with the conclusion that your editorial espoused  --  namely , urging such consolidation . First of all , any such consolidation perforce would be a change in name . only . By virtue of the basic legal principles which govern law enforcement , county geography would still have to be'respected , and prosecutors ' offices and staff would still have to function within these separate subdivisions . Hence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an area chief in essence would serve merely to demote the importance of the office , and connotes ? an inferential attack , which I deplore , upon the integrity of the incumbents . Secondly , and what concerns me even more , is that the proposal to consolidate the five prosecutors ' offices is tied to a ' format making the prosecutors personal appointees of the executive arm of government , rather than independently elected officials . In my judgment , the public interest is best served by keeping intact the present separation of criminal prosecutions from the administrative business of the executive , whether it be the executive at City Hall or in the Governor 's Mansion . Safeguards Against Abuse Safeguards already exist to guard against abuse of office by , a prosecutor . No prosecutor worthy of his office should be subject to the dictates of any other governmental official . It is as important to preserve the independence and freedom of the prosecutors ' offices as it is to preserve the integrity and independence of the courts . Any proposal that threatens political interference with either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I join with you in complimenting the Manhattan District Attorney , Frank Hogan , for his splendid performance throughout his long tenure . But I respectfully point out that in some measure Mr. Hogan has achieved his enviable record precisely because the office of District Attorney was kept immune from outside direction and control . Your editorial also refers to a proposal for minimum statewide standards of eligibility , salaries and training for assistant district attorneys . This , to me , is another matter , involving separate considerations , and need not be tied into a package of wholesale devitalization of the office of the District . Attorney . I reiterate : the administration of justice is a subject that should always be uppermost in the minds of the citizenry , the press , and officialdom , and all proposals relating thereto , irrespective of their source , warrant the widest analysis and commentary . FRANK D. O'CONNOR President of the City Council New York , Feb. 10 , 1966 is quoted as saying , in your Feb. 6 issue , that the Vietcong represents about " one-half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " According to the Mansfield Report : " In December 1965 the best available estimates placed Vietcong strength in South Vietnam at 230,000 . " The total population of South Vietnam is generally placed at something over fourteen million . This indicates that 1.7 per cent of the population are Vietcong , which means that even on this basis Mr. Goldberg is off by a factor of more than three . But is it fair to say that the total constituency of the Vietcong is its fighting men ? If this same yardstick is applied to the United States , with armed forces of about three million out of a population of some 190 million , the figure conies out at 1.6 per cent . If one then introduces the mysterious factor of three , as Mr. Goldberg did , the conclusion is that the United States Government represents about one-half of 1 per cent of the American people . If this conclusion sounds silly , so did Mr. Goldberg 's . RICHARD HUDSON Editor War/Peace Report New York , Feb. 6 , 1966 ? Union Proposal for St. John 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heinous crime in the history of American higher education , The New York Times has seen fit to break its editorial silence ( Feb. 5 ) and come out for mediation . However , the one organization that had responded with a defensive act in the face of the summary dismissal of 31 St , John 's University professors without charges , hearings , or due process  --  the United Federation of College Teachers  --  gets an undeserved back-handed slap as recognition of its efforts . We are a union of professionals seeking to provide the employed educator with a voice in the conditions under which the profession is practiced . The U.F.C.T. is acknowledged by the victims of this academic decapitation to be their representative . It is one party to this dispute . The St. John 's administration is the other party . Mediators Proposed We are not mediators , nor have we sought this role in the controversy . We have asked that a group of Catholic laymen , or as The Times suggests , Catholic educators , serve as mediators between the union and the administration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's is uncomfortable in negotiating directly with the union . We have also proposed that a three-man hearing panel be convoked  --  one chosen by the administration ; one chosen by the union from the academic world ; the other individual would be chosen by the first two . The decisions of this hearing body would be binding on St. John 's and the union . Teachers wishing to return to St. John 's would be granted hearings at the teacher 's discretion . The teachers would agree to forswear any lawsuits as a result of any charges presented by the university . All publicity would be avoided . No reprisals of any kind would be visited against any participants in the protests . In , exchange , the union would withdraw any lawsuits in process . Campus Privileges Finally , the by-laws of the university would grant all faculty associations the customary campus privileges of meeting and of distributing material . The above proposals , the last in a long list of peacemaking efforts , were advanced in good faith by the U.F.C.T. to the administration of St. John 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open . Hopefully , good sense will prevail so that the daily increasing deterioration of St. John 's reputation in the academic community will be arrested . It should be clear to all which party desires to resolve this dispute and which party insists on perpetuating a grave injustice . ISRAEL KUGLER , President ( Rev. ) PETER O'REILLY Chairman , St. John 's Chapter United Federation of College Teachers New York , Feb. 5 , 1966 Dollar 's Erosion To the Editor : It might be worth while at this time to explain once more why price inflation in this country is inevitable . The rule is simple enough : " The purchasing power of the currency , in any country that is reasonably free , will be found to vary inversely according to the size of the public debt . " The experts , so-called , are arguing over whether we now have inflation , and whether we will have more , and if so when , and how it can be controlled . But most of this uproar is meaningless . The only real questions are , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt , including that of the states , cities , townships and assorted " authorities , " is probably somewhere around $321-billion . With our irresponsible Congress , plus this nightmare in Vietnam , the public debt will keep growing by leaps and bounds . The annual interest cost alone must be around $13-billion . Does anyone think that this money can come from any source except taxes ? Of course , there are some modifying factors , but it takes only an intelligent look at the history of every nation governea ay poinicians anu oureaucrats to prove that erosion of the purchasing power of the currency is universal and certain . In this country it averages close to 2 per cent a year . Can anything be done ? Not a thing . The intelligent citizen will make his plans to protect his own interests as best he can , closing his ears to the clamor of the panic-stricken statesmen , the befuddled economists and the realistic but practically helpless bankers . Good luck to him . ARTHUR H. JENKINS Jenkintown , Pa. , Feb. 7 , 1966 ? Transit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the response of ' The Times to the new study prepared by the Regional Plan Association , which continues to approach the city 's transit crisis with intelligence and validity . We desperately need unified command over transportation organs in New York , and an eventual trista te authority . Only such unification can lead to the setting of priorities on the ' limited funds available . It is manifestly absurd to encourage further private vehicle congestion in Manhattan , through expanded highways , bridges , tunnels , and parking garages , without channeling increased outlays toward the development of swifter , cleaner , and more efficient mass transit . These are decisions which must be faced now if we are not to suffer more paralysis and further deterioration . I am encouraged by Mayor John Lindsay 's anticipated reforms . In my estimation , nothing compares in importance to the course New ' York takes on this vital matter in the weeks and months ahead . SEYMOUR HALPHRN Member of Congress 6th District , New York Washington , Feb. 8 , 1963 ? Police Praised To the Editor : New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have had some opportunity to study the subject , and I know . Los Angeles gets high marks , but we still have the best . Sure , our police ca n't perform the miracles we expect of them . But consider the horrible social problems we have thrown in their faces . Look at the conditions under which they work . New York police are the best In the world , but they wo n't stay that way much longer unless every decent citizen takes pride in them and supports them vigorously , every day . Some time ago a resident of New York became a national celebrity because he went to the aid of a policeman in trouble . His case should n't be unusual . No citizen  --  even women and children  --  should hesitate for a moment to go to the aid of a policeman , no matter how frightening the situation . And let 's jettison that word " Cop .
