txt Republican and Democratic members of the State Reapportion commission failed at the midnight deadline to reach agreement on redistricting the Illinois House so the election for the legislative chamber in 1964 probably will be on an atlarge basis . After several hours discussion and argument , the 10 member-commission ? five Republicans and five Democrats ? failed to reach accord on the number of districts which should be alloted Chicago . Asked 21 for City Republicans held that the present 23 allotment should be reduced to 21 by virtue of a Chicago population loss between 1950 and 1960 . They also held that the growing Chicago suburbs in Cook county should be alloted two extra districts , from seven , because of a growth in population . This was the principal dispute which remained unresolved early today after the commission failed to file a state reapportionment plan with Secretary of State Charles F. Carpentier at midnight . Fred G. Gurley , Republican spokesman on the commission , was asked if he attached blame to the Democrats.for failure for the commission to agree . Gurley replied , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comment George Dunne , the Demo- ' cratic spokesman , asked whether the Republicans were to blame , said , " In view of the whole thin g , the Democrats moved more , than the Republicans . " It had been long rumored that the Democrats would present a 21-9 map to the Republicans at the last minute of the commission 's life . this proved to be true , but the details of the 21-9 map were not disclosed at the time of the failure of agreement . Gurley said that the last minute effort was to draw a map which would reduce the Republican districts of Chicago from three to two , but there was not sufficient time to evaluate certain figures presented by the Democrats . Tells of Discussions Dunne said that his partisans were in a position to discuss 23 districts for Chicago and seven for the suburbs , the present distribution , or 22 and 8 or 21 and 9 , and that they did eventually come to a discussion of 21 and 9 . Dunne said that acceptance of the 21-9 formula presented by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other areas of the state , he said , which included the proposed nine districts for Cook county and the accepted 29 districts for downstate Illinois . " We were flexible . " Dunne . " We were close to it . " Since midnight passed without accord , the probability of an at-large election of the 177 House members in 1964 becomes greater , altho the g o v er n o r could call a special legislative session which could modify the at-large provision . It has been feared that a completely open election , rather than nomination by district as in the past , would produce hundreds  --  perhaps a thousand ? candidates , result in a completely unwieldly ballot for which voting machines could not be used , and require a greatly complicated counting of votes . A special session probably could , depending upon the wording of the governor 's call , consider one or more of the following steps : Limit the number of House nominations , provide for nominations by conventions . fix a fee for filing House petitions , or agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Required Any legislation passed by a special session must have a two-thirds majority vote . The Senate is predominantly Republican ; the membership of the House is 80 Democrats and 90 Republicans . The reapportionment commission came into being in August by appointment of the governor , who was required to name it after he vetoed a Republican-sponsored remap bill passed by the legislature last June . The members have been largly at odds from the beginning , on a strictly partisan basis , and the climate last month was such that Republican members refused to attend two sessions held by Democrats alone because the Democrats refused to agree to the 21-9 Republican formula . The G. 0 . P. commissioners met in joint session with the Democrats last Thursday in hope that harmony would ? mark the final days of the body , but this proved impossible during the Thursday and Friday sessions . Open meetings were abandoned Friday and the commission after that held its sessions behind doors closed to reporters and the public .               @ @ @ @ @ @
