txt Alongside the Havana coal docks , almost in the shadow of gloomy Morro Castle , the 8,500-ton freighter Bratsk , a bright yellow hammer and sickle gleaming on her red smokestack , has been unloading fertilizer for many days . Over the week end a delegation of 14 mildmannered gentlemen from Peking concluded a pact that will send a half million tons of Cuban sugar to Communist China , perhaps preparing the way for the first Red Chinese embassy in Latin America . Across Havana Bay , the big Esso oil refinery , shut down two weeks ago , is in operation again , thanks to 25,000 tons of Russian crude oil just arrived from the Black Sea . These are just a few of the signposts of Cuba 's rapidly expanding trade with the Communist bloc nations . This reorientation of Cuban trade from North America to the Soviet bloc is one of the most fundamental changes being wrought by Fidel Castro 's revolutionary regime . Increasing Dependency It 's a change that naturally increases Communist influence here but one that may pose serious problems for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are only a few months old , Mr. Castro 's regime already has become far more dependent on Moscow 's economic good-will than other Soviet trade-and-aid targets , such as Egypt , became over a period of years . Many of the trade techniques blossoming here are old stories in other parts of the world ? the long-term , low interest credits , the dramatic purchases of surplus commodities , the littleheralded arrival of technicians and advisers and the much publicized testimonials to the " no strings " nature of Soviet economic dealings . But the speed with which political gains in Cuba have accompanied and followed these economic moves has been unusual . The Soviets ' speedy acceptance in Cuba very likely will encourage Moscow to try the same sort of economic penetration elsewhere in Central and South America . It 's clear the Soviets never intended to confine their efforts in this hemisphere to- Ceiba . Already they have given Argentina a $100 million credit , are trying to work out a three-year $100 million deal with Brazil and have made tempting offers , along with some small purchases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern of course , is that Communist political influence will follow the Soviet traders . A Red Showcase ? " That 's why Cuba may become a real showcase operation for Russia , " says a diplomat here . " That is , " he adds , " if the Russians can keep the Cubans from getting too excited . " Despite Premier Khrushchev 's blustering threats to protect Cuba against the United States with his long range rockets and the U S. State Department 's equally grim insistences that the Monroe Doctrine is far from dead , many observers are convinced the real battle for influence and allegiance in Latin America will be an economic one . It will be a difficult campaign for the U.S. to combat , even with President Eisenhower 's newly announced $500 million Latin American assistance plan . Soviet economic activity in the Latin lands now is small  --  imports of about $700 million and exports of some $600 million in the past five years . However , this trade hardly existed before 1954 . Also , the Soviets try to make relatively small sums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries of political importance . They also try to bring less developed nations to them by huge purchases of the one big export item , such as cotton in Egypt and now sugar in Cuba , on which such a nation depends . Supplies of Oil Most of all , the Soviets aim at becoming sole suppliers of a vital commodity . In Egypt it was arms ; here it is oil , and this makes Mr. Castro 's dependence on Moscow almost complete . The big international oil companies that control all but a trickle of the western world 's petroleum almost certainly would n't come back to Cuba while Mr. Castro remains in power . They already are black-listing tankers that haul Soviet crude oil to the seized Esso . Shell and Texaco refineries . They might well put even greater pressure on any Western company that decided to sell oil to Mr. Castro . " The Russians may not have foreseen how this would develop when they first signed up to sell oil to Castro , " observes a diplomat here , " but things coyd n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement , signed last February when Soviet First Deputy Premier Anastas Mikoyan was visiting here , set the pattern for Cuba 's new trade ties . The Russians gave Cuba a $100 million credit , repayable over 12 years at 2.5% interest , and promised to buy a million tons of sugar a year for five years and to furnish technical assistance on request for " construction of plants and factories . " The trade pact Is largely a barter agreement . When Russia buys Cuban sugar , it pays 20% in cash and the rest in goods . This also serves to tie Cuba 's commerce more tightly to Russia . Subsequent smaller trade agreements with Poland , Czechoslovakia and East Germany followed the same pattern . There 's considerable evidence all were masterminded In Moscow regardless of which Communist country put its name on the dotted lines . The Polish pact , for example , offers Cuba textile machinery , food processing plants and chemical equipment . But for three years the Poles have been trying to get American credits to buy just these things . If Cuba gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been there only long enough for transshipment from Russia . The pact with Communist China , announced over the weekend , calls for Cuba to ship 500,000 tons of sugar annually to the Chinese for the next five years . It apparently is similar to the Russian agreement , with payments 20% in cash and 80C1 .. in Chinese goods , including rice , farm machinery , textiles and soybeans According to the announcement , Cuba also will supply copper and nickel to Red China . This part of the arrangement has aroused considerable speculation in Havana . since Cuba 's only known sources of nickel are the Moa Bay Mining Co. , a subsidiary of the U.S. 's Freeport Sulphur Co. and the Nicaro mine , owned by the U.S. Government . Diplomatic Recognition It 's assumed a trade agreement will be followed by the establishment of diplomatic relations , something the Communist Chinese are anxious to see . They view Cuba as the first crack in the Latin American diplomatic barrier that has helped enable the U.S. to keep them out of the United Nations . The Cuban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity and happenstance . As more and more of Cuba 's economy was forced under state control , there was a natural attraction to other state-controlled economies This was reinforced by the Castro regime 's increasingly leftist political outlook . All the while , Cuba 's economy was deteriorating . Unpaid bills piled up so high traditional suppliers would n't grant any more credit ; Communist bloc sources of supply became a necessity . The turbulence and anti-Americanism of the Castro regime cut it off from the possibility of U.S. economic assistance that goes to other socialistic states such as India and Egypt . So , if Mr. Castro 's grandiose industrialization promises were to have any chance of being carried out , he needed Communist bloc help . and that meant trade to repay the credits . Finally , the apparent decision of foreign oil companies to stand up to Mr. Castro together brought on the wholesale refinery takeovers , a shutoff of Western oil supplies and a situation where Mr. Castro had to turn to Russia to keep his county from coming to a standstill . For half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trading partner . The figures were impressive even last year , despite the dislocations of Mr. Castro 's economic reforms ; the U.S. exported $437 million to Cuba and imported more than $470 million of Cuban products . The U S. still is the big supplier . Just a few days ago , for instance , the German freighter Adriana steamed in from New York , carrying the wares of such big and little American concerns as Union Carbide Corp. , Lone Star Cement Corp. , Westinghouse Electric Corp. , Simplex Valve &; Meter Co. , General Motors Corp . and Advance Transformer Co . But the trade totals are down drastically . In the first four months of 1960 , Cuban imports from the U.S. came to $96.7 - million , compared with $130 million for the like period a year ago and $195 million for the first four months of 1958 . " The Law of Nuts and Bolt ' , " Much of the reduction simply reflects Cuba 's economic stagnation and tight import controls but there also are studied attempts at diversion to the Soviet bloc Some importers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " suggestions " that Communist bloc countries should be favored whenever possible and that usually it 's easier to get an import quota for Soviet bloc goods than for American merchandise . Politics aside , there 's considerable doubt how far Cuba can go in its trade reorientation without running afoul of what one businessman here calls " the immutable law of nuts and bolts . " He explains : " The Soviets can supply the big things , the complete factories , the entire new pieces of equipment . But what about the thousands of little things , like valves , turbine fittings and packing for pumps that are needed to keep Cuba 's present , American-built plants operating ? Little things like the threading of a nut will cause trouble because the specifications are so different . Russian machinery is just as advanced as ours , but it 's different . One ca n't put Russian parts in an American engine . " Some sugar company officials say flatly their mills could not last more than one season without parts from the United States . More than 90 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattered across Cuba 's cane country comes from the U.S. Sugar cane juice , for all its sweetness , is a highly corrosive dilute acid . It eats iron and steel so rapidly that some mill equipment needs replacing every season or two . All the intricate gear that turns cane into sugar  --  beaters . vacuum pans , tubing and evaporators  --  has a short life expectancy . So do the mill pumps . conveyors . boilers and the like which by the nature of sugar production stand idle nine months of the year and work night and day the other three . - " The Russians could supply new mill units After all , they 've got the world 's biggest sugar industry . " notes one mill executive . " But if there weree't replacement parts from the States , it would mean two or three years of chaos while the changeover was made . " A U.S. embargo on exports to Cuba , a possible outcome of the Cuban-American economic war , would hurt this island much more surely than barring Cuban sugar from the premium price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead machinery all over the place right away ; there just are n't any warehouse stocks left to live on . " he adds . Foreign Exchange Prnblei . s Mr Castro misses few chances to flaunt his new Soviet bloc trade ties . Time after time on television , he 's praised the Soviets for their aid and assured his own people that they 've nothing to fear with the economic and military might of the " Socialist camp " behind them . Even the freighter Bratsk , unloading fertilizer , is part of the propaganda campaign The ship is moored at the coal docks , which have no warehouses and little storage space , so that much expensive handling work is necessary . But the coal dock is the most visible pier in all Havana . in clear view of the busy IvIalecon Boulevard , so that the anchorage is viewed by thousands of persons each day . Cuba may find itself forced to buy more and more from the Soviet bloc just to keep its trade ledgers straight . Russia , for example , has promised to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million at the present world price of around 3 cents a pound . Only 20 , ; - of this is to be paid in cash though , so Cuba must take more than $80 million of Soviet goods to stay even . Oil could almost balance the books ; if Russia supplies all Cuba 's oil needs the rest of this year , the bill will come to around $75 million . provided the claimed Soviet price of $2.10 a barrel is accurate . But this would leave Cuba the problem of finding foreign exchange to import badly needed food and manufactured goods  --  or bartering future sugar crops to the Soviets . The talk , at least , of Cuba 's officialdom now is all confidence . When Capt . Antonio Nunez Jinunez , executive director of the National Institute of Agrarian Reform , came back from six weeks in Eastern Europe a few days ago . he gave a glowing report of contracts signed and help promised . All in all , said Captain Nunez Jiminez , Cuba will " import " 56 factories from the Soviet bloc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the list will be a million-ton steel mill from Russia he described as " the most important economic event in the history and evolution of our country " From other Communist countries will come factories to make hinges , hacksaws , scissors , light bulbs , electric fans , lead pencils , chinaware , tools , wire screen and gasoline engines However , the Russians do n't give anything away , as Cuba may discover . All the Russian credits are repayable and the fact that they are bar ter deals sometimes mores costly Egypt , for ex-ample. found that Communist count/ les to which it was delivering cotton were , in turn- selling it on the world mai ket at pi ices the Egyptian expo , ter s could n't match The sugar RUS ' , 1.1 buys from Cuba for around 3 cents a pound costs nearly 4 cents a pound to produce , according to sugar industry authorities her e The Russian oil that 's coming here , on the other hand , is largely surplus ; the Soviets ' main cash outlay is for transportation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ %ill be the Banco Para de Comerci Exterior de Cuba or BANCEC . It is authorized to be Cuba 's sole exporter and importer " when reasons of national convenience advise " Last week it was given sole import rights over dozens of products , ranging from bacon and butter to record players , jute bags , barbed wire and locomotives . Aside from the million or so barrels of oil brought in already this month . Cuba 's new trade pattern has hardly had time to show up in the statistics . But the goods are coming in Farmers near Matanzas are spreading Soviet fertilizer on their fields . Czechoslovak trucks are at work on a number of public projects , and numerous Cubans are shaving their whiskers with East German razor blades . Perhaps most symbolic of all , the newspaper Revolucion , the regime 's increasingly Communist-line semiofficial voice , now is printed on Russian newsprint .
