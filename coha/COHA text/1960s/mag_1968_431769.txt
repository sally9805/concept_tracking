 | Not long ago , a young woman I know returned home from an exciting job in Paris . She had been there a year . She had learned a language , observed a people , confronted a culture . In her work , she served both the " beautiful " people and the poor people . On returning home , she happened to meet an old friend ? a mother of four . " A year in Paris ? " exclaimed the friend . " How did you do it ? Being on your own , I mean . In a strange country . " Suddenly reflective , the friend answered her own question . " Wait a minute . Ten years ago , I was twenty-seven and working overseas myself . I thought nothing of it then . But now , I 'm so accustomed to life with my husband and children always at my side , that I ca n't even go shopping alone . " This is a real example of how one woman ? shrouded and soothed by children , home and husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Chiefly because her area of service had narrowed . However fulfilling her life had become , the sense of giving " wholly " was ! eft behind at the altar . Instead of making the world her family , her family had become her only world .  | And a small world getting smaller . Today , in America , there are probably millions of these small-world women . It 's not that they have small hearts . They do n't . It 's just that they have stopped looking for new ways to serve ? new ways of serving the community or serving the nation . Right now , few things are more exciting than the way nuns are trying to reform their outdated customs . Religious women are swinging : all the way from the famous Sister Corita in Los Angeles to the most obscure nun in a Bronx grade school . They wear new clothes , live outside the convent , cause almost as much trouble for bishops as wives do for husbands . All this is happening because these sisters have sought out new ways of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispel taboos , why ca n't secular women ? I do n't mean just seeking better ways of modern living , but seeking also better ways of modern service . The sexes may have reached full equality at the polls and at work , but women still need to be given an appropriate role in national service . In all the talk about Selective Service , 52.1 percent of the population has gotten too little attention ? women . I am in favor of expanding the con cept of national service beyond military requirements to encompass humanitarian goals . am in favor of opening such service to women ; and , if necessary , I am also in favor of making this expanded kind of service a substitute for military duty for men . To achieve the kind of a nation that would result , I propose we start thinking now about the changes we should make as soon as the Vietnam war is over . At that time , I would like , first , to Sargent Shriver , United States Ambassador to France , was president of the Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became the first director of the Peace Corps , and served until 1965 when he became director of the Office of Economic Opportunity ? a post he held until his diplomatic assignment was announced last spring . His wife , Eunice , is a sister of the late President John F. Kennedy . see men given an option between military and nonmilitary service . And , second , I propose that women be given every opportunity possible for similar service to their country . In regard to the first proposal , I can hear the generals asking , " Where are we going to get the soldiers ? " Well , there are plenty of young men who like military life , physical combat and danger . Let 's pay them properly for honorable , hazardous duty ? say $10,000 a year , plus housing , food and pensions . Plenty will want to serve . Then we would have a volunteer army which , in the long run , seems to me much better than a conscripted one . As Walter Lippmann said last spring , " Britain performed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her forces . " He pointed out that Britain relied on volunteers and professional soldiers and that nobody dreamed of drafting the young men of the British Isles to protect her interests . The problems of Selective Service for men are presently being worked out . Within a short time , something fair , sensible and patriotic will likely result . But meanwhile not enough attention is being given women and their role in  | the various areas of national service . In the last eight years , I have repeatedly seen that women are just as courageous , patriotic and hard working as men . Their performance in the Peace Corps , VISTA and the Job Corps demonstrates that in terms of empathy and compassion , women frequently surpass men . And in terms of stamina and just plain guts , they are at least the equals of men . For example , seven years ago , when we opened a Peace Corps Training Center in the mountainous jungle area of Puerto Rico , the big question was : Would we dare let girls attend this camp , sleep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbing , survival swimming and jungle marches ? Would we dare let girls ? fresh from the safety of Vassar , or the familiar surroundings of Peachtree Street in Atlanta , or the serenity of an Iowa farm ? go out alone on a four-day journey on foot through the remote and dense rain forests of Puerto Rico ? Most advisers said " No . " There was fear of disease , fear of fatal accidents , fear of moral laxity , fear that Congress would object and fear of objections from frightened parents . None of these fears proved correct except the last . Parents did object for a while , but not after they had seen their daughters ' achievements and success . Their capacity for tough , sustained , demanding performance was first revealed in training , and splendidly proven thereafter in the field . I 'll never forget my visit to a hospital in a district about fifty miles from Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia . Three Peace Corps nurses were stationed at the hospital . They were attractive , happy , energetic . At lunch one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see my ward . " In a euphoric mood , I said I certainly would . Then a little later I asked , " Which ward is yours ? " She answered , " The leprosy ward . " Suddenly I was n't so keen to see it , even though I knew the disease was rarely contagious . But how could I say " no " if this attractive young girl worked there every day , all day , every week of every month of the entire year ? So I went in . She had the patients all sitting up in bed , dressed in blue denim pajamas . They had sores on their faces , their legs and arms . The nurse went down the row of beds , patting each patient , introducing them to me . Then , at one bed , the patient thrust out his arm to shake hands . His hand was a raw , red stump eaten away by disease . I flinched , and then I grasped it . It felt like a hot poker . I was scared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the nurse was n't . Through mayhem in Guatemala and riots in East Pakistan , our women have proved their coolness , courage and perseverance , but they have other ways of showing these qualities , some of them amusing . I recall five girls who used a vacation period from their Peace Corps assignment as teachers in Liberia to cross the Sahara Desert to Algeria . The first I knew of it came from a number of State Department cables asking if we knew anything about five , white , unescorted females crossing " the trackless wastes " of the Sahara . It was an area known by no one but hardy explorers and seasoned scouts . By the time I could check the matter , the girls had arrived safely , sold their story to a large national magazine and given the proceeds to a scholarship fund for impoverished high school students in Liberia ! American women have shown similar perseverance and ingenuity as advocates for the poor , the helpless and the deprived in this country , too . The Head Start Volunteers and Women in Community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women are willing to serve . There can be no doubt about their psychological and physical fitness , though it 's necessary to make any system for women flexible enough to accom-  | modate their special needs . Allowances must be made for part-time duty , intermittent duty , work near home and liberal sick leave . Since President John F. Kennedy made his famous appeal , " Ask not what your country can do for you , but what you can do for your country , " millions of American women have asked what specifically they can do for their country . But , too often , they have received no answer . So they say to themselves , " I 've asked what I can do for my country , but my country has n't responded . I 'm not needed . " and they turn away . They are wrong . They are desperately needed . In America today there are more than five million retarded children and adults , four million poverty-stricken migrant adults and children , about twenty million people made up of unskilled Indians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of automation , school dropouts. young addicts , slum parents and slum children . The need for manpoweror womanpower ? to solve their multitude of problems is just as critical as the need of the armed services . The kind of service I am thinking of would be authorized . and even financed in large part , by the government , but would not be Washington-controlled bureaucratic enterprise . I want the day to come when a young woman , or man , would be able to pick from forty-five or fifty kinds of duty , all on a list approved by the government . Surely if the United States Attorney General 's Office can get up a list of organizations loyal citizens can not belong to , then our government can get up another list of organizations they can belong to and which directly serve the national interest . Agencies wishing to take advantage of " servicewomen " could apply for a designation of eligibility in a manner similar to that used by organizations which apply to the Internal Revenue Service for tax exemption . If this were done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much different . We would have new attitudes and an entirely new atmosphere in which that service could be performed . President Johnson and the Commission on Civil Disorders have warned us that we are a nation that threatens to split apart . The President and the world were witness to the upheavals that for-@# lowed the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. , in April . Would not a broad system of service help bridge the gap between races and between rich and poor ? it could be the secret weapon needed to keep our country united . What I am saying is illustrated by a story I have told many times about a child and his mother sitting by a dusty road , up country in Ghana , Africa . Coming toward town walking along the road , the child saw a man . " Look , " said the child . " There goes a white man . " " That 's not a white man , " said the mother . " He 's a Peace Corps Volunteer . " What we have been working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in VISTA , in Upward Bound , in the Job Corps and in Foster Grandparents is to create a country where no one will say : " Look , there 's a white man ( or a brown man or a black man ) , " or " Look , there 's a rich man ( or a poor man ) , " but instead , " Look , there 's a human being who needs my help . " I have no doubt about the vigor of the American conscience and the extent of the American desire to help others . This enormous force for the public good , whether at home or abroad , can be directed toward solving one of our bitterest paradoxes ? the fact that the United States is the richest and most powerful nation in the world , and yet , within its borders , it harbors millions of citizens who desperately need help . Why could n't we have 4,100 Voluntary Service Boards right next to the 4,100 military draft boards we now have ? Any person ? man or woman ? could go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a national service would supply an equality they both desire and deserve . It 's not their fault that they still occupy a second rank . It 's the fault of a system that does n't provide challenge and opportunity to women . A huge proportion of them want to do something but there is no well-defined outlet for their talent , their dedication and their energy . National service for women would correct that deficiency . I believe that perhaps for the first time on a large scale there are opportunities for women to play a direct role in the fate of our world . That may be a mixed blessing . It takes away an excuse for doing nothing . The alibi used to be : " I do n't know where to begin . I do n't know what needs doing . I need special skills and graduate training . I ca n't do anything because that means a long-term commitment to career , a sacrifice of family responsibility and a rejection of wornanhood . " That line of defense would be gone for good . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am convinced they are ready , eager , willing and able to serve . Frankly , it 's still an open question whether service should be compulsory for women . There are sound arguments on both sides . Those who advocate compulsion say we are moving into a world where we treat men and women in fully equal terms , except where physiological differences require otherwise . Legislation applies equally to all . So does the vote , jury duty and the right to equal pay for equal work . In the spirit of the new equality , many women want to serve ? they feel if the men must , women should , too . Service should be regarded as training and education for everyone . On the other hand , public opinion ? at this time ? is probably against compulsory service for women . Some argue we do n't need anything like the numbers that would be available for service if it were compulsory ; and the logistics of handling hundreds of thousands are considered impossible in terms of staff and places to train . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system and upon industry . There 's also the question of coping with young marriages . Whatever way the question is finally settled ? whether service for women is compulsory or voluntary ? the object is the same : securing the talents of women who are desperately needed ? in personal ways , like working personally at the local . level to solve local problems . I have learned that there is no single individual in America smart enough to know exactly what to do in both Montgomery County , Maryland , and Montgomery , Alabama . The American people at home , in their own localities , can arrange these things better than their government can . For example , in December of 1964 , I was trying to decide whether to begin the Head Start program . The experts told me I could not hope to reach more than 2,500 youngsters in 109 locations by the summer of 1965 . They said there were not enough qualified people to teach the children and not enough places to house them . They were wrong . We set up broad guidelines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered everyone an equal chance to participate ? settlement houses , hospitals . churches , YWCAs , as well as schools . The result was that we had 561,000 children in 10,000 locations that summer . And women helped greatly to do it . They were able to do it because no one was trying to do all the thinking , planning and acting in Washington . Should women be drafted ? I believe not . For I am certain that if women are made aware of the tremendous need for their talents in solving the human problems that challenge us at home and abroad , no draft will be necessary .
