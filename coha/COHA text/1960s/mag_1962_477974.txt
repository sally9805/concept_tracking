Massachusetts , has chided me for being remiss in the first duty of every editorial writer : To tell the President and Congress how to run the country . She brushed aside my excuses ? that ( a ) they were hired to do this job and ( b ) maybe they know more about it than most columnists . Nonsense , she said ; such evasion is sheer cowardice , and besides any columnist who doubts his own omniscience ought to turn in his uniform . Does David Lawrence flinch from instructing Congress in economics ? NA7here would the Supreme Court be without Arthur Krock to interpret the Constitution ? How could any Secretary of State conduct our foreign policy without the guidance of Joe Alsop ? At the moment , unfortunately , I ca n't lav my hands on a set of hydramatic , non-slip solutions to the country 's fiscal and foreign problems . But since the Wood 's Hole lady insists , I am in a position to offer Mr. Kennedy some advice on one matter that seems to be giving him plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lost , more jobs than he has , even though mine were n't so classy . I T is perfectly clear , to me at least , why Mr. Kennedy has n't been able to fund jobs for our three or folly million unemployed . The human race ? or anyhow that sample of it located in North America ? no longer fits the kind of society it has to live in . Our society just does n't have any jobs for certain types of people . If it continues to develop along its present course , the number of such unemployables seems likely to grow rather rapidly . Meanwhile , at the other end of the scale , an increasing number of important jobs will remain empty , because there are n't enough men and women able to fill them . So the chief characteristic of The Overdeveloped Society ( if that is the right label ) will be a permanent surplus of some kinds of workers , together with a permanent shortage of others . For the assortment of jobs which need to he done is simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few figures show how this happened . According to the psychologists , intelligence seems to he parceled out among human beings in line with a fairly consistent pattern . If you should roundup a hundred typical Americans off the street , getting a fair sample of our whole population , you would find that about 46 of them would have something close to " normal " intelligence ? that is , Intelligence Quotients between 90 and 109 . Another 29 would be quite bright , with IQs ranging from 110 to 139 . And one or two would be really brilliant , with IQs of 110 or above. * On the other hand , 20 people in this group would have to be classed as fairly stupid , since their ! Qs would fall between 70 and 89 . And two or three , with ratings below 70 , would barely have enough sense to come in out of the rain . From the beginning of history until fairly * These figures are quoted from Lee J. Cronbach 's Essentials of Psychological Testing , p. 172 , second edition ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard Stanford-Binet tests . Similar tables can be found in most basic psychology texts . Such figures probably should be taken with a moderate amount of sal ' . For example , sonic educators have suggested that the usual Stanford-Binet tests may exaggerate the native brainpower of people who come from comfortable middle-class backgrounds , while underestimating the intelligence of those from poor families and laboring-class traditions . Frequently tests are so poorly administered that they give inaccurate results . Moreover , recent experiments in the New York schools seem to indicate that an individual 's IQ is not permanently fixed ? that it can be raised quite a few points by special educational efforts and motivational stimuli . Conversely , anybody confined for too long in a dull , unchallenging environment may grow stupider . ( From my own boyhood work on farms , I know that prolonged association with cattle and horses ? two of the stupidest creatures God ever made ? can have a numbing effect on the mind . ) Finally . the Stanford-Binet tests seem incapable of measuring sonic types of mind . They work best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and abstract concepts : but they tell little about one 's capacity for handling colors , sounds . shapes , and human relationships . Consequently , a person of real talent and high social value ? a painter , musician , sculptor , mechanic , or a woman with the warm empathy needed to run an orphanage or kindergarten ? might score low on the conventional IQ scale . If such limitations are kept in mind . however , the general conclusions pointed by the IQ figures seem sound enough : some people are born a lot brighter than others , and will stay that way . No amount of special training and stimulus will convert a 70 IQ mind into an intellectual giant . recently ? say , a couple of generations ago ? every society in the world had plenty of jobs for low IQ people . They could herd sheep , pick cotton , dig ditches ( even the Erie Canal was made with spades ) , h'ist that bale and tote that load . Indeed , nearly all of the earth 's work called for strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hewers of wood . Jobs that demanded real intelligence , on the other hand , were strictly limited ; most communities had room for only a few doctors , ministers , teachers , lawyers , and captains of industry . Scientists were practically unknown . ( As Robert Oppenheimer once pointed out in these pages , quoting Professor Purcell of Harvard , 90 per cent of all the scientists that ever lived are living today . ) Government administrators were almost as scarce ; Alexander Hamilton could run the Treasury Department with five clerks . As a consequence , thousands of high IQ people lived in frustration , because they could find no work equal to their talents . In many parts of the world this is still true . Some of the brightest people I ever met ? in Greece and Yugoslavia ? are hauling nets , throwing the shuttle on hand looms , sweeping streets , and winnowing grain with a hand basket . But in the industrialized countries , as we all know , human muscle has now become almost obsolete . Anything it can lift . a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the same motions can be done faster and cheaper by a mechanical or electronic device . So the muscle-worker is out of luck . He can still find a few things to do ? collecting garbage , for example , unloading trucks , replacing railway ties ? but these are mostly in minor or backward industries which have not yet got around to complete mechanization . And the number of such low-IQ chores is dwindling every day . Farming perhaps offers the most vivid illustration of what is happening . As recently as my grandfather 's day , farming was a set of inherited motions , not very different from those used by the Babylonians . As a boy in Ohio , he sowed wheat by hand-broadcasting and harvested it with a scythe . Since neither of these operations strains the cerebral cortex , a youngster who was too dumb for anything else could always make a living on the farm ; the demand for field hands was virtually unlimited . Today , however , a successful farmer has to be a combination geneticist , mechanical engineer , chemist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in all likelihood he is a college graduate . While he may still hire some unskilled migrant labor for a few weeks a year to harvest certain fruit and vegetahle crops , he can very frequently operate a big farm without any help outside the family . If he does take on a full-time hand . he looks for a smart one ; no farmer wants to entrust $10,000 worth of complex agricultural machinery to a dope . It should be noted that this permanent de-jobbing of the slow-witted is something different from the problem of technological unemployment discussed elsewhere in this issue by Paul Jacobs . The printers and flight engineers Mr. Jacobs writes about are mostly well above " normal " in intelligence ; since they were smart enough to acquire fairly complicated skills ? now made obsolescent by technological changes ? they presumably are smart enough to do something else useful . But chat 22 per cent of the population with IQs below 89 may in many cases never learn to do any useful job . The youngsters who drop out of high school before graduation are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of economic problems , but because they ca n't keep up with the not-. very-demanding work . The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that 80 per cent of the drop-outs are lagging by at least one grade ; and Dr. Cronbach notes that " the very dull tend to drop out as soon as they reach age sixteen . By the end of high school , almost no one with IQ below 85 is still in school . " This is one reason why the unemployment rate for sixteen- to nineteen-year-olds is twice as high as for adults . A few get jobs as messengers. gas pump operators , or dishwashers . Many others drift straight from the classroom to the relief rolls , or to crime . For as our society is now organized , we ca n't find any use for most of these young dullards ? a situation unjust and miserable to them , and to the rest of the community both costly and dangerous . T II E counterpart of this situation is a severe and increasing shortage of people brainy enough to man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design , supervision , and maintenance of automated equipment require a lot of smart , highly trained people ? and even now industry ca n't find enough of them . Did you ever hear of a good computer-programmer who was out of work ? So too with the rest of our society . All the professions which demand better-than-average minds ? medicine , law , journalism , teaching , the sciences , advertising , the military ? are moaning about their difficulties in attracting enough competent recruits . And as the structure of society grows in both complexity and size , the need for able managers ( in business and government alike ) grows in almost geometric ratio . Our inability to locate enough first-rate managerial talent in many fields ? from college president to corporate comptroller , from regional planner to operations analyst ? may yet prove to be the breakdown point in our civilization . For we have apparently built ourselves , unintentionally and without quite realizing it , a society which calls for a distribution of intelligence entirely different from that which THE EDITOR 'S God provided . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . In order to do so , we probably will have to change some of our most cherished mental habits ? not just those of the President and our Congressmen , but of all of us , For one thing , well have to face up to the fact that all men are noi created equal , except in the limited political sense which Jefferson had in mind when he drafted the Declaration of Independence . Until we do that , it will be impossible for our public officials to find useful work for the 20-plus per cent of the population with below-normal intelligence , or to train them for jobs they are capable of handling . And it will remain almost equally hard to make the best use of our limited supply of high IQs . Right now it is not only unfashionable , but almost indecent , to hint that such a problem even exists . Our educationists presumably know all about IQ distributions , and they are surely aware of the National Education Association 's findings that about 25 per cent of Selective Service registrants fail the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about " slow learners , " " culturally deprived children , " " under-achievers " ? almost any euphemism to avoid admitting that a lot of children are unable to absorb the kind of education we are trying to push down their throats at such expense . This is not entirely their fault . It is true that the canonised educational doctrine still puts undue emphasis on protecting the little ego from the harsh facts of competitive life ; but this is at least in part a reflection of community pressures . just suppose that a school principal called a doting suburban mother into his office anti told her : " I am sorry to have to report that little Johnny does not have an inferiority complex , as you have always assumed . He is just inferior . He will never get into Yale . He does n't even have enough brains to pass his final high-school examinations . With proper training , however , he might become an adequate ? This figure is for registrants in New York State in the year 1959 ; but there is no reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or waiter . I suggest therefore that you remove him at once from high school , thus saving a great deal of the taxpayers ' money and your own , and enroll him in the Hotel Employees Institute . " The resulting uproar , as we all know , would shake the walls of the Board of Education . And it is not only Johnny 's parents who would be affronted . Many of us would feel that it was somehow undemocratic , or at least inhumane , to blurt out such unpleasant truths . W E are even a bit uneasy about giving special attention to especially talented pupils . In recent years there has been a good deal of talk about the gifted child , and the better school systems are experimenting with enriched curricula . Yet in the great majority of high schools , the really bright youngster is still bored , underworked , and educated far be-/ow his capacity . The social and economic biases in American society are at least partly responsible for this failure to make the best use of our best brains ? wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , try hard to protect their duller offspring from the consequences of their stupidity . As a result , prosperous communities are likely to spend an inordinate amount of their school money trying to cosset and prop up the mental laggards ? to the neglect of the uncommonly able . At the same time , our poorer neighborhoods are likely to have poor schools , where the bright youngster may never be spotted and almost certainly will not get the intensive , top-caliber instruction he deserves . Americans are not yet ready , apparently , to search out the high-potential students ? at whatever age their talent begins to show and anywhere they can be found , in slum or suburb ? and to say : " This five per cent have the possibility of becoming our future William Faulkners , Robert McNamaras , George Gershwins , and Alfred Sloans . They represent an invaluable asset . Therefore it is vital to the public interest to give them the very best teachers and equipment , and to push them to the limits of their capacity . The second-raters will have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By our traditional THE EASY CHAIR habits , it may be . But in the not-sodistant future it may prove to be the only way possible to run the peculiar kind of society we are developing . WE might also profit if we could change our national attitude toward certain kinds of employment . From the earliest days of the Republic , most Americans have regarded personal service as somehow degrading . Hardly anybody wanted to be a housekeeper or rook , and those hapless widows who were forced into such work to avoid starvation usually did it bitterly and with little pride . Butlers and valets were legendary creatures who belonged in British country homes or Wodehouse novels , but had no place in democratic America . Waiting tables was , and is , so unpopular ! hat many restaurants have to import their help from Europe or Puerto Rico . These prejudices evidently are peculiar to America , not to democracies in general . in Switzerland , the oldest democracy in Europe , the profession of waiter is both honorable and much sought-after , while it is still possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ireland , and Greece . ( In England , however , the Americanization of society has made the butler and the maid almost extinct ; those few who still exist there are mostly imported from Sweden , Italy , and Eire . ) " Whatever their origins , such attitudes are costly . Both the efficiency and the tone of American life would be vastly improved if personal service came to be regarded as an ac-1 ceptable way to make a living . For we now have the curious spectacle of millions of people on relief , while at the same time millions of households are looking for desperately needed help ? to care for elderly relatives , tend the children , and help with the heavier chores . If such help could be found , countless women ? many of them highly educated ? could be freed for teaching and other understaffed professions . . innumerable old people would not have to be condemned to nursing homes ... any number of businessmen could save the energy now dissipated in shoveling snow , putting up storm windows , and tinkering with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anecdotes of hospitality ? wholeheartedly given and gracefully accepted . When a stranger stood at the threshold , he became an honored guest of the house . The tradition of centuries is even stronger today . The people of India wish to welcome visitors from other lands , and to share with them , even if briefly , the Indian way of life . To make it easier for you to meet them a special program has been developed . The idea is simple and gracious ? and , of course , costs nothing . Let 's say you are a businessman , a teacher , a lawyer , a doctor , or just a person who wishes to meet Indians with interests similar to your own . Before you leave for India , call upon the Government of India Tourist Office at 19 East 49th Street in New York City ; 685 Market Street in San Francisco ; 177 King Street . W. in Toronto . Or after you arrive in India , upon the Government of India Tourist Offices in Bombay , Delhi , Calcutta or Madras . Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in India . They will be happy to help you choose your Indian friends from a list of persons who will be looking forward to welcoming you in their homes , and to making your visit as full and as rewarding as they can . Once in India , meet with your new friends , accept their invitation to tea or a meal with them in their home . There you will meet other members of their family , exchange ideas and glimpse their particular brand of humor . You may enjoy seeing the local sights with your new friends , or playing a round of golf at an elegant country club . Perhaps a day at a sunny beach or a cricket match , the cinema or a dance recital . Simple delights which heighten in pleasure when you enjoy them in the company of your Indian friends . The people of India are very much like you , proud of their country and their traditions . They have a lively interest in knowing more about your country , how you feel about today 's world and everything in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next ? your Indian friends will wait for you . plumbing . It might even become possible to get prompt and courteous service in the average hotel and restaurant ? but no , that is carrying fantasy too far . Such work demands no great intelligence and only a minimum of training . Yet it is scorned by nearly all the people on the unemployment rolls . That is n't our kind of work , they say ? and relief officials ordinarily will not require their clients to accept any job opening outside their customary trade . I have no idea how such ingrained attitudes might be changed . Perhaps it could be done by professionalizing service work , and thus removing the stigma of the servant , Already this is being attempted , with some success , by a few companies which send out crews of trained men and women to do spring housecleaning , household repair , and the like . Their workers wear snappy uniforms , they work for the company instead of the householder , and they put in a regular eight-hour clay ; as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N0 doubt there are many other and better ways to find useful work for the low IQs , and to persuade them to do it . My main point is that nobody seems to he thinking about such things , because nobody is yet willing to admit publicly that the Stupidity Problem needs coping with . The steps taken by the Kennedy Administration to fight unemployment ? new factories for distressed areas , retraining for technologically displaced workers , general stimulus of the economy ? may be fine for their own purposes ; but they ignore the special problem of the dullard . This is not only expensive , but dangerous . When you condemn people indefinitely to idleness and public charity , yon condemn them also to frustration and bitterness ? to the kind of discontent which may have a lot to do with the crime rate , drug addiction , and political unrest . It ought not to he beyond human ingenuity to create worthwhile jobs for these people , if we only set our minds to it . If we tended our forests , for example , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man-hours of not-very-ski/led work ? and we would increase enormonsly the value of a precious national asset . We could use a lot of muscle power in deferred maintenance of our dilapidated railways . We might even set a few hundred thousand men to work cleaning the litter off our streets and the beer cans out of our trash-clogged parks and streams . And we might start now to devise an educational system which will candidly train every youngster for a level of work that fits his intelligence , instead of pretending that each of them is potential college material . I am pretty sure that the lady in Wood 's Hole , who is something of a sentimentalist , wo n't like any of these suggestions ; but then she asked for it .
