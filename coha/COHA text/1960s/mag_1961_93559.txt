Hopelessly out of control , the flame-red racing car triphammered a knot of spectators , flipped back onto the racecourse and was still . The race flowed on , but that convulsive moment in last Sunday 's Italian Grand Prix was decisive , irrevocable . In it were realized the loftiest hopes and deepest fears of the American who is the world 's new road racing champion . Phil Hill of Santa Monica , Calif. won the race and thus the championship . But Count Wolfgang von Trips , his teammate and rival for racing 's greatest prize , lay dead , as did 14 spectators , and the sport of motor racing , already scarred by the dead of Le Mans in 1955 , the Mille Miglia in 1957 and many others , had suffered another visceral blow . // Hill wept even as he received his laurels , for he had not known until then that Von Trips was dead . Into his tears went all the anguish of a moody , self-critical , sensitive man  --  a Hamlet in goggles and gloves  --  who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it alone . With Von Trips dead , it would now be said that Hill was champion by default . The tense Californian had it to do all over again . // For both Von Trips and Hill , the road to Monza had been a gantlet of tortures . The German , frail from birth , nagged by aristocratic parents to come home to his Rhineland castle and tend his estates , had stubbornly raced first motorcycles and then cars . He cracked up often  --  for which he was dubbed Count Crash . // But the hawk-nosed , blue-eyed count persevered . Maturity polished the ragged edges of his driving technique . By last year he was a full-fledged driver for Enzo Ferrari , the temperamental patriarch of Italian racing and builder of its only current Grand Prix cars . // Hill 's tortures were self-inflicted . From the day he seriously went racing , in 1950 , he was beset by doubt , yet driven by inner goads to excel . Rising through the ragged ranks of amateurs and polished overseas pros to star caliber , perfecting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for a Grand Prix ride , Hill finally captured the racing world 's esteem but not , somehow , his own . // His nervous introspection made him unpredictable off the course . One never knew whether he might speak with warmth and eloquence on racing or spit out a flat , abrupt phrase cutting an interviewer short . When in 1958 Enzo Ferrari promoted him from sports cars to Grand Prix racers his tenseness only increased . Sports car events , for the most part endurance races , are won by smoothness and simple stamina ; the brutal man-to-man combat of the shorter Grand Prix makes harsher , more explosive demands . Lacking the killer instinct of a Tazio Nuvolari or the supreme technical mastery of a Juan Fangio  --  to name two Grand Prix immortals who preceded him  --  Hill as a Grand Prix man was often less than sure he was in the right business . // But 1961 found Hill the No. 1 Ferrari driver , with Von Trips a stride behind . ( At least , so expert observers agreed ; Ferrari himself did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Ferrari 's year . The choleric Italian had developed a racing engine vastly superior to those of his rival British and German builders . The only question remaining was which of his aces was to seize the championship . // Except for two race-winning raids by the British virtuoso Stirling Moss ( SI , Aug. 28 ) in underpowered English Lotuses , Ferrari 's pre-eminence was complete . Through the summer Von Trips and Hill dueled bitterly , ferociously , on the tracks of Monaco , Holland , Belgium , France , Great Britain and Germany . When the Grand Prix circus arrived at Monza last week , Von Trips led in the driver championship race by four precious points , 33 to 29 . By winning now , Von Trips could clinch the title , even though the U.S. Grand Prix at Watkins Glen , N.Y . remained to close the season on October 8. // At Monza , Hill 's taut nerves stretched to breaking ; he qualified only fourth-fastest . " Everything 's gone wrong with my car , " he barked . " We may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk . I could n't even be civil . " // In fact , Hill had Ferrari mechanics work through the night , installing a new engine . // Safely placed on the pole , Von Trips was cool and relaxed . " We may be teammates , " he said , " but one has to fight . I love fighting . " // The fighting commenced on a hot , hazy day on Monza 's peculiar road-plus-oval track course , etched in a tree-shaded park . Police struggled to control a huge crowd of festive Italians who , confident of a Ferrari victory , jostled to be near the fences as 32 low-slung , open-wheeled cars screeched into motion . Disaster struck early . Only one 6.2-mile lap of the 267-mile race had been run when Von Trips seemed to slow a bit while entering a curve . Lotus Driver Jimmy Clark bumped him from behind . Von Trips 's Ferrari , speeding at upward of 130 mph , danced up against a guardrail , plunged across the track , into the helpless spectators and back to the track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did Phil Hill become the first American ever to win the world championship . // " It all seems so unreal , " said Hill . " It all seems so unreal . "
