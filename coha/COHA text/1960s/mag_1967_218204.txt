At Maryland 's Chevy Chase Club last week , groundkeepers with shovels and brooms were clearing off a 6-in. snowfall from the club 's seven raised-platform courts in time for the annual mixed-doubles " scramble . " At Darien , Conn. ' s Wee Burn Country Club , 3 in. of drifting snow was being pushed off the courts in preparation for the national championships . And at Brookline , Mass. , The Country Club was rushing to completion the first two platform-tennis courts in the club 's long history . All this activity must be over and done with before winter ends . For platform tennis , more commonly called paddle tennis , is not only the newest addition to the family of tennis-type court games : it is unique in that it is played primarily in winter and always outdoors . <P> Scored like tennis , the game takes place on a wooden platform 60 ft. long and 30 ft. wide surrounded by chicken-wire walls , off which the ball can be played , as in squash . Players wield short-handled wooden paddles , get only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , colored orange so that it shows up against snowy backgrounds , is extremely lively , with the result that sharply angled shots become as important as sheer power . Favorite ploys include the deep lob that forces the opponent away from the net and a low , sinking squash shot that slides off the wires at an oblique angle . <P> Easy Charm . The game was invented in the 1920s by Frank Beal , then secretary of the Community Council of New York , as a tennis substitute for the city 's playgrounds . It never caught on in the city , but since 1928 , when the first paddle-tennis court was built in Scarsdale , N.Y. , the game has been spreading in upper-class suburbs , is now played as far south as Washington and as far west as Minneapolis . <P> The New York-New Jersey-Connecticut area remains the center of paddle-tennis activity . Such country clubs as Greenwich 's Stanwich , Rye 's Manursing Island and New Canaan 's Country Club like paddle tennis because , though the courts cost $5,000 apiece , they are cheap to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts too : Philip Morris President Joseph Cullman III , for example , has two courts on his Briarcliff Manor estate , normally entertains a dozen paddle-playing guests each weekend throughout the winter . All told , the American Platform Tennis Association estimates , there are some 500 courts in the U.S. , and enthusiasts will go to great lengths to get to one . Last year Caroline Nelson , current A.P.T.A. women's-doubles champion , moved from Scarsdale , where she played regularly at the Fox Meadow Tennis Club , to Bryn Mawr , Pa. , where there is a dearth of courts and top-ranked players ; nothing daunted , she now drives back to Scarsdale , a six-hour trip , once a week . <P> Part of the charm of the game , which is almost always played as doubles , is that it is easy to learn . The difference in hitting power between men and women , which so often ruins a mixed-doubles match in tennis , counts for less because the ball can still be played off the wire walls . Says A.P.T.A. Secretary-Treasurer Edmund Swanberg : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
