In their offices just across from the White House , the President 's hardworking economic advisers are expected to stay on the job until they see the lights blink off in Lyndon Johnson 's Oval Room . Last week their lights burned even later than usual as the members of the Council of Economic Advisers grappled with a problem that deeply affects U.S. business : how to keep the economy expanding well into 1965 . The council members-and many businessmen-are concerned about speculation that the economy is showing signs of age after its 45-month expansion , and that there is little on the horizon to keep it rising rapidly beyond next year 's first half . Business psychology , after all , is an important ingredient in the advance , and no one wants to see it turn bad . <P> Quite a few experts are warning businessmen against talking themselves into a slowdown . " The majority of forecasters are too pessimistic , " said James O'Leary , vice president of the Life Insurance Association of America , in a speech in Manhattan . The speculation about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervousness , notably in the stock market . Since reaching an alltime high of 891 four weeks ago , the Dow-Jones industrial average has retreated 27 points . Depressed by all the talk , as well as by Britain 's financial crisis , it fell 6 points last week . The usual year-end rally could still occur-the market has risen in 50 of the last 67 Decembers-but last week 's decline pretty well dashed the hopes of the bulls who had expected it to crack 900 by New Year 's Eve . <P> Some Doing . Many businessmen are hoping that Lyndon Johnson 's year-end policy statements about the economy will put some fizz back into business psychology . " My guess and my hope is that he will turn up confidence-building statements , " said Raymond Saulnier , former chief economic adviser under President Eisenhower . <P> There is , in fact , plenty of basis for confidence . In industries as diverse as rubber , furniture and electronics , top officials last week reported record sales for 1964-and said that they expect to do at least as well in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record of 117 million tons and are well on their way to a 125 million-ton year ; the automakers last week set an alltime weekly production peak of 223,500 cars . Personal income is rising by an average of almost $2 billion a month , and retail sales , running 4% ahead of last year , are headed for an alltime high at Christmas . <P> Precisely because the economy has performed so splendidly in 1964 , the Government 's policymakers realize that it will take some doing to maintain the momentum in 1965 . Last week the Commerce Department predicted that capital spending in next year 's first half will rise 8% , to an annual rate of $47.7 billion-a good gain , but not as great as this year 's 14% . The consensus of economists is that the gross national product , which rose 6.7% this year , is due for an advance of some 5% next year , to $655 billion . While that might seem satisfactory , it would neither significantly increase corporate profits nor reduce unemployment .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
