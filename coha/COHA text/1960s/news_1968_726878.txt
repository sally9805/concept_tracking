txt Britain and the United States soon will discuss with Asian nations how to fill the vacuum caused by British defense withdrawals . Australia is the country to watch . It is shortly due to receive the first of 24 swing-wing F-111 jets  --  the very plane that Britain has just decided not to buy from the United States . These planes now take on added signifi-. cance . With Britain pulling out of Singapore by the end of 1971 , and with no other British air base in Asia except Hong Kong , Australia will be the only Western power , apart from the United States , having planes with the phenomenal speed , range , and power of the F-111 's . In prospect now are British discussions on letting someone  --  perhaps Australia  --  use the Island of Gan , in the Maldives . There is an airstrip there with 50 people to maintain it , but no permanent base for planes . If Britain holds onto Gan , it may well allow Australian and American aircraft to use the landing field under an agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed about the F-111 's ( Australian or American ) using facilities at Singapore  --  if Singapore is willing . In short , American friendship with Australia , already strong , is likely to become more so . Labor Department officials have fanned out across the country to explain a new program to their local administrators . It 's called VV1P . These new initials , which official Washington is just learning to recognize , stand for Work Incentive Program . Its impact ultimately will effect a major revolution in welfare programs . This controversial new plan , written into the social-security laW , insists that able-bodied people on welfare must take the jobs that the government provides for them , or else their welfare checks will be cut off . Their families , however , would continue to receive a certain amount of support . Many of these are mothers with small children . The laW provides for day-care centers while mothers are working . The program is expected to enroll 757,000 welfare recipients by the end of 1972 . By then the cost of putting these people to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $476 million saved from the checks that would have been sent to them as welfare recipients . ? This net cost of $365 million is expected to be reduced further as former dole-takers get regular jobs and become taxpayers . The idea of the program , written right into the law , is to help individuals acquire " a sense of dignity , self-worth , and confidence . " American balance-of-payments setbacks may end up improving the plight of the United States merchant marine . Anyway , the Pentagon can be expected to emphasize these current economic difficulties in arguing for more concern over the state of United States shipping . Navy sources contend that payments to foreign shipping lines constitute a serious dollar drain  --  particularly in view of the vast supply needs of the war in Vietnam . The Pentagon is deeply concerned over the problems of the dwindling merchant marine . A fear is that the United States might find itself lacking vital shipping in future crises . Navy men argue that American technology and ingenuity is such that ships could be built in United States shipyards at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , through United States know-how , ships could be designed for economical operation under the American flag . How and why ... Not everyone in Congress wants to let the public know what 's going on in campaign financing . Last year an " unholy alliance " ? to use the words of Rep. Charles E. Goodell ( R ) of New York  --  kept the bipartisan clean-election bill holed up in the House Administration Committee . This year Mr. Goodell and his cosponsor , Rep. Robert T. Ashmore ( D ) of South Carolina , have vowed to force the reform measure out of committee for an early floor vote . They want prompt action so the bill 's flnancial-disclosure clause can take effect in time for the 1968 elections . " There are some who would like to see the bill quietly fade away in committee , " Mr. Goodell says . He blames liberal Democrats and conservative Southerners . If debate can be forced out in the open , though , he predicts overwhelming House approval . The Ashmore-Goodell bill would update the outdated Corrupt Practices Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than law . " It would lift arbitrary spending ceilings but demand full reporting of campaign finances .
