Dividing the college year into three parts is beginning to look better on paper than in practice . Four years ago Florida , in hopes of handling more students without a big expansion , became the first and only state to adopt the trimester statewide . Last week , bowing to professorial discontent and the wishes of Governor Haydon Burns , Florida decided to drop it . <P> The major complaint of faculty members at the five Florida campuses was that they could not cram their previous 16-week semester courses into the 14-week trimesters without shortchanging students . " Education is not a 60-yard dash-it should be approached and savored , " said one Florida State professor , who contended that under the trimester his students were " confused and stunned by the lightning speed of things . " Some students agreed . " It 's like trying to drink water from a high-pressure fire hose , " said one . <P> Less altruistically , professors contend that although they got an 11% pay increase to shift from a nine-month year to ten months , they find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being " out of step with the rest of the academic world , " find it tough to mesh their summer study plans with the requirement that each must work half of each summer trimester . <P> A different obstacle turned up in another big trimester experiment . A Ford Foundation study of the financial jam at the University of Pittsburgh recently blamed Pitt 's trimester system as mainly responsible for doubling operational costs per student . While Pitt retained 70% of its faculty to handle the summer trimester , only one-fourth of its undergraduate enrollment showed up . A study at the Binghamton campus of the State University of New York showed that year-round operation , designed to handle about 50% more students , attracted almost no increase . <P> The trimester is not yet dead . About 55 colleges now use it , and some , including the University of Michigan , find that it is working well . Most colleges - about 1,780-remain on the semester system , while more than 300 operate on the year-round quarterly system that Florida will go to in 1967.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
