" I 've got a way to blow up Detroit . " With this intriguing line , a man in U.S. Air Force uniform introduced to his American and Canadian associates a plan that might conceivably occur some day to some strategist in the Kremlin . All the Russians would have to do , he explained , would be to start an intercontinental missile on its way to Michigan , then call up President Kennedy babbling apologies , saying that a terrible mistake had been made , the wrong button had been pushed , please excuse the noise . What should the NORAD command advise the President to do ? What could be done ? <P> Moon Phantoms . That scene , televised on the most recent installment of CBS 's Armstrong Circle Theater. , illustrated how the officers who man the nation 's vital air defenses keep their wits honed on hypothetical problems . But the most chilling moment in the hour came when the program re-created the actual events of the night of Oct. 5 , 1960 , when more than a hundred unknown objects appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the U.S. A missile barrage was apparently coming from the U.S.S.R. , and the boys in the back room were actually thinking of using the " hot line " telephone to advise Washington to retaliate . <P> But there was something odd . The computers showed no point of origin for the objects and predicted no impact points . As the minutes ticked away , the NORAD commander made his decision : it was not a missile attack . Later investigation showed that the apparent missile tracks were being caused by new and unexpectedly powerful radar installations , bouncing signals off the moon . <P> It was an absorbing and graphically instructive show , mixing dramatic elements with documentary narrative to explain the complex radar and command system that is ready to alert the U.S. and Canada if the Soviet Union should attack . By using this technique , the fortnightly Armstrong Circle Theater has established itself as one of television 's better programs . Armstrong calls its shows " actuals , " that is , semi-documentary dramatizations of real situations or events . This week , the show 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records and albums : counterfeiters cost U.S. record companies some $20 million a year in lost sales , foisting onto the record-buying public hundreds of thousands of low-quality imitations that resemble the real thing . <P> Babies to Swindlers . After starting as a straight dramatic show in TV 's infancy , Armstrong Circle Theater developed its semi-documentary format six years ago , has since covered every sort of theme . from Lizzie Borden to Hurricane Diane . Sometimes hinged to news events-the sinking of the Andrea Doria , the 1959 discovery of the B-24 that was lost in the Libyan desert during World War II-the program has also treated myriad sociopsychological problems , from parole to suicide , gambling , divorce , and legal and illegal adoption of babies . But most of all , it fingers every sort of crook-stock market swindlers , antique swindlers , smugglers , moonshiners , forgers-and tells how they operate , in fascinating documented detail .
