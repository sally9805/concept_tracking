Scotland 's Jackie Stewart is something of a brooding fatalist . His elder brother Jimmy preceded him as a racing driver but retired after two serious accidents and a near-fatal collision in the 1954 Le Mans classic . In 1968 his roommate and closest friend , the incomparable Jim Clark , was killed in a crash on the Hockenheim circuit . " The loss of Jimmy was an enormous blow , " says Stewart , " but it could n't make me give up racing . Jimmy was a professional , and so am I. " <P> And few are better . This year Stewart , 30 , has replaced King James as the Scottish ruler of the road . Last March , in the South African Grand Prix , first of the 1969 world championship Formula I series races , he roared into the lead on the very first lap , and has rarely been behind since . In the most astonishing driving display in Grand Prix history , Jackie raced his 430-h.p . Matra-Ford M580 to victories in Spain , The Netherlands and France . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced him to drop out one-third of the way through the race ; at that point he held an extravagant 30-sec. lead . Two weeks ago , he won his fifth victory in five finishes in Great Britain 's rugged 246-mile Grand Prix at Silverstone . That race gave Stewart a total of 45 world-championship points . His nearest rival , New Zealander Bruce McLaren , has only 17 . With a full five Grand Prix races yet to run , the flippant , flamboyant Scot has virtually sewn up racing 's most coveted prize . <P> Cutting Corners . Stewart invites comparison with Clark for more reasons than a heritage of heather ; Europeans consider him a " natural " driver , as they did Clark . Accurate and adaptable , he consistently picks the most efficient curb-shearing line around corners , which gives him an extra jump into the straightaway . At Silverstone , he crashed his car during a trial run , and had to race in a slightly inferior model usually driven by a teammate . On top of that , his clutch jammed on the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80 . Yet his average speed of 127.25 m.p.h. was nearly 10 m.p.h. faster than the existing track record-set in 1967 by Clark . <P> Stewart 's father ran a small garage near Dumbarton , and his mother was a lively lady who liked to roam the moors in modified sports cars . After her first son 's ill-starred attempts at a racing career , though , she had no intention of letting Jackie get behind the wheel . The young man did not much care ; he was too busy pursuing his first love-trap shooting . " I put more effort into it than I put now into my racing , " he recalls . Between 1957 and 1962 he won the Irish , Welsh , English and British champion ships and was named as a substitute to the British Olympic trap team . Finally persuaded to race at Charterhall , where Clark had made his start several years earlier , Stewart finished third . To fool his mother , he says , " I snuck out to race under the nom de plume of A. N. Other . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
