Few members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee followed its televised hearings on Viet Nam more closely than the junior Senator from New York , who is not even a member of William Fulbright 's debating society . As the interrogation droned on , Robert F. Kennedy restlessly paced his Washington office , occasionally caught himself talking back to the screen . Bothering Bobby was his belief that Administration spokesmen were dodging a key question : What role should the Viet Cong play during a peace conference ? And afterward ? <P> Finally , Kennedy set a squad of speechwriters to work on that unmooted issue , stayed up to polish their prose until 3 o'clock in the morning and at noon delivered his minority opinion at a well-attended press conference . When somebody asked him what he aimed to do next with his proposals , Kennedy said with a grin : " I guess I 'll take them home and show them to my wife . " <P> Heavy Artillery . Perhaps the Senator should have done that in the first place . As it was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The uproar was provoked by Kennedy 's statement that the allies should allow the Viet Cong " a share of power and responsibility " in Saigon 's government . " If negotiation is our aim , " he had said , " we must seek a middle ground . A negotiated settlement means that each side must concede matters that are im portant in order to preserve positions that are essential . " In other words , one way to end the war might be to guarantee in advance that the Communist guerrillas would be seated in a coalition government . <P> The Administration , which maintains that it is self-defeating to make any concessions in advance of negotiations , called in the heavy artillery . Under Secretary of State George Ball said the idea would lead " in a very short time " to a Communist government in Saigon . White House Adviser McGeorge Bundy reminded Bobby of what his late brother had said in a 1963 Berlin speech : " I am not impressed by the opportunities open to popular fronts throughout the world . I do not believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Nations Ambassador Arthur Goldberg warned against giving up " all your points in advance " of negotiations . <P> No Beards . The heaviest barrage of all came from Vice President Hubert Humphrey in New Zealand , who took time out from his Asian tour to liken Kennedy 's proposal to " a prescription which includes a dose of arsenic , " putting " an arsonist in a fire department , " and , for good measure , setting " a fox in a chicken coop . " <P> Editorial reaction was less than sympathetic to Kennedy . New York Times Columnist C. L. Sulzberger concluded that " both Peking and Hanoi must have gained fresh encouragement by the joining of our Know-Nothings with our Know-It-Alls . " Kennedy , he observed cuttingly , would have been " more honest to suggest abandoning Viet Nam without even bothering to negotiate . "
