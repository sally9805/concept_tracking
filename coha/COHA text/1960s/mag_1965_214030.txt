To a blare of brass and a gathering bloodbeat of drums , the dancers in the two long lines-men on one side , women opposite-hop forward , jump back , hop-hop-hop ahead , and then kiss-kiss-kiss . After that , both lines shift right so that new partners pucker into view for the next round of " letkiss , " the non-dance craze that has Munich on tiptoe . <P> Purists and prudes insist the last labial touch should be a chaste left-right-left to the cheek .

The rhythms of letkiss are adapted from an old Finnish round dance called letkajenka , first popularized in Paris last December through a recording by Finnish Bandleader Anton Letkiss . Somewhere between the predawn unpronounceableness of letkajenka and the similarity of Anton 's surname , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced that because of its nearly English name , letkiss is yet another happy American import . <P> Letkiss has already been blasted from the pulpit in Munich , and because of an incipient Asian-flu epidemic in Europe , has been denounced by doctors as a germ-spreading menace .

" Now the solitary dancer , surrendering entirely to the beat , communes not only with the partner but with the entire group of revelers , " says Dance Instructor Gertrude Schmidt . " Letkiss culminates in the kind of intimacy that previously would have shocked everyone . " <P> But as far as most of Munich was concerned , it was live and let live , kiss and letkiss.
