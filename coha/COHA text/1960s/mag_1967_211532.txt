Feelings of Loss <P> <P> Sir : My feeling of a very real loss in the death of Henry Luce has been eased , in part , by your cover tribute March 10 . His great spirit , which you have so beautifully conveyed , gives a reassuring faith for all of us engaged in communications . <P> EVERETT EASTER JR . <P> Manhattan <P> <P> Sir : Had Henry Luce been the publisher of any other magazines , TIME would have carried his picture on its cover several times over the years . And the cover stories that should have been written about him would have been inspirational to men and women of all ages and classes . <P> DONALD J. LEEHEY <P> Bellevue , Wash . <P> <P> Sir : I have read every issue of TIME almost from its beginning . I always wished I could meet Mr. Luce , though I never expected to . But I read about him and about his activities , and I considered him one of the influential men of our age . <P> WILLIAM F. CLOSSON <P> Croton-on-Hudson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am sure , appreciates more than does TIME the fact that life is what great individuals make it . The greatest are those , like Mr. Luce , who create something bigger than themselves as personalities-something that possesses , in effect , immortality . Usually it is an idea . In the case of Mr. Luce , it has been the infinite appreciation of , devotion to and development of the English language as the most powerful , most subtle , most beautiful , most versatile language in the world . <P> DAVID PASCAL WRAY <P> Haines City , Fla . <P> <P> Sir : It is often lamented that America has no ideology to offer the world . I submit that in his contribution to a 1964 symposium on food and civilization , Mr. Luce formulated not an ideology but a set of ideals attainable by the rest of the world , not under the yoke of the U.S. but by its side . Wrote Mr. Luce : <P> " Is there any political style which is best for all men ? I believe there is . Constitutional government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of man being an unstable mixture of freedom and fallibility , of selfishness and generosity . Constitutional government seeks to give maximum play to the freedom of the " individual while at the same time establishing the necessary restraints and evoking a sense of social cooperation . " <P> JOSEPH P. MUNZENRIDER <P> Seattle <P> <P> Guaranteed Second Strike <P> <P> Sir : " Deterrence by Anti-Missiles " Feb. 24 left unsaid what must have been a central consideration in the Soviets ' decision to deploy an operational ABM system . Soviet planners can not have escaped the realization that our growing fleet of nuclear-powered ballistic-missile submarines represents a challenge to their security entirely unmatched by their offensive or defensive arsenal . These submarines " on station " give the U.S. a guaranteed second-strike capability , a force in being that could reasonably be expected to survive the first blow and retaliate . I believe that the Soviets feel compelled to fashion some sort of " reply " to the FBM submarine fleet ; American planning should assume that the U.S.S.R. will press on with an ABM program . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee , Md . <P> <P> Cracks in the Code <P>
