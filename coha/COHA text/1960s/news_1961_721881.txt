Puts Value at 28 Million At his meeting with correspondents , Castro discussed everything from his opinion of President Kennedy to the brand of socialism in Cuba . Castro was noncommittal on the advisability of a possible meeting with the President . Castro estimated the value of 500 bulldozers at $28,000,000 . To allay fears that the bulldozers could be used for military purposes , he said he would be willing to take the smaller tractors but at the same total value . ( The 28 million dollar total is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 500 small farm tractors . ) This proposal apparently was made at a three hour and 40 minute negotiating session between Castro and the four-man technical group appointed by the Tractors for Freedom committee , which arrived here yesterday .
