For month after nervous month , Elizabeth Taylor kept Eddie Fisher at arm 's length as a kind of singing duck . It would never do to dump him , not while Richard Burton was still resisting . If Taylor had divorced Fisher and Burton had gone back to Sybil , Taylor would have lost ten-tenths of her pretty face . But if the affair had collapsed while both were still married , then it would have been just another office romance . <P> With Burton 's divorce two weeks ago , Eddie 's usefulness ended ; and Elizabeth Taylor almost immediately began to complain to the press that Fisher was in the way , that he was slowing things up , and that he was holding out for a payoff of more than $1,000,000 . <P> Hearing this in Las Vegas , Fisher exploded . " I would n't stand in the way of this earth-shattering , world-shaking romance for anything in the world , " he said . " I tried for months to get Elizabeth on the phone to say let 's get it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of a sudden I 'm supposed to be standing in the way of the marriage of this lovely young couple who have been going together for so long . " <P> Questionable Washday . " Legal matters take time , and the great lovers will just have to bear up a few more days or maybe weeks , " Eddie went on . " They stamp their feet , and if they do n't get what they want , the world must stop . They 're acting like a couple of kids in a playpen . They 've been in their playpen long enough . They can wait a few days . " <P> As for his reported insistence on a $1,000,000-plus settlement , it was just not true . In fact , said Eddie , he had no clear idea what sort of divorce settlement Elizabeth wanted . " I 'm not objecting to giving up anything . The one thing I 'd like to give up is my marriage certificate . I 'm willing for her to be happy with Richard the Lionhearted as soon as possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast and crew of The Night of the Iguana had long since gone home , but Liz and Burton , who had no home to go to , were still there . Richard the Lionhearted , taking regular Harry Truman constitutionals , paced briskly along with members of the press in tow , covering the 1,200-meter distance from his villa to his favorite bar without even getting winded . Assuming a quick finish to the Fisher business , when would he become the fifth Mr. Taylor ? " Probably about January 20 . " Why wait ? " There will be a few days ' delay arranging the wedding , and also for the sake of decorum-what little decorum is left now . " <P> On Christmas Day , Burton and his fiancee passed out some $500 worth of toys to the children of Puerto Vallarta . But most of the day Burton spent away from the public eye , in the bosom of his new family : Elizabeth 's forever proud and beaming mother , and her father ( whose usual expression is uncertainty ) , and her brother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael Wilding , and her little girl by Mike Todd , and the little German girl she adopted two years ago , and Taffy , her little yipping Sealyham . <P> Before the door shut behind the family group , someone asked Elizabeth to comment on the bold protestations of Eddie Fisher . " Please , " she said , " do not spoil my Christmas . "
