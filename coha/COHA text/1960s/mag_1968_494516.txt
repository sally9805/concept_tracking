Experiments In Learning by Joseph Featherstone st year in these pages ( August ro , September 2 , September 9 ) , I reported on certain classroom practices , styles of teaching and learning , now spreading throughout the better infant schools in Britain . What follows is a different sort of report , a series of reflections on attempts to continue this style of education in British junior schools dealing with older children . ( Infant schools take children from five to seven , teaching beginning reading and math , among other things ; junior schools take them from seven to Li . ) The approach I earlier described is by no means as widespread at the junior level ; good schools in a handful of the leading educational authorities are playing dazzling variations on the free themes worked out with younger children , but junior schools of the quality now becoming relatively common at the infant level are still rare . Why this is so is worth pursuing . I hope I can suggest some useful answers . Part of what follows will be about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts of ordinary teachers to pursue , not always successfully , a common idea of what good teaching might be . In this report I want to focus fairly narrowly on junior schools that encourage children 's free writing . The variety of writing in infant schools is not matched by many junior schools . It is depressing to go from a superb infant school to a mediocre junior school , where the children 's confidence in themselves crumbles under the weight of anxieties , drills , and the boredom of rote learning . But a growing number of junior schools are encouraging free writing . What they are attempting is scarcely new ? able teachers have always set children to writing , and isolated American teachers right this moment are no doubt shutting the classroom door and telling the kids to write their heads off . The significance of what is happening in some British junior schools is simply that a lot of ordinary teachers are becoming convinced that it is important for primary school children to write on subjects of their own choosing . Though in many cases this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very different set of priorities for teaching young children than those that prevail in this country and many parts of Britain . Everything begins at the infant level , of course . A big part of what we call the reading program is a writing and talking program . Before they can read , kids are dictating captions and stories to teachers and learning to write them , developing a written vocabulary along with their reading vocabulary . This has many advantages : a child is apt to be interested in what he has to say even though primers and beginning books bore him ; there is less class or racial bias to his own material , and the vocabulary will be suitable , because it 's his own . Beginning writing is an excellent way to get a good background in phonics  - -  -  it 's becoming increasingly clear that phonics is important - as well as to pick up a working vocabulary of sight words . Good infant teachers say that lots of reading and talking are an essential part of developing the writing : thus , within limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other , and classrooms are filled with all kinds of books , not textbooks . When I speak of writing by five-to-eight-year-olds , I 'm not talking about great literary efforts . Some children write strings of simple sentences that are barely literate , every sentence beginning with " and , " like the first attempts at popular writing in the Middle Ages . Others are astonishingly precocious , using subordinate clauses , vivid images , and fairly intricate constructions . John Blackie , who has done a great deal to promote writing in British schools , collects some examples in his book I:msicle the Primary School . Since they are in print and accessible , I 'll quote them as typical of the ordinary infant work I 've seen , not the best or the worst . Thus a six-year-old boy : " We are going to see a film this afternoon . It is about Boys town in India . We have brought some money to see it . I gave Lewis a penny . . Or a seven-year-old : " Once upon a time there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nrw Rural , to with long hair at Christmas she wolk up and saw a doll just as she wanted with king hair She played with it all day then at night she put it in a shoe box and forgot to take it upstairs with her in the morning Readers will note how few serious spelling errini. there are . What marks the writing in the better infant schools is sincerity and liveliness : the reader is being told something d writer really wanted to iiay . In the junior , 3chuoI , as in the infant school , muil of the early writing is finished the same day or even in the same period as the children start it . ( Junior schools are more likely to divide the clay into periods . ) Gradually the lime for writing can be extended . There , too , children alternate between small reports on their own experiences ? including thing ; they 've done ln science and math -- and stories which often take their themes and heroes i rem television and adyentcre stories , , and , less often , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven year olds are more apt to shi.n.v literary influences in their writing , picking up the tricks of any writer they happen to be reading . A fery children , like literary hacks , get used to standard ! ormulas . For this reason , teachers who are serious about writing , try to steer children away , from stet ies Of the " Once upon a time " sort , at least at the outset . Schools that require certain therue , .. , tend to gel Lierivative and artificial work . The floe den Report , Children and Their Priwqry Schools holds no brief for teachers who force children into " stock phrases and insincerity by setting them to write on the conveittional subject : the walk in spring , the autobiography of a penny , the loaf of bread , or the tree , which may culminate in ' I am happy as a table , but I was happiest as a tree . ' " Teachers concerned with quality try to make .. 77,11c that writing doe-t n't become a chore ; they are reluctant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If children are to write freely , many say , it is important to let them choose what can be read aloud , or what s only for the eyes of a teacher or a friend , or what is secret , the property of the audio- , When children . ire confident enough in their teachers encourage them to make " hooks : " with folded pieces of paper and slightly thicker covers . Some classes have a blg display rack for these hooks , which children browse through and read according to their tastes . The books contatin considerable personal ing , some poetry ( usually unrhymed ) , stories , aco.00tts of math and science projects , and topics of one sort t'T another that children choose ? from caveman to holthies .

Where there is , they do Mr. A. B. Clegg , the chief education officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his authority into a fascinating collection called Tire E.-t-ct , . , u , . : 711 of Writing . Since I wish school authorities ire thr ; country world take a good long look at this book , I 'll quote from a few typical selections . Here 's a boy , 10 : " I can remembet that boar l wal:ec.1 on the sands by a very rough sea . - flu : waves crashed down so hard i could feel the trernHling of them on me . It sounded like bricks tunitiiling dcwn from an old hoose when , it is being knocked down .... " Here 's a girl , 11 : We set out , Mummy : fro : : I , we were going into the town . I was delighted , for I 1A gas to have a pair of 1 ow shoes , they were . o be for school . When tive ' . lot to the town wis went inti. ) a shoe shop . I saw a few pairs of shoe ; Out I did n't : Like any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' shoes brown and Mummy liked them . I loohed at her in horror enable to speak surely , surd she would n't bits deem . But the purchase was complete she had bought them . I pinched myself to make sure it was n't a dream , unluckily for : no it was n't . . This 10-year-old , writ about a candle : White polish ; sour milk , Deiicate linger wrapped lr cotton blanket . Siar growing , bigger bi biD ; t2r flickering in darkness , A great Lord , now a humble person bowing . Golden crystals , dark eve . Slowly , flowing , running , milk . Faint glimmer of hope , trytag to enlarge itself . Black burned pie ; all beaLtLy gone . The writing teachers get inevitably reflects their concerns . There are impresarios , hustling formidable feats of child-writing they inspire you with a seH. - righteous itch to remind them that the job is to help a kid clung and not promote an author . ( As Mr. Clegg wisely points out , what gets written in any school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the develo:nnent of the child himself . ) There are Miss Jean brodies who encourage marvelous fairy tales , t. poetry tantasies , and all k:nd : . ; of - creative " writing , but who ignore precise and elegant math and science reporting going on light noSor their noses . In writing , as in , : ether matters , it is dLficult to exaggerate the extent to which schools ever : where are bearers of the genteel culture and its class biases . Still , where local author.ties and principals have encouraged free writ. - ing , it is impressive to see how many teachers do learn to respect the content of children 's writing without being shocked or disapproving or niggling about inessential errors . ( The students of emancipated teachers produce writings about sex and life in the raw , some of which is true . ) Writing is getting across what you have to say , and the teachers in the best classes I saw tried to treat mistakes in grammar , spelling , and messiness , as obstacles to communication . They let slips go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in classes of 40 or so , but watching good teachers , you begin to see that the priorities are clear : it is easier to help children with language if you have a basis for diagnosing what you need to know . In part , you get the raw material for a diagnosis from writing . You also find out more if the classroom routine is arranged so that you can listen and watch and , at least occasionally , talk with a child . A lot of teachers try to correct all mistakes in sessions with a child . There is no point in scribbling red marks over somebody 's personal statement . John Blackie has an ugly story of a nine-year-old whose theme , " My Father , " told about his dead parent . The teacher 's only written comment was : " Tenses . You keep mixing past and present . " Nowhere is it clearer than in correcting that a central part of teaching is relationships between people , which are always impossible to speak of in a general way . The finest analytical nets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more than they will deliver up pure specimens of friendship or love . We are condemned to rough impressions , which nearly always float up to the level of platitudes , about as useful as advising people not to take any wooden nickels . Still , for what it 's worth , good teachers pay sen ... s attention to the content , the subject of the piece of writing ( or the painting or whatever ) . There is this bond of interest between them and the children . Children .. , 0e1I1 very interested in finding out if a meaning has come across and what the reader feels about it , and many are quite ready to accept criticism . If it 's an unfinished story , the teacher inquires how it 's going to end . He asks how the child came to choose this subject . He makes an effort to talk thoughtfully about specific details , asking when , how , why . Sometimes he 'll want to know if the writer is pleased with his work , and if he answers no , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on how it could be better . All rules of thumb fall away before the rule that says the worst thing is to discourage future work . There is never enough teaching to go around . Teachers try to enlist the children to do some of the correcting ? many ask the class to spot errors in the " books " or other writings on display in the room andbring them to the attention of the author , who can then make the corrections himself . The work of good junior schools runs increasingly against the grain of the British educational system as the children get older . Even in very free junior schools , a visitor sometimes notices the decline of the superb work of the first few years as children are tuned up for examinations . Competition for university places is keen in England , and most of your fate still rests on getting into the right secondary school . This is not the whole story , and I 'll return to this point later ; what I want to emphasize now is the way that what is taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American schools . There are plenty of exceptions ? enough to make me doubt that the process is inevitable , Most of them are in authorities where free methods have become a reigning orthodoxy . Still , it is depressing to see good schools succumbing to the idea that there is a separate subject called " English , " and giving the children spelling lists , workbooks , and grammar exercises , as though anybody ever learned much that way . In a school where children 's writing is well supervised there is no place for grammar and spelling as distinct subjects . It is absurd to think that if a child can take somebody else 's sentences to pieces and label the parts he will write better ones of his own . Correctness comes from using the language and hearing it used under sound guidance . People learn to write correctly by writing , not by plowing through mountains of workbooks . There is no general formula that fits all schools that encourage good writing . Mr. Clegg makes a stab in the right direction when he says that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they learn than what they learn . The same attitude that led them to encourage free writing led them to stop grouping classes by ability ( tracking here , " streaming " in England ) First-hand experience stimulates good written work ; and for at least part of the day in most of the schools , children are given choices about what to do . This is all vague . So is what the teachers presiding over the best classes said . They all said that children write for people they trust , and they do n't write freely until they can talk with confidence ; and , except for the work of certain born storytellers , most of their best writing comes from things they experience directly . I thought of asking them what their position was on wooden nickels but then decided that these truisms were in fact true . There is no getting around them . If we want the kind of schools where children write freely ? which is not something separate , but only an emblem , after all , for a whole way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no shortcuts .
