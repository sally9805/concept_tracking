On the tip of a narrow Uruguayan peninsula separating the mouth of the River Plate from the Atlantic Ocean lies Punta del Este . a resort town that comes to life only in the South American summer . Last week the temperature hovered at 52 in the South American winter , but Punta del Este was hardly deserted . Platoons of security agents swarmed through the town , and squads of workmen were everywhere , repairing streets , painting walls , planting flowers . <P> Cause of the activity was a special meeting of the economic ministers of the Latin American nations , called by the U.S. to hammer into shape President Kennedy 's Alliance for Progress , the most vital aid program in the history of the hemisphere . At the start of the conference this week , Treasury Secretary C. Douglas Dillon , leading the U.S. delegation , will propose a generous , but often stern , program . Even the minimums are staggering . To help raise the per capita income in each country by 2.5% a year , the U.S. intends to pour $1.3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only a beginning . The U.S. program also calls for stabilizing world market prices of the commodities on which many Latin American economies depend . It encourages setting up common markets to spur exports and thus production . It demands effective social reforms such as land reform and graduated income taxes that would help to narrow the all-too-wide gap between the indifferent rich and the suffering poor . <P> The detailed U.S. proposal was sent to the 19 Latin American nations ( all save the Dominican Republic ) that are scheduled to participate in the alliance . That aid is needed , all are agreed . The question is how much . Many Latin Americans fear that even the generous U.S. commitment will not be enough to achieve its high goals , particularly the aim to raise the per capita income by 2.5% a year . Such a feat , they say , could only be accomplished by pouring in $3 billion-perhaps $6 billion - worth of U.S. aid each year . <P> The U.S. is fully aware that government aid money alone can not provide what Latin America needs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion a year . But U.S. businessmen are reducing , not increasing , their stakes , sent only $95 million in net direct capital south of the border last year ( v. $1.1 billion in the peak year 1957 ) . Even more disheartening is the record of Latin American investors themselves , who have withdrawn an estimated $11 billion from their needy continent since World War II . <P> As it prepared for Punta del Este , the U.S. was betting that once a dynamic aid program gets under way , the current crisis of confidence will end . It must , if the alliance is to succeed .
