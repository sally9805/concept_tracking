It was a meeting of a rather special elite . Eleven of the 16 surgeons who have performed heart transplants gathered last week in Cape Town to consider what they had done , what they should do , and how they could do better . Why Cape Town ? Explained Brooklyn 's Dr. Adrian Kantrowitz : " Chris Barnard has been doing it better than all of us-that 's why we are here . " Barnard 's aura was rivaled by the authority of Houston 's Dr. Denton Cooley , who has three surviving patients , including one who is going back to work . <P> When Is Death ? One question on which the surgeons spent little time was the most basic of all : Are heart transplants morally justified ? Since all the principals at the symposium had performed transplants , they had answered this question long ago in their own minds . But there remained some sticking points in medical ethics . How to determine the death of the donor ? On three criteria there was general agreement : The patient must no longer have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beyond that , he must have a " flat " electroencephalogram-no " brain wave " activity-but for how long ? After the closed sessions in Cape Town , all that Spokesman Cooley could say was : " We have reached some agreement as to the nature of brain death . " <P> <P> The second ethical-medical question was : How to select the recipient for a transplant ? Most operations so far have been performed on men with advanced and long-standing heart disease . In such cases , it seems that a new heart may be wasted on a patient with negligible chances of survival . But can a doctor , in good conscience , pass over the man who is most severely ill and doomed soon to die , in favor of a younger man with more vitality , whose need is less urgent but who has a better chance of survival ? On this score , said Cooley , " We did not establish definite criteria . " <P> There have been only 25 human-heart transplants , with seven patients surviving-too small a sample for many firm conclusions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best surgical technique is that devised by Stanford University 's Dr. Norman E. Shumway Jr. , in which part of the recipient 's old heart is left in place to reduce the number of blood-vessel connections needed and to protect the heart 's electrical system . There was also surprising unanimity on the desirability of getting transplant patients out of bed and walking within 48 hours after their operations . <P> New Star . The area of deepest ignorance and most hopeful new reports covered the problem of protecting the implanted heart against rejection . Here the star turned out to be not a surgeon but a drug , forbiddingly named antilymphocyte globulin , or ALG . <P> What is ALG ? It is the nearest thing to a natural medication yet found to suppress the mechanism by which the body seeks to reject any foreign protein implanted in it . By that mechanism , the human system produces antibodies that attack the proteins in the transplants . The antibodies are made or transported by white blood cells , or lymphocytes , which multiply astronomically in the presence of foreign tissue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
