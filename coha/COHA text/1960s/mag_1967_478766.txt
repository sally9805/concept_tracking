By most standards , Richard M. Nixon today is a successful man . His name leads all the rest on the door of a prestigious New York law firm , Nixon , Mudge , Rose , Guthrie , Alexander , &; Mitchell , now one of the nation 's ten largest , with offices spread over four floors of a Wall Street skyscraper . The clients include Pepsi-Cola ; Warner-Lambert Pharmaceutical ; General Precision Equipment ; General Cigar ; Cargill ( a firm that has sold large quantities of wheat to the Soviet Union , a transaction that Nixon is politically against ) ; American Bulk Carriers ( for whom the Nixon firm has registered in Washington as a paid lobbyist ) ; Newfoundland Pulp and Chemical ; and Mitsui , the Japanese trading combine . The most senior partners of the firm earn from $150,000 to $250,000 a year and Nixon 's income tax is now double the salary he earned as Vice President . Attorney Nixon sits on the boards of directors of important companies , such as the Harsco Corporation ; Mutual of New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance field ; and Minneapolis-based Investors Diversified Services , the giant mutual fund with net assets of over $5.3 billion . He belongs to impressive in-town clubs ? the Metropolitan , the exclusive Links , and the Recess , a Wall Street luncheon club with a panoramic viewof lower Manhattan ; and fashionable country clubs ? Blind Brook in Westchester , Baltusrol in New Jersey . When he travels abroad the Duke and Duchess of Windsor entertain in his honor , and his wife is seen at Pierre Cardin 's latest showing . His daughters attend the best Eastern women 's colleges and have had well-publicized debuts . When he leaves his 24th-floor corner office , filled with the autographed pictures of heads of states , keys to cities , and other memorabilia , his chauffeur drives him home to a ten-room cooperative apartment which cost him $100,000 , plus a yearly maintenance fee of $9,600 . The windows in the high-ceilinged living room face Central Park and the fireplaces are woodburning . Other tenants are Nelson Rockefeller and William Randolph Hearst , Jr . This could be a nice life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transition from Presidential candidate to Wall Street lawyer with ease and has aged elegantly . But Richard Nixon never goes to the stylish country clubs to which he pays dues , never takes in New York 's theater or opera , never even attends the sports events that he enjoys . For major chunks of each year he circles the globe , poking his head into trouble-spots on personal fact-finding junkets , looking into situations that intrigue him , while restoring his credentials as a foreign-policy expert . For other chunks of each year he circles the United States , eating hamburgers alone in hotel rooms , talking in private to Republican functionaries and in public to the party 's rankand-file , while restoring his credentials as a political leader . After his unsuccessful try for the California governorship in 1962 , Nixon moved to New York , not to keep his Presidential hopes alive , as one columnist mysteriously hinted , but because he had been totally demolished in politics . So , at least , it seemed . This was not the first time that he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through in national politics . In 1948 , his closest friends thought he was signing his political death warrant by taking up Whittaker Chambers ' charges against Alger Hiss . In 1952 , when the " Nixon fund " story broke , Thomas Dewey and other top Eisenhower advisers told him bluntly to get off the ticket . In 1960 , having survived a minor challenge to his nomination , he proceeded to lose a Presidential campaign which most Republican politicians thought he should have won , and by a margin so close that the second-guessers had a field day at his expense . In 1962 , incredibly , he lost the governorship of California to Democratic incumbent Edmund G. ( Pat ) Brown . The morning after the election he wrote his own political obituary by bitterly attacking the press . " Just think how much you 're going to be missing , " he told the assembled reporters . " You wo n't have Nixon to kick around anymore because , gentlemen , this is my last press conference ... " But he was alive again in 1964 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presidential primaries ; for Nixon himself to mount a last-minute drive for the nomination ; and even , for a time , to consider a bid to be Vice President . All failed , and in January 1966 Nixon told William Lawrence of ABC News . " As a practical political realist , I do not expect to be a nominee again . " Yet fourteen months later , in March 1967 , a group of reputable and well-financed Republican Stephen Hess , former staff assistant to President Eisenhower , will be a fellow at the Institute of Politics , John F. Kennedy School of Government , Harvard University , in the coming academic year . David Rroder is national political reporter and columnist for the Washington " Post . " This article was adapted from their forthcoming book , " The Republican Establishment , " which Harper it Row will publish on October 25. professionals announced the formation of a " Nixon for President Committee , " whose chairman asserted with confidence , " When the time is right , we will have a candidate . " Above all else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so puzzles even seasoned Nixon-watchers . Some politicians are pleasing of face : Nixon 's looks have been likened to a Bob Hope carved out of walnut . Some politicians are entertaining : Nixon is basically a serious , even studious person , a grind . And nobody likes a grind . He has not won public office in his own right for seventeen years . He has not held public office for seven years . Since his move to New York , he has been virtually a stateless person politically . And yet he persists . He persists because there are two things in Nixon that will not be choked off , two things that even his enemies concede him . One is his intelligence , the alert , disciplined , and restless mind that has few equals in American politics . Nixon has always done his homework ; for almost 20 years now , longer than any front-rank politician in either party except Lyndon Johnson , he has been at the center of national and international affairs . Even working without a staff , which he has done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed on top of the key issues ? particularly foreign-policy issues ? and in touch with key leaders . If Nixon continues to command attention , it is in part because what he says and thinks can not be lightly dismissed . His other unquenchable quality is his energy ? an energy which this singularly persistent man expends unstintingly on politics , however remote the likelihood of its redounding to his own benefit . There , , as , for instance , the day in October 1966 when he began his final burst of campaigning for Republican Congressional candidates . For two weeks before that he had lived , breathed , talked , and thought sixteen hours a day about the case he was to argue , for the second time , before the Supreme Court . He flew from New York to Washington Tuesday morning and spent the day in court . That night , instead of having the case behind him , as he had hoped , he was reworking it again in his Washington hotel room , because he had been interrupted in mid-argument by the Court 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , scrubbed and shaved and faced the Justices for another hour of questioning and argument . The airline held the plane at National Airport for 15 minutes so he would not miss his connection in Chicago . In his few minutes at O'Hare Field , he made phone calls to three Chicago friends to check the progress of 58 WHAT KEEPS NIXON RUNNING Charles H. Percy 's campaign for the Senate . Then he flew on to San Francisco where three television crews awaited him at the airport . That took 15 minutes . He was driven to the St. Francis Hotel , where he shaved again and then faced another 35-minute press conference . Back upstairs , he had sandwiches and coffee while dictating to Rose Mary Woods , his secretary . Then he drove across the bay to Oakland and spoke for 50 minutes endowing a soon-to-be-forgotten Republican Congressional candidate with virtues his own wife never suspected he possessed , talking of Vietnam , of Lyndon Johnson , of the future of the two-party system , talking , talking , talking , with only his eyes betraying his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he drove an hour south to Palo Alto , where he talked for 15 more minutes in the midnight chill outside his motel with the two University of California law students who had been his party 's volunteer chauffeurs . His day was now twenty-one hours old and he had traveled 3,000 miles , but he was not done . Ile spent two more hours talking to his former campaign manager , Robert Finch , about the latter 's campaign for Lieutenant Governor of California . Then for three hours Richard Nixon slept . The phone awakened him for a television interview program , which preceded a Finch campaign fundraising breakfast , a flight to Bakersfield , a press conference , a rally for candidate ( now Congressman ) Bob Mathias , a flight to Burbank , another press conference , a television taping , a flight to Ontario , California , a rally for candidate ( now Congressman ) Jerry Pettis , a return flight to Burbank and , early Friday morning , a flight back to New York . A Matter of Style What kind of man pushes himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nixon has survived so long as a politician in part because so many people find him an enigma . Particularly among the intellectuals , he shares with Lyndon Johnson the distinction of always having his motives questioned . The intellectuals ' antipathy dates back to the Hiss case and Nixon 's equivocal relationship to Senator Joseph R. McCarthy . It has been reinforced by more recent incidents indicating Nixon 's insensitivity to the First Amendment , particularly in situations involving academics . What the intellectuals find it hard to concede is that Nixon , whatever his failings , has some legitimate claims ' to their respect . In foreign affairs , for example , his outlook has been firmly internationalist , including early and faithful advocacy of large-scale foreign aid ? a position that was hardly designed to win him votes . On civil rights . Nixon had the solidest record of any man in the Eisenhower Administration ? and before that , a voting record in Congress as good as John F. Kennedy 's and far better than Lyndon B. Johnson 's . Moreover , he was one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Birch Society ? again a stand that was hardly calculated to win him votes , at least in California . Also , Nixon is master of the intellectuals ' own key tools ? language and logic . His syntax is always orderly , his arguments are systematically arranged , and he even has the ability to turn a phrase . He rarely employs ghostwriters . Instead , on yellow legal-size pads he painstakingly outlines and re-outlines his speeches . Then ? once the logic . the key phrases , and transition points are firmly imbedded in his mind ? he normally throws away the notes and delivers extemporaneously . Substantively , then , it might have been possible for the intellectuals to have taken a live-and-letlive attitude toward Nixon ? as they have toward George Romney and Percy . But there is something else involved , something on which intellectuals place great emphasis ? style . Nixon 's public style is that of the college debater , small-town , rural , and lower middle class . The debater strives for points , not images . Not surprisingly , Nixon 's speeches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seven-point plan . " In an age of television , debater Nixon is geared to the big hall , not the living room . Only recently has he acquired a semblance of the light touch . Nixon 's jokes are less forced nowadays , his delivery is better and , most importantly , he has learned to poke fun at his own foibles . Ile acquired some of these arts from nne of the country 's great gag writers , Paul Keyes . They met in 1061 when Nixon appeared on the Jack Paar Show , where Keyes was a producer and writer . Keyes subsequently assumed the role of Nixon 's court jester and taught him how to make a point with a laugh , something Nixon now does with considerable skill in his speeches . Offstage , however , Nixon is a man chronically ill at ease . Small talk eludes him ; small pleasantries turn awkward in his mouth . Typical was an incident that took place in 1960 in Billings , Montana , where he and his party paused for a Sunday respite in mid-campaign . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the national reporters . Nixon , who had previously held himself aloof from the press , dropped in for a social visit and stood , drink in hand , at the center of a group of journalists . Art Ruchwald shouldered his way through the group and introduced the Vice President to two pretty stewardesses from the chartered press plane . " They 're great fans of yours , " Buchwald said . Nixon looked at the girls , and said , " Oh , are you stewardesses ? I thought you were B-girls . " No one laughed , so he added hastily , " I meant B-for-Billings girls . " Not until Nixon left did the party return to life . For Nixon , it has always been hard to appear spontaneous . On a TV telethon , for example , his assistants have had to ask him to grope occasionally for an answer . His speedy reflexes made the show look fixed . Nixon has other techniques that seem almost too perfect to be real . Thanks to some sort of psychic stopwatch he can give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cued . Television directors who work with him for the first time find it uncanny . Nixon 's mastery of technique has affected his reputation in his party and with the public . Many , in the old phrase , " think him too clever by half . " One such is a prominent Republican Senator who asked Nixon to endorse Charles H. Percy 's plan for an All-Asian Peace Conference to seek an end to the Vietnam war . Up to that time Nixon had been warning that American demands for negotiations only encouraged the enemy to keep fighting and thus prolonged the war . " But . " the Senator said . " Nixon left my office , walked into a press conference and , on the spot , constructed a better argument for the All-Asian Conference idea than I had ever heard before . The only thing that bothered me , " the Senator added , was that he probably did n't believe a word of it , " Just what Nixon believes ? in a religious sense ? is also something of an enigma . He comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jessamyn West , author of the charming collection of Quaker 64 WHAT KEEPS NIXON RUNNING stories , The Friendly Persuasion , which is about their common great-grandfather and his family . To those who identify Quakerism with pacifist and humanitarian causes , the Quakerism of Richard Nixon may seem the antithesis of what his church represents . But he has no trouble reconciling his politics with his faith . " The three passions of Quakers are peace , civil rights , and tolerance , " he says . " That 's why , as a Quaker , I ca n't be an extremist , a racist , or an uncompromising hawk . While all this may seem to be the opposite of what I 've stood for , I 'm actually consistent . " To the Aid of the Party Nixon has come to believe ? and probably correctly ? that his link with Kennedy in the 1960 campaign is an asset to him today . In 1961 , a Mrs. Gladys Steimat of Hingham , Massachusetts , wrote The Christian Science Monitor that during a televised Presidential press conference her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Kennedy , but where is his friend , Nixon ? " Friend Nixon now believes his close race with Kennedy was no disgrace ? particularly when set beside the pummeling Barry Goldwater took four years later . " That was the classic campaign of our era , " Nixon says of the 1960 contest . " It is part of everyone 's life . " Nixon ran for Governor of California in 1962 , in large part , to provide himself with an excuse not to run against Kennedy in 1964 . After Kennedy 's death , Nixon flirted briefly with a try for the 1964 nomination . When he learned that Gold-water 's nomination was inevitable and guessed ( correctly ) that his defeat , too , was almost certain , Nixon readjusted his thinking toward the goal of the 1968 nomination . He would be , first , Goldwater 's and then the entire party 's Loyal Helper , loyal in the face of adversity in 1964 and tireless in his effort to achieve recovery which he correctly forecast would come in 1966 . When Goldwater was criticized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " extremism in defense of liberty . . . " line , it was Nixon who made it possible for Goldwater to explain , without embarrassment , what he had really meant . When the Goldwater managers finally awoke in August to the need for some gesture of party unity , it was Nixon again who spelled out the result of the Republican " unity conference " in Hershey , Pennsylvania . Most importantly it was Nixon who took to the road campaigning for Goldwater while other Republican leaders stayed in their home states , saying as little as possible about the national ticket . After the campaign 's disastrous end Nixon was instrumental in arranging the transfer of power from Party Chairman Dean Burch to Ray Bliss in face-saving terms for Goldwater . In classic political terms Nixon today is a displaced person , a candidate without a base of his own . As he put it himself , " Someone suggested that I get a house trailer and move around from state to state establishing residence . Then I could pick the best one as my base for 1968 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But there is something musty about this talk political bases in an age of television networks and national magazines . Barry Goldwater of Arizona ( sixteen convention votes ) easily defeated Nelson Rockefeller of New York ( ninety-six convention votes ) . Even the Governor of Rhode Island has a right to dream big . If Nixon 's name calls forth little enthusiasm in his native state of California and virtually none in his adopted state of New York , he still has , through long and arduous wooing , many political allies across the country . His strength is national , and it rests on three bases : ( 1 ) Goldwater and the conservatives , ( 2 ) Southern Republicans , and ( 3 ) the Congressmen for whom he has campaigned . Nixon 's current position as the candidate of the Republican Right is not without a certain irony . In 1960 , the New York Times noted that " the right wing tags him as a liberal . " In mid-1964 , when Nixon was urging Romney to become a candidate , the conservative National Review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " migrating with a flock of influential ( and liberal ) GOP birds . " Two prominent young Republican liberals , George Gilder and Bruce Chapman , in 1964 said that Nixon " must in the last analysis be counted with Rockefeller in the party 's progressive and moderate camp . " There is considerable ideological distance between Nixon and Goldwater . Where it took Goldwater until mid-1966 to discover that the John Birch Society had evil designs on the Republican party , Nixon drew a firm line against the Birchers in 1962 . Nixon has never come close to echoing Goldwater 's statements on social security , nuclear weapons , TVA , and other matters that kept Goldwater in so much hot water in 1964 . Nor does he share Ronald Reagan 's and Goldwater 's deep-bred and instinctive fear of bureaucracy . Indeed , Nixon does not really appear to have his heart in domestic questions . His most carefully considered speeches are on foreign policy . When he talks about Medicare or drug addiction it seems almost an afterthought ? because he is expected to say something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel he can " buy " the right to be an internationalist by taking conservative positions ondomestic issues , much as Lyndon Johnson , as a Texas Senator and Majority Leader , " bought " the right to be a liberal on some economic and international issues by taking very good care of his conservative constituents on matters like oil depletion , tidelands , and natural gas regulation . So far this strategy has worked for Nixon . His views do not unduly alarm either wing of the GOP . And for the conservatives he stands out as a man of unswerving party loyalty . " Nixon as of now would be the party choice , " Barry Goldwater said in 1966 . " He is far ahead of some candidates who deserted the ticket in 1964 . " This blessing from Mr. Conservative himself is echoed by other conservatives across the land , Making Hay in Dixie Besides the conservatives . Nixon 's second source of support is the South . But Nixon can not fairly be charged with winning this backing by pandering to racial prejudice . Early in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpreted as his bid for what later came to be called " the backlash vote . " But at the same time he supported the pending civil-rights bill . In 1965 and 1966 , as he systematically touched down in the eleven states of the Confederacy , he was at pains to make clear that he was not there to give comfort to the segregationists . In May 1966 , for example , he went to Jackson , Mississippi , to address a $100-a-plate Republican dinner ? a visit that was condemned in advance by some liberal Republicans because the Mississippi GOP platform endorsed segregation as " absolutely essential to harmonious racial relations . " Nixon was , of course . asked about this at a press conference in Jackson . He said , " I will go to any state in the country to campaign for a strong two-party system , whether or not I agree with the local Republicans on every issue .... I do not share the views of the Mississippi Republican party or elsewhere where it takes a segregationist stand . " At the banquet that night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporters , there was an integrated audience ? six Negroes and about one thousand whites ? at a regular party function . Nixon 's theme in his speech was this : " The Republican opportunity in the South is a golden one ; but Republicans must not go prospecting for thefool 's gold of racist votes . Southern Republicans must not climb aboard the sinking ship of racial injustice . They should let the Southern Democrats sink with it , as they have sailed with it . " Mississippi Republicans applauded . As one Southern GOP chairman has said : " It 's not so much what Nixon says down here that counts ; it 's what he does n't say and does n't do up North . " Unlike Rockefeller , Romney , and Percy , he has never particularly sought , received , or bragged about support from either prominent Negro leaders or large numbers of Negro voters . Unlike Rockefeller and Romney , he did not refuse to support the Republican nominee strongly backed by Southern Republicans , and unlike Percy , he never condemned Goldwater for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , Nixon has not , like the others , contented himself with lecturing the Southern Republicans from a distance ; he has been down among them in good times and bad . His close acquaintance with the region has taught Nixon something other Northern Republicans do not know Southern Republicans come in all varieties , from racist to progressive and all shades of in-between , but , to a man , they crave the respectability of approval and acceptance by the national party and its leaders , Thus , what is vital is not what Nixon says at their dinners , but the fact that he comes . In any given speech , Nixon will give them enough to agree with ? his hardline anti-Communist foreign policy , his generally conservative domestic views ? so that they can forgive him his difference with them on civil rights , where it exists . In fact , there are wide ranges of difference among Southern Republicans even on the race issue . And if the diehard Republican segregationists like Wirt Yerger , Jr. , of Mississippi support Nixon as the " least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are trying to orient their parties to a genuinely bi-racial constituency , like Robert J. Corber of Virginia , regard Nixon as the national leader who best understands and will most consistently support what they are trying to do . The influence of Goldwater and the conservatives generally in the party remains to be proven in 1968 , but the power of the South can be stated precisely : The eleven Confederate states plus Kentucky and Oklahoma will have MB delegates in 1968 ? more than any other region and well over half the 0167 needed for nomination . Some , and perhaps many , of those Nixon delegates would be siphoned off if Reagan becomes a serious candidate ; he , after all , opposes the 1964 and 1965 civil-rights acts as fully as Nixon supports them ; he 66 WHAT KEEPS NIXON RUNNING is flatly on record against state or federal open-occupancy laws , while Nixon 's position in 1967 is still unclear . But if there is no Reagan raid , Nixon can look to an almost Solid South to put him halfway to nomination . Political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to come from his third element of strength ? the Congressmen for whom he has campaigned . Nixon 's travels in every one of the last eight campaign years have been premised on the hope that he is acquiring political due bills , as well as applause . In the 1966 campaign , he was once again the busiest of his party 's national campaigners . During the Labor Day to Election Day period alone , he campaigned in thirty-five states for eighty-six Republican nominees for Governor , Senator , and Representative . The work was congenial . " I want all Republicans to win , " Nixon said . " I am just as strong for a liberal Republican in New York as I am for a conservative Republican in Texas , and I can enthusiastically campaign for both , because we need both liberals and conservatives to have a majority . " In 1966 conservative Ronald Reagan in California and liberal Edward Brooke in Massachusetts declined Nixon 's help ? hut , most Republicans welcomed him with open arms . And no wonder . His presence meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name has been on programs that have attracted between five and six million dollars to the GOP . And he also has a sure touch with the " fat cats . " He is chairman of the Congressional Republicans ' Boosters Club ( organized to raise money in chunks of $1,000 or more ) , which gathered in $1.3 million in 1966 . He even set up a little " Boosters program " of his own on the side , tapping Miss Helen Clay Frick , the elderly Pittsburgh steel heiress , for some two dozen contributions of $1,000 each , which Nixon dispatched for her to worthy Congressional candidates around the country . Given his tripartite national base ( which could be shaken if Reagan becomes a serious contender ) Nixon also enters 1968 free of certain past handicaps . A sort of informal " statute of limitations " in national politics results from the short memories of voters . Thus a set of names once firmly and emotionally tied to Richard Nixon ? like Jerry Voorhis , Helen Gahagan Douglas , and Murray Chotiner , respectively , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? now have little meaning for the average voter . And the1960 campaign against Kennedy is being turned into an asset by " Friend Nixon . " Even the disastrous " last press conference " ? tapes of which are available to the Democratic National Committee ? has been rationalized by some Nixon supporters into an asset on the theory that the outburst shows him to be " human " ? not coldly impersonal like Thomas E. Dewey . Then , too , Nixon is free of obligations that would hold him to a rigid position on any domestic issues that may arise in the campaign . Unlike Percy , he has not had to cast a record vote on any subject that has come up recently in Congress , nor is it possible to fix him with direct responsibility for anything as specific as Romney 's tax policy in Michigan or Reagan 's handling of the California university system . He can move with the currents ? entirely as political prudence dictates . Finally , his position as a party loyalist ? one who never defected from the national ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The trend toward ticket-splitting has become so pronounced in recent years that the average citizen is inclined to think that " independence " is automatically a political virtue . " I vote the man , not the party label , " is almost the first principle of the typical middle-class suburban voter . But politicians are old-fashioned and most people who arc enough involved in their party to want to he national convention delegates have a fierce party loyalty . Like the Rockefeller divorce and remarriage in the last campaign , Romney 's 1964 apostasy puts a gulf between him and the party regulars ? a breach that Nixon can exploit even if he never mentions it . Girding for the Primaries Yet much as the politicians value loyalty , they put an even higher premium on the capacity to win ? and it is the loser 's label that Nixon must shake if he is to emerge with the nomination . At the 1966 Gridiron Club dinner in Washington a character was dragged onto the stage who looked very much like Nixon . Another actor commented , " Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns out to be a towel . " To counter this image , it will be necessary for Nixon to establish " winner credentials " in the only elections open to him ? the Presidential primaries . At least four states ? New Hampshire , Wisconsin , Nebraska , and Oregon ? are likely to be Nixon-Romney battlegrounds in 1968 . Nixon carried all these states against Kennedy in 1960 ? ranging from a modest 51.8 per cent in Wisconsin to Nebraska 's 62.1 per cent , his most impressive state victory . He is girding himself for these contests , and if he can sweep them against Romney , Reagan , and Percy , there is little question that the nomination will be his . Nixon , after so many years and setbacks , is still seriously considered for the Presidency in part because of his talent for keeping his name in the news . Better than any other contemporary politician Nixon understands the mechanics of newspapering and uses his knowledge to generate copy . He knows the elements that must be present to make a story ; he knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time zones for traveling reporters ; about the unique needs of the wire services . Nixon 's extensive foreign travels have stimulated his press average . A statement that might not be newsworthy in New York takes on luster if Nixon is in Kuala Lumpur . The unsurprising announcement , NIXON WILL DO AS PARTY BIDS , was a New York Times headline on April 1 , 1964 . The dateline was Bangkok . Yet skillful as Nixon is in generating news , most Republicans think they have reason to worry about his relationships with the press . Whoever else may have forgotten the " last press conference " in 1962 , the reporters who cover Nixon have not . Since then , Nixon has worked hard to overcome his troublesome reputation for hostility and aloofness . He has , in one sense , compounded his problem . In making himself more accessible to reporters , he has also made himself more visible ? and what is perceived is Nixon the manipulator , the man of technique , not of substance . It is Nixon 's habit , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reporters aboard his plane about the political background , personalities , special issues , and particular problems of the district or state he is about to enter . The briefings are extremely useful to the press ; were he not a politician , Nixon would have made a superb political reporter , for his insights are shrewd , his information encyclopedic , and his gift for summary and exposition exceptional . But Nixon is not content to be admired . Rather than let the reporters discover for themselves how he adapts his basic speech to the situation , he goes on to say , " Now , this is a pretty conservative district , so you 'll notice I do n't bear down as heavily on . . . " or , " The Democratic incumbent here has been a very good Congressman , so I 'm going to have to stay away from personalities and concentrate more on ... " If there was ever any doubt in reporters ' minds that there is always a covert motive for anything Nixon says or does , such conversations end it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nixon find in interviewing him that he is a three-dimensional man , not a cardboard figure or tape recording of himself . By contrast they learn that interviewing Romney and Reagan , in most cases , is no different from hearing them make a public speech . Of the four Republican contenders , only Percy now has better relations with the press than Nixon , and he is largely untested . But most of all , Nixon is helped , so far as the press is concerned , by the fact that his Democratic opponent in 1968 is not John F. Kennedy but Lyndon B. Johnson , whose contempt for reporters and whose techniques for frustrating their pursuit of the news make the old war between Nixon and the press seem naive and innocent . Perhaps Nixon will never be President . If not , it probably will be because of the Greeley Syndrome ? after Horace Greeley 's defeat for the Presidency in 1872 , one observer noted , " He called out a larger proportion of those who intended to vote against him than any candidate had ever before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unify California Democrats , but Nixon performed that feat in 1962 . After he campaigned in Pennsylvania in 1966 , the Democratic gubernatorial candidate commented , " This has helped me by 15,000 to 50,000 votes . " Most party-oriented of all the GOP hopefuls , Nixon has honestly inherited the late Senator Taft 's proud title of " Mr. Republican . " But it still is a Democratic country . Sitting in a Los Angeles hotel room , sipping coffee with three reporters in 1966 , Richard Nixon was asked , " What keeps you going ? " " Sometimes I wonder myself , " he said . " I started in this thing when I was 32 . You know me , I like people , but I 'm not an extrovert type . I am one who believes that you pass this way only once , and when the great decisions are made , you want to be in on them . It 's the Theodore Roosevelt thing ? the man in the arena , facing the challenge . " Nixon then sketched without exaggeration the life he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary , privilege and position , long vacations at fashionable resorts . " I 'd be bored to death , " he said . " I 'd be dead mentally in two years and probably dead physically in four . No , that is not for me . " Haunted though he is by the dream of the Presidency , the answer to what makes Nixon tick may really be a simpler one than anyone suspects . " The thing I enjoy " he said , " is the battle itself . "
