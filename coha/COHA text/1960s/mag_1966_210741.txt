For nearly a year , while Lyndon Johnson , Dean Rusk and Robert McNamara agonized over whether to step up the U.S. air raids on North Viet Nam , one presidential adviser consistently argued that the bombing of the petroleum depots around Hanoi and Haiphong was vital to the U.S. war effort . Now that the President has accepted that approach-also urged on him by the Joint Chiefs of Staff-the insistent adviser 's influence in the Ad ministration 's inner circle has increased considerably . The man : Walt Whitman Rostow , 49 , the garrulous , determined special assistant who three months ago inherited part of McGeorge Bundy 's job at the White House . <P> Lyndon Johnson , who likes his staffmen to keep their mouths shut and stay out of sight unless he personally deputizes them to speak and be seen in public , has shown his trust by ungagging Rostow and allowing him to surface publicly from his office in the White House basement . He sent Rostow to Los Angeles last week to participate in the supersensitive briefings on Viet Nam before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Face the Nation to wrestle with newsmen 's questions about the stepped-up bombing . Rostow joined Johnson and others for strategy talks at the Texas ranch . <P> More than Pollyanna . Rostow is distrusted by many for his hawkish attitudes and derided even within the Administration as an expounder of outspoken and endless optimism to a President who craves good news . Rostow does see through rather rosy lenses . He has said : " We 're closer to an era of real global peace than any time since 1914 . " On Face the Nation , he said bluntly of the Communist campaign in South Viet Nam : " They have been tactically defeated . " Having once referred to John Kennedy 's success in the 1962 Cuban missile crisis as " the Gettysburg of global civil conflict , " he recently updated the analogy by comparing the Viet Nam war to the Civil War 's Wilderness Campaign , a series of bloody battles from which the war-weary Confederate Army never recovered . <P> Still , more and more people are beginning to feel that things are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the basement reflects far more than Pollyannish optimism . Soon after Johnson took office , Rostow ( then a top State Department policy planner ) said flatly : " Viet Nam is Johnson 's Cuba ; it will make him or break him . " As one of the Administration 's toughest-talking hawks , he began urging heavy commitments of ground troops early in Kennedy 's tenure-nearly four years before Johnson actually made the decision in 1965 . In a town where appraisals of a situation 's dangers often spell delay , Rostow looks for answers to national questions through action based on the best available information , tries to cut through the heavy bureaucracy .
