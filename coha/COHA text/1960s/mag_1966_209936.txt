The helicopter bearing Hubert Humphrey eased deliberately through the chill twilight so as not to reach the White House lawn ahead of the TV cameras . It was the only leisurely part of his homecoming . The Vice President stepped from the chopper into Lyndon Johnson 's capacious abrazo , then plunged into a hectic round of briefings and appearances . Having stumped nine Far Eastern countries to solicit support for the Johnson Administration 's Viet Nam policy , his task last week was to convert the critics back home . <P> <P> After giving the President an immediate " quick porthole look " of his impressions , Humphrey was back at 8 a.m. next day to address members of Congress . His listeners found Humphrey unwontedly militant , particularly since his mission had been to emphasize that the U.S. is as deeply committed to the struggle for a better life in Asia as it is to the defeat of Red aggression . <P> Talking " Win . " In each of the " two wars , " said Humphrey , " we have a right to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnamese Premier Nguyen Cao Ky , he declared : " The National Liberation Front is neither national nor liberating , but it is a front . Communism is one thing as a theory for discussion in this country , but it is quite another in those small countries of Asia where its teeth are bared and its appetite consuming . Its creed is terror , murder , assassination . " To make sure that the Administration 's congressional critics got the point , Humphrey wondered aloud why some of them " always suggest what we might give up " in order to bring about negotiations . " Why not ask what Hanoi might give up ? " <P> One listener who agreed went away saying : " He was talking ' Win . ' He was much tougher than McNamara ever was before our committee , and tougher than Rusk . " Senator Wayne Morse , who likes weak talk , grumped : " I think he has lost all his persuasiveness among people who think . I never expected my Vice President to make this plea for war . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lawmakers , Humphrey assured them : " We have now reached the stage where our military forces can sustain a planned , methodical forward movement . " Though he was doubtful about the efficacy of B-52 raids on South Viet Nam when he left for the Far East , the Vice President added , he is now convinced they are useful . <P> Chums with Peking . Humphrey 's handling of his trip and the subsequent briefings won him more attention than have come his way since his nomination in 1964 . He also had his troubles . From Pakistan , where he had met the coolest reception of his tour , came a chorus of protest over a story distributed by the United States Information Service after he had left . It quoted him as saying that Pakistan was " fully aware of the threat of Communist China , " whereas the regime is as eager as ever to stay chums with Peking . Humphrey subsequently denied making the statement . In India , <P> Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was more polite , but still found it necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed her government 's nonaligned foreign policy .
