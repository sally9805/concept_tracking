Within the black granite walls of the Stockholms Enskilda Bank is a coat of arms that bears a sober motto , borrowed from Aeschylus : Esse non Videri - to be , not to seem . In line with this injunction , the family that runs the bank has become the most powerful and wealthiest in Sweden , without seeming to be the fiscal princes they are . <P> The Wallenbergs either control outright-or persuasively advise-no fewer than 50 Swedish companies , or more than half of Sweden 's industry . Directly under Wallenberg management are most of Sweden 's international companies , including plane-and automaking SAAB , the $275 million telephone equipment manufacturer L. M. Ericsson , the $500 million ballbearing producer SKF , and Stora Kopparberg , a diversified mining and mineral complex ( TIME , March 15 ) . The family also guides Stockholm 's largest department store and the company that runs the city 's three most luxurious restaurants . In no other industrialized nation in the world does one family exert such enormous economic power . <P> Sweden for Swedes . The Wallenberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. and Scotland as a young naval lieutenant , became fascinated by banking and founded Stockholm 's first commercial bank in 1856 . His Enskilda Bank became the chief funnel through which foreign capital entered Sweden , and Andr and the succeeding Wallenbergs directed the flow of foreign funds to finance Swedish industrialization . <P> The Wallenberg empire is run today by the most successful brother act in <P> European finance . Jacob , 70 , a reticent bachelor , stays in Stockholm to mind the home office , while robust and gregarious Marcus , 63 , jets around the world to check on Wallenberg projects and find new investment opportunities . Though they hold the chairmanship of 27 companies , the brothers prefer to own no more than 5% or 10% of any company . They really do not need more , for most Swedish companies are only too ready to submit to Wallenberg management ; they know that it means expert guidance and money for expansion . Says Marcus coolly : " It so happens that the companies we have been concerned with have been successful . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; two months ago , they set up a holding company called Incentive to keep small , family-held Swedish firms from being bought up by foreign bidders . <P> Yachts &; Tennis . Despite their great wealth , both brothers live unostentatiously . Jacob drives himself to his office in a middle-class Opel ; Marcus has a Buick and usually does the driving-but he has a chauffeur to answer the car 's radiotelephone . An expert yachtsman , Jacob skippered his 59.4-ft. yawl Refanut to victory in last year 's 350-mile Baltic race . Marcus was Sweden 's tennis champion in the 1920s and is still an expert player ; he also excels at pingpong . <P> Neither brother ever misses an opportunity to downplay himself . Says Jacob , who is chairman of 13 companies : " The only reason I 'm on so many boards is that I 've been around so long . " Marcus is even more self-effacing : " I am nothing , " he says , " but a hyphen between generations . " In one sense , he is right . His son Marc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Enskilda Bank , and is being groomed to be the next head of the clan .
