( See Cover ) <P> The Clays of Louisville are an old Kentucky family . Not rich , maybe , like the folks who play pool in the Pendennis Club and chew mint leaves on the veranda at Churchill Downs . But the Clays have been there for six generations-ever since their ancestors worked as slaves on the plantation of Cassius Marcellus Clay , who was Lincoln 's Minister to Russia . They like the name , and they like Louisville , and they have a red brick house with five rooms , all of them on one floor . It 's got wall-to-wall carpeting in every room and a picture painted right on the white plaster wall in the living room . <P> Old Cash Clay did that mural himself . Cassius Marcellus Clay Sr. is a sign painter . Up there where it says KING KARL 'S THREE ROOMS OF NEW FURNITURE on Market Street-he did that , just as he painted A. B. HARRIS , M.D. , DELIVERIES &; FEMALE DISORDERS on Dumesnil Street , Louisville . His son , Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm gon na drive down Walnut Street in a Caddy on Derby Day . " he says , " and all the people will point and say , ' There goes Cassius Clay . ' Pretty girls will be there , and I 'll smell the flowers and feel the nice warm night air . Oh , I 'm cool then , man . I 'm cool . The girls are looking at me , and I 'm looking away . <P> I 'm wanting to know them worse than they want to know me-only they do n't know it . " By Derby Day next year , Cassius figures , he will be the heavyweight boxing champion of the world . <P> " I 'm the Greatest . " Some people think Cassius Clay talks too much .

" I 'm the greatest . I 'm the double greatest . I am clean and sparkling . I will be a clean and sparkling champion . " <P> Cassius Clay is Hercules , struggling through the twelve labors . He is Jason , chasing the Golden Fleece . He is Galahad , Cyrano , D'Artagnan . When he scowls , strong men shudder , and when he smiles , women swoon . The mysteries of the universe are his Tinker Toys . He rattles the thunder and looses the lightning . " I was marked , " he says . " I had a big head , and I looked like Joe Louis in my cradle . People said so . One day I threw my first punch and hit my mother right in the teeth and knocked one out . If you do n't believe me , ask her . "
