txt Contenders are lining up for the greatest English Channel race of all . Groups wishing to finance and manage the channel tunnel between Dover and Calais have until April 15 to tender their proposals to the British and French Governments . So far three British groups  --  two of them with American connections ? two French , and one Japanese have shown interest . Work on the tunnel is expected to begin next year with 1974 as the target date for completion . British travel agents are smiling . They 're optimistic aboutthe coming travel season despite the economic cold water officially sprinkled on overseas travel . To plug up the sterling leak , the government now is limiting each traveler to an annual foreign-exchange allowance of ? 50 ( $140 ) ? plus 215 to jingle in his pocket . But so far the restraint is n't keeping Britons at home . Although some still may be awaiting details of the April budget before fixing summer vacation plans , bookings are already extra heavy to such sterling-area resorts as Malta , Cyprus , and Bermuda . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ? 225 million Britons spend each year on foreign holidays . But if the government succeeds , it probably will be higher taxes , rather than the lid on foreign-currency allowances , which make the difference . Anyway , travel agents are n't worrying . Next week Britain 's Trades Union Congress ( TUC ) takes on a major internal selling job . On March 2 it will try to persuade leaders of 172 unions to support the TUC 's own doit-itself proposal for policing union demands for wage increases . The TUC strongly opposes permanent government control of wage levels . It wants to do its own supervising and appraising of union wage demands . But some of the strongest unions still insist on having the freedom to make whatever demands they want . Wages are a delicate subject just now . Britain 's total pay freeze stuck fast from July to January . It now has thawed slightly into a six-month stretch of " severe restraint " extending until August . After that the government would like to arm itself with reserve powers . It wants to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency arise . The government has announced that its own spending will rise 8.5 percent in the next 12 months .

Older married women in Britain may not think of themselves as a potential labor pool . But the Department of Economic Affairs ( DEA ) is already looking their way . England may have heavy unemployment today . But a survey by the DEA forecasts that by 1970 British industry will be hunting around for more workers . Married females are the reserve most likely to be tapped . Before World War II only 1 in 10 married British women worked . Now the number has jumped to 1 in 3 . Of 25.25 million Britons employed last year , more than 8.75 million were women . And more than half of these were married . In the future , the DEA reports , married women will be needed to close labor gaps in public transport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more married women want to work ? if they can do so without disrupting family life . Potentially a married woman with growing children has a longer spell of unbroken employment ahead of her than that most mercurial of all laborers  --  the single girl who just might marry . How and whY After being " ins " for 13 years , the Conservative Party is having to learn the competitive skills of being " outs . " And in the Tory hierarchy Anthony Barber is a coming man . He is urbane but combative . His appointment to a new job in Edward Heath 's shadow cabinet is part of the general gingering up of the Tory attack . Mr. Barber will have special responsibility for coordinating the work of the Conservatives witbin the House of Commons . He will be a kind of chief of staff  --  coordinating MPs and party policy , putting backbench talent to work and stiffening the fight against the Labor government .
