When changes are made in the hierarchy of the Soviet Union , they often prove to be a case of strapping the same old collars onto fresh dogs . Last week the Kremlin named two men to top posts in the Soviet hierarchy , one to wield the sword and the other the pen . Though the shifts indicated no policy changes , they did produce new names and faces that the West will be hearing and seeing for some time . <P> &gt;Andrei Antonovich Grechko , 63 , Russia 's First Deputy Defense Minister , was promoted to Defense Minister to replace Rodion Malinovsky , who died last month of cancer . His appointment abruptly ended speculation that the Kremlin , over army objections , was about to turn the defense ministry over to a civilian . Like Malinovsky , Grechko is a hardbitten , hard-drinking professional soldier who worked his way up through the ranks to become a marshal in the Red army . As Malinovsky 's stand-in for the past ten years , he became proficient in the art of rocket rattling , in 1963 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no mat ter where they are . " For the past seven years , Grechko has doubled as supreme commander of the Warsaw Pact ar mies , a post that the Kremlin last week gave to another Russian general . Grechko is something of a political hero as well : among the eight rows of medals on his chest is East Germany 's Gold Order of Merit , which he won for suppressing the workers ' uprising in 1953 . <P> &gt;Sergei Georgievich Lapin , 55 , a protege of Party Chairman Leonid Brezhnev , was promoted to director of Tass , Russia 's news agency and principal propaganda organ . Tass not only serves Russian newspapers internally but has a worldwide network of 200 men in 93 countries , including four in Washington , is often accused of using them for other purposes than news gathering . A onetime Tassman ( 1945-55 ) who later switched to diplomacy and became Deputy Foreign Minister , Lapin has spent the past two years as ambassador to Red China , but has been absent from his post for months because of Chinese demonstrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brezhnev protege whose future is uncertain . With unjournalistic vagueness , Tass reported only that Goryunov has been assigned to " other work . "
