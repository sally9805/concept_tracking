The most powerful Communist in Czechoslovakia was suddenly besieged in downtown Prague last week by a pack of long-haired flower children . Carrying assorted objects that ranged from badminton rackets to open umbrellas , wearing bright colors and strung with beads , Prague 's hippies thrust bunches of carnations and tulips into Party Boss Alexander Dubcek 's hands during a May Day parade singularly devoid of the polemics heard elsewhere in the Communist world . Dubcek smiled with pleasure at the unusual sign of support for his reformist regime , signed autographs and accepted sandwiches and cake offered him from the crowd . But not all was flowers and cake for Dubcek last week , and hippies were not the only ones besieging him . <P> On the one hand , the Soviet Union was pressuring him to slow down his reforms ; Pravda spoke ominously of " subversive activities , antipopular forces , anti-Communist hysteria and anarchy " in Czechoslovakia . To soothe the Russians , Dubcek , accompanied by Premier Oldrich Cernik , flew to Moscow for talks with Soviet Party Boss Leonid Brezhnev . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Czechoslovakia were demanding nothing less than full democracy . <P> " Rabbits Long Enough . " In Prague 's Old Town Square , students organized the most anti-Communist rally yet of the four-month-old " socialist renaissance . " Assembling at the statue of the 15th century reformist theologian Jan Hus , thousands of people heard speakers call upon Dubcek to permit opposition political parties and to rid the government of old-line party men who still hold office . " We have been rabbits long enough ! " shouted Engineering Student Josef Vavelda . " We hear we should be grateful to the Communist Party , " said another speaker . " Yes , we are very grateful for inadequate housing , grateful for bad worker morale , grateful for legal insecurity . " <P> The Russians are worried about the increasingly anti-Soviet tone of Dubcek 's liberalization . Czechoslovak news papers , for example , openly accused the Russian secret police of engineering the forced confessions and show trials of the 1950s . In fact , the onetime state prosecutor at those trials , Karol Bacilek , charged last week that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conduct the purge was none other than Anastas Mikoyan , later the Soviet President . <P> The Russians also fear that Dubcek will turn to the West for the economic aid that he badly needs . Thus a prime topic of conversation during Dubcek 's visit to Moscow was an unusual Soviet offer of $300 million or more worth of credit in hard currency . Dubcek will no doubt gladly take the money , but he is also eager to make sure that the Russians do not revert from the carrot to the stick and cut off the oil and raw-material shipments upon which his country depends . As a hedge against any loss of Soviet oil , for example , he is reportedly negotiating with Iran for millions of tons of oil . <P>
