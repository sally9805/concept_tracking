" Consumer confidence has begun to reappear , " beamed Bernard Gimbel , berry-eyed boss of Manhattan 's Gimbel Bros . Over at Macy 's , Chairman Jack I. Straus was quick to match the Gimbel grin . Said he : " Our Christmas sales this year will come close to or break the season 's record . " From Burdine 's in Miami to the Bon Marche in Seattle , U.S. retailers last week reported the same phenomenon : with " big ticket " items such as TV sets leading the way , department stores sales spurted 6% above last year 's levels during Thanksgiving week , and many stores have done even better since then . <P> No one really knew just why the U.S. consumer has suddenly relaxed the stern budget watching that has been so severe a drag on the nation 's economic recovery ( TIME , July 21 et seq . ) . Scorning such psychological explanations as Christmas spirit or a diminishing fear of war , the economists could only note that more jobs , longer work weeks , and increased dividends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income by $4 billion in October to a record annual rate of $425 billion . Furthermore , though the cost of living has risen less than 1% , the average weekly take-home pay of a factory hand with two children is up almost 5% over a year ago . <P> Whatever the explanation , the omens seemed so favorable to Commerce Secretary Luther Hodges , himself an oldtime retailer , that he predicted overall Christmas retail sales would run 4% to 5% above last year 's high levels . To justify his renewed confidence in the consumer , Hodges could point to the boom in auto sales , which in mid-November reached a record 23.070 cars a day . The rejoicing in Detroit was not shared equally by all automakers : though General Motors had boosted its mid-November share of the auto market to 54% and Ford held a strong 28% . Chrysler 's share had dipped to 10.6% ( from 12.5% a year ago ) and American Motors ' from 6.4% to 5.8% . But taken as a whole , the automakers had revised their 1961 sales predictions from 5,700.000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were even suggesting that sales in the last three months of this year might well top the alltime fourth-quarter record of 1,700,780 cars set in 1955.
