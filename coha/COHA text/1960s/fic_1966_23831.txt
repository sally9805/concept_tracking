The Last Gentleman Two Excerpts from the Forthcoming Novel by Walker Percy Introduction : Will Barrett , the protagonist of this novel , is a carious young man beset by curious symptoms . He suffers a dislocation of his time sense which is manifested by attacks of amnesia and d  --  j ? vus . A transplanted Southerner living in New York , he periodically lapses into fugue states and is apt to come to himself on old battlefields in Virginia , disoriented but haunted by a sense of history . His moods are paradoxical : he becomes depressed and anxious in psychologically favorable situations and exhilarated in times of catastrophe . At present he is employed as a humidification engineer at Macy 's where he presides over a computer three floors below street level . His early life was not unusual , but while attending Princeton University he became depressed and moved to New York where he took up residence at the YMCA and submitted himself to intensive psychoanalysis and group therapy . Copyright 0 1966 , by Walker Percy The action of the novel begins with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he sets up a telescope and observes quite by accident the rendezvous of two women half a mile away . Barrett 's " symptoms " are presented equivocally . They can be construed according to traditional psychology as such , as symptoms , that is , as evidences of a personality disorder and maladaptation of organism to environment . Or his symptoms can be understood as more or less appropriate reactions to a new order of things , an as yet unnamed era which may have begun without his even being aware of it . The reader is free to have him sick or well , as he chooses . Barrett 's suspicion , for example , that the world catastrophe which everyone fears might happen has in fact already happened  --  this RWSpicion can be read , if one prefers , as a delusion . ? w . P. 55 The Hurricane It was shortly after the weekend at Bear Mountain that he lapsed into a fugue state which was worse than the last . But now he had developed an even more alarming symptom . He began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt good and good when they felt bad . Take an ordinary day in New York . The sun is shining , people live well , go about satisfying their needs and achieving goals , work at creative jobs , attend cultural attractions , participate in interesting groups . This is , by every calculation , as it should he . Yet it was on just such a day as this , an ordinary Wednesday or Thursday , that he felt the deepest foreboding . And when his doctor , seeking to reassure him , suggested that in these perilous times a man might well be entitled to such a feeling , that only the insensitive did not . etc. , it made him feel worse than ever . The analyst had got it all wrong . It was not he prospect of the Last Day which depressed him but rather the prospect of living through an ordinary Wednesday morning . Though science taught that good environments were better than had environments , it appeared to him that the opposite was the case . Take hurricanes , for example , certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his impression that not just he but other people too felt better in hurricanes  --  though it must be admitted that he had studied only four people and one hurricane , evidence hardly adequate to support a scientific hypothesis . One real robin does suggest a spring , however . The summer before he had got caught in hurricane Donna . A girl named Midge Auchincloss , none other in fact than the daughter of his father 's old friend , had invited him to drive her up to a jazz festival in Newport . During the same weekend a small hurricane was beating up along the coast but giving every sign of careening oft into the North Atlantic . Nobody took much notice of it . Friday afternoon nothing was very different . The old Northeast smelled the same , the sky was hazed over , and things were of not much account . The engineer and his friend Midge behaved toward each other in their customary fashion . They did not have much to say , not as a consequence of a breakdown in communications such as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact not much to say . Though they liked each other well enough , there was nothing to do , it seemed , but press against each other whenever they were alone . Coming home to Midge 's apartment late atnight , they would step over the sleeping Irishman , stand in the elevator and press against each other for a good half hour , each gazing abstractedly and dry-eyed over the other 's shoulder . But a knoll of high pressure reared up in front of Donna and she backed off to the west . On the way home from . Newport , the Auchinclosses ' Continental ran into the hurricane in Connecticut . Searching for Bridgeport and blinded by the rain which hit the windshield like a stream from a firehose , the engineer took a wrong exit off the turnpike and entered upon a maze of narrow high-crowned blacktop ? , such as crisscross Connecticut , and got lost . Within a few minutes the gale winds reached near-hurricane strength and there was nothing to do but stop the car . Feeling moderately exhilarated by the uproar outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their cocoon of heavy-gauge metal and safety glass , they fell upon one another fully clothed and locked in a death grip . Strange Yankee bushes , perhaps alder and dog-bane , thrashed against the windows . Hearing a wailing sound , they sat up and had the shock of their lives . There , standing in the full glare of the headlights or rather leaning against the force of the hurricane , was a child hardly more than a babe . For a long moment there was nothing to do but gaze at him , so wondrous a sight it was , a cherub striding the blast , its cheeks puffed out by the four winds . Then he was blown away . The engineer went after him , backing up on all fours , butt to wind like a range pony , reached the ditch and found him . Now with the babe lying as cold as lard between them and not even shivering , the engineer started the Continental and crept along . feeling the margin of the road under his tire like a thread under the fingertip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a restaurant left over from the days before the turnpikes . For two hours they sat in a booth and cared for the child , fed him Campbell 's chicken-and-rice soup and spoke to him . He was not hurt but he was round-eyed and bemused and had nothing to say . It became a matter of figuring out what to do with him . The phone was dead and there was no policeman or anyone at all except the counterman who brought a candle and joined them . The wind Walker Percy 's first novel , " The Moviegoer , " won the National Book Award in 196f . Born in Alabama , Mr. Percy went to high school in Mississippi , to college at the University of North Carolina , and received an M.D. from Columbia University in 1941 . He now lives in Covington , Louisiana . His new novel , " The Last Gentleman , " from which these excerpts are taken , will he published by Farrar , Straus &; Giroux in June . 56 THE LAST GENTLEMAN shrieked and the streetcar swayed and thrummed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window broke . They helped the counterman board it up with Coca-Cola crates . Midge and the counterman , he noticed , were very happy . The hurricane blew away the sad , noxious particles which befoul the sorrowful old eastern sky and Midge no longer felt obliged to keep her face stiff . They were able to talk . It was best of all when the hurricane 's eye came with its so-called ominous stillness . It was not ominous . Everything was yellow and still and charged up with value . The table was worth $200 . The unexpected euphoria went to the counterman 's head and he bored them with long stories about his experiences as a busboy in a camp for adults ( the engineer had never heard of such a thing ) somewhere in the Catskills . Even the problem of the lost child turned into a pleasure instead of a chore , so purgative was the action of the hurricane . " Where in the world do you come from ? " Midge asked him . The child did not answer and the counterman did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clue . " What a curious looking ring , " she said , taking the child 's hand . " That 's not a ring , that 's a chicken band , " said the counterman . " Is there a chicken farm near here ? " the engineer asked him . There was , and it was the right place . When they delivered the babe an hour later , wonder of wonders , he had not even been missed . Ten children were underfoot and Dad and Mom were still out in the chicken houses , and sister , a twelveyear-old who was also round-eyed and silent , received the prodigal as if it were nothing out of the way . This was the best of all , of course , returning the child before it was missed , him not merely delivered from danger but the danger itself canceled , like Mr. Magoo going his way through the perilous world , stepping off the Empire State Building onto a girder and never seeing the abyss . Breakfast in the diner and back to the turnpike and on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the pearly light of morning , another beautiful day and augh there it was again : the Bronx all solid and sullen from being the same today as yesterday , full of itself with lumpish Yankee fullness , the bricks coinciding with themselves and braced against all comers . Gravity in -- creased , Down into the booming violet air of Park Avenue they crept , under the selfsame canopy and into the selfsame lobby and over the sleeping Irishman and into the elevator where they strove against each other like wrestlers , each refusing to yield an inch . Final Visit He dressed and paid his last visit to Dr. Gamow. his psychoanalyst . For the thousandth time he took his seat in a reclining chair which had been purposely set in a position which was neither up nor down , neither quite faced the doctor nor faced away . Dr. Gamow , who had had it specially designed and constructed , called it his " ambiguous " chair . He learned a great deal about a patient from the way he sat in the chair . Some would walk in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor across his desk like a client consulting a lawyer . Others would stretch out and swivel away to face the corner in conventional analytic style . It was characteristic of the engineer that he sat in the ambiguous chair ambiguously : leaving it just as it was , neither up nor down , neither quite facing Dr. Gamow nor facing away . For the thousandth time Dr. Gamow looked at his patient  --  who sat as usual , alert and pleasant  --  and felt a small spasm of irritation . It was this amiability , he decided , which got on his nerves . There was a slyness about it and an opacity which put one off . It had not always been so between them . For the first year the analyst had been charmed  --  never had he had a more responsive patient . Never had his own theories found a readier confirmation than in the free ( they seemed to be free ) associations and the copious dreams which this one spread out at his feet like so many trophies . The next year or so left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little too good to be true . At last the suspicion awoke that he , the doctor , was being entertained , royally it is true and getting paid for the privilege besides , but entertained nevertheless . Trophies they were sure enough , these dazzling wares offered every day , trophies to put him off the scent while the patient got clean away . Sourer still was the second suspicion that even the patient 's dreams and recollections , which bore out the doctor 's theories , confirmed hypotheses right and left , were somehow or other a performance too , the most exquisite of courtesies , as if the apple had fallen to the ground to please Sir Isaac Newton . Charged accordingly , the patient of course made an equally charming confession , exhibited heroic sweats and contortions to overcome his bad habits , offered crabbed and meager dreams , and so made another trophy of his disgrace . The last year of the analysis the doctor had grown positively disgruntled . This one was a Southern belle . he decided , a good dancing part-net. , light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know how not to give away nothing . For four years they had danced , the two of them , the strangest dance in history , each attuned to the other and awaiting his pleasure , and so off they went crabwise and nowhere at all . The doctor did n't like his patient much , to tell the truth . They were not good friends . Although they had spent a thousand hours together in the most intimate converse , they were no more than acquaintances . Less than acquaintances . A laborer digging in a ditch would know more about his partner in a week than the doctor had learned about this patient in a year . Yet outwardly they were friendly enough . The engineer , on the other hand had a high opinion of his analyst and especially liked hearing him speak . Though Dr. Gamow was a native of Jackson Heights , his speech was exotic . He had a dark front tooth , turned on its axis , and he puckered his lips and pronounced his rs like toe . The engineer liked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a musical clinical Viennese sound . Unlike most Americans , who speak as if they were sipping gruel , he chose his words like bonbons , so that his patients , whose lives were a poor meager business , received the pleasantest sense of the richness and delectability of such everyday things as words . Unlike some analysts , he did not use big words or technical words ; but the small ordinary words he did use were invested with a peculiar luster. " 1 think you are pretty unhappy after all , " he might say , pronouncing prFtty as it is spelled . His patient would nod gratefully . Even unhappiness is not so bad when it can be uttered so well . And in truth it did seem to the engineer , who was quick to sniff out theories and such , that people would feel better if they could lay hold of ordinary words . At five o'clock , the engineer 's hour , the office smelled of the accumulated misery of the day , an ozone of malcontent which stung the eyes like a Lionel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a Bahama theme , with a fiber rug and prints of hummingbirds and Negresses walking with baskets on their heads , but the rug had hardened and curled up at the corners like old skin . Balls of fluff drifted under the rattan table . " I  --  suggest  --  that if it is all right with you ? " began Dr. Gamow , jotting a note on a smooth yellow pad with a gold pencil ( this is all you really need to set your life in order , the patient was thinking , a good pad and pencil ) , " ? we 'll change Monday from five to five-thirty . How is that for you , bad , eh ? " " No , it 's not bad at all . " by Walker Percy 59 Dr. Gamow pricked up his ears . " Did you say mad ? " " No , I believe I said bad : it 's not bad at all . " " It seemed to me that at first you said mad . " " It 's possible , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Dr. Gamow shyly , " who is mad at who . " Whenever he caught the engineer in a slip , he had a way of slewing his eyes around as shyly as a young girl . " Now what might it be that you are mad about ? " " I 'm not really . " " I detected a little more ' in than b . I think maybe you are a little mad at me . " " I do n't ? " began the engineer , casting back in his mind to the events of the last session , but as usual he could remember nothing . " You may well be right , but I do n't recall anything in particular . " " Maybe you think I 'm a little mad at you . " " I honestly do n't know , " said the patient , pretending to rack his brain but in fact savoring the other 's words . Maybe , for example , was minted deliberately as a bright new common coin mebbe in conscious preference to perhaps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head to one side and sighted down into the kneehole of his desk . He might have been examining a bank of instruments . His nostril curved up exposing the septum of his nose and imparting to him a feral winged look which served to bear out his reputation of clinical skill . His double-breasted suit had wide lapels and , sitting as he did , hunched over and thick through the chest , his lapels bowed out like a cuirass , his lips pursed about the interesting reed of a tooth , it was easy to believe that he served his patients best as artificer and shaper , receiving the raw stuff of their misery and handing it back in a public and acceptable form . " It does sound to me as if you 've had a prkty bad time . Tel me about it . " And the unspeakable could be spoken of . He told Dr. Gamow he had reached a decision . It seemed plain to him that he had exhausted the resources of analysis  --  not that he had not benefited enormously  --  and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the analyst , making a little joke of it , heh heh . After spending almost five years as an object of technique , however valuable , he thought maybe he 'd go over to the other side , become one of them , the scientists . He might even have an idea or two about the " failure of communication " and the " loss of identity " in the modern world ( at it again , throwing roses in the path , knowing these were favorite subjects of Dr. Gamow ) . Mebbe he should strike out on his own . 60 THE LAST GENTLEMAN And , said he , he had run out of money . " I see that after all you are a little mad at me , " said Dr. Gamow . " How 's that , " said the engineer , appearing to look caught out . " Perhaps it might be worthwhile to look into whatever it is you are mad about . " " All right , " said the engineer , who would as soon do one thing as another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his pad , " We were talking about your theory of environments . I believe you said that even under ideal conditions you felt somewhat  --  hollow was the word I think you used . " " Yes , " said the patient , who was genuinely surprised . He had forgotten that he had spoken of his new theory . " I wondered out loud at the time what you meant by hollow  --  whether it referred to your body or perhaps an organ , and it seemed to me you were offended by the suggestion . " " Yes . " He remembered now that he had been offended . He had known at the time that Dr. Gamow had thought he meant that he had felt actually hollowed out , brain or spleen emptied of its substance . It had offended him that Dr. Gamow had suggested that he might be crazy . " I then made the suggestion that mebbe that was your way of getting rid of people , literally hollowing them out , ' so to speak . A pretty thoroughgoing method of execution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you may recall , you made a little slip at the end of the hour . You said you had to leave early  --  you had jumped up , you may recall  --  saying that you had to attend a meeting at the store , but you said ' beating ' . " " Yes . " " I could n't help but wonder who the beating was intended for . Was it you who got the beating from me yesterday ? Or am I getting a beating from you today ? " " You could be right , " said the engineer , trying to straighten the ambiguous chair and face the doctor . He meant to signify that he wished to say something that should be listened to and not gotten at . " Nevertheless I have decided on a course of action and I think I 'd better see it through . " For some reason he laughed heartily . " Oh me , " he said with a sigh . " Hnhnhn , " said Dr. Gamow . It was an ancient and familial sound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as hardly to be a sound at all . The engineer leaned back and looked at the print of hummingbirds . They symbolized ideas , Dr. Gamow had explained jokingly , happy ideas which he hoped would fly into the heads of his patients . One bird 's gorget did not quite fit ; the print had been jogged in the making and the gorget had slipped and stuck out like a bib . For years the patient had gazed at this little patch of red , making a slight mental effort each time to put it back in place . " I notice now that you use the phrase ' run out ' have run out of money ' , " said Dr. Gamow . Lining up his feet again , he sighted along his knee like an astronaut . " The idea suggests itself that you literally ran out of your own money ? " " Figuratively , " murmured the engineer . " Leaving it behind ? I could not help but notice you seem to have acquired what seems to be a very expensive possession . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The handsome leather case . " Dr. Gamow nodded toward the reception room . " Camera ? Microscope ? " " Telescope , " he said . He had forgotten his recent purchase ! He was , moreover , obscurely scandalized that the doctor should take account of something out in the waiting room . " A telescope , " mused the analyst , sighting into the farthest depths of the desk . " Do you intend to become a seer ? " " A seer ? " " A see-er . After all a seer is a see-er , one who can see . Could it be that you believe that there is some ultimate hidden truth and that you have the magical means for obtaining it ? " " Ha ha , there might be something in that . A see-er . Yes . " " So now it seems you have spent your money on an instrument which will enable you to see the truth once and for all ? " The engineer shrugged affably . " It would be pretty nice if we could find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you remember the last time you left you stood up and said : ' Look here now , this analysis is all very well but how about telling me the truth just between ourselves , off the record , that is , what am I really supposed to do . ' Do you remember that ? " " Yes . " " Arid do you still think that I am spoofing you ? " Dr. Gamow , who liked to be all things to all men , had somewhere got the notion that in the South you said " spoofing " a great deal . The engineer nodded . " You also recall that this great thirst for the answer , ' the key which will unlock everything , always overtakes you just before the onset of one of your fugue states ? " " Not always . " " Always in the past . " " Not this time . " " How much did it cost you ? " " What ? " " The telescope . " " Nineteen hundred dollars . " " Nineteen hundred dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with the sum of fifty-eight dollars and thirty cents , " said the engineer . " According to my calculations I owe you for eight sessions this month including this one . " And arising from the ambiguous chair , he placed two twenties and a ten on the desk . " Now I owe you one fifty . I 'll pay you at the end of the month . " Dr. Gamow gazed at the money . " May I review for you one or two facts . Number one , you have had previous fugue states . Number two , you give every indication of having another . You always quit the analysis and you always buy something expensive before taking off . The last time it was a Corvette . You still have a defective ego structure , number three . Number four , you develop ideas of reference . This time it is hollow men , noxious particles , and ultimate truths . " It always seemed strange to hear Dr. Gamow speak of him clinically . Once when the analyst was called away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stolen a glance at the file which lay open on the blotter . " . . . a well-developed and nourished young white male , " he read , " with a pleasing demeanor , dressed in an unusual raglan jacket . " ( This description must have been written at the time he had fallen in with the Ohioans , become one himself , and bought a raglan jacket so that he could move his shoulders around freely . ) " When asked why he had chosen this particular article of apparel , he replied that ' it made me feel free ' . " Seeing himself set down so , in a clinical quotation , gave him a peculiar turn . His scalp bristled . But now he nodded equably and , leaning back , gazed at the dusty little hummingbird . " Very well , " said Dr. Gamow when he did not answer . " You have made your decision . The question is what is to be done next . " " Yes sir . " " May I make a suggestion ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new group in therapy . It will be limited to ten persons . It is a very good group and my feeling is that you could profit by the experience . They are people like yourself who are having difficulty relating to other people by Walker Percy 61 in a meaningful way . Like yourself they find themselves in some phase or other of an identity crisis . There is , let me see  --  a novelist who is blocked , an engineer like yourself who works with digital computers and who feels somewhat depersonalized . There is an actress you will recognize instantly , who has suddenly begun forgetting her lines . There is a housewife with a little more anxiety than she can handle , psychiatrically oriented but also success oriented . There is an extremely sensitive Negro who is not success oriented  --  a true identity problem there . And four social workers from White Plains . It 's a lot better than the last group you were in  --  these are some very high-flying folks and I do n't think you 'll be able to snow them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said the engineer to himself ; these are just the kind of folks I snow best . " We shall met here three times a week . The fee is nominal , five dollars . " " I certainly do appreciate it , " said the engineer earnestly . " It does indeed sound like an interesting group , but for the present my salary will not permit it . Perhaps when my Soil Bank check comes through ? " " From the old plantation ? " asked Dr. Gamow . " Yes . But I assure you I feel quite well . " " Euphoric in fact , " said Dr. Gamow ironically . The engineer grinned . " Mebbe I could join y'all later . " " This is not a catfish fry , " said the analyst testily . At the end of the hour they arose and shook hands pleasantly . The patient took a last look at the dusty hummingbird that had been buzzing away at the same trumpet vine for five years . The little bird seemed dejected . The bird , the print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one leaves behind . It was time to get up and go . He was certain that he would never see any of them again . Before leaving , he obtained from Dr. Gamow a prescription for the little blue spansules which he saved for his worst times . They did not restore his memory , but when he was at his hollowest , wandering about some minor battlefield in Tennessee , he could swallow a spansule , feel it turn warm , take root , and flower under his ribs . So it was that Williston Bibb Barrett once again set forth into the wide world at the age of twenty-five , Keats ' age at his death , in possession of $8.35 , a Tetzlar telescope , an old frame house , and a defunct plantation . Once again he found himself alone in the world , cut adrift from Dr. Gamow , a father of sorts , and his alma mater , sweet mother psychoanalysis .
