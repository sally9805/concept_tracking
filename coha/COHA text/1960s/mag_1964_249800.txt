" I could never follow the story of Raymonda , ' " complained Prince Peter Lieven , after seeing the Marius Petipa-Alexander Glazunov ballet , which was premiered at St. Petersburg 's Maryin-sky Theater in 1898 . <P> Raymonda , as revised and presented last week by Leningrad 's Kirov Ballet at Manhattan 's Metropolitan Opera House , makes no more sense . There 's still the wicked Saracen and the noble Hungarian knight named Jean de Brienne , a duel , an attempted abduction , a wed ding , Spanish and Moorish dances , and of course the maiden Raymonda herself . <P> But the absence of a plot is no disaster .

The Kirov versions of Swan Lake and The Sleeping Beauty are impeccable , if cold . All the principal dancers are technically irreproachable . If they lack the idiosyncrasies that make great stars out of merely superb dancers , at least there is the consoling virtue that it does not matter much , except to close students of the dance , which ballerina is seen in any particular performance . And no U.S. company , lacking the Government subsidy that makes Russian ballet the most pampered of proletarian arts , can provide the costuming and scenery that creates the magical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not spend her honeymoon water-skiing but soars to the sky on seemingly gossamer wings-with no political complications whatever .
