txt After months of study and revision , New York City ! has asked the Federal Government to approve the heart of its antipoverty drive  --  a community action program covering almost 30 proposals that would cost $18,172,829 . The proposals are supposed to touch most of the poor neighborhoods in the city . They already are touching many exposed nerves in the controversial antipoverty drive . Community action means giving the poor people the power to solve their own problems . It means giving them a collective voice to be heard when their garbage is n't picked up , when the landlords cheat them , when their schoolteachers ignore them , when the labor market shuns them and when their elected officials refuse to listen to them . It means , fundamentally , giving people a means of fighting City Hall . It is City Hall , ironically , that is trying to obtain the money to get the program started . There are indications that the money is going to be on its way soon . Objections had been ) raised , here and in Washing- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual planning and administration of the program . Now , according to sources in the antipoverty operation , the structure of city agencies is going to be changed so that the poor will be represented . City Council President Paul R. Screvane , who heads the Poverty Operations Board , said of the poor , in a recent inter-view : " We 're going to put those ' people on the citywide board so they can rub elbows with the archbishop and the powerful heads of the voluntary organizations . " The ( immunity action pro-. gram , while it is the Most aginative ' of . . the city 's . efforts , is still , a part of New York 's over-all antipoverty drive . The city now supports , welfare  --  employment , education , housing and institutional programs costing $907.3 million a year . These programs are aimed at about 1.7 Million persons who live in what is generally accepted as poverty ? families making $3,000 or less a year and individuals making $2,000 or less . For the most part , the programs have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of efforts that are being started . under the Federal program , as a result of the enactment last Aug. 20 of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 . The act made $800 million available nationally . New York City quickly joined the list of communities that established formal agencies to coordinate their antipoverty programs and take advantage of the new funds . More Groups Likely The agency formed here was the Poverty Operations Board , an 11-member committee of city department heads and officials to review and administer Federally supported projects in the city . This board is likely to be supplemented by the addition of another planning group so that a significant percentage of the antipoverty policy makers are actually poor persons , selected from the poor neighborhoods . Since the board was founded six months ago , there have been frequent charges that the antipoverty program is not going in the proper direction . And there is a worry not being expressed in public ? namely a widespread concern by officials of the antipoverty program over possible racial riots this summer . Partly because of this concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request had official starting dates of May 1 , based on the hope that approval would have been re , ceived from Washington by then . In the meantime , the city 's antipoverty operation presses on , amid controversy , criticism , and an uncertain summertime deadline , toward a beginning in New York 's drive to ' ' counteract and absorb the effects of poverty , " to help people lift themselves out of their poverty , and to combat the discrimination that forces so many minority groups into poverty . Bitterness vs . Excitement Some front-line workers in the antipoverty campaign are bitter about the pressure that is being put on them to produce success stories on short notice . Others exhibit excitement over their work . In the offices of the Poverty Operations Board , across the street from City Hall at 250 Broadway , there are clockwatchers who worry about coffee breaks , and there are many more workers who put in free overtime with the zeal of Peace Corpsmen . All of them are working on a massive program taking shape under the Economic Opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs . These include the domestic Peace Corps , or Volunteers in Service to America ; the Job Corps , and a work-study program for impoverished college students . In these programs the city acts as a screening or recruiting agency for the Federal or academic sponsors . There is also a project to find jobs for 1,700 welfare recipients , a program to encourage small businesses , an adult education program for 1,650 persons , and a Neighborhood Youth Corps project for 5,700 youths . Then there is the heart of the antipoverty campaign  --  community action . The Federal act defines a community action program as one that " mobilizes and utilizes resources , public or private , " in a given geographk cat area to provide " services , ! assistance and other activities of sufficient scope and size to , give promise of progress to-1 ward elimination of poverty . " This is done " through developing employment opportunities , improving human performance , motivation and productivity , or , bettering the conditions under . which people live , learn and work . " Although the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its details are being changed from day today . One reason for this is the increasing ' pressure on City Hall to provide what the Federal act calls the " maximum feasbile participation " of poor persons in the program . 6 Centers Planned As it now stands , however , the city 's program calls for six ! neighborhood offices , which will ! be called Community Progress Centers . These are to be estab-1 lished to serve the South Bronx . Manhattan 's West Side , East Harlem , the Williamsburg , and Brownsville sections of ! Brooklyn , and Jamaica , Queens. ! The centers will cost $6,417,200 ' , for the first eight months . Each will have a director , a , community committee , liaison workers between the center and the outside worlds of business and . government , a community organizer , and about 45 block workers recruited from the neighborhood to serve as sources of two-way comniunication between the center and the neighborhood . The centers will develop youth and adult projects , in which neighborhood people will serve as nonprofessional aides in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , legal services , and efforts to coordinate existing city services . There are more than two dozen other elements of the comH community action program that the Poverty Operations Board refers to as components or satellites of the Community Progress Centers . A partial list of the components , taken from the files of the board , includes the following , with tentative eightmonth budgets : , - tlASPIRA , founded in 1962 by : the Puerto Rican Forum , Inc : , to develop a community education and action program : pima flEast Harlem Block Nurscry Schools , sponsored by the forum. , to develop bilingnalnursery ? . sehOols to serve-420 . children by next September . $72,679 .

A few programs have received , funds already . Most of them , ' ! however , are still in the final planning stages . Of the programs already started , Haryou-Act in Harlem is perhaps the best known . Haryou-Act , with a three-year budget of $118 million , operates an employment program , a cadet corps for the more deprived children , and 20 after- , school sttidy centers that attract about 20,000 schoolchildren Under another Federal - city program already in operation , ! 37 apartment buildings on 114th ! ' Street , between Seventh and ! Eighth Avenues , are being renivated , a few at the time so ! that residents will not have to ' , leave the neighborhood .

Persons in the depressed areas , , a broken leg. - or worry over one 's homework is enough to ! qualify a resident for assistance . Dr. ? Fret* Wessman , a psychologist : and co-director of the ! project with Emanuel Hallo- . Witz , said recently in an inter- , ! view that he believed that the neighborhood 's residents " can bel moved , through service , very , very slowly to form small social groups , and then to move , on ' to larger . community action ! campaigns . " The center , the first of four to be established in the South Bronx , employs local , nonprofessional workers to serve as mental health aides . Actually , they are liaison persons trusted , by the rest of the community . ' The first center has attracted an average of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the rest of the community . action programs , will be under , close scrutiny by the Federal , city , and private agencies that are providing the money . It is likely that controversies will build up over each of the elements of the antipoverty ! program . Disputes over methods and allegations of political involvement are expected . After a recent tour or Haryou-Act , Senator Robert ! F. Kennedy reminded the leaders of the Harlem agency that they 'd better get used to " living in a fishbowl . " Yesterday Representative Hugh L. Carey , Brooklyn Democrat , undertook a similar inspection at Mobilization for Youth . Congress , he commented afterwards , " is getting a little ! impatient with demonstration ! projects " and wants some proof ! that . the campaigns against ! poverty and delinquency are working . Another of the area 's Repre ! sentatiVes was heard to counsel the officials of a poverty ! agency that he wanted some action right now , before summer sets in . " A dollar spent in the summertime , " lie said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is worth 10 bucks ! in the wintertime . " Now the dollars are about to come from Washington . The antipoverty program , beset by pressures from all sides , will ! soon meet its toughest test .
