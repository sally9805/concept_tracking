Many a working man still counts on overtime to finance a vacation or a new TV set , but the top ranks of labor increasingly regard the institution as more of a bane than a blessing . Their criticism reflects a growing union feeling that overtime work is stealing a chance to work from the nation 's jobless , and their demands to curb it rank with the 35-hour week as a favored solution to high unemployment . In a bow to organized labor , President Johnson joined the attack in his State of the Union message by proposing a study to consider penalties against companies that regularly schedule excessive overtime to avoid hiring extra workers . <P> The President 's penalties could involve legislation ordering companies to pay workers double or even triple time for extra hours worked ; but no serious consideration is expected from Congress this year . Nonetheless , U.S. labor unions are dead earnest about curbing overtime on their own . In Detroit , proposals to curtail overtime will be one of the key issues that Walter Reuther 's United Auto Workers will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel industry 's labor-management human relations committee is already grappling with the question , and the Rubber Workers , the Cement Masons , the Machinists and the Oil , Chemical and Atomic Workers are among the many other unions strongly opposed to any more than a bare amount of overtime . <P> Asking for More . Many oldtimers are willing to go along with union opposition to overtime because they do not want or need to put in extra hours at work ; average factory wages in December , after all , hit a new record of $102 a week , or $2.50 an hour . But the bulk of younger workers , burdened with the expenses of setting up households , are eager for any additional cash . Says William Goldmann , assistant regional director for the U.A.W. in Los Angeles , " Our members start complaining about excessive overtime , and we get them down to nine or ten hours a day . They work like that for a while , and then they come to us and say they want more overtime . " <P> Any Government attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many companies prefer to schedule overtime rather than train someone new , because experienced hands give them better work and save them the expense of added fringe benefits for a new employee . The industries with some of the heaviest overtime are autos , where workers spend 5.4 extra hours a week in the plant , cement ( 6.6 hr. ) , grain mill products ( 7.3 hr. ) , and paper ( 5.6 hr . ) . Thus , even with overtime , few workers work more than a 46-hour week . <P> The Impetus . Labor Secretary Wirtz insists that hiring new employees instead of working old ones overtime would have increased employment by more than 900,000 last year , but industry hotly disputes this . In the steel industry , most overtime is worked when employees fail to show up for shifts , and no new hiring would be feasible in such cases . The auto industry has dragged in every available trained worker to keep up with the sales race , and Detroit companies have even gone to South Bend to recruit laid-off Studebaker workers . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need production right now .
