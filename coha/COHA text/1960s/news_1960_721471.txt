txt The deep-seated pacificism that is a strong but often unrecognized element in the British character has found sufficient voice at the Labor party conference this week to force narrow approval of a policy that could lead to unilateral nuclear disarmament , abolition of missile bases in Great Britain and  --  in the last analysis  --  rejection of the North Atlantic Alliance . On the face of it , such a policy represents a sensational expression of neutralism by an important segment of public opinion in the country that is , along with Canada , our closest friend and stanchest ally in the defense of freedom . There is no doubt that if the policy adopted at the conference were to be carried out by a future Labor Government , the whole structure of military protection of the West against the threat of Soviet aggression would have to be reorganized . There is also no doubt that the free world 's ability to resist actual or potential Soviet aggression would be gravely weakened by such a policy . But before we allow ourselves to jump to such gloomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the first place , the body that adopted this policy was the party conference , not the Parliamentary Labor party , i. e. , not the members of the Labor party in Parliament , who of course take part in the conference but do not dominate it , and are not necessarily controlled by it . In the second place , the pertinent resolutions were barely put across by some of the large LeftWing trade unions through a system of " block voting , " under which the unions cast a vote proportionate to the strength of their membership . Many British observers believe that the leadership of these unions thus manages to exert a voting influence unrelated to the real feeling of their own rank and file as it would be expressed if the specific resolutions were voted on in a true referendum . In : the third place , the leader of the Labor party , Hugh Gaitskell , is totally opposed to the unilateral nuclear disarmament policy , is completely committed to NATO , and has said he would fight the conference decisions , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if the party overwhelmingly favored the position expressed at the conference , it is still very much in the minority ) n Great Britain . It has lost the last three general elections , each time by a wider margin than the time before , and it is torn apart  --  as the present debate clearly shows  --  by dissension on this most important of foreign-policy issues , as well as by sharp disagreement over such domestic issues as nationalization , on which the moderates headed by Mr. Gaitskell won a significant victory yesterday . The Manchester Guardian , while praising Mr. Gaitskell , warns that the action of the conference must not be dismissed as an " odd aberration of silly Socialists , " but must be viewed as an expression of genuine " anxiety underlying opposition to NATO " in Britain . While it would be wrong for American policymakers to make too much of the neutralist sentiment expresser at the conference , it would be equally foolish ti disregard it .                @ @ @ @ @
