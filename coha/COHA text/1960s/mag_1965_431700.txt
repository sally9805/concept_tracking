 | Why Good Parents Have " Problem " Children , , WHAT DID 1 do wrong ? " Why is Johnny so selfish , Mary so often in trouble , Steven so wasting of his talents ? Where is there a parent so good , so wise , that he never has to lie awake asking himself such questions ? Why ca n't you " train a child in the way he should go " and be sure he will walk in it ? Psychologists and psychiatrists have many answers but they all boil down to one : Mothers and fathers have trouble with their children because the best of parents are never quite good enough . Nor can they be . First , parents , like everyone else , have their full share of frailty . My own mother was once in her youth savagely attacked by a dog . She was never able to overcome her fear of dogs , and her children could not fai to feel its contagion . A parent bear , the mark of what handicaps then were in his own environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistakes and prejudices of his own era . Necessarily , too , good mothers and fathers have periods of preoccupation , stress or strain when they can not think as clearly or help their children as wisely as at other times Parents have off-seasons and so di children . Second , parents must meet the challenge of children who are no like themselves . Our children are no carbon copies of us . They are Aun Emma 's children , too , and Grandpa Brown 's ; and sometimes they bear @#  | the traits of ancestors long forgotten . While behavioral psychology was having its heyday , we persuaded ourselves that our children came to us like a blank slate ready to be written on . It is not true . Now we are beginning to understand that a child is more like a musical instrument already tuned ? on which he , and his parents , can play only the music written for it . Most psychologists and psychiatrists today agree that , to a large ex tent , the child 's basic temperament comes with him into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wholly fortuitous combination of genes . Deep down every parent knew it long ago . From the hour of birth babies differ , not my in size , weight , and color of hair and skin , but also in their responses to the world . Some are active , others placid ; some cry lustily , others hardly at all . John is not Richard ; Richard is tuft John ; and the best of mothers and fathers can not alter that . Nor can they alter the regrettable fact that they may be wonderful parents for John and not do so well for Richard . By the accidents of heredity , a hild may be a fine little person who ould simply have been more at Anne with other parents . I'hird , parents must meet the challenge of a world unlike the one in which they grew up . In the best of times , parents are bound to have difficulty seeing things from the child 's point of view . " We did n't act like that when we were young , " they say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not imagine what it is to be only as high as a chair ; what it is to want , desperately and urgently , what we ourselves as parents no longer want at all . And we are just beginning to understand that in violently changing times like these the gulf may be even greater than usual . Fourth , children do not live in a tight little world inhabited only by mother and dad and themselves . Mother and dad want Johnny to study . But studying too much may make him a sissy in the eyes of other children . Mom and dad may want him to obey . But the child who is perfectly obedient might seem like a traitor to his peers , engaged as they are in the mysterious vendetta between children and adults . A materialistic world like ours is particularly powerful . For example , many a parent finds that , however strongly he may feel about cars for teen-agers , he is bucking a tide too powerful for him . " I told Tom he could n't drive until he was 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time I was out of town he took the car out without a license and smashed it up . " Finally , parents can not rear a child ' who is just as they want him to be , because the child has an immemorial right to grow up and away from them . It is even possible that they may mistake his inarticulate efforts to do so for delinquency or lack of  | love . They may feel they have failed when in fact they are succeeding . " It seems as though I ca n't do anything right , " sighed one mother after all her suggestions for her 13-yearold daughter 's birthday party had been repulsed . " As soon as Nora gets the idea that it 's something I approve , she automatically turns it down . " There are many Noras , but most of them will grow up to love and appreciate the parents they are now flouting . Right now they are simply breaking out of a room too small for them . Psychiatrists and psychologists repeatedly point out that the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ties of dependence on mother and dad . A child does not become an adult simply by getting bigger and better , but rather by leaving behind something of what he was and replacing it with something else . The trouble is , parents can not truly wish to see their child break out of the bonds of their love , to become this outsider whose ambitions , dreams and thoughts seem so alarmingly unlike their own . They may want to want it , but that is not the same thing . In his efforts to break free , efforts in which he fights his own love and dependence as well as theirs , the teen-ager may get rough . There are , come to think of it , few graceful ways to break out of any relationship , and the child , immature and socially inept , does n't know them . In short , no matter how wise , mothers and fathers can not wholly avoid trouble with the unpredictable creatures given into their custody by the accident of birth . But fortunately parents can lengthen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , if parents can simply accept the fact that a child is a child , a beginning human being , with much to learn and a long way to go . The child 's personality , said Dr. Arnold Gesell , for many years head of the Child Study Center at Yale , " is a product of slow and gradual growth . He sits before he stands , he babbles before he talks ; he says no ' before he says yes ' ; he is selfish before he is altruistic ; he is dependent on others before he achieves dependence on self . All of his abilities are subject to laws of growth . " And nothing that a good parent can do makes it possible for a child to accomplish what he has not yet grown up to . A good question for any parent to 1 put to himself is this : how can I expect my child to learn from a few words of instruction what it has taken 20 or 30 years for me to learn by a process of painful experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without reservation that their children are not carbon copies of themselves . If we can believe without question that we are adding to the world 's human riches unique individuals ? unlike us , unlike anyone ? then we can cease trying to mold these elusive little creatures into forms they do not want to take . " Our goal , " says psychiatrist Frances  | Wickes , " is to help in the creation of a free individual so that he may follow his own path whether or not that path is the one we would have chosen for him . " But of course these answers are not the whole answer to the problem . There seems to be no doubt whatsoever that parents who have the least trouble with their children take the task of discipline seriously . Psychologists , once so permissive , now point out that the worst thing we can do to our children is to be too kind , for children whose parents love them too much to punish them are like pedestrians wandering in traffic where there are no stop signs . Frightenecd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior . It is though they were saying , " If we get snarled up enough , somebody will have to take over . " It 's sobering to find that children themselves frequently testify they 'd like their parents to be stricter . In a survey taken a few years ago , one high-school child in five thought the discipline in his life inadequate ; 13 percent even felt that a good whack s a fine idea ! " Maybe I 'm old-fashioned , " a young mother told me after she had dispatched a whining , showing-off five-year-old to her room , " but I ca n't believe that being allowed to make everybody else miserable now is going to make her more lovable 20 years from now . " Perhaps parents would not be so afraid of discipline if they could think of it as something more than punishment and reward . In fact , it is a question of putting our children so in control of themselves that they can use their best qualities . It is a question of giving them the ability to make decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of knowledge or wisdom on the part of parents can guarantee that their children will grow up well . But certainly a child is far less likely to get into trouble if his mother and father find delight in living with him , if they are brave enough to hold him to the standards of performance we call discipline , and if they can take him as they take themselves ? frail and full of faults , but moved now and then by a dream so big there are no words for it . @#
