As Secretary of State Dean Rusk , Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko and their aides sat down to lunch at the Soviet Mission to the U.N . in Manhattan , someone discovered that a package of Russian cigarettes on the table bore the brand name Troika . This allusion to the Soviet U.N . policy created general hilarity . The actual remarks are not known , but it is just possible that someone asked Gromyko : " Are you vetoing more and enjoying it less ? " <P> The luncheon-table jollity was typical of the successive Gromyko-Rusk meetings so far , described by one participant as " perfectly genial , perfectly agreeable . " Behind the geniality , of course , was the deadly serious purpose of finding out whether a Berlin compromise is possible . The seriousness was acknowledged by Gromyko. who has developed into an inveterate knee-tapper , prodding his own and his opponents ' knees with a blunt finger for emphasis ; although Gromyko speaks English reasonably well , he insisted on conducting the Rusk negotiations in Russian through an interpreter to make sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the talk concerned words . The men around the table sounded more like semanticists than diplomats , exploring the precise meaning of such terms , widely used by the Russians on Berlin , as " access . " " free city " and " guarantees . " <P> New Ingredients . Both the Kennedy and Gromyko speeches before the U.N . last week made clear that both sides want negotiations on Berlin . Furthermore , the possible ingredients of a deal are beginning to take shape . Very tentatively , the U.S. is considering : <P> &gt; Some form of recognition or at least acceptance of the East German Communist regime . <P> &gt; Acceptance of the Oder-Neisse line as the eastern border of East Germany ( and , therefore , of a future United Germany ) . <P> &gt; Agreement not to give West Germany atomic weapons . <P> &gt; Some change in West Berlin 's present status , possibly by reducing the number of Western troops there as pressure decreases . <P> <P> If the U.S. were to agree to make any or all of these concessions ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of them , given the right conditions ) , how much would the U.S. be losing ? <P> In one view , little or nothing . The existence of the East German regime and the Oder-Neisse line are facts of life that probably can not be reversed short of war ; as for West German atomic armaments . Adenauer wants them but the U.S. is far from eager to give them . With West Berlin 's population already nervous , any change in West Berlin 's status or in the size of Western forces there would pose a severe morale problem ; but , after all , even the present number of Allied troops in the city ( 14,000 ) is not a force that could hold back the Reds-only a symbol of Western " presence . " In short , it can be argued that the various steps under consideration would not really add up to Western concessions , but merely to a " realistic " acceptance of the facts .                   @ @
