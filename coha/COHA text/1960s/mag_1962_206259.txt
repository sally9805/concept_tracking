DEFENSE <P> Defense Secretary Robert McNamara has been under fire from some big guns because of his go-slow approach to the development of the RS-70 , the Air Force 's reconnaissance-strike superbomber . First , General Curtis LeMay , the Air Force 's cigar-chomping Chief of Staff , bluntly charged that McNamara was endangering the nation 's security . Then Chairman Carl Vinson of the House Armed Services Committee sided with LeMay , backed a bill that would give the Pentagon a direct order to speed construction of the RS-70 . Last week McNamara , his patience gone , called a press conference to fire a salvo of facts and figures calculated to shoot down the RS-70-and his critics as well . <P> The RS-70 is the Air Force 's new version of the controversial 2,000-m.p.h . B70 which both the Eisenhower and Kennedy Administrations cut back out of fear that the sleek bomber would be outmoded by missiles before it ever got into the air . This year the Air Force wants to modify the B70 plans and build the RS-70 , which would be designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspect the damage by radar , radio back reports and attack surviving targets with nuclear-tipped missiles . LeMay and Vinson , insisting that the U.S. will continue to need such bombers for some time , want to spend $491 million next fiscal year on a crash program to develop the RS-70 . McNamara and President Kennedy want to spend only $171 million to continue development of three prototype RS-70s . <P> With all the information on file in his mind , McNamara ticked off his case against the RS-70 : <P> Since the RS-70 could not be adapted for airborne alert-patrolling the skies with a full load of arms-it would be a sitting duck on the ground for any surprise attack . Nor could the high-altitude RS-70 dodge enemy radar by streaking in for low-level attacks . <P> The fleet of 150 RS-70s called for by the Air Force would cost $10 billion by 1970 , more than half of the Air Force budget for this year . <P> By 1967 , when the Air Force would just be getting its RS-70s into operation , the U.S. will be protected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 650 Polaris missiles carried by submarines and more than 700 B-52s and B-58s . Without a single RS-70 , said McNamara , U.S. retaliatory forces " would achieve practically complete destruction of the enemy target system-even after absorbing an initial nuclear attack . " <P> The RS-70 could do its job only if equipped with highly sophisticated electronic gear and nuclear missiles that have not even been designed , let alone built . McNamara proposed spending an additional $52 million next fiscal year to see if the electronic equipment planned for the RS-70 is feasible . <P> Only a day after McNamara 's salvo , Air Force Secretary Eugene M. Zuckert stopped pushing for a stepped-up RS-70 program and fell in line with the Defense Secretary . That arrayed President Kennedy , McNamara , all three service secretaries and every member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff except Curt LeMay behind a throttled-back RS-70 program . Undeterred , Carl Vinson 's committee sent to the House its bill to force the RS-70 on the Administration .                @ @ @ @ @
