The Time : December 31st The Place : Chris 's home On the last day of the year Chris is home with his wife , his son , and his daughter , but he 's gone to bed , and his son 's trying on his red boots , while his daughter watches . A man is seated on the sofa , a briefcase at his feeet . The Christmas tree is in the corner . A long table has food on it . BOY ( Studies man ) Got your briefcase ? MAN Yes , I have . BOY Got your papers in your your briefcase ? MAN Yes , I have . GIRL ( To Boy ) You 're going to be a great man someday . BOY Just let me be half as great as my father and I 'll be satisfied . GIRL Half as crazy , is that what you mean ? BOY Do n't tell me my father 's crazy . I do n't care what your father is , my father is the greatest man in the world . GIRL You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What makes you think so ? GIRL Well , for one thing you insist on admiring father 's worst behavior . Look at you now , for instance , standing around in those boots , as if for all the world you were father himself about to take off on another rampage of righteous merriment in a fantasy world of vindictive and insincere love . Inasmuch as you 're fifteen years old , a whole year older than myself , I 'm sure it 's not too soon to let you know that father is not a merry old soul at all  --  quite the contrary , three hundred and fifty-nine days of the year he is a perfectly normal old grouch , but for six days a year he becomes terribly sick and speaks in a deep and loving voice . p. 3 BOY You take that back ! GIRL Take what back ? BOY Insincere . My father 's love is not insincere . GIRL No ? Then , would n't he remember his own son and his own daughter with a little something during the six-day rampage ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's their gift . Would you rather have another kind of gift ? GIRL I think I might . BOY What , for instance ? GIRL Well , suppose I begin with clothes ? BOY What for ? GIRL I 'm a woman . BOY So what ? GIRL I want to be attractive . BOY Why ? GIRL So I can capture a man . BOY What for ? GIRL So I can have his children , the way mother had father's.  --  Pretty dresses , pretty shoes , pretty hats , a little jewelry , a little perfume  --  once a year , just once a year , but no , that 's for other girls , not for his own daughter . p. 4 BOY I do n't want to talk to you any more . GIRL Of course not , because you 're just as crazy as he is . BOY Oh , yeah ? Well , I 'd rather be crazy the way he is than foolish the way  --  ( He looks around , suddenly points at the visitor ) he is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOY Well , look at him . GIRL I am looking , and I 'd say he 's rather composed . BOY You would ? GIRL Yes , of course . He 's sat there in the same place without moving ever since he saw father come in the back way about an hour ago . BOY Perhaps he 's dead . I certainly wish he had n't been born . GIRL Oh , I do n't know . He does have a right to sit there and wait . BOY It 's a kind of right only somebody foolish would be eager to exercise , though . GIRL I only hope he does n't have to sit there a whole week , as he did last year . BOY It 's his work . If he wants to do work like that , well , all I can say is , he 's foolish . p. 5 GIRL You must try to choose your words with a little better feeling for accuracy . Composed , yes . Foolish , no . Choose your words . BOY I do n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean what I mean , and you always know what I mean , only you try to pretend you do n't . I said it before and I 'll say it again . I 'd rather be crazy the way my father is than foolish the way  --  ( Points at man ) he is . He believes in facts ! That whole briefcase is full of them . GIRL What would you have him believe in instead ? BOY Not instead , just in addition to . No harm in believing in facts if you believe in everything else , too . GIRL Well , the fact is that father owes him a great deal of money . BOY Not at all . Father owes a lot of other people a lot of money , and these other people have hired him to threaten father with all kinds of consequences if father does n't pay him the money father owes them . ( To the man ) Is n't that so ? MAN Yes , it is . BOY Fact number one . He 's a bill collector , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 MAN I have nothing against your father . BOY Then why do n't you go home ? MAN I have a job to do . BOY You want to hand my father a summons and take him to court . MAN It 's my job , and I have eleven summonses to hand him . BOY There were only nine last year . MAN He opened two new accounts this year . BOY Why do you let him open new accounts ? GIRL Why argue with him ? He 's just a bill collector . MAN I am an attorney at law . BOY Same thing . MAN Different thing entirely . Difference of considerable education . BOY Considerable schooling , not education . If you so much as knew the meaning of the word I believe you would be a chiropractor . MAN Why should I be a chiropractor ? GIRL The point is , why do they let father buy all sorts of things every year when they know he ca n't pay ? p. 7 MAN My dear young lady , I wonder if you know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rampage , as you put it . Obviously , he convinces them that this time he is going to make his idea work . GIRL Oh , the idea works all right . It 's just that it does n't add up to anything . He buys all sorts of things , he gives them to all sorts of people , he comes home , and then he 's in all sorts of trouble . Every year . MAN Yes , that does seem to be the history of the case . BOY I hope to tell you . MAN And at that point , naturally , I 'm called in . BOY Why , naturally ? Why would n't it be just as natural to call in an Award Committe to select a suitable award for father ? MAN To be perfectly honest , I do n't know . In any case , I 'm always called in at this stage of the game . BOY Just what do you expect to accomplish ? MAN There is an economic principle involved that must not be violated  --  by any man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course not . Still , the principle is , if you buy , you must pay , and it does n't matter what you buy or why you buy it or what you do with it , or why . Things cost money and must be paid for in money . p. 8 BOY Well , my father has no money . MAN So I gather . BOY So what are you doing here ? MAN Protecting the principle . A whole complex economic structure is maintained by the protection of the principle . GIRL Is it possible the structure does n't deserve to be maintained ? MAN It is , I daresay . I did n't major in economics , but a study of certain basic fundamentals of it were required , so I know a little something about it . That is the reason I am an attorney , I suppose . It did n't take me long to realize that I could never buy anything without money , or to notice that when there 's a quarrel over money it is a good idea to be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quarrel from deteriorating into robbery , murder , or some other obvious crime . Here , for instance . I represent eleven manufacturers from whom your father recently made substantial purchases involving substantial sums of money . My job is to seek to get your father to pay these manufacturers in full , but even if I am not able to get your father to pay so much as one dollar , I myself , and my own firm , will be handsomely rewarded . Economics . GIRL But father was n't in his right mind when he made the purchases . p. 9 MAN Well , whatever mind he may have been in at the time , the fact remains that he did get the merchandise , and I may say I have a sneaking admiration for his ability to do so year after year . BOY You just keep bothering him , though , and next year he wo n't even try to make the purchases . MAN First things first . Next year is next year . GIRL And it begins in a matter of six or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may I say now that I wish you both a very happy new year . It 's rather understandable that you might find me uninteresting , but I may say that I find you this year even more interesting than I found you last . GIRL We 've done a lot of growing up since last year . I 'll never forget how astonished and shocked I was at father 's ranting and raving last year , instead of understanding that it was unavoidable . It 's not going to bother me at all this year . He 's been crazy for a week , and now he 's coming out of it , that 's all . MAN He 's an unusual man . I do n't suppose he 's ever gone about the business of living as other men have . BOY I hope to tell you he has n't . MAN Everybody admires him . p. 10 GIRL Admires and loves him , or rather admires and loves his personality when he 's desperately ill and full of charm . MAN I 've often wondered why his illness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOY You have ? MAN Yes , I have , and I may say I 've never quite been able to account for it . GIRL Well , it certainly has something to do with another whole year having gone by . MAN Yes , it has , and of course they say it 's better to give than to receive , but I never knew a healthy man who ever acted as if he believed that . BOY I wish both of you would just try to lay off a little about father 's illness . Father is the healthiest man in the world . GIRL He would be , I suppose , if everybody else were , but let 's face it , nobody else is healthy , either . No , father is always sick , but terribly so for a week just before the year ends . BOY Well , he 's home again , and he 's trying to get a little rest before the New Year celebrations begin . ( To man ) I think it would be rather courteous of you to get up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , really , why do n't you ? MAN Oh , I wish I could , but I ca n't . I 'm terribly sorry . I have responsibilities to my clients . Reports to make . It 's my profession . A rather difficult one at times , but then again what 's a man to do ? I have the same problems your father has , and my children have the same problems . you have . Your father lives as he must , and I live as I must . I have often wished I had been born very rich , so that I might never need to be involved in any kind of human anxiety and could spend my time taking my family sailing , although none of us is an expert swimmer , and if we were ship-wrecked in a storm it might be the end for the whole lot of us . GIRL Oh , that would be a pity . BOY How many of you are there ? MAN We 're four , as you are . It seems that few of us can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can afford more than one wife , at any rate . In my youth I now and then believed it would be quite interesting if I were somehow able to have a wife from among each of the different peoples of the world , because it seemed to me that my children would be awfully different from one another and still be my own , insofar as any children are a father 's . BOY You had an idea like that ? p. 12 MAN Oh , yes . GIRL An English wife , for instance ? MAN Yes , precisely . GIRL A son and a daughter , and then perhaps a French wife ? MAN Yes . GIRL Another son and another daughter , and then perhaps something a little farther afield  --  MAN Yes , perhaps a young lady from  --  well , Borneo . And then one from Norway , and then one from  --  well , I thought somebody from Spain , and then one from Italy , Japan , Greece , Russia , Germany , China , Persia , India . Oh , when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Even so , I still sometimes remember that strange thought , and I wonder what those children would be like in the world today . GIRL Well , let 's hope they would n't all be bill collectors . MAN Oh , I would n't ever have become an attorney had I gone ahead with that idea . GIRL I should say not . BOY What would you have become ? MAN Oh , I 'd have ships on the seven seas , I suppose . That would be how I 'd get to those places . p. 13 BOY Why did n't you do it ? MAN I got cold feet . As a matter of fact , I kept getting colds in my head , too . With my nose running , I could n't quite see myself equal to all that  --  travel . BOY Were the girls pretty ? MAN Oh , yes . GIRL Did you love them ? MAN Oh , yes . But not  --  not the way it is when , with a cold in your head , and your nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swiftly ) I loved them , and they loved me , and we loved the children , but somehow we were all of us always free , and unafraid , and without anxieties , and none of us had anything against anybody , and we just did n't know what it was to hate  --  we just could n't think of such a thing . There just never was any reason to hate anybody . It was a fantasy entirely . By the time I was nineteen I knew it was . The legal profession for me , I said to myself . And I do n't think I 've ever really regretted it . GIRL Would you marry them ? MAN Marriage is a rather complicated word , but yes of course , if they wanted me to marry them . I would n't in my wildest speculations on a new kind of human family want to marry a girl who did n't want me to marry her . p. 14 BOY Why do n't you go home ? MAN I do n't believe I understand how our conversation brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've told us your best idea , my father 's asleep , you 're married , you 've got two children of your own , it 's almost New Year 's Eve , my father has n't got any money , what 's the use staying here any longer ? MAN But I explained all that . I 've got to stay . I 've got to hand your father the eleven summonses . I 've got to turn in my report . I 've got to earn my living , so I can keep up the payments on my home , pay doctor 's bills , buy food and clothes for my children , put away a few dollars , so my children can go to good schools  --  I simply have got to stay unless I suddenly decide I do n't want to go on with any of it at all , and I 'm afraid I have n't the courage to do that . I hope you understand that my involvement with your father is entirely impersonal . I do admire him , I do even sympathize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea I abandoned at nineteen , and much nobler . All the same , I still wonder what it would be like to marry one girl of each kind , and what the children would be like in a cultural system like that . GIRL They 'd be exactly like the children in this cultural system  --  very eager to stop being children , and get on with it . p. 15 MAN I suppose . GIRL They 'd expect to live a little more intelligently than their mothers and fathers . MAN Yes , I suppose . BOY So why do n't you go home and let my father come out and see nothing worse than the same old walls and floor and ceiling and furniture and faces ? Is that asking too much ? MAN I 'm afraid it is . We live in real world , a hard world , a mean world , an anxious , lonely , frightened , and angry world . I 'm part of the anxiety and loneliness and fear and anger , as each of us is . I must put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must put up with the part I am . That 's our story , and until we cook up a better one , we 've just got to keep trying to put up with one another . I have nothing against your father . I hope his sleep is deep , and that he dreams of better things than I do . I must stay and do my work . I 'm sorry . ( Chris 's wife comes in with a tray loaded with tea and stuff . Man gets up , to help : takes tray ) WIFE I did n't mean to leave you alone with the children , but I simply had to look after my poor husband . He 'll be quite difficult until the third or fourth day of January , after the strain of the past week . Do please have some tea and sandwiches . p. 16 MAN Thank you . WIFE ( Pouring ) Sugar , lemon , cream ? MAN Sugar and lemon . I 'll help myself , if I may . WIFE Thank you . Now , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter 's legal ? MAN Yes . WIFE In what way ? GIRL Oh , mother , the same way as last year ! Father owes a lot of money to a lot of manufacturers . Our visitor has eleven summonses to serve on father , which means that father will have to go to court eleven times and point out each time that he has no money . WIFE He has money , my dear . BOY How much ? WIFE Well , as a matter of fact , when I put his clothes away I did count it , and there is very nearly enough for the few things we have planned for the New Year 's celebration . We 're to have a bottle of domestic champagne , sandwiches , ginger ale , and ginger bread , which I shall bake the moment I 'm over the terrible feeling of nausea I 've had all day . GIRL Nausea , mother ? WIFE Oh , it 's nothing  --  just the excitement of seeing father home again , as if I did n't know he 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boy goes to door , opens it , and a Man of about fifty or so , comes in . He carries a doctor 's satchel ) How nice to see you again . I was hoping you 'd come by . p. 17 DOCTOR My dear , I come by every year at this time . He 's home and fast asleep of course ? WIFE Yes , he got in about an hour ago , tireder than last year , tireder than ever before , for that matter . ( To the men ) You know one another , I 'm sure . DOCTOR Yes , how are you ? MAN Quite well , thanks , Doctor . And you ? DOCTOR A little depressed , I 'm afraid . WIFE A cup of tea 'll take care of that . DOCTOR ( Pouring for himself ) Now , tell me , my dear , is he bad ? WIFE Quite cross , I 'm afraid . DOCTOR Any repeated remark of any kind ? WIFE Oh , yes  --  as usual . This time it 's , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until I got him to bed . DOCTOR He 's referring of course to the impracticality of the idea . WIFE I suppose so . He 's awfully tired . DOCTOR Voice heavy and harsh ? WIFE And speech swift and angry . p. 18 DOCTOR Well , then , there 's nothing new to worry about , at any rate . ( To the man ) I have a number of accounts that can well afford to pay , but they simply ignore the bills my nurse sends them . MAN Of course . A bill means nothing . But a bill with an ultimatum is another matter . DOCTOR What is your fee ? MAN Well , in the case of a doctor my firm would work on a percentage basis . DOCTOR What would the percentage be ? MAN Quite reasonable . DOCTOR How much ? MAN Oh , I do n't have the exact figures with me , but if we are able to collect without going to court , we would take something nominal . DOCTOR How much would you take ? MAN Thirty percent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAN You would receive seventy percent , net , instead of nothing at all . DOCTOR They may pay later on , in any case . MAN I doubt it . p. 19 DOCTOR They are all of them chronically ill of course , and I want to look after them as well as I 'm able to , but they ought to be willing to pay me for my services , particularly since they can well afford to . MAN I think I can safely say that my firm can get results . DOCTOR Thirty percent is more than I can afford . MAN Seventy percent in money is better than a hundred percent on paper . DOCTOR It is , at that , I suppose . And if you must take them to court ? MAN The fee is higher . DOCTOR How much higher ? MAN That would depend on how much time we spend preparing the necessary papers , the taking of depositions. the calling in of witnesses . and so on and so forth . DOCTOR I could never afford it . MAN We 've found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to appear in court ? MAN Oh , yes . DOCTOR I have n't got the time . I 'm in surgery from early morning to noon , I 'm in my office until six , after which I make house calls until dinner time . After dinner I 'm on call . If I tried to fit a court appearance into that schedule , my patients would suffer . p. 20 MAN But they do n't pay you . DOCTOR Some of them do n't . MAN Yes , and those are the ones we 'll get after . DOCTOR It 's too much trouble . MAN We would relieve you entirely of the whole problem until the case came to court , whereupon we would ask the court to hear your testimony immediately and let you go . DOCTOR How long would my testimony take ? MAN That would depend upon the defendant 's counsel 's technique of cross examination . DOCTOR Ten minutes ? MAN I 've never known of any counsel being able to obtain adequate testimony followed by adequate cross examination in ten minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly ? MAN Perhaps two hours . DOCTOR I have n't got the time . MAN It 's all routine . You 'll have nothing to think about at all . You must furnish my firm with all of the necessary information  --  when the patient came to you or asked you to call on him , what his illness was , what your treatment was , how much time you spent on the case , and the rest is up to us. p. 21 DOCTOR It 's too complicated . ( The Doctor holds his ' cup out to Chris 's Wife who lifts the pot , to pour ) WIFE I do hope everybody decides to pay you very soon . DOCTOR Thank you , my dear . ( For the tea , but also for the thought ) WIFE I 'll go sit beside him a moment . I have n't seen his face in a whole week . ( She goes ) GIRL What would you do with the extra money ? DOCTOR ( Thoughtfully ) Now . that 's strange  --  it never occurred to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd do anything with it . What would you do with it ? GIRL Nobody owes me any money . DOCTOR If they did , though , and paid you , what would you do ? GIRL Get married . DOCTOR But you 're not old enough to get married . GIRL I have n't got any money , either . DOCTOR But if you had some , you believe the money would help you to get married ? p. 22 GIRL Oh , yes . DOCTOR Have you picked out somebody ? GIRL No , just a kind . DOCTOR What kind ? GIRL All he 's got to be is wonderful . DOCTOR I 'm afraid you 'll have to search for him . Nobody 's wonderful  --  not for long . at any rate . GIRL Well , if he 's half-wonderful , love will make him all-wonderful . DOCTOR Do you really think so ? GIRL It certainly seems logical . Otherwise what good is love ? DOCTOR Quite good , apart from transforming the half-wonderful into the all-wonderful . GIRL How ? DOCTOR Well , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost unaccountable illogic , and a deeply tender scorn for the truth as revealed by the evidence , I daresay the gynecological aspects of my training and skill would very seldom be exercised . GIRL Do you mean men and women are all awful but get married and have children anyhow ? DOCTOR Awful ? I wonder if that 's the word we 're after . p. 23 GIRL Well , then , do you mean they 're not wonderful ? DOCTOR Quite the contrary . They are , and precisely because they really are n't at all . GIRL Do you mean , then , that they 're really wonderful because they 're really awful ? DOCTOR I think we 've over-simplified the matter . Let me see if I can put it this way : men and women are n't really awful . It 's just that an enormous number of unavoidable circumstances make them seem awful . GIRL Then you do believe everybody would be wonderful if circumstances permitted them to ? DOCTOR Yes , I do . MAN Even when they do n't pay their bills ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DOCTOR Perhaps they will pay later on . They can certainly afford to  --  most of them , although I must say getting after them with threats of all sorts  --  How did you happen to decide on thirty percent ? MAN Trial , error , loss  --  correction of error , profit . BOY Is that all people ever talk about ? Money ? p. 24 MAN I think you 'll learn soon enough that money is a large subject . BOY Even on New Year 's Eve ? MAN Especially then , for that is the proper time to take inventory , add , subtract , divide , multiply , and so on and so forth . ( Chris 's Wife comes back into the room ) DOCTOR Is he grumbling in his sleep ? Tossing and turning ? WIFE That 's just it . He 's not ! And I 'm quite worried . DOCTOR ( Gets up , takes her hands ) My dear , give him time . I 'm sure  --  But what about you ? Your hands are hot . Your face is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no . I 'm pefectly well . A little anxious about Chris , that 's all . I 've never interfered in his thinking , his approach to things  --  I do n't feel a wife should , but I must say Chris  --  well , he 's just not a young man any more , he 's not even the middle-aged man he 's been for so long any more . The ups and downs are much more extreme than they used to be . I do n't know what I 'd do if he were to die . GIRL Mother ! BOY Who says father 's going to die ? p. 25 DOCTOR He 's not going to die . WIFE I 've heard that said about so many people who have died . Every year more and more of them do  --  men and women we 've known for so long we 've never believed they could change , let alone die , and yet they do , one after another . DOCTOR My dear . Perhaps I 'd better have a look at him . WIFE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and he and Chris 's Wife go out , the Son and the Daughter and the Lawyer looking after them gravely ) BOY Father ? Die ? GIRL Jeepers . MAN I 'm sure your father is n't going to die . GIRL You are ? MAN Well , I 'm not absolutely sure , but I do n't think he 's going to die . GIRL Perhaps you 'll stay for the celebration , then . MAN Oh , I 've got to stay . GIRL I mean , as a friend , rather than a bill collector . MAN I 'm sorry , but I have my duty to do . BOY You would n't hand eleven summonses to a dying man , would you ? p. 26 MAN He may not be dying . BOY You 'd be willing to wait until we knew he was going to be all right , would n't you ? MAN I 'm required by traditional procedure to hand him the summonses as soon as I see him and he acknowledges his identity . BOY That might just be the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MAN As it is , I 've always followed a policy of patience and leniency where your father has been concerned . Another man in my place , less aware of the unusual circumstances and values involved , might resort to ruse or subterfuge in the matter of seeking him out and handing him the summonses . I have always been willing to wait for him to present himself in this room , although there is no law that says I may not go to where he is sleeping , wake him up , and hand him the summonses . BOY And there 's no law that says we 've got to open the door when you ring and let you in , either . MAN Yes , that 's true , and I have always appreciated the courtesy . As I say , I wish I had been born very rich , so that I might never need to worry about money at all , but the fact is my father was both poor and uneducated . I sometimes think it 's a wonder I managed to work my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I might very well have followed in my father 's footsteps . p. 27 BOY What were his footsteps ? MAN My father was an usher . BOY Where at ? MAN At theatres for the most part , but also at churches , for weddings and funerals . BOY That 's better than being a lawyer , is n't it ? MAN Do you really think so ? BOY Sure I do . Look at the people you get to meet . MAN He knew by name many of the greatest people of the theatre , and he saw many people married , and many others buried , working overtime , but I could n't follow in his footsteps at all . BOY Why not ? MAN He came to America in the first place so that his children might grow up in a place where it is customary for every man to try to improve the economic , social and cultural position into which he was born . It would have hurt him deeply had I been satisfied to be an usher , too . ( Chris 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daze of anxiety . Her daughter goes to her . Her son goes to her . The Lawyer gets to his feet . In a kind of helpless concern he goes to her , too . Chris 's wife comes out of it , suddenly ) p. 28 WIFE Oh , I 'm sorry ! Good Lord , he 's not dead ! I meant to say immediately that he 's  --  well , certainly not dead . GIRL Thank God . MAN I should say . WIFE It 's just that I ca n't think what to do for him . BOY Is there anything I can do ? WIFE No . I mean  --  well , the problem is to get him to come out of this crisis the way he always has . I mean to come out fighting . If he comes out and just sits down quietly , not caring about anything , not shouting and finding fault , then I 'm afraid  --  we 're all lost , especially me . BOY Is he still asleep ? WIFE That 's just the trouble . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we did , instead of raging and jumping out of bed , the way he always has , he just opened him eyes and smiled a little . GIRL What did he say ? WIFE He took my hand and kissed it , but he did n't say anything . I was sure he would argue and shout when the Doctor asked him to take some pills , but he did n't at all . He just took them . I 'm terribly worried . I think the Doctor is , too . p. 29 BOY What kind of pills ? WIFE I have n't the faintest idea . Surely something sensible . GIRL Sleeping pills ? WIFE No , we woke him up . Some other kind . GIRL Well , has he gone back to sleep ? WIFE He had n't a moment ago . ( The Doctor joins the group . He is also in a daze of anxiety and deep thought ) BOY Doctor , is there anything I can do for my father ? DOCTOR I do n't know . All I know is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't said a word . BOY What 's really the matter with him ? DOCTOR I 'm not sure , but I think he 's decided to give up the whole idea . He has that kind of look in his eye , and his relaxation is far too complete to be unimportant . GIRL You do n't mean he wants to die , do you ? DOCTOR I 'm afraid it appears so , although I hope I 'm mistaken . After all , while he is altogether like all the rest of us , at the same time he 's altogether different , too , and my interpretation of his present condition as critical , as it would be for any of us under the same circumstances , may not be critical for him at all . As I say , I just do n't know . I want to think . Now , my dear , if you feel we ought to call in somebody else , please know that I myself would prefer that . This is too much responsibility for me alone . p. 30 WIFE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two heads are better than one , three are better than two , and four  --  WIFE Do you really want somebody else to look in on him ? DOCTOR I do n't  --  of course  --  but I 'm just a little afraid of the feeling of regret I might have if I did n't  --  and he happened to die . BOY Doctor , if there 's something I can do for my father  --  anything  --  you 've got to let me know . I do n't want to just stand around on New Year 's Eve and wait for my father to die because I neglected to do something that would keep him alive . DOCTOR Of course not , but I just do n't know what I can ask you to do . It certainly would n't do for any of us to become emotional . If anything , we simply must be quite matter of fact and apparently unconcerned about the whole thing . MOTHER Yes , we must not be sorrowful . He 'd sense it immediately . He must not know we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out  --  fighting ? MOTHER No , he does n't . At any rate , he 's been perfectly satisfied just to lie there and smile . p. 31 DOCTOR It may be a phase of course . He may be getting old , that 's all . I mean , very old . It may be that just the idea is dying in him and that he himself will stay alive for many years to come . As I say , I 'm not at all sure of anything . GIRL Father 's idea dead ? Why , father would n't be anything at all without his idea . DOCTOR Precisely . Still , something of the sort happens to people every day . We see them still moving about in the streets but we know something very important died in them long ago . GIRL We do n't want that to happen to father . I think it would be better if he died entirely , rather than that . MOTHER He just is n't mad at everybody the way he 's supposed to be at this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year as long as I can remember . BOY Well , if the problem is to get him fighting mad  --  ( He looks at the Lawyer with a new perceptiveness : everybody else looks at the Lawyer with the same new recognition , while the Lawyer tries to smile shyly at so much attention )  --  If that 's the problem  --  DOCTOR And it is . BOY Here 's our man . ( He places a hand on the Lawyer 's shoulder ) p. 32 MAN I 'll be glad to do anything I can . BOY Then , hand him the eleven summonses . MAN I must do that , in any case . The minute he comes out . BOY No . You 've got to go in there , and hand him the summonses . MAN I do n't think your father 's going to like that . BOY Of course not . MAN I 've never done it that way before . BOY He 's never been this sick before , either . Do you agree , Doctor ? DOCTOR Yes , I do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal of care . MAN I do n't think I ought to go in there that way . BOY You 've got to . My father 's life 's at stake . DOCTOR Now , as it is , you 're much too  --  well , how shall I put it ? You 've put aside the customary offensiveness which goes with a job like yours . If the treatment is to be of any use at all , you 've got to be terribly offensive . MAN Nobody can be offensive on purpose . DOCTOR Of course you can . You 're a grown man . Think back to your training . A man ca n't buy things , give them away , not pay for them , and then expect to go free . p. 33 MAN ( Falling helplessly into the affected logic ) That 's quite true . DOCTOR That 's more like it . But more , much more . Who does he think he is ? A privileged character of some kind ? Does he think he has rights nobody else in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do believe he is mistaken . Laws are made for all of the people , and all of them must obey them . DOCTOR Much better , but more , still more . Just because for a week every year everybody thinks he 's the greatest man in the world and notices his greatness a hundred million times in a hundred million places does n't mean that at the end of the week he is n't exactly the same as everybody else , and answerable for his acts . MAN I must say I agree , and of course my clients have given me specific instructions to show no mercy . It 's not as if this were the first time he 's done this very same thing . DOCTOR Of course not . He does it year after year , and it seems to me it were about time law-abiding citizens such as yourself brought him to task . MAN I do n't quite know how I can disagree with the sentiments you 've expressed . DOCTOR Very well , then . There 's your briefcase , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and times . It seems to me the proper thing to do is to march in there ' and hand him the summonses . p. 34 MAN Yes , that 's my duty . ( The Boy shoves the briefcase into his hands ) DOCTOR Then , do your duty , and do it well . He ca n't get by with a thing like that . MAN I should think not . ( The Boy pushes him toward the door , and the Lawyer goes ) BOY Now , for the fireworks . GIRL Oh , will father tear him to pieces ! I almost feel sorry for the poor man . WIFE All right , children , let 's just be quiet , and listen . ( She puts her hand to her mouth , asking for silence . The four of them stand still to listen . After a moment they begin to look at one another , with mounting concern ) BOY ( Whispers ) What 's the matter ? GIRL ( Whispers ) What 's gone wrong ? DOCTOR ( Whispers ) I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I 'm going to cry . ( She does so , silently ) ( The Lawyer comes back in ) p. 35 BOY ( Whispers ) What happened ? MAN ( Also whispers ) I do n't know . He accepted every one of the summonses without protest . He said I was absolutely right . BOY ( Whispers ) Oh , no ! DOCTOR ( Whispers ) This is terribly serious ! MAN ( Looks into empty briefcase , confused , a little astonished ) I 've done my duty , so of course it 's time for me to go , but I would appreciate it very much if I might stay . WIFE ( Still making a face and sobbing silently , whispers ) Of course you may stay . BOY You were n't offensive ! MAN I tried to be . BOY That 's the trouble with you . When you try , you ca n't be offensive . When you first arrived , you were fine . It was impossible not to notice how contemptible your work has made you . MAN I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got to make him mad . p. 36 GIRL And we 've got to find out what it is . BOY And quick , too . WIFE Flies ! He 's always hated flies . They 've always infuriated him . BOY ( Running to kitchen door ) There 's always two or three in the kitchen ) ( He goes in ) WIFE ( To Girl ) He 's always hated pianola music , too . GIRL I 'll go turn it on . ( She goes ) ( After a moment the pianola is heard with I 'm Forever Blowing Bubbles . The Girl comes back into the room ) WIFE Oh , how I love that music , and how he hates it . GIRL That ought to bring him out . BOY ( Clenched fist ) Fly number one ! ( He goes to the door , opens it a little , puts his fist into the room , brings it back , shuts the door quickly and quietly , runs back to the kitchen , but on the way he does a little dance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing ) They fly so high , nearly reach the sky . p. 37 BOY ( Running , dancing ) Fly number two . ( Same procedure , and back to the kitchen ) DOCTOR ( Begins to dance with Chris 's Wife ) I shall be terribly relieved when he comes out and begins to shout . WIFE Oh , I 'm sure he will  --  now ! BOY Fly number three . A great big fat one , too . ( He dances to the door , puts the fly into the room , comes back , dancing . The door-chime is heard . He dances to the door , opens it . A man steps in ) MAN I 've been sent here by Time Magazine . I know he has always refused to be interviewed , but they told me to give it another try anyhow  --  I 'm on my way home . He wo n't be interviewed , will he ? BOY Oh , no ? ( Takes Reporter by the arm ) There 's the door . Just go in there and fire away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask him . MAN Are you sure ? ( In the meantime , two boys and two girls come in through the open door , look and listen . The smallest boy , not more than eight or nine is holding a pigeon with both hands , smiling brightly ) p. 38 BOY ( To Reporter ) He 's just like anybody else . Go on in , sit down , ask him questions . MAN Well , O.K. , if you say so . ( He goes in . The Boy smiles , believing his father will throw the Reporter out in no time ) GIRL Can we look at him ? BOY Sure . ( He rounds them up , takes them to the door , opens it , and one by one , they go in , and one by one , they come out . Chris 's Wife , Son , Daughter , the Lawyer , and the Doctor watch the parade . They are astonished that Chris has n't blown his top ) WIFE ( Almost crying again ) I ca n't understand it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DOCTOR I may say , I 'm terribly worried . WIFE What in the world 's the matter with him ? ( The pianola roll ends ) URCHIN We saw him ! URCHIN 2 He smiled at us ! URCHIN 3 We never saw him at home before . URCHIN 4 He 's the nicest man in the whole world . p. 39 WIFE Oh , this is terrible ! URCHIN 2 Can we sing a song for him ? WIFE Yes , if you like . ( The Urchins gather together in a group , including the small boy with the pigeon , and they go to work on a year-end song called Eat , Eat , Eat.As they sing , an old Beggar comes in to look and listen ; then a skinny , anxious fellow who might be a Thief  --  in fact , he can barely keep putting small objects in his pocket . At last he takes a small object and sneaks out , just as a tall grimfaced man who might be a descendant of an Indian Chief comes in and stands around looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich also comes in , accompanied by a chauffeur in uniform.Everybody joins the singing  --  as Chris 's Wife comes and goes with her daughter to and from the kitchen with plates of sandwiches , fruit and candy , and sets the stuff out  --  and everybody eats.The young man who swiped something sneaks back in , puts the swiped object back where it was , joins the singing , smiles , relaxes.The song ends . Everybody falls silent.Chris 's Wife and the Doctor , and the Boy and the Girl are deeply worried , but at the same time eager to go on with the proceedings , because they feel doing so will infuriate Chris and restore him to his usual good or ill health ) WIFE Thank you very much for that wonderful song . p. 40 URCHIN Thank you for letting us come in . WIFE Oh , now , do n't go . URCHIN We do n't want to be no bother . ( They begin to go ) Boy with Pigeon ( To Lawyer ) Want to buy a pigeon , Mister ? MAN No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Pigeon opens his hands , the Pigeon flies out , and Boy hurries out , to catch up with his friends.The Reporter comes out of the room , closes the door behind him . Chris 's Son hurries to him ) BOY What 'd he say ? REPORTER All sorts of things . BOY Did he get mad ? REPORTER Oh , no . I had no idea he would be so easy to get along with . BOY Well , what 'd you ask him ? REPORTER Well , for one thing , I asked him why he went to all the trouble every year . BOY What 'd he say ? REPORTER Said it was the consequence of never having been analyzed . GIRL Oh , no ! p. 41 BOY Did n't you see any flies in there ? REPORTER Yes , I did , as a matter of fact  --  quite a few of them . BOY Well , did he say anything about them ? REPORTER He did , and what he said was pretty much what you 'd expect him to say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little flies . Poor little despised creatures . GIRL Oh , no ! REPORTER ( To Wife ) I certainly appreciate your letting me see your husband at home . WIFE It 's quite all right . REPORTER I 'm the first reporter ever to interview him , am I not ? WIFE Yes , you are . REPORTER Thank you very much . My story will be in the next issue . I hope you 'll like it . WIFE I 'm sure we will . ( The Reporter goes . Everybody falls silent . The Boy peeks in at the door . He comes back , absolutely dejected ) DOCTOR Is he sleeping ? p. 42 BOY No , he 's just lying there with a fly sitting on his nose . DOCTOR Here 's a nickel . I wonder if you 'd go to the corner drugstore and get me a package of cough drops . BOY For father ? DOCTOR No , I 've got a slight irritation in my throat . BOY What kind of cough drops ? DOCTOR Oh , any kind  --  the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got some of those someplace right here . ( He draws open a drawer or two , finally comes out with a Smith Bros. packet of cough drops , hands it to the Doctor , the Doctor shakes one out , puts it into his mouth , hands the packet back to the Boy ) Well , I guess we 've flopped , that 's all . Now what ? RICH MAN WITH CHAUFFER Madam , I do not know what place this is or what family , but I would have to be blind not to notice a great anxiety here . Now , what 's the trouble ? MAN ( Bringing a very long document out of his briefcase ) Well , some the trouble is listed here . ( He hands the document to the Rich Man , who reads silently from it , glances at Wife , at Son , at Daughter , at Doctor , at Lawyer ) p. 43 RICH MAN WITH CHAUFFER Is this the full extent of his liabilities ? MAN I believe all the facts and figures are in the document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning pages , going back , and so on ) I see . That 's quite a sum of money . MAN Yes , it is . I 've served him with all of the summonses involved , but of course he has no money . RICH MAN WITH CHAUFFER Is that true , Madam ? WIFE Yes , I 'm afraid it is . RICH MAN WITH CHAUFFER I have accumulated over the past half century a considerable fortune , some of which I should not mind putting to work now in settling this ( He shakes the document ) unfortunate matter . MAN You mean you wish to pay his debts ? RICH MAN WITH CHAUFFER Dollar for dollar . MAN But why ? RICH MAN WITH CHAUFFER Well , I do n't know , but is n't it said that it is better to give than to receive ? MAN It is , but I never knew anybody in his right mind who ever paid much attention to that saying . p. 44 RICH MAN WITH CHAUFFER I think I may say that I am quite in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despair no more . ( To Lawyer ) Let us proceed , then . I wo n't have this lady 's husband dragged through the courts . MAN If you 'll favor my clients with the money he owes , I will pick up the summonses , and the matter will be settled . Where do you bank ? RICH MAN WITH CHAUFFER I do n't . George , the satchel , please . CHAUFFEUR Yes , sir . ( He hands the Rich Man the satchel . The Rich Man places it on the table , opens it ) RICH MAN WITH CHAUFFER ( To Lawyer ) Help yourself . MAN ( Lifts out neatly bundled stacks of crisp new currency , gives one piece of currency the works , examining it every which way ) Are they all thousands ? RICH MAN WITH CHAUFFER Hardly . If they were , I 'd scarcely have enough there to settle this matter . You 'll find tens , twenties , fifties and hundreds . MAN Hundred-thousand-dollar bills ? ! RICH MAN WITH CHAUFFER That is correct . p. 45 MAN Whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAN WITH CHAUFFER I never bothered to notice . A distinguished man , no doubt . MAN Where did you get this money ? RICH MAN WITH CHAUFFER Now , now , let 's conduct our business in a business-like manner . Begin your counting , please . MAN Well , there 's a hundred in each bundle , I presume . RICH MAN WITH CHAUFFER George , is that so ? CHAUFFEUR Yes , sir . A hundred in each bundle . MAN ( Holds bundle ) A hundred one hundred thousand dollar bills . Now , let 's see . One bundle . Two . Three . Four . Five . Six . BOY ( Suddenly shouting ) Man , look at all that crazy paper ! ( Chris , in a red robe , a big and hand some man of indeterminate years , comes into the room.Everybody is silent , waiting for the break . All he does , though , is smile  --  as if he were dying . He is gentility and kindness itself , which is precisely what he ought not to be at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do you do , sir . p. 46 CHRIS How do you do . RICH MAN WITH CHAUFFER My name is Morgan J. Pinpoint . CHRIS And mine is  --  RICH MAN WITH CHAUFFER You need n't tell me . I know . All my life I 've wanted the honor of meeting you  --  I mean , at home , this way . We met again and again over the years , but as you may remember we were in the street at the time and among the crowd , so to say  --  entirely anonymous . This is indeed a great honor . I feel deeply privileged to be able at last to pay my respects in this manner . ( He gestures idly and unimportantly at the stacks of bills spread about ) CHRIS You 're very kind . BOY ( Absolutely in despair ) Oh , no ! RICH MAN WITH CHAUFFER My pleasure . ( A police siren is heard suddenly , very near . The Rich Man and his Chauffeur are transformed from poised assured men of the world into panic-stricken , hunteddown animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( He starts tossing the bundles back into the satchel . George moves toward the front door ) The back way , George ! ( He steps up to Chris ) O Sir , I know you understand . ( Running steps are heard ) A difference of opinion , that 's all . Goodbye , sir . p. 47 CHRIS Goodbye , and good luck . ( He points to the rear door . The Rich Man strides to it , flings it open , and two men in uniform step forward . The Rich Man bounds across the room , but one of the men grabs him , while the other grabs George , the Chauffeur ) RICH MAN WITH CHAUFFER Captured again ! I might have known ! I might have known ! Unhand me , please ! Unhand me ! MAN IN UNIFORM All right , now Morgan , let 's go along quietly . RICH MAN WITH CHAUFFER Now , why must you forever stop me from spending my money ? That 's what it 's for . It 's no good in the satchel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about the money , Morgan . Time to go back , now . RICH MAN WITH CHAUFFER ( With terrible fear , almost like a child ) I do n't want to go back . MAN IN UNIFORM Of course not , but you must ! RICH MAN WITH CHAUFFER ( Almost weeping ) No , I do n't want to go back . George does n't want to go back , either . Am I right , George ? GEORGE ( Almost weeping ) Right as rain , sir . p. 48 MAN IN UNIFORM 2 Come on , come on , we have n't got all day . I 've got to get home . ( George resists ) Come on , I said . ( He pushes George ) CHRIS ( Beginning to blow up ) Just a moment , officer ! ( Everybody looks at Chris hopefully ) OFFICER 2 All right , I know , I know  --  well , we 've been taking care of people like these two for a long time , and you have n't . Sometimes you 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He pushes George again ) CHRIS ( Very slowly , very powerfully ) Do n't push that man , Officer ! Do n't push anybody ! OFFICER 2 Look , old boy , I know how to do my work , and I do n't want any instructions from you . CHRIS ( Louder ) You will take your hands off that man . OFFICER 2 Oh , I will , will I ? CHRIS ( Angrier than ever ) You are in my home , and not in your own . These men , whoever they are , are my guests , and as long as you remain here , you are my guest too , and you will behave as a human being  --  miserable , as we all are . p. 49 OFFICER 2 What 's he talking about ? OFFICER 1 Do n't ask me . ( He lets go of the Rich Man ) RICH MAN WITH CHAUFFER ( To Officer 1 ) Thank you , sir . OFFICER 1 That 's all right . ( Officer 2 lets go of George ) GEORGE Thanks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're supposed to take them back the minute we find them , but I do n't know , I guess we could say to ourselves that we did n't find them , could n't we . RICH MAN WITH CHAUFFER ( Rather soberly and even intelligently ) We only wanted to get out and celebrate the New Year , that 's all . We 'd go back by ourselves , would n't we , George ? GEORGE Yes , sir , we 'd go back . We 'd go back by ourselves , walking on our own two feet like everybody else . RICH MAN WITH CHAUFFER After all , it is our home , and it is in the world , too , the same as any other place , only on a night like this we like to go among our friends and see them again  --  the ones that have n't died yet , and the new ones that have come along since we were there last . p. 50 OFFICER 1 It 's O.K. with me if it 's O.K. with you . OFFICER 2 I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hurrying ' em back . What 's the hurry ? Unless we 're afraid they might stop being  --  ( He gestures , to indicate crazy ) RICH MAN WITH CHAUFFER I worked for a living a long time . I 'm an engraver by trade , but one time there I ran an elevator , too . I could do that again , and so could you , George . I 'd teach you how . GEORGE I could give it a try , sir . OFFICER 1 What do you say ? OFFICER 2 Well , suppose we say we just did n't catch up with ' em , that 's all . If they come back , O.K. If they run elevators , good luck to ' em . OFFICER 1 ( To Chris ) If its all right with you , sir , we 'll say good night , then . CHRIS Good night , Gentlemen . OFFICERS 1 AND 2 Good night , sir . ALL Good night . ( The Officers go ) RICH MAN WITH CHAUFFER George and I , sir , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't we , George ? p. 51 GEORGE We sure do , sir . RICH MAN WITH CHAUFFER And like our friends we 'll say good night , too . GEORGE Yes , sir , we 'll say good night , too . ( He goes toward the back door ) RICH MAN WITH CHAUFFER This way , George . ( He takes the satchel out of George 's hand and puts it on the table ) GEORGE The money , sir ! We 're not leaving the money , are we ? RICH MAN WITH CHAUFFER Yes , George . We do n't need it any more . We 'll go away . West , I guess . We 'll change our names . Back , I mean . Back to what they were in the beginning . We 'll go to work . GEORGE Yes , sir . Anything you say , sir . It 's not real money anyway , is it , sir ? RICH MAN WITH CHAUFFER Oh , it 's real enough , George  --  it 's just that it costs too much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From nickels and dimes , so that when we get a dollar , it 'll be a dollar , and we 'll know it , and know why it 's a dollar , and how it came to be a dollar . ( To Chris ) Good night , sir . Good night , Madam . CHRIS AND CHRIS 'S WIFE Good night . p. 52 CHRIS Good luck . RICH MAN WITH CHAUFFER Take care , everybody . ( They go out the front ) GIRL ( Runs and throws her arms around Chris ) Oh , father , you were wonderful ! BOY I hope to tell you he was ! CHRIS I 'm sick . I 'm sick to death of the crazy human race . Even so , even so , happy new year , everybody . Let 's get along with it , shall we ? ( He puts his arms around his Wife , the Girl runs into the adjoining room , and the pianola starts again . Chris begins to dance with his Wife , as the play ends. )    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
