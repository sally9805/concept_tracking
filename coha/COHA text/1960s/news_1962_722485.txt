txt BY HOWARD JAMES Evangelist Billy Graham warned an estimated 30,000 persons who filled McCormick Place last night that there is " something wrong with mankind , " and that the only way to right the wrong is for men to be " born again . " Man is distressed , discouraged , and unhappy , he said . Man is hounded by conscience , driven by passion , and ruled by selfishness . He is belligerent , quarrelsome , and unfriendly ; confused , depressed , and miserable . Not God 's Purpose " This is not the creature God meant us to be , " he said in his 11th sermon of the Chicago crusade . " Something has happened to man . " Christ said ' You must be born again . ' Man needs a rebirth . His nature must be changed and redirected . " His text last night was from John ** answered and said unto him , " Verily , verily , I say unto thee , except a man be born again , he can not see the Kingdom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have been bad , those who have committed serious sins , Graham said . Jesus addressed these words to a respectable man , Nicodemus , and Nicodemus was stunned , Graham , said . " Jesus did not say ' Except a bad man be born again , ' " Graham said . " Jesus said ' Except a man . ' " Meaning of Term He explained " new birth " as a man 's " turning from sin to Christ . " The word " conversion , " he said , is being used by advertisers , those in finance , and even the military . " As ' conversion ' is being used in many realms , so it is being used in the spiritual , " he said . " It simply means change . " Conversion is the voluntary changing in the mind of a man when he turns from things that are wrong in his life , and turns to Christ , Graham said . Men are too weak ' to turn without the aid of God , yet God does not override human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering the Kingdom of God with their head first , rather than with their heart , Graham said . They insist on being convinced before they are converted . " I have found that usually when a man writes a question mark over all Christ has said , it means he is dodging the truth rather than an honest attempt to discover truth , " he said . " If you waited to understand the mechanics of television , you would never tune it in , " he said . Thus , being born again becomes a " task of believing and receiving , " more than of " comprehending and doing , " he said . Example of Surgery He used the example of a man who needs surgery . The man must accept the finding of the doctor . It is not something he does himself ? he puts his trust in the surgeon . " You can experience this tremendous change by the simple act of repentance and faith in Jesus Christ , " he said . Today 's meeting in McCormick Place at 3 p. m . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30,000 persons was estimated by Victor Hofer , operation director of McCormick Place . Crusade officials said 375 persons responded to Graham 's call to " make decisions for Christ . "
