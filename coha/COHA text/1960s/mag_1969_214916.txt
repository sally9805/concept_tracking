More student riots = fewer alumni gifts . ( ) True ( ) False <P> College fund raisers have been groping for the right answer all year . While private campuses have never been so in need of alumni cash , alumni have never been so angry at protesters . By last week , enough checks had come in so that fund raisers finally knew which box to check . At most campuses , the donation trend is surprisingly upward . There are fewer gifts , but the sums are bigger than ever . <P> Most alumni seem to feel that alma mater 's crisis is a time for loyalty , not desertion . Even long-indifferent alumni have renewed their interest and their giving . Astute presidents foster this new involvement with frequent explanatory letters to alumni and parents . After a sit-in at the University of Pennsylvania , for example , President Gaylord Harn-well sent a communique stressing that the protesters had obeyed Penn 's rules for demonstrations . Back came many letters of support and $5,000 in unsolicited contributions . <P> Vote of Confidence . Troubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A preliminary accounting showed that Harvard College had received a new high of $3.4 million-$87 , - 000 more than last year . Dartmouth 's 50th-reunion class ( ' 19 ) produced what is expected to be a record sum for the class . Fund Chairman Richard Lombard also reported a " financial vote of confidence " by some Dartmouth men who had refused to contribute for as long as five years . Denver University 's Chan cellor Maurice Mitchell , who expelled 39 sit-in demonstrators last year , recently inspired a torrent of admiring letters-and donations-when he vowed to ignore further student threats . Denver 's average alumni gift increased from $30 to $46.77 , while overall donations rose by 133% . <P> There were gripes , too , some of them scrawled angrily on the pledge cards mailed out by hopeful fund raisers . Many postage-paid envelopes came back containing news pictures of the gun-toting black students at Cornell-and no checks . The kind of alumni ire once generated by losing football teams is now created by winning rioters . One grad wrote anonymously in answer to a plea from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . " This was doubly wounding to Temple , where a one-day sit-in had won nothing . <P> Not all Penn alumni were impressed by President Harnwell 's pitch . Still irked at the Penn sit-in , one man declared : " For the time being I am putting the university on probation and withholding my annual contribution . " A Harvard graduate of 1944 was even more bitter . After the spring disorders in Cambridge , he wrote to his class-gift chairman demanding his money back .
