txt They sit in a corner by the unused dart board at the Red Cow , sipping mild beer and talking in a strange language . Some wear colorful flowing robes and II turbans , others workers ' clothes . One arrived from the Punjab in 1952 , but most of the others in the group from India immi , grated four or five years ago . A young Jamaican sits by himself within earshot of the Indians , not understanding a , word they- say . He looks uncomfortable . There are whites at another lend of the long , brightly lit barroom . There are far fewer id them than there used to be , and they are mainly the young . A bartender observes that as the Indians and Jamaicans have come to the Red Cow , so the others have moved to the private clubs in town , which exclude nonwhites , Most Britons consider Indians and Pakistanis colored . " I have nothing against the colored people personally , " says Eric Chadwick , a house painter , drawing a roll-your-own cigarette across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them around me. " - . " It has n't hurt business , " Says the bald-headed proPrietor- ' of the Red Cow ; ' " A colored man 's : shilling is as " good as a white man 's . " The Red Cow is one of the biggest pubs in . Smethwick , a drab , smoky , ' industrial suburb of Birmingham , where James Watt designed steam engines nearly 200 years ago . For more than a . century : : this region of the Midlands has been known as the " Black Country " because of its pan of smoke . Today this community of 68 , - 510 inhabitants , with 5,000 to 6,000 " immigrants "  --  the polite word for the dark-skinned Pakistanis , Indians and Jamaicans ? has acquired renown as one of about 20 constituencies in Britain where a " white backlash " . could alter the general election result . ' There- are 630 constituencies in all . One of the contestants is Patrick Gordon Walker , the urbane Labor spokesman on foreign affairs and the probable Foreign Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministers run in " safe " constituencies . But because of the immigrant question , Smethwick is generally considered no longer safe for Labor . Conservative-Ruled Town Mr. Gordon Walker has been the Member of Parliament from here since 1945 . He won by a majority of 3,544 votes , or 9.4 per cent , in 1959 , but his majority has been declining since 1945 . Last May , Conservatives won control of the Town Council . Smethwick is a working-class town . A steel mill , iron foundry , an auto engine works and a brewery are the big employers . People work hard and go to bed early , go for a drive in a new car on Sunday , " go to the pictures " or the working men 's club at night , or simply watch the " telly . " The workers fear some of their newly won gains are jeopardized by the influx of people with lower standards of living . With immigrants making up nearly 10 per cent of the population , Smethwick has probably the highest proportion of darkskinned people of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is less than 2 per cent . Some SMethwicklans blame Mr. Gordon Walker for the immigrant problem . He calls such talk the " big lie " and tries to refute it whenever possible . A walk with Mr. Gordon Walker up Bowden Street , a virtually solid working-class street " bringn evidence of his difficulties as some people come to the door and tell the shadow foreign secretary that they do Riot know how they will vote Oct. 15 . Close Race Is Foreseen Things are looking better for the Labor candidate than they were , but nearly everyone figures it will be a close race . Labor says the Conservative candidate has been helping fan the flames of white discontent . Alderman Peter Griffiths , the 36-year-old Conservative candidate and headmaster at a - primary school hete , wrote last July 3 in the Conservative-leaning local paper , The Smethwick Telephone , that " Smethwick rejects the idea of being a multiracial society . " In another article July 31 , he wrote that if more houses are built they should go to the British first . Prime Minister Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statements by Mr. Griffiths . Of the statement about rejection of a multiracial society , Sir Alec said : " Every Conservative candidate and certainly every member of the Government and of the Conservative party would reject any feeling of racial discrimination , and we should not indulge . in this kind of statement . " Last March the slogan " If you want a nigger neighbor , vote Labor " . appeared on walls in the town . Now , according to the wife of a Labor canvasser , the slogan is sung by children in the street . , Mr. Griffiths is reluctant to'be drawn out on the racial question . He denies that any pressure has come from the Conservative Central Office in London . There is little doubt , though , that the racial issue is embarrassing the Prime Minister , who talks frequently about the spirit of Commonwealth cooperation . " Patrick Gordon Walker says there are two things worth voting for , " a poster says . These , it adds , are : " To defend - our town 's good name . To enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tweed suit with a vest , lights his pipe and says that the Conservative effort to capitalize on the racial question is backfiring . There is a rumor In town that Mr. Gordon Walker 's daughter married a black man , another that he had sold his house to a colored family . Why is a Labor candidate of Mr. Gordon Walker 's stature having such trouble ? Two years ago the Conservative Government imposed controls on Commonwealth immigration . Labor , under the late Hugh Gaitskill , fought the measure on ground that it not only discriminated against nonwhites but that it also represented repudiation of the once proudly held principle of free movement within the Commonwealth . Since then , Labor has come around to the Conservative view that there must be immigration controls . But in parts of the Midlands such as ' Smethwick and elsewhere in the Birmingham area , and in such sections of London as North Kensington , Brixton and Southall , working class whites who saw immigrants move next door associated Labor with their new neighbors.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
