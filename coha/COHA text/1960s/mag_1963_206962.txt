RESEARCH &; DISCOVERY <P> In scholarly off-hour bull sessions at M.I.T. 's faculty club , the clique of young research metallurgists pondered again and again one of metallurgy 's most challenging riddles . Ever since the first can appeared 150 years ago , manufacturers have had to follow a costly and complicated twelve-step process of rolling tinplate or aluminum , then punching , curling and welding a three-piece can . Why could n't the can , the Cambridge group asked itself , be blown from molten metal just as glass blowers shape bottles , or children blow soap bubbles ? <P> Light Sockets &; Square Cans . Molten aluminum , with which the metallurgists worked , behaves badly and unpredictably when combined with gases and other elements . But the M.I.T. group , forming their own company , kept at the problem . Finally they hit upon a revolutionary process that will produce a seamless aluminum can that is not only stronger than welded cans but also cheaper to produce . Now too busy for faculty club bull sessions , the researchers and their Ilikon Corp . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a promising toehold in the $800 million-a-year can market . <P> Ilikon lowers a die to the surface of a molten aluminum bath , uses a gas mixture under one-tenth-of-a-second pressure to shoot a stream of liquid aluminum into the die . When the die is raised and cooled , a seamless can drops out . This process , highly secret while patents are being gathered , has already been contracted to American Can Co . Canco will use it to produce cans for frozen citrus costing about $32 a thousand , two-thirds the old price of aluminum cans and below the price of competing tinplate . Ilikon will receive 7% of Canco 's net sales of the new cans , also retains the right to license other kinds of blown aluminum to other manufacturers . " We can make Christmas tree decorations or hubcaps or light sockets , " predicts young ( 32 ) , handsome Ili-kon President Laszlo Bonis . " We can make square beer cans that pack without any waste space . We can make cans in the trademark of something like the Coca-Cola bottle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years ago by Bonis , who fled a university post in Hungary after the 1956 revolt , and two other metallurgists . The company , now headed by Bonis , gradually assembled a 30-man staff , moved into a building in the Natick , Mass. , industrial center outside Boston . From an initial $5,000 in contracts , Ilikon expects to build sales up to $1,000,000 this year . The company has already developed thermal history gauges that can read and record temperatures in jet engines and self-lubricating alloys which will be used in space projects where ordinary lubricants disappear . But from now on , whatever its other accomplishments . Ilikon is apt to be known principally as the pioneer that solved the riddle of creating the first blown-up can .
