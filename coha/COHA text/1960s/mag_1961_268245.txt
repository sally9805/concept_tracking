The Pleasure of His Company ( Paramount ) is requested at the wedding of Miss Debbie Reynolds to Mr. Tab Hunter at Grace Cathedral , Nob Hill , San Francisco . Because the requested company is that of debonair Fred Astaire , playboy father of the bride , there is bound to be some bounce . And with Lilli Palmer , Fred 's ex-wife and the bride 's mother , handling the arrangements , one can expect grace and polish . But otherwise , it is a Nytol nuptial . Where the 1958 Broadway play ( by Samuel Taylor " with " Cornelia Otis Skinner ) set in motion a sea of social-comedy soap bubbles-light , radiant and pleasantly airy-and kept them afloat , the film merely brains its audience with broad gags . <P> Astaire sneers delectably at a photograph of Tab in a football suit , sniffs at the gaudy ties of Lilli 's current husband , Gary Merrill , and even changes the weight regulator on the man 's Exercycle . What 's worse , charming rakehell that he is ( though never as arch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he tries to freeze Tab out and lure his daughter away with promised trips to Venice , Positano and the Aegean Isle where Rupert Brooke is buried . At one painful moment , father and daughter , after a gay , French-talking night on the town , even do the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet . <P> Thus , what might otherwise have been a lightheaded comedy of manners has undertones of incest and overtones of Andy Hardy . Still , the Bay Area scenery is silken , the sets and costumes effulgent ; and at long last , a Hollywood production designer has learned something about the true-life tastes of the tasteful rich . Everybody is beautiful , worldly and fairly damned-everybody , that is , except Actress Reynolds , who , after ten years in pictures and a highly publicized scandal-divorce , is still playing the head pompom girl of Beverly Hills High .
