In any other week but one in which the U.S. and Russia were in lethal confrontation , the eyes of the world would have been on the Himalayas-where the two Asian giants are locked in momentous war . <P> The battles at either end of the 2,500-mile mountain border between India and Red China marked the end of three years of skirmishing and wordy debate about just where the frontier lies . They also marked the beginning of the end of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru 's incredible naivete about the nature of his enemy . At 72 , Nehru was getting a lesson in Communist tactics that most responsible statesmen learned long ago . Glaringly , Nehru 's policy of appeasing the Reds was exposed as bankrupt in the bloodied snow of the mountain battleground . But Nehru was still insisting that India can not give up its " basic principles " of nonalignment just because of " the present difficulty . " <P> The present difficulty was that Indian troops were being driven back by the determined , well-armed Chinese , with heavy losses at every point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wastes of Ladakh , in Kashmir , the invading Chinese overran Indian outposts , and Indian troops struggled to set up a second line of defense . It was even worse in the North East Frontier Agency at the other end of the border , where the fighting takes place in a region that has changed little since a 17th century Indian explorer described it as " another world , whose frightful roads are like paths leading to death . The great forests that clothe its hills are full of violence , like the hearts of the ignorant . " <P> The Chinese invaders poured through the mountain passes in a three-pronged drive aimed at the monastery village of Towang , which stands upon a 9,000-ft. height guarding the green valley of the Brahmaputra River . A 3,000-man Indian brigade was virtually wiped out , and an exhausted survivor said that the successive waves of Chinese troops " were like ants-they extended as far as the eye could see . " At nearby Ndhola , the Indians fought until they ran out of ammunition and then retreated through the mountains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Two fresh Indian brigades , supported by mountain artillery and heavy mortars , were rushed to reenforce Towang . Their convoy was still bouncing up the rutted Jeep path from Tezpur when they discovered that they were too late . Towang fell to the Chinese " after bitter fighting , " but its Indian defenders , said a government spokesman , " withdrew according to plan . " The Indian defense was further crippled by the absence of the border commander , Lieut . General B. M. Kaul , who reluctantly allowed himself to be evacuated after a bout of pneumonia .
