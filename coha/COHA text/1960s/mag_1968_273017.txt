Integration has been the aim of the Congress of Racial Equality since CORE was born in 1942 . Its intramural squabbles have never been concerned with the principle of desegration but with its pace . Two years ago , Floyd McKissick replaced Founder James Farmer because he was not moving fast enough . Last week McKissick , in turn , was supplanted by a more aggressive lieutenant . CORE 's new chief , however , advocates rigid separation of the races . <P> Roy Innis , a Harlem-honed black nationalist , will formally replace McKissick next month at CORE 's convention in Columbus . Innis , 34 , is a bearded manifesto maker who holds that " separation of unlikes is the natural condition of society , " and says that blacks generally favor nonviolence , but " not over the achievement of nationalistic objectives . " He professes a fear of genocide , not " by the gas chamber but by the slow taking away of our existence " through racial amalgamation . Appealing to Negroes to improve their own lot rather than die in all-out conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We believe that if we must die , it will not be by hara-kiri but by kamikaze-take as many with us as we can . " <P> By accepting Innis ' incendiary view , CORE alienates not only whites but black moderates as well . Thus it joins the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in a militant shift to the left .
