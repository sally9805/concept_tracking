Forsaking wrestling , homespun comedy , and a war movie on other channels , perhaps as many as 1,000,000 New Yorkers-an impressive 8.1 Nielsen rating-turned one evening last week to a political telecast that combined all three . After ten days of negotiations between staffs , Democratic Incumbent Robert F. Wagner and Republican Challenger Louis J. Lefkowitz met dais to dais in their campaign for mayor of New York . <P> Most New Yorkers have long since given up hope of ever having a ready effective city government ; in the Wagner-Lefkowitz debate they neither expected nor got a serious discussion of municipal problems . But if the purpose of the debate was to project personalities , it was a considerable success . Manhattan-born Bob Wagner came across as a bland , coolly confident politician of the collar-pin set . <P> State Attorney General Lefkowitz* appeared as an earnest candidate with a machine-gun style of indignant speech . Wagner , who won his primary victory last September by denouncing New York City 's Democratic bosses , now aimed at pinning the boss tag on Lefkowitz . Republican Lefkowitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it clear he thought Wagner was a bum . <P> So he came out swinging . Cried Lefkowitz of Wagner : ' ' He 's not positive . He 's known all over , by even those who work close with him at city hall , as a man who delays , puts matters over and procrastinates ... He asks you to give him four years to clean up a mess which he created for eight years . " Retorted Wagner : " Since our victory in the primaries , there can not be any boss influence at all even in the lower levels . I 'm afraid my Republican opponent ca n't say that because he 's a boss-picked candidate . " Wagner charged that Lefkowitz had been selected in " a smoke-filled room " by Republican Governor Nelson Rockefeller . Replied Lefkowitz : " You could n't get Governor Rockefeller in a smoke-filled room if you stood on your head . He does n't smoke , and he hates smoke . " <P> Bob Wagner , whose eight-year administration as mayor has been studded by scandal , shrugged off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence at a Brooklyn luncheon ( TIME , Oct. 6 ) at which contractors doing city business pledged contributions to his campaign chest . Said he : " I did not know what type of luncheon I was going to . I knew very few of the people there . We did not accept the money . " He shrugged off a charge that schools were crumbling . " The board of education is autonomous , and the one authority over the board is the state commissioner of education . " <P> During most of the evening , Wagner 's calm , slightly amused manner appeared to good advantage . But Lower East Sider Lefkowitz evened the score with a closing speech that approached eloquence . " Give me a chance , " he cried . " I love this town . I love this city . I love every borough in it . I want a chance to prove to people that no matter how big the city is , no matter how complex its problems are , I 'll find the necessary talent , men and women to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do things by letting them fester.
