texts , and the nature of its states and cultures is shown in all its chronological and environmental complexities , the picture of Africa as the " mother of monsters , " the progenitor of a special breed of inferior people , which has dominated the white world at least since medieval times , will be slowly but surely destroyed . The effect of this on the achievement of harmonious race relations is obvious . Furthermore , research in depth into African history  --  which means , of course , not only the study of those current ' favorites , political and economic history , but also of the cultural past of Africa in its widest sense ? may well reveal a special contribution of its peoples to the history of mankind . Africa will at last be brought within the bounds of what Hegel called " uni-. versal history , " admission to which has been so long denied her , not only to the detriment of Africa but of those who have been responsible for the denial . The new study of African history , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one believes that the study of history is its own justification , the new wave of scholarship will need no additional commendation ? though there is needed , perhaps , a word of warning against the inevitable band-wagoners who have sprung up in its midst . ? When the current demand for bibliographies , hastily assembled collections of too readily available documents , surveys , digests , and rapidly produced synopses has been satiated , the fashionable historian is likely to find that the conditions of the new scramble are too much for him . The difficulties of serious work on African history are too profound for the fair-weather sailors of scholarship . Like the participants in the first Scramble for Africa , they will find that it is one thing to grab a piece of territory but another to develop it , THE fundamental difficulty of African history is that of sources . Before the coming of the European conquerors , most African peoples south of the Sahara  --  and in many instances in the desert itself and even on the northern shores  --  had no script for their languages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some exceptions in Arabic ) for this period . : Under these arduousconditions , a number of alternative tech ? niques for dating and delineating African history have been developed : linguistic analysis , the collection of oral traditions , elaboration of standard archaeological methods , the analysis of blood , groups , the examination of crop distribution , and the study of African art . A convenient guide to the latest uses of most of these techniques is to be found in the report of the Third Conference on African History and Archae- ' ology ( London University , 1961 ) , which forms a complete issue of the Journal of African History ( III , 2 , 1962 ) . Even in the period after the European conquest of Africa , there are serious problems of sources . Until the habit and the facilities for writing had been developed among an African elite , most . of the records of the desperately complicated process by which the indigenous peoples of the continent were forced into fresh states and introduced to the new worlds of industrialism , nationalism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' administrators , missionaries , traders and engineers . The African viewpoint , therefore , can not be readily identified for the first half-century at least of , the European partition of Africa . And even when the technique of , writing had spread to Africans , it is difficult to find adeqUiate records for the history of such . essential elements in the story of modern Africa as the rise of nationalism , the development of an African middle class and the growth of a labor movement . Many of them have been lost or destroyed in the highly nonacademic process of creating African political parties . What records do survive of these important forms of African self-expression are often disappointing for the historian , because so intense have been the practical difficulties of establishing political parties , trade unions Or businesses that the . Africans involved in them have had little time to , de7. velop  --  orderly habits of saving their records for the independent African archives of the future . And in the archives already in existence , the rePositories of the colonial powers , many essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records are the work of those old enemies of preservation in Africa , climate , white ants and lassitude ; some were made deliberately by partisan curators . ? ? YET , in spite of all these problerns at all levels- of the - time- scale , what is remarkable is not what records have been lost but what survive . To discover these , however , often requires a persistence akin to that of the explorers of the dark , est days . of the Dark Continent . Just as these explorers  --  even the Livingstones , the most self-sufficient of them  --  could not ' advance without an elaborate network of assistance from many quarters , it is becoming increasingly clear that the writing of African history depends on the collaboration of many scholars and specialists , not all of whom will be ? professional historians . This is obvious for the ' early days of Africa , as the use of radioactive carbon dating techniques illustrates . It ' seems equally necessary for the nineteenth ? and              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
