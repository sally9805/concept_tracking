 | Who Killed Les Wilson ? @# SILENTLY THE murderer crept across the porch of the house in Crestview , Fla. , and raised his shotgun to the glass pane in the door . It wass 8:05 on the night of March 15 , 1940 .. Six feet away sat Les Wilson , father of six children and leading candidate in the Okaloosa County Sheriff 's race . He was listening to radio . Across the room sat his wife , Bama , and her father . In an adjoining bedroom was 12-year-old Ray . The murderer fired . With the roar of the gun , Ray into the living room to see a terrible thing : his father 's shattered body lying on the floor . Later that night , in a cousin 's house , the boy lay awake , crying and shaking ? and making plans . He promised himself that someday he would do what his father would have done : clean up Okaloosa County . That night young Ray Wilson began running for county sheriff . Located in the northwest corner of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Crestview its seat , was notoriously rotten . Slot machines were displayed in many ordinary places of business ; nearly every bar , beer joint and pool hall boasted a gambling room . Illegal whiskey was openly made and sold . The machine that ruled these operations 93  | largely controlled the law . Thugs beat up citizens on the street . Each year murders and mysterious disappearances went unsolved . Why did n't the law-abiding people of the community do something about it ? A leading Crestview businessman says , " There was fear here . If you sounded off against the machine you were picked up and brought in to see one of the leaders . He looked you in the eye and put his hand on the butt of his gun and told you not to cause any trouble . You damn well did n't . " Ray 's father had been the exception . A small , bespectacled man , Les Wilson did cause trouble . He despised the gamblers and the thugs , and everyone knew where he stood . In the early 1930 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed out of his jurisdiction . The crooks hated him , but his belief in the law won him a multitude of friends . Scores of men and women remember , even today , favors he did for them . Les operated a taxi business , and when people were sick he brought them food and medicine and drove them to doctors , refusing payment . In 1940 when Les Wilson announced his intention to run for sheriff , most people conceded that his victory was inevitable . Soon rumors began to spread that he would never live to take office . One warning came to his brother , Fox Wilson . " Two weeks before the murder a fellow I knew walked up behind me on the street and whispered , jell your brother they 're fixing to kill him , ' " Fox recalls . " I told Le about it and asked him if he didn ' think he should drop out of the rac and move away . He thought for while and said , No , this is my horn I'il live and die here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year-old Ray could n't get the tear out of his eyes . At night his mothe sat in the darkened living room , cry ing to herself . " And all I could do , ' Ray recollects , " was wait for the tim when I would be old enough to rui for sheriff . " While Ray was growing up , Fo Wilson searched for clues leading t the murderer . Most of the scant evidence , including empty shotgu shells and wadding , mysterious ) disappeared . In October 1940 , Gov Fred P. Cone had sent an investigat ing team to gather evidence . But i achieved nothing . In 1949 Gov . Ful ler Warren decided that the case wa hopeless ; no more of the state ' money would be spent on it . But Fox could never stop thinkin about the case . He often awoke Ra in the night to drive with him to corner of the county where , he ha heard , a man " knew something . " After graduation from high school in 1946 Ray went into the Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to Crestview , worked a year for a dry cleaner , then moved to Port St. Joe , where he took a job in a paper mill . When he married his wife , Virginia , in 1950 he told her that his decision to run for sheriff someday was part of their marriage vow .  | Intelligent and hard-working , Ray advanced rapidly in the paper company . He could look forward to a good , secure life for himself and his family . " But he was n't content , " Virginia says . " Nearly every week-end we drove 148 miles to Crestview . Finally , I told Ray , You 'd better tell your manager that we 're going hack i ? Crestview . You wo n't be happy until you run for sheriff . ' " They settled in Crestview with i heir child in 1953 . Borrowing money , Ray went into a dry-cleaning business and built up the most successful one in the area . Early in 1956 Ray figured the time had come to run for sheriff . To the onsternation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raise the money for his campaign . At the outset not a single politician , civic leader or important businessman supported him . For two months he campaigned from early morning till late at night . His platform was based on efficient , imparitial law enforcement . He made no public issue of his father 's murder . As Ray gathered voting strength his family and friends worried about him . Several times he was warned to " watch his step . " He was offered $10,000 to quit the race . In the first Democratic primary , Ray and the incumbent sheriff caplured the most votes . Then people began to abandon their fear and announce openly that they were voting or Wilson . In the second primary ? a run-off between the two leaders ? Ray won a crushing victory , taking 33 of 36 precincts . At 28 he be- came the youngest sheriff in Florida . He immediately started to clean up the county . His policy was simple : if you broke the law , you were going to be arrested . The night before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the county . Several gamblers and moonshiners tried offering him bribes ? then quickly folded their operations . For six months Ray worked furiously , reorganizing the ten-man sheriff 's department , jerking out every slot machine , shoving the thugs out of the county and setting a record for the destruction of illegal stills . The once-infamous county became as law-abiding as any in the state . Then Ray turned to the question he , his family and the people of the county had long wanted answered : Who killed Les Wilson ? Finding the answer loomed as a big task . Ray 's job as sheriff came first . Although the hunt was official business , it would have to be conducted during nights and weekends . Ray asked Walter R. Steinsiek , Jr. , superintendent of identification at the nearby Pensacola police department , to help him . " It looked hopeless to me , " Steinsiek says . " Seventeen years had passed . But Ray had a hunch that time had made the killer feel secure and that he was still around . He convinced me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ files on the case . They checked out and discounted all the previous rumors and leads . For months  | Ray searched in vain . Then he picked up a trail that led toward Jesse and Doyle Cayson , brothers whom Ray had known since his boyhood . Significantly , Ray found that soon after the murder both men had become more prosperous ; the suspicion that they had been the hirelings of the machine was strong . But frustration followed frustration in Ray 's search for the necessary proof . He and Steinsiek drove 9000 miles in six months , seeking witnesses . Many were afraid to talk ; others knew nothing . By July 1957 , Steinsiek felt they had reached a dead end . " We had talked to more than too people , " he said , " and we still did n't have enough evidence for an indictment . " Ray refused to give up . While he searched for evidence he saw the Cayson brothers frequently , but he never betrayed his feelings or changed his attitude toward them . " I felt sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , but trying not to show it , " Ray says . " I was n't afraid of their taking off . Running away would have been the same as a confession . " The first hopeful piece of information concerned a woman named Mattie , who allegedly had been close to the murderers . She had vanished shortly after the murder , but Ray and Steinsiek managed to get the address of her mother . Through her , they learned that Manic had twice changed her name and now lived in San Antonio , Texas . When Ray and Steinsiek confronted Mattie , she refused to testify , " I 'm afraid , " she said . " I 'll get into terrible trouble . " She said that she had been with Jesse Cayson in a cafe about half an hour before the mur der , and that Doyle had rushed in , saying , " The plans have been changed . Come on . We 're doing the job tonight . " She saw them leave with shotguns . Afterward she was ferociously beaten with a tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few years later , while driving , she and her husband were fired on . Sete left Crestview and tried to disappear . Ray appealed to her . " With your testimony we can bring my father 's killers to trial . I 'll protect you . " She finally agreed . " I 'll testify . I 'm scared , but I 've been waiting all these years to clear my mind of what happened that night . " They tracked down another essential witness , a woman who shoal after the murder had heard Jess Cayson admit that he had told several people he shot Les Wilson And when he was asked whether he had , he broke into tears of remorse and could not answer . They located ? after a full year ' search ? the switchboard operato who , it was rumored , had recognize the voice and overheard the questions of one of the suspects when h telephoned a cafe near the taxi star to find out if Les was driving taxi that night . She agreed to testify In all , they located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During the investigation several  | men approached Ray and asked pointedly if he was n't afraid of a repetition of what had happened to his father . To avoid an attack , Ray let it be known that copies of the information and evidence were filed in several places . In June 1958 , after 18 months of work , 20,000 miles of travel and interrogation of more than 200 persons , Ray appeared before a grand jury in Crestview courthouse and said , " I 'd like to present evidence in he murder of Les Wilson . " In secret meetings the grand jury heard Ray , Steinsiek and more than a score of witnesses . They considered the case for two weeks , then ordered the two Gaysons to stand trial . In November the accused were found guilty of firstdegree murder . In answer to their appeals , the Florida Appellate Court in February and the Florida Su preme Court in April 1960 upheld the conviction . " It 's over , " Ray said .
