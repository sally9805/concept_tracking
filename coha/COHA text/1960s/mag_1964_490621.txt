Notes and Comment IT is our fervent hope that the New York State Legislature will find time , before the end of its current deliberations , to undo and make speedy amends for the ghastly clinker it hit the other day when it passed a bill renaming the New York State Thruway . As matters now stand , the state 's longest highway will go scraping down the blackboards of time under the title of the Thomas E. Dewey Thruway  --  a prospect that seems certain to engrave a permanent wince in the expression and posture of millions of future motorists . The idea of honoring our state 's former Governor and Presidential candidate gave the legislators a rare opportunity to do away , once and for all , with the old , abominably underlettered stridulence of " Thruway . " Instead , they compounded the trouble by marrying the baggage to an impossible rhyme . Ever since we read the news , we have been muttering the new handle to ourself , and the best we can conic up with is " The Thomas E. Dewey Threwey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The thing is impossible , and we predict for it the same stubborn non-recognition that our fellow-townspeople have granted an earlier unpleasant mouthful , " The Avenue of the Americas . " Lawmakers like nothing hettcr than the bestowing of honorific monickers on public works they have voted , and the future , alas , holds promise of more and more multi-lane highways slicing our landscape . If the legislative ear retains its present content of tin , we shall soon be staring at signs directing us to the Keating Kauseway , the Lehman Frehway , the Harriman Hiway , and perhaps even the Goldwater Goway . Helpfulness , not petulance , is our hyword , however , and we have put in a good many hours with metronome and pencil this week trying out happier substitutes to wire to Albany before the sign painters get to work on the Thruway . Our solution is a new title that is both respectable and mellifluous : the Thomas E. Dewey Turnpike . What we like best about it , aside from its spelling , is the fact that it will almost certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pike , which is practically Elizabethan in its simplicity and rustic charm . The Dewey Pike ! Why , it 's a folk song ! Already we can hear Peter , Pau , and Mary tuning up : Dolly WE decided , the other day , to have a chat with Miss Carol Channing about the way things have been going since she made such a hit in " Hello , Dolly ! " " What I 'd like you to do is to tour around in my limousine , " she told us when we got her on the phone . " I rent it , and I use it in all my free time . It has a telephone , and maybe hot and cold running water , and a wonderful driver named Bob . " Miss Channing picked us up in her limousine , gave us one of her expansive smiles , rolled her big brown eyes , brimming with credulity , and reached out for a red phone on a ledge in the rear of the limousine to call her optical author ity  --  Albert Davis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she told us that she usually wears one contact lens . " If I keep it too long in one eye , the other gets antagonistic , so I switch it back and forth , " she said . While we were reflecting on Miss Channing 's ocular shenanigans , we were also able to take an appreciative look at her costume . She was arrayed in a gray stocking hat , a black fur coat that came to her waist , a gray sweater , gray leotard tights , gray gauntlets , and gray boots . We asked if her abbreviated coat was seal . " It 's dyed mink , " she said . " Actually , I 'm mad for gray . " At this point , Miss Channing 's limousine pulled up before Mr. Davis 's establishment , where Miss Channing had a seance with a pretty Eurasian girl who was determined to fit her with becoming spectacle frames . " What I want is something very wild and aseptic , " said Miss Channing . While we sat and watched , she tried on a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly , and then suggested that what she really wanted was a gray frame with the eyepieces set very wide apart . The Davis girl said they 'd get right around to that . The two of us then repaired to the limousine , and Miss Channing phoned Sally Victor 's hat shop , on East Fifty-third Street . On our way to Miss Victor 's , Miss Channing told us that she is the daughter of a celebrated Christian Science lecturer , George Channing , who was once a reader in the Fifth Church in San Francisco . She herself is a Christian Scientist , she added , and so is her son , Charming Lowe , who is ten years old , but her husband , Charles F. Lowe , a television producer and writer , is of the Presbyterian persuasion , more or less . " My husband feels that all religions should have a fair deal , " she said . The phone rang , and Miss Charming answered it , to learn that young Channing , who attends the Allen-Stevenson School , had received some splendid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get some hard candy , " she told the driver , and then inquired of us , " Do you like hard candy We said we could take it or leave it . " When I was at Bennington ... " she began , and drifted into a silence that was interrupted by a phone call to her wigmaker , Ira Senz , on Fifth Avenue . " My wig oxidizes in the light , " Miss Channing told us after she had talked with Mr. Senz . We nodded vaguely and asked Miss Channing why she , a San Francisco girl , had gone to Bennington . " I had hoped to be in drama and dance , and Bennington had the likes of Jose Limon and Martha Graham , " she said . " But it was n't till I went back to California that I had a chance to audition , with Marge Champion , for ' Lend an Ear , ' which really got me going . Since then , I 've played other shows and club dates , but it 's nice to be hack with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine auditioner back home . " The car had now arrived at Sally Victor 's , and Miss Charming darted in to pick up a couple of hats . On her return , she called Barton 's about the hard candy , discovered that the shop was going to shut down early in the afternoon , appeared dismayed , and instructed Bob to go swiftly to the wigmaker 's . " It 's hard to find any really substantial wigs nowadays , " she told us . " I remember reading about women selling their hair , and even their teeth , in the old days . But right now we 're practically down to yak hair , which I imagine would be tough to dye into the flaming red I use in ' Hello , Dolly ! ' Also , I 'd be rather squeamish about wearing yak hair .

" Goodbye and Hello WE went down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other evening to take part in a feast celebrating the arrival of the Chinese New Year . The proprietors of The Lichee Tree , General and Mme. Chi-Chih Kuo , who are old friends of ours , greeted us at the door . The General looked very benign for a man who had once been a warrior in the Nationalist Army , and Mme. Kuo looked very splendid in a shimmering black sequin chang-span " Happy New Year ! " they said in unison , and the General handed us a small card on which a row of Chinese characters was inscribed . " This says , ' New Year 's Day , open , brush , brush , top , grows , flower , flower , middle , bear , fruit , certainly , as , you , wish , ' " the General informed us . " I give you literal translation of each character . It is traditional New Year 's greeting . " " Now we say goodbye to the rabbit and hello to the dragon , " said Mme. Kuo . " Tonight we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to a small table in front of a dais , on which stood a very large table , covered by a lovely red silk cloth shot through with gold and silver threads . On the large table were bowls of pomegranates and lotus seeds , which , Mme. Kuo told us , are excellent things to have around  --  pomegranates particularly , since they represent the essence of life . When she had gone off to see to the needs of her other guests , we set about putting away some Shrimp Medallion , Shu Mei , Curry Crab in Cellophane ( which sounded somewhat non-traditional to us ) , Bong Bong Chicken , and Imperial Ho Go Soup . Between courses , we were entertained by Helen Liu , a prize-winning classic painter from Taiwan , who picked up a piece of bamboo paper and drew a fish  --  which Mme. Kuo , acting as mistress of ceremonies , described as a most harmonious creature  --  and by Kalen Liu , her sister , whom Mme. Kuo introduced as Formosa 's newest singing and dancing star . Both young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paces with charm and dexterity . While we were in the middle of our Imperial Ho Go , we were joined by the artist Dong Kingman , another old friend of ours . " I think I do some drawing here tonight , " he said . " You know , everybody says ' Happy New Year , ' but in China we say Gunn hay fat ahoy , ' which means ' Wish you make a lot of money . ' " Mr. Kingman was accompanied by a nephew , whom he introduced as Willie Tsang a round-faced youth of , we estimated , about seventeen summers . Willie ordered a Scotch-andsoda , and we asked Mr. Kingman if the lad was n't a bit young to he indulging in spirits . " Willie is thirty-nine , " said Mr. Kingman briskly , " and has two businesses in San Francisco  --  a cocktail lounge and a beauty parlor . " At this point , Mme. Kuo , who changed chang-shans about every half hour during the evening , appeared in a pink satin outfit and introduced a chum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle of acquaintances ) , who lumbered up to the dais and said , " Maybe I 'm not much of a speaker , but fight anybody in the house . " Mme. Kuo beamed and , after Rocky had stepped down , announced the piece de resistance of the evening 's entertainment . It was to be a painting contest  --  a race , actually  --  between the General , Mr. Kingman , and Kam Tin Chuon , a Surrealistic artist famous for his screen paintings . Kam lin Choon would do a dragon , in honor of the New Year , she announced ; the General would do a rabbit , in honor of the old year ; and Mr. Kingman would do a lichee tree , just to be a good fellow . Mr. Kam , a thoughtful-looking young man , took up a position before a large screen , the General took up a position before a large square of cardboard on the dais table , and Mr. Kingman , who had stripped down to his shirtsleeves , took up a position before a large square of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his easel in the manner of a big-league pianist getting his piano stool just so , and then nodded to signify that he was ready . The three artists went to it with a will , but it was really no contest , since Mr. Kingman had his tree on paper in one minute and twenty seconds  --  half the time it took Mr. Kam and General Kuo to complete the dragon and the rabbit . " This here , " Mr. Kingman said , indicating a dot on his tree , " is a lichee nut . " " Put in another one , " somebody suggested . " Shall I ? " inquired Mr. Kingman . There were cries pro and con , and it looked for a while as if the New Year 's celebration might develop into a kind of artistic Donnybrook , but finally the anti-extra-lichee-nut faction triumphed , and the banquet was allowed to proceed , which it did with Roast Suckling Pig , Dragon Lobster , Chi'en Lung Chicken , and Lichee Snow Cake .

" MOSCOW Mission NEARLY two years ago , we introduced , in these pages , Mr. Stephen D. James , an indefatigable partisan of peace , who was then pursuing his goal by inviting anyone with a notion of how to prevent nuclear war to write to him at a post-office box and by publicizing a peace-hostage program of his own invention , which called for an exchange of millions of people between the United States and the Soviet Union ; today we 're back from a second visit with Mr. James , who in the interim has become president of the Peace Hostage Exchange Foundation , and who recently returned from a month-long stay in Moscow . A bespectacled man in his late thirties , Mr. James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression is grim when he discusses the awful necessity of keeping the peace and cheerful when he describes his efforts to present his peace-hostage program to the world at large . ? Ve met him in his Fifth Avenue office  --  tinv and one-room  --  and asked him how things had gone since our first chat . " Well , we 've surprised the skeptics , " said Mr. James , with a jubilant smile . " They all laughed when we sent out peace-hostage pledge blanks , but we got the signatures of nearly seven hundred and fifty volunteers , including those of the Reverend and Mrs. Robert L. Pierson , Governor Rockefeller 's son-in-law and daughter . The skeptics claimed we 'd never get hacking from responsible people , but Dr. Hobert Burns , who is Dean of the College of Education at Hofstra University , and Dr. B. James Raz , who is consultant in nuclear physics to the Argonne and Brookhaven National Laboratories , are trustees of the Peace Hostage Exchange Foundation ; Dr. Anatol Rapoport , who is a mathematical biologist at the University of Michigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawrence College , who is at present a consultant to the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency , are on our Advisory Council ; and our corporation counsel is Mr. James B. Donovan , who has volunteered to meet with our Russian counterparts in Geneva next June to negotiate the terms of a proposed pilot exchange of between thirty and fifty persons . The skeptics predicted we 'd never get the time of day from anybody in Washington , but Senator Javits and Senator Humphrey have praised the peace-hostage program in the Congressional Record as a stimulating concept , and I have been able to talk with and present our case to members of the 1AThite House staff , such as McGeorge Bundy . Skeptics are forever telling people what ca n't he done , but the fact is you can do practically anything if your cause is good , and if you have perseverance . A year and a half ago , I went to Ghana to attend the Accra Assembly on Disarmament . I took along a petition calling upon the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. to initiate a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk briefly-with President Nkrumah , and though I was n't able to get his signature on my petition , I did manage to sign up the Mayor of Accra . On my wag home , I stopped over in London and paid a call upon Mrs. Hugh Gaitskell . Mrs. Gaitskell said that she liked the peace-hostage idea , and made me a cup of tea . I 've found that you just ca n't be shy about selling peace . In other words , to open a door you have to try the knob . " At this point , Mr. James opened a drawer in his desk , pulled out an unsigned peace-hostage pledge blank , and handed it to us so quickly that we , thinking we detected a gleam in his eye , made haste to ask him ahout his trip to Russia . " Another example of where the skeptics were wrong , " Mr. James said quietly . " They scoffed at the idea that the Russians would ever be anything but completely suspicious of massive exchanges , but when I wrote a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Economic Commission under the Soviet Peace Committee , and also chairman of the Scientific Disarmament Commission at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations in Moscow 's Academy of Sciences , he wrote back expressing considerable interest As far as I 'm concerned , an expression of interest means that the door is open a crack , so I flew to Moscow to take advantage of that opening . I arrived on November 111th , carrying a suitcase full of peace-hostage propaganda and a portable tape recorder . The Russian customs people turned the tape recorder inside out , but they did n't bother much with the suitcase , which proved to be a good thing , because they overlooked a sheet of paper covered with reminders I had written myself , including one that read ' See Fred Barghoorn . ' He had been recommended to me as a leading expert on Soviet culture . When Professor Barg-boom was arrested , two days later , was afraid it would put a crimp in my plans , but I set about lobbying for peace , as usual . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is president of the Institute of Soviet-American Relations , asking if I could meet with her , and I dropped in unannounced on the Soviet Peace Committee headquarters , at 10 Kropotkin Street . The people there listened to my spiel politely , and told me I should see I. Glagolev , whom , of course , I 'd intended to see all along . Glagolev and I met a few nights later , in a basement conference room at a place called Friendship House , and we had a good give-and-take discussion about all aspects of massive exchanges . Only afterward did I learn that even as we were talking , Mrs. Khrushchev was upstairs , attending a celebration in honor of the thirtieth anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union , which , because of the Barg-boom affair , was being boycotted by the entire American community . What a chance I missed ! And especially in view of the fact that one of Mrs. Khrushchev 's deputies subsequently telephoned me to express her regret that she could not meet with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. James shook his head sadly and went on to tell us that he considered the arrest and detention of Professor Barghoorn a silly and stupid error on the part of the Russians , but that , boycott or no boycott , he would certainly have gone upstairs to tell Mrs. Khrushchev about the peace-hostage pro-grain if only he had known she was there . " And not just out of single-mindedness about my own aims , " he explained . " It 's a deep conviction of mine that this continuing history of sporadic acts of hostility at the official level should have little or no effect upon our efforts to keep the lines of communication open at the unofficial level . When you 're working for peace , you have to forge links during thaw or freeze . You 've always got to be ready to talk . During my stay in Moscow , I talked with a wide assortment of people , including scientists , writers , artists , teachers , and engineers . I found all of them to be vitally interested in peace . Not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One /z-vestier editor , whom I had met before , at the congress in Accra , accused me of idealism . I told him I 'd been accused of worse in my own country . On the other hand , the leaders of the All-Union Trade Union Council were enthusiastic about the possibilities of a hostage-exchange program . The Trade Union Council has a membership of seventy million , and whc-n I think of them as a possible source of hostages , I could almost drool . " GG RAFFITO on the wall of the West Fourth Street subway station , hard by New York University : BE ETHNIC Reception TOWARTOWARD the end of last month , D received an invitation that particularly pleased us . Edward T. Breathitt , Governor of Kentucky , we read , cordially invited us to a reception to he held in the library of the St. Regis Hotel . Now , we had never , to our knowledge , met a Governor of Kentucky , and here was one not only asking us to meet him but asking us to meet him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . What an unlooked-for conjunction of delectations ! We wrote the Governor , who is regarded as one of the South 's true progressives , that we were pleased to accept his kind invitation , and at the designated hour on the appointed day we presented ourself at the door of the library . The library of the St. Regis Hotel , as we think we have mentioned before , is a room whose tall shelves support a collection of real books , specially chosen for John Jacob Astor , the man who built the hotel , by Charles Scribner 's Sons in 1904 . We usually have our eye out for titles we have n't spotted on other occasions ( we recently noticed Lady Gregory 's " Cuchulain of Muirthemne " ) , but this time our attention was concentrated on Governor Breathitt , who was standing in the middle of the room , surrounded by a largish number of state officials and local reporters , and smiling broadly . As we advanced to meet the Governor , we found him to be of medium height , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recede . His official smile is as wide as a bluegrass plain . When we had shaken his hand , he said , in response to questions from us , that he is thirty-nine and is the state 's fifty-fifth governor ; that he was elected last fall , after serving three terms as a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives ; that he is interested in promoting travel to his state , for which purpose lie was holding this reception ; and that he is a lifelong Democrat . Then he said , " I want you to meet my wife , " and turned to beckon to a pretty woman in a pink dress and an orchid who was standing at the far side of the room chatting with a small group of officials . Mrs. Breathitt detached herself gracefully from the officials and joined us , and when we asked her what she thought of New York , she said , " Oh dear , we 've been here such a short time it 's hard to say ! We only got here yesterday , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we hope to see ' A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum ' after this reception tonight , and we have to get back home tomorrow . But we 're having a wonderful time . " She then directed us to sample all the Kentucky edibles that she and the Governor had brought with them for the reception . " And please do n't forget the jug band , " she called as we edged away to do her bidding . Shortly thereafter , we found ourself in a comfortable corner of the library with a mint julep ( its mint slightly wilted ) in one hand and a slice of Kentucky ham on a beaten biscuit in The other . Kentucky ham is similar to Virginia ham , but we found that  --  at least when it 's washed down by a mint julep  --  it tastes considerably sweeter than Virginia ham , which has always struck us as awfully dry . While we were munching and sipping contentedly , we cocked an ear for the strains of the jug band that Mrs. Breathitt had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it should be mentioned , is not an edible but an old-fashioned jazz band that includes
