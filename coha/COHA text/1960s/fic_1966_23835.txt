ANIMALS IN THE HOUSE A STORY BY NANCY HALE n the morning of the clay her husband would get back from the Bar Association meeting , Persia Hughes woke early and went down to get breakfast , in the old stone house the Hugheses had rented for the summer from friends named Stowe . They had only been in it a week , Just managing the two queer stoves , the antiquated soapstone sink , was still a challenging novelty to Persia . The kitchen was n't entirely strange to her , only unfamiliar to be in charge of ; she had helped Eleanor Stowe on a number of weekend visits , and in theory knew how things were operated . Like most of the Stowes ' friends , Persia had always admired the air of authenticity of their inherited house , and had been glad to rent it . Robert , her husband , who would have preferred something newer , had n't objected . She opened the back door that led out to a yard and leaned on the doorframe , breathing in delicious July air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was , at this hour , still cool . When she shifted her position , a rabbit she had n't noticed disappeared into the brush where the mowed grass stopped , twitching his cottontail . Birds flew out from under the eaves of the house where it made an angle with the kitchen wing ; they had a nest in there . Persis had no idea what kind of birds they were . Her son , Bobby , said he would look them up in his bird book , but of course had n't . Robert was not interested in birds . She closed the door and turned around facing the kitchen , anticipating the pleasure of carrying a cup of coffee into the yard and drinking it in solitude , the way she had yesterday morning and the day before . She 'd seemed to catch a whiff of some old , simpler happiness ; something half-remembered from long ago . The walls of the kitchen were stone , and whitewashed . The ceiling was bare boards and rafters . The sink had brass faucets , and next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a round black iron stove  --  a Shaker stove , Eleanor said  --  to give heat on nippy mornings , and a venerable electric range , its enamel indelibly marked with stains , for cooking . The burners took ages to heat up , irritating Robert . Nothing was convenient . But that had seemed the point , when Persia was deciding for the house . Somehow it seemed more genuine than having everything new and streamlined ; more honest than her customary way of life in a city apartment . She put on the kettle with water for drip coffee , to boil , and inserted two slices of bread into the toaster . She took orange juice in a glass jar from the noisy old refrigerator . She set a round tin tray with a plate , cup , saucer , and glass , and was just picking up the jar from the kitchen table to pour orange juice into the glass when she noticed a point sticking up out of one of the two lids of the black iron stove . Triangularly shaped , the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . Persia set the jar down , went across the big kitchen to the stove , and peered at the triangular point . It was dark gray , and trembled . With the lifter , she took off the other lid . After a second 's frantic commotion , a bird burst up out . of the stove and began flying around the room in great whirring sweeps . The stove lid crashed from Persil 's hand . She stood like a woman trapped in a bad dream , hands to her hair , eyes following the bird , helpless to move . Without shifting anything but her eyes she looked at the living-room door . The chance that she would take if she opened it , of letting the bird out into the rest of the house , seemed too terrible . A bird loose in the house ! Persia 's eyes returned to that fearful zooming . Crash ! The bird hit the window over the set tubs and dropped into the sink . In another moment it was up and out again , and again circling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living room and closed the door after her . " Bobby ! " she called . " Come quick ! There 's a bird in the kitchen ! " She started toward the stairs to run and shake her nine-year-old son awake . He was at the top of the stairs before she could reach them  --  in rumpled pajamas , face pleased and intent as he tore down the stairs in bare feet and ran across to the kitchen door . Persia followed , her panic gone . Bobby threw her a conspiratorial glance as he silently opened the door . Understanding it , she slipped in instantly after him . When they were in the kitchen , she leaned against the living-room door , trembling , her hands behind her back as she watched Bobby stand watching the bird . As soon as it dashed itself against a window again and dropped down to the sill , he was there beside it , with both hands surrounding the bird 's body  --  gently , with some kind of physical wisdom . He threw his mother a nod ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the door , stepped out , and let the bird fly out of his hands . He stood and watched it fly away to the top of a tree , where it sat on a branch twitching its feathers . Persis began to laugh . She was thankful Robert had not been there to witness her shame . Bobby gave a little , pleased laugh , too , as though surprised and delighted at the way the day had begun . He came in and sat down at the kitchen table . " My , you handled that well ! " she said . " How did you ever know how ? " He shrugged his shoulders . " I d'no , " he said . " I was scared , " she said . He looked at her with gray , liquid eyes  --  calm , interested . " Were you ? " he said , conversationally . He took a plum out of the bowl of plums on the table , and began eating it , watching his mother as she moved about the kitchen to get breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way you did , " she went on , taking the milk out of the refrigerator which , at the slamming of its door , burst out again into noisy throbbing . She took Wheaties , the Breakfast of Champions , from the pine cupboard that was more than a hundred years old . " I could n't have borne to put my hands on it , I do n't know why , exactly , " she was saying , when out of the open hole in the iron stove  --  she had never replaced the lid  --  flew a second bird . Now again she had to lean weakly against the living-room door ; but now Bobby was with her and once more went into action  --  waiting till the bird , in its wild circlings , stunned itself against a window , then smoothly covering it with his small brown hands . Persia held the outside door open again , and Bobby released the second bird . When it , too , had flown off , she shut the door . She came and dropped down at the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face down close , he peered into the hole . " Musta come down the stovepipe , " he declared joyfully and came and sat down at the table beside her . " They musta had a nest up there , and something shook them down . Boy , was I surprised ! Another bird ! Boy ! " " What kind were they ? Do you know ? " she asked . " Starlings , I think , " he said cordially , as though being asked were an agreeable surprise . " I 'll look them up in my book . " " Please do . You were going to look up the birds under the eaves , " she reminded him . " I 'd like to know the name of what scared me so ! ? What would I have done , if you had n't known what to do , " she continued , dramatically . " There I stood , frozen to the ground ! As if I were somebody in a castle , locked in a spell . Maybe forever ! " Feeling much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast . " Boy ! " Bobby said fervently , and shook his head at her plight . " ? Hey , Mom , " he said . " I was going to take that boat out of the cellar and put it in the water , remember ? How about it ? " " That was before your father went to New York , " she said . She turned around and looked at him , troubled . " Maybe he can help you when he gets back , " she said . Bobby wriggled in his chair . " I know . But we could try . " " Okay , " she granted . She would grant him anything , but she was sure they were not going to be able to get that huge , dry , old blue dory out of the Stowes ' cellar by themselves . She began casting about in her mind for somebody in this unfamiliar neighborhood she could ask to help . Thinking about the boat , making the coffee , fishing the hardened toast out of the toaster and making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commencing to eat breakfast there , she could tell  --  the way in a dream , sometimes , she could tell she was asleep  --  that the memory of her panic over the birds had dissolved and drifted away . Late that afternoon , while she was raking up weeds she had pulled out of the zinnia bed beside the front door , she saw a big woodchuck . He was on the other side of the front yard , hurrying along with fussy , bumbling steps in front of the tangle of raspberry canes . She straightened up to watch him , and at that moment spied Robert walking up the hill in the jaunty hard straw hat he affected , with its red-and-blue fraternity ribbon , carrying the evening paper from the box by the road . It seemed a fortunate juxtaposition of events . She followed the woodchuck with her eyes as he dove into the raspberries , and turned , laughing , to greet her husband , who kissed her enthusiastically . " I 've seen more animals ! " she began . " Rabbits , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the bushes . Wildlife all over ! " " That 's fine , " Robert said in his rather nasal , witty voice . He was tall and well-built . The smooth , shiny , tanned skin on his face bore not the slightest line or wrinkle ; his hair was thinning gold-color . His mouth was wry . Persis had often noticed how many lawyers did have wry mouths . As they strolled nearer the house he put his arm around his wife . " Oh , and the birds , " Persis suddenly could not stop herself from saying . " There were birds in the house , this morning . They came down through the kitchen stove , and flew all around . I was terrified . I had to get Bobby . I just could n't stand it . " Robert paused on the path . " Why , on earth ? " he asked . " I do n't know , " she said . " Sort of a panic . " He was silent as they climbed the granite steps to the house  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something made her say , flirtatiously , " Are n't you going to sympathize with me ? I was really terrified . " He gave her a small , embarrassed smile . " Well , since you ask me , no , " he said , quite seriously . They paused together on the top step , and turned around to look at the sea . This was always done on the top step . When they 'd visited the Stowes here , the Stowes had always done it , and the Hugheses had inherited the custom . " I ca n't sympathize with something silly , " he said . " I would if there was something to sympathize with . " She felt angry at being preached to . Times she had sympathized with Robert flashed , synoptically , through her head . She 'd sympathized with him , she thought , because he needed sympathy , not because she did n't think he was  --  sometimes  --  silly . But if she said that , she would have to say that she sometimes thought him silly ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tongue . " What did you do about the stovepipe ? " Robert asked . But an urgent topic had suggested itself to Persis . She launched into it . " Bobby 's dying to get that boat into the water , " she said . " It would be good for him to have a boat , do n't you think so ? I wondered . Would you help him get it out of the cellar , maybe after supper ? " " Well , but not tonight , " Robert said . He took his arm away . " I 'm tired . It 's been a rough two days , you know . " Persis remembered she had not yet asked him about the meeting . But it seemed mere important to get the problem of the boat settled . " Just it would mean so much to him . To get it out tonight , " she said . " No doubt , " Robert said . He tossed the folded newspaper down on the table in the living room they had walked into . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father is a working man . " " Oh , Robert ! Please ! " she cried . Why did she have to cry out like that ? She knew how Robert hated emotion . " He 's so dependent on you for love ! You know boys need their fathers . . . . Ca n't you be a little more interested in what he does ? " She stopped , trembling . Then she went on . " He needs a boat this summer , Robert . And you 're the only person who can help him get it nut of the cellar . I tried , this morning , but we did n't get anywhere . " " I have seldom heard , " Robert began in a courtroom manner , " a more extravagant statement . I am far from the only person whn can help him . There is , to start with , the man down the hill , married to the egg woman  --  what 's her name . There are , in addition , those three great louts who sell lobsters on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house in the course of the day  --  garbage , laundry ? " " But they 're not logical people to help ! You 're the logical person ! " " Logical ! " Robert said , hooting . " I 'm tired ! Why do you pick on me ? " " How could I ask them to help ? They 've got work of their own . They 're not odd-job men . " " Pay them , " he said . " They 'd think it pretty peculiar , getting paid to help a little boy with a boat when he 's got a perfectly able-bodied father . " a story by Nancy Hale 97 " My dear Persis . It 's immaterial to me what they think . " " ? To say nothing of how Bobby will feel . His own father , not willing to help him ! " " If you keep babying that boy , Persis , you 'll make him into a monster . Expecting everybody to drop what they 're doing to wait on him . " She laughed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to wait on him , " she said . " It 's not kindness , what you 're doing . Spoiling him . " She could n't speak for anger . She could see Bobby 's pleased , interested face before her eyes . How could she express to Robert how unspoiled she knew he was ? She could n't even begin . She could only compare that face with the clever , confident one before her . There was no use in speaking anyway . By this time , there was n't one chance in a million Robert would help Bobby with the boat . He 'd argued himself into a position where it was impossible . They had been standing up , facing each other . Now Robert picked up the evening paper and dropped into the chair by the window . Putting on his glasses , opening the paper , he buried his face in the news . " Why ca n't we have a normal family life , all doing things together , instead of everybody off doing things separately ? " Persis exclaimed . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would have irritated her . Robert made no reply . He merely lowered the paper , and over his glasses gave her a long , withering glance . After supper they sat together peacefully in the living room , while mammoth moths and June bugs batted against the screen door . Robert was reading the reports of the meeting he 'd been to , Persis had socks to mend . Over at the dining table , under the strong overhead light , Bobby was mending a balsa-wood airplane model he had triumphantly completed the week before . Then tragedy had struck ; in the darkness of his bedroom he 'd stepped on it . Persis kept glancing up from her work to watch his hands as they moved skillfully among the bits of wood  --  applying glue , pressing delicate tips of wooden rods together , After a while Bobby slipped out of his chair . " Hey , Mom , " he said . " I 'm going over to Junior Perkins ' . Okay ? " She looked at her watch . " It 's eight-thirty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Okay . " Robert raised his head from the pile of reports . " Is that all you 're going to say ? " he said . " Me ? " Bobby paused in his dash across the room and looked at his father , with his receptive expression , his mouth slightly curved in the beginnings of a smile . " Are n't you going to say , ' Thanks , Mother , I 'll be back at ten ? ' " " I did say ? " " No you did n't . You said Okay , or Hey Mom , or some similar locution . You did n't even ask your mother if you could go . You told her you were going . " " Gee , Mom , I 'm sorry , " Bobby said . " Oh  --  thank you and I 'll be back about ten . " " At ten , " his father said . " At ten , " Bobby said . Edging over to the front door he opened it and slipped out . Sneakered footsteps could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at Robert , hoping he would look up so that she could smile forgivingly at him , when they first heard the noise . Persis dropped her work , sat up straight , and said , " What 's that Robert stiffened . " I do n't hear anything , " he said , though she could tell he had . She went back to her sewing . In another moment the noise came again ; a sort of clattering thump . " It , sounds upstairs , " she said . She glanced at Robert , wondering if saying that would make him take a stand against going to investigate . " More like outdoors , to me , " he said . She had to smile . But there was nothing funny about the noise . " I wonder what it can be , " she said . " Most likely birds , " Robert said . " More birds . " " Honestly ! " she said . " Birds ! " " Outside , " he added in a patient , explaining voice . " Birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't bang around outside in the middle of the night in the trees , " she said . " Look , Persia , " he said . He put down the report he had been reading , in his lap . " What 's the matter with you ? Do you want it to be something bad ? " " What do you mean ? " she began ; but the noise interrupted her . This time Persis snatched the flashlight from the table , ran upstairs , and tiptoed into the bedroom that opened onto the upstairs porch . As she got near the screen door , she heard the noise again , outside . Carefully she locked the screen door . Then she switched the flash on , and moved its beam around the dark porch . At first there seemed to be nothing ; but then she saw it  --  a raccoon , standing half in , half out of the bars of the railing that enclosed the porch . Its head was turned and it wore an intelligent expression on its face , with the spectacled markings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Persis tiptoed away to the top of the stairs . " Robert ! Conic quick ! Quick ! I want to show you something , " she hissed . Waiting impatiently , she realized she should n't have told him to be quick if she did n't want him to be slow . When he got upstairs , she led him to the porch door . For a moment , searching the darkness with the flash , she feared the raccoon had gone away , and began to imagine with what impatience and incredulity Robert would receive her story . He 'd never believe there had been a raccoon , up here . Then she spotted it . It was on the roof that came down to one end of the porch , and it was backing up . When the beam of light struck its face , it stopped short , head turning to look at them , with that responsive , intelligent expression . She heard Robert cluck . After they went downstairs again she said , " Was n't that fantastic ? We seem to be completely surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I only meant it 's interesting , " she said . " It 's probably the same raccoon as the one that 's been at the garbage can . Do n't you think it 's a little peculiar  --  a raccoon on the roof ? On the upstairs porch ? Everywhere ? " " Not everywhere , " he said . " Actually , I think he was trying to figure how to get down off theporch . Looked as if he might have been scared to go back whatever way he came up  --  up some tree , I suppose  --  and was looking for another way down . " " But why should he go up on the porch ? " " Search me . " They heard it , then  --  the raccoon , high on the roof of the steep-gabled house . " You see ? He 's going over the top , " Robert said , sounding gratified . " He 's crossing over to where it is n't so high off the ground  --  the shed back of the kitchen , likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later they heard a rattling in the garbage can by the back door . Persis went to scare the raccoon off , as she had learned to do since the night when the raccoon overturned the can , spilling garbage all over the yard . " Boo ! " she shouted out the back door , clapping her hands together . Something , at any rate , shuffled off in the darkness . " Are we saved from imminent peril ? " Robert asked when she returned to the lighted room . " For the nonce , " she replied , smiling at him . He smiled back , but just then the telephone rang . Robert and Persia exchanged looks . The Bar Association won over the trip to the garbage can , and Persia answered the telephone . It was Eleanor Stowe , calling to see how they were making out in the house . Persis praised the view , the weather they were having , the peacefulness , and then she cried , " Oh ! I have n't told you about the raccoon ! " " Him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a regular visitor . Tonight he was up on the porch off your room . What do you suppose he was after ? " " I have no idea , " Eleanor said . " Schemeswise , he 's miles ahead of me . For heaven 's sake , do n't let them in . " " Them ? " " I 'm not sure it 's always the same raccoon , " Eleanor said . " There may be a big family , for all I know . Generations of them . This has been going on for years .... You know the Jenkins ? Down the road in Harborport ? I think they came to dinner last summer when you were staying with us . " " Oh , yes . The architect . " " They have a cottage on their place , that they used to rent summers . But now they ca n't anymore because the raccoons moved in . They ca n't get them out . They hired an exterminator , and tried everything anybody suggested , but the raccoons are still there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . " " How awful i " " Is n't it ? Creepy . Well , just do n't let them in , that 's all . The way they got entrenched at the Jenkins ' is , the last people who rented it left the cellar door standing open when they left . Just be sure to keep the doors closed . " " I wilt , " Persia said . As she hung up , a sense of horror at the idea of a house wholly possessed by raccoons filled her ; then she turned , dramatically , and told Robert about the Jenkins ' cottage . She thought the story should take him aback a trifle . Things sometimes were awful , were frightening ; she was not such a fool ! After she had finished , she paused to let the lesson sink in . Robert only said , " Very interesting . They have a problem there , " and cleared his throat . " It 's ten o'clock , " he said , checking his wristwatch . " Bobby takes the most outrageous advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away with murder . " Persis threw him a sharp - glance . Then she picked up her mending . " He 'll be back in a moment , " she said serenely . " He never lets me down . " " Indeed , " Robert said . " Yes , " she said . In her mind she began to count ? one , two , three , four ... forty-five , forty-six , forty-seven ... betting with herself the way she used to when she was a child , that the thing she wanted to happen , would happen , by the time she got to a hundred . Then to two hundred . Then to three , " Ten-twenty ! " Robert exclaimed at last . " So Bobby never lets you down ! He ought to be ashamed of himself . " " Oh , Robert , " she said . " Why do you have to get so mad at him ? " " I 'm not mad ! I just want to make something out of him . Somebody 's got to train him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of childhood , " she said , irritating even herself . Robert compressed his lips . Persis felt a longing for this issue of the child to be once and for all settled between them . It seemed always in the way . Then Bobby walked in . He opened the door , rather , and slipped in  --  casting an apprehensive look at his father as he shut the door after him silently , and stood waiting , with a self-conscious smile , at the front of the living room . " Hiya , ionises , " he said , after a moment 's silence . Robert rolled up his eyes . " You never learned to say that in this house , " he said . " It 's meant for a joke , " Persis said . " Junior Perkins ' mother says it . " " Oh . Ha-ha , " Robert said . He shut his wry lawyer 's mouth . Then he pushed his glasses down to a story by Nancy Hale 99 the end of his nose and turned to inspect his son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " You told Mother you 'd be in at ten . " Bobby rubbed one sneaker against the other and shrugged his shoulders . " I d'no , " he said . " Oh , Robert , " Persis said . " It 's not all that im-portant . " Robert turned his gaze on his wife . " Oh , it is n't ? " he said . " All right .. Have it your way . I resign , " he added . Persia laughed to show Bobby his father did n't mean it . " Get on now , " she said to him . " It 's late . Bed for boys ! I 'll be up . " Robert put the report down again . " You mean that , after this , you 're going up to say good-night to him ? " It seemed a reasonable concession . " No , " she said . " I wo n't be up . You were late , darling , and you must learn not to be . Say good-night , now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... good-night . " Skirting his father 's chair he came around and kissed his mother . Then he kissed his father humbly , his mother thought , without any resentment . He let them do whatever they chose to him , and then humbly kissed them . She watched Bobby go slowly upstairs . His small , young neck was held up straight , and he rubbed his hand thoughtfully along the unpainted plaster as he passed . Up he climbed , until the stairs took him outside the range of her vision . " Well ! " Robert gave Persis a reconciliatory smile . She knew he wanted her , too , to feel delighted that Bobby had gone to bed . Soon he would be asleep , and they could be alone . She finished the pair of socks she had been making neat darns in , folded them into a ball , and rose . She stuffed her darning egg and needle case back into her work box . It was a gesture that felt oddly familiar to her , as though she had watched a. hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " I 'm going to bed . " " Sorry you 're tired , " Robert said . He sighed . In the lamplight he lifted his smooth face to receive her kiss . " Good-night . Do n't let the raccoons bite . " " I 'll try not to , " she said . She went off up the stairs without looking back . When she looked into Bobby 's room , his even breathing in the darkness told her he was asleep already . She went to her room and started undressing ; her heart ached . Time slipped by so fast . Soon she would have no child at all . She went into the bathroom and began to brush her teeth . The mechanical routine of brushing soothed her , so that she forgot her sorrow . The bathroom window , which overlooked the 100 ANIMALS IN THE HOUSE backyard where the trash can stood , was shut ; but something was clawing gently at the glass from outside . A stiff tendril of grapevine , Persis told herself . She told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only surely she had not heard it before ? Quite as well as the grapevine , it could be the raccoon scratching at the window . He was so intelligent , he could do anything . The other night when he upset the can , he 'd had to turn the handle of the can down , unlocking it , to do so . Persis allowed herself a sharp glance at the dark windowpane , just in case the intelligent face of the raccoon really were there , peering at her out of the night , with its questioning gaze . What was in that mysterious animal mind ? What did he want of her ? She kept on brushing her teeth diligently to quiet her fears , but the scratching noise kept on . Perhaps the raccoon had his mate with him . Two raccoons , scratching at her window ! , Perhaps more ! Perhaps all those raccoon generations Eleanor had conjectured were ranged around this house  --  prowling around it , over the roof , up on the porch , at the window , at all the doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toothbrush down on the glass shelf . She was shaking . She wanted to call Robert , but there was no use in that . He would only say that there were n't animals ranged all around the house . He would say they were not plotting to get in . He would say she was being foolish . But feeling foolish only made her more afraid . Her mind , pinned in , sought everywhere , in fancy , for help . All through the downstairs of this house it hurried , wringing its hands , looking for ? the mop ? the poker ? ? It climbed the stairs , frantic to find something ; somebody . And there lay Bobby , in bed and sweetly breathing in his sleep . He 'd sit up , surprised and pleased to be awakened , and so interested in what she had to tell him . " My , I was scared ! " she 'd say . " You were ? " he 'd say . And then , naturally , she was n't scared any more . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she told herself . But , her now-peaceful train of thought continued as she put cold cream on her face , she would tell him in the morning . In the morning , down in the kitchen in the radiant morning sunshine , she would tell him all about the raccoons . She 'd begin with the raccoon on the upstairs porch tonight  --  in the tension after Bobby got in , she had n't had a chance to . She could imagine how his eyes would shine . " On the porch , Mom ? " he 'd ask . " He turned around and looked at you ? " " Yes , " she 'd say , nodding , knowing how interesting she was being . " He turned around with this questioning look . Maybe he was saying , in raccoon language , ' What do you want ? ' " Bobby would love that . Her mind paused , then , as she was getting into bed , and she thought , No . He would n't love that any longer . He had passed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts about things as they really were . So she would n't tell him about the scratching at the window , after all . Persis turned out the light . But she would tell him about the raccoon 's crossing high up over the roof . And about there being other raccoons , generations of raccoons ... ranged outside all the openings of this house . in the night . . " Persis ! " Robert was shouting at her from downstairs . She had been practically asleep . She jumped up and ran to the top of the stairs . Robert was standing at the bottom , his face dark crimson in the light from the living room . " What in hell do you think you 're doing , leaving the back door unlocked ? " he demanded when he saw her . She started downstairs in her nightgown , blinking . " Well ... you were still up , " she said , confused . " I did n't know I needed to lock up yet . " " God damn it ! " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to keep the goddamned raccoons from moving in . . . . " She stopped and stared at him . She was close enough , now , to see his eyes , and see in them , hidden behind the anger , fear  --  pent up , inadmissible . She would never be able to understand how Robert 's mind worked . She did know anything she said now would be wrong , whether in recognition , pity , or sympathy . She came the last three steps down the stairs and put her arms around him .
