Up the Down Staircase is a skillful culling of memorable moments from Bel Kaufman 's novel about a teacher 's struggle in a New York " problem-area " high school . They have been assembled by Writer Tad Mosel and Director Robert Mulligan into an entertainment of high spirits , its sheen unscratched by the book 's real point . <P> Sandy Dennis plays Tyro Schoolmarm Sylvia Barrett and re-creates with considerable grace her abandonment of college-bred tenets and concepts to cope with realities in the concrete jungle . Both antagonistic forces-a bunch of surly , underprivileged kids on one side and a school administration of monolithic obtuseness on the other-abound in stereotypes : the unloved Fat Girl , the sullen boy with a streak of buried brilliance , the love-hungry spinster , the platitude-spinning principal and his vicious , misanthropic assistant . <P> But they are stereotypes only because they exist profusely in life , as Novelist Kaufman came to realize in her 17 years of teaching . Her book is more than a gallery of grotesques ; it evokes the frustration of the teacher smothered under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureaucracies . In presenting the gallery without the guts , the producers offer an attractive movie while overlooking a potentially important one . <P> Even so , Staircase is a superior example of its genre . Much of its impact comes from Director Mulligan 's eye for setting and atmosphere . His Calvin Coolidge High is an actual Manhattan school building , its rust and raunch unretouched for the camera , and his neighborhood is a horrifyingly typical New York slum street . His supporting cast , notably Sorrell Booke as the exasperated principal and Florence Stanley as a guidance counselor in love with instant evaluation , is ideal . So is Fred Karlin 's musical score , in its ironic blending of baroque blandness and jungle throb . <P> In the end , however , it is the kids themselves who provide the ring of truth . Mulligan did his casting on the city 's streets , and coaxed from a group of inexperienced youngsters ( some of whom showed up for work with switchblades ) a series of magnificent life studies . One unforgettable moment : Ellen O'Mara as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms of the English teacher ( Patrick Bedford ) she idolizes , her square pudding face aglow in awe and beatification . At such moments , rare in cinematic annals , the camera uses unadorned reality as its point of departure and comes around full circle .
