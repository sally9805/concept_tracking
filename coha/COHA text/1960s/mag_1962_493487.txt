BOOKS AND THE ARTS How effective , though bizarre , was the recent appearance in The New Yorker of James Baldwin 's " Letter from a Region in My Mind " ! His essay was as striking as the appearance of Baldwin himself at a cocktail party in Westchester , flanked by affluent , self-conscious sponsors . For it is obvious from the advertisements in The New Yorker that its readers have access to places where James Baldwin ( in the figurative sense ) can not go . Thus , much of the effect of his presence in that magazine was due to the kind of advertising that was paying ( inadvertently , perhaps ) for his appearance . It is The New Yorker 's practice , generally , to allow each essay at least a full page at the outset ; after that , the prose must take its chances . Although the first two pages of Baldwin 's essay are free of any advertising , they contain a drawing of tenement fronts and a cartoon of a young man facing an intransigent banker over a desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The young man is saying : " I hate to have to say , sir , that you are not quite everything John K. M. McCaffery has led me to expect . " The tone is dry , and the reference both topical and esoteric . On the third page there is nothing but an advertisement for a cosmetic ? head , shoulders and arms of a blonde model dressed in black ; the remainder of the page black with white lettering . Four kinds of type carry the message : " Give yourself the luminous look of youth with / Superglow fluid make-up . / The only make-up containing ' Lumium , ' / ... which reflects light instead of absorbing it , to give your make-up / the very glow of life . ' Superglow ' is made in a wide range / of shades . One ... was designed for you . " Useless , of course , to the little old lady in Harlem . The next two pages contain one column of Baldwin to five of advertisingin which the reader is offered an " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " at $13oo.00 " plus tax , " and a diamond clip and bracelet for a total of $18,500.00 , " tax included . " One is also offered ? full-page , color ? the opportunity to buy " A Blue Chip . " The vehicle for the metaphor is a sky-blue Lincoln Continental . Walking toward the car , in the background , is a young man in a dark suit and tie , white shirt , and carrying a dark attache case . Then , also in color , the reader is told that " Knowledgeable people buy Imperial and they buy it by the case . " A chauffeur ( race obscured by a box of whiskey ) , walks toward a Rolls-Royce limousine . Opposing this , and slightly crowding the single column of Bald-win 's essay , is a three-strand string of pearls with a diamond clasp , $1.5o,000 ( including federal tax ) . The pearls , as in a jeweler 's display case , rest against a black background . Turning the page , we find two opposing columns of a single perfume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baldwin . " Leave a little of yourself , " we are told , " wherever you go . " On the opposite page , stands Captain Kangaroo , arms upraised behind the violin section of an orchestra . It is an announcement of a television program , and the copy below informs us that " Where Captain Kangaroo leads , children by the millions follow . With warmth and whimsy and wonderful gentleness , he instructs youngsters ( to quote a Peabody Award citation ) ' in safety , in ethics , in health , without interrupting the serious business of entertaining them ' . " " That summer , " writes James Baldwin of his fourteenth year ( opposite Captain Kangaroo ) , " ail the fears with which I had grown up , and which were now a part of me , and controlled my vision of the world , rose up like a wallbetween the world and me , and drove me into the church . " Moving on , we again find a single column of prose flanked , on the one side , by two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full-page promotion of a silverplate tea service ( in black and white ) , which advises us of " a fascinating new hobby afoot : collecting silver pieces in all of the different patterns .

" " Yes , " writes Baldwin ? next to Spode dinnerware ( " Do n't Wait to Inherit Spode " ) and French wine ? " it does indeed mean something ? something unspeakable ? to be born , in a white country , an Anglo-Teutonic , antisexual country , black . You very soon , without knowing it , give up all hope of communion . " Turning the page , we find a black-andwhite montage promoting a racetrack : " Jump up and down . Scream . Yell . Store up enough thrills to last you through the winter ahead .... Special Thanksgiving Day schedule starts at 11:00 .

All you do is enjoy your trip to Europe on the 55 United States " ) , towels ( featuring a rose pattern : " Everything 's rosy ! " ) Across from the towels , Baldwin is discussing jazz and the blues , " the depths out of which such an ironic tenacity comes .

" ) What we are presented with is what the Surrealists call a " hazard " event , a coincidental ( and therefore meaningful ) juxtaposition of contradictory quantities . What else can be made of the conjunctive appearance of James Baldwin 's essay and this catalogue of luxury . Crushed between the stones of solace is the sound of agony . " Simplify !

White , has an interest in Walden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it fills its pages with advertisements for useless junk , is being hypocritical . On the contrary , I should like to praise The New Yorker for its courage in printing James Baldwin 's essay amidst the overwhelming evidence of the material concerns of its readers . It is an effort which bears comparison with Thoreau 's erection of a shack in 1840 Massachusetts . On the verso of the advertisement for champagne which faces the last page of Baldwin 's essay , there is a color advertisement for face powder , which brings the circle full round . On a field of black , four shades of powder have been spread in even , tangent rows , and placed on this banner are three compacts : one black , one gold , one black , gold , and white .

" If the world of James Baldwin is one which is split into blacks and whites , so is the world of The New Yorker , of pearls and velvet , silver and ebony , powder and mascara , whitewalls and tuxedos . To join those two worlds , it seems to me , would be as simple and as effective as placing pearls against black velvet .
