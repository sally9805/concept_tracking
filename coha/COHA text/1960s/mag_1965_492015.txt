. 1 WAS hardly expecting trouble . It was a pleasant Sunday afternoon in August , and John Thimas and I were driving down a busy street in Roxbury , a Negro section of Boston . We were passing Roxbury 's Black Muslim mosque when a pink Cadillac pulled away from the curb , cutting us off . I sat there at the wheel , vaguely impatient , waiting for the driver to pick up his passenger , or whatever it was he was going to do , and drive off . Suddenly four men I recognized as Black Muslim goons rushed to John 's side of the car . The door flew open and they dragged him out , hitting him with short , flat-handed karate chops . Before I had a chance to move , someone reached in through the open rear window and grabbed me around the neck . Three or four others opened the door beside me. seized me by the legs and yanked I wrapped my arms around the door-post and held on for dear life , but someone kicked me hard in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let go . I fell flat on the street , and the goons crowded around me. punching , kicking and stomping . We were lucky , though . Traffic was piling up behind us ; horns were honking , bystanders were screaming , and the neighborhood people were running out of their houses and out of the stores to find out what was happening . A photographer came running up the street , snapping pictures , and several of the goons dropped John and went chasing after the photographer to get that camera and destroy the film I was still laid out on the street and being worked over . I had grabbed one goon tightly around the legs , and he was screaming . " Kick him ! Kick him ! " I felt a sharp kick on the base of my spine and I could feel the numbness go right through me . Someone stomped on my ankle , and I could feel the ankle crunch beneath the boot . After about five or 10 minutes the screaming and the honking finally scared them off . I was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars behind us was trying to help me get cleaned up . He said there had been 13 of the goons . I stand five feet six and weigh 130 pounds ; the members of the Muslim terror squad are all strapping six-footers . They left me with a broken ankle . two THE MUSLIM FRAUD fractured ribs . a fractured vertebra , damaged kidneys and internal bleeding . I was in the hospital for a week , in bed at home for another week and out of work for a total of three weeks . My ankle was in a cast for a month . The beating was most probably an act of revenge . I had been an official of Boston 's Mosque No , II for three years , and John Thimas was at one time my assistant . I believe we were beaten as punishment for quitting and also as a warning to us to keep our mouths shut . I had quit because I had grown weary of being hoodwinked and of hoodwinking others . The Muslims ' basic and powerful argument is that , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must withdraw from white society and band together to improve their lot . This solution sounds so simple that Negroes are easily beguiled into thinking it works . Even influential and responsible Negroes like football star Jimmy Brown have been led to believe that the Muslims have an active program for education , economic uplift , moral rehabilitation , family harmony and brotherhood . All myths . The Nation of Islam ( the official name of the Muslim organization ) is a moneymaking proposition which bleeds its followers dry . When its peculiar quackery fails to bring in money in the name of charity , it resorts to terror , violence and extortion . My background made me a most unlikely prospect for the Muslims . I was a college senior majoring in business administration at Boston University when I first heard of the Muslims . I was married , had three children , and , in addition to attending college , was working a full night shift at the post office . More than that , I had never known the hardships that drive Negroes to desperation . My father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better-than-average living . We never lived in ghettos , but in reasonably well-integrated areas . One of my brothers not only went to Columbia University on a full scholarship but was elected president of his sophomore class . In July of 1958 another brother , Cart , having attended a couple of Muslim meetings in Los Angeles , was going around the house quoting the Bible and telling my wife Ruth and me about the Muslims ' program for the advancement of the Negro . We were impressed enough to go to a meeting with him . Carl had not really joined the mosque enormous importance , the carrier of some potent message , to be protected so carefully . As I was led from the search room , I was passed on to another brother , who led me to a seat in the front row , where all first-time visitors are brought . Almost immediately a huge man  --  a lieutenant  --  loomed up in the aisle , front and center , stationing himself between the minister and the congregation . Another official took a seat in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assemblage . When the minister came to the lectern , other lieutenants began patrolling the side aisles . The minister , Louis X , was about 26 ? my own age . I knew all about him , because Carl had told me he was Gene Walcott . a handsome , talented and not unsuccessful calypso singer . I had seen him perform around Boston a couple of years earlier , billed as " The Charmer . " Minister Louis knew something about me too  --  it is standard procedure to brief the minister on the first-timers . He told the rest of the audience how wonderful it was for a college student to show such interest in the racial problem . Pointing out that I was studying business administration , Minister Louis then spoke to me directly . " Whose business are you going to administer to ? " he asked . " Do you think the white devil is going to let you run his business ? " " Teach on , " chanted the audience behind me . " You telling the truth . " And then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nation of Islam had built in Chicago and about the enormous strides that were being made toward building a similar complex in Boston . Most of his teaching , however , was nothing more than a commentary on current events as they applied to the Negro 's position in America . His text , I noted with surprise , was taken not from the Koran but from a column which Elijah Muhammad , head of the Nation of Islam , was writing for the Pittsburgh Courier . Any resemblance between the Black Muslims and the real religion of Islam was , I discovered in the end , almost coincidental . The minister opens with an Arabic phrase , " As-salaam-alaikum " ( " Peace be unto you " ) , and the congregation responds , " Wa-alaikum-salaam " ( " And unto you peace also " ) , And that 's the last Arabic anybody hears . During my first years in the Nation , the members were specifically forbidden to buy even an English version of the Koran . Those who pressed for a reason were told bluntly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . " It was n't until the captain of the mosque in Newark , N.J. , got himself a franchise for importing Karam from Pakistan that the policy underwent a sudden change . All members were now urged to order copies from him . Purchases from any other source were still strictly forbidden . My brother Carl , having got us involved , attended only a couple of more meetings , found the discipline uncongenial , and cut out for good . Ruth , however , was fascinated , because she had learned that the women were given the opportunity to teach the young children such things as manners and personal hygiene . She joined about six months later . I did n't join , not then . Though I had graduated from college with a B.S. in business administration in August . 1958 , I was still working at the post office  --  with overtime I could earn far more than I could possibly earn starting out fresh in the business world  --  and I had also taken an evening job as an insurance agent . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1960 , we had bought our own one-family home , we had a new automobile , and we had some money in the bank . I was 28 years old . I joined for a combination of reasons . Ruth felt that since I had a college degree I should be making some kind of contribution to the Muslims ' program for educating Negro children . The opportunity to put my own business education to work in that burgeoning business empire Minister Louis was always telling me about appealed to me . And , most important of all , I suppose , I did have my own guilt feelings about remaining on the sidelines at a time when the racial situation was finally coming to a boil . There was another reason too . In those two intervening years Minister Louis had written a musical play , Orono ( " A Negro " spelled backward ) , in which the white man was put on trial for creating the conditions that led to the black man 's degradation ( " If the Negro is a dope addict , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a drunkard , who sells him the whiskey ? " ) and for lulling him with a religion that robbed him of his right to defend himself ( " Did God want the Negro , whose cheek is already busted , to turn the other cheek ? " ) . Orgena had been produced in several major cities , with Louis himself playing the lead . Louis said he wanted me to tour with it and take over the publicity and promotion . That little project folded abruptly , however , when Elijah Muhammad forced Louis to abandon his play . The reason should have been obvious to me from the beginning . Now , after more than three years as a Muslim , I see the basic contradiction between the Muslims ' dogma and all that fine , fond talk about uplifting the Negro . I came to realize that the one thing the Muslims can not live with is success . It is impossible to preach total disaffection to anyone who is making his way in the real world . The Muslims display a vested interest in failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no less than the Ku Klux Klan , want to " keep the Negro in his place . " If Louis succeeded as an entertainer , he would be lost to them . For this very reason M islims do not court prominent Negroes . Cassius Clay was almost certainly a Muslim for a long time before he won the heavyweight boxing championship and it was no longer possible to hide his membership . To me , Louis X is a tragic figure . He had the talent to become a leading figure in the entertainment world . He put aside all personal ambition because he believed the Muslims were trying to instill in the Negro a sense of pride and a hope for accomplishment . Not . I should say , that he was starving . Louis was drawing a salary of $110 a week and was living rent-free in a big house alongside the mosque . Each member was supposed to . donate $2.95 a week toward Louis 's upkeep , which means that if 100 members were contributing regularly he was receiving another $15,000 a year in expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the mosque . The other two officials  --  the captain , who is the military leader , and the secretary , who takes care of the finances  --  were sup posed to be supported by frequent contributions from the membership . But in addition to those contributions , the captain received $85 a week from the administration funds , and the secretary got $35 . Once I made the decision to join the Nation of Islam , I threw myself into the movement with complete dedication . On my first night as a member I stood up before the orientation class and said , " 1 came from a large family . 1 had eight brothers and I felt very close to all of them . But as much as I loved my family brothers , I value this brotherhood even more , because you are the brothers I have chosen . " And I meant every word of it . I came in with the understanding that a special position as liaison between the minister , captain and secretary would be created for me , making me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual wasted six weeks in orientation class . I immediately became the secretary of the Fruit of Islam . One of the countless misconceptions of the press is that the Fruit of Islam is a special unit , a sort of honor guard . It is not . The Fruit of Islam is the whole male membership . As soon as you become a full-fledged Muslim . you become  --  and this is the term that is used  --  a Fruit . The Muslims did do one thing for me . In obedience to the laws of Islam I gave up drinking . The second thing I gave up was my overtime at the post office . With my temple duties I simply could n't work extra hours . The Fruit had to attend temple meetings of one kind or another on Monday . Wednesday , Friday and Saturday evenings , plus an afternoon meeting on Sunday . That did n't mean we had Tuesday and Thursday nights to ourselves , though . On those two nights , as well as on Saturday and Sunday mornings , we were supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muhammad Speaks . As an official , I did n't have to worry about hawking papers , but I did have my duties as secretary of the Fruit of Islam . To get to my desk on time , I would report to my job at the post office at six A.m. so that I could check out by 2:30 , rush to the temple and remain until midnight . This hardly left me time for the rich family life the Muslims are supposed to be promoting . It barely left me enough time to eke out a living . In the 12 months before I became a Muslim , I had earned $7,200 . In my first year as a Muslim I earned $5,200 . Out of that sum Ruth and I were donating about $1,000 to the temple . We had to give up our home . We sold the 1959 Chevrolet and bought a 1949 Chevrolet . And , strange as it seems , we did it gladly . Yet my career as a Muslim turned out to be a succession of disillusionments as , one by one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every claim to be an illusion . The Myth of Numbers The Muslims have managed to impress themselves upon the nation 's consciousness as a powerful and vital and growing movement . To create the illusion of strength , the leadership always mustered almost the full national Muslim force in every city where the Honorable Elijah Muhammad was to speak . If there was a meeting in Detroit for instance , we in Boston were ordered to charter a couple of buses and arrive in Detroit with almost our full membership . The same order would go out to all the mosques in the country . There would also be a good many curiosity seekers . If the newspapermen covering the affair wanted to assume we were all local members , we did nothing to discourage them . And yet , even with the curiosity seekers and busloads of members from eastern cities , we had trouble getting 3,000 into the Boston Arena ( capacity THE MUSLIM FRAUD 7,000 ) . Chicago , the center of the movement , had to strain to get 10.000 . Only New York could approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody with ease . The leaders of the responsible Negro organizations should know better , vet many are so certain that the Muslims represent a force to be reckoned with that they feel it necessary to put in an appearance at these meetings , Lake a bow and wave to the assemblage . How large was our membership ? The most accurate estimate I ever heard of our strength in Boston came during a radio debate between Gordon Hall , a specialist on extremist organizations , and Malcolm X , who was the symbol of the Muslims for most people until he broke with the movement in March . 1964 . Hall is the only outsider I know of who was not fooled by the Muslim myths . He told Malcolm X that we were lucky if we had 1,000 members throughout New England . Malcolm , needless to say , treated Hall 's estimate with contempt ; other estimates ran over 3,000 . In point of fact , the greatestnumber of men we ever had in Boston was 110 , with perhaps another 125 women . The male membership of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Springfield , Mass. , our other tower of strength in New England , has never had more than 50 members . Providence reached a high mark of 18 . Worcester . Mass. , as far as I know , had a husband-and-wife team who never quite managed to recruit anybody else . When Dr. C. Eric Lincoln wrote what was supposed to be a definitive book on the Nation of Islam in 1961 , he stated that our national membership had reached 100,000 and was growing rapidly , and that we confidently expected to reach five million by 1964 . Louis Lomax , who has probably had closer contact with the movement than any other Negro writer , wrote only two years ago that " the state of the Nation of Islam is goad ; its population is growing , its economy is in the black . " I have been to every big city where we have a mosque and , giving the Muslims all the best of it , I would say that the national membership  --  men , women and children  --  runs less than 7,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1960-61 . The population is not growing . It is collapsing . The Myth of Education My main interest in the movement was its educational program . I had been told about the University of Islam in Chicago , that great institution through which the Muslims were educating and elevating a whole generation of Negroes . So eager was I to become a part of this great undertaking that I was trying to rearrange my schedule so that I could return to college , get my teaching certificate , and teach at the University of Islam . The great disillusionment came the following February , 11 months after I had joined , when we went to Chicago to attend our first national convention . While we were driving by the Chicago mosque , one Muslim called out , " There 's the university . " I did n't see any university . All I saw was a small , low building . " What 's that ? " I asked . " The administration office ? " It was , of course , the whole university . The University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went through it later and it contained , as I remember , eight rooms . It did have a smattering of high-school students , Out their credits were not accepted by any college . The graduating classes have about six students . I was stunned . Throughout the rest of the weekend I kept muttering to Ruth , " But that ca n't be the university . It ca n't be . " Having given up on the University of Islam as the Negro 's great hope for intellectual advance , I decided to try to start a Muslim parochial-school system in Boston . Minister Louis whipped off a letter to Chicago asking for permission to proceed , but permission was denied . The hierarchy reminded us of its grand new plans for building a $20 million center in Chicago which would include , among its other glories , " a two-story structure which will house the best possible teaching facilities . science laboratories and gymnasium .... " Chicago had , in fact , " already instituted a " call " to raise the $20 million  --  a call being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member is supposed to , and had better , make to the temple every month . A brochure had already been sent around showing drawings of beautiful glass-and-stone buildings . The land had already been purchased , Chicago informed us , construction was about to begin , and we in Boston could hardly expect to indulge ourselves in our own school system when the same money could be used to build a university that would serve the entire Nation of Islam . Unfortunately the center in Chicago never did move off the pages of the brochure . After more than three million dollars reportedly had been collected , we were told that the city of Chicago had taken the land away from us for a playground . To my knowledge no accounting of the money was ever given , and no further talk of the center was ever heard . To ask about the So steep was Barnette 's tithe to the airmails money was out of the question . Even to question a Muslim official labels a member as a " seed planter , " a breed we were constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the center have never been revived , possibly because Muhammad has been so busy working on those plans of his for a great business empire . " The Negro can make jobs for himself , " Muhammad has written . " Twenty million Negroes have a combined purchasing power of over twenty billion dollars . . . . No other race of people in the world would allow twenty billion dollars to pass through its hands yearly without adding power and prestige to itself . " My disillusionment with Islam 's business empire came during my first visit to Chicago as a Muslim . I had heard about the modern communal businesses , but all I saw were a small bakery ; a small grocery store ; a small restaurant ; a small cleaning establishment ; a small clothing store ; a small barbershop , and a small dress factory . Although the dress " factory " had only a few machines and a mere handful of employees , it was the one business that might have been making a substantial amount of money . By coincidence it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but by Muhammad 's daughter . It would be difficult for the factory not to make money , since it has a completely captive market . A few months after I joined the mosque , all the sisters were told that in order to dress with the modesty expected of a Muslim sister they would have to wear special robes descending to their ankles . There were five basic colors , and it was mandatory that the sisters buy a minimum of three  --  white , beige and red  --  at a cost of $200 for the set . In Boston we did have a string of service-type businesses . One of Minister Louis'sgreat boasts was that our mosque had 52 businessmen as members . What I failed to see at first was that while all these men owned businesses when they joined , many no longer did . If being a Muslim is the only road to the Hereafter , it also seems the quickest road to bankruptcy . An example is the case of Edward and Robert Wise . two brothers who owned a small furniture store . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were instructed to patronize the brothers ' store . As soon as the brothers did join , however , most of the Muslim customers disappeared , leaving their bills unpaid . That was just the beginning . Once Edward and Robert became Muslims , they could po longer keep their store open at night , since they had to attend meetings four nights a week . And when it was learned that both brothers were skilled painters and carpenters , they were put to work fixing up the minister 's house . Their income dropped sharply , yet they still had to contribute large amounts to the mosque . Soon they had to give up their furniture store . The Myth of Brotherhood Muslims claim that Negroes , set at each other 's throats by white society , come to live in harmony in the allMot he had to nett his JO-room bonne. black Nation of Islam . Nothing in my career as a Muslim bears out this claim . The principal agent of discord in the Boston mosque is an ex-addict named Clarence W.X , the captain of the Fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squad Clarence runs the F.0.1. as a tight military organization . A stocky ma , f medium height , with closely crud hair and a thick roll of flesh at the back of his neck , he looks like an ex-middleweight boxer . He is arrogant , suspicious , dictatorial . An ordinary member is not permitted to speak to him directly but must go through channels . Even then it does little good . He shouts down every complaint . " The men should not be allowed to talk back to you , " he once told his lieutenants . " It reflects disrespect for me and those in authority over me . If they grumble , bring them to me on charges . " On another occasion he told them , " Do not whip the men . Only I have the right to whip the men . " F.0.1. meetings are a two-hour mishmash of drill . hygiene lectures , current-events briefings , pep talks , physical exercise and miscellaneous instruction . In the final half hour the captain harangues the troops . Clarence loved to tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He always ended his harangue with the warning that the FBI had succeeded in placing a spy ? " yes , one of our own black brothers " ? right there in our midst . I could never quite understand what an FBI agent could possibly learn at a Fruit meeting . and I suggested to Captain Clarence at one point that he really ought to knock that stuff off . " All you 're doing , " I said innocently , " is breeding suspicion and distrust among the brothers . " Captain Clarence balefully observed that perhaps the reason I wanted to silence him was because I was an FBI spy myself . Since the ranks are supposedly teeming with spies and traitors , the captain quite obviously has a duty to keep every member under surveillance . To aid him he has an official " investigator , " whose job is to dig up evidence against those who have violated the Muslim laws . There are so many petty rules that the assignment keeps the investigator aid his staff hopping . Asa rule of thumb , any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking a Muslim law . THE MUSLIM FRAUD A Muslim is not supposed to go to a movie , a dance , or any other entertainment . Television is frowned on . He may attend a wedding , but only if it is a Muslim wedding . Tremendous pressure was put on my wife and me not to attend my brother 's wedding . first , because he was not a Muslim ( which meant I was n't supposed to associate with him at all ) , but also because a wedding is entertainment . We did go , and we were not brought up on charges only because I was still being given special privileges . We had an assistant minister who was not so privileged . Seen going into a movie , he was defrocked and suspended . It is the duty of every member to spy upon and inform on every other member . Once Captain Clarence received information that the brother and brother-in-law of Minister Louis 's wife had entered the YAI.C.A. , which is as out-of-bounds as a Muslim can possibly get . The investigator discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularly to study the self-defense technique called karate . Clarence concluded that if they were secretly studying karate it could only be for use against the Muslims . The two men were hustled down to the basement of the mosque for questioning while a temple meeting was in progress . Instead of confessing , however . they insisted that they had only been trying to find out whether karate was worth teaching to the rest of the F.O.I . Clarence did n't believe them and had his lieutenants beat them . When one of the two . Richard X , began to cry out in pain . he was ordered Lobe quiet . Clarence pointed out sternly that since his cries could be heard in the temple , they indicated a lack of respect for the minister  --  Richard 's own brother-in-law . And so Richard submitted to the pummeling without any further outcries . He really did n't want to disturb the mosque meeting . Both suspects were suspended for 90 days , and the case was sent on to Chicago for Elijah Muhammad 's tin judgment . The report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided that karate Should be taught in all the mosques . So both men were quietly reinstated and given special positions  --  as karate instructors . Most of my time as F.O.I . secretary was spent typing up the charges against seed planters . Trial night came only once a month , but it was a rare trial night when we did n't have at least two or three brothers in the dock . The captain would stand on the rostrum Under the Muslim flag la red flag with cres cent and star ) . The accused was brought ' in between two guards , the three of them marching down the aisle in single file , As they reached the front of the temple . the accused would step out to the right . salute the captain smartly , execute an about-face and exclaim to the assembled members : " As-salaamalaikum . " At this point I would come forward , read the charge , and ask the accused how he wished to plead . It was futile to make any plea but guilty . A major assignment for Clarence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell the biweekly newspaper , Muhammad Speaks ( edited by a non-Muslim ) . The pressure was tremendous . Elijah Muhammad Jr . once told us , " The Brotherhood of Islam is engaged in the business of raising the dead , selling Muhammad Speaks , and obeying the laws of Islam . " But , listening to the minister and the captain make sales pitches for the paper , you could n't help thinking that the sole purpose of the Muslim movement was to sell newspapers . With its unpaid newsboys and captive customers , the paper must have been very profitable . All money from its sale went directly to Chicago . When I first came into the mosque , the paper cost 15 cents , and each member was required to take 200 copies and to pay for them whether or not he sold them . This meant that in addition to the regular contributions and the special assessments , he had to find $60 a month just for the newspapers . Few members came anywhere near their quota . Most - of them did n't sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were struggling just to put food on the table , I was often distressed to find unsold newspapers stacked in their closets and in their cellars and in the trunks of their cars . The mosque began to have as much trouble collecting from the brothers as the brothers had in selling the paper . Finally , a new policy was announced . The price was raised to 20 cents and , in what was supposed to be an attempt to promote initiative , the salesman was to keep three cents for himself . That three-cent commission turned out to be a fraud . Clarence directed that the three cents be returned to the mosque . Under the new policy the pressure to sell papers was applied more strongly than ever . The dunning was constant . When a brother fell too far behind , members of the terror squad would pay him a night visit . If he still would n't  --  or could n't  --  get up the money , they would invite him out for a ride , drive him to Franklin Park and work him over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take time away from their already neglected businesses in order to become newsboys , and since they were also presumed to be the most able to meet their obligations , it was the businessmen who came to take the brunt of the beatings . And right here was the rock on which the Boston mosque broke . The businessmen , having been their own bosses , had a sense of their own dignity . They refused to submit themselves to the humiliation of a beating . The conflict came to a head in the fall of 1962 . We were told that Elijah Muhammad Jr. , the assistant supreme captain and chief troubleshooter , was coming to Boston to listen to the disaffected brothers ' complaints and to try to bring peace and tranquillity to our troubled mosque . Elijah Muhammad Jr . came , all right , but he made it very clear very quickly that he had not come either to appease the membership or to censure Captain Clarence . His opening words were , ' " The issue here is the paper . You just do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the businessmen . The charge they have on you is right . . . If you do n't want to sell the paper , then do n't even bother to come in here . I 'm the judge tonight , and you are guilty . " And then , to nail it down , he reminded us that in the old days recalcitrant brothers were killed . " And the Messenger , " he said , " fulfills all . " In Muslim jargon that meant it was written in the book that in the future , too , some would be killed . Having spread his message of brotherly love . Elijah Muhammad Jr . returned to Chicago . Within the next few days , 42 businessmen quit the Boston mosque . During this same period of time I was working as secretary for a subcommittee that had been formed in my neighborhood to protest against police brutality . As a matter of policy , the Muslims refuse to work with any other Negro organizations , and they were not very happy about my efforts to help non-Muslims . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " bourgeois Negro , " the Muslims ' worst epithet . Since I seemed to have so much time on my hands , he told me , I was going to have to sell my quota of newspapers just like anybody else . He was trying to force me to quit the neighborhood committee , I knew . Instead , I simply wrote a letter early in 1963 saying that I was so unhappy with the way things were going that I felt it best to stay away from the mosque for a while , lest my unhappiness infect the others . In November the male membership was down to a pitiful 45 , and Minister Louis invited all who had left to return under a general amnesty . Clarence was out , he said , and things were going to improve . Clarence was out ? We could hardly believe it . Nor were we any less incredulous when we heard that the reason for his ouster was woman trouble . Clarence just had n't seemed interested in women . Other officials of the mosque were married , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait and to be married in the Hereafter . What had happened was that Clarence had married . and the marriage had collapsed after only three days . Minister Louis told us that Chicago had removed Clarence from office for this failure to provide a glittering example of marital success . As weary and disillusioned as many of us were , most of those who had quit showed up at the next Friday-night meeting . Louis promised that the newspaper quotas would be dropped and the heavy discipline would end . But the truth was that Clarence had not been cast down . He had merely been directed to stay away until his marital problems were straightened out . The following Wednesday I went to see Louis and found him badly shaken . Clarence had written to the Muslim leaders in Chicago , informing them of Louis 's promises of leniency . Chicago then had ordered Louis to hold to the old line . Louis folded completely . Two days later he mounted the rostrum and said : " Some of you seem to have misunderstood me . " And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in force . That was it . When I walked out that night I knew that I would never return . I was broke . I had lost everything I had worked to accumulate before 1 became a Muslim . But at last I had shaken myself out of the lunatic , fairytale world of blue-eyed devils and divine-sent Messengers . I was back in the real world . The real awakening came a couple of months later when a woman on my mail route asked me if I would answer some questions for a survey she was conducting . We soon discovered that we were both Boston University graduates . With a degree in business administration , " she asked me , " what in the world are you doing delivering mail ? " And for the first time in years I asked myself the same question . What was I doing delivering mail ? The Muslims had hammered away so hard at the message that there was no hope for a Negro in white society that I had subconsciously written off all hope myself . The woman took me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a good friend of hers . He made an appointment for me , for two weeks from then . But that night , discussing the whole thing with my wife Ruth , I decided not to wait two weeks but to strike out immediately for myself . The next afternoon I presented myself to Jobs Clearing House , an organization that attempts to place qualified Negroes in the business community . I was sent to a bank , interviewed , and placed in the bank 's management-training program . Nine months later I received that beating in broad daylight by the 13 Muslim goons . The story behind the beating begins in a weird way  --  with a reported attempt by supporters of Elijah Muhammad to kill Malcolm X. Having been thrown out of the Nation of Islam by Elijah Muhammad , Malcolm was spreading word in the Negro community that Muhammad had a couple of paternity suits pending against him . Malcolm had been scheduled to hold a meeting in Boston last June , and I decided to attend . But , to my disappointment , he sent four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meeting , as they were driving through a tunnel on the way back to the airport , another car cut them off and , according to reports , several men leaped out , their guns drawn . Instead of finding Malcolm , they found his four associates , one of whom had a shotgun resting on his knees . That would have been the end of that , except for one thing : When Malcolm 's men arrived at the airport , they went walking through the concourse carrying the shotgun right out in the open , a fairly good way of coming to the attention of the police . I had come to the Malcolm X meeting with John Thimas and a taxi owner , also an ex-Muslim , for whom I wasdoing tax work . Afterward the taxi owner had to pick up one of his drivers who was about to go off duty at the airport , and through that coincidence we found ourselves driving into the airport perhaps 15 minutes after the police had been called . When we arrived , the police were still picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant almost any Negro . We were taken to the police station . Since we were booked , we had to appear in court to get our case dismissed . The case kept being postponed , however ( Malcolm 's alleged attackers were eventually acquitted ) , and in July , as I was walking out of the courtroom after one of the postponements . I saw the Boston mosque 's investigator and a couple of his boys across the street . One of them was pointing a movie camera at me . " We are going to make you a star at the next F.O.I . meeting , " the investigator called to me . Obviously the Muslims thought I had seen what had happened in the tunnel and had come to court to testify against them . And that was apparently one reason why they pounced upon me in August and sent me to the hospital . From my hospital bed I discovered that none of the Muslim goons had been arrested . The police told me they could n't make an arrest until I filed a complaint . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wanted to make any arrests out of fear of starting a riot . It was a perfect example of the exaggerated notion the public has of Muslim strength and power . I had told my employers at the bank about my career as a Muslim . and so when I was beaten they were understanding instead of outraged ; they assured my wife that my pay would continue throughout my recovery . Once I could move about again , I went to see Gordon Hall , the specialist on extremist groups who knew the truth about the Muslims . Hall told me that by vigorously pressing charges against my assailants  --  one of whom was Clarence X-1 would help publicize the fraud of Islam and save other Negroes from making my mistake . I therefore swore out complaints for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon . At the hearing the Muslims ' lawyer said his clients were pleading not guilty upon instrucLions from Chicago . In mid-January , nine were found guilty of assault and two , including Clarence , were convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of assault have been sworn out by ex-Muslims in Chicago , Philadelphia , New York and Los Angeles . and the FBI was anxious to know whether I thought all these beatings were taking place on orders from Chicago . In the Chicago case the Muslims pleaded not guilty and were sentenced to 18 months in jail . If the Muslim strong-arm men did plead guilty , not only would it amount to an admission that beatings are taking place ; it also might well establish a pattern clear enough for the Justice Department to hang a conspiracy rap on the top officials in Chicago . And the Nation of Islam is in enough trouble already . The city of Boston has challenged its right to a tax exemption as a religion and has already moved to seize its property to satisfy back taxes . In January , Akbar Muhammad became the second of Muhammad 's sons to renounce him publicly . And , of course , the Honorable Elijah has those paternity suits still hanging over him . If the press and public officials will see the Black Muslim movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding on the frustrations and the ignorance of American Negroes  --  its influence will dwindle to what it was before Malcolm X inflated it to such enormous proportions . And if the Negroes will understand that the Muslims are all talk and no action  --  that they can condemn , complain and criticize , but can not deliver on any of their promises  --  then the Nation of Islam will disappear completely . To the white man the Black Muslims have been only a minor annoyance . To the Negro , and this is the final tragedy , they have been another foot on the back , another knock on the door , another ride in the darkness , another beating  --  yes , another slave master , Perhaps it is the nature of a hate movement that it becomes the very thing it preaches against . ? 29
