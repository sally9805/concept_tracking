After eight months of political bickering , Peru last week had its first major land-reform program . The sensible new law is a patient compromise of three different bills introduced by President Fernando Belaunde Terry and two major opposition parties . <P> Rather than give the government unlimited expropriation powers , the legislation scrupulously exempts the large , highly mechanized coastal sugar holdings and efficiently run highland livestock ranches that are vital to Peru 's economy . Instead , it aims mainly at haciendas of 3,000 acres and up that do not pay their way , are either uncultivated or marginally productive under present ownership . The landholders-whether private citizens , companies or the Roman Catholic Church-will be paid fair market value for their expropriated land in cash and 18-to 22-year bonds bearing 4% to 6% tax-free interest ; livestock , buildings and equipment will be paid for in cash . <P> By utilizing state-owned land along with the expropriated acres , President Belaunde hopes to eventually settle 1,000,000 landless peasants on their own farms , giving up to 32 acres to a family in rich coastal areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the program is carried out successfully , the change will be dramatic . Most of the country 's arable land has been concentrated in the hands of a few wealthy hacienda owners ever since colonial days ; the peasants either worked as sharecroppers or scratched a bare living out of their own tiny plots , often no larger than a single furrow . Today a peasant 's life expectancy is only 32 years , and his income is about $110 annually . To get maximum effect from the new law , which goes into effect next month , the government set up separate agencies offering credit and technical assistance to the new landowners .
