On the 18th green at Chicago 's Olympia Fields Country Club , in the uncertain twilight , Carl Jerome Barber squinted cautiously down the shaft of his putter at the ball . A long 60 ft. stretched between him and the cup , and Dallas Pro Don January , 31 , would take the P.G.A . first money if Barber missed . Barber did n't miss . He sank his putt and a tie was his . In the play-off next day , holing long putts with fresh assurance . Jerry Barber finished one stroke ahead of January to become , at 45 , the oldest and smallest golfer ever to win the P.G.A . tournament . <P> It was his hot putter that did it . In 90 holes at Olympia Fields , he three-putted not a single green . Barber , a scrawny little fellow-5 ft. 5 in. , 137 Ibs. - turned pro at 24 after licking every amateur around the Jacksonville , Ill. farm where he was raised . Recognizing his physical disadvantages . Jerry Barber patiently fitted himself for the game . He built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight lifting and calisthenics , spent hours exercising with a homemade contraption-a lo-lb. weight tied to a broom handle . Wherever he played for the money , he painstakingly stalked the course first , making observations and carefully noting down the pitch of every green . <P> He did passably well as a money player - $18,865 in 1955 , $21,909 last year-but never quite made it to the top . In the 1959 P.G.A . at Minneapolis , he faltered and bogied the last two holes , dropped into a tie for second behind San Francisco 's Bob Rosburg . Last year Barber 's putter carried him to victory in the Las Vegas Tournament of Champions . But he wanted the P.G.A . and last week got it , along with the $11,000 first money . All the hard years now seem worthwhile . " I 'm still enthusiastic about golf , " says Barber , " but I 'm just beginning to learn what it 's all about . "
