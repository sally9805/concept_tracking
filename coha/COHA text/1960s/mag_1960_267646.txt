Neither Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd nor any member of his Cabinet has ever set foot in the Negro-ruled new states of Africa , but this does not prevent South Africa 's confident Prime Minister from speaking for the millions who populate them . " The mass of Africans do not want independence , " he assured his Parliament last week . " They are just being used by a few small groups of Africans who are really considering their own interests . " In the same building six weeks before , Britain 's Harold Macmillan had warned of the " wind of change " sweeping the continent and of Britain 's sympathies with nationalist aims . To Verwoerd , who edited a pro-Nazi newspaper during World War II and might have been expected to choose his historical comparisons more carefully , Macmillan 's attitude smacked of Munich-like appeasement . " The West is abdicating in Africa and leaving the white man in the lurch , " he complained . " It is robbing the black masses of training and all the advantages the white man brought to this dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mohammedanism . " If inexperienced African leaders of new countries flood the United Nations , Verwoerd added , the West will have to withdraw from the organization . <P> South Africa , said Verwoerd , will welcome whites who flee from lands that come under African rule , " because they . . . are the best immigrants , " but his country would never surrender to the black tide . Apartheid was the only way Verwoerd saw , and he begged the opposition United Party to rally behind his policies in toto . He was to be disappointed in this , but could claim another victory of sorts last week . The South African government 's Bantu Education department ruled that its officials no longer may shake hands with Africans they meet on official business . To get around any awkward encounters , they should employ " traditional " greetings to blacks-say , a hand raised in salute or , when squatting in tribal parley , the clapping of hands .                   @ @
