A funny thing happened on the 20th Century Limited . On its way to Chicago last week for its final run , the crack New York Central passenger express was delayed by a derailment up the track , wound up at its destination nine hours late . That is the way things have been going for trains recently and not just for real ones either . Toy electric trains , the very symbol of Christmas for generations of middle-class American boys , have gradually been losing customers too . <P> Once , the first boy on the block to get one turned his neighborhood pals green with envy . No other gift mattered quite so much or so involved Dad on Christmas morning . And after the train had arrived , parents Christmas shopping was simplified for years to come . No need to guess what Junior really wanted next time around . He wanted more new cars , more track , newer bridges , bigger tunnels , switches and signals until the basement recreation room could hold no more . <P> But for today 's youngsters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and may never even have ridden in a train , the tracks are losing thier magic . Lionel , which has absorbed A.C. Gilbert 's American Flyer this year stopped stopped making trains and is selling off its inventory . Sears Roebuck 's current Christmas catalogue devotes tow pages to model trains-but it takes nine pages to describe slot-car racing sets , which provide an element of competition that the trains never had , and have replaced them as the Christmas present that boys want most . <P> For girls a generation ago , the most hoped-for present at the top of Santa 's bag was a doll . It still is . But nowadays , helped by batteries , every Jack and Jill must be capable of doing its own thing . " Baby Crawl-Along " lives up to her name , scoots across the floor on hands and knees . No sooner does " Tubsy " touch the bath water than she starts splashing . Tubsy is an angel compared with " Li'l Miss Fussy " ; she dampens her diapers , then throws a tantrum , crying and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hungry " is more patient ; she will go unfed indefinitely . Once the spoon or nursing bottle is inserted between her lips , however , she rolls her eyes and downs her formula with gusto . But , caution : when she sits up after meals , she wets .
