Fewer and fewer Americans , about one out of three , live in the great outdoors now celebrated almost entirely in never-ever television westerns . In a curious miracle of abandonment , Americans have become strangers in a landscape that they believe has built their national character . But not all . North of Alamogordo and east of Tularosa , south of Hondo and only six miles crow flight from an Apache reservation-in the dusty desolation of New Mexico-Artist Peter Kurd works in a perpetual state of wonderment . <P> A native regional realist of the Southwest , equally prized by Lyndon B. Johnson and Barry Goldwater , Kurd , now 60 , is trying to preserve the look of a fading way of U.S. life . Like his brother-in-law , Andrew Wyeth , he finds all his subject matter , says he , " within five miles of my home . " His ranch , The Sentinel , ranges over 2,200 acres where he raises cattle and , in less arid parts , apples , peaches and pears . It is not a big spread by Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Never High Noon . " A painters life is determined by daylight , " says Hurd , who knocks back an unvarying breakfast of eggnog , toast and coffee at sunup , then goes riding across the juniper-knobby hills . He may dismount , whip out a tiny watercolor set and sketch a bit of his domain . These glimpses are pulled together in his studio , where Hurd toils in the meticulous technique of egg tempera . The results , recently on view at Fort Worth 's Amon Carter Museum of Western Art and opening last week in San Francisco 's California Palace of the Legion of Honor , is an exhibition of 98 paintings that documents nearly 35 years of the artist 's minute observations of the world he knows best ( see color ) . <P> Hurd rarely paints high noon . " All phases of light , its constantly changing patterns , thrill me , " he says . With each painting , he increases his dissection of his skeletal landscape through the hours and seasons of the sun . " I feel like shouting This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Hurd . One of the few times he ventured abroad was as a LIFE artist-correspondent during World War II . Friends urge him to travel , but he says , " Nuts . I 'd be painting postcards . " <P> Jehovah 's Witness . Though Hurd was born in New Mexico , he has Eastern ties . His father was a Boston lawyer who settled in dry New Mexico for his health . Hurd attended West Point for two years , quit because art interested him more than mathematics . He recalls that his father-apparently ignorant of the aborted West Point career of James McNeill Whistler-responded by saying , " You are an utter jackass . " <P> The young artist 's idol was the lusty illustrator , N. C. Wyeth ; one fateful day the grand old man telephoned him . " It was like the Lord Jehovah calling , " says Hurd . <P> " If you work for me , " announced Wyeth , " West Point will seem like child 's play . " On the train to Wyeth 's famous colony at Chadds Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. 's daughter Henriette , then 16 , and now an accomplished artist herself . N. C. taught Moby Dick and Dostoevsky as well as painting . " He was a terrific stickler for detail , " recalls Hurd , who became fast friends with Andrew Wyeth during his six-year apprenticeship . " We have in common the ability to identify ourselves with objects , " says he .
