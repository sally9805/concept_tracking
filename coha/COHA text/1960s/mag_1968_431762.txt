 | The Truth About Auto Insurance A wave of discontent is mounting among the nation 's motorists over our system of auto insurance ? an item that has become almost indispensable to anyone who owns a car . A quick audit of your past bills will indicate why ? premiums have skyrocketed as much as 30 percent in the past six years . But cost is only part of the story , as illustrated by these complaints that have been raining in on Congressional investigating committees and government agencies . ? A Westchester County , N.Y. , man who had a spotless driving record for 30 years was forced into a high-cost assignedrisk plan ( explained later on ) when his auto-insurance company dropped him because it decided to stop writing policies in his area . ? A motorist in a Southern city had his premium raised by $200 annually when he added his son to his auto-insurance policy . is An elderly Midwesterner , after 30 years of coverage by the same auto-insurance company , had his policy canceled when he reached the age of 70 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that he could only get auto insurance through an assigned-risk plan upon discharge . His company told him all veterans were placed in the assigned-risk category . ? When a woman attempted to include her 16-year-old son , who had taken a high-school driver-education course , in her auto-insurance policy , her agent said she would have to buy a fire-insurance policy , too , from the company . Are these just occasional happen .. where something goes awry ? Or is insurance a jungle in which the consumer is prey to spiraling premiums , arbitrary rejections and cancellations , non- , newal of policies , and rate discrimination against the too-young , the too-old. the too-risky motorist ? Or is the industry a maligned sea goat , caught in an inflationary vise t : prevents it from operating profitably . it claims ? Despite rising sales ? the industry is clecting $9.2 billion in premiums compar with $6.4 billion in 1962 ? auto-insura companies are just as unhappy about t situation as their customers . Indust spokesmen say profits are dwindling because of greater claims payments cause by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for injury , death , and damage is also costlier , in surance men say . But the industry is extremely sensitiv e to its critics in spite of its own financial dissatisfaction , and is doing a lot to cle tit its own house . Many companies have - taken major steps to halt abuses , give consumers security in their insurance and speed up payments of claims to accident victims . Many companies have adopted a vc untary code assuring policyholders that insurance will not be canceled except f nonpayment of premiums or suspension of their driver 's license . One company Allstate , has given its policyholders the industry 's first long-term security guarantee ? a five-year noncancelable policy . Much consumer dissatisfaction persists , however , and the time for voluntary reforms may be running out . President Johnson , last May , signed a bill that launched a two-year probe by the Depart-@# @#  | nt of Transportation into the practices the giant industry . But do you have to wait for two years fore you can improve your own auto urance and possibly save money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked than 10 miles each way , with unmarried teen-age male ( no driver training ) as occasional driver . with leading insurance executives and government investigators . Their advice is that the average motorist can save substantially by careful shopping and tailoring of his insurance to suit his individual needs . Here 's what you should know to go about tailoring a policy for adequate protection and greatest economy . There are two basic types of auto insurance : ? Liability insurance , which protects you against financial loss when you hit - omeone or damage someone else 's car or property with your auto . Liability consists of bodily injury coverage and property-damage insurance to cover damages to other cars or property . ? Physical-damage insurance , which covers damage to your car . No sensible driver should be without liability insurance . Three states , Massachusetts , New York , and North Carolina , have compulsory liability-insurance laws . But it is a virtual necessity almost everywhere else because most other states forbid you to drive unless you can show financial responsibility if you have caused a serious accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't carry insurance up to the minimum standards before an accident or a serious conviction , chances are slim that you 'll be able to get coverage afterwards . So to satisfy the financial-responsibility @#  | laws in your state , you would have to post a personal bond for an amount sufficient to meet any damage claims against you , or lose your license . Putting up that much money could wipe out your savings or cause you to lose your home . To avoid such financial catastrophe , about 90 percent of all drivers carry liability insurance , according to the Insurance Information Institute . What do you get when you buy liability coverage ? The company will make good ( up to policy limits ) any claims from a collision with another person , his car , or his property . And it will become your barrier against any suits that result from such collisions . How much liability coverage do you need ? Insurance companies break the coverage down into bodily injury coverage for each person injured in an accident , a total limit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So if you buy a policy with 5/10/5 limits , for instance , you 're buying coverage against claims of up to $5,000 per person injured in an accident , $10,000 maximum for all persons injured per accident , and up to $5,000 for all property damage for which you are found to be legally liable . The limits you carry should be determined by your financial worth . A spokes- man for State Farm Mutual , the not largest auto insurer , says its typical p is 10/20/10 . An official of the d ernment Employes Insurance Corn ( GEICO ) says everybody should ry at least 20/40 coverage for bodil jury protection . The chance of your getting into a tion in which you could be held liable payments over the limits of your is highly unlikely , PS learned . Insurance experts say that settlements exeeding policy limits are unusual , but accurate statistics are available . New York , one of the three statea compulsory liability-insurance h calls for minimum coverage of 10 20 But earlier this year , Governor Nelson Rockefeller 's administration asked state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic i social conditions . " Frank Harway actuary for the State Insurance I partment , told a legislative hearing tl jury awards in deaths and major injury almost always " exceed the present statory limits . " This does n't mean that n torists wind up paying more than the limits . He said that in many cases it not possible for the injured person collect full payment . The legislature c not , however , increase the mandator minimums . You 'll find in checking with your company that you can probably increase your limits above the minimum at relatively small cost . And if you hose reason to protect yourself against a large loss , it 's a good idea to increase your minimums . For instance , if you have to pay $75 for 10/20/5 limits in your area . here 's what increased limitwould cost : 25/50/5 ? $87.50 50/100/10 ? $92.50 100/300/25 ? $100 Property-damage coverage is one item on which . many policyholders are insufficiently covered . If you turned over a truck or bus worth $25,000 , you might find yourself with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protects you m our antagonistic legal system , which mands that the person at fault in an aclent be held liable . If you have an accint and the other fellow is at fault , you n't collect from your own insurance company , but from the other party 's commy . If you 're at fault in an accident , your liability coverage protects you from possible financial ruin by paying the other river for his injuries and damages . It does not compensate you for your own injuries or damages . Here is the coverage you need : Medical-payments insurance covers your medical bills if you 're injured while driving or if you 're struck by an auto . The amount you collect is limited to actual medical expenses , or the amount of the limit you buy if that is lower . It also covers members of your family or passengers in your car . With the cost of today 's medical and hospital services , you should probably buy at least $1,000 worth of this protection per person . What it costs in one area is shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $14 $5,000 $17 Medical payments also cover you and members of your family if you 're injured on a bus , or even as a pedestrian . @# Physical-damage insurance covers damages to your own car . This is broken up into two main types : ? Comprehensive physical-damage insurance . ? Collision insurance . Comprehensive pays for virtually any damage to your car , except that caused by collision . Fire , theft , and glass breakage are the principal coverages , but it also pays you for a host of other things . Suppose your car is parked in a riot area and is turned over and set afire by a mob . Comprehensive would pay you for any damages . Flood-damage insurance , which is almost impossible to get on your home , is part of your comprehensive policy . Your car is also covered for damage caused by explosions , earthquake , windstorm , hail , and falling objects . Comprehensive also protects you if your car is stolen . Your company will pay you $10 a day , for 30 days , for loss of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with transportation receipts to collect this , though . If your car is damaged while it is stolen , the damages will be paid by your comprehensive coverage . Suppose your car is stolen in Boston and is found abandoned in Los Angeles . Your company will pay your way out to Continued AUGUST 1968 103  | the city where it is found so you can recover it . Suppose you had driven to Los Angeles and the car was stolen there and you returned to Boston before it was found . Then you would have to pay your fare to Los Angeles to get your car back . You do n't have to take a car back if it is missing for more than 30 days , if you do n't want to . But you must take it back if it is found in less than 30 days . How much do you collect if your car is n't found ? You get the book value at the place where it was stolen . If your car is stolen in a town where it is worth more than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car is totally wrecked when it 's found , you collect the book value of the car computed at its worth city where it 's recovered . How much does comprehensive cost ? In most parts of the country , its under $25 a year . So it 's a good buy even if you have an old car . But in some parts of the country , the price of comprehensive can get very expensive , especially where a lot of paint damage is caused by sandstorms . Although a $50 deductible feature on comprehensive is available in most areas ? it cuts the cost by about half ? most people prefer to buy without it . Need Collision Insurance ? Collision insurance pays for any damages to your car that result from hitting another auto , or object , or from being turned over ? regardless of whether you are at fault . There are good odds that you wo n't ever need it , because in a great many instances drivers collect from the other fellow 's insurance company . What if you 're hit by an uninsured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident , or even have an accident in which no fault can be established ? Suppose you happen to skid into a tree or a barrier ? Then you 'd stand to collect nothing on damages to your car . If you ca n't afford to pick up a sizeable repair bill and your car is relatively new , you should buy collision coverage to protect yourself from a big financial loss . In fact , if you buy your car with an auto loan , the lender will probably insist that you buy it with no more than a $50 deductible . A word of caution , though . If you buy insurance through a car dealer , you may only be buying collision insurance . Make sure that you buy liability coverage , too . Full collision insurance is almost impossible to buy . But you can buy it with a variety of deductibles ? up to $500 . This means that you pay the first $50 to $500 , depending on your policy , of any collision damage to your car . The company pays for all damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Think carefully . This is an area in which you can get a great deal of protection and still save yourself lots of 104 POPULAR SCIENCE money if you self-insure up to an a you can afford to absorb yourself . should never insure yourself against loss you feel you can cover without hardship . Most people buy a $50-deductible collision policy because that 's all want to lose out of their own However , if you increase your deductible to , say $100 , you can save up to third the cost . A $250 deductible about 60 percent less than a $50 . You 'll find that collision premiums as your car ages and loses value . there comes a time when the cover is n't worth buying because the prem is too high compared with the value your car . Almost all insurance comp , : recommend that you drop collision insurance by the time your car is years old . One added benefit of collision ins once : Even when you 're not at fault an accident and are due to collect fr the other driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own company under the collision coverage . It will then col from the other company , and if it recovers the full amount , it will return y deductible amount to you . Trying to collect on your own can be a trying experience . With collision insurance , you . be sure of the speediest payment for y repair bill . But your company wo n't tempt to collect for any personal injury you receive in the accident . One prerequisite for the purchase  | collision insurance is that you also buy comprehensive . That 's because all glass damage is paid under comprehensive , even if it 's broken in a collision . One adantage to you in this feature is that it avoids your having to absorb a deductible for a broken windshield or door window . Insuring yourself against the uninsured motorist is one of the best buys you can Its cost is only a few dollars a year and in many states it is mandatory . In other states , you can be without it only if you sign a waiver refusing it . Uninsured-motorist coverage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're hit by an uninsured vehicleor by a hit-and-run driver . With uninsured-motorist coverage , your own company will pay you for the injuries or damages to your car that you would ordinarily get from the other driver 's insurance company . Do n't pass this up under any circumstances . Even if you live in a state where insurance is mandatory , you can be struck by an out-of-state driver who does n't carry insurance . Other coverages you may want to consider include emergency road service . It 's cheap and provides " first aid " for your car if it breaks down . It also pays for delivery of gas , oil , or tires if you 're stranded on the highway and need them . Choosing a Company With this information in hand , you 're now ready to shop around . There are many ways to buy auto insurance . You can get it with or without service , with or without agents , and at a great range of prices . How can this be when states regulate prices ? The fact is that regulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 47 states there is price competition . One of the three exceptions is Texas , which has a state insurance commission that requires all companies to charge the same premiums for the same coverage . Does this mean that you ca n't get it cheaper from some companies ? Even under such restrictive regulations , insurance companies have a pricing innovation that enables you to get a better buy from one than another . In Texas , many companies give you dividends at the end of every year . The size of the dividend determines your real cost . Many mutual companies throughout the U.S. pay dividends routinely , but in Texas the companies pay dividends as a means of competing on prices . What kind of company is for you ? There are two basic groups : ? Agency companies . ? Direct writers . The lines get blurred , however , when Continued  | you try to place some companies in their niche . The old-line agency companies sell their insurance through independent agents and brokers , who handle several different companies and get a higher commission on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers sell through exclusive agents . An exclusive agent is either an employee of an insurance company or virtually one . He gets a lower commission per sale than independent agents ? about 10 percent . Some direct writers , however , are strictly mail-order sellers and have no agents ' fees at all . How is this reflected in the cost of insurance to you ? If a company pays an agent a higher commission , it must be reflected in , its price to you . And generally direct sellers ' rates are cheaper than old-line agency rates . But the agency companies claim that you get better service from an independent agent than one who is a company employee . Having a strong agent can sometimes be a help in getting better service and consideration from an insurance corm. pany . In some instances , the independent agent can intercede more effectively ? the insurance company in pressing claim for you . If you should run into luck and get hit with a traffic violati or have an accident that results in a co pany dropping you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he represents several differe ones . Direct writers fight back at this char and claim they can equal or excel t- , - service you get from the old-line companies . The direct writers have set u drive-in claims offices and have represe tatives in convenient shopping centers service policyholders . Which should you pick ? If you fee ! you do n't need someone to represent you in dealing with your company , take advantage of the savings direct writers generally offer ? if you qualify . If you feel that you 'd rather pay a little more and have someone who might give you additional service and be more effective in dealing with your insurance company . then an independent agent may be worth the extra cost . Can You Get Insurance ? Maryland is where the insurance controversy first hit the headlines a couple of years ago . One of the country 's major insurers , which claimed it was losing a lot of money there , canceled thousands of policies because it could not raise its rates under state regulations . This was the first sign that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hardest-hit groups is the urban-area motorist . Many insurance companies find it undesirable to do business in the " core city " because of high losses there . It 's been charged that some companies black out whole areas and wo n't write any business for any residents within those boundaries . Particularly hard hit are Negroes and other disadvantaged groups . On a statewide basis , the tight markets exist in Maryland , Pennsylvania , New Jersey , Louisiana , and South Carolina . And easiest place in the country to buy auto insurance is the state of California , which has the most liberal regulations governing insurance companies . Most insurance executives would like to see all states adopt California-type regulations . They feel politicians have made a scapegoat out of the insurance industry " because they see the opportunity to make political gain when they lay a heavy hand on automobile-insurance rates . " Spokesmen for old-line agency companies say it is easier to get insurance through independent agents in this type of market because they can pick and choose from many insurers . Direct writers dispute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly retreating from the automobile-insurance market . " The independent agent has great trouble placing a risk and that ' - why he needs five or six companies . " says Thomas C. Morrill , a vice-president of State Farm Mutual . Auto-insurance sales figures indicate that the direct writers have grabbed the major share of the market from agency companies . A big reason for this is that @#  | leading direct writers like Allstate and State Farm Mutual have made agency merchandising techniques obsolescent . They have opened offices in the suburbs and in shopping centers where they can reach middle-class motorists ? a group that has a high number of preferred risks . But critics denounce insurance companies for that very reason . It 's alleged that the insurance industry 's practice of going after the more affluent suburban dwellers amounts to skimming the cream of applicants . Morrill retorts that State Farm 's method is not cream-skimming , but a " dreg-rejection " operation . " We keep people out who have an undue amount of motor-vehicle violations or accidents , " he says . " About @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had an accident in the past year . If you took the rank and file of America , you 'd find this is probably about what you have . " Allstate 's vice-president and general counsel George H. Kline says , " The superselective writers are the ones who do n't grow . You ca n't be superselective and grow about 15 percent a year , the way we 've been doing . " However , Senator Philip Hart ( D. , Mich. ) , a severe critic of the insurance industry , says the skimming process has " progressed to the point where occupations and home addresses are considered in judging a customer 's desirability . One company , for example , is reluctant to write policies for clergymen because they drive as if they believe the Lord will provide . ' Occupations commonly on the rejection list include doctors , house-maids , military personnel , farm workers , labor officials , editors , musicians , bartenders . " Senator Hart declares , " No one will quarrel with the concept that safe drivers deserve a break on policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's accident potential by his job rather than by his personal driving record ? " Is There Discrimination ? Insurance companies deny such discriminations . But Negroes and other residents of distressed areas have trouble buying insurance to a great extent because not many agents do business in those areas . An agent wants to sell insurance in a reasonably prosperous neigh- borhood to make a good living . Some applicants are looked down on because of the small possibility that they will someday have to testify in court . Continued  | Witnesses with bizarre occupations or unusual domestic arrangements might antagonize some jurors and cost the insurance company a verdict . Noncareer military personnel , because they are usually young men , find it difficult to secure coverage . Insurance actuaries say that men under 25 , in general , have a very bad accident record , and statistics amply bear them out . Whatever the reason is , an insurance company wo n't tell why it turns you down . They say that doing so would make them liable to defamation-of-character suits . But if you do get turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A recent survey by the member companies of the National Assn. of Independent Insurers revealed that " twothirds of those who apply to our companies after rejection or cancellation by another company are accepted . " If your driving record is such that no standard-rate company will accept you , there are still two types of auto insurance you can buy . Many of the top insurance companies have " running-mate " subsidiaries that specialize in the coverage of high-risk persons . The rates are about 60 percent higher on average than those charged standard companies . One advantage of having insurance with a running-mate company is that can work yourself back into the stand. : firm by piling up a clean driving record within a period of three to five years . There are also many other reliable firms that specialize in insuring high risk motorists . They usually charge abo the same rates as the running-mate companies . But a pernicious thing happened several years ago when many insurance companies started retrenching in certain areas . They left a vacuum that was filled by opportunistic firms that wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had inadequate reserve to meet damage claims made on them . Secretary of Transportation Allan Boyd told the House of Representative Subcommittee on Commerce and Finance last March that at least 80 insurance companies have failed since 1961 . H , said a survey of just 58 of the companies indicated that about 300,000 people had claims of over $600 million against the companies ? whose net assets totaled no more than $25 million . So do n't ever sign up with a marginal company . Before you do- that , you 'd he better off going into an assigned-risk plan . High-Risk Drivers The assigned-risk category is the last resort for some motorists , but it 's still better than having no insurance at all . Each state has an assigned-risk plan that requires every insurance company to accept a quota of " untouchables , " high-risk drivers who ca n't get insurance with standard or even substandard companies . From the loss figures these plans show , it 's apparent that most of the drivers are bad risks . Assigned-risk plans consistently pay out more in claims than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drivers wind up there for assorted reasons that range from clerical mixups to agents ' incompetence to perhaps a little thievery . Agents get a higher commission on assigned-risk premiums ; to some this may offer an inducement to put you there . State Farm 's Morrill says that his company gets about one out of every eight assigned risks nationally ? and that an examination of their records indicates that many people in the plan do n't deserve to be in it . Assigned-risk coverage basically offer , only minimum liability protection . Mangy companies , however , are now voluntarily offering comprehensive , medical pad - ments , uninsured-motorist insurance , collision , and even higher liability limits to their assigned risks . But State Farm says that only about four percent of the people in the plan have an interest in excess limits . Comments Morrill : " The people who are most risky to insure have the least interest in protecting themselves against the claims of others , or in being able to respond in damages to someone they may injure . " @# "  | The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Generally companies say that your driving determines your insurance costs . But many factors go into your individual rate , on top of the general principles the companies subscribe to . Some rates actually have no apparent actuarial basis , but are arrived at on a subjective basis . The two major organizations responsible for most insurance-company rates are the Insurance Rating Board ( IRB ) , which sets rates for companies owned by stockholders ; and the Mutual Insurance Rating Bureau , which is made up of companies that are owned by their policyholders . The direct writers set their own rates , which vary from the rating-bureau rates almost everywhere ; they are generally lower . In some rare instances , though , the direct writers have higher rates for certain territories . The rating bureaus have 260 basic classifications . The major ones are : ? Age . ? Sex . ? Use of car ( business or pleasure ) . ? Marital status . ? Territory . Then there are subclassifications which provide discount credit for driver education for young drivers , good-student discounts , and multicar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family policy ) . Another feature of the rating system is the safe-driver plan . This is designed to lower the cost of insurance for drivers who do n't have accidents or convictions for traffic violations in the three years preceding the effective date of their policies . The bureaus claim this makes their rates competitive with independent companies who " aim to insure only careful drivers . " But the safe-driver plan is tricky . Some critics even call it a gimmick . If you are lucky , your insurance costs under a safedriver plan can be reduced substantially . Run into some trouble and your cost can shoot up dramatically . The safe-driver plan works on a system of points . These are assigned for certain Continued  | types of accidents and convictions for moving-traffic violations by you or any driver in your household during the three years preceding the effective date of your policy . Here 's how points are determined : Any conviction for drunken driving ; failure to stop and report an accident , vehicle homicide , or assault ; or driving with a suspended or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that requires you to file evidence of financial responsibility with your state motor-vehicle bureau gives you two points against your name Any other moving violation that results in suspension or revocation of your license gives you one point . You would also pick up a point for any accident resulting in more than $50 damage . Q point is even assigned for two or more accidents that result in less than $50 damage . You are not penalized , thou if your car is in an accident while is lawfully parked , if your car is hit in t rear and you do not receive a traffic t - ; lation in connection with the accident . when you have an accident for which t other driver is responsible . Accides caused by hit-and-run drivers also do n't carry any point penalties for the victim . Cost and Safe-Driver Plans Here 's how your point standing affects your insurance-policy cost in a safedriver policy : Points Policy Cost 0 15% discount 1 5% surcharge 2 50% surcharge 3 100% surcharge 4 or more 150% surcharge The safe-driver-plan surcharges are on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher rate because you are under the age of 25 , any point-penalty surcharge you pick up would be added to your base rate , not to the entire premium . One big exception to the safe-driverpoint plan is Allstate , which does not take traffic-violation convictions into consideration in determining your rate . Allstate assigns points only for any accident in which it has to pay out in excess of $50 under your liability coverage . Allstate 's Kline explains that there is such an uneven level of law enforcement in America that there 's no common standard of judgment . " It becomes an absolute jungle of non-comparability , " he says . " We 're against speeding , going through stop signs ? all the things for which you can get a citation . But the payoff comes when you run into someone and you were at fault . We feel it fairly measures the risk . " Allstate 's safe-driver plan has eight categories . It has eight merit ( discount ) ratings and five surcharge ratings ? the highest runs to 250 percent above the base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fi year renewal guarantee . A motorist runs up a huge loss record against . state would keep his insurance , rega less of that , but his rates could reach assigned-risk level if he 's a bad enou driver . Allstate points out that all co panies have a merit plan , but no oth give their policyholders long-term surance security and a five-year renew guarantee . How does a bureau arrive at its ratings ! The IRB bases its rates on a survey 300,000 risks drawn from 17 company groups that write a high percentage of the bureau members ' business in 32 states . It is not based on the total experience of all the companies . But the bureau claims its sample reflects the true risks companies face in writing insurance . But critics charge that the insurance companies have insufficient actuarial data in many areas and use personal judgment in setting rates . Even within the industry there is a feeling that gimmicks not actuarially justified are used . One example is cited by George A. Peery. vice-president and actuary of GEICO . While Peery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses , he knows of nothing in his company 's experience , or in the experience of the industry , that justifies such a credit . There is no statistical evidence to support giving better rates to good students or graduates of driver courses .  | Special economy policies . The standd auto-insurance policy you buy is the Family Policy and this label will probly appear on the front page of your tract . But in many states , you can y a Special Policy , which can save you to 20 percent over a comparable FamiPolicy . The basic difference in a Special Poliis that it sets a single liability limit . stead of buying a 10/20/5 policy , you t a single liability limit of S25,000. is would cover all claims for both ily injuries and property damage used by one accident . You have to buy medical-payments verage if you decide to buy a Special Policy , but the rates are cheaper than those charged in a Family Policy . The reason : You can only collect hospital and medical expenses over the amount you receive from another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hospital or health insurance . Under a regular Family Policy , you can collect from duplicate sources and sometimes receive double the amount you actually spend . Multicar discount . You can probably save substantially on both your liability and collision insurance if you have more than one car and insure them with the same company . Compact cars . Many companies have abandoned discounts for compact cars , but others still offer reductions of about 10 percent on small cars . Farm-use discounts . If your car or truck ( up to 1,500-pound capacity ) is garaged on a farm or ranch and is n't used for going to any job other than farming , you can get a discount on both collision and liability premiums . Discounts for families with youngsters . Members of your household under 21 usually mean higher premiums in your policy . But you can reduce costs if all young drivers in the family pass a recognized driver-education course approved by the National Commission on Safety Education of the National Education Assn . Youngsters who are away at a college more than 100 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By notifying your insurance company of this , you can get a lower rate on your insurance cost in a number of states . Good students ( those in top 20 percent of their class ) who file a certificate signed by a school official get a 25-percent discount . Young men on active military duty are also considered nonresident members of the household , and notification of this status to your insurance company will reduce your premiums . Women 's discounts . Contrary to everything you may think , insurance companies regard women as safer drivers . Consequently females between 30 and 64 who are the only drivers of their car receive a 10-percent discount on their insurance . Out-of-service autos . When you 're going on a trip for more than 30 days without your car , you can arrange to suspend all but your comprehensive coverage during your absence . You can save a prorated amount if your policy and state permit this type of action .

When you buy auto insurance you want protection from financial ruin , and compensation for any personal injuries or damage to your car if you ever have an accident . How well does the U.S. insurance industry do the job of paying the victims of accidents , and how would you fare if your car crashed ? The truth is that our faultbased insurance system does n't seem to do as well as it should in compensating the victims of accidents . " Claims for compensation are processed slowly and inefficiently , often leaving accident victims without means to pay their medical expenses and to receive proper rehabilitative care , " Secretary of Transportation Boyd says . " The distribution of compensation is uneven and perhaps inequitable . It has been estimated that from 14 to 30 percent of those injured receive nothing .

This antagonistic legal situation creates a tremendous overhead ? adjusters ' costs , legal fees , and administrative expenses . So for every $2.20 in premiums the surance companies take in , only $1 to those injured in accidents . Blue C pays out $1 for every $1.07 it collects . Insurance executives defend the penses as being caused to a great ex by the contingent-fee system lawyers in getting paid for representing acci victims . Under this system , victims nothing if they lose the case . If they the lawyer gets one-third of the amo Insurance companies say they have build this contingent-fee cost into premiums . Settlements for injuries and dama are unduly delayed , even though 95 cent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I a good thing , too , because it can to anywhere from two to six years before a civil case can be tried in many cities . The long wait and lawyers ' self-interest frequently prevent seriously injured victims from getting full compensation for pain and suffering . When auto-accident cases go to trial , the insurance companies win about half the time . This makes many lawyers put pressure on their client to settle for a lesser amount , rather than risk losing the case ( with the attorney winding up with no fee ) . In New York State , in the year between July 1 , 1966 , and June 30 , 1967. there were 1,374 jury verdicts in autoaccident cases , and the average award was $13,842 . In 325 cases a settlement was made before the jury returned a verdict ; these averaged $13,354 , remarkably close to the amounts given by juries . But you can see from these figures that the huge settlement that makes headlines in rarity . Advanced-Payment Plan The industry meanwhile is making an attempt to speed up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is rapidly being adopted by many insurance companies to get aid to accident victims when they need it . Here 's how it works : When a policyhold112 POPULAR SCIENCE er has a serious accident in which he was clearly at fault in his company 's opinion , they will go to his victim and start paying all doctors ' and hospital bills . lost take-home ) earnings , car-repair bills , and any other immediate expenses relating to the accident . These payments r  | are made without the victim giving up his rights to eventually sue for additional c ) mpensation . Then , when the victim is on his feet again and ready to go back to work , or when he is home for a protracted convalescence , the company will attempt to make a final settlement with him . He can either agree to the amount they offer or take them to court to seek more , without forfeiting what he has already received . The Insurance Information Institute says that many companies that sell auto insurance are making use of the advancedpayment procedure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fights . Jack E. Koepke , a claims examiner for the Travelers Insurance Companies , says his company has handled 750 cases since early last year in which it has paid out some $750,000 in advanced payments for losses and pain and suffering . He says that 200 cases have been closed out with a final settlement . The company says its advanced-payment plan helps to hold down litigation costs and speeds rehabilitative care to the victims . Another sore point with some motorists is that insurance companies do n't pay enough to properly repair cars damaged in accidents . This charge is also made by the proprietors of body shops . A spokesman for the Auto Body Assn. of America told a Congressional hearing that 75 percent of the $2 billion gross volume done by auto-body shops is controlled by insurance companies . Robert Whittlesey , vice-president of the association , says , " Our members are deeply concerned about some of the inequities that have grown up in this industry , due to certain monopolistic and coercive practices which encourage the operation of unsafe vehicles and at times result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insurance companies through their appraisal practices , to repair vehicles at the cheapest possible price , will often prevent expenditures vitally necessary for the proper operation and safety of the repaired vehicle . " N. Morgan Woods , manager of the claims bureau of the American Insurance Assn. , disputes this . Woods says , " Insurance companies do not attempt to dictate to the car owner where he should have his car repaired or how it should be repaired . " He explains that usually the owner of a car reports an accident to his company and submits estimates of damage from local repair shops . " If the adjuster estimates the repair costs are reasonable , the company will pay the car owner , who is then free to have his car repaired at any repair shop he selects . " Are Changes Needed ? Insurance executives recognize that the public is showing increased resistance to the rising cost of auto insurance . " The system costs more than the public is willing to pay , " says Robert Gilmore , associate counsel of the American Insurance Assn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be to go to a " first-party " system . That 's the same principle that your fire insurance , health insurance , and most other types of insurance operate on . You collect from your own company for any losses you sustain . In auto insurance , you usually have to collect from another company , which you do n't patronize ? one that does n't have any particular reason to curry your favor . While nearly everyone agrees that changes are needed , there is great disagreement as to the form of the changes . Some experts suggest that taking the regulation of the insurance industry out of the hands of the states and substituting federal control would help . One plan which has most stirred up the insurance industry is the basic-protection plan authored by Professors Robert E. Keeton of Harvard and Jeffrey O'Connell of the University of Illinois . This plan was recently up for enactment before the Massachusetts legislature and was defeated . But it has many supporters and is pending before the legislatures of about seven other states . The Keeton-O'Connell plan would compensate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for medical expenses and up to $750 per month for  | lost wages . This would be paid by the injured person 's own insurance company . Some features of the plan have been attacked by the insurance industry . but there is a surprising degree of acceptance of the proposal by many top insurance executives . One group that is steadfastly opposed to the basic-protection plan is the Trial lawyers lobbied successfully to feat the bill in Massachusetts because they feel it would put many of them of business . Professors Keeton and O'Connell that their plan , if it were enacted in N York State , would pay 25 percent m people than the present system d while dropping auto-insurance costs fr 15 to 25 percent . Most of the savin would result from reduced legal fees . The issues are confusing to the av age motorist . Even though a new day may be dawning , it has n't quite arrived . But you do n't have to be at the mercy of the system if you plan carefully . Know what your needs are . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel that you have been incorrectly rated by your company , do n't hesitate to take the matter up with a higher authority . Insurance companies admit that slip-ups do sometimes occur and try to set them right . If you do n't get any satisfaction from your company , take the matter up with your state insurance commission . Even in the tight insurance market that exists today , you can save up to S50 on your coverage costs by wise shopping and packaging . You should not attempt to do this , though , if you are n't a preferred risk . If you have trouble getting insurance , try another agent or company before you take an assigned-risk policy . If you 're a city dweller who has difficulty in securing auto coverage , talk to a suburban agent who probably can get you a policy if he has a good loss record . Use your deductible options wisely to save money on collision coverage , but do n't try to save on liability . Weigh the desirability of switching to a Special Policy that can save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Accidents can cost you a lot more than higher insurance premiums . @#
