RUSSIA AT WAR : 1941-1945 by Alexander Werth. 1,100 pages . Dutton. $10 . <P> Though it ended months before the Atomic Age began , the Russo-German portion of World War II was in almost every way a conflict on a thermonuclear scale . Upwards of 20 million Russian civilians and soldiers lost their lives . Over 3,000,000 German soldiers were killed , wounded , or missing . The U.S.S.R. lost over 60% of its coal production ; total industrial output declined by one-half . Whole cities were heroes : the Battle of Stalingrad lasted seven months with as many as 40,000 people killed in one day , while the siege of Leningrad went on for 21 years and killed nearly 1,000,000 . <P> In the two decades since the war ended , there has not been in English a complete history , in both military and human terms , of Russia 's remarkable role . Author Alexander Werth is uniquely qualified to make the attempt . He is an English journalist who was born and raised in St. Petersburg and is perfectly bilingual . He spent all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a sympathetic left-wing nonCommunist , he was given unusual freedom of travel . He was one of the only two Western journalists allowed into Leningrad during the siege . He kept a day-by-day diary , filed innumerable dispatches to British and U.S. papers , and turned his Russian war experiences into several personal-history books in the ' 40s . Now he has put it all into one book , drawing also on the voluminous official histories and the published memoirs of commanding officers and common soldiers on both sides of the Eastern Front . <P> Stuffed with Shredded Paper . Many of the details are unfamiliar and fascinating . Strategically , for example , Werth rates the Battle of Kursk ( north of Kharkov ) , in July 1943 , as " Hitler 's last chance to turn the tide , " and thus as important as Stalingrad the previous year . Werth is at his best in eyewitness accounts of Leningrad or of his tour ( in - 40 C. weather ) through the Stalingrad area just after the mop-up there . The item about Russian children using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes a one-sentence summary of the horror of war . <P> Yet , for all its excellences , Werth 's book is as irritating as the kind of Christmas present that has dozens of valuable tiny pieces to be groped for in a large box stuffed with shredded paper and excelsior . The style swings from a somewhat wide-eyed journalese to a plodding heroic prose . The best parts , it turns out , are lifted in great chunks from his earlier books of war reporting . He quotes endlessly from Pravda and Red Star editorials ; he pads out his pages with Supreme Soviet speeches complete with the ritual enthusiasm of " ( prolonged , stormy applause ) " ; he is mercilessly repetitious . <P> Questions &; Exonerations . Worse are the omissions and persistent seeming biases . In his account of Russian unpreparedness for war , Werth does not mention that the Soviets received a clear and correct warning of Hitler 's timetable from their trusted agent in Japan , the German journalist Richard Sorge . He gives no more than a sentence to the three-to-four-week delay of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek resistance in the spring of 1941 , although that delay may well have been the most important single factor in the German failure ( by 15 miles and some bad weather ) to capture Moscow before winter .
