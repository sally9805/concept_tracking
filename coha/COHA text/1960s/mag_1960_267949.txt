For the President-elect 's press entourage , the baby 's birth was the first crisis since the election . Newsmen had been filled in minute by minute as they flew back to Washington , but one inevitably sought detail was missing from the intimate picture . What did the baby look like ? Pierre Emil Salinger . Kennedy 's press secretary , seemed slightly flustered , could only stammer : " Aw , it looks like a baby ... It has some hair . . . The hair is dark . . . I 'm very poor at descriptions of children . " <P> Such an answer would have astonished and perhaps irritated the assembled newsmen had it come from Eisenhower 's Press Secretary Jim Hagerty . But it caused no fuss coming from Pierre Salinger , a pudgy , 35-year-old father of three who looks naked without a cigar clamped between his teeth . Reporters admired Hagerty 's , efficiency ; they personally are fond of Salinger , consider him their friend and ally in the incessant scramble for news . <P> After next January , Pierre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the U.S. public-though perhaps less so than Hagerty , their bosses being so different . Salinger is the first to say : " Hagerty is just about the greatest technician that ever came down the pike . " <P> Boy Skipper . Born in San Francisco , Pierre Salinger* was a child prodigy at the piano , at the age of six impressed an audience at Toronto 's International Exposition by rippling off a Haydn sonata . <P> After two years at San Francisco State College he joined the Navy and , just before his 18th birthday , became one of the youngest men ever to skipper a U.S. Navy ship , taking over a submarine chaser . Returning to San Francisco in 1946 , Salinger became within five years , at 26 , night city editor of the Chronicle . By the time he quit to go to Collier 's in 1955 , he had made a name for himself by stories exposing prison conditions and breaking up a municipal bond racket , and by helping to solve a murder . On the side , he worked for California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Adlai Stevenson 's California press-relations chief during the 1952 campaign . <P> Innovation Through Jack . Salinger 's career at Collier 's was short and bitter sweet : he was preparing an expose of West Coast Teamsters . Union operations when the magazine folded in 1956 . Bobby Kennedy , counsel to the U.S. Senate 's special subcommittee investigating labor rackets , heard of Salinger 's work , and he was hired by the committee as a special investigator . There he met Jack Kennedy . <P> In his new job , Salinger will have some advantages over Jim Hagerty-as well as some disadvantages . Dwight Eisenhower , perhaps out of old Army habit , generally held himself coolly aloof from the White House press ; Jack Kennedy , whose first job was as a reporter for the old International News Service , is far more accessible to the press , numbers several reporters among his closest personal friends . But White House reporters operate on a communal code , are likely to raise Cain with Salinger when favoritism is shown .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
