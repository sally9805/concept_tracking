Probably the best-known Wagnerian tenor of the century , Danish-born Lauritz Melchior , retired from the opera stage 19 years ago . Since then , he observes accurately enough , " there has been no one to replace me . " One reason is that his major roles require a Heldentenor ( heroic tenor ) , that rare breed of singer with the stature of a Valhalla deity , the projection of a diesel horn and the stamina of a Channel swimmer . <P> Heldentenors are made , not born . <P> They are usually high baritones who take time off in their late 20s or 30s to ac quire a tenor 's range and build up their voice . But careers move so fast now adays that few singers can afford to interrupt them . The result , says Melchior , is that " the breed has practically vanished . " Most of the tenors who attempt these heroic roles are a bit jugendlich ( youthful-sounding ) . Meantime , great dramatic sopranos like Birgit Nilsson are Isoldes in search of Tristans , and some of Wagner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Melchior , now 78 , has been doing his part by scouring the ranks of young singers for potential Heldentenor ma terial . He formed his own Heldentenor Foundation five years ago , and by this year had raised enough money to offer some deserving prospect a year of sub sidized study and practice . Last week , at Manhattan 's Juilliard School , he auditioned nine candidates from among 50 applicants around the country . The judges included Singers Nilsson and Alexander Kipnis and Juilliard President Peter Mennin . They picked not one but two winners , each of whom proved in extreme ways Melchior 's dictum that no two Heldentenors are alike . <P> John Russell , 36 , has never sung a role with a professional opera company , and only learned about the audition four days ahead of time . As a Negro , he is an unlikely looking Wagnerian hero . The father of six children ( soon there will be seven ) , Russell makes his living as a research chemist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Philadelphia . Until he started lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26 , he had done most of his singing in church choirs and shower - stalls . Instead of a Wagnerian selection , he sang an aria from Verdi 's Otello , impressing the judges with his brooding intensity and naturally rich , dark-timbred voice . A good thing , too , because Otello " is the only role I really know . " <P> Helden Chest . The other winner , William Cochran , 25 , was almost barred from the audition as too young . A huge , 250-lb. former weight lifter and lineman on the Wesleyan University football team , Cochran once wanted to become a minister . But singing in the Wesleyan Glee Club eventually diverted him to Philadelphia 's Curtis Institute . Already a veteran of concert engagements and small roles at the Metropolitan Opera , his selections from Lohengrin and Walkure displayed massive power and a brilliantly glossy upper register . Every day , Cochran runs a mile and works out to preserve such Heldentenor traits as his 52-in. chest . " My ambition , " he says , " is to be able to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
