txt Following Richard M. Nixon 's impressive victory in Oregon , top Republican leaders in 36 states now see the former Vice-President as the likely presidential nominee . Furthermore , in , a survey by this newspaper , GOP leaders in 33 states said the bulk ? of their own state delegation was either going to Mr. Nixon or leaning in his direction . In two other states it was said that half of the delegation would go for Mr. Nixon . In all except a handful of instances , the state leader providing this information to Monitor writers in the 50 states was the Republican state chairman . In a few states where the chairman was not available to be interviewed , a GOP na* // // tional committeeman or another key member of the state committee gave the assessment . There were these further significant find-ings : ? The real dip in the Reagan and Rockefeller prospects lies in the fact that only one state leader ( in Alabama ) said he saw California Gov . Ronald Reagan as the possible winner . This was state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Mr. Nixon would win the nomination . Nomination ' locked in ' ? Mr. Goldthwaite also said that the bulk of his state 's delegation would go to Governor Reagan . But no leader said he saw New York Gov . Nelson A. Rockefeller as the eventual win ? ner in Miami . And only in New York , Rhode Island , and ? Massachusetts did leaders say that the bulk of the delegation from his state would wind up in the Rockefeller column . ? Seventeen state leaders said they ' thought that Mr. Nixon 's nomination was now " locked in . " Twenty-six said that Mr. Nixon 's position had not yet reached that point , although many in this group thought the nomination was moving now in that direction . Several state chairmen ? particularly those from states with favorite-son candidates  --  underscored their neutrality and remained noncommittal when interviewed or refused to comment in any specific terms to the questions about the nomination . Some answered some questions but declined to answer others . In this group was California where there is a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Governor Regan . Chairmen in New York and Pennsylvania were quiet , too . Those are states where Governor Rockefeller has considerable support , but where there obviously is a grow : : : ing feeling in GOP ranks that Mr. Nixon can not be beaten . Also , there was nothing specific from the Ohio chairman  --  where Gov . James A. Rhodes has been leaning toward Mr. Rockefeller . Stop-Nixon ' views To the question : " Do you see a possibility of a " stop-Nixon " movement being effec tive , " only eight GOP state leaders said " yes . " Another 18 said " no . " The remainder were noncommittal on this question . GOP leaders in the following states now see Mr. Nixon as the " likely winner " : New Hampshire , Rhode Island , Vermont , Florida , Georgia , Louisiana , Mississippi , North Carolina , South Carolina , Alaska , Hawaii , Idaho , Montana , Arkansas , Illinois , Indiana , Iowa ; Kentucky , Minnesota , Missouri , Nebraska , North Dakota , Oklahoma , Texas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wyoming , Delaware , Virginia , West Virginia , New Jersey , South Dakota , and Tennessee . States where GOP chairmen say the bulk of their delegation will go to , or is cleaning toward , " Mr. Nixon : New Hampshire , Vermont , Florida , Georgia , Louisiana , Mississippi , North Carolina , South Carolina , Alaska , Arizona , Idaho , Montana , Illinois , Indiana , Iowa , Kentucky , Minnesota , Missouri , Nebraska , North Dakota , Oklahoma , South Dakota , Texas , Wisconsin , Oregon , Utah , Washington , Wyoming , Delaware , Virginia , and West Virginia , Tennessee , and New Mexico . Half of the delegations in Maine and New Jersey now seem headed in Mr. Nixon 's direction , the interviews indicated . It seems important to note that the state leaders said , by a margin of 27 to 17 , that they did not think the Nixon nomination was " locked in " yet . Reflective of this view is the comment by Clark Reed , GOP state chairman from Mississippi : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be nominated . But so much has happened in the last two months that I will not say the nomination is locked up . If half as much happened in the next two months it could be that someone else would be the nominee . It looks now as if it will be Nixon vs . Humphrey . " In South Carolina the state chairman , Harry S. Dent , said Mr. Nixon will get the nomination and adds that the only person who could stop Mr. Nixon would be Nixon himself . The state chairmen as a whole seemed to think that Mr. Nixon had largely erased his loser image . Said Victor L. Smith , Illinois state chairman : " Nixon looks more and more like a winner . He 's gaining strength daily ; he 's overcome the loser image ? and he seems to be doing everything just exactly right . " Even the rapport with the press looks good . It 's interesting to note that hatchet editorials from many big-city newspapers have n't materialized , like they have in past years . " Delegation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " I believe Nixon really has it sewed up . " He said eight or nine of Delaware 's dozen delegates are for Mr. Nixon , the other three or four for Governor Rockefeller . Minnesota state chairman George Thiss said : " It Wogs like Nixon . I have the feeling that the Minnesota delegation will be split down the middle . But I think there will be more than 50 percent for Nixon eventually . " Mr. Thiss said he did n't think Mr. Nixon " has it locked in . " " This is a year , " he said , " when events can change things . It is possible that somebody other than Nixon can get it . " Kansas chairman , George Nettels Jr . said he considers the race still wide open , although " Nixon is obviously in the lead . " Thomas L. Secrest , North Dakota chairman : " At this point it looks like Nixon . But with this reservation  --  Nixon must hold up in the polls between now and the convention . That 's the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chairman William Murfin of Florida said the nomination will " go to Nixon , obviously . " He added : " It 's difficult to know where all the favorite sons are going , but it 's my guess he 's Nixon got enough votes to get the nomination now . " Iowa GOP chairman Jack Warren sees the situation leaning more and more in Mr. Nixon 's favor but he hesitates to conclude that Mr. Nixon has the nomination locked up . His chief reason for hesitation is the evidence he sees of the lack of enthusiasm of independents and " weak Democrats " for Nixon . Mr. Warren estimates the bulk of the Iowa delegation will go to Mr. Nixon . . Mrs. Elly Peterson , Michigan state chairman , insisted the race for the nomination is still wide open " despite Oregon results . " I ca n't see that they affect Nixon one way or the other , " she said . " If there was any surprise it would be Reagan 's percentage . That may give him some impetus . " The bulk of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romney leads them . and that is expected to be toward Governor Rockefeller if he has any real chance by convention time . Mrs. Peterson estimated that 35 to 40 of the state 's 48 delegates would follow Governor Romney to either Governor Rockefeller or Mr. Nixon . Connecticut state chairman Howard E. Hausman had an " I do n't know " on the likely winner question . " Nixon does not have the nomination locked up , " he said . " Bue we 're not part of any stop-Nixon movement . " Texas GOP chairman Peter O'Donnell Jr . declined to state that Mr. Nixon has the nomination locked in : " If Reagan forces teamed with Rockefeller forces , this could provide the base of a stop-Nixon effort  --  but I doubt that this will come about . " He said that Mr. Nixon would attract the bulk of the Texas delegation .
