Just after Christmas , Stefan Cardinal Wyszynski , Poland 's Roman Catholic primate , preached a sermon in Warsaw that could be read last week as defiance in advance . The cardinal spoke of " maternity wards which have become mortuaries , " and said that " the doctor should continue to be a doctor , a defender of life , not a gravedigger and murderer . " But as far as Poland 's government was concerned , the nation 's 1,000 abortion clinics ( or clinics for " interrupted pregnancy " ) were not doing enough of a job . The government is alarmed about Poland 's birth rate , the highest of any large nation in Europe . In 1959 " private " abortions in Poland rose to an estimated 800,000 . Last week , denouncing the public clinics for excessive bureaucracy , the government announced new streamlined procedures to put public abortion within the reach of all . From now on , a Polish woman who wants the operation needs only declare verbally to a doctor that she can not afford the child . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in cases of extreme stubbornness , have him prosecuted .
