The Most Rev. James P. Shannon , 48 , has a reputation for being a thinking man 's bishop . A former president of the College of St. Thomas in St. Paul , with a doctorate in history from Yale , Shannon marched at Selma and has been an outspoken critic of the Viet Nam war . Auxiliary Bishop of St. Paul and Minneapolis since his consecration in 1965 , he has served as deputy head of communications for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops ; he was the conference 's press spokesman last fall when the U.S. bishops defended Pope Paul VI 's encyclical on birth control . <P> Last week , though , it became clear that Shannon is on the other side of the argument . A confidential letter he had written to the Pope dissenting from the encyclical became public , and he was reported to have submitted his resignation . The reason for his resignation , according to Religion Editor Willmar Thorkelson of the Minneapolis Star , who broke the story , was Shannon 's inability to accept the prohibition of contraception as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shannon wrote the Pope last September : " In my pastoral experience I have found that this teaching is simply impossible of observance by many faithful and generous spouses , and I can not believe that God binds men to impossible standards . In seeking to counsel such persons , I have found myself resorting to all sorts of casuistry and rationalization in the hope that I might keep faith both with Your Holiness and with the people of God who seek my help . I must now reluctantly admit that I am ashamed of the kind of advice I have given some of these people , ashamed because it has been bad theology , bad psychology and because it has not been an honest reflection of my own inner convictions . " <P> Shannon has been the favorite prelate of many U.S. Catholic progressives . Thoughtful and articulate , he has thought of himself as a bridge between radicals and conservatives in the church ; yet his own liberal views may well have prevented him from getting his own diocese . After Shannon appeared in an NBC documentary discussing tensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cardinal McIntyre complained to the U.S. hierarchy , reportedly calling Shannon 's , tolerance for change an " incipient schism . " <P> In Santa Fe last week , where he is teaching literature at St. John 's College on leave from his archdiocese , Shannon refused to confirm or deny the reports of his resignation but did explain his letter to the Pope . " A bishop is not just resolving these questions for himself , " he said . " He is asked to give counsel to others . His burden of responsibility is greater than that of the individual Catholic . " Shannon himself hopes to continue to teach at St. John 's College through the summer . If and when the Pope accepts Shannon 's resignation as Auxiliary Bishop of St. Paul and as pastor of St. Helena 's Church in Minneapolis , he will remain a bishop-but without portfolio . As for the birth control controversy , his challenge to the encyclical makes it clear that the issue is not dead . Indeed , one Vatican rumor has it that Pope Paul is preparing yet another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
