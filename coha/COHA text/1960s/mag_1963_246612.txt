David and Lisa , shot for less than $200,000 by a man and his wife ( Director Frank and Scenarist Eleanor Perry ) who had never made a movie before , tells the anguishing and tender story of two psychotic adolescents ( Keir Dullea and Janet Margolin ) who meet in the pit of madness and help each other to climb out . <P> Lawrence of Arabia . A handsome new comer named Peter O'Toole is the star of this great big beautiful $10,000,000 spectacle-produced by Sam Spiegel and directed by David Lean-that describes the amazing adventures of a peculiar young Englishman who became the guerrilla genius of World War 1 , but the customers will find themselves more fascinated by the landscape in which the story was filmed , by the infinite billowing sea of golden sand that covers Arabia Deserta . <P> Freud . Director John Huston has turned out an intense , intelligent cinemonograph on the early struggles of the Viennese papa of psychiatry . Montgomery Clift does fairly well as Freud , but sometimes looks more like a patient than a psychiatrist .

Broadway 's elephantasy of 1935 , pumped full of Metrocolor , comes to the screen as a " pulchatoobinous pachadoim " of a picture-anyway , that 's the way Jimmy Durante says it , and in this picture Jimmy himself is 100% right .

A man who does not know who he is and a woman who thinks he is her husband suffer their strange dilemma in a strange but affecting French film , thoughtfully directed by Henri Colpi . <P> Mutiny on the Bounty . Trevor Howard , as Captain Bligh , is all man and a yardarm wide in MGM 's $18.5 million reconstruction of The Bounty , but Marlon Brando has chosen to play Fletcher Christian as a sort of hard-alee Hamlet . <P> Long Day 's Journey into Night . Eugene O'Neill 's play , one of the greatest of the century , is brought to the screen without significant changes and with a better than competent cast : Katharine Hepburn , Ralph Richardson , Jason Robards Jr . and Dean Stockwell . <P> <P> TELEVISION <P> Fri. , Jan. 11 <P> Eyewitness ( CBS , 10:30-11 p.m. ) . * The week 's top news events . <P> <P> Sat. , Jan. 12 <P> Challenge Golf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 13-match series for $156,000 , involving Jack Nicklaus , Gary Player , Arnold Palmer and Phil Rodgers at Los Angeles Country Club .
