 | Let 's Clean Up This Highway Mess THIS IS the story of a national disgrace : the collusion , chiseling and bureaucratic incompetence in our **25;400;TOOLONG highway-building program . Over the past six years , disclosures of shoddy work and shameful squandering have shaken the program. * In the last two years misconduct has reached the point where even the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads ( BPR ) ? which has consistently minimized the corruption , carelessness and criminality ? has admitted to Congress that " irregularities are occurring " and that there 's " urgent need for investigation . " Roughly one out of every three dollars that American drivers pay for gasoline is sopped up by road taxes . Most of it funnels into state and federal tills to help finance construction of the 41,000-mile net of interstate superhighways , plus provement of the nation 's pri and secondary roads . Over 35 lion dollars has already been comitted to these highway projects . the program 's hoped-for comple date in 1972 , the total cost will teed 70 billion dollars . The cost is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the p been receiving its money 's worth Skulduggery in Arizona . Step a field laboratory in Arizona w state highway inspectors are run stone chips through screens , sor them into pans on the floor . The job : to check the work and quaff of materials on various sections a 31-mile stretch of former U.S. ( now Interstate 8 ) , which cost 293,694 . What is actually takj place in the lab ? The inspectors carefully sorting the chips in on to create fake samples that will p 86  | muter . Then the totally fabricated sample is sent of to a laboratory in Pheonix ! This brazen fakery was spotlighted by the Special House Subcommittee on the Federal-Aid Highway Program , whose chairman is Rep. John A. Blatnik of Minnesota . The extent of skulduggery in Arizona was astounding . James Shipp , 18 years old , was hired as an inspector less than two months after u left high school . He was soon shelving tests that failed , or substituting figures from older test reports , r just dreaming up reports and adjusting the phony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sled Shipp as having made 302 out f ; 90 tests on two road jobs costing 2,444,423 . His acknowledged faking ; of reports ran from 30 to 50 percent ! Shipp was just one of ten young employes who testified before Congress . Another , Junius C. Layton , explained how some days he would eve to take three or four samples of mixed road material before he could find one that would pass inspection . more than one good sample turned , it was put aside for days when no adequate ones could be located . Were you aware of the fact that to falsify the records is a crime ? " Layton was asked . " I kind of had an idea it was n't exactly right , " he said . Last June the Blatnik subcommittee published a sterner verdict : " The record spells out an incredible potpourri of waste , mismanagement , frustration , inexplicable confusion , callous chicanery , and indiscriminate indulgence of forbidden practices . " Gallery of Horrors . This was the subcommittee 's eighth report . And more hearings are due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " It could n't happen , " or , " It wo n't happen again . " Yet it keeps happening ? in one place or another . During 196o and ' 61 , in Oklahoma and New Mexico , shocking disclosures were made of fraud , grave deficiencies in testing , inadequate controls over construction , intolerably slack federal inspection . Now the Blatnik subcommittee report reveals in Arizona " an almost point for point commission of the same offenses that were uncovered in Oklahoma and New Mexico , " which " would never have been permitted to exist " if Washington 's " command level " had " pursued a course of affirmative and aggressive action . " Reading the 12,000 pages of testimony given before the Blatnik subcommittee is an eye-opening experience . With for witnesses admitting irregularities or improper practices , they expose a picture of widespread highway outrages . Congress ' Watchdog Barks . The Blatnik disclosures are matched by mounting reports from Congress ' investigative arm , the General Accounting Office . The fact-filled  | pages of 25 GAO documents , plus its testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of findings covering 37 states . Two items : A BPR official in one state spent only 2% hours reviewing a six-million-dollar project . Another federal auditor okayed large figures if the penny columns added up correctly ! Ridiculous disregard for economic values was uncovered . A fancy overpass was built in Idaho for a road expected to carry 15 vehicles a day ? by 1975 . In Virginia an elaborate interchange was justified by a " probability " that two interstate routes would converge ? but one of them never showed up at that juncture . One three-million-dollar , 5.7-mile stretch of four-lane divided highway near Lincoln , Neb. , started breaking up before it was opened to traffic . Another 6.3-mile section costing $2 , - 100,000 revealed " uncontrolled longitudinal cracking and deterioration . " Yet even the GAO 's extensive examinations can not possibly reveal the full extent of the highway mess . As one highway investigator told me : " It 's like standing beside the Mississippi River and throwing out a bucket every once in a while to check the quality of the water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much money and has so many people in its hire that it is virtually a power unto itself . As the roadbuilding industry reminded Congress this year at appropriation time , road construction provides jobs for 870,000 workers , with another 500 , - 000 employed by federal , state , county and municipal highway agencies . Total payrolls : an estimated 5.9 b lion dollars a year . Moreover , fro city hall up to Congress , every off ' holder is acutely aware that the le erally aided highway network hand out more cash hourly than any other public-works program in our 1U tory . The result is a brawny alliance of vested interests that reacts violet ly to comment on the porgram 's overriding abuses and ingrain faults . Loot in Land Deals . The acquisition of rights-of-way for highway reeks with ineptitude and scan Involved are about 730,000 parcels real estate . It was originally e mated that the total price tag would be five billion dollars ; now it is expected to go far above seven billion dollars . Three years after the in state program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid for land without pro evidence of value , and there was policy for holding up payments questionable claims . Yet in course of eight more reports GAO has discovered 14 kinds right-of-way deficiencies , with pr lems in this category existing in states ? from Maryland to Michigan to Montana . Look at just one deal on Inters 95 in Miami , as revealed by the Blatnik subcommittee . Florida tur over $82,000 ? for removal of some 36o buildings and residences ? A. F. Foster Inc. , which made quick $37,000 profit by hiring a sub- contractor to do the job for $45,000 . That 's just the beginning . The subontractor next sold 130 of the buildings for $111,373 , and spent $35,900 to demolish the rest , thus netting a cool $75,473 ? which , added to the S45,00o he 'd been paid , rings up a take of $120,473 . The Price-Jackers . Lax enforcement of clear-cut federal regulations has been mainly to blame . Declares the subcommittee report : " As the testimony in the Florida case so vividly discloses , policy and procedure memorandums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington levels to enforce strict adherence to the rules . " Look at the dismal account of property deals in West Virginia , as reported by the subcommittee . After a check of irregularities there in 1955 ( which the BPR brushed off as " not Considered of serious consequence " ) , the GAO returned to the state in 1958 and found no improvement . A year later Washington finally dispatched a Project Examination Division team , which , not surprisingly , discovered grave deficiencies still existing . These remained uncorrected still into the spring of 1961 . By this time , nearly 32 million dollars had been spent on right-of-way in West Virginia . Finally a BPR appraiser with experience in 16 states journeyed to West Virginia . His conclusion : " This is without a doubt the least efficient right-of-way operation I have encountered . " Properties were king appraised and reappraised in a greedy search for any excuse to kite the settlements . In one four-block , 1500-foot stretch in Beckley , W. Va. , the state shoveled out nearly $514,000 for 27 properties that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Price-jacking on 20 of them ran above 200 percent , with one 2588-percent overpayment ! A Long-Distance Job . For sheer brazenness , it 's hard to surpass the high jinks of the father-son team of J. Walter and W. David Stalnaker , brought to light in Congressional hearings . The elder was a West Virginia right-of-way agent whose salary checks over a 43-month period aggregated $22,875 . But he more than doubled this by giving out landappraisal assignments to 3o-year-old David , who in less than a year made $23,225 . Of the 6o checks he received , 57 went into his father 's bank account . David visited California and from there performed 21 back-home reappraisals with the help of some phone and mail information . One invoice showed claims for 14 hours of labor at $10 an hour . His total fees for the long-distance labor : $1545 . " Hearings have disclosed cases of dishonesty and fraud in several states , " the Blatnik subcommittee declared last March . " A number of persons have shown an inclination to minimize the importance of such disclosures on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the handling of right-of-way matters in West Virginia should provoke much thought  | on the part of persons holding these views . " Holes in the Road . By far the biggest money-eater is construction . A case in New Mexico provides a striking study of how not to construct a highway . Probes by Congress show that a contractor named jack Adams built a four-mile stretch of road in the southwest corner of the state for which construction costs totaled $1,146,113 . On the day it was found acceptable by New Mexico officials , R. B. Collins , maintenance-crew foreman , counted 16 holes being patched by the contractor 's employes . Soon , he testified , an extra crew had to come in to try to keep the road together because " the holes kept coming faster than we could repair them . " So-called repairs amounted to ripping out and virtually rebuilding strips up to 400 yards long . Sagging was so bad that Soo-foot puddles appeared after rainstorms . State-furnished information shows a $55,071 maintenance bill for 16 months . At first , unbelievably , a BPR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " satisfactory . " Two months later , when everyone could see the highway was falling to pieces , another official concluded that " complete rehabilitation of the entire project is going to be necessary . " Yet , according to Blatnik subcommittee findings , Adams was given five more federal-aid highway contracts totaling $2,723,000 ? all of them months after the deficient job had been exposed . Summing up the New Mexico mess , Chairman Blatnik said , " The record reflects unparalleled arrogance , ruthless disregard for constituted authority and contempt for the rights of tax ? payers . " While Washington Fiddle Swarms of construction ills are being opened to public view in New Yorke Last March the GAO issued a scath ing 6i-page report . Item : In th Albany area on Interstate 87 , a chec of one section showed " most of the gravel stone " was below standar Nevertheless , a BPR official said appeared that the material met sta specifications , offering " no pertinent evidence " for this " opinion . " At project on the Harlem River Driv inspections were so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of of 28 days , " and , at another project over 10,000 barrels of cement were poured without any checks . For months the staff of Ne York 's assistant attorney general , A lan N. Smiley , has been halting cod struction trucks , checking materials against invoices , and finding shoe weights and cheating . One federal aided road involved in the prof is the seven-mile , 4o-million-doll Staten Island Expressway . Evident of alleged fraud has been present to a grand jury , and more than 5t persons are expected to testify . And what is Washington doing meanwhile ? " We 're watching ti situation closely , " an official assure me . Only a Thin Layer . Just months ago , Assistant Attorney Genet- Herbert J. Miller , Jr. , head of the Justice Department 's Criminal Division , told Congress : " A review of t he program 's operation throughout he country has disclosed incidents of maladministration and malfeasance ? fraud , bribery and conflict of interest . Because of its tremendous I i nancial stake , the federal government must exert every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 1956 federal.aid highway program through last June , federal indictments have been lodged against 39 persons or corpora1 ions . So far , 25 convictions have esulted . Charges have included " perjury , " " falsification of records " nd " conspiracy to defraud . " Yet t these are but the thin layer visible on top . Because existing federal laws in this area are inadequate , countless rases never reach the courts . Here are samples of current wrongdoing that could be more effectively prosecuted with stronger statutes : ? An appraiser simply copied the work of another appraiser , then swore he had made an " indepen ( lent " appraisal . ? A state representative in charge of property management filched fixtures from buildings on land bought li ) r right of way ? and covered up by claiming the property had been vandalized . ? A state highway commissioner applied influence and pressure to more than double the valuation of his own land taken for highways . An original low appraisal was mysteriously removed from the high- way-department files . " These are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misconduct , " says Under Secretary of Commerce for Transportation Clarence D. Martin , Jr . Moral Corrosion . In Florida , state employes accepted tens of thousands of dollars in money and gifts from contractors doing more than 6o million dollars ' worth of projects in which federal aid participated . The favors extended to at least 30 state road-department engineers and inspectors . The total " take " of one engineer has been above $10,000 . The purpose of this largess , according to Congressional probers : a " calculated campaign " to " minimize , neutralize and negate any disposition toward firmness on the part of state engineers who discovered performance of sloppy or substandard work . " One eye-opener came with testimony of the subcommittee 's chief investigator , which revealed that Cone Bros . Contracting Co. handed out money or valuables to 26 state road engineers , 16 of whom collected regular weekly payments totaling $23,325 . Julian Lee Cone , Jr. , president of the company , was asked why . " To help expedite the work , " he said under oath . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The same " moral fungus " has infected other states . Delaware 's Attorney General Januar D. Bove , Jr. ,  | investigated several years ago and found an atmosphere where " petty graft appears to flourish luxuriantly . " The State Highway Department 's chief engineer , Richard A. Haber , with responsibility for recommending contract awards involving millions in state and federal funds , admitted that 125 contractors and operators involved in state highway building showered him with gifts ranging from cases of whiskey to cash items of $2o to $100 . Asked by Bove , " How widespread is this practice ? " Haber replied , " I would say that of our ' too-odd employes , at least 1050 will have received a gift of some sort every year . " The practice of political giving has also got out of hand . Engineers and contractors are expected , for example , to pony up money for fundraising dinners or fatten party war chests by such devices as buying ads in " official " dinner and convention programs . These , plus outright donations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " money . Challenge to Citizens . If ever a vast government program was in need of urgent reform , it is the federal-aid highway program . Florida Rep. William C. Cramer , a ranking member of the Blatnik subcommittee , warns : " We have just scratched the surface . We have a long way to go before the stealing of the taxpayer 's dollar is fully exposed . " These steps are therefore urgently required : ? First , there must be full and frank acknowledgment by key highway officials that a critical problem indeed exists . ? Probes by federal and state authorities must be increased . After years of persistent GAO recommendations and Blatnik subcommittee findings , a new investigative uni was finally set up at the BPR . It ha plenty of work to do . Already over 400 allegations of irregularities i more than 40 states have been entered . ? Falsification of appraisals , bribery , conflict of interest and other of defenses should be made specificalyl punishable under U.S. criminal laws . Such proposals now before Congress must be acted on without delay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributions from those negotiating for , or holding , a contra involving federal-aid highway money . Toleration of waste and wrong doing in public programs opens the door to corruption and moral deca This is a matter of concern to ever driver , taxpayer and citizen . @#
