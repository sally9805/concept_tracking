 | The Biggest Daddy of them All To some harness horsemen , Adios is merely the greatest of standard bred sires . To his extreme admirers , however , this 22-year-old patriarch is the mightiest father of all the mammals , past or present . Really far-out Adios buffs such as James C. Harrison of Pennsylvania 's giant standardbred nursery , The Hanover Shoe Farms , throw in the fish and the birds . " I know of no male of any species , " says Harrison , " who has dominated his field the way Adios has harness racing . He gets champions out of any mares , by any stallions , out of any bloodlines . " Since Hanover Shoe happens to own a one-third share of Adios , Harrison is perhaps a touch biased . But he , and anyone else who goes to the record , can justify all extravagant superlatives . Take Adios ' achievements in the Messenger Stake , the richest harness race of all . His offspring have won four of the six Messengers so far , twice finishing one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roosevelt Raceway will make special news for horsemen only if the sons of Adios get whipped . There are three Adios 3-year-olds in the race , including the redoubtable Lehigh Hanover . " When you get the Adioses to the head of the stretch , " says Stanley Dancer , the New Jersey reinsman who drives Lehigh , " they dig in and go . " Because they do so in large numbers and with fantastic consistency , new glory accrues to Adios every year . As things stand now , this bold-eyed , smallish , symmetrically formed stallion has : ? Led the sire list in earnings by his sons and daughters for seven consecutive years , topping the No. 1 Thoroughbred sire the last four years as well ( although flat-racing purses add up to three times the amount raced for by standardbreds ) . ? Accumulated 10-year earnings of $10 , - 099,726 by his get ? a figure more than twice that of his leading contenders , Rodney and Hoot Mon . ? Sired the absolute speed record holder for harness racing 's standard one-mile distance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who has just entered the stud at a fancy $3,000 service fee . ? Sired the world record holder at ages 2 and 3 , Bullet Hanover , whose clockings are 1:57 and 1:55 3/5 , respectively . ? Sired 52 performers who have been timed in two minutes or less . ( Timed speed is far more important in harness racing than in flat racing , and two minutes for the mile is par ; two-minute horses automatically join the sport 's elite . Nearest to Adios in two-minute @# A  | production is the late , much esteemed Volomite , with 33 performers ) . ? Sired the highest-priced standardbred yearling , Dancer Hanover ( $105,000 in 1958 ) . Only two racehorses , both Thoroughbreds , have brought more as yearlings . They are a Swaps-Obedient colt ( $130,000 in 1961 ) and England 's Sayajirao , for whom the Maharaja of Baroda paid $117,600 in 1945 . ? Earned a million dollars , before taxes , for Driver-Trainer Delvin Glenn Miller , the incomparable horseman who picked up Adios for $21,000 in 1948 . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1955 to Hanover . After the capital gains tax , the sale left Miller with a juicy lump sum of $375,000 . Shortly after selling Adios , who had never left his farm , Miller repurchased a one-third interest for $166,666 . The Pennsylvania road contractor and horseman , Max Hempt , also bought in for a third . Hanover already has collected $1,307,500 in Adios yearling sales for its one-third share . Even if Adios dies after the current breeding season ( he is in excellent health ) , Hanover stands to earn nearly $1 million more from the three Adios crops on their way to the sales and then the races . Hempt also has made a massive profit , as has Miller . All this is remarkable enough , but perhaps the most arresting aspect of the Adios story is that horses of his gait were the humble proletariat of harness racing not so very long ago . Adios is a pacer , as are most of his offspring . They move by lifting both legs on one side simultaneously , then those on the other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and until recently the proud and dominant one , is the trotting gait . Trotters lift the left front and right rear legs at the same time , then the right front and left rear legs . ) Two hundred years ago George Washington lent his aristocratic presence to a pacing race at Accotink , near Mount Vernon . He entered a horse and paid a jockey 12 shillings to ride ? not drive -- him ( these were saddle horses ) . When in the 19th century the pacer was hitched to cart and sulky , " his loss of vogue was immense and immediate , " according to the late John Hervey , the foremost historian of trotting . " No gentleman drives a pacer , " sneered the bloods who flashed over the continued @#  | roads of the Atlantic seaboard behind the smart , jaunty trotters who were the forerunners of today 's standardbred racers . This dictum , though watered down as years passed , forced second-class status upon the pacer until after World War II , but now the tables are turned . The new , postwar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hang a pair of hobbles on them and get them racing without all the fine , expensive tuning trotters require . Moreover , the pacing strain seems to be a dominant one in breeding . A trotter-bred sire often produces pacers ; pacers rarely father trotters . Today the pacer is king ? outnumbering the trotter two to one on the racecourses ? and nothing better epitomizes his climb than the career of Adios . Bred in Indiana by the late Leo C. McNamara , Adios was sold for $2,000 as a yearling to one Thomas Thomas , a Cleveland meat dealer . If the colt 's pedigree was not quite classic it was a good , solid one , stemming in male line from Leland Stanford 's trotter , Electioneer , a son of the fabled Hambletonian . Adios ' sire was Hal Dale , whose name reflects a splash of the blood of the Tennessee pacing Hals , and his darn was Adioo Volo , a daughter of the immense trotting-bred pacer Adioo Guy ( 2:003/4 ) . As a racehorse , Adios was one of the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Counsel . It was wartime , and they paced for everything but money . In four years and a fraction Adios started 88 races , won 44 and earned precisely $33,329 , although he set six world records . His finest performance was in Lexington , Ky. in 1944 . There , at 4 , he outpaced King 's Counsel in two straight heats , each in 1:581% . The cumulative time lowered a two-heat world record of 30 years ' standing . Adios was driven at 2 and 3 by the late Rupert Parker . Falling ill in the spring when Adios was 4 , Parker handed the horse over to Frank Ervin , who found the pickings paltry . " When the horse was 5 I could only get two races for him , " recalls Ervin , who has since become famous as a colt trainer . " We went for $1,200 at Goshen and $1,000 at Lexington , and we could n't get another blessed race . There just was n't any money for fast-class pacers in those days . Oh , yes , we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Illinois from two minutes to 1:571/2 , against time . " It was a shame , because Adios was grand-looking and great-gaited , with a very high flight of speed . His only fault was that he raced better on the front end than behind . Coming from behind he 'd sometimes get lapped on the leader and just hang there and sulk . But when he was cuttin ' out all the pace he was awful hard to catch . " Ervin tried to peddle Adios for Thomas at Lexington , in 1945 , asking $7,500 but finding no takers . During the winter , though , he sweet-talked the late Harry Warner , eldest of Hollywood 's Warner Brothers , and a West Coast textile man named L. K. Shapiro into buying the horse for $16,500 . Ervin raced Adios three times as a 6-year-old at Santa Anita , where Warner and Shapiro were among the organizers @# of a harness race meeting . The second time out , Adios set a world record of 1:44 for the seldom-raced distance of seven furlongs . The next week he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was critical . Ervin quit him , and Driver Neal Boardman guided Adios in his next and last race , which he narrowly won in cheap company after starting with a 130-foot handicap . Adios was trained at 7 and 8 and booked to a few nondescript mares in those years , but he raced no more . During 1948 Warner and Shapiro decided to disband their standardbred stable , and Adios went into the auction ring in Lexington in the fall of the year . Here entered Del Miller . There probably never has been a man to equal Miller as an all-round harness horseman . He is affable , he is shrewd and it detracts nothing from his fame to say that he also  | is very lucky . Adioses do not fall to unlucky men . In 1948 Miller was private trainer for W. N. Reynolds of the Carolina tobacco people ( Camel cigarettes ) . Miller had bought a 360-acre dairy farm in Meadow Lands , a drab little town in the hilly bituminous coal country of southwestern Pennsylvania . He wanted to start breeding harness horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior stallion. s all horsemen know , picking stalA lions is like drilling for oil . You ca n't tell in advance whether you will bring in a gusher or hit a duster . Miller sought expert advice from the man whose counsel he most respected ? the late H. M. ( Doc ) Parshall , a first-rate drivertrainer who was also a veterinarian . " Buy Adios , " advised Doc Parshall . " Look back at his darns . This horse is going to sire great fillies , and that will make his chances all the better . " Miller , who had seen and admired Adios as a racehorse , became obsessed with the idea of buying him . But he had just $6,000 in the bank ; the horse might sell for anything from $10,000 to $50,000 . One angel who had promised to back Miller deserted him on the very morning of the sale . A second angel materialized , however , in Duke Kelly , a used-car dealer pal of Miller 's who had flown to Lexington with him from Winston-Salem . At ringside that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the master of Hanover Shoe Farms , who then had no designs on Adios ( " The horse had been buried out in California " ) ; Frank Ervin , who did ; and a mysterious character in levis and cowboy boots . " There was a lot of bidding on Adios up to $10,000 , " Miller recalls , " and then it seemed to hang there . I said , $10,100 . ' All of a sudden it pops up to $11,000 . I look around to see who 's bidding against me , and there 's this guy who looks like a cowboy . We go along like that , with me raising the price a hundred every time he jumps to the next thousand . When he gets to 20 thousand I hold up one finger , meaning $20,100 . " George Swinebroad , the auctioneer , says , I have $21,000 , ' and now the cowboy quits and I own Adios . But 1 was pretty mad about getting soaked for the extra $900 and I raised a fuss . The auction people offered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , thanks , I guess I 'll keep the horse . ' " The cowboy , it developed , had been sent to the sale by Harry Warner to protect Adios to $20,000 . It is Frank L-rvin 's recollection that he was in the bidding to $14,000 . He had n't wanted to go above continued @#  | $10,000 but " got fiddling around " because he and another horseman wanted to stand Adios in Kentucky . Adios was a hit from the start . From his very first crop of California-bred foals came the two-minute pacer Prince Adios . Miller scuffled mightily to find decent mares for Adios at the then somewhat steep service fee of $300 , but he often had to settle for mediocre ones . Thus it was with the produce of ordinary matrons that Adios began to make his reputation . Breeders speak of " nicks , " or the affinity of one bloodline for another . " Adios did n't nick with those mares , " says one horseman , " he overwhelmed them . " In dazzling and unparalleled succession came the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adios Betty , Adios Harry ( 1:55 ! ) and Dottie 's Pick ; the Butler , the Bullet and the marvelous freelegged mare Countess Adios ? boys and girls together , overrunning the classic colt races and the now-rich free-for-alls in a stupefying display of speed and stamina . Adios leads a comfortable life at Miller 's Meadow Lands Farm , but one devoid of showplace plush . His large and airy stall is at one corner of a plain wooden barn . He spends a great deal of time listening to the light classical FM music piped into the barn , standing quietly , with his glistening , finely crested neck held low toward the horizontal and his magnificent head still . Sloping away below the barn is his private paddock , where he sports when the weather is fine . It contains an apple tree , and Adios sometimes nibbles the windfalls . Although still remarkably handsome at 22 ( he 'll be living on borrowed time after 25 ) , Adios is beginning to show his age in white hairs among the bay on his forehead and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many as 70 mares in a season . This year it is 45 , next year it will be fewer . For the outside mare owners who can get to him , his service fee is $12,500 ? the highest ever , except for a few private deals , for any sire . Adios has everyone 's awe , but there has been no greater tribute to his eminence than this , from E. Roland Harriman , probably the sport 's most respected senior citizen and a trotting-oriented man who despises hobbles and will not own a hobbled pacer : " Adios is out of this world . I am glad that I have lived long enough to see him produce . "
