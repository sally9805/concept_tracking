txt Danielsville , Ga. , Sept. 4 IUD ? An all-white jury took little more than three hours tonight to find two Ku Klux Klansmen innocent of the killing of Lemuel Penn , 48 , a prominent Negro educator from Washington , D. C. There was scattered applause in the crowded courtroom and the klansmen 's wives sobbed for joy as their friends crowded around them . Congratulates the Pair Despite their acquittal , Joseph Howard Sims , 41 , and Cecil William Myers , 25 , are still not free of charges connected with Penn 's July 11 slaying . Federal charges still are pending , accusing them of violating Penn 's civil rights by killing him with two shotgun blasts on a lonely highway . Prosecutor Clete Johnson , who passionately had demanded the death sentence for Sims and Myers , shook hands with the klansmen and congratulated them . " I 'll sleep a good sleep , tonight , " said . Sims , " but not as good as if I were home with my family . " Sims Got Warried He and Myers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady stream of friends . Then they were taken to jail . Sims said he got worried when the jury continued to deliberate for more than an hour after eating . But he said the decision was the only verdict " they could bring and be fair . " " When God is on your side , man ca n't harm you , " said Sims ' sister . Asked if he would continue to be active in the klan , Sims said , " I could n't tell you that even if I knew . " Myers Is Silent Myers , pale and shaken , had no comment . The prosecution 's main case was a batch of confessions signed by James Lackey , also implicated in Penn 's murder with Sims and Myers . Lackey had repudiated at least one of the confessions , and the defense claimed that he had made them either under duress or for a Federal Bureau of Investigation reward . Lackey was to be tried separately . The defense 's case hinged on the testimony of two witnesses who claimed they saw Myers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a passing car on a fog-shrouded road . Cheering Breaks Out When the verdict was announced , cheering broke out but Judge Carey Skelton quickly silenced it . The crowd waited impatiently until Skelton adjourned the court , and then ran to the gleeful defendants . The defense attorneys , who had urged the " Anglo-Saxon Madison county jury " not to " send these here boys into those cold ' gray ' stone walls " to be electrocuted , smiled broadly and congratulated their clients . Then , with several police officers and well-wishers , the attorneys escorted the klansmen across the street to a law office to celebrate . Expecting A Fourth Sims is the father of eight children . Myers has three . Mrs. Myers was expecting a fourth child at any moment , and said , " This the verdict will probably do it . " None of their children was present . Mrs. Sims said : " I 'm overjoyed . I 've prayed for this . " For the first time during the trial , which began Monday , she broke down and wept . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed relatively carefree . " No Hard Feelings " Prosecutor Johnson , who had told the jury that the " honor of the state of Georgia is on trial , " shook hands with Sims and Myers . " No hard feelings , " Sims said . " There 's nothing personal in this , " replied Johnson , gripping the klansman 's hand . " I know it , or I would n't be doing this , " said Sims with a smile . " After the pictures and interviews in the lawyers ' office , Sims and Myers were returned to Madison county jail . Their attorneys said they would seek to have their $25,000 bond on the civil rights violation charge lowered . At any rate , it was expected that the men would make bond and go free until the federal grand jury meets early next year . The charge of violating the dead educator 's civil rights carries a maximum penalty , upon conviction , of a $10,000 fine and five years in prison .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
