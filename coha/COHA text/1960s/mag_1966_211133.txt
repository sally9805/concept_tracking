Even in such undistinguished company as George Chuvalo , Brian London and Henry Cooper , Karl Mildenberger hardly seemed a name to be reckoned with . Cassius Clay , for instance , could n't even remember it . " Who is your next challenger ? " somebody asked the heavyweight champion , and Clay replied : " I do n't know , but he 's the champion of Germany . " <P> Actually , Mildenberger , 28 , was the champion of all Europe . He had lost only two out of his 54 professional fights , and he was something of an oddity besides : a lefthander . Experts still sneered at Karl 's credentials . For one thing , he had rarely chosen to fight away from Germany and the tender solicitude of German referees-like the one who forgot how to count when Mildenberger was flattened in the first round by unknown Dave Bailey last September . ( Mildenberger eventually won the fight on points . ) <P> When Clay agreed to fight Mildenberger last week in Frankfurt , the first thing he insisted on was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight figured to be a cinch . Bookies made Cassius a l-to-10 favorite , and even the promoters-with a fat TV contract in the bag-made little effort to build up the German as a challenger . " Do you think our Karl has a chance ? " a Frankfurt cab driver asked one of the promoters . Sighed his passenger : " To live . " <P> Clay took Mildenberger lightly too . He had , Cassius admitted , made a few adjustments in his boxing style to counteract Mildenberger 's lefthanded attack ( he had twice lost to lefthanders as an amateur ) . " The way I figure it , " said Clay , " it will take me about three rounds to figure out Mildenberger 's southpaw style , and two or three more to finish him . " As it turned out , it took Clay twelve rounds to finish the stubborn German . <P> Three times , Clay knocked Mildenberger down . Three times , Mildenberger got up . Clay opened cuts under both of Karl 's eyes ; with the blood dripping down his chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lefts to the head . Try as he might , the champion could not put Mildenberger away ; the referee stopped the fight in the twelfth and declared Cassius the winner by a technical knockout . Heaving a big sigh of relief , richer by $200,000 , Champion Clay began preparing for yet another title defense , this time against Houston 's Cleveland Williams-whom Sonny Liston once described as " the toughest man I ever fought .
