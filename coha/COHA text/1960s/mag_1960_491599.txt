Lonely Tony Perkins Although he has found success as an actor in Hollywood and on Broadway , young Anthony Perkins has some perplexing ; personal problems he still ca n't solve . Wth the release of his new motion picture , On the Beach , Anthony Perkins faces what may well prove to be the most crucial test of his career . In recent years he has frequently been called the most talented actor of his age  --  either in pictures or on Broadway , where he is best remembered for his starring role two years ago in Look Homeward , Angel . But in On the Beach he plays a part completely new to him  --  that of a perfectly ordinary , uncompli  --  cated young man with a wife and baby . As Stanley Kramer , the film 's producer-director , says , " It 's the most normal thing Tony has ever done . " And whether Perkins can score an equal success in such a role remains to be seen . From the time he first won wide public ac  --  claim  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cooper 's son in Friendly Persuasion three years ago , Perkins has been known for his sensitive performances as a series of brooding , introspective youths teeter  --  ing indecisively on the brink of manhood and tortured by deep inner conflicts . It is a role which fits him as if he invented it . Standing a skinny six feet two and a half inches , he has the awkward . unco-ordinated look and the round-shouldered stance of arecently sprouted adolesceni His head , top-heavy with its thick tangle of dark-brown hair , seems to have been intended for the next  --  smallcr-si/e body , and his face tapers from a broad forehead above nearsighted brown eyes down to a narrow and defenseless chin be  --  neath what is probably the most engagingly bashful grin in America . Indeed everything about him somehow radiates the poignancy of youth . But he is nearly twenty-eight years old now ; and in the words of Robert Mulligan , a direc  --  tor who has worked with Perkins twice , " Tony obviously ca n't go Continued on Page .51 ) January 9 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shy boy forever . " Perkins himself feels this very keenly , and he hopes that On the Beach will show him instead as a mature young man . " I think I 'm a little sterner , stronger than I was , " he says , " a little bit more level  --  headed , more gathered . Sometimes in a person 's development as a public person  --  ality strange mutations take place , and a person becomes really different . He can change in appearance , gain or lose weight or marry or be in a television series . But I think I 'm still more or less the same per  --  son as ever , grown up a little  --  like the boy in Friendly Persuasion or Look Home  --  ward , Angel , only he 's been to college now and he 's a little bit more of a person than he was . " Yet some people who have worked with Tony Perkins feel that he needs to grow up stilt more before he can do justice to a mature part . Tony himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's pouring boiling water on the instant coffee of what you 've already experienced . " The question is whether he has yet experienced enough of life to store up the necessary instant coffee . Perkins has always lived more intensely in a world of his imagination  --  of books , movies , the theater and games of make  --  believe  --  than in the real flesh-and-blood world , chiefly because he has never felt at as in the intimate give-and-take of close human relationships . " My great problem , " he says , " is that I 've always felt  --  and especially since I 've become a so-called personality and a celebrity and so forth  --  that it was all a very exposable myth that 1 was somebody . I 've felt that this was an absurd dishonesty and that if I were close to people , it would be in  --  stantly evident and that they would say , ' Well , gee , he 's nothing at all . What do we want to see him for ? ' If I can talk to someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel I can carry on the myth of being a full person ; but any longer and I would be shown up as an empty , worthless nothing . " Tony 's feelings of inadequacy became more than he could bear about eighteen months ago during the shooting of Green Mansions , in which he starred with Audrey Hepburn . " I 'd had a bad day with the picture , " he says . " Everything I did was wrong . 1 could n't expect them to listen to my suggestions when I was all colorless and shrinking , invisible . I just reached the point where I felt 1 needed some sort of support on my side of life . " In desperation he turned for help to Henry Silva , the picture 's villain , and Silva suggested a doctor he knew , an analyst . " I called from the set , " Tony recalls , " and I put all my hopes on the telephone call . I said , ' This is Anthony Perkins ; you may have heard of me . ' He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought , Well , he 'll never see me . I 'm sunk . But he said he would see me the following day . " Tony went to the analyst begging , in effect , " Give me a personality . " Instead  --  and much more to the point  --  the doctor has helped him begin to understand the personality he has . And perhaps the most important thing Tony has come to understand is the part played in his life by his father , Osgood Perkins , one of the fine actors of the ' 20 's and ' 30 's . " My father died when I was five , " Tony Says . " We were just in the first stages of our relationship  --  when you 're live , you 're just beginning to know people anyway  --  and when he died it was such a blow to me , such a shock to me , that I talked my- .. self inu people up to a certain point is going to be good . After a certain point I feel , Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father to die again , . do n't want to he kit kid axon , . So I can only let a relationship with somebody ex  --  ist up to X barrier . And then I will not go any further . " Short of that barrier , however , Tony can show great warmth and kindness . " He 's the kind of a guy who 'll always know your birthday , " Henry Silva says , ' even though you never told him . " And Fred Astaire , with whom Tony worked in On the Beach , says , " He was terribly , terribly nice to me . He knew that I was concerned about playing my first serious part , and I used to talk to him ahout that . I had several scenes to play with him , and he 'd give me sort of signs of encourage  --  ment when he was off screen . I really ap  --  preciated it . " Most actors also find Tony an extremely entertaining companion around the set . When he was working on The Match  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and Shirley Machine took to each other immediately . As Tony says , " In this business , when you like people , you must like them intensely , you must like them right away and you must like them all out , because you 're only going to be together for maybe six weeks . You ca n't wait a week . " " I think Tony 's very much fun . " says Shirley ? " way out of the confines of the kind of fun that everybody is used to . He 's got a very vivid imagination : and if some  --  thing that happens springboards some  --  thing in his mind , he will go elaborate 5 ' 2 H AT u R D AN ' KvEN IN r. ; P 0 9 ' I ' on it  --  like , from it gust of wind at the door he could imagine he 's on the Sahara during a sandstorm . And he brings you along in the gag . But , " she adds , " his feel  --  ings get hurt if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Tony had a couple of large fan-magarine pictures of himself tacked up in his dressing room ; and she took one and pasted it on the camera , where no one could miss it . " And I drew a mustache on it and eyebrows and earrings in his cars or something , " she says , " and he got very upset . I think it 's immaturish of him to be mad be  --  cause I put a picture up . " Probably what upset Tony most about this particular gag was that it dumped him off the make-belies e plane by involv  --  ing something as inherently real and in  --  timate as his own face . He much prefers to leave his real self out of the game , hid  --  ing it behind an imaginary personality . And undoubtedly this self-protective in  --  stinct goes far toward explaining his reputation  --  often exaggerated  --  for ec  --  centricity . As Robert Mulligan says , " I think he gets a small belt , a kick , out of shocking people . It 's part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't get to know Tony . You 're too busy notic  --  ing his bare feet , the rebel hat he 's wear  --  ing or the stick he 's juggling on his chin . " The result of these tactics is that there are probably not more than half a dozen people in the world who feel they really know Tony  --  and half of them are wrong . Shirley MacLaine realizes she doesn't. " l 've never been allowed that precious moment of seeing what Tony Perkins really is , " she says . " I do n't know what 's an act and what is n't an act . " At that , Tony 's relationship with Shir  --  ley was a good deal more spontaneous than he usually allows himself with girls  --  because Shirley is married . He is apt to be rather guarded with unmarried girls . He has the idea that his acting would suffer if he were contentedly mar  --  ried or even engaged . " It 's a question of a serene mind 's making my performance less fertile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't permit him to cul  --  tivate a friendship which could end in matrimony . Since he is frequently at  --  tracted to marriageable girls , however , he sometimes " leases it to fate " to de  --  cide what course the relationship will take . And he 's not above giving fate a small nudge . A year or so ago , for instance , he had gone to a premi  --  re with Joan Collins , who is both unmarried and , says Tony , " the most gorgeous brunette I have ever seen in my life . " When he brought her back to her apartment , she went out to the kitchen to make sandwiches  --  Tony does n't drink . " And I thought to myself , " he says , " I would really like to call this girl sometime . But then I thought , No , I ca n't call her . How could I get her to call me ? So I took a pencil and I started writ  --  ing my phone number on pieces of paper in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wrote it on her memo pad , I wrote it inside the script she was reading . And I put ' TP ' after each one . Then when I left . I dashed home and f sat there by the telephone and I thought , Well , this will decide it  --  if she 'll only call me . And I ca n't blame myself : I 'm not pushing anything here . " But he need n't have worried about be  --  traying his art . Joan never did call , and perhaps it is just as well . Tony has always been able to ease his way out of romantic involvements  --  as he did the three times he became engaged while in college . In the last analysis he simply can not let any  --  one get that close to his real self . As if to compensate for his essentially shallow approach to life , however , Tony gives himself completely and passion  --  ately to his craft . Acting is , in a way , his outlet for all the emotionalism he other  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the most important thing in his life . " The greatest reason why he 'll go on to even greater success , " says Stanley Kramer , after working with Tony in On the Beach , " is that he cares : about the per  --  formance he turns in  --  and it 's evident every single second . Nothing is too much . We could rehearse a scene , then shoot it ten times , and Tony would still say , ' Can we do it once more ? Do you think it 's there ? Do you think we got it ? ' " Nor is his own performance . all Tony cares about , as Joshua Logan discovered when he directed the actor in the still-unreleased comedy Tall Story last sum  --  mer . " Tony was intensely interested in everything about the picture , " Logan says , " from the way we were planning to present the titles and the music that would be under the scenes , to all of the actors who played the bit parts . " Tony 's interest in acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother says , " I think from the time he was very young he took it for granted he would be an actor like his father . " And Tony adds , " I thought when I was a kid that the reason my parents named me Anthony Perkins was that it has seven letters in each word  --  it makes a good marquee . " An only child , Tony was born in New York City on April 4 , 1932 , and had what his fellow actor and childhood friend John Kerr describes as " a very average upbringing for an upper-middle-class city boy . " Shortly after his father 's death , Tony suffered an attack of tuberculosis which has left him with a permanent low threshold of exhaustion and which has disqualified him for military service . But except for a convalescent visit to his maternal grandmother in Florida at that time , he spent the first ten years of his life in New York , and he still considers it his home town . Early in World War II he and his mother moved to Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had never been a professional actress her  --  self . Recalling those days , Mrs. Perkins remembers her son as " far from a model child . " She says , " My friends with chil  --  dren the same age thought 1 was lax about discipline , but I felt that Tony had a unique and creative mind and I wanted to give him every chance to develop it . " When he was thirteen , however , she sent him away to Brooks School , in North Andover , Massachusetts . " He was doing poor work in day school , " she explains , " and I felt he needed the challenge of being more with men and boys . " Tony was miserable at boarding school , mostly because he preferred reading quietly in his room to joining in the bois  --  terous activities of his contemporaries . But the summer after his fifteenth birth  --  day his mother finally allowed him to try his impatient wings at acting . Through friends she arranged for him to join a summer-stock company in Brattleboro , Vermont . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says , " collected props , rang the telephone bells , played the off-stage rec  --  ords . Then I 'd run down and sell orange drink during intermissions . " Better still , he made his debut as a professional actor , playing a supporting part in Junior Miss . One performance in particular haunts him to this day . " I used to love to sec how plays looked that I was part of , " he says . " And when it was n't my scene . I used to dash out and stand at the back of the house and watch . I was watching Junior Miss one night . I heard the doorbell ring , and the people on the stage said , ' I wonder who that could be , ' and I thought , Oh , I wonder who that can be . And then I real  --  ized that it was I who was supposed to be there on the stage . It was the eeriest feeling  --  hearing the bell and watching the door and thinking , Who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Despite this monumental blunder , Per  --  kins worked with stock companies during every summer vacation from then on , and he feels that this experience  --  aug  --  mented by later work on the Broadway stage  --  taught him all he knows about acting . " You do not learn about acting from being in the movies , " he says . " Movies are made so mechanically . You do the best you can as fast as you can . It 's the rehearsal that you 're shooting . It 's as if the day we first got together for rehearsal , six weeks before Look lions , ward ? , ingel opened , we had all intro  --  duced ourselves and then the director had said , ' Listen , you know your parts ; we 're going to open tonight ! ' And yet that happens in movies every day . In all eight major studios , people get together and open that day . " Tony 's first experience in making mov  --  ies came in 1952 , when he was a student at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sophomore year he heard that M-G-M was casting a picture called The Actress , based on a play in which he had recently appeared in stock , and was testing young men for the very part he had taken . Accordingly , he hitchhiked his way to California and , through the intercession of a friend of his father who worked for Metro , was given a screen test . No glad little cries of discovery were raised at the studio as a result of this , however , and by the time Tony returned to Rollins the next fall , he had given up all hope of getting the part . Then late in the autumn he received a telegram saying , as he remembers it , " How 's S350 a week ? Arrive December nineteenth . " Tony hastened to Hollywood and com  --  pleted the picture during his Christmas vacation , It was not a wholly euphoric experience ? " I did n't learn anything ex  --  cept to shut up and be there , " he says  --  but he expected great things from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York for his senior year to be closer to the theatrical and television casting offices when The Actress brought him to their attention . The picture opened in October , 1953 ? " with a conspicuous lack of success , " Tony remarks . And despite the tireless efforts of a talent agency , no one seemed eager to hire the fledgling actor who had appeared in it . Finally the next spring , just as Tony 's discouragement was turn  --  ing from dark blue to black , he landed a minor part in one show of a television series . Small crumb that it was to nourish a boy 's hopes , it marked a change in Tony 's fortunes . Other television jobs fol  --  lowed  --  he recalls his roles as being " a furious lot of long-haired , desperate , searching , wide-eyed beatniks " ? and then that summer he got his first really golden opportunity . Tony 's friend John Kerr was due to leave the cast of Tea and Sympathy , in which he and Deborah Kerr  --  no rela  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John 's suggestion , Elia Kazan , the director , invited Tony to read for the part . " That part , " says Tony , " is the best part written for a young man , ever . It runs the traditional gamut from the height of exhilaration to fathomless de  --  spair . It 's a beautiful , great part . " But Tony almost muffed his chance . " I remember the afternoon they read him , " says John Kerr . " He read with Deborah down in the lounge at the Barrymore Theater , and I sat on the steps and lis  --  tened . And I was afraid he would n't get it because he read kind of slowly and , you know , as if he were afraid to really read it . " " It was like a fraternity initiation , only worse , " Tony says . " The lounge was pitch-black , and there were just two lamps , one for me and one for Deborah , and a big couch to sit on . It was so eerie and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did get the part . and he left Columbia a month short of graduation to begin rehearsals . " I could n't do both , " he says . " And rather than go to the registrar 's office and get in a big deal , I just picked up my books , took my name off my locker and went to as many classrooms as possible and erased my name off the seating plan . I thought I 'd get kind of a kick out of seeing how completely I could vanish without leaving a trace . " Disappearing thus magically from one world , he made an equally effective en  --  trance into another . Both audiences and critics applauded his moving portrayal of the gentle , almost effeminate schoolboy in Tea and Sympathy , and by the time the play closed thirteen months later , Tony had established himself as a new actor of great promise . From Broadway Tony went straight to Hollywood for Friendly Persuasion . Wil  --  liam Wyler , the film 's producer and di  --  rector . had come East earlier to test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the New York actors who read for him . The reading took place in Wyler 's hotel room while the director had breakfast , " He sat there eating ham and eggs , " Tony recalls . " He said , ' Read a couple of scenes . ' So I thought , Jeepers creepers , and just did my best . I read one of the scenes , and lie kept eating . Then he said , ' Have a cup of coffee , ' and I figured 1 had at least a good line on the part . Funny how little things like that mean so much . " Looking back , Wyler remembers , " He was sort of lanky , like Cooper ; you would believe hint as Cooper 's son . And I did n't want a fellow who was too physical . I wanted someone who looked strong in spirit . " After making Friendly Persuasion  --  but a year before it was released  --  Tony signed a seven-year nonexclusive con  --  tract with Paramount , and the studio lost no time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made six pictures , receiving star billing in the last five . Only one of these does he remember with any pleasure . This was Fear Strikes OM , based on the true story of baseball player Jimmy Piersall . Tony still considers his performance as Piersall the best of his career . The role posed a double-barreled chal  --  lenge . Never having played baseball , he had to learn the game from scratch  --  and as a right-hander , which he is not . Even more arduously , he had to portray a man building up to , and finally suffering , a severe nervous breakdown . Since Tony had , of course , never actually experienced the pressures of big-league baseball , Rob  --  ert Mulligan , who directed the picture , pointed out to him that Piersall 's anxieties ere not really very different from Tony 's n . " It was Tony 's first starring pie ? ? ure , " Mulligan says . " He was being given his first break , first big chance to go somewhere  --  as Piersall was when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tony had to make good ; yet he knew  --  and Mulligan reminded him  --  that any one of a number of things could go wrong and send him back to the minor leagues of show business . Thus , while Tony played his scenes of gathering torment , Mulligan would be saying to him , " What about this Perkins ? Is he really a star ? Has he got what it takes ? Or is he just a fraud , a flash in the pan ? " And Tony , always highly sug  --  gestible , would act out his own personal fears , smashing his fist through a closed door , swinging wildly at his " teammates " or clawing his way up the backstop , and the sound track was dubbed in later . " Tony is deeply sensitive to language , " Mulligan says . " He can be emotionally keyed up  --  as he had to be in that  --  and it 's something very difficult for an actor to do alone . He needs that outside goad . But his response is immediate  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and real , very real . " Tony , in fact , finished the picture so exhausted emotionally that he had to spend two weeks in the hos  --  pital . Aside from Fear Strikes Ow , however , Tony 's career in Hollywood proceeded somewhat haltingly after Friendly Per  --  suasion . " They put him in some awful junk , " says William Wyler . " Instead of carefully and jealously guarding him as a valuable property  --  as you would a new car even  --  they said , ' Quickly ! Make a few pictures quick ! ' They 've been intent on making money instead of developing Tony 's talent . " Even films from which much was ex  --  pected  --  like Desire Under the Elms and The Matchmaker  --  proved disappointing both at the box office and to Tony . " Very dry , very lifeless , " he calls them both . Before either of these was released , how  --  ever , his personal reputation had been shored k'e " 4 " " " " ' ' ' ' to Broadway in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time his movie commitments would allow  --  Tony played Eugene Gant to capacity audiences . " It 's a highly emotional role , requiring a great deal of imagination , " says Kermit Bloom-garden , the show 's producer . " I think Tony 's performance was brilliant . " When he left , the cast presented him with a cigarette box inscribed with the play 's cast of characters . Since Tony does not smoke , however , the box remains empty  --  except for a note reading , " We love you and hate to see you go , " and signed by all his fellow actors In the summer of 1958 , following Look Homeward , Angel , Tony returned to Hollywood to make Green Mansions . He had high hopes that this would be the hit picture which had eluded him ever since his elevation to starring parts . He also hoped for at least a modest red-carpet reception from the studio now that he was a star . Instead , he was n't even al  --  lowed through the gate . " 1 went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " because that 's the gate I went through when I was in The Actress . So I said , ' Green Mansions . I 'd like to go through . ' ' What 's your name ? ' ' Tony Perkins . ' ' Tony Perkins ? Are you a na  --  tive bearer ? ' ' No , I 'm a featured player . ' I just did n't want to say , ' I 'm the star . Let me in or I 'll have you fired . ' ' Well , ' the man said , ' you ca n't go through this gate . ' Finally one of the casting directors walked by , and he got me in . " Tony loved working with Audrey Hep  --  burn , but he had " some very heated dis  --  agreements " with Mel Ferrer , Audrey 's husband , who directed . Tony has always been an actor who wants close guidance from the director , but once he questioned Ferrer so persistently about how he wanted a certain scene played that , since the film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left out entirely . And , Tony says , " He angrily accused me of deliberately asking so many questions that we lost the scene . " indeed , what made the incident particularly galling to Ferrer was the knowledge that Tony had thought all along the scene should be dropped . Long before this , however , Tony had resigned himself to the fact that Green Mansions would be his sixth starring pic  --  ture in a row without a hit . As a result he was all the more anxious that On the Beach should not make a seventh , and he and Stanley Kramer spent long hours polishing Tony 's part before the actor left for Australia in January of last year . The picture is woven from three parallel plots of about equal importance . " Tony had some misgivings , " Kramer says , " be  --  cause his was n't the starring role . " And Perkins wanted to be very sure about his own part . " With a relatively small part , " Tony says , " every word has to be just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other script I 've ever worked on . " During these sessions he found Kramer warm , friendly and co-operative . Thus he was thoroughly disconcerted to discover that in Melbourne the director had be  --  come " gruff , short , sarcastic. 1 thought , God , I 've made the mistake of the age . It was like some old bo- , rding-sehool story : When the mother comes , the man rubs his hands and says , ' Yes , we 're going to be wonderful friends . ' Then just as soon as she leaves , it 's into the pits with the seven hundred starving urchins . " But if Kramer 's disposition was testy he had ample cause in the special prob  --  lems posed by shooting the picture in Australia . One of these involved the ne  --  cessity of setting up police barricades to keep the streets empty for scenes showing a lifeless city . The police were happy to oblige , Kramer explains , but the rest of the townsfolk " resented interference with their inalienable rights to cross the street and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popularity reached its low  --  est point on the Sunday when one over-officious member of the constabulary re  --  fused to let a minister cross the street to get to his own church , delaying services for forty minutes . Equally annoying for Kramer and his companions was the Australian insect population . January is midsummer in Melbourne , and the flies were out in force , especially on the beaches where certain scenes had to be shot . It became necessary , in fact , to hire a man with a machine which sprayed forth large clouds of fly repellent . " And for thirty seconds thereafter , " says Tony . " the flies would be stunned . So the order of the day would be , ' O.K. , everybody ready . Hand on switch . Fly man ! ' And then , swoosh  --  you could n't see your hand in front of your face . There would be a deathly silence . a few coughs , and we would wait for this stuff to drift away ; and then , : ing  --  we would do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back . " Most trying of all in some ways was the fact that their sound stage for interior scenes had been improvised from a build  --  ing at the local fairgrounds formerly used to show livestock . It was impossible to soundproof . This proved to be all the more unsettling because a few hundred yards away was the city 's harness-racing track , and nearer still , much of the time , was Billy Graham . Many an otherwise unblemished take was ruined by the shouts of repentant sinners and unre  --  pentant horse players . Only once were the tables turned . In one scene Fred Astaire commits suicide by locking him  --  self in his garage and revving up the engine of his beloved Ferrari racing car . This makes quite a racket in the picture , but it made a great deal more in actuality , and , says Stanley Kramer with unholy satisfaction , " We nearly blew Billy Graham right out of Australia . " Despite such small diversions , how  --  ever . life proved fairly dull for the film company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " There was al  --  ways a slight feeling of wanting to be home . " In addition there was little to do after a day 's shooting . Night life in Mel  --  bourne is almost nonexistent . " Every  --  thing closes at six , " Tony says . " And they have what is known as the ' Six O'Clock Swill . ' People line up with buck  --  ets and old hats and shoes and they just pour in the beer and then they sit and drink it  --  because the lock eoes on at six . " Generally Tony had dinner with Donna Anderson , who plays his wife in the pic  --  ture . " Tony was a tremendous eater , " she says . " He kept saying something about a diet he was on , but he would often have five or six helpings of some  --  thing he liked . " And by the time they were through eating , " it was just like the blitz was on , " says Tony . " Black . No sign of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Stanley 's and play poker . I never played before , but I loved to play , It 's not like money when you 're playing with pounds ; it 's just paper . I ended up winning the equivalent of about three hundred American dollars . " Returning to America . Tony started almost immediately preparing for his part in Joshua Logan 's nil/ Slurs. , in which he plays a naive and studious college basket  --  ball star . " It is a type , " says Logan , " that has been used for many years  --  the schnook . But Tony takes this threadbare type and makes it into something human and believable and completely his own . " Logan feels that Tony 's range is ex  --  iraordmars . ' ' He can be oddly comic , vicious , charming , evil , joyful , innocent , sophisticated , tender and poetic , stupid and bumbling  --  all these things and many more  --  at will . All he needs is a little suggestion from the director . " So im  --  pressed is Logan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes Tony will be free to play the lead in the film version of Moss Hart 's autobiography . . - Ict One , movie rights to which Logan has purchased . Thai is still a long way in the future , however . Meanwhile , Tony is keeping busy . Late last November he started work on an Alfred Hitchcock picture called Psycho , the style of which can perhaps best be described as Hitchcock Macabre . After this , if all goes well , he will fulfill a I II LI king-standing , ambition to do a Broad  --  way musical . This show , which opens in Philadelphia later this month , is Frank Loesser 's Greenwilloir , and it will be Tony 's only singing part except for a television show culled Joey , which he did shortly after finishing Friendly Persuasion in 1955 . Tony enjoys singing ; and for a while after Joey he made records for the Epic label and later for RCA Victor , Hut he got out of recording because he had to spend so siuch time promoting his records . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " but to be a recording SATURDAY RVENING POST star you 've got to be only a recording star . t think if I had devoted myself to it , I would , you know , be as good as anybody , But it was n't worth that much to me . " For better or worse , Tony 's future seems to lie mainly in motion pictures . If he can make the difficult transition to mature parts , there should be no limit to his success . But , as William Wyler says , " Tony should watch now and be very careful . Audiences arc fickle . He should choose carefully . It 's hard to look good in a lousy picture .

Many other Mountaineer players have come from road crossings in the hills  --  they probably are the only basketballers booked into New York who spend their evenings playing pool instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however . the " hick " label had a special meaning . Jerry himself says he was painfully backward when he first enrolled at Vest Virginia . Today he remains introverted , although he is far from a dullard . He is an intelli  --  gent , intense , complicated young man of twenty-one . Last season West made every body 's All . America team . He was named most valu  --  able player in the Southern Conference . He was an overwhelming " most valu  --  able " choice in the National Collegiate Athletic Association championship tour  --  nament , stealing the show from Cincin  --  nati 's Oscar Robertson . Yet at season 's end he remained in many respects a most unhappy fellow . At Morgantown , where the university is located , Jerry hides out like a recluse in his apartment or in movie theaters . He shuns campus hangouts , belongs to no fraternity . " People keep asking questions all the Lime , everywhere I go , " Jerry complains . He speaks with a twang , but so rapidly that his words tumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , he cracks the knuckles of his long , slender fingers one by one . " In Cabin Creek I cai n't go into the poolroom without somebody wanting to buy me a beer . When 1 go over to Charleston it 's really something  --  people stop me with questions every  --  where i go . Sometime I just do n't want to talk to any body . " Jerry is not by nature a grumpy person nor a snobbish one . It simply happens that he is the foremost athletic celebrity in a state where basketball is almost a holy cause . For instance , Elmer David Bruner , a convict awaiting electrocution in the state penitentiary , offered one of his eyes last season to First-stringer Bucky Bolyard , who is almost totally blind in one eye , The offer was declined  --  Bucky was , after all , shooting at better than 50 per cent accuracy and could afford to leave well enough alone . Such examples of West Virginia basket  --  ball fanaticism are as profuse as the timber in the hills around Morgantown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man like Jerry West should suffer inner turmoil . " It 's no good , thinking basketball all the time , " says Jerry . " That 's why I go to see the same movies twice , They cai n't get at you in the movies . " Unlike most campus athletes , who are social lions with the coed population , Jerry seldom dated until his junior year . It was then that an attractive brownette named Janey Kane unsettled him when they net in a class . Her secret was simple . " She did n't even know l was a basketball player , " Jerry explains . They began to date , and Janey began going to the games : but regardless of how magnificently Jerry played , Janey re  --  mained outwardly unimpressed . Jerrycon  --  I HI ued to hideout in movies , but not alone . On the basketball court Jerry West presents a different sort of enigma . He seems unable to play anywhere near his best unless faced with a challenge . If he is being guarded by an All-American , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the Mountaineers are trailing by fifteen points , then Jerry will explode . But if the opposition is mediocre , he can  --  not find his touch . Fourteen of the Mountaineers ' twenty-nine victories last season were come  --  from-behind rumpuses . Jerry averaged only 22 points m the easy games . but 30.2 in the close ones . He also averaged more points on the road than at home , al  --  though home is where the help is  --  going into the current season , West Virginia had won thirty-three consecutive games in Mountaineer Field House , a cramped , vertical shell in which 6800 screaming fans bear down on the visiting team , creating a bedlam that is frightening . Perhaps the most significant dividend from West 's clutch play is the over-all ef  --  fect it has had on West Virginia Univer  --  sity basketball . Until he carried the Mountaineers all the way to the finals of the national championships last March , they hada reputation for beingachoke-up outfit . Year in and year out West Vir  --  ginia had rolled through the so-so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draft horses mows a field . Having won the conference championship , the Moun  --  taineers would then be shipped to Madi  --  son Square Garden , New York , to com  --  pete in the first round of the N.C.A.A. eastern regionals . And here their season promptly would end . In 1955 LaSalle eliminated them in the first round , In 1956 it was Dartmouth  --  Ivy Leaguers , of all people . In 1957 Cani  --  sius applied a swift kick to the West Vir  --  ginia posterior , and in 1958 Manhattan did likewise . Each year West Virginia had excuses , but its reputation for failure in the N.C.A.A. tournament became deeply galling to coach Fred Schaus . Last March , as his team prepared to open against Dartmouth in its annual pil  --  grimage to Madison Square Garden , con  --  servative Schaus said , " We 've run out of excuses . I think this is our year . " Schaus , of course , had Jerry West go  --  ing for him . Even though West injured a leg early in the Dartmouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an g2-to-6k victory . West and West Virginia had killed the jinx and were on their way . The Mountaineers tire-engined their way through the play  --  offs as follows . WEST VIRGINIA 95 , ST . JOSEPH 'S 92 Jerry whipped in fourteen points in less than four minutes to help wipe out an eighteen-point lead held by the Hawks with only thirteen minutes remaining . WEST VIRGINIA 86 , BOSTON UNIVER SITY 82 ? Jerry demolished a Boston lead by scoring eight-straight points in one minute and fifty-nine seconds and had a twenty-point second half . WEST VIRGINIA 94 , LOUISVILLE 79 Jerry registered twenty-seven points in the first half and then , lacking the chal  --  lenge of stern opposition , took only six shots in the second half . In the championship game against California he came off the bench under the inhibition of four personal fouls and led a zone press that cut the Bears ' thirteen-point margin to a single point . He scored twenty-eight points playing part time . Although California won out , 71-70 , Jerry had erased the choke-up stigma and restored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many had looked upon West Virginia as a vaude  --  ville troupe featuring Hot Rod Hundley and four straight men . Dribbling the ball between his legs , spinning it on his index finger and grinning impishly at the oppo  --  sition , Hot Rod packed in crowds wher  --  ever the Mountaineers traveled from 1954 to 1957 . He was the box-office champ and , as Coach Schaus will tell you , he was one heck of a basketball player too . But what Coach Schaus wo n't tell you is that it almost made him sick to coach a team known more for its shenanigans than its technical excellence . In the Jerry West era all this has changed . West stands just six feet , two-and-a  --  half inches and weighs a skimpy 174 pounds . Only his wide , athletic shoulders dispel the suspicion of malnutrition . However , his jump shot is deadly , his re  --  actions panther-quick . Most extraordi  --  nary of all is his ability to jump high into the air . By actual measurement  --  and this is amazing for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches higher than the rim of the basket . His jumping accounts for many re  --  bounds and also enables him on defense to repulse assaults with a finality that often takes the tight out of the opposi  --  tion . His defensive trade-mark is the same as that of the giants of professional basketball , seven-foot-one-inch Wilt Chamberlain of the Philadelphia Warriors and six-foot-ten Bill Russell of the Boston Celtics . As the enemy shooter goes up for a shot , West goes up with him and blocks the ball as easily as picking an apple off a low-hanging bough . Moreover , he is apt to come down with the ball and start a fast break to the opposing basket , leaving a frustrated shooter behind . " We were playing The Citadel last sea  --  son , " Coach Schaus recalls . " One of their guys had had shots blocked by Jerry several times during the game . Finally they had three men corning down the floor and only Jerry to stop them  --  a three-on-one situation , No , I think it was four-on-one . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle man , who had the ball . The middle man passed off to the guy on his left and , as he started to shoot , Jerry switched to him . This was the guy whose shots Jerry had been blocking all night .
