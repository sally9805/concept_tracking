THE PRESIDENCY <P> In 1960 Philadelphia gave John Kennedy a 331,500-vote plurality , more than enough to offset losses elsewhere in Pennsylvania and put the state into the Democratic column . Last week the President went to Philadelphia to repay that political debt . He was given a frosty reception . <P> Kennedy had come to campaign for Mayor James Tate , up for re-election this week and under heavy criticism from many whites for his acquiescence to demands of militant Negro organizations . As the Kennedy caravan moved the 13 miles from the Philadelphia airport , most streets were virtually deserted . There was little waving or cheering . Outside the Bellevue Stratford Hotel , where Kennedy appeared at a $250-a-head reception , pickets waved signs- " Kennedy , Why Compromise Equality ? " Then on to Convention Hall . There the signs warned " We Will Barry You , " and inside , the galleries were half empty even though some 10,000 free tickets had been distributed . <P> Kennedy laid his blessings on Tate , ticked off achievements of his Administration , and made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " is still very much with us , and it will continue to be with us until all Americans of every race can regard one another with the quality for which this city is noted-brotherly love . " <P> Back in Washington , the President sent a bouquet and congratulations to his maternal grandmother , Mrs. John F. Fitzgerald , who marked her 98th birthday in Boston . Looking forward to next year 's vacations , the White House announced that the First Family had leased Annandale Farm on Narragansett Bay at Newport , R.I. , for the months of August and September . Annandale , the same estate that a group of Rhode Islanders wanted to buy and present to Kennedy as a permanent summer White House in 1962 , will replace the First Family 's summer home at Squaw Island in Hyannis Port . The new digs , for which the Kennedys reportedly will pay $2,000 a month , has 22 acres , a swimming pool , nearly a dozen bedrooms , and seclusion behind high brick walls . It adjoins the estate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugh D. Auchincloss , where Jackie played when she was a teenager .
