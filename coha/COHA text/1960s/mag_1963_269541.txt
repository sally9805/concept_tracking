Italy , at last count , had 40,000 native-born saints recognized by the Roman Catholic Church . The U.S. , the nation with the world 's second largest Catholic population ( after Brazil ) , has none , * but one is in the making . This week in Rome , following Vatican approval of two miracles attributed to her intervention with God-one a medically inexplicable cure of cancer , the other a recovery from leukemia-Elizabeth Ann Bayley Seton , founder of the American branch of the worldwide order known as the Daughters of Charity , was enrolled among the beatified of the church . Attending the formal ceremonies at St. Peter 's were more than 3,000 American pilgrims , including Cardinals Spellman and Ritter and 15-year-old Anne O'Neill of Baltimore , whose leukemia cure is attributed to prayers to Mother Seton . <P> From Fashion to Faith . Elizabeth Seton was born in 1774 to the Bayley family of pre-Revolutionary New York . Her father was a doctor , and her family was related to some of the great Dutch pioneer families-the Roosevelts and the Van Cortlandts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Raised as an Episcopalian , pretty Betty Bayley was a gay , open girl who loved dances and parties . At 19 , she married William Magee Seton. heir to a New York mercantile fortune , in the biggest social event of the 1794 season . The Rt . Rev. Samuel Provoost , first Protestant Episcopal Bishop of New York , officiated at the ceremony . <P> The Setons settled down in a fashionable home near the Battery . But by the turn of the century , William Seton 's fortune had collapsed , and so had his health . On their doctor 's advice , they went to Italy in 1803 , where Seton hoped to recoup his health and financial losses . There he died , leaving Betty Seton. at 29 , a nearly penniless widow with five children . <P> Italian friends introduced her to Catholicism ; she formally converted to the faith in 1805 after her return to New York , and found that this apostasy shut society 's doors to her . In desperation , she opened a boardinghouse for schoolboys in New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more Catholic city of Baltimore . In 1809 , she formed a religious community of women at Emmitsburg , , Md . There she started what was , in effect , the first Catholic parochial school in the U.S. By the time she died , of tuberculosis , in 1821 , her tiny order had expanded to ten houses . In 1850 , it united with the Daughters of Charity , founded by France 's St. Vincent de Paul . <P> God or a Cup of Coffee . Busy , bird-like Mother Seton was a woman both stern and sentimental . As a girl , she was wildly eclectic in her spiritual life , combining deep faith in the Episcopal Church with love for such scandalous deists as Voltaire and Rousseau . Tough when she had to be . Mother Seton fought priestly superiors who crossed her path , alternately teased and bullyragged her two sons . When one of her nuns failed to receive Communion because she had broken her fast with a cup of coffee . Mother Seton showed little sympathy . " Ah , my dear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God for a miserable cup of coffee ? ' '
