The trouble with painkilling drugs is that the more effectively they do their job , the more likely they are to cause addiction . Morphine is the outstanding example , and medical chemists have been trying since the turn of the century to produce an equally potent but nonaddicting painkiller . Time and again they have been disappointed , but last week their hopes rose once more . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration was ready to approve release of a new analgesic that New York 's Winthrop Laboratories say is " in the morphine range of potency " but is nonnarcotic-and , they hope , nonaddicting . <P> Developed by two Winthrop chemists , Dr. Sydney Archer and Dr. Noel Albertson , the drug has the chemical name pentazocine and is trade-named Talwin . In six years , it has been tested on 12,000 patients and has relieved severe pain associated with surgery , injuries , cancer , childbirth , bone diseases arthritis and dental conditions . The pa- tients obtained about as much relief a they would have from morphine , but did not require increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dizziness , were usually mild . Government agencies are not yet willing to say flatly that pentazocine is nonaddicting , but they say it does not " support addiction " and need not be put under narcotic controls . <P> Distribution of pentazocine is expected to begin in about a month . At first it will be available only for injection but Winthrop expects to apply later this year for approval of an oral , tablet form .
