THE SADDEST SUMMER OF SAMUEL S by J. P. Donleavy. 124 pages . Delacorte Press . $3.95 . <P> <P> In Candide , Voltaire wrote for all time the story of the philosophic fathead betrayed by blind optimism and an overweening trust in the goodness of human nature . J. P. Donleavy 's conte philosophique demonstrates that the things a man does not believe in can be as crippling as false faith . This is the opposite of Candide 's optimism-despair . Donleavy 's hero , Samuel S , does not suffer persecution by savages ; his enemy is himself ; he believes nothing . <P> Mr. S , a man of some eminence in the U.S. literary world , is , at 40 , in his fifth year of psychoanalysis in Vienna . His most obvious problems are love and money . A countess offers him a permanent income as an opera escort and house pet . An American girl student offers love and even to take care of his frowsty digs . He refuses both , and his analyst gives him up as a bad job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says : " This final session has given me the biggest insight of all . That if I am ever cured , I will never know it . " The book ends with S in a state of collapse-nullity has been achieved . <P> S should be a dull dog but is not ; he is the liveliest of loonies . High-spirited writing about a low-spirited man is rare enough to raise hopeful questions about Donleavy 's future as a writer . In Ginger Man , he wrote an irresistible Dublin farce ; in A Singular Man , he created a fantasy figure of power , wealth and charm , who could do everything but was concerned mainly with building a mausoleum to defeat death . In Mr. S , he has created a man who can do nothing but accept death . S , at a fair guess , stands for " singular , " and in his singularity lies man 's doom . Donleavy is a natural comedian who achieves his black effects by means as economical as those of a gifted mime doing a skit on a deathbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his next novel should be worth waiting for .
