" Only Mr. Armstrong , who turned 39 years old during the quarantine , paused at a microphone to address the crowd . After thanking his hosts  --  the technicians running the laboratory ? Mr. Armstrong smiled and said : " I ca n't say I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'm very glad we got the opportunity to complete the mission . " Then the three astronauts drove away in separate station wagons for reunions with their families for the first time since before the launching of Apollo 11 on July 16 . Their wives and children were not at the laboratory . Dr. Charles A. Berry , director of medical research and operations , said that the three men // were in excellent health and showed no signs of having picked up any strange lunar organisms . It was Dr. Berry who broke the clear plastic seal on the door leading to the quarantine quarters . The astronauts were first greeted inside the building by officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration . The astronauts were placed in quarantine immediately after their splashdown in the Pacific Ocean July 24 on the off chance that they might have brought back a moon germ against which people on earth had no immunity . They were first placed in an airtight house trailer on the aircraft carrier Hornet . This was their home for three days while they were being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests , however , no moon germs were found .

Twenty other people who had worked in the quarantine ' area with the astronauts followed them out the door . Each carried handbags and autographed pictures of the Apollo II crewmen . Dr. Berry ordered their release after a lengthy session with doctors at the Public Health Service 's Communicable Disease Center in Atlanta , during which they reviewed all the medical data on the astronauts . After a day with their families , the astronauts are scheduled to begin a strenuous week of news conferences , parades and other celebrations . At 11 A.M. , Eastern daylight time , on Tuesday , the three men will describe their historic mission at a news conference here at the Manned Spacecraft Center .

Afterward , they will fly to Los Angeles for a state dinner at which President Nixon will be the host . And on Saturday they will receive their official heroes ' welcome in Houston , which will include a show at the Astrodome directed by David Merrick , the Broadway producer . All Manned Spacecraft Center employes , Apollo industrial contractors and others who participated in making the flight possible will be the honored guests . Dr. Berry said that he would not be surprised if the three astronauts came down with some earth-type illness , like the common cold , during the next week . He explained that the astronauts had been isolated from the world for so long in a relatively germ-free atmosphere that they would be quite susceptible to disease . For the next year , the Apollo 11 astronauts and all those who lived in quarantine with them will be monitored for any sign of lunar illness .                    @
