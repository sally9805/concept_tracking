" Most people feel that because we are nuns we have lost our appreciation for feminine matters , " says Sister Lorenzina of Rome 's Catholic Pious Society of the Daughters of St. Paul . " Quite the contrary . A woman remains a woman even after she takes the veil . If she lost her feminine soul , she would become a cold , sterile human being . " <P> Sister Lorenzina has practical proof for her point : listed on the masthead by her given name of Olga Guidetti , she is the editor of a not-quite-slick-paper magazine named Cosi ( Thus ) , which is published and staffed by the Daughters of St. Paul and is a successful weekly entry in the fiercely competitive Italian field of popular magazines for women . <P> Skirting the Stars . Cosi , along with its rivals , has no real counterpart in U.S. journalism ; it combines the fashion-consciousness of an especially demure Vogue with the love stories of a particularly sedate Redbook , the gossip columns of the less sensational U.S. movie magazines with the diet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its features is a weekly horoscope ; Cosi skirts church objections with a cautionary footnote reminding readers that human will is independent of the stars . <P> Established in 1955 by Don Giacomo Alberione , now 75 , founder of the Society of St. Paul , a progressive order that uses such modern means as movies , radio and TV to spread the word of Christ , Cosi competes on nonsecular terms . By its low price-Cosi sells for 50 lire ( 8 ) , about half the going rate-and by a vigorous door-to-door selling campaign , the Daughters of St. Paul say they have pushed the magazine 's circulation to 300,000 , respectably close to the two leaders in the crowded Italian women 's field , Grazia and Annabella , each with about 400,000 circulation . <P> One recent week two of Cosi 's blackhabited staffers sat among the smartly dressed buyers at a high-fashion show in Rome . As the models in chic suits , lowcut evening gowns and bathing suits walked by , the sisters , looking a bit like ravens at a parade of cockatoos , exchanged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they stepped into Cosi 's staff car , a blue Fiat , and drove away to their walled convent on Rome 's southern side . There they produced a sprightly and authoritative review of the latest modes . <P> Editing with Care . When the sisters are given bylines for their articles , their given names are always used . There is a good reason for such policy : Cosi 's ten sister-staffers want their magazine to stand as more than a conventual oddity . Says Sister Lorenzina : " We take great care in editing so that readers should not see that Cosi is obviously done by nuns . By publishing a gay and amusing magazine- always within the concepts of Christian morality and modesty-we try to attract readers who would otherwise buy lay publications which are often scandalous and harmful to morals .
