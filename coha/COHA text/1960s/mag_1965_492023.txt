Miss Clairol 's original half-milliondollar advertising budget for that year 1954- went to a million almost immediately , and has risen every year since .

Since Foote , Cone 's income derives mostly from a 15-cent commission on every dollar a client spends for advertising , the agency has done nicely too . Four nut of 10 American women now color their own hair or have it colored for them , and they spend for this purpose more than a half billion dollars a year .

Doyle Dane is a low-pressure operation commanding vast loyalty from employees who have felt their ambitions and creative impulses smothered elsewhere . " Do n't talk to me about this shop , " says one young account executive . " I 'm a zealot , We 're all zealots . " But it is not a democracy . To a large degree it is the lengthened shadow of Bill Bembach , a rather small , soft-spoken man of 53 , who has a gentle smile and a deliberately unprepossessing manner . Bernbach got his start in the public-relations department of the first New York World 's Fair , and he and Ned Doyle and Maxwell Dane opened their own little agency in 19,19 . I-Es salary is now $115,000 a year , and last year , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his wife sold one quarter of their holdings in it for about one and a half million dollars . The agency 's clients include Volkswagen , Polaroid , U.S. Royal Tires , Canadian Lord Calvert and Four Roses , American Airlines , Sony , and Avis ; Berl-Mach also handled the advertising end of President Johnson 's campaign . While Doyle and Dane handle the clients , Bernbach runs the part of the shop that turns out the " product . " No committee looks over the ads before they go to the clients ; I3ernbach approves them himself . He will not submit a choice of possible advertising campaigns to a client , and he does not want to see a batch of suggestions from his own people  --  he asks for the one approach they think is best . " They 're not selling me ties , " he says . " They 're selling me ideas , which are hard to come by . I 've taught them to think it out first , before they come to me . " S till , nearly all problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Bernbach 's desk for quick resolution . He returned to his modest office from lunch the other day , an hour before he had to leave to catch a plane , and the line formed outside his door . The door is open , and people walk in to sit in one of the five chairs at the small round table that serves Bernbach as a desk . The man first in the door was the traffic manager , who has the problem of making sure the work gets out on time . ( " The worst job in the agency , " Bernbach says . " The traffic department has to go in and tell people they have n't done their work , and nobody likes to hear the truth about himself . " ) A senior copywriter was heading out of town for a week to work on a major campaign for American Airlines , and there was a deadline coming up in another of his accounts ; the traffic manager wanted authorization to put someone else on it . Bernbach refused . " This is Dan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's get that deadline pushed back . If the client says it ca n't be done , tell him to get in touch with me . " Next came an art director and a bearded copywriter , unhappy because a client wanted his corporate name more prominent in the ad than it was in the original layout . The account executive , who meets daily with the client 's advertising manager , was pressing the art director to go along . " We 've got enough friction from the outside , with this client , " said the art director , " without having internal friction , " Bernbach MADISON AVENUE agreed to talk with the account executive ; the original layout would stand . Another team of art director and copywriter entered with the layout of an ad which they had wanted to run as a " bleed page " in a magazine  --  a picture extending to the edge of the page . - Bleed pages " cost up to 15 percent extra , and the client was unhappy . Bernbach ruled that the idea of the illustration for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the product , and this notion could he conveyed only if the picture ran to the edge . The client would have to go along . An account supervisor came in to discuss with Bernbach the presentation they would make together to the New York Racing Association , which was considering Doyle Dane as the agency to handle its racetrack advertising . Which of the many Bernbach success stories should he stress ? Bernbach reached immediately for his favorite campaign , the ads for SANE . which he took away from scare photos of mushroom clouds , substituting a picture of Dr. Spock with a child " Dr. Spock is worried " ) . Like the nuclear-disarmament people , the racetrack people had been advertising to those who were already interested . If they came to Doyle Dane , Bernbach would look for a way to reach potential racegoers who did n't already know what was running in the seventh  --  and would use television rather than the sports pages of the newspapers to carry the message . A lady copywriter came in with an art director and a suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernbach liked parts of it , but not the proposed name for theproduct . Very gently he sent his people back to work , presumably taking the burden on himself . " I 'd like to think a little more about that name . " Another lady copywriter then entered , alone . with a layout for Ohrbach 's , a New York and Los Angeles department store which was one of the agency 's original clients in 1949 . The ad was for the annual clearance sale , and it showed a long-haired girl asleep on a pillow . The headline read : TOMORROW , THIS Is ONE LUXURY YOU CA N'T AFFORD . like it very much , " said Bernbach . " But let 's change that headline . Let 's make it read . IF YOU DO THIS TOMORROW , IT WILL COST YOU MONEY. - About 45 minutes had elapsed . Bernbach excused himself and went downstairs to take the limousine to the airport . No other advertising agency works quite this way , partly because no other agency has so completely a dominant yet universally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same basic objective of moving merchandise . Behind the hoopla surrounding the business is the simple fact that advertising is selling writ large ; the adman with his presentation case full of layouts , bar charts and other esoterica offers a much faster and cheaper way of reaching customers than the traveling drummer with his case of samples . Good advertising can " cost out " to an advertiser at a fantastically low price per sale , and achieve all kinds of selling objectives . It can make customers notice a new product amid a profusion of existing brands . It can be used to keep pressure on a consumer , to keep a familiar brand name firmly in her head . It can maintain the morale ( and selling efficiency ) of dealers . " People think we sponsor ball games because men driving in cars listen to ball games , " says the man who runs the advertising department of an oil company . " But the major reason is that the man who works the service station keeps the radio on and it gives him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " T he difficulty  --  and the fascination  --  of advertising is that no one really knows how or why it works . It operates invisibly . at a distance , and there is no salesman 's order book to tell the accounting department what is going on . The relationship between the ad on paper or picture tube and the sale in the supermarket or discount house is almost undiscoverable , except for department-store pages , mail-order coupon ads and the occasional blockbuster . A shopper may buy because she saw and believed an ad  --  or because the package is pretty , because Aunt Tillie said it was great , or because the dealer is pushing it extra hard ( having been promised a free trip to Jamaica if he outsells other dealers ) . " When you advertise . " says Daniel Seymour , president of J. Walter Thompson , the nation 's largest agency , " you can get back ten cents on the dollar or ten dollars on the dollar , depending on your ad . " A recent study proclaims that 85 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depresses some admen but exhilarates others who look at the 15 percent doughnut instead of the 85 percent hole . It is the uncertain nature of the game which gives color and variety to the agency business , a small " industry " centering on Madison Avenue but no longer rushing to concentrate there . Only about 60.000 people work in ad agencies . including office boys and receptionists , and a hundred agencies write and place virtually all the " national " advertising for brand-name products . But this relatively small world seethes with an astounding assortment of competitive crosscurrents , contradictory statistics and clashing theories . It is full of people with titles like " vice president , creative , " and " research coordinator , " and no two men above the third-echelon level are likely to define their jobs exactly the same way . Success breeds success at a furious rate , and fads sweep the business like brush fires ; at the moment , ad agencies are evoking the Bengal tiger on behalf of a hall dozen products ranging from tires to hair tonic . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent on selling goods to the ultimate consumer but on selling themselves , their ideas or the power of the publications and broadcasting stations they represent . The " media salesman " makes his rounds asking the agencies ' " media buyers " to have confidence in the selling leverage of the minute on his network or the page in his magazine . Inside the agency the copywriter and the art director try to sell their selling arguments to the account executive and to win his confidence . The account executive implores the confidence of the client company 's advertising manager that the agency has solved his problems . The ad manager . in turn , must convince his top management that he is finding his way amid the many imponderables of the market place " out there . " Since everyone is groping to some extent , image is vital and words alone may seem like runic talismans with the power to guide . One big agency , in presenting itself to potential clients , speaks of its abilities to build a " selling pl  --  tform " for products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product positioning , " - cogwheel concept , " " unique selling proposition , " ' ' empathy , " and " total marketing " ? slogans seeking to distinguish what are essentially identical services . David Ogilvy , a pipe-smoking import from England who tied the eye patch on the Man in the Hathaway Shirt and built one of the 20 largest U.S. agencies , puts the ultimate wish fulfillment of the men whopay for advertising into his pitch for Ogilvy , Benson &; Mather . This is a single sentence , said ratherquickly to keep the face straight : " Thoroughness plus brilliance equals more sales for less advertising . " Perhaps the best dictum  --  if dicta have any place in the business  --  was handed down 50 years ago by a near-legendary copywriter named Claude Hopkins , who declared that good advertising gives people a " reason why " ( to buy the product ) . An established brand name is itself a " reason why , " since the customer knows a company is putting a considerable investment on the line with every shipment it sends out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the product , of course ; if people buy it for the kids , the commercial should be gay and tuneful , and if they buy it to cure a headache , the commercial should make the headache feel worse . " Tiny time pills " and a " final filter " are . like most successful campaign slogans , boiled-down reasons to single out a product . A good deal of agency work goes into convincing the public that there are distinctions between products which are virtually indistinguishable . chemically speaking . As Rosser Reeves of Bates once put it , " A client comes into my office and throws two newly minted half dollars onto my desk and says , ' Mine is the one on the left . You prove it 's better . ' " This job is not impossible , nor is it so cynical as it seems . Products do , in fact , become different once they are wrapped in different packages , and once they are shown in different lights . Soap , for example , may be soap  --  but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wrapped cake of Palmolive to put it on film is anything but a simple , routine job . A youthful man with gray hair , Mitzman is in charge of producing all the TV commercials the Bates agency makes for Colgate , and he spends a good part of his time in the studio of a film outfit called Televideo , high up in a loft building on Manhattan 's West Side . While Mitzman watched from his canvas captain 's chair not long ago , a staff of eight cameramen and technicians lined up a shot of a package of Palmolive which had been inserted into what seemed to be a sheet of black glass ( actually , it was clear glass , unimaginably clean , with a velvet drop to provide a black background I. This commercial had involved an air trip to Copenhagen to take pictures of a girl water-skiing , and then a morning at Televideo , shooting countless pictures of a girl washing her face . The corn-mercial was to end with the package hurtling from horizon to foreground , and that picture was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on tracks to focus on the soap , and men were moving big light stanchions about to get everything just right . Mitzman stepped over the tangle of wires and asked if he could n't have a look through the viewer . Then he said . " I ca n't see the stars on the bottom half of the package . We lose the stars on the bottom . " The heavy acoustical insulation of the room made his voice seem remote . New light stanchions were dragged into place . " Unlike most people , we use the actual wrap , " Mitzman explained , returning to his chair . " That 's a complicated lighting problem . Looks like foil , because it is foil ; but you 've got to be careful it does n't reflect stray light back into the camera , the way foil can do . " Mitzman looked affectionately at the Televideo crew . " Ten years ago . " he said , " for a top Hollywood cameraman , TV was like VD . Now the diet is more varied . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , a few years back , there was this program where the star of the commercial also appeared in the show . The show was failing . The client came to the production house and said . ' Ca n't we unsoup these commercials , please ? They 're killing our show . ' " Up by the bar of soap , one of the technicians said . " You want this crease taken out , do n't you ? " " Sure , would like that out , " Mitzman said cheerfully . He said , " You know , the TV producer at the agency used to be a guy you handed a board to and said , ' You go produce this . ' Now he 's a guy with a master 's or a Ph.D . in theater . He 's been a film director , he 's been in TV production for shows , he 's worked in the theater . He can write , he can certainly rewrite , he 's articulate ; he has to be a businessman , and he has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes the credit for it . If it bombs , there 's one man alone in the big void , and that 's the producer . But that 's the name of the game , you get paid for it . " More than an hour had passed since the camera was first lined up to the bar of soap . Now three men were holding lights just so , and Mitzman was invited to look again . He returned to his seat , not saying anything . " What do you think ? " said the cameraman rather nervously . " I think we ought to roll , " said Mitzman . And a package of Palmolive soap was forever enshrined on 40 feet of film . C ounting all costs , this commercial probably ran Colgate close to $20.000 . At least half a million dollars would be spent for time on which to show it . " People ask me , " Mitzman says , " whether I would n't like to direct feature films , rather than produce commercials . I tell them , ' Sure  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . ' If 1 made features the way I made commercials , they 'd all cost as much as Cleopatra . " To lower the odds and to bolster its confidence in placing such heavy bets . the advertising industry puts great trust in a huge statistical service commonly called " research . " A network TV salesman offering " $3 television " may need only make a phone call to sell his time to an agency , citing the Nielsen rating which indicates that a commercial minute on his show willreach a thousand homes for every $3 of cost . The same salesman peddling $5 television will buy an expensive lunch for the head of the agency 's media department and talk about how much people like his program ( quoting a research service called TvQ ) , or how well the buying habits of the audience match the product 's customer profile I quoting a number from a service called Pulse ) , or how well commercials associated with his program are remembered is number supplied by a service called Gallup &; Robinson ) . Planning a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ client 's business  --  agencies will exhaustively search out market research to find out who buys a product and why ; they will collect bales of computer-produced statistics to find the best media for ads , and run tests of actual copy that will tell them for sure which ads will sell goods . If the client on the other side of the table appears to be inexperienced or dull witted , they may say advertising is a " science . " A handful of senior admen have even managed to convince themselves . Research does buy better information than an adman could gain by studying his navel or his wife 's preferences ; indeed , the best advertising research , in areas of public buying and entertainment habits , is done by social scientists lured from the universities and is among the most impressive social research in America . With the development of mathematical model making , computers can be programmed with a history of past advertising efforts , prices , packages . dealer promotions , weather and other variables which affect sales . The machine can then churn through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of assumptions about them can be made to account for the sales record . But this is still not " science . " Good data on what actually happens in the world is hard to gel , and wrong data fed into the computer infallibly turns out cockeyed results . ( Computer technologists call it the GIGO system : " Garbage In , Garbage Out . " ) " You have to make sure the machine does n't make an ass of you , " says William T. Moran of Young &; Rubicam , which has more computer experience than any other agency , tracing back to 1957 . If you 're not careful , it can tell you about how to reach a market of red-headed Negro Mormons . " When Bill Bernbach had researchers test the Avis " We 're Only No. 2 " campaign on a sample of consumers , the testers came back with a thumbs-down recommendation on the grounds that Americans like to think of themselves as No. 1 people and do business with No. 1 companies . Bernbach brushed aside the advice and proceeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a money-loser into a profitable business . " Research can tell you which of five lousy campaigns is the least bad , " he says ; " it does n't help much with good advertising . " Few admen will go that far , although all would agree that there is a great deal of waste motion . " Not more than five percent of this material ever gets used , " says Norman B. Norman , a lean , marvelously self-confident , salesman whose Norman , Craig &; Kummel has produced , among other ads , the Maidenform dreamer , the Hertz levitator and the Ajax white tornado . " It just accumulates . The reason is this strange syndrome of modern managemcnt  --  if you do n't make major mistakes , you really can be president of the company some day . The guy who 's approving the advertising thinks , ' If anything goes wrong , I have to produce reasons for what I did , so the search will go past me . ' If he can show a research study to support him , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , there is apt to be a great deal of information which is really useful to a man trying to write an ad . Ironically , certain useful statistics turned up by computers have played a big part in pushing the " creative man " front and center in the business . " The more you work with computers , " says Young &; Rubicam 's Bill Moran , " the more obvious it is that the leverage in changing the media is in nickels and dimes , while the leverage in the creative end , in what the ads say , is in dollars . " The quantity of information about clients that gets stored away in the thousand-man offices of a big agency is also a stabilizer for the agency itself . The little agency does not make enough on commissions to pick up much marketing data . Its small clients , who must make each ad pay off , tend to grow restless easily , a tendency often encouraged by the proprietors of other small agencies who would like the business . " Running a small agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little like running a New York garage . Somebody comes in , he 's lost a hubcap from his car . So you send your boy out to steal a hubcap , and you put it on your customer 's car . Then the guy from whom you stole it comes in , he needs a hubcap , and you start again . There 's always cars on the streets without hubcaps . " In contrast , large and stable accounts like Ford , Du Pont and General Electric , to name a few , have worked with the same agencies for two decades . The four biggest agencies of 20 years ago are still the top four ( they are J , Walter Thompson , McCann-Erickson , Young &; Rubicam , and Batten , Barton , Durshine &; Osborn ) , and people who work on big accounts in such shops often come to know every corner of the client 's business . T hus , for example , Colin Campbell , executive vice president of Campbell-Ewald , the Detroit agency that handles Chevrolet , was discovered in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did you find out anything about that manifold-vacuum gauge ? " Campbell-Ewald 's organization chart for this one account has 43 boxes . In the boxes are seven vice presidents of the agency , a senior vice president , an executive vice president , and the chairman of the board . At least 300 people work regularly on the account . Located in the enormous General Motors Building which makes a separate downtown away from downtown Detroit , Campbell-Ewald is organized to function as an arm of Chevrolet . " Day by day , minute by minute , " says Campbell , " we 're downstairs , they 're upstairs . " Two dozen Campbell-Ewald people , " cleared for security , " saw the 1966 Chevrolets in November , 1964 , when the designers got the final mock-ups in comprehensible shape . Engineers , stylists and sales managers briefed the agency on how the new car would be different from the old . The agency 's artists talked over with the stylists the angles from which the car should be pictured . The agency 's " product-information division , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began a long series of sessions with the technical staff of Chevrolet , and started feeding ideas back to the 29 copywriters who work on Chevrolet alone , all year long , preparing about 150 different television commercials , almost as many radio commercials , 50 full-page newspaper ads , scores of ads for magazines , dozens of billboard designs , mailing pieces , and promotion booklets for the dealers . " I spend more time on quality control than on anything else , " says Henry ( Ted ) Little , a heavy , thoughtful man who is CampbellEwald 's chairman and direct commanding officer of the Chevrolet effort . In April , Little himself presents to the Chevrolet " advertising committee " fan august body chaired by the division 's MADISON AVENUE sales manager himself ) the advertising plan for the new-model year and ideas for the " announcement ads " to kick it off in the fall . In broad outlines , the Chevrolet claims are established for a long pull , within a main theme of " modernity and innovation . " But different cars need different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " traction story , " to be illustrated by the car starting up in snow ( for the North1 and in sand ( for the South ) . As the cheapest and smallest car in the line , its appeal is presumably to young people ; so while the full-size Chevy commercials have heavy movie music a la Tchaikovsky , Corvair has the Swingle Singers going doo-dah . After the unveiling day , the agency puts some hundreds of ears as close to the ground as they can get . Sales figures are scanned . Dealers are queried . Eminent academic researchers , like psychologist John Dollard of Yale , go to work questioning people on what they think of the car and the ads , and analyze the answers . Almost everybody connected with the account in any significant capacity goes out to the proving grounds and drives the new Chevies , Fords and Plymouths , looking for competitive arguments that can be used in the second round of ads . " You know what 's going on out there , " Campbell says . " The information is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop an ad for January . If a model does well , we know it immediately  --  and we have time to make ads for it while the client is filling the pipeline , getting to the textile mills for the fabric , that sort of thing . " Downstairs , the stylists are putting together the next year 's car  --  and slowly , attention shifts once again from the continuing pressure for the current car to the big plans for the next car . Conceivably , Chevrolet could take its $40-million-a-year account away from Campbell-Ewald , but it would be almost as much of a jolt for the company as it would for the agency ; scores of new people would have to be taught to recognize what Chevrolet wanted . There are still some large accounts that flit from place to place winning a beer account , " says a man who has won and lost them , " is like getting appointed manager of a baseball team " ) . Clients still feel the lure of the hot copywriter , the brilliant slogan , the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitor . But most clients know that the ingenious idea man probably ca n't help much until he has built a staff of people to feed him information . The creative man has gained stature and power in part because he has become less the free literary spirit and more the hard-working member of a team . W ith the ad business growing almost grimly businesslike , the more free-spirited admen are apt to be found in places far from Madison Avenue  --  places like the Minikanda Country Club in Minneapolis where agency head Ray Mithun took a business visitor on a weekday afternoon last fall . As he hit an arching No. 4 iron 175 yards over the dragon 's teeth of the sand trap guarding the 17th green , Mithun noticed a flight of ducks overhead coming down from Canada . " Boom ! " he said . " Boom , boom , BOOM ! Duck season opens in ten days . Half the men 'll be out of the office . " A tall , powerful man of 54 who looks a little like Barry Goldwater , Mithun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than $60 million of its clients ' money and is by far the largest agency west of the Mississippi . ( San Francisco and Los Angeles have somehow never developed large agencies . ) Its growth exemplifies the success of western agencies in holding off marauding New Yorkers who once seemed on the verge of capturing the ad business in toto . The westerners have been helped in reversing this trend by fast jet service and the banishment of ad agencies from television programming which reduces the advantage of a New York location . ( Network broadcasting has always been controlled from New York , but the days when Young &; Rubicam produced Fred Allen and J. Walter Thompson put on the Kraft Theatre are gone ; instead of seeking " sponsors " the networks now decide what they want to do with their time and sell the " minutes " to advertisers on a take-it-or-leave-it basis . ) New York is still the headquarters for 19 of the i5 top agencies , and admen still want the Big League experience .

At CampbellMithun. 34 out of 55 account executives are homegrown products of the agency , and 34 out of 50 copywriters got their start where they are now . As his agency grows and needs more people . Mithun uses all sorts of arguments to keep them there , including the proximity of good duck hunting . " We do n't have a pool of floating advertising manpower , " he says . " In New York , I could go over to the window and yell ' I need an account executive , ' and in five minutes there 'd be a dozen of them in my office . But if a man is wilting to come out here , the chances are he 's an alcoholic or lie 's got three wives  --  he 's escaping from something . So we 've had to raise our own .

Recently Knox Reeves has been expanding in all directions , and it even took a piece of Alberto-Culver business away from three New York agencies . The people who have handled the expansion are mostly returning Minnesotans . Generally , the advertising business works about the same way everywhere . But the tone is more relaxed . and it is hard to avoid the feeling that the ads are as a result a little more cheerful . Campbell-Mithun , for example , turns out the happy bear from the land of sky-blue waters for Hamm 's Beer and the grinning sharp-toothed molecule that eats oily dirt for Glass Wax . At Knox Reeves , Tom Kilbride came back from a vacation to find his office apparently gone  --  the night before his return . some boys in the art department had boarded up his door and painted it to match the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared from New York and Chicago , where the information How is heavier and the pressure is greater to blend the advertising agency into the normal operations of a big corporation . It is only a matter of time , of course , before the midwest agencies feel the same forces that are remaking the agencies in New York . Information flows both ways : As agencies learn more about client operations , clients learn more about agencies . Meanwhile , the computer does more than analyze media and perform esoteric mathematical research . It also keeps the agency 's books  --  and the agencies , for the first time , really know about themselves . The pioneer in the controlled , computerized agency operation is a tall , dark , firm man with a long face . William Marsteller , who in 1951 came out of the advertising department of the Rockwell Manufacturing Co. to start his own Chicago agency .

Significantly , Marsteffer operates en - nrely on a fee system , not on commissions .

" The lawyer and the accountant are always trying to save their client money , but the advertising man is under a conflict of interest , because his own income goes up if the client spends more . " Worse , it meant that an agency was paid according to how often an ad was run , and in which publications , rather than according to the work that went into it . T he situation has been aggravated by the new-product boom of recent years .

David Ogilvy has been the most vocal proponent of fees on the agency side , and says that in every case his negotiated fees have exceeded what he would have received in commissions . His agency now derives only 35 percent of its income from commissions . and the rest from fees . The breakthrough may have come last fall , when big conservative B.B.D.O. began notifying its clients that it planned to experiment with the fee system . " Running it off on the computer , " says B.B.D.O. chairman Charles Brower , " we found that some clients were eating our heart out , losing money for us year after year . In fact some clients are out to cheat agencies , and always have been . Well , now we feel pretty hold and big and strong . We 're over the fear that it 's like the olive bottle  --  if one of the olives comes out , they 'll all roll out . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth largest , and I 'm making a good profit . I 'll he happy . " Current changes in the ownership of agencies could be even more significant than the shift to fees . and both push in the same direction . Traditionally , agencies have been owned by the people who work in them  --  as many as 300 of them in the case of B.B.D.O. As young men rise in the business , their seniors give them or sell them shares of stock , which are theirs only so long as they continue to work for the agency . If they leave or die , the stock must be sold back at " book value , " the pro-rata share of the agency 's physical assets . But hook value rises much more slowly than the real worth of an advertising agency , and stockholders eventually rind themselves with a piece of paper that must be sold for far less than its income-generating capacity could bring it in an open market .

First to go was Papert , Koenig , Lois , a small New York agency ; then came Foote , Cone &; Belding ( which has just applied for listing on the New York Stock Exchange ) ; and , last summer , Doyle Dane Bernbach , which sold a one-fourth piece of itself for almost twice its total " book value . " Half a dozen others are expected to move in 1965 . Many ad men are queasy . and some are angry , at the idea of a personal-service operation selling stock to the public . John Crichton , president of the American Association of Advertising Agencies , believes that most of his members do n't like it . " The older peo pie in the business .

The perplexing problem with both public ownership and fee compensation is that they tend to make people play safe in what has always been a gambling business . If the commission system encouraged foolishness by divorcing payment from effort , it also produced a close connection between success and rewards  --  a campaign that really hit could go on for years , with ever-increasing billings and commissions . Most advertising men argue that people will work harder for pots of gold at the end of a rainbow than for limited salary checks at the end of a week . " I tell my clients , " says Norman B. Norman .

" We 're dealing , " says the advertising director of one of Madison Avenue 's biggest clients , " with a very large and very dark room which we 're trying to illuminate with small and costly candles . 31
