In the eight short years since independence began to explode throughout Africa , 30 former European colonial territories have become sovereign - and supposedly democratic-states . <P> But hardly any of them are really democratic . Forced to live as nations although their loyalties and organizations are tribal , torn by all the monstrous problems of backwardness and ignorance , Africa 's new countries have found democracy far too difficult to live with . So far , at least 18 of them have effectively eliminated the opposition and inaugurated one-party rule . Few of the rest seem at all convinced that Western democracy has meaning in Africa . Last week , after eight months of independence , Kenya also set its course for the one-party way . <P> Jovial Host . After playing host to all members of Parliament at his home in Nairobi , Prime Minister Jomo Kenyatta jovially announced that he will ask Parliament for constitutional amendments that will make Kenya a one-party republic . If Parliament refused , he added , he would call a national referendum in November . Since his Kenya African National Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribal groups , there is little chance he would lose the referendum . <P> The announcement only hastened the inevitable . Kenyatta has never favored the present British-inspired constitution , which gives what he considers too much power to Kenya 's seven regional governments-three of which are now in the hands of the opposition Kenya African Democratic Union party ( KADU ) . He has long believed that Kenya needs a strong central government to hold its 50 tribes together . <P> Clamor v. Cry . As far as Kenyatta is concerned , his own KANU supplies about all the opposition he needs , balanced as it is between his own Kikuyus and the Luo tribe of his powerful , Communist-backed Home Minister Oginga Odinga . In a tribal society , Kenyatta argues , the two-party system is unnatural . " We do n't subscribe to the notion of the government and the governed in opposition to one another , one clamoring for duties and the other crying for rights . " Will one-party government mean repression ? For all his terrorist past , Prime Minister Kenyatta , 73 , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights of the minorities-black or white-who opposed him . He says he will not alter any constitutional rights , including individual freedom of expression and assembly . As he outlines it , the new regime will be a sort of a representative dictatorship , with the President chosen from and responsible to Parliament , which in turn would be subject to periodic national elections .
