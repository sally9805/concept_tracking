txt San Juan , Puerto Rico Sixteen years ago , at the inauguration of Luis Munoz Marin as the first elected Governor of Puerto Rico , I wrote from San Juan : " If the peoples of Indonesia or Indochina could see what is happening here , they would not be so vulnerable to the arguments of communism . Or , rather . if the Dutch and French Governments were able to work out the same economic and political relationships that have been achieved here , communism might run into stronger barriers in Southeast Asia and other colonial areas . " The reference to two of the world 's great trouble spots of today was quite unintentionally prophetic . It underscores how much better the United States practices here in Puerto Rico have been than its precepts addressed to some of the old colonial powers . A A A In the intervening 16 years , this island commonwealth has made progress far exceeding the hopes of 1948 . Per capita income has been raised from 5120 in 1940 to more than $830 in 1964 . Still , half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than $2,000 a year . The unemployment rate is over 10 percent . Migration to the mainland is balanced by those who return . Yet despite many remaining problems , the island is incomparably better off than any similar , formerly colonial area you can think of , especially in the tropics . A A A Much of the credit goes to the remarkable leader who stepped down this weekend after 16 years in office . Luis Munoz Marin is one of the great statesmen and politicians who have served under the American flag . Rejecting the independent nationalism in which he believed as a young man , he devised commonwealth status for the island , which in Spanish is translated as " associated free state . " Thus Puerto Rico has the advantages of federal aid and tariff-free entry to the mainland market . But it remains self-governing with its own effective political institutions . The tax inducements and other aids offered by Puerto Rico have attracted thousands of separate plants from the mainland . Yet testing times are ah ( ad . The periods of some of the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industries also need in be attracted . Negotiations now arc under way with the Phillips Petroleum Company which would bring the largest industry yet to settle on the island . However . it requires large imports of foreign petroleum , and that needs permission of Washington . A Thus the island is often reminded of how much its economic well-being depends on decisions on the mainland . It could scat cely he otherwise . for the advantages are so immense . There have been great opportunities for serious disputes and corruption in the interrelationship of business and government .. That these have mostly been avoided is another tribute to the tone of incorrupt ihle leadership and imaginative statecraft set by Governor Munoz Marin . One of the greatest things he has done was to leave office , unlike many similar leaders elsewhere . Ile also provides for an able successor . The new Governor , Roberto Sanchez Vitella , is an engineer - turned - politician . He is a modest man , husky and upright , a graduate of Ohio State University . He will make his own way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A So the formerly colonial world everywhere , and especially in Latin America , can see how a sell-governing democracy may he made to work and its economy to flourish .
