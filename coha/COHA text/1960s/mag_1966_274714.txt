MY TURN by John O'Hara . 214 pages . Random House . $4.95 . <P> Here 's O'Hara again , back only five months after publication of The Lockwood Concern . This time he 's trying to make a little champagne out of pure fizz . My Turn is a collection of O'Hara columns that were featured and syndicated by Newsday , the Long Island newspaper ( TIME , October 8 , 1965 ) . O'Hara 's career did not last very long ; some client newspapers dropped him , and Newsday itself did not renew his contract after 53 weeks . <P> In a tart final column , O'Hara claims that the newspapers canceled because he was too conservative for their tastes . Most readers who like O'Hara enough to plow through the book , which covers everything from politics and education to journalism and television , will concede that he has a legitimate beef . <P> Certainly , as columnists go , old Newsman O'Hara ( New York Herald Tribune , New York Daily Mirror , TIME ) writes as brightly as most and less fatuously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only outside the mainstream of U.S. opinion but outside shouting distance of the river bed as well , it still is a sorry commentary on the press that some editors apparently became disenchanted with him because he supported Goldwater ( " It 's time the Lawrence Welk people had their say " ) , criticized the Kennedys ( " Instant Adamses " ) , and loftily dismissed President Johnson ( " an uninspiring , uninspired man " ) . <P> Actually , if they had kept O'Hara long enough , editors would have discovered that he was impeccably impartial . He was simply a scold in spats . " We are living in the Age of the Jerk , " he wrote in one of his last pieces . " The manifestations of Jerkism are all over the place and limited to no class or race . It is Jerkism when Negro hoodlums loot a shoe store . It is Jerkism when Ivy League types commit vandalism at a debutante party , and Jerkism when Bronx teenagers drop down to the Yankee Stadium outfield and steal Mickey Mantle 's cap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the White House or on the tracks of the Southern Pacific to ' protest ' anything . It is Jerkism to drink three Martinis , and Jerkism to pretend that Pop Art is Art . It is Jerkism for a boy to grow his hair like a girl 's , and . . . Jerkism for a nonrabbinical student to grow a beard . It is Jerkism to be a Communist , and Jerkism to be a John Bircher. "
