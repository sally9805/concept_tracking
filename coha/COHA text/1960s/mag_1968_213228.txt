After every bombing by the B-52s , everyone , from cadre to soldier , became nervous , worried and afraid . This exerted a tremendous influence on the fighting morale . Because they fought the fear of the B-52s in their minds , they weakened after combat and were more tense . Many of them did not want to go far away from the trenches because by remaining in the trenches there was some hope of preserving their lives . <P> - Communist prisoner interrogation report <P> There is probably no more awesome weapon in use in Viet Nam today than the U.S. Air Force 's high-flying B-52 Stratofortress . From the Demilitarized Zone to the Ca Mau Peninsula , the land shows countless scars-spots that look as if a giant rake had swept over them , long parallel lines of deep craters walking across the plains and over the mountains . The scars are the result of tons of explosives rained down in an " Arc Light " mission , a B-52 attack . <P> Since June 1965 , when the giant , eight-engined jets first raided Viet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equivalent to 25% of the total dropped by both the U.S.A.A.F. and the R.A.F. on Europe during World War II ) in more than 26,000 sorties . Most of their bombs are aimed south of the DMZ , where few if any antiaircraft missiles exist to threaten the lumbering , relatively slow-moving attackers . Some 80 of the Strategic Air Command 's older D and E models of the B-52 , originally designed to haul nuclear weapons , have been converted for Viet Nam duty . They normally carry up to 84 conventional " iron " bombs of 500 lbs . each tucked inside their bomb bays and another 24 of 750 lbs . each slung under their swept-back wings . <P> Invisible and Inaudible . The B-52s wheel in from bases in Thailand , on Guam , Okinawa and Taiwan to dump their huge loads . They fly so high that they are virtually invisible , and their bombs detonate on the ground only seconds after the faint whine of their engines is audible-and by then it is too late .

Three hours later , over the Philippines , the green-and-black camouflaged Stratoforts rendezvoused with three KC-135 jet tankers for a 40-minute ballet of mid-air refueling . <P> Day had almost gone by the time we were over Viet Nam . The setting sun bathed the clouds in orange as the pilot , Major John Thigpen , 38 , of Windsor , N.C. , banked his B-52 into the bomb run .
