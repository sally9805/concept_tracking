Tempering the Wind <P> Sir : TIME 'S thoughtful Essay on Red China May 20 should do much to temper the rantings of the bomb-'em-now crowd . It brings hope that China might yet , given another generation , become a world neighbor again . <P> MILTON S. KATZ Sherman Oaks , Calif . <P> Sir : It is unwise to boast that " the U.S. knows more about Red China than does any other nation , with the possible exception of the Soviet Union . " Probably Sinologists in America have collected more facts about the physical aspects of China than have Sinologists elsewhere . But Chinese national psychology is far more important than any other factor in understanding the Chinese and other ethnic groups in Asia .

Evidence of what this city thinks of them : they were given $2,000 by one of the churches to buy medical supplies and equipment , and more than $1,000 worth of Chloromycetin has been shipped to Viet Nam , paid for by popular subscription . <P> CARL G. KING Executive Secretary Saginaw County Medical Society Saginaw , Mich . <P> Sir : You might be interested in our five-year-old Holy Family Hospital in Qui Nhon . It is staffed by eleven Medical Mission Sisters , among them the only American Catholic Sisters working in Viet Nam . Their services include surgery and obstetrics . A venture , started by a Protestant Army chaplain and his unit with the hospital , has been labeled " Operation Harelip .
