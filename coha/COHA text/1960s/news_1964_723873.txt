During the day , the- liquor bills became deeply involvedln a reported deal between tie Governor , and Representative Charles A. Buckley , 1 Bronx Democratic leader . According to the . report , which was denied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed to send an emergency message to the Senate ? needed for the passage of an election bill Mr. Buckley wanted .. - In return , Mr. Buckley was // reported ' prepared to attempt to deliver the Bronx delegation in the Senate and the Assembly in support of the bill to repeal liquor price-fixing . The election bill . defeated in the Senate and then passed when it was moved for reconsideration , provided an intense drama as Senate Majority Leader Walter J. ' Mahoney made an impassioned plea for its approval . The Assembly passed the election bill early today by a vote of 110 to 19 . Nine Democrats were among the 39 who supported the key price-fixing repealer in the Assembly and only two of the 12 Bronx members , Donald J. Sullivan and Burton M. Fine , were among the nine . Governor Rockefeller had put his leadership on the line Wednesday in sending a special . message to the Legislature demanding action on the liquor bills and implying that their defeat would be interpreted as a surrender by the Legislature to the liquor lobby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the massive resentment that the message stirred up among legislators of both parties . Of 17 speakers in the Assembly debate , only two spoke for the bills , Robert J. Feinberg , Republican of Plattsburgh and Speaker Joseph F. Carlino . The ? Speaker rarely takes the floor to participate in debate . He had strongly supported the Governor 's position , but knew when the debate began that he had little chance of being persuasive enough to get the bills through . In a speech nearly 40 minutes long , Mr. Carlini ) said he had never heard the case for sobriety argued with such urgency as had been voiced by the opponents . Message Decried Referring to the Governor 's message , the Speaker said : " I do n't agree with the language or the temper of the message . " Mr. Carlin predicted that failure to adopt the bills would result in the building up of greater pressure for the setting up of a state-owned store system . Mr. Carlin announced after the votes that the Assembly would not take up any of the alternate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alcoholic Beverage Laws . Some of these have been favored in the Senate . Despite the statement by Speaker Carlino that none of the legislative committee 's proposals would be considered in the Assembly , the Senate proceeded to pass two of the alternate bills . One of these would have required wholesalers granting , promotional discounts anywhere in the country to allow similar discounts to New York stores . The second would have eased but not eliminated they ( food requirements for taverns . The vote on both bills was 55 to 11 , with the negative votes cast by Senator George Metcalf , Republican of Auburn . In the discussion , Senator Joseph Zaretzki of Manhattan , the minority leader , called the ' Governor 's message " indecent , infamous and reprehensible . " " If the Governor had kept his nose out of it , " Mr. Zaretzki said , " we would have had a good set of laws . I think it is dictatorial to say , ' here is a bill and you must pass it and na other . ' " The Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendations of the Moreland Act Commission , which was appointed a year ago after scandals were disclosed in the administration of the liquor laws . Two hours after the election bill was defeated in the Senate , it was called up for reconsideration . There appeared to be no switches in votes . Democrats both attacked and defended it . Senator Edward S. Lentol , Democrat of Brooklyn , accused the Governor , among other things , of having created a situation that would get the Democrats fighting among themselves . " He 's finished , " he said . " He 's kaput . He ought to quit . We 've got a good man up there Lieut . Gov . Malcolm Wilson , who was presiding . Let him take over . " Closing the debate , Senator Mahoney made probably the most impassioned and personal plea ? he had made in 28 years , in the Legislature for a switch of votes . End This Canard ' When he was through , Sena-1 tor Lentol jumped to his feet , and demanded a unanimous , voice vote . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with only a few exceptions , . rose spontaneously and applauded for more than a minute . Senators crowded in to shake the hand of Mr. Mahoney , who was in tears . A few other Senators were wiping their eyes . The burden of Mr. Mahoney 's speech had been - that the integrity of the Senate and his own as well had been Impeached as a result of the reported deal . Referring to the election bill , he said : " With the inference that this is tied up with the liquor bills , 1 can just see the headlines tomorrow -- -Mahoney in deal on . liquor bills . ' " Because of the stories permeating this body , the bill was defeated , " he continued . " Both Republicans and Democrats thought they were voting on liquor . " Then he told the Senators how , as leader , he had helped them get roads in their districts and helped get the bills they wanted out of committee , ' Democrats as well as Republicans . " Do this for me , " he pleaded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canard and to stop what I know. will be the ' nfamous headlines tomorrow . " It was not , a question of the merits of the bill , Mr. Mahoney said , but rather a question of the reputation of the Senate . " Give the lie in the only way you can , " he said . " Do n't vote on the merits . Vote for the institution we love . " The bill , referred to as the slate-voting bill , directs that the organization having the largest number of candidates in a primary have the top position on the voting machine . Since insurgents usually do not have a full slate , this is seen as an advantage to the party organization . Its effect is to group the candidates so that the voters will know which , ones are running as a slate . Since Senator Mahoney is likely to be running as an insurgent himself this year , the bill was amended Wednesday to limit its provision to New York City . This required the printing of a new bill and made a message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been on the desk of the legislators for three days . The change would give ' organization candidates an advantage over insurgents in a primary . Mr. Buckley and other Bronx Democrats are being challenged for renomination this year by Reform candidates .. The reported deal came into the open during the Senate debate on , the bill , and the measure , which otherwise would have passed with ease , was defeated 26 to 30 . All four Bronx Democrats voted for it . Effective as Mr. Mahoney 's strategy was , it led to considerable confusion . It left people wondering whether repudiation of the reported deal would not have been more effectively shown by killing the bill outright by sending it back to committee . This led inevitably to speculation - that Mr. Mahoney had bowed to pressure from the Governor to get the bill through for the sake of the Bronx vote for the liquor bills . Credence to the latter interpretation was given by Senator Mahoney 's actions as the bill was about to be called up for reconsideration by its sponsor , Senator Irwin Brownstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the chamber . His jaws were set and he was obviously in an angry state . Normally meticulous in his actions , he lit a cigar and hurled the match across the chamber . Besides the sponsor , only eight Democrats voted for the bill . They . were Samuel L. Greenberg of Brooklyn , Senators ' Manfred Ohrenstein and Jerome ' Wilson of Manhattan , and the four Bronx Senators , Harry Kraf , Ivan Warner , Joseph E. Marine and Abraham Bernstein.
