" The defendant union , powerful though it may be , is nevertheless insufficiently powerful to disdain with impunity the law and the court . Ironic indeed is the fact that this basic lesson in elementary civics must be taught anew to , of all pupils , the very persons to whom we daily entrust our offspring for training and development as the leaders of tomorrow . " So wrote New York Supreme Court Justice Emilio Nunez last week as he ruled against the United Federation of Teachers for ignoring a court injunction and striking New York City 's public schools . U.F.T. President Albert Shanker was given a $250 fine and a 15-day jail sentence . The union itself was fined $150,000 . <P> The ruling marked the first enforcement of the state 's new Taylor Law . Last month it replaced the Condon-Wadlin Act , which had required such harsh punishment that it was rarely enforced .

It holds unions responsible , where Condon-Wadlin used to be aimed against the individual employee . When the U.F.T. ignored Judge Nunez 's injunction , the result was inevitable , at least in Nunez 's mind . <P> The union 's argument , he said , " is specious and sham . " The son of Spanish immigrants who learned his respect for the law while working in the fish markets by day and law school by night , Nunez concluded his lecture to the teachers with a stern stricture : " Law means nothing unless it means the same law for all . This strike against the public was a rebellion against the Government ; if permitted to succeed , it could eventually destroy Government with resultant anarchy and chaos . " <P> Shanker so far has neither paid the fine nor gone to jail ; his lawyer announced that he and his union plan to appeal , thus providing the new law with its first real test .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
