Few national organizations know better than the Communist Party , U.S.A. , how to use-and abuse-the legal protections of U.S. citizenship . Thanks to the maneuvering skill of its leaders and their lawyers , the party has been able to stall off , for more than eleven years , enforcement of the 1950 Subversive Activities Control Act , which requires it to register with the Justice Department as an active agent of a foreign power . But last week the Communist Party finally ran out of time : ignoring a Nov. 20 deadline imposed by the Supreme Court , the party refused to register with the Justice Department . <P> The Communists have a lot to lose by obeying the law . Under the stiff terms of the 1950 Act , the party must list the names and addresses of all officers , members and contributors , label all its propaganda as Communist in origin . Party members can not hold passports , union offices , or jobs with the Government or defense plants . Relying largely on the argument that such penalties amount to an illegal restriction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communist leaders fought the law all the way to the Supreme Court . In June , by a 5-4 decision , the court ordered the party to register , ruled that Congress had the right " to bring foreign-dominated organizations out into the open where the public can evaluate their activities informedly against the revealed background of their character , nature and connections . " At an appeals hearing in October , the court refused to reverse the decision , ruled that the party must sign up by Nov. 20 , officers and national board members by Nov. 30 , individual members by Dec. 20 . <P> By flouting the court decision , the party is now liable to fines of $10,000 a day for each day that it remains unregistered . Communist leaders who ignore this week 's deadline-and they have promised to do just that-could receive sentences of five years ' imprisonment and $10,000 fines . The Justice Department , after years of frustration , fully intends to see that the law 's penalties are imposed . Some time next week , the department plans to round up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grand jury for indictment .
