txt Grave fears about the direction in which Europe 's young but potentially mighty Common Market is headed are now being voiced within the U.S. Government . A secret paper , drafted in the Department of Agriculture and now being circulated " for discussion purposes , " contends that commodity control schemes of the six-nation European Economic Community could go far toward wiping out an export market for U.S. crops which currently approaches $1 billion a year . For a Government document , this one contains some pretty rough language . It charges that the Common Market lands - Germany . France . Italy . Holland . Belgium and Luxembourg-are headed straight for **excessive tand arbitrary ) bureaucratic regulation of markets . " It accuses the Common Market of " aiming at self sufficiency " in agriculture not at freer trade . It states this may well reduce Common Market imports of major commodities from A.nerica and other suppliers to nothing more than " a residual item . " It suggests that if they go ahead with ply:sent plans , the six nations will be violating international obligations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trade G.A.T.To . And that the whole trend will " seriously detract from the possibility of meaningful concessions- in global tariffcutting negotiations scheduled to take place in Geneva this September . Challenge to State Department This explosive appraisal represents a revolt against the dominant position of the Department of State The TT S diplomatic coma assisted at the birth of the Common Market . and has warmly encouraged its first toddling steps . It has even backed this Continental trade bloc against the opposition of Britain . our chief military ally , which has joined Scandinavia , Austria , Switzerland and Portugal in a rival European Free Trade Association E.F.T. A. t . In adopting this benevolent attitude , the State Department has been pursuing not so much an economic theory as a political one . It has viewed the Common Market as a movement toward a United States of Europe , which could strongly confront the Soviet . It has tended to accept the idea that in the long run the U.S. will gain economic advantage from unification of the Continent . And it is certainly too early to predict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overturned by the uprising among Agriculture Department officialdom . Yet there are indications that farm functionaries may gain powerful support elsewhere . Already they have outspoken allies among farm state Congressmen . In the Treasury and Commerce Departments there is real concern over America 's balance of payments deficit . which last year left the U.S. paying foreigners S3.7 billion more than it took in from exports . return on investments and other sources . These agencies are pressing for a forced-draft increase in Yankee exports , and so are bound to share concern over any threat to diminish them . And even within the State Department there is now appearing some real concern over the Common Market threat to US. farm exports . A Flurry of Excitement The publicized Agriculture Department paper , replete with charts to back its argument . was drafted by the Trade Policy Division of the Foreign Agricultural Service . It rolled out of reproduction machines , in neat , blue type , within the past few days . and is generating not only earnest attention but a flurry of excitement . It dwells not on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen to specific U.S. export crops . A breakdown of American shipments to the six countries in the last final year , ended in June , 1959 , of . commodites which seem to be threatened by Common Market protectionism , shows feed grains topping the list , at over $215 million. ? Tobacco ranks second , at $89 million . Wheat and flour top $82 million . Fruits and vegetables approach $51 million . Lesser items analyzed include poultry , eggs , pork , beef , dairy products and refined sugar . What is being attacked is not present practice of the six Common Market nations but their plans for the future . For industrial products , the Common Market has already entered the early phase of a program which is scheduled to eliminate within a few years all trade barriers among member countries and erect a common exterior tariff wall . But or most agricultural commodities the Common Market is still in the planning stage . ' ' Draft proposals " for a waffled agricultural system have been written and are now before the council which governs the organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarmed US. experts . Duties Might lamp 70% One set of calculations just run off for an mportant group of agricultural exports of the U.S. and other nations indicates that European . mport duties might jump as much as 70% aver present levels when the Common Market agricultural schemes achieve full impact . This would be in perhaps a dozen years , for the . ransition from present levels would be gradual . The duty on U.S. tobacco is slated to go ip to 30% of value , against an average of la% now levied by the Mx nations . In conrast. the tariff on tobacco moving within the ' ommon Market and its African associates is scheduled to go down to zero . This can be a manna for French Equatorial Africa , French Nest Africa , the French Cameroon and the Belgian Congo : It can be a blight for Yankee producers . " I certainly think that is a mistake , and It is outrageous , " explodes Kentucky Rep. William Katcher . " I think certainly that it is not the proper type of treatment to expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But the Agriculture Department 's analysis indicates that tariffs will just be a fraction of the trouble looming . Within the Common Market . organizations will be created to set high " target prices " for farm produce grown within member nations and their colonies or associates . Quite apart from tariffs , the Common Market lands are slated to slap on a " variable Import levy " approximately equal to the difference between that high price and the tower world market price for many a commodity . And . just to make sure that no unwanted imports slip in . Import licenses or " license contracts " will be required to bring in many items of farm produce . European Grabs Boreal Planned The Common Market nations would first create a European Crain Bureau . This agency would annually set a target price for wheat grown within the six nations . To support wheat prices at this level , the bureau , among other things , would purchase and store surplus wheat . If any American wheat found a market in this high-price environment , it would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " variable import levy " would skim off the profit . This equalization fee . approximating the difference between the world price and the higher Common Market target price , would be used to finance the internal price support operations of the European Grain Bureau . ' For other commodities , a maze of similar organizations are slated for creation . There is to be a Milk Bureau , a Sugar Bureau and a host of others . While target prices have yet to be set , the philosophy behind them is quite explicit in the Common Market 's draft proposal . A few extracts : " The wide fluctuations of world market prices must be prevented from affecting the agricultural markets of the community . " " Account should be taken of the fact that the conditions of production and the characteristics of the farms in the community differ from those in the extra-European countries . " This refers to the fact that in Rah% for instance . 55 : of the farms are smaller than 25 acres . ) " Prices can not be at the ! lathe level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market , but must be stabilLsed at a higher level . " This sort of talk has U.S. agricultural officialdom up in arms . As their private paper argues , ? " rhe draft proposals would consolidate and perpetuate agricultural protection in the E.E.C . area at levels increasingly unfavorable to trade in farm products . " There is no doubt that the offended Agri. culture Department men would like the State Department to take a strong position in European dickering , to try to dissuade the Common Market from adopting such extreme protectionism . With bitterness . one Agriculture Department official reveals that the diplomats are not yet sold on making a really tough protest to the Common Market planners . Says he : " The State Department always says . ' We expected to lose in the Common Market on agriculture. * Hell we did n't expect to lose . " Admittedly , though , it will be a bit awkward for the State Department if it does decide to rebuke Europe for adopting a high-price and protectionist farm policy . After all , the Europeans can reply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has evolved to magnificent didensions . Curb on Wheat Imports In the case of wheat , for example . the U.S. currently supports domestic prices at Ultra . bushel , some 60 cents above the world price level . This year it will export perhaps 473 million bushels by granting subsidies , but Imports are restricted to a trickle-800.000 bushels . Canada is permitted to ship 795.000 bushels of that , leaving 5,000 bushels for the rest of the world . Backing up this quota system is an import levy of 21 cents a bushel . The same system Is applied to many other farm wares . The Dutch , for instance , who are currently our best Common Market customers , have both a tight quota and a tariff when they try to ship their Edam cheese to the U.S. Though America 's own agricultural pncepropping may cramp the persuasiveness with which arguments can be presented to dissuade Europeans from following a similar course , it enormously increases the motivation for trying to do so . For the upshot of U.S. price-propping , combined with advancing technology applied to lush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exports are deemed an essential safety valve . The tonnage in price-propping storage was so great that storing fees alone cost SIS2 million in the last fiscal year . But it would have been far higher without exports . Last year 53.7 billion worth was shipped out  --  the production of one out of.each eight harvested acres . In the current fiscal year . ending next June , they 're expected to hit 54.5 bd. lion . And of that about $1 billion worth are beaded to the Common Market lands .
