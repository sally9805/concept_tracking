Dwight Eisenhower recently set out from Gettysburg for a California vacation , but he made an important stop on the way . In his private Santa Fe railroad car at the Harrisburg railroad yards , he was host at dinner with Pennsylvania 's Republican Governor William Scranton . They talked seven hours but newsmen did not get any of the details from Scranton until late last week-and then only after they promised to hold the story until after the mourning period for John Kennedy ended this week . <P> In short , Ike had asked Scranton to try for the 1964 presidential nomination . Said Scranton to reporters : " It was not a deep discussion about national politics . But he did point out that he believed-at this stage of the game - two things : one was that a great many people that he had talked with felt that I should be a major contender for the nomination . And he thought so too . And secondly , he knew that I did n't want to do this-I told him so several times . But he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thought to it-and real deep thought-because it was highly likely that at some future date I would have to make a decision as to whether I would run or whether I would not . " <P> Ike 's request notwithstanding , Scranton said he still did not want to enter any state primaries , but he added : " I am remaining flexible . I admit that in the sense that I have said , if there were a real and honest draft , I would have great difficulty in turning it down . " <P> The Governor said that he told Ike he was " flattered that he asked " but that he did not want to run . Yet when a reporter asked Scranton if he was qualified to be President , he seemed angry . " That 's a very dirty question , " he snapped . " Is anybody fully qualified to do every phase of the job ? I do n't suppose so . " Then , more mildly , he said : " It 's extremely variegated , heavily burdensome , but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that I could do the job if I had it ? Yes , I do . "
