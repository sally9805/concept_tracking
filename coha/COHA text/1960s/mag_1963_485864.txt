To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : Sin : In your review of the History of the Moravian Church , ' by Bishop de Schweinitz ( Nation , No. 1066 ) , the comparative silence of our historians about the labors of the Moravians in America is explained by the remark that their " activity was not conspicuous in the political field as was that of the Puritans of New England and the Presbyterians of New Jersey . " This is true and to the purpose , although individuals , like Christian Frederick Post , and , indirectly , the missionaries as a liody , were of much service to the English colonies . But another fact seems to have some bearing on the matter , namely , the silence of contemporary religious writers . Thus , in the Plain and Faithful Narrative ' which Eleazar Wheelock , one of the best friends of the Indians during the colonial period , published in successive numbers , as a kind of bulletin , hetwesn 1763 and 1775 , there is a manifest effort to avoid speaking of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheelock 's pupils , undertook a mission to the Delawares in Ohio . They failed chiefly because the Moravians , with a considerable body of converts from their Eastern missions , were then establishing themselves by invitation in the Delaware territories . - The New Englanders saw both the missionaries and their disciples , and must have known why they were themselves pelitely dismissed . But the ' Narrative ' does not make the most distant allusion to the Brethren , and mentions , without trying to account for , the singular disposition of certain Indians to live like white farmers . The cause of this reticence was undoubtedly the general distrust then felt of Mora vian teaching and methods  --  a distrust which lingered - long after it had become plain that - these foreigners were neither Frenchmen nor Jesuits . It survived , too , the irresistible proofs supplied for years in western Connecticut , - that they were doing the Indians a great deal of good . Both the religious parties in New England , the Old Lights and the New Lights , regarded the Brethren as unsafe spiritual guides ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they commonly said nothing . When McLure published long afterwards a life of his teacher , prejudice had subsided , and he bestowed high praise on the Moravians . After giving this.example of one result of the odium theologicum , 1 may be allowed to emphasize the fact that very excellent work was done among the Indians by both Old Light and New Light - missionaries And it was done in virtue of something which they possessed in common with the Moravians  --  the essential spirit of Christianity , unselfish love to God and man . W. G. ANDREWS . GUILFORD , Coax. , December 7 , 1885 . CONSUMPTION AMONG THE FOREIGN-BORN . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : Stu : In the editorial entitled " Prolonging Human Life , " in your issue of December 3 , Massachusetts statistics are used to show the diminution in the death-rate from consumption from 1857 to the present time  --  a diminution which is very striking , and was dwelt upon by me in a paper read before the American Climatological - Society at its meeting in New York last *spring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall , as I believe , into grave error in asserting that " a portion of this decrease may fairly be as- cribedto the infusion in the population of a large foreign element less subject to consumption than the native . "  --  In 1870 the foreign-born population of Boston formed 35.12 per cent . of the whole inhabitants , whereas , of all the deaths caused by phthisis in the city during ten years , 1864-73 , 51.37 per cent . took place among the foreign-born . Next , 64.65 per cent . of the foreign-born were Irish , but of the foreign decedents by phthisis during ten years , 75.08 per cent . were Irish . This special liability to phthisis of the Irish , who in Boston and the State generally alike are decidedly more numerous than the foreign-born of all other nationalities combined , is fully borne out by other statistics , as can be seen in the following table : Will Perce ntage of all Foreign Irish Percentage Decedents of Foreign Po- from Consump pulation . Hon. 01.35 75.08 18.02 03.03 33.3 4748 - It must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are classed all children born of Irish or other foreign parentage , and the well-known predisposing influence of heredity in phthisis must be kept in mind . It seems to use that these figures , which could under other circumstances be further developed with interest and profit , show beyond doubt that the decrease in the death-rate from phthisis in Massachusetts has taken place in spite of the infusion in the population of a large foreign element more subject to consumption than the native . It is my belief that the decrease is mainly attributable to the prevention of phthisis by improved hygiene , especially-among the- native-born , but that some of it must be credited to more frequent arrest and cure of the actually developed disease through early diagnosis and more rational treatment ? Yours very truly , FRED'If C. SIIA.TTIICK , BOSTON , December 7 , 1885 , I 508 T h e Nat i Number 1 ? 68 To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : But : In your valuable article of December 3 on " Prolonging Human Life , " it is stated that in Massachusetts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decrease in the number of deaths from consumption . This sentence follows : " A portion of this decrease may fairly be ascribed to the infusion in the population of a large foreign element less subject to consumption than the native . " In Massachusetts the chief immigration is from Ireland . , In one seaport town which has an unusually large Irish colony the annual number of deaths from consumption among them is startling in itself , and far greater than among the natives ; their knowledge and practice of the laws of hygiene being naturally limited . This fact decidedly strengthens your main argument. ? Very respectfully , M. G. M. CAMBRIDGE , DUBS. , December 11 , 1885 . SHORT 0 AND SHORT A , To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : I was much interested to see in your examples of phonetic English spelling , taken from Mr. Sweet 's work , the pronunciation of a and O. The short o and short a are completely confounded by the youth of Southern Ohio . Color is pre-flounced ajar , done dane , some same , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some confusion , the penultimate vowels of Tole. ) and Ssx6o being pronounced exactly alike . More than this , the ear seenakunable to distinguish between the spoken sounds of omicron and short alpha , a failing which is continually made apparent in correcting orally Greek prose exercises . I am inclined to think that the ti sound is gradually disappearing in this part of the country , as hot is pronounced like hat , and not the reverse . The usage , however , seems limited to those whose childhood has been passed in this section , and of course there are exceptions among careful speakers . In New England I think omicron is sounded , for the sake of convenience , like o in not , and short a like a in hat ; but it is very difficult , almost impossible , to get the former sound here . I do not know to what extent the pronunciation prevails elsewhere . W. A. M. COLLEGE HILL , Otoo , December 7 , 1885 . MRS . THAYER 'S WILD FLOWERS OF COLORADO . To lab EDITOR OF THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ columns to answer an unwarranted attack made upon a lady , Mrs. Emma Homan Thayer , whose book , The Wild Flowers of Colorado , ' we have the honor to publish . We not only have the word of Mrs. Thayer , which we are perfectly satisfied to accept , but that of eye-witnesses , that the illustrations in her book are , as the title-page announces , " from original water-color sketches drawn from nal ture . " The claim of Miss Alice H. Stewart 's friends that Mrs. Thayer 's studies were made from sketches by Miss Stewart we believe to be as false as the claim of several authoresses known to fame to the authorship of the SaxeHolme Stories . There seems to be a strange mania:among a certain class of persons which takes the form of a claim upon the successful work of others . We beg to append a letter received by us from Kate Ball McClure , of Denver , which bears the same testimony as several others in our possession : " In the Nation of the 29th of October , I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fewest words possible , to correct what must be a very great mistake . I accompanied the authoress of Wild Flowers of Colorado , ' Emma Homan Thayer , on her trips over the mountains , and saw her paint the flowers so faithfully represented in her book . They are not only correctly drawn , but are perfect pictures of the wild flowers of our State . Having painted for years and given the flora of Colorado special study , I feel it only justice to Mrs. Thayer to write this letter . " CASSELL &; COMPANY , Limited . 739 AND 741 BROADWAT , NEw YORK , December 3 , 1885 . ? We have received a similar letter from another companion of Mrs. Thayer on the same excursion , who says : " To my personal knowledge Mrs. Thayer did sketch and paint from nature most of the flowers produced in that book , and such of them as I can not speak of thus positively Miss Stewart does not claim . " ? ED . NATION . CORNELL CONGRESS . To THE EDITOR OF THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you published a letter describing the " Students ' House of Commons " at Johns Hopkins University . A society similar in purpose , but entirely different in organization , was established last year at Cornell University and continues in successful operation . I A complete Senate and House of Representatives were organized . The membership of the former was limited to eighteen , and of the latter to fifty-four . All students are eligible to the House ; Juniors , Seniors , and graduates to the Senate . The House does the work of State Legislatures in electing the Senators . In both branches members are assigned to different States and districts according to politics . To facilitate discussion and keep up party spirit , no one party is allowed to have a majority of all the members . As far as possible , the methods of the national Congress are followed . The Senate and House rules govern practice , and bills are referred to the usual committees and discussed by them . Attendance in the House this year has varied from about thirty-five to forty-five . A senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Congress corresponding to that held in the national Government by the President of the United States , and at the beginning of the " session " wrote an able message , dealing with questions of civil service , tariff reform , currency , Indian policy , etc. , and especially recommending the establishment of a great national university . The object of the mock Congress , as stated at its organization , is " to discuss current and national topics , and to acquire a knowledge of the Constitution and practice in parliamentary law . " As an example of the subjects considered.may be cited bills for the suspension of silver coinage , for the issue of silver certificates , and for the distribution of surplus revenue among the States . Especially interesting has been the debate upon a proposed Constitutional amendment prohibiting the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors . In the discussion the purpose has been not so much to train parliamentarians and possible future Congressmen as to enable the members to understand current politics , and to follow intelligently the course of legislation . The plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hopkins , as it promotes a , knowledge of the machinery of our own Govern. meat , and ' further does not involve the evident inconsistency of debating questions relating to American society and institutions in a body mo- , ? delled after the British House of Commons . , ITHACA , N.

THE " MYSTERY " OF THE ENGLISH ELECTIONS . , - To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : S/H : The elections in England are sufficiently interesting in their bearing on the future of that country , but they have , apart frsom that , a very , special lesson for us . In your last number you refer to them in refutation ofthe theory of the Jefferson Democrats ( though I do not see why they should be credited with a monopoly of it as against the Republicans of recent years ) , that the Civil-Service-Reform Act is wrong because , in the'absence of offices to distribute among the party workers , the interest of the American people in politics will rapidly die out , and it will finally be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taking the trouble to canvass either in public or in private . You then say that in England , notwithstanding only a few of the very highest offices are in question , and notwithstanding the severest laws , most stringently executed , against the use of money , bribery , or undue influence in elections , there never was an electoral conflict carried on with greater heat than the present one . And you conclude : " Now , what is the meaning of the enormous vote which is being polled in England , and the intense excitement which is being displayed under the most discouraging circumstances ? Why do the workers work , and the candidates run , and the orators orate , and the rioters riot , and the voters vote , and the committees hire the halls , and the people crowd them , when there is neither money nor office in the contest ? " The answer to these questions seems to me perfectly simple and clear , and that without invalidating the above theory , which , in the present state of our politics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct . To state definitely the Q. E. D. : the political methods in England are such as to arouse the interest and enthusiasm of the people , while in this country they are not . In the first place , the Liberal and Conservative partig are distinctly divided . No doubt the Conservative of to-day would have been called a Radical fifty years ago , and on different questions the line is drawn with varying degrees of sharpness ; but still it is well understood that the Liberals are for pushing forward and the Conservatives for holding back . This distinction is maintained in Parliament , the party attitude on every question being kept up and intensified by public debate . But the crowning difference is in the identification of principles with persons , The mass of the people have very hazy ideas about free trade , local government , Parliamentary procedure , or even the land question , but they know that Mr. Gladstone and his lieutenants represent certain general views of these questions , and that it will rest with His Ministry to shape the details . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they desire , and his personal qualities come in as a powerful reinforcement . The bitter personal hatred of Mr. Gladstone in London society is nothing more than an expression of fear of the hold which he has upon the nameless millions . The weakness of the Tories is less in their principles than in the fact that they have no champion to match with him . This personal influence may be a good or bad thing , but it is the secret of the excitement of the English elections , and it is the only way , except actual fighting , in which masses of men can be roused to put forth their strength . This is one-man power , it is true , but it is so only be- , cause the people ? believe that he is devoted to their interests . If the fiercest opposition could fasten on him a suspicion that he was pursuing his own interest as against theirs , he would lose his power in a moment .. Only the master of a standing army can maintain a position like that , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no country in the world where the will of the people finds expression as it does in Great Britain to day . In this country the only real dividing.line between the parties as such is the possession of office . There is not a single question of which it can be said to be distinctively Democratic or Republican , and on every one the dividing line among the people would be differently drawn . The House is Democratic and the Senate Republican , but what meaning has the distinction except in its relation to the Executive ? The committees which manage everything are made up of both parties , and settle questions upon motives of which the country knows nothing , but strongly suspects to consist in political trading . What debate there is has absolutely no meaning . The element of personality is totally wanting . There is nobody who in the public mind represents anything . President Cleveland stands , indeed , at ' the moment , for civil-service reform , but not as a principle , and only becade the Constitution gives him the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for it is safe to say that both parties in Congress are against him . It is simply a question of his individual stubbornness . There is something pathetic in the idea of this single and necessarily silent man , fighting like Horatius upon the Tiber bridge , and without a single voice raised in effective support . And civil-service reform is , after all , a mere administrative detail . It was settled in England . once for all , thirty years ago , and no one ever thinks of raising it . But on all political questions  --  tariff , silver , navy , currency , Indians . etc. ? the President and his Cabinet have little more power in determining policy than any average citizen . The country knew perfectly well , in the election last autumn , that it was not promoting a settlement of any of them . The campaign turned upon the moral character of the candidates  --  a thing which in England hardly comes into question at all . It was mortifying , but it was only another illustration how a widely extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with political questions if it can , without them if it can not . If we expect to substitute political enthusiasm for office-seeking as a motive power , we shall have to adopt some method of tying politics to personality . Political leadership is what the country needs , and the solution of that problem is to be found in two words only ? Cabinet responsibility . G. B. Bosrox , December 7 , 1885 . VENICE IN SUMMER . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : Alluding to your interesting paragraph about Venice in summer , in last week 's issue , let me ask you not to leave your readers in the mistaken opinion that they must choose between the canals ( u hose condition may not be as bad as you seem to think ) and the fiat , shelving Adriatic beach . Those who want a swim , as distinguished from a dip , go to the swimming bath which is moored off shore in the harbor , the Canale di San Marco . The spot was formerly between the Mob and San Giorgio Maggiore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; perhaps it will be in the old place next year , ana perhaps over at the southern side , toward the Giudecca . Everywhere there is deep water  --  about eight metres off the Molo , about six off the Dogana , at low water . And the bather waits until the tide has been flowing strongly for at least an hour , and then takes a gondola and goes off to the bath-house , and dives Into pure salt water . It is a pity that no restau rant sufficient for breakfast , at least ; exists at the bath : nothiiig is there but a wretched show of drinkables and cakes and biscuits , ; in fact , it is one of the desiderata at Venice  --  some good eating-place which enjoys the sea breeze and commands a view over the Lagoon . For an Open-air dinner or breakfast one is obliged to go to the Lagoon , though not by steamboat , unless he has to be very saving indeed : why should he go by steamboat , with gondolas ready to take him , to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two francs ? But it is a pleasant place ; and as the guest sits at his little table and waits to be served , he can see the bathers walking out to sea in search of water enough to cover them , and thinks , if he is a swimmer , that he will not imitate them- But let us insistnpon the main point , that Venice in summer is delightful . It is pleasant in May , pleasant in October , and perhaps pleasantest of all in August . And the beauty of sea and sky , the blue light over the Lagoon by day , the loveliness of the night sky , are not to be fully understood until one has resided in Venice in the height of summer . R. S. PHILADELPHIA 'S PROVINCIALISM . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : Silt : Your editorial article of November 26 , on " The Lesson of Philadelphia , " does not appeal to Philadelphians as a satisfactory explanation of a state of things which , every one admits , is very wretched . If you have taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the matter becomes hopelessly obscure . If-it is not protection , what is it ? Your view is confirmed by the fact that Philadelphia has only come under the reproach of provincialism since the State at large has become so violent a champion of protection . I am glad that Mr. Harkness has the freedom of your paper to say plainly what he , with hundreds of business men in this city , feel to be the truth about the Pennsylvania Railroad Company . But there is some doubt whether a railroad company whose first object is to get an outlet and inlet at New York for its Western traffic , will compass the " deliverance of this commonwealth , " or that " the spell will be broken " by its interposition . The Baltimore and Ohio has treated Baltimore even more shockingly than the Pennsylvania Railroad has treated Philadelphia . It is nearly certain that if the Baltimore and Ohio revolutionize the industi nil , intellectual , and social condition of this city , the result will be incidental to the great struggle between the rival companies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not go around Philadelphia . It certainly is not coming here with any avowed regenerative purpose . For the purposes of teaching a free-trade lesson your article was well to the point . Naturally Philadelphians are a bit loath to admit that protection is the root of the evil . Whatever the reason of it all is , I do not understand how any one who looks at the situation with fair-mindedness or judgment can be led to make such statements as does your correspondent " D. G. " ( Nation , No. 1067 ) , about the Quakers and the Dutch . " D. G. " conceives that the Quakers and ? the Dutch are responsible for " Philadelphia 's degeneracy . " Let me quote : " The Quakers founded Philadelphia . For the first 100 years of her existence they controlled her principles and policy . Since then their influence , though gradually diminishing , has always been great . The history of these people is full of acts of heroism and benevolence ; but the essence of their belief is resistance to change of every sort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt , and they never investigate . They are incapable of intellectual inquiry , and they hate it . " The lines I have italicized were either written in the most careless and gross ignorance , or dictated by some petty spite . Some one else may speak for the Dutch , but as a member of the religious - society of Friends ( called Quakers ) , I. am competent to reply that the above assertions are untrue ; that no man who pretends to be fair-minded and at  --  all informed concerning the Friends can support them for a single moment . " D. G. 's " remark that " They ( the Dutch ) are far inferior to the Quakers , have less natural ability , less education , less refinement , " would give to the reader who was entirely ignorant on the subject the impression that the Quakers as a body and the Pennsylvania Dutch farmers might be classed together , though the former had the advantage in ability , education , and refinement . His statement reads as if it were intended to be patroniAng and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are incapable of intellectual inquiry , and they hate it , " and of the Dutch , " High-progress among them is an impossibihty . " The former of these statements is untrue , and it is hard to conceive that " D. G. " did not know that it was false when he wrote it . He goes on to say : " Their descendants of the Dutch and the Quakers are still with us  --  somewhat changed , it is true ; dragged by force of circumstances and the march of modern civilization into a little improvement , but always holding and resisting with all their might . When the mask of the people are of this character , the efforts of the progressive few are in vain . " When a man makes such slanderous statements as these about a , body of people who are everywhere held in such high regard and esteem , as the Quakers , he should make them over his full signature . I am not attempting to defend Philadelphia . I only make this assertion : Take the Friend in this city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent , refined , and public-spirited members of the remainder of the community , and the Friends will loe found to be among the leaders , if not altogether in the van . They constitute a large majority of " the progressive few . " As a body , Friends are celebrated for their high average intelligence and refinement . They certainly take the lead in this respect among those religious bodies which in ' England would be called dissenting , and into which men are forced rather by sincere conviction than by fashion and by conventionality . In ' this city if they do not take the first social position it is only because they renounce it . It is notorious that the people who pride themselves most on their social standing are connected on all sides with the Friends . Least of all can they be justly accused of lack of public spirit . All Philadelphians know of the Pennsylvania Hospital , and are under obligations to the Friends for their part in it . Haverford College is an institution which deserves the highest rank among the smaller colleges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Friends , Bryn Mawr College for women . It is an institution which practises the most advanced educational methods ( those of the Johns Hopkins University , which , by the way , was endowed by a Friend , and is largely managed by members of that society ) , and which has , so far , proved to be a remarkable success . Every Philadelphian knows that the men who have been foremcst in all reform movements set on foot in this city were members of the Society of Friends . The Chairmanship of the Committee of One Hundred since its inception has been held by a Friend . I can think , off-hand , of at least twelve of the most active members of that committee who are Friends . Can it be possible that " D. G. " was ignorant of all this when he wrote his letter to the Nation ? As is very evident , I am not suggesting theories to explain Philadelphia 's sad plight , or bringing 510 The Nation .  - -  -  Number io68 - forward rem edids . My point is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or lack of public spirit on the part of the Quakers . The Dutch only have influence in the State ; the original indictment was against thecity. ? Very truly , T. K.-WORTHINGTON. 11 E. PENN STREET , GERMANTOWN . We have also received letters vehemently opposing some of the sweeping assertions of " D. G. , " in our last issue , concerning the non-production of great men in Pennsylvania . Our space does not permit us to prolong the discussion in this direction , and we think we may fairly adjourn it to the columns Of the Philadelphia press ( where , indeed , " D. G. " is already being flayed alive ) , or to the Pennsylvania Magazine of Anzerlean History. ? En . NATION . POLITICS IN THE PENSION OFFICE . To THE EDITOR OF THE NATION : SIR : Your criticism of General Black in the current number of the Nation for injecting a stump speech into his official report as Commissioner of Pensions , while at the same time you vouch for his alleged facts as unquestionably true , has attracted my attention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill of particulars with which you follow the general statement that " the Pension Office has been used for partisan purposes in the most shameless way , " I think I see the earmarks of the gushing Commissioner , and so presume the items were chiefly gathered from that paper . The particular feature upon which l desire to be heard is referred to in your remark that , " from the Chief of the Bureau down to the Medical Examining Board , almost every place has been filled with Republicans upon system . " This I take to be an echo of the report , because it clearly implies ( although it does not definitely charge ) what the Commissioner proclaimed through the agency of Newspaper Row , when he foreshadowed his intention of reorganizing the medical examining boards , viz. : that they were not only partisan bodies in the sense that they were chiefly composed of Republicans , but that in their professional work the members were swayed by partisan considerations . Before giving my judgment on this wholesale indictment , let me say that that judgment has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ours is the best civil service on earth . On the contrary , I have teen in sympathetic accord with the Nation 's discussions of the subject from the time of the introduction of the Jenckes Reform Bill , and , let me confess it , so thoroughly indoctrinated by them that I have been unable to follow you in now yielding  --  as it seems to The you do  --  the essential principle of the reform by admitting that unexceptionable officers ought to be removed until a political balance of the service is reached . Fully recognizing , then , the extent to which the civil service had tecome debauched by the general acceptance cf the doctrine that the business offices of the Government were the legitimate rewards of party service , I am ready to hazard my reputation for sanity by saying that I believe the official work of the medical service of the Pension Office has been , with rare possible exceptions , as uncolored by partisanship as that of the medical service of the army and navy . The members of medical examining boards know nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the applicants who appear before them ; and if they were governed by no higher considerations , they have ertougb : to do to earn the scanty fee they receive for each examination , without wasting their time on matters wholly foreign ' to their work . The medical service of the Pension Office has suffered , in common with all other branches of the civil service , in the appointment and retention of incompetent men under the patronage theory that has so long obtained ; but the nature of its work , and the conditions under which- it is performed , are not favorable to the development of partisanship in its performance . 1 speak from an experience of over twenty-two years as an examining surgeon , the beginning of my service antedating by several years the establishment of- examining boards , and I have abundant reason for saying that every Commissioner of Pensions , from Barrett ( under whom the office first had a medical service of its own ) down to Dudley , has honestly tried to keep that service clean and to promote its efficiency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created by the fiat of the Commissioner , in order to minimize the evils growing out of the presence in the service of incompetent men which he  --  though nominally the appointing officer  --  was compelled by the power behind the throne , the Congressional office-brokers , to retain upon its rolls . So long as the size of the boards lay within the discretion of the Commissioner , he found it impossible to keep those in the larger cities within wieldy and ef ' ficient proportions , the pressure from Congressmen being , as before , too strong to be resisted . He , therefore , secured the enactment of a law providing for their creation as permanentbodies , and restricting the number of members to three ? an act which has proved of great value to the service . That a large majority of the members of the medical examining boards have been Republicans is doubtless true , but it is unwarrantable to say that these places have been filled with Republicans upon system . The board in this city , of which I was a member from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , has always had a Democratic member , and , what is much more to the purpose ( as bearing upon the charge of systematic packing with Republicans ) , when strong partisan influences were brought to bear upon the Commissioner to secure the removal of a member because he was a Democrat , in order that his place might be given to a Republican , my successful protest against his removal was ( beyond vouching for him as a capable and conscientious officer ) based distinctly upon the ground that the Board had never had and ought not to be invested with any political significance whatever . This occurred during the service of Commissioner Dudley , who has been more strongly accused of partisanship in office than any of his predecessors . 1 know of instances of examining surgeons , Democrats , who were avowed rebels during the war , against whom charges have been preferred by disappointed applicants who fancied that they had not been justly treated by them , and insisted that the fact of their having been rebels was presumptive evidence that they did not feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Pension Office were detailed to investigate these cases , and upon their reports that the surgeons were conscientious men , and professionally the most competent in their neighborhoods , Commissioner Dudley refused to dismiss them . The nature of my relations to the Pension Office has not been such as to give me any information relative to Commissioner Dudley 's operations in the Ohio campaign of 1884 ; but it has been such as to warrant me in speaking with confidence of his attitude toward the medical service of his bureau ; and justice to him and to his pre- . decessors constraint ' me-to say that I believe none them them have ever manifested any disposition to sacrifice its efficiency to partisan considerations . General Black seems to have been the first of the whole line of Commissioners to whom ' it has occurredthat he might possibly make this service an active factor in partisan or personal politics . At all events , he is the first of his line to advertise for volunteers to assist in looting the medical examining boards as a part of the legitimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in his contempt for those who would overlook so tempting a possibility of opening up an entirely new field of partisan activity , he overlooked the indecency of making his official report the vehicle of its expression . He should have confined his " stop thief " cry to his usual channel of communication with the public  --  the bureau of the Washington correspondents. ? Respectfully , JOSEPH ROBBINS . - Qumey , ILL. , December 9 , 1885.
