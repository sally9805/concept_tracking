FAIL-SAFE THE WAR ROOM , OMAHA 41 the time he returned to the desk the map had steadied down and a tiny bright red blip showed between Greenland and the eastern coast of Canada . " Gentlemen , that is an unidentified flying object which has been picked up by our radar , " General Bogan said , his eyes fastened to the Big Board . " Until we identify it positively it will remain a red blip and we will regard it as hostile . " The two visitors stared , mesmerized , at the red blip . It moved slowly across the projection . General Bogan knew precisely what was going through their minds . There was a possibility that they were viewing a real enemy , a plane or a missile , which was flying toward the United States with a hostileintention . " What are you going to do about it ? " Knapp asked . Since he had entered the War Room his voice had never been raised above a whisper . Now the whisper was almost hoarse . " That information , Mr. Knapp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smile . " The Soviets can make a good guess about what we are doing . We always have a certain number of SAC bombers in the air . They have been informed of the Condition Blue and will start to fly toward their Fail-Safe points , " General Bogan said . " Fail-Safe ? " Raskob asked . " The Fail-Safe point is different for each group , " GeneralBogan explained . " They also change from day to day . This is a fixed point in the sky where the planes will orbit until they get a positive order to go in . Without it they must return to the United States . This is called Positive Control . Fail-Safe simply means that if something fails it is still safe . In short , we can not go to war except by a direct order . No bomber can go in on its own discretion . We give that order . " " They must get the order to go ' by radio , " Raskob said . " Is that right ? " " That 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Actually they do not receive the order verbally but it is transmitted to a small box which we call the Fail-Safe box , which is aboard each plane . That box is operated by a code which changes from day to day and can be operated only at the express order of the President of the United States . You have probably read that he is accompanied everywhere by a warrant officer from the Air Force who has the current code that would operate the box . " " Why do n't you just give them a direct verbal yes or no and save yourself all this trouble ? " Raskob asked . General Bogan could tell Raskob was becoming restless . His eyes were fastened on the red blip and its inexorable progress . " Actually we do both . But an enemy could easily come up on the same radio frequency and give whatever message it wanted just by imitating the voice of the President or one of our commanding officers , " General Bogan said . With a smile , he added , " Remember that our President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also , when people talk over the radio there is often a misunderstanding of what is said , especially if there is any radio interference . But there can be no interference with the Fail-Safe box . It can be activated in only one manner and at the express order of the President . " The Congressman turned from the board and spoke sharply to the General . " And what if someone up there  --  or down here  --  cracks ? " " You will probably remember , Congressman Raskob , that last July , the Air Force testified before your committee on our program to give a psychological screening to any airmanwho had anything to do with nuclear weapons , " General Bogan added , trying to keep the irony from his voice . " From generals down to privates . " 42 FAIL-SAFE " Yes , sir , there are a number of people who believe that the Air Force has a high incidence of madmen among its air crews , " Colonel Cascio said with a smile . " A few years back there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ranging from a general down to the pilot of a plane , could start a war . With this procedure we may still have the madmen around but there is nothing they can do to start a war . " Raskob 's eyes were back on the Big Board . Now he licked his lips . When he spoke his voice had something more than the rasp of irritation in it . " Well , what else are you doing ? " he asked brusquely . " Jesus Christ , that could be an ICBM or a Russian bomber and as far as I can tell you are n't doing very much about it . " General Rogan could not resist . " We are doing a good deal right now . Fighter planes are flying toward the unidentified object , ICRMs are going through the initial stage of preparation for launching , whole squadrons of bombers are being fueled and armed in case it really is an enemy vehicle that is coming toward us , " he said . " But , Congressman Raskob , if we went full out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would need four times the appropriations that we now get from Congress . All-out safety is a very expensive thing . " Raskob missed the irony . " What do you mean every time that this happens ' ? " Raskob asked . " How often does this happen ? " " About six times a month , " General Bogan said . " And if we went straight to Condition Red each time it would probably cost around a billion dollars . " Instantly Raskob 's face relaxed , his whole posture became easy . He laughed . " O.K. , General , you win , " Raskob said . " I got that bitTHE WAR ROOM , OMAHA 43about the congressional appropriations . But you should have told me that it happened six times a month . It ca n't be very dangerous if it happens that often . " " Sir , we never take a chance , " Colonel Cascio said . His voice had an odd sharp inflection to it , almost reproving . " Right now we do n't know what that object is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle of some sort . If we can not identify it in a few more minutes or it acts suspiciously we will go to Condition Yellow . If we still are unsatisfied or things occur that complicate the picture we might even go to Condition Green . The last condition , as you know , is ConditionRed . We have never gone to Condition Red , for that would mean that we actually considered ourselves at war and would launch weapons , all of our weapons , at the enemy . What all of this machinery assures is that if we do go to war it is not by accident or because of the act of some madman . This system is infallible . " Colonel Cascio was wrong . Branching off from the War Room is a warren of powerfullybuilt and beautifully orchestrated rooms . Each room has a function . Each is protected by sheaths of reinforced concreteand a layer of lead . Each is air-conditioned . Each is linked to the War Room by alternate methods of communication . The whole thing is as symmetrical , efficient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it . One room in the warren about the War Room is labeled Presidential Command Net . The door is guarded by an Air Force man twenty-four hours a day . Within the room  --  of classified length and classified breadth  --  there are six low , gray , squat machines . Above them is a sign which reads Fail-Safe Activating Mechanisms . Below that sentence and in heavy raised red letters are the words To be used only at express44 FAIL-SAFEPresidential order . There are two desks in the room . One of them is in front of the bank of six machines . The other is behind the bank of machines . Seated behind each of the desks is an enlisted man whose sole duty is to check the mechanical condition of the activationmachine . The machines are deliberately not covered . All of the operating parts must he visible to the two inspectors . The air which is forced into the room is triple-filtered so that it is dustless . At about the moment that Colonel Cascio said the word " infallible " a sergeant sitting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank of machines . " Frank , how you fixed for cigarettes ? " the sergeant asked . " I 'm out . " Frank tossed him a pack of Chesterfields . The sergeant reached to catch them . At that moment in Machine No. 6 a small condenser blew . It was a soundless event . There was a puff of smoke no larger than a walnut that was gone instantly . The sergeant sniffed the air . He turned to Frank . " Frank , do you smell something ? " he asked . " Like something burning ? " " Yeah , that 's me , " Frank said . " You bumming cigarettes all the time and then not paying me back , that burns me . " They grinned at one another . The sergeant returned to his desk . Things returned to normal . . . almost . A small shield hid from the sergeant 's view the tiny knob of burnt carbon on top of the disabled condenser . No instruments on the table indicated a malfunction . Congressman Raskob was a tough man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even enjoying the situation . It had something of the elements of politics in it . " Can you project the fighter planes that are flying towardTHE WAR ROOM , OMAHA 45the unidentified object onto the Big Board ? " Raskob asked . " Certainly , sir , " Colonel Cascio said . He moved some levers . A few feet from the red blip a phosphorescent worm began to glow , became more distinct , and then broke itself into six separate blips , all black . They were diminishing the distance between themselves and the red blip at a rate which was perceptible to the human eye . " Those are Canadian fighters . They are probably subsonic planes so they will close the unidentified object in a half hour or so . " " Colonel Cascio , what information do we have on the UFO ? " Colonel Cascio walked over to the machine and tore off a piece of tape . He handed it to General Bogan . It read , " UFO at Angels 30 , speed 525 , heading 196 . " " That means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour on a compass heading of 196 , " General Bogan said . " Just suppose , General , that the planes get there right on schedule , what are they likely to find ? " Raskob asked . " Usually it is a commercial airliner that has neglected to file a flight plan or has been blown off course by high winds , " General Bogan said . " But keep in mind , sir , that there is a big blank space over the Atlantic where neither the radar sets from Europe nor America have the range to pick up planes . This was n't much of a problem with slow-flying planes at low altitudes , but with jets going at high speeds and altitude they can drift a couple of hundred miles while they are in the gap . ' Occasionally the radar itself makes a mistake and gets a blip off the moon or a swarm of geese or gets a false echo from a satellite . But the radar mistakes have pretty well been eliminatedsince 1960 . " " Suppose it just looks like a commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is trying to sneak through , masquerading as a commercial plane ? " Raskob asked . " It 's possible , but not likely , " General Bogan shrugged . " The fighter pilots would raise the plane on radio and ask where it had started from and what its destination was and this would then he checked out with Federal Aviation Agency operators to make sure it was a legitimate flight . Also the fighter pilots , if they are the least suspicious , get close enough to the plane to give it a good inspection . If there were seams and hinges that indicated a bomb bay on what looked like a DC-t that would change the situation . Plenty . " " What would you do in that case ? " Knapp asked . " I mean that even after the fighters see the plane they still have some suspicions ' ? " " Probably not a great deal , " General Bogan said . " The fighter pilots would order the plane to land or to turn around and if it ignored orders then we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Condition Yellow and would start to launch more fighters and also bring up some of the bombers to a higher degree of readiness . But just a single unidentified plane by itself , still over a thousand miles from any Canadian or American city , does n't constitute a very great danger . Any conceivable enemy would be launching a number of planes at us . What we would do is make sure that the single plane did not have a runaway pilot who wanted to commit hara-kiri on New York or Montreal . " " General , can you add the SAC bombers that are flying toward their Fail-Safe point to the board ? " Raskob asked . " Yes , sir , " General Bogan said . He nodded at Colonel Cascio . Colonel Cascio started to move some levers . " What you will see is a fuller projection of the Northern Hemisphere . It 's something like looking down at the earth from directlyTHE WAR ROOM , OMAHA 47above the North Pole and at an altitude of about one hundred miles . " Again there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmed up , the longitude lines came together at a neat point in the center of the board . The unidentified flying object and the six fighters were now tiny and because the scale was much greater they were closing at what seemed a much slower pace . Six large green blips , fragmented into small dots of luminosity , swam into clear visibility . Even to the unaccustomedeyes of Raskob and Knapp it was clear that these blips were moving at a much higher speed than either the fighters or the unidentified flying object . Each of the green fragmented blips was moving toward a green cross which in each case was well outside the Soviet boundaries , but which formed a rough circle around her borders . " As you can see , the bombers are moving much faster than either the fighters or the UFO , " Colonel Cascio said . " Those are Vindicator Bombers and they fly at over 1500 miles an hour . You also notice that some of them , such as the group based on Okinawa , can get to their Fail-Safe point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The idea is to have all of the planes arrive at the Fail-Safe point at the same moment . The one which has the farthest distance to travel is Group Six , which is the one over the Bering Strait . As you can see , it is moving fast and straight toward the green cross over St. Matthew Island , which is just about at longitude 80 degrees . That is its Fail-Safe point . " " Seven minutes to Fail-Safe , " a loud clear voice suddenly said in words that could be heard throughout the whole War Room . It was a tape-recorded voice that was geared to one of the calculating machines . " That is a recorded voice and it goes on automatically at seven minutes and starts a countdown , " General Bogan said. 48 FAIL-SAFE " It is very unlikely that the planes will actually get to the FailSafepoint . That happens very rarely . Usually the UFO or the radar disturbance is identified well before the bombers get to the Fail-Safe point . When that happens we simply raise the Vindicators on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or to a refueling point . I would say that in only one in twenty Conditions Blue do the planes reach the Fail-Safe point . " " But assume that they reach the Fail-Safe point and the unidentifiedobject is still unidentified , then what ? " Raskob asked . " Just one hell uva lot , " Knapp said unexpectedly . All three of the men looked at him . " Mr. Knapp 's firm manufactures some of the equipment that goes into operation at that point , " General Bogan explained . " The first thing that happens is that automatically we go to Condition Yellow . Even if the situation has not changed materially , the passage of time constitutes a danger . Secondly , a number of supporting light jet bombers equipped with defensive gear and groups of fighter planes would start to fly toward the Fail-Safe point in support of the entire operation . " " Six minutes to Fail-Safe , " the mechanical voice said . One of the doors in the side of the War Room opened and four officers walked in and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing a pretty unusual Condition Blue , " General Bogan said . " Usually we have the situation analyzed and solved well before this . Just as a precaution , once we get to six minutes to Fail-Safe we start to man the various machines in the War Room . " Both General Bogan and Colonel Cascio were looking steadily at the UFO . The two blips seemed almost to have merged . For a few seconds the larger fragmented blip of theTHE WAR ROOM , OMAHA 49fighter plane obscured the blip of the UFO . General Bogan nodded his head at Colonel Cascio . Colonel Cascio walked to a machine and pulled off a piece of tape . He handed it to General Bogan . At this moment the UFO disappeared from the screen . " The unidentified object is now over the Nenieux Islands off Baffin Bay , " General Bogan read . " The UFO is losing altitude rapidly . Our fighters overflew and are now making visual search . No visual contact as yet . The radar signal is erratic . " " Five minutes to Fail-Safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until Fail-Safe , time will be given in half minutes . " " General , what the hell happened to that thing ? " Raskob asked . " It 's gone . " " Colonel Cascio , let 's go to Condition Yellow , " General Bogan said briskly . Raskob and Knapp both swung about and stared at General Bogan . He did not take his eyes from the Big Board . " There is nothing to worry about , gentlemen , this is fairly orthodox , " General Bogan said . " The UFO is not acting in the characteristic way and I have the option to go to Condition Yellow . I have taken that option , because the UFO has dropped from 30,000 feet and disappeared in the grass . Grass ' is the fuzz at the bottom of a radarscope which is caused by interferencefrom hills , some inherent defect in the tubes , and other things we do n't quite understand . But once the plane is in the grass ' it is lost to radar . It may be a plane with mechanical trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an enemy plane taking evasive action . " General Bogan turned and looked at the two visitors . Both of them had a look which he had come to recognize . It was a look compounded of excitement , horror , and malice . It was50 FAIL-SAFE THE WAR ROOM , OMAHA 51not a pleasant look to see , but General Bogan had learned long ago that even for experienced airmen there was a morbid fascination with plane crashes . " Four and one-half minutes to Fail-Safe , " the voice said . On the Big Board the six Vindicator blips were drawing close to the Fail-Safe crosses . II was an elegant maneuver , possessingall of the grace of ballet dancers positioning themselves on a stage . Each group was precisely the same distance from its Fail-Safe point and each was now moving at maximum speed . " Four minutes to Fail-Safe . " One of the desk-consoles started to chatter . A major tore off the tape and handed it to General Bogan . He did not even have to think about the words . " Go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project the light bombers , the Skyscrapper support , and the jet tankers on the Big Board . " " What the hell  --  " Raskob started to say , but stopped in mid-sentence as General Bogan raised his hand . The light over the Big Board went green . There was a sharp , piercing klaxon sound that cut through the room . Doors began to open and in thirty seconds every desk-console in the room was manned . " Three and a half minutes to Fail-Safe , " the voice went on relentlessly . Strange shapes were blossoming all over the Big Board . Behind each of the Vindicator groups appeared a large single blip . These were air-borne tankers . Two fragmented blips appeared on the port and starboard quarter of the Vindicators and began to angle toward them . These were the support fighters which are always activated in a Fail-Safe maneuver but which had not been projected on the Big Board until that moment . Colonel Cascio quickly explained the situation to the two visitors , but without taking his eye from the board . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us why you went to Condition Green ? " Knapp asked , in a whisper . " No , sir , I can not tell you , for the reason which I gave earlier , " General Bogan said without looking at them . His voice was flat and imperative . " Colonel Cascio , will you come with me to the 413-L desk ? " He looked at Raskob and Knapp as he turned , felt an impulse to explain , and then felt a sudden pressure of anxiety . When they reached the desk General Bogan handed the slip of paper to Colonel Cascio . It said , " Extended DEW Line Station No. 4.6 on UFO . Some atmospheric interference , but UFO is not air-breathing vehicle . " " Two and a half minutes to Fail-Safe , " the mechanical voice said . Now the voice was not as loud , for the dozens of machines in the room gave off a low collective hum which toned down its harsh clarity . " Not an air-breather ? " Colonel Cascio asked . There was awe in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk and said , " Try to get DEW Line No. 4.6 and see if they have any dope on the confirmation of the UFO . " The officer repeated the order but even as he spoke his fingers were adjusting dials and levers . A line of three green lights went on . " Two minutes to Fail-Safe . " " If it is not an air-breather , " General Bogan said slowly , " it might be a commercial plane which has lost power on all four engines . It would not give off enough air turbulence for even the DEW system 's new turbulence detectors to be able to pick up . " " One and a half minutes to Fail-Safe. " 52 FAIL-SAFE THE WAR ROOM , OMAHA 53 " If it is a commercial plane that has lost power , we 'll know the answer right away , " Colonel Cascio said . " A pilot can stretch a flight with dead engines only just so far and then he 'll have to crash . If the blip disappears we can assume that it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Bogan stared at Colonel Cascio for a moment . " Not necessarily , " he said evenly . " Get those two visitors out of here . " Colonel Cascio moved toward Krapp and Raskob with an animal-like speed . He spoke to them quickly . Raskob 's voice was raised in protest . At once General Bogan moved toward him . " Now look here , God damn it , General , if we are going to go to war our lives are as involved as yours and I want to know all about it , " Raskob said . " Who said anything about going to war ? " General Bogan asked . Suddenly his voice had a whiplike quality . " Colonel Cascio ordered you out of this room and that was my order he was carrying out . " " One minute to Fail-Safe . " Raskob had spread his feet . He had a pyramidal , fundamental , ferocious look about him . General Bogan realized instantly that here was a man used to fighting . " Do n't try that crap on me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation right now we are one minute from going to war and either I am going to get the hell out of here and back to my family in New York or I am going to stay right here and see what happens . The one thing I am not going to do is let you put me off in a toilet or one of these little cells of yours . Not without a fight . I mean that , General . " " One-half minute to Fail-Safe , " the voice said . " Count down will now be by seconds . Twenty-five , twenty-four , twentythree . . . " General Bogan looked at Raskob and knew that he could not get the man out of the room without a fight . There were other things to do . He turned away and spoke to Colonel Cascio . " It might not be a commercial plane on a crash angle , " he said . " It might be an enemy mocked-up rocket plane which faked a flame-out on all four jet engines and then when it got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our radar and come in low . " A look of pain went across Colonel Cascio 's face . " You are right , General , " Colonel Cascio said . " It is a possibility . " General Bogan realized suddenly that the look of pain was on Cascio 's face because he had ignored a point of logic and not because of the situation . " Fifteen , fourteen , thirteen . . . " The teletype on the 413-L desk started to clatter . The officer in charge of the desk leaned back , away from the tape , so that the other two men could have a clear view of it . The tape came out at the normal speed but to General Bogan it seemed to emerge with deliberate slowness . " UFO has confirmation of Boeing 707 but grass ' obscures total impression , " the tape said . " Operators state that despite interference UFO had normal 707 confirmation . " " Eight , seven , six , five . . . " On the Big Board the six bomber groups were at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked their Fail-Safe points . Each of them was exactly the same distance from its green cross . But the distance was tiny . The blip of the UFO was now invisible although occasionally it glowed and then disappeared . In countless war games General Bogan had seen fighters and even heavy bombers come in so low and fast , jinking , weaving , taking advantage of every copse of54 FAIL-SAFEtrees and every low hill , and managing to evade the mechanical eye of the radar for hundreds of miles . By a deliberate act of will , as deliberately as uncurling a fist into a hand , General Bogan made himself relax . Even so he felt a single drop of sweat , acid from tension , roll slowly down his spine . It did not feel like sweat . It felt like a tiny solid hot piece of shot . He had gotten to the Fail-Safe point before but General Bogan had never had a UFO which acted in such a strange way . As he looked at the Board three things happened . The mechanicalvoice said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bomber blips simultaneously and beautifully merged with their green crosses . The teletype on the 413-L desk began to clatter again . General I3ogan 's head turned about . As it did he saw the faces of Knapp and Raskob . Raskob 's jaw was set . His eyes were unafraid . His shrewd , intelligent face understood perfectlywhat was happening . Knapp seemed mesmerized by the machinery . General Bogan had the impression that he did not realize what was happening . The words came , again at an excruciatingly slow pace , out of the 413-L machine . They said , " UFO is now at 1,050 feet and is clearly air-breathing vehicle . Best estimate is that it is BOAC , Commercial Boeing 707 , which has regained power on two of its jets . " " It 's all right , Colonel Cascio , " General Bogan said . " It did n't make much sense anyway , because if they did come they surely would come with more than a single plane . Let the Vindicators orbit at their Fail-Safe point , however , until we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Cascio stood up and , although his face was smiling , his pink tongue licked at the corner of his mouth . " General , they 'll orbit whatever we do , " he said , " it 's SOP . But I 'm still not sure about that UFO . Could n't the RussiansTHE WAR ROOM , OMAHA 55anticipate exactly the way we would interpret it and just add a couple of jet pods to the mocked-up plane and turn them on when they get within range of 413-L System ? " " It 's possible , " General Bogan said casually . " But not very likely . The whole picture just does n't make sense . " The two men smiled at one another , but suddenly General Bogan had the sense that they were in conflict . Colonel Cascio lowered his eyes . General Bogan turned to his guests . " The UFO is pretty well established as a BOAC commercial airliner which lost power on its engines and then regained them at a low altitude , " General Bogan said to the visitors . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is my best judgmentthat there is no danger . " " I kinda like this whole operation , " Raskob said softly . " I mean it 's a nice orderly thing to meet people who can tie everything up with a ribbon and foolproof . And let me tell you , General , in this world there are damn few things that are foolproof . " The teletype on the 413-L clattered . This time General Bogan waited until the major handed him the tape . He read it to the visitors . It said , " UFO sighted visually and contacted by radio . It is BOAC Flight No. 117 . It was off course due to high tail winds and loss of power on two port engines because of throttle failure which locked the throttles in OFF position . It regained power at 350 feet . " " That 's it , gentlemen . I am sorry that we alarmed you , " General Bogan said . Colonel Cascio bent forward and operated a single lever . Instantly the radio-transmitted order became apparent on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long curve back toward their bases . The jet tankers angled away from their Vindicatorgroup . The defensive bombers made a quick 180  --  turn. 56 FAIL-SAFEThe big light over the Big Board went out . Men began to drift out of the room . The hum of the machines diminished . It was Raskob who first noticed . He stared at the Big Board for a moment and turned to General Bogan with a grin . " Now what the hell is that blip up there at No. 6 doing ? " he said . " It 's gone right by the Fail-Safe point and is moving toward Russia . " General Bogan spun around , his elbow lashed into the taut nervous body of Knapp and he was quite unaware of it . He stared at the board , his body suddenly felt like a terrible torturedmuscle . His mind was white-hot and utterly blank . It perceived only one thing . Group 6 had flown past its FailSafepoint . He spoke out of the side of his mouth , suddenly and comically aware of how much like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the red telephone to the President , " General Bogan said , in a firm low unnatural voice . As he handed General Bogan the red telephone Colonel Cascio picked up the Red Phone Log . He glanced at the clock on the wall and wrote down " 1030 . " At 10:34 Buck left his office . Out of some compulsion to orderliness he had straightened his desk , put on his jacket , and then brushed the jacket with a pig-bristle brush which he kept in one of the drawers of his desk . He thought of going to the men 's room to comb his hair . The moment he stepped outside his door he realized that would be impossible . Standing squarely in front of the door and four feet away from it , was a Marine Corps major . He was breathing hard . " Are you Mr. Buck ? " the major asked . " Yes , " Buck said and then after a pause added , " sir . " " May I please see your identification , sir ? " the major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card . Over the years it had become an empty formality when he passed through the White House gate . He merely lifted his entire wallet toward the Pot who nodded and he walked on in . For a moment Buck felt a sense of embarrassment . It was altogetherpossible that he had left the identification card at home . He flipped through the cards in their cellophane holders. 5758 FAIL-SAFE The major stared straight ahead , ignoring Buck 's discomfort . The major was still breathless and the sound of air sucked in and pushed out of his nostrils was the loudest noise in the corridor . Diners Club card , law-school library card , a picture of his daughter , a picture of the Porsche just after it had been waxed , a gas-company credit card , a membership card in a professional language association , a picture of his parents . He looked in the billfold of the wallet : seven dollars . Buck looked up at the major . There was one more pocket in the wallet . The identification card was there . He almost sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glanced at the identifica- tion picture . Then he moved sideways to study Buck 's profile . Buck 's embarrassment deepened . " Mr. Buck , this card says you have a small scar on your left wrist , " the major said . " May I see that scar , sir ? " " Just a little thing from a high-school football game , " Buck said , pulling his sleeve up . The major stared intently at the scar . He came back to attention and extended the card to Buck . " Follow me , sir , " the major said . He started off down the corridor at a crisp walk . " Yes , " Buck said and then hesitated . If the major called him " sir , " perhaps he was not supposed to call the major " sir . " Buck decided not to . It gave him a sense of satisfaction as he stuffed the card back in the wallet . By now the major was several steps ahead of Buck . Buck trotted until he had overtaken the major and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was several inches shorter than the major , found that he was almost at a slow run . They passed out of the White House Annex into the White House and down several corridors which Buck had never seen before . They swung around a corner and in midstride the DESCENT WITH POMP AND AUTHORITY 59major stopped and came to attention . Walking toward them was a tall lanky man and a woman who was taking notes on a note pad . Immediately to the left of Buck and the major was an elevator . Buck realized two things almost simultaneously : first , the elevator was painted GI green and was operated by an Army officer , secondly , the man walking toward them was the President and the woman was Mrs. Johnson , his secretary . Buck had heard of the woman before . Her nickname was " Johnnie " and she had an aura of her own . She walked with authority and self-assurance . She struck a delicate balance in her attitude toward the President : she was both a nanny and a secretary . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father over forty years before . Since that time she had become a competent and efficient instrument of the family without becoming in the least familiar . When the President first entered politics as a candidate for Congress he had begged Johnnie 's services from his father . Years later , when he entered the White House , Johnnie quite automatically accompanied him . Her hair was now white , her figure heavy , but her manner toward the President was completely unchanged . She was not the least afraid of him nor was she the least familiar . When the President was five strides away the major snapped off a salute . The President nodded at the major , moved toward the elevator with a springy walk , the stride of an athletic person who liked physical motion . " Tell Pete not to even hint to the newspaper people about an emergency , " the President said to the secretary . She scribbled in her notebook . " Also call the Vice-President and tell him exactly what has happened . He will know what to do . Call Senator Fulbright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him drop by the Vice-President 's office . " 60 FAIL-SAFE DESCENT WITH POMP AND AUTHORITY 61The President came to a stop in front of the elevator . He shook hands with the major . He turned to Buck . " Hello , Buck , " the President said . " I remember seeing you in your office a while back . " " A while back " had been several years , but even so Buck was flattered . " Yes , sir , " Buck said . " I am the Russian translator . " Without a verbal order , but more by motion of his body , the President moved all of them into the elevator , including the secretary . Despite its GI color , Buck realized that the elevator was new and efficient . Its one odd feature was in the hack : a large wheel with a plaque above it which said , FOR ELEVATOR OPERATION IN CASE OF POWER FAILURE . TURN TO RIGHT TO LOWER . TURN TO LEFT TO RAISE . The doors of the elevator snapped shut and instantly they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropping like a stone , in a free fall . His knees loosened slightly as the floor dropped beneath him , but he stiffened ; he felt a sad and desolate heaviness in his viscera . He braced against the wall for he had the sensation that he might become sick . He had no notion of how far beneath the White House the bomb shelter was located . To vomit here , in this impeccable G1 elevator with the officer-operator and the President leaning comfortably against the wall and the secretary listening to his words , and the wooden major standing at an apparently easy attention , would be too much . They came to a cushioned stop after a few seconds . Buck 's knees bent a few inches , but so did those of everyone else in the elevator . He felt relieved . The doors snapped open . They stepped out into a large room which held half a dozen desks . On the left there was a luminous screen which covered the entire wall . It was somewhatlike a movie screen , but it had thickness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , wormlike and glowing . Buck had only time to notice six green crosses , five of them standing alone , and one with a queer blob of light a few inches from the cross . Sitting behind the desks were a number of people who were vaguely familiar to Buck . He recognized one , a special assistant to the President , and realized that the others were also special or White House assistants or staff men . All of the men in the room came to a relaxed attention . The President nodded , but did not speak . The heads of all the assistants swung back to the luminous wall . The President turned right and led his little group through a door which was swung open by a captain , his naval aide . " That 's all , Major , " the President said casually . The major did not go into the other office with them . Buck felt respect for abilities he did not possess . First , he realized that all of the assistants were at ease with the President , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speeches made , reputations established , crises survived , toughnessestablished , and the rumors of their outspokenness , he was not surprised by their poise . Secondly , he marveled at the peculiar physical ease of the President . It showed in the way he had indicated that the major should not come farther with them . It was not humiliating , it was not brusque , it was not even very obvious . It was merely a kind of easy shrug which told the major a good deal , but was not offensive . The President led them into a small office . It held a mediumsizeddesk which had a number of telephones on it . There was a chair on each side of the desk . The sound of the air conditioning was like a massive pulse . The President sat down behind the desk . He motioned to Buck to sit in the other chair . The President turned to Mrs. Johnson . " Look , Johnnie . it wo n't work with Pete and the newspaper62 FAIL-SAFE DESCENT WITH POMP AND AUTHORITY 63people , " the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but someone else will crack and start to call Scotty or one of the wire services or some damned thing . " He paused , leaned back in the chair , held a pencil up and studied it carefully . " Tell Pete to let them all know it 's urgent , but not a bonebreaker . Not yet . Off the record . No leaks . Any leaks on this and the guy and his paper are dead . Now and forever . O.K. ? " " I 'll tell Pete , just like that , " Mrs. Johnson said and smiled . " What about the Pentagon group ? " the President said , smiling at Mrs. Johnson , but not responding to her remark . " You 're supposed to have a list or something . " " Yes , Mr. President , it 's right here , " Mrs. Johnson said . She shuffled through the papers she was carrying . She did it with all the expert quickness of a gambler making a fast riffle . A white card appeared in her fingers . The precision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people so poised and prepared he knew he would perform well . " Give it to Mr. Buck , " the President said . Mrs. Johnson handed Buck a stiff white card . He glanced at it . At the top of the card were the words PENTAGON ALERT GROUP . It had been dated at 0800 that morning and Buck realized that the list was probably made up each day . The list contained all the Joint Chiefs of Staff , the Secretaries , and a representative from the National Security Council . Buck noticed that after the name of the Secretary for Air there was a handwritten sentence which said " In Dallas to dedicate new missile site . Back Thursday . " One of the phones on the President 's desk rang and a light went on . " That will be Bogan at Omaha , " the President said . Mrs. Johnson started to turn toward the door . " Wait just a second , Johnnie . " The President picked up the phone . He did not say " hello , " but someone obviously had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at his watch . It was 10:37 . Mrs. Johnson moved toward Buck . For the first time he noticed that her middle-aged and very smooth cheeks were flushed with excitement . She bent over Buck and spoke to him in a low urgent voice . " At least we 're better off than President Truman was in 1950 when the Korean thing started . That 's one of the first things I changed around here , " she said primly . " That poor man could hardly find anyone to advise him . He practically had to make the decision single-handed . He called State , the Pentagon , the Hill , here , there , everywhere . Nobody home . So he did it alone . " Did what , Buck thought to himself . Buck looked up at Mrs. Johnson and smiled thinly . Her memory was said to be limitless , her knowledge encyclopedic , her antagonism fatal . He had heard , and he could not remember where , that when her cheeks showed small patches of pink it was the equivalent of Hitler throwing an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was something more than a drill , that great decisions might have to be made . His throat went dry and then , as he had trained himself to do when he was tense , his smile broadened into a wide and very good imitation of genuine amusement . He saw the President'seyes above the telephone regarding him curiously. 4THE BLUE SKIES , THE BLACK HOLESFive seconds after General Bogan had stopped speaking to the President the phone was back on its cradle and he and Colonel Cascio had started toward a door fifteen yards from the desk . Both were aware that they must not alarm Raskob and Knapp . They moved quickly , but without haste . It was an old drill . This was the first time their walk had intention and , even so , they walked at drill pace . The door was labeled TACTICAL CONTROL . Colonel Cascio opened the door and the two men walked in . The room was served by a sergeant who even as he snapped to attention continued to let his eyes roam over the controls and lights and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room was a long lean console with a bank of switches running down its spine . The room hummed , a faint , rather pleasant hum , like beehives heard at a great distance on a warm day . On a table in front of the console was a desk with a single telephone on it. 6566 FAIL-SAFE THE BLUE SKIES , THE BLACK HOLES 67 " All command posts to Condition Red , Sergeant , " General Bogan said . " All command posts to Condition Red , " the sergeant repeated . With an expert practiced gesture he ran his hand down the row of thirty switches and beneath each of them a light instantly glowed red . Identical green lights above each switch went off . " Verification ? " Colonel Cascio said , looking at the sergeant . General Rogan felt a flash of confidence as Colonel Cascio spoke . His aide knew every drill , procedure , maneuver , and manual of every room which served the War Room , and it pleased the General . Partly , he thought , because it confirmed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and simple ability was reassuring . The sergeant wheeled and looked at the face of another machine . The machine did two things : it verified that the long central console was operating properly and it also confirmed that each of the command posts of SAC throughout the world was actually " cut in " and had received the " Condition Red . " It was merely another precaution to make sure that no mechanicalfailure could occur . " All command posts cut in and tactical control circuits operative , " the sergeant said . General Bogan picked up the phone on the table . When he spoke his voice would be transmitted over a network of transmitterson at least three frequencies to each of the SAC command posts . " This is General Bogan at Omaha , " General Bogan said . " I am ordering a Condition Red , not a go ' ; please confirm . " This was the " Condition Red " system . It was the step betweenalarm and action . It was the bringing of a massivenetwork of men and machines to a condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , be active , but the enormous bulk would merely come to a tense ready . Long ago the SAC researchers had learned that " color alerts " were confusing . For veterans of World War II " Red " was ominous . For others it simply meant a casual stop at a casual traffic signal . Everyone in the widespread system knew that the ultimate alert simply meant a riding of tension , enormous preparation , an intricate series of precautionary steps . The moment that the switches were tripped and the words were spoken , a mechanism went into operation which was such a blending of the delicate and the gross , the individual and the chorus , that it was an orchestration . As General Bogan listened to the individual duty officers confirm both the mechanical and spoken order he remembered something Colonel Cascio had said months ago about ConditionRed . It 's like the start of a 100-yard dash , the colonel had said . Except that you keep coming through " on your marks " and " gets sets " and you hang there with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go . . . and the pistol never cracks , no one ever says " go . " General Bogan never thought of it that way . But then Colonel Cascio had been a sprint star in college , had run the hundred in 9.6 . Even now there was a rumor among the enlisted men that he could run the hundred in under 10 seconds . General Bogan had never asked but the colonel looked it ; he had a jaguar-lean look about him . He kept in perfect physical shape , but never made a point of it . He never talked of his workouts at the gym , never lectured anyone on obesity or physical fitness . He merely kept himself taut . When General Bogan finished receipt of the acknowledgments , the Condition Red order was completed . It was initiated by a man , checked by a machine , counterchecked by a man , 68 FAIL-SAFE THE BLUE SKIES , THE BLACK HOLES 69who was counter-counterchecked by another machine , and all men and machines were carefully watched by other counterpartmen and machines . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , restrained itself , passed information to itself , carefully filtered incoming information , automatically tripped other systems that were serving it . At Barksdale Air Force Base , Louisiana , the officer in charge of the Second Air Force put down the telephone after he had confirmed General Bogan 's order . He pushed a machine which electronically checked to make sure that General Bogan 's verbal order had also been fed into the responsible machine at Omaha . He then pressed a button close to the telephone . At once a scream went up from a score of klaxon horns scatteredaround the base . A gigantic barracks building transformeditself . An entire wall rolled away . Inside were ten station wagons , each with its exhaust plugged into a special hole in the floor , and each turning over slowly . An enlisted man sat behind each wheel . In the area behind the station wagons there were a snack bar , card tables , television sets , sofas and chairs . The space was occupied by approximately fifty men . The mood thirty seconds ago had been tranquil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOQ , and a ready room . The moment that the door swung open and the klaxons started to wail , each of the men ran for the predesignated station wagon . With a beautiful practiced precision , the station wagons tore across the vast expanse of the field . Each station wagon 's journey ended beside a Vindicator bomber and the crews piled out . The supersonic bombers were already prepared by special warm-up crews . They not only warmed up the engines but they kept a constant running check on every part of the intricate bomber . The warm-up crews turned over their planes to men who were perfect strangers , keeping their eyes on the instruments until the last moment , then grinning at the strangersand relinquishing command , swinging out of the plane and into the waiting station wagons . Two and a half minutes after the alert had sounded the first of the bombers wheeled to the head of the runway and started to whine down the long black asphalt track . Five minutes later all of the " ready " planes were in the air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speeded up . As the first wave of bombers took off another series of bombers were being warmed up and another series of crews had occupied the barracks . The station wagons were back idling . The barracks doors had slid shut . Neither the people who had gone through them a few moments ago nor the the present occupants knew whether they were at war or repeating a familiar drill . The men appeared to be casual . This was also their inner reality . Anxiety had long ago been burned out . At some bases the metabolic rate was increased so slightly by the Condition Red that it was hardly perceptible . The crews of jet tankers , for example , walked to their huge aircraft knowing there were only two alternatives : if enemy missiles were already in flight not one of the crewmen would reach his plane , but all would be crisped black somewhere along their leisurely walk . Their tankers were unprotected and in the open . The other alternative was that they were participating in a drill . The crewmen had long ago given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lesson : there was nothing they could do to alter anything in any situation . Some parts of the system were nothing more than great offices . They were part of the " logistic pipeline . " Their men and their machines performed a clerkly function , but a necessaryone . They made sure that everyone in the operation had adequate supplies of everything : chewing gum , one million tons of jet fuel , tiny needles in plastic containers which had70 FAIL-SAFE THE BLUE SKIES , THE BLACK HOLES 71a smear of poison on the tip that could kill a man in three seconds , fresh tomatoes , black boxes in infinite variety , tubes , screws , bolts , typewriters , rubber tires , little gray cubes that , soaked in water , expanded into beef steaks , aspirin , morphine syrettes , paper and carbon paper in every size known to man , " canned " jet engines , ready to ship jet engines fresh and tuned , beans both canned and dried , life jackets , codebooks , cigarettes , leather jackets , brandy flasks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pills , death jackets in wood or silk . You name it , we got it , a sleepy and very proud master sergeant said as he looked over his rows of filing cabinets and calculating machines . Around the world a hundred other men like him did the same . . . in confidence , with pride , and without question . Thousands of sleek fighter planes were being readied but only a few of them were launched . They were loaded behind revetments and in ready rooms and at the ends of runways , poised like polished needles , their wings drooping . Their time would come later . In all of this vast system there was not a single man who knew for certain what had started the operation . Not a single man knew whether this was a genuine " go alert " or another of the hundreds of practices they had endured . The men were calm . The whole intricate mechanism functioned flawlessly . The second system that General Bogan had activated was the Gold System . This was different from the gold telephone which connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was the global system of missiles . These were the strange new vehicles which were launched by men , but had no living creature aboard them . Once launched , some were guided by men . But others used stars and planets to position themselves , constantly making small alterations in direction while moving at a speed of 20,000 miles an hour . They could not be launched by the men who readied them but only by the man at the very top of the pyramid . Once launched they could not be recalled . And the fact of the launching could not be concealed from the enemy . The missiles ranged in size from the big bulky stub-nosed strategic missiles weighing hundreds of tons down to the light-weight jeweled devices for tactical operations . The work of readying the giant missiles was complex and time-consuming . Missiles like the Atlas and the Titan began to give off weird clouds as liquid oxygen filled their tanks . The Minute Man and the Polaris , which used solid fuel , began the elaborate countdown which had been done hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colorado there was no visible sign from the air or from the ground that a huge missile operation occupied seventy square miles of Colorado prairie . This was a " hard site " base . Everything was deeply submerged below ground . Only a direct hit could incapacitate one of the three Titan missiles operated from each of the six shockmountedcomplexes comprising the Lowry Missile Wing . Even if one of the complexes were put out of commission the other five would remain operational , for no one of the complexes was closer than eighteen miles to another . Inside each submergedmissile complex life was completely self-contained , sealed off from the rest of the world . The missile-site base was the enemy 's prime target . The crews of the bases , depending on their literacy and background , expressed it differently : bull's-eye , homer , 4.0 , knockout , prime , top priority , ten-strike , No. 1 , apres vous le deluge , horse 's ass , the first good-bye . They all meant the same thing . They all knew that the enemy , any enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the seaports , the ships , the planes , those could come  --  or go  --  later. 72 FAIL-SAFE When one descended into the deeply buried command post and personnel quarters there was the sensation of entering an ingenious collective coffin . Each time might be the last . But no one really believed in either extreme  --  that it might be the last time , or that it was just another practice . They were emotional neuters . Long ago , under the scrutiny of hard-eyed psychologists , the claustrophobic and the easily-panicked men had been weeded out . The rest had been made deliberately nerveless . They were technicians of a greater terror taught to ignore the unalterable end of their work . And , in honest fact , most of them did not believe in their work . It was a gigantic child 's play , a marvelous art . It had to be done perfectly each time and it was . But it came to nothing . Hundreds of times they had run through their procedure , checked off the thou- sands of items , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of facts . . . and then stopped just short of climax . As the Titan started up its massive elevator , and passed between its open 200-ton concrete doors , as its umbilical cord began to fall away in the clouds of chill swirling LOX , each man worked as if war were about to start . But each time , each of the hundreds of previous times , the order had come to stand down . The Titan had been carefully lowered back to its base . Although an intercontinental ballistic missile requires only twenty minutes to reach a target in Eurasia , hours are required to get a missile ready for its short white-hot trajectory . Scores of men working with a network of computers , calculating , checking , double-checking , all moved at top speed but with great deliberation . The total operation was coordinated by the firemaster . Each missile also had its Fail-Safe point , but it was a point in the process of checking rather than a point in space . It was a clerical , a calm , a well-ordered Fail-Safe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 73only proceed to a certain time . Past a precise and well-known " Positive Control " point in the countdown each missile passed into the " terminal sequence . " The sequence could only be started at the order of the President of the United States . The cavernous life , the manufactured secrecy , the incredible pitch of training , made a missile base into a strange experience . The crews lived a buried existence . The end of a tour of duty was like the end of a sentence . As the crewmen were relieved they came out into the air , blinking at the brightness , never certain that they were returning to a normal world of shopping centers and baby-tending and love-making . They had been taught that it was altogether possible that they would emerge into a black incinerated world in which their chief duties would be to avoid deep contamination and then to wage a savage fight for existence . The details of this fight were deliberately kept ambiguous . To prepare a corps of men for defeat is almost certain to destroy their capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mood should be ferocious , but the object of the ferocity was not specified . The men who expended their lives raising and lowering these gigantic masses of intricate and explosive material were not without intelligence or heart . They were aware of the eerie , nightmarish quality of their existence . They thought of their strange condition and they discussed it . It was a surrealisticdialogue . It was conducted by technicians with no more than an eighth-grade education and by officers with a Ph.D . The environment gave them an awesome quality . These subterraneans moved nervelessly through their artificial world , developed new outlooks and insights and oddly twisted views of themselves and of reality , evoked a new humor which was both loving and profoundly cynical , grinned a new way , were74 FAIL-SAFEnostalgic for things like fresh air and grass , had fantasies which no man had known before because no man had lived as they lived . Out of their subterranean places they reverted to the life aboveground without effort or strain . They seemed as normal , as uniform , as ordinary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were a separate breed . In a form which would surprise a student of the classics they told the ancient myth of Sisyphus in which Sisyphus was condemned to roll a boulder laboriously up a hill only to have it tumble hack again ready for another push upward . The myth trickled down from the officers to the men in strange and vulgar forms but no one mistook its import . It was always told , regardless of the language , with a strange sense of wonder and relevance . The more speculative of the missilemen , the eggheads among then ) , had also discovered an unofficial poet laureate : Albert Cam us . Camus , who had understood fully the futility and the antic and the senselessness of much of modern life , had also , in a perverse way , found the principle and will which allowed him to live through the awful stresses of the French undergroundduring World War II . Like Camus , the missilemen had learned to live seriously in a world which was absurd . To enter a missile compound on Gold Alert was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service of ununderstood mechanical totems . Quietly and systematically , without any public announcement and without any realization on the part of the public , the nation rose to a full and ominous alert . There was also another element in the subterranean life which was pervasive , perfectly known , understood , and never discussed . There was the knowledge that the enemy was doing precisely what they were doing . Somewhere halfway aroundTHE BLUE SKIES , THE BLACK HOLES 75the world there was another set of silos , another pattern of hard sites , another organization of men  --  almost , they assumed , precisely like theirs . This is no easy knowledge to carry . It is one thing to arm the thermonuclear warhead on an immense missile . It is another to know that another person , with almost the same training , is doing the identical thing  --  and that he must be thinking of you  --  and knowing that you are thinking of him thinking of you , and on and on . It was no life for ordinary men . One must have vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and independent judgment . One must be outwardly friendly and inwardly cool , for life in the silos is intimate and forced and to open too much is fatal and to stay too much closed is fatal . The subterranean men were proud men , sure of their ability . They also had developed to an almost sublime degree the capacity to forget the sum total of their task and to concentrate on their small role . They were a hard-working , magnificently trained team . They were even an enthusiastic team . But they carefully avoided any discussion of the end result of their teamwork. 5THE FLAYED BULLBrig . Gen. Warren A. Black came starkly awake : his eyes wide open , his toes spread and digging into the sheet beneath him , his fingers forming into fists , his stomach flat and tight . His skin was covered with a sweat that was really a slime of fear . He knew that in a few more minutes his wrist-watch alarm would go off . Aware of a thin scratchiness behind his eyeballs , he wanted to go back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sleep was where the Dream happened . Until six months ago Black could not remember dreaming . Now his sleep was almost always broken by some variation of the Dream . It brought him awake , arched and sweating . At first he was torn between the desire to sink back in restful blackness and the fear that he might , instead , fall into the Dream . Recently he always stayed awake . He knew there was one way that he could end the Dream : by resigning his commission . He said it to himself in a score of ways ; sometimes mockingly , sometimes cruelly , sometimes7778 FAIL-SAFE THE FLAYED BULL 79in an antic mood . But the Dream did not vanish . It was also invulnerable to logical analysis . He knew , in a fleeting but dreadfully sure sense , that he could never exorcise the Dream . He could end it only by resigning . But the thought of resigning from the Air Force was torture . The Dream always opened on a bullfight arena . Although Black had never been to a bullfight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some bullfight books . The Dream was accurate , replete with detail of picadors on padded horses , banderillas , bad music , and the background of huge ads for beer and automobilesand a milling crowd . Perhaps , Black thought , he supplied the detail from some long - forgotten book . That hull was real enough , charging out of the gate , pawing and snorting . Its charge came to a grinding halt , its immense body reared back on its hind legs , as frozen as statuary . It came down on all fours , swung its horns around the arena , and looked , with puzzlement , for the adversary . The bull gave off a deep fundamental bellow . It was the sound of confidence . And from the people in the arena came back a deep fundamentalsilence . The bull 's roar ended on a tiny shattered sound of agony . A stripe of red appeared on the deep black hide of its shoulder . The bull wheeled , spun on its hooves with magnificent speed and grace  --  and again gave off the thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , appeared on its flank . Quickly then the bull charged and charged again and then a third time ... endlessly , with no seeming diminution of power . But it was confused . Each time it wheeled to a stop there was another white or red stripe on its hide . There is a matador in the arena , Black said to himself . But I can not see him . He must be hidden by some refraction of sun on the glittering sand , some unintended camouflage of costume , perhaps by the strange assault of the colors of thearena . Black turned his head , tried vainly to see the matador , but he was never successful . Looking around the arena . Black realized with a pleasant feeling that everyone in the stands was familiar . They were his associates , the people he saw in his everyday work  --  privates , civilian secretaries , generals , colonels , technicians , majors , scientists , professors . But he could not identify any one of them exactly . He could not attach names to faces . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reassuring . The invisible matador worked the bull closer and closer to where Black was sitting . He could hear the wind from its huge lungs , see the little puffs of sand kicked up by its hooves , see the massive neck muscle swing the horns . The bull came very close . Then Black understood the white and red stripes . The bull was being flayed naked . The invisible matador was not using a regular sword . He was using some sort of instrument which neatly shaved off long narrow slices of the bull 's hide . The white stripes were cartilage and fat ; the red were made by blood which ran down the great suffering body and dripped into the sand . Now , directly in front of Black , the bull showed fatigue and confusion . The matador sliced and soundlessly another stripe fell away from the living flesh beneath . There were only a few spots on the bull 's body where the hide remained . His head hung low and his nostrils blew two tiny volcanoes of dust , no bigger than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bull , with sadness , slowly , closed its lids . Black looked around the arena . The familiar faces were enjoying the scene . Their open mouths roared approval  --  but no sound came out . They smiled , pointed their fingers at the spectacle , bellowed soundlessly , beat one another on the back , 80 FAIL-SAFEdanced with excitement . Tears of pleasure rolled down their faces . Black 's mood of reassurance vanished . Then the terrible thing happened . The bull lifted its head , its agonized eyes fastened on Black . For a moment they stared at one another . And then , in some unknowing way , a pact was made . The bull 's eyes showed relief . Black felt himself becoming the bull . It was done effortlessly . It was as if his body oozed like a fog into the shape of the bull . The familiar Black dissolved , lost form and substance , slid into the body of the immense animal . Now he was looking up at the audience , he was bewildered by the strange colors and sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He felt a great confusion . He also felt two kinds of dread . The two things he dreaded had always brought him abruptly awake . First , he knew that in another moment the pain of the flaying would come crashing down his nerve fiber and into his hull-brain . Secondly , he would turn and see , with his bulleyes , the matador . Both things were so frightening that he awoke instantly . Black tossed in his bed , looked at his watch , and saw that he had another few minutes . Idly he wondered at what point in a dream a person began to sweat . His pajamas were wet around the neck and waist and under the arms . He felt as if he had been sweating for hours . And yet , he sensed , it was probably only for a few seconds . He forced himself to relax . Be logical , he said to himself . He sensed again that the Dream and SAC were linked . If he could resign his commission the Dream would go . But he loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it meant as much to him , almost , as his family . And its mission was so important . But a shadow lurked in his mind , a tiny burr ofTHE FLAYED BULL 81unrest . It vanished when held up for examination , yet an elusive doubt remained . Something was very wrong . He felt a moment of despair . Would he continue to awaken like this , to crash from a black terror into total wakefulness ? He did not like the sudden awakenings , though as an airman , some twenty-five years before , he had gotten used to them . In those days , other sounds had brought him awake abruptly , almost like shock , with an instant heightening of the metabolic rate , a gushing of adrenalin . The whine of sirens , a rough hand shaking his shoulder on a cold English morning during World War II , the thin growing frenzy of the sound of a bomb in flight . . . then , oh yes , then he had come awake instantly . But it was a different kind of wakefulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He made a decision and sat up in bed . The Dream was forgotten . He must start the long business of getting through the day . He forced himself to smile . No sweat . Getting across midtown New York this early would be a cinch . With luck he 'd be able to check out a Cessna " Blue Canoe " and run down to Andrews by himself . In any case his time was O.K. The shuttle plane could get him to the Pentagon for the ten o'clock briefing . One way or another he 'd make it . No sweat . He looked over at the sleeping figure beside him . Betty had not stirred . She needed the sleep and he wanted to shave , dress , and clear out without awakening her . He eased out of bed and fumbled in a dresser drawer for clean linen . Black was a tall man . He had a roughly hewn , square , rugged handsomeness about him . Even his head conveyed the impression of angularity and squareness , as if it had been built up out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examples of " How to Draw " books . He was like an unfinished piece of sculpture , sharp edges not yet rounded off . It was82 FAIL-SAFE THE FLAYED BULL 83not simply massiveness he conveyed , it was also a sense that he would not soften with age , his flesh would not turn to fat . He had been designed by a good draftsman , rather than by a fine artist . His head was thickly covered with deep-brown wavy hair which he kept closely trimmed . Once in prep school he had let it grow and it had turned into a tight cap of curls . A slim and fay instructor had smiled at him across the room and said , " Our forest satyr . " Black had never let his hair grow long again . His eyes were revealing and as if for protection were deep-set . They were brown eyes which fixed steadily on people . Even when he had to give a harsh reply his eyes did not waver . His perceptive subordinates could anticipate Black 's mood from the narrowing of his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the boys ' bedroom on his way to the bathroom . He had the old pilot 's habit : a secret , almost sub- conscious , trace of permanent leave-taking with each good- bye . The boys were too big now to accept a public kiss from their father , though he would have gladly bestowed it . But early in the morning he could steal in alone and softly kiss their foreheads . John , the twelve-year-old , was tightly balled and had orbited halfway down toward the foot of the bed , his head hidden under the covers . Black straightened him out gently , rearrang- ing and retucking the blankets around his shoulders and neck . David , the fourteen-year-old , was spread-eagled across his bed , half uncovered and one foot out over the edge . Black recom- posed the second bed and body . The two boys were opposites in this as in so many other things . He had spent his life , it seemed , re-covering David and unsuffocating John . As he shaved , quickly and expertly with a safety razor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend away from the boys . Somehow , because Betty was seven years younger than he , Black felt a kind of paternalistic distance between himself and the three of them . He grinned into the mirror . That melted pretty damned fast when he was alone with Betty on what she laughingly referred to as her " responsive nights . " He had been born into the immensely wealthy Black family of San Francisco . They had been wealthy since the Forty-niner days when a young and anonymous man named Ned Black had made a strike on the small fork of the Yuba and had returned to San Francisco with a burro carrying close to 3,000 ounces of gold dust and nuggets . No one knew where he was born or if he had a family . The Blacks of San Francisco began with Ned Black . He had bought great sandy tracts of San Francisco and had sold them for huge profits . Black had seen Ned Black 's library . It was made up of books by John Locke , Fourier , Robert Owens , the great Chartists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn and used . Ned Black had gone off to the Civil War and came back with an empty sleeve . He was a quiet man before he left and quieter when he returned . He lectured his children on only one thing : man was social , he had a primary obligation to his society . The Blacks , like all rich San Franciscans , gave to the Opera and the Symphony and museums , but most of their money went into schools , hospitals , and libraries . And not a single building they gave to the city bore the name of Black . Ned 's sons , grandsons , and great-grandsons all followed his quiet , intense , and private way of life . They became ministers , businessmen , educators , and a few of them , to old Ned Black 's great gratification , became politicians . Ned Black thought it the most noble of professions , the most necessary of social tasks . Whenever there was a reform movement , a commission to investigate crime , an effort to broaden education , a Black played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to follow the tradition. 84 FAIL-SAFE THE FLAYED BULL 85He had no flair for politics and little interest in business . Even when he had graduated from one of the best of the Ivy League schools he felt rootless and somehow guilty . In World War II he had joined the Army Air Force and it was there first , and later in SAC , that he found his calling . He flew and fought with unspectacular success and although he loathed the destruction of life he brought himself to agree that it was necessary . He was steady , competent , and with absolutely no desire for publicity . Over the years he had developed a love for the Air Force , although he knew that it should be impossible to love such a great impersonal organization . He had met Betty when the Air Force sent him back to his Ivy League college after World War II to study international politics and foreign policy with the famous Professor Tolliver . Betty had forced herself into one of Tolliver 's seminars and commuted from Radcliffe once a week to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Betty 's father was a famous professor of naval history and Tolliver had finally yielded . He pointed out bluntly that she was the first girl he had ever had in his foreign-policy seminar , that the talk often got " salty , " that she would not be given grace because she was a female  --  female was the word he used , not " girl . " Betty nodded . When she appeared at the seminar it was more like someone coming to do battle than to discuss abstract ideas . Her face was scrubbed and without make-up . She wore severe little gray suits and she seldom smiled . She spoke with a strong even voice that was overcontrolled . It was only midway through the semester , when her anger emerged , that her face took on a striking and handsome look . It surprised Black , for he suddenly realized that she was both an attractive and a very emotional person . Betty had been tensed against Tolliver from the start . She saw him as an intellectual enemy . To see Tolliver as an enemy was easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antagonismwas another thing . Tolliver was formidable . Tolliver was a senior professor in the field of international relations . He came from old New England stock and his dedicationto scholarship was savage , total , and complete . If his ideas led him out of the classroom and the library and into public battle he did not hesitate a moment . His first public battle , when he was very young , had been a catastrophe . Before World War I he had been a pacifist . He had spoken and lectured and written against involvement with the European power blocs , he had attacked war as inhuman and obsolete , he had led " peace parades " in New York City and Washington . He had studied ancient war , medieval war , nineteenth-century war , twentieth-century war . Quite unknowinglyhe became one of the foremost experts on warfare in order to attack it . At some point  --  it was never identified by anyone precisely and Tolliver never spoke of it  --  Tolliver changed . It was one of the most famous intellectual conversions of his time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their cause for a position on the other side so extreme that it startled even the interventionists : war was an ingrained part of any society . His argument was not crude , it was stated in the language of the scholar , it was replete with footnote references to history and to the psychology of aggression , allusions to Freud and the death-wish . Tolliver did not argue that war was good or desirable , merely that it would always exist as long as man organized himself into societies . For several years in the thirties Tolliver had been intensely unpopular . He was labeled pro-English , a subversive , a turncoat . His classes dwindled in size . Liberal and radical magazinesattacked him ferociously . But when America entered the war , almost overnight Tolliver became something of a prophet , 86 FAIL-SAFE THE FLAYED BULL 87a culture hero , an intellectual " with his feet on the ground . " Tolliver ignored the praise just as he had ignored the criticism . He survived even the public reason which he gave for not volunteering for military duty . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory of war and peace . I 'm one of those best equipped to do that . That I shall do . " He had been doing it ever since . He was entirely a person of the mind . His age was indeterminateand no one had dared ask him . He could have been a burned-out fifty or a well-preserved seventy . His white hair was thin and seldom brushed . He had several suits ; no one knew how many , for they were all the same conservative cut , the same excellent English cloth , the same hue . They all looked ruined in a few months for they were never pressed or cleaned and they were decorated with pin-point holes where live ashes from the endless cigarettes he smoked had burned themselves out . When he stood up a small cloud of ashes fell away from him . In a relaxed mood his face appeared weakly muscled . But it was an illusion and he was seldom relaxed anyway . Usually he seemed to be burning with fury . It showed most in his eyes  --  bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hunter 's excitement . In argument his face went hard-muscled ; his nose seemed more beaked . At the slightest criticism of his ideas , even the suggestion of indifference , Tolliver attacked . He moved forward in his chair , his body tense . He looked somehow like a logic-chopping rat , teeth slashing into flimsy arguments , gnawing at more solid evidence with a terrible persistence . He rarely left an argument with the decision in doubt . His knowledge of war and society was so vast , his dedicationso single-minded , that it seemed unlikely while listening to him that anyone could know more than he or develop a viewpoint which he had not anticipated and worked into his master view . Tolliver paid no attention to university politics , his colleagues , campus social occasions , or other trivia . His students received his intense and narrowly focused attention , for he saw them as the carriers of ideas . Personally he knew only their names ; intellectually he knew them completely . It was impossible to flatter the man ; his eyes merely went icy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the students in the seminar had tensed , leaned forward in their chairs and waited for the blood to flow . It did not happen quite that way . Betty had introduced some anthropological evidence that a certain Melanesian tribe waged peace rather than war . They competed at giving one another gifts , at doing small favors , at multiplying courtesies . It was clear that the example was new to Tolliver , but he attacked at once . The data were insufficientfor general conclusions , he said . Let the tribes be attacked once and they would respond with conventional warlikereactions . But they had been attacked and had not so responded , Betty said . She read from the study . When she finished Tolliver came back with a ripping analysis . Betty countered with further evidence . Black broke in with a neutral question and Betty glanced at him with contempt . He was in uniform and she had assumed that he would automatically support Tolliver 's views on the inevitability of war . The argument had ended in a draw . Tolliver had muttered that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From Tolliver this was close to a glowing tribute . Black congratulated Betty as they filed out of the seminar room . She cut him short . It was plain that she did not like men in uniform . There had been other things besides his uniform she had not liked . When she learned that he was from the San Francisco clan of Blacks , she invested him automatically with all respon-88 FAIL-SAFE THE FLAYED BULL 89sibility for the misdeeds of the Huntingtons , the Hopkinses , and old Grandfather Black . She knew Black was wealthy and she thought that the Air Force was Black 's hobby . Once she told him , " To paraphrase Will James , you seem to have made war the moral equivalent of being a playboy . " It was during that semester that the man who was now President had started in politics , running for Congress in a nearby state . Needing all the campaign help he could get , he naturally called on his old classmates . Black was one . Betty supported him in that initial campaign , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Black revealed that he commuted on weekends to help in the same campaign Betty was startled . In an ornery and hilarious way , which Black later came to love , she then attacked him for being linked with the Eastern " great wealthy . " To Betty , Black seemed a perfect example of a dangerous breed : the power elite from the industrial , financial , military , and political world . It was Tolliver 's seminar which gradually dissolved Betty 's notions about Black . One particular afternoon Tolliver had let himself go a little further toward preemptive war than usual . A young Ph.D . candidate named Groteschele , who had just recently transferred to political science from mathematics , had been present . He argued that the war against fascism was not over : the military struggle against black fascism must now be converted into the military struggle against red fascism . It was the first time Black had ever heard Walter Groteschele speak , and as he listened he had no notion that it would be the first of scores of times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political scientists that developedafter World War II , a group which later included such as Henry Kissinger , Herman Kahn , Herbert Simon , and Karl Deutsch . But for a few years in the beginning , Groteschelestood alone , without peer , just as he had planned it . Now Black was only aware of a faint rasp of irritation at what Groteschele said . There was nothing on which he could put his finger , nothing he could use his intellect against  --  only a dim kind of restlessness , a sense that there was some obscure danger in what Groteschele said . The professional liberals in the seminar shifted in their seats but did not speak . Tolliver turned to Black . But instead of giving the expected reply Black outlined what he thought were the military reasonsRussia , though dangerous , was a manageable threat to America . Black spoke calmly and with authority and his eyes never wavered when Tolliver began to tense into his rigid posture of attack . When the attack came Black handled it calmly , constantlyreferring to expert opinions , studies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her face . She found it difficult to side with Black the militarist but when finally she did it was with a fierce eloquence . The seminar did not end with the neat trimmed summation that Tolliver liked . It ended in a sense of tension , an odd unbalance . The students walked out gingerly . Black moved toward Betty as the seminar ended . She got up quickly , folded her papers , snapped them into her brief case , walked out without glancing at Tolliver . Her face was flushed and attractive . Black thought : she has all the charm of a bawd unmasked at a Sunday-school picnic . " How about continuing this over a beer ? " he said in a low voice , leaning down just behind her ear . She turned so quickly her nose brushed against his cheek before he could withdraw . A blush spread over her face and deepened as she realized it . He knew for sure then what had remained true ever since. 90 FAIL-SAFE THE FLAYED BULL 91Betty was the most attractive , the most interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was on the verge of kissing her on the spot , and she knew it . In a way , they both decided their future in having that beer . The rest was just making all the moves and countermoves required to carry out the decision . There had been some difficultyabout the " Black unearned fortune , " but Betty had been reassured when Black told her that he lived entirely on his colonel 's pay and that his share of the family income went into a fund at Wells Fargo Bank . Black said he had no notion of what the fund amounted to , but that it was " maybe around four million , " and they both burst into laughter . Once , a month later , they 'd taken a picnic lunch to Walden Pond . " But why the Air Force ? " she asked . " I can understand going in at the start of the war , but I ca n't understand why you 'd stay in afterward . " " It was simple , " Black said . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not because of family background ? The Air Force work was mine . The commendations came in from majors and colonels who could n't have cared less about the San Francisco Blacks even if they had known of them . " He looked at her directly and for the first time she sensed his bluntness and honesty . " You heard I was one of those ' Blacks and put me into a category . " Betty nodded her head in a silent agreement that was also an apology . " You 're my favorite militarist , " she said softly . " Do n't use labels , Betty , " he commanded . " Do you think the SAC people are all anxious to have war ? Do n't be a fool . We 're as scared as everyone else . Look , I was on the Strategic Bombing Survey of Germany after the war . It 's not something that 's liable to make you a warmonger . " Black paused . The survey had been a pause in his life too . It had troubled him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Survey was that , for all the apparent devastation , the main thing destroyed was people . The factories and the railwayswere put back into fairly good running order in an unbelievablyshort time . Indeed , bombing seemed to be an odd prod to survival , to sharpen the impulse to strike back . " Blacky . " She took his hand and he looked down at her , startled . She put back her head and laughed loud enough to startle some birds into flight across the pond . " You look as if you thought you were about to be raped . " He could not believe his ears . He was delighted and confused and definitely embarrassed . " Am I ? " " Are you what ? " " Am I about to be raped ? " She choked with laughter and somehow they had their arms about each other , quite clumsily . She said into his shirt , " I 'm such an ass . " On this note  --  more or less  --  they were married three months later . Black 's early morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not slowed down by traffic . He arrived with plenty of time to spare for the flight to Washington . The day was clear and mild , and he checked out a Cessna 310 . He had never lost his affection for a small , light plane . Even the 310 was automated , but it was still fun to fly . Someday he wanted to buy one of the quick stubby stunt biplanes that were now being reproduced , and recapture the old thrill of flying , to fly rather than to administer a plane . As he settled on course for Washington , he felt the need suddenly of a cold drink of water , and last night 's cocktail party came flooding back through his mind . He had not wanted92 FAIL-SAFEto go at all . Betty had never taken to Groteschele . Black also knew he would be listening to Groteschele at today 's briefing . So when Senator Hartmann 's secretary called he 'd tried to beg off . But Hartmann was insistent . He had collared Emmett Foster , the editor of the Liberal Magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What 1-lartmann wanted was a cocktail party confrontationbetween Foster and Groteschele . Each in his way was distinguished . They merely happened to be at opposite ends of the controversy over thermonuclear warfare . Hartmann was no fool . A Midwestern Republican with a vigorous shock of white hair , sanguine complexion , and Falstaffian girth , he orated like William Jennings Bryan and generally looked like a musical-comedy senator . But under that shock of white hair operated one of the finest minds in Washington . As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee he wanted to hear the two points of view in an informal environment . He knew that Black was considered a " brainy " general and was a link between the purely tactical people in SAC and the Big Planners at the Pentagon . Groteschele had , of course , become famous after the publication of Counter-Escalation , which Foster had dissected and left for dead in the pages of his magazine . Usually Betty refused to go to **28;3707;TOOLONG cocktail parties . To Black 's surprise she insisted on going to this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Groteschele , as usual , was even later . Foster stood in a corner talking in a firm , even voice . Black realized that the man would be no pushover . To Black most " professional liberals " had shrill voices , spoke in a rush , and accused anyone who questionedTHE FLAYED BULL 93their facts of favoring nuclear extermination . Facts were unimportant . Survival , common morality , humanity , damage to unborn generations  --  this was their chant . Not Emmett Foster . He was a cool one and Black could tell it instantly . Even as they moved across the room , Foster , a short muscular man with hard black eyes , used words and phrases which indicated he had read the Congressional Record and the scientific journals and probably interviewed a number of military people . Also Foster did n't skip around . He answered questions precisely , sticking relentlessly to the point and relyingon real evidence . Betty and Black listened for fifteen minutesand Betty turned to Black , her eyebrows arched . " No fool , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Groteschele arrived . He had not changed much physically since graduate-school days . A bit heavier , but not grossly so . But he was dressed better and he had the air of authority about him . He is almost silken , Black thought . He smiled easily , said something to everyone he was introduced to , patted Black on the shoulder , kissed Betty on the cheek . He smelled slightly of men 's cologne . Hartmann introduced him to Foster , but Groteschele smiled and said they had already met . Without a wasted motion Groteschele moved beside Foster , stationed himself for the debate , but with no sign of antagonism or of condescension . Foster waited until the introductions were over and went on . " Times have changed since Clausewitz . True , war was an institution like church or the family or private property . But institutions grow obsolete , exhaust their function , " Foster argued . " Real tough-mindedness consists in recognizing that thermonuclear war is not the extension of policy by other means , it is the end of everything  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 95 " Groteschele , " Foster said in his firm unyielding manner , " is a modern Don Quixote , dashing through the stratosphere on nuclear jaunts , talking of obliteration as if it could be made partial , hypnotized by his own words . " Foster stopped almost politely , and looked at Groteschele . Groteschele rocked on his heels , looked down at his scotch and water . He let the silence draw out . He shook his head once , a slight puzzled motion as if he were considering one argument and had abandoned it . Betty , who seldom drank , took a long scotch from one of the passing waiters . Black noticed that her hand trembled slightly . Finally Groteschele spoke . His voice was extremely gentle . " In a full-scale nuclear war between America and Russia a hundred million people , more or less , will be killed  --  right ? " he asked Foster . " A hundred million , " Foster repeated , " or more . " The circle of people about the speakers moved restlessly . Betty finished her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black moved closer to her . " Things would be shaken up , " Groteschele went on . " Our culture and their culture would not be the same . Granted ? " " Granted , " Foster said . He grinned toughly . " Now this is a tragedy and no one here denies that , " Groteschelesaid and his eyes swept generously over the group , lingered on Senator Hartmann . " But would you not grant that the culture which is the best armed , has the best bomb shelters , the best retaliatory capacity , the strongest defense , would have an ancient and classical advantage ? " " Which is ? " Foster asked . " It would be the victor in that it would be less damaged than its enemy , " Groteschele said . " Every war , including thermonuclear war , must have a victor and a vanquished . Areyou suggesting , Foster , that we should be the vanquished ? Do you value American culture less than the Soviet culture ? " Betty 's hand had tightened on Black 's arm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now so deep it was almost ferocious . " Simply marvelous . So neat , so logical , so well-ordered . " He paused and looked at Groteschele . Groteschele did not nod for he knew this was the opening of an attack . He smiled at Foster and for the first time it was a smile of condescension . " Groteschele , it should persuade a monkey , a high-school kid , maybe an Air Force general , maybe a Senator , but not many others , " Foster said savagely . " It indicates only that you are a prisoner . " " Of what ? " Groteschele said . " Of the past , of stale ideas , of cliches , " Foster said . He paused and looked around the group . " What is called for , " he said , " is a complete and revolutionary break-through in our thinking . We are like men enclosed in a paper sack of old ideas and assumptions . The sack surrounding us appears to be complete and seamless , when in reality all we have to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom of entirely new thoughts and approaches . What the times call for is a new Karl Marx " A new Marx , Foster , " Groteschele broke in , " an arresting thought . What would the new manifesto proclaim ? " " It would proclaim peace , " Foster said without hesitation . " Not because peace is nice or I like my fellow humans or it is Christian or Gandhi hated violence or the sick-sick-sick kind of liberal chants it . Peace because it is the only way we can Live . Get with it , Groteschele . Probability and the cobalt bomb made you old-fashioned ten years ago . Be realistic . " Foster 's magazine had a circulation of only thirty thousand . The affluent and influential people he spoke before now were96 FAIL-SAFE THE FLAYED BULL 97  --  one would think  --  more the Henry Luce type . Yet they were visibly impressed . " Moving , very moving , " Groteschele said . " But somewhat dangling , a bit suspended , no indication of how we get from war to peace . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war just happens to be a reality . I want us to face realities . " " All right , Groteschele , look at it from the viewpoint of the anthropolgist , " Foster said . " What is war 's function ? " " The resolution of conflict , " Groteschele snapped . " In primitive societies how do men resolve their conflicts ? " Foster asked . " By individual combat , " Groteschele said . He had pulled his shoulders back and was somewhat more tense . This type of dialogue where his opponent turned Socrates made him restless . " And when they became organized into tribes ? " Foster said . " Then the fighting becomes collective , " Groteschele said . " And when they become nation-states ? " " It is still violence , damn it , Foster , " Groteschele said . " What is irresponsible is to suggest that as groups become bigger and the power of weapons more immense that anything is changed . " Foster cut in rudely . " Are you suggesting that a spear thrown and a nuclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nonsense ! Is it not possible , Groteschele , that war itself has become obsolete ? Your superbly reasoned Counter-Escalation indicates that in any possible war the overwhelmingmajority of citizens are going to be killed . Does this suggest to you still that war is a resolution of conflicts ? " " Foster , you are hopelessly sentimental , " Groteschele said . " The situation is no different than it was a thousand years ago . There were primitive wars in which populations were totally destroyed . The point is , who is going to be the victor andwho the victim ? It is still a question of the survival of a culture . " Foster rocked on his heels . " A culture , " he said slowly , his voice full of wonder . " A culture with most of its people dead , the rotting smell of death in the air for years , its vegetation burned off , the germ plasm of survivors contaminated . You say I am the utopian and you are the realist . Do you really think that this world you describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gambit . His reply was reasonable , quietly uttered , and difficult to refute . He drew it out to great length . The spectators listened respectfully . It was Betty who broke the spell . Before Black realized it , she had moved from his side , drunk , yet at the same time rigidly controlled . " It is hopeless , " she said , staring at the two men . " You are both romantics caught up in your fantasy world of logic and reason and that is why it is so damned hopeless . Because man himself has become obsolete . He is like the dodo and the dinosaur but for the opposite reason . His damned brain has gotten us into this mess because of its sophistication and we can not get out of it because of his pride . Man has calculated himself into so specialized a braininess that he has gone beyond reality . And he can not tap the truth of his viscera because that , for a specialist , is the ultimate sin . " Black had not heard her speak with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pall on the group . Even Groteschele was at a loss for the right thing to say . He went through a ritual of taking a Philippine cigar from a small leather cigar case in his pocket . Since the Bay of Pigs episode he had stopped smoking Cuban cigars . " You think I 've overdone it ? " As Betty spoke a new quality seemed to come over her . Black looked at her with increasing98 FAIL-SAFE THE FLAYED BULL 99concern . An inner intensity was flowing from her , almost visibly . It acted like a powerful magnet on everyone present , drawing their eyes to her , holding their rapt attention . " The world , " Betty continued , her voice now edged with despair , " is no longer man 's theater . Man has been made into a helpless spectator . The two evil forces he has created  --  science and the state  --  have combined into one monstrous body . We 're at the mercy of our monster and the Russians are at the mercy of theirs . They toy with us as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gods of Greek tragedy , they have a tragic flaw . They know only how to destroy , not how to save . That 's what we 're now watching in our cold war : a Greek tragedy in modern form with our godlikemonsters playing out the last act of their cataclysmic tragedy . " She stopped and looked at Black quickly , as if seeking help . But before he could speak or move toward her she was speakingagain . " We all know that the big explosion is going to happen . Your concern , the two of you , is to make sure that you die intellectually correct . But my problem is more primitive . I only want to make sure that when it comes and my boys are dying that I am there to ease their last pain with morphine . " She finished in a flat voice entirely without self-pity . Her last statement seemed to give Groteschele a new assurance , a place to get back into the conversation and guide it into safe channels . His words came on gently and kindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us who know anything about the situation feel almost exactly the same things that you have expressed . But what should we do ? All go out and buy morphine ? You see , Betty , I 'm trying to save your two boys , not narcotize their death . That 's the whole point of everything I 've written . In spite of all our efforts , thermonuclear war maycome . We must face that possibility rather than , ostrichlike , close our minds to it . And I 'm trying to see that if war comes , men , our kind of men , have the maximum possible chance of surviving it . " Betty looked composed now but her fingers were digging into Black 's arm . " General Black , what do you think ? " asked Senator Hartmann . Black looked up slowly from Betty . He fixed his eyes on Foster and thought for a minute . " I think that Betty is mostly correct , " he said slowly . " Once one knows where he wants to go he can summon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have the awful feeling that we are reconciled , both we and the Soviets , to mutual destruction . We are now rallying our different logics to support our identical conclusions . We will probably both get the results that we want . In that case , morphine is more important than a bomb shelter . " He stopped and for a moment he felt an excitement . It was wild and irrational : he understood the Dream . He was in a game in which the things that held him together were being stripped away . Then , quite suddenly , he could go no further . Betty 's comments had just about done it for the party . Everyone drank and chatted politely for a few minutes . Then there was the intricate ballet of social disengagement . Black knew that their host would not forget his heretical position . The Senator was a methodical man . In the taxicab back to their apartment neither Black nor Betty had spoken . She had fallen asleep on his shoulder , her teeth grinding . General Black snapped back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force base outside of Washing-100 FAIL-SAFEton . Looking down on the water-veined flats of the Chesapeake Bay area , he regretted that the air approach to Andrews did n't take him over Washington proper . He never ceased to be stirred by the splendor of the Washington Monument 's slim white spire , the awesome majesty of the Lincoln Monument . The Pentagon , though , that was something else again . Its low , squat improbable shape was not designed to capture an air- man 's fancy . It was more like a great , bureaucratic land battle- ship pulled up alongside the Potomac . That 's about what it was , mused Black , laying siege to the helpless flotilla of weaker bureaucratic ships across the Potomac . Back to work , Blackie , boy-general , he said to himself . Life is earnest , life is real . He brought the plane in for a skilled and effortless landing . Ten minutes later he was in a staff car and on his way to the Pentagon . The President looked across the desk at Buck . Buck knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were slightly squinting . Buck twisted in his chair . The motion caught the President 's eye . His face suddenly hardened and he seemed to come back into the room . " What do you think of that list , Buck ? " he asked , pointing at the card that Buck still held . Buck hesitated , lifted the card as if it were very delicate , glanced again at the names . He felt like licking his lips , but resisted . His mind reached for an answer , something that would make sense . It was impossible . " I only know them as names , " he said quietly . " A few I have never even heard of . " He saw approval in the President 's face . Then the President was not seeing him any more , but was abstracted . " Relax , Buck , " he President said . " We 're in an emergency , but we 've got time , a little anyway . Time and a decision . That 's what an emergency is . Now the decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us with . The time we ca n't control . It just passes . " tot102 FAIL-SAFE BOMB SHELTER , THE WHITE HOUSE 103It sounded silly , but Buck knew that the President was not thinking what he was saying . His voice and his mind were operating on different levels . Then they came together and the President was seeing Buck again . " Buck , that group sees one another all the time , day after day , " the President said . " They 've probably talked over things so much that they 've got a nice committee solution for everything . Right ? " " Yes , I imagine they have , " Buck said . " The only problem is that this is something they have no solution for , " the President said . " Bogan told me that in Omaha they had no standard operating procedure for this kind of thing . So we 've got a novel situation , something completely new. , , The President swung in his chair and looked at his secretary . Quite automatically her pencil lifted , moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is n't he ? " the President asked . Buck 's eyes ran down the list . " There is a General Black , Mr. President , " he said .

He can think on his feet , deal with a novel situation . Trouble is that either they 'll make a committee solution or they 'll all listen to someone like Blackie . He does n't talk much , except when he believes in something . . . . " His voice dropped and he stared at the wall , not seeing it . Then he swung back to them , entirely in focus , speaking briskly . " Next we need someone who 's not a Pentagonperson , but who knows his way around . Whom do you suggest ? " He asked the question of both Buck and Mrs. Johnson . Buck stiffened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could , quite literally , not recall the name of a single person . His mother ? Gypsy Rose Lee ? Old Mr. Carmichael in the apartmentbelow ? He must be losing his mind . Mrs. Johnson looked at the President , then flicked over a few pages in her notebook . " They 've got that Professor Groteschele out there for the briefing , " she said . " He 's not one of them . I mean he does n't work at the Pentagon . " The President rocked in his chair . " He does n't work for the Pentagon . That 's right , " he said slowly . " But that book of his almost made him one of them . " He paused . " O.K. , Johnnie , he 'll add something to a bunch of people that have been seeing one another too often . Tell the Pentagon to include Groteschele in the advisory group . Tell Swenson that Groteschele is personally cleared by me and that he can say anything he wants on any subject . " " As long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightly . The President grinned . " Swenson has a pretty well-developedsense of the relevant , " he said . " I know that , Mr. President , " Mrs. Johnson said . " I know that you know that , Mrs. Johnson , " the President said and made a mock bow . She smiled , turned , and left the room . Buck sat silently with the President of the United States . He knew they were waiting but he did not know what for . THE ORGANIZED MANWalter Groteschele awoke at precisely 5:30 A.M. He did not awake at the sound of an alarm clock and , indeed , he did not even wear a wrist watch . Despite this he was certain of the time . He was awake fully . As he swung out of bed his mind began to block out the day . It was a quick , neat process , somethingthat occupied him only from his bed to the bathroom . By 6:10 he would be showered , shaved , dressed , nourished by one cup of instant coffee , and waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An hour to Washington ( and his second cup of coffee , at 10,000 feet ) - 9:30 . At the Pentagon by ten minutes to ten . The check list was complete . The day was under control . Groteschele stepped on the bathroom scales-185 . He had weighed 165 when he was twenty-one . He knew some men who refused to weigh themselves , were afraid to get the bad news . Groteschele weighed himself every day of his life . As he stepped off the scales he even forced himself to think what the additionalfat meant . Face reality , he told himself with a quiet105106 FAIL-SAFE THE ORGANIZED MAN 107pride . Facing reality was what had gotten him where he was . As he showered , rubbing his body with a rough natural sponge , he ran over the physical differences between twentyoneand forty-eight . Then he had been lean and muscular . Now there was an overlay of fat about the torso . Not gross , but noticeable in a suit . Softer . Around the waist the flesh was a bulge . Where it showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were usually tight and bit into the flesh , making his face slightly pink . As he shaved he calculated whether or not it would he possible to exercise the fat off . The calculation did not take long . He did not have time for exercise . Only once during his five-stage ( car , train , taxi , plane , taxi ) trip from Scarsdale to Washington did Groteschele 's mind relax and think of anything except the briefing he would present . It was in the taxicab from Grand Central to La Guardia . There was something about the luxury of a taxicab , to ride alone while others rode in buses , that made Groteschele think of his youth . Briefly he permitted himself the luxury of letting his mind wander . Groteschele 's father was a tough , brillant , and hard-working physician , a highly skilled surgeon . He was also a Jew , unfortunatelyin Germany . Early in the 1930s he had seen what was coming . He had argued with other Jews in his native Hamburg that there were only two alternatives : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of his friends and relatives , anchored by their possessions and inured to the prospect of suffering , stayed in Germany . Many of them died in gas ovens . Walter Groteschele was fifteen when his father abandonedhis medical practice and moved from Hamburg , via London and New York , to Cincinnati . Before his father could practice medicine in America it was required that he take two years of residency and pass a series of examinations . Hewas never able to get enough money ahead to do the two years ' residency . Emil Groteschele worked first as a ditchdigger for a utilities company . He could not , however , stand the calluses and the coarsening of his surgeon 's hands . Eventually he wound up as a butcher in a kosher butcher shop . This was an irony , for Emil Groteschele was a Reform Jew and anything but devout . But the work did allow him to use his hands in somewhat the fashion for which they had been exquisitely trained . Emil Groteschele was not an embittered man . He had understoodclearly what his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life and the lives of his family . Nothing more . One of the few times that his son had seen him angry was when the subject of the Diary of Anne Frank came up . Emil Groteschele had offended the Jews of Cincinnati by arguing that Anne Frank and her family had acted like imbeciles . Rather than hiding in an attic and clutching their Jewishness to them they should have made plans to escape . Failing that , they should have been prepared to fight the Nazis when the final day came . " The steps leading up to that miserable attic should have been red with Nazi blood  --  and that of the Frank family , " Dr. Groteschele argued bitterly . " If each Jew in Germany had been prepared to take one SS trooper with him before he was sent to the camps and the gas ovens , precious few Jews would have been arrested , " Emil Groteschele argued . " At some point Hitler and the SS would have stopped . Face it . If every Jew who was arrested had walked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shootingat the local heroes , how long would the Nazis have kept it up ? At around a few hundred they would have started to think twice . At a few thousand they would have started to shake a bit . If it got to twenty thousand , they would have called it off . But the first Jews who shuffled quietly off to108 FAIL-SAFE THE ORGANIZED MAN 109death camps or hid like mice in attics were instruments of destruction of the rest . " Groteschele knew that his father considered all of life a battle . He was a complete Darwinian ; so much so that he never expressed self-pity for his fall from master surgeon to journeyman butcher . " It 's a new environment . I 'm not as efficient as the Amer- icans , " the muscular determined man said in a pitiless voice , as if he were talking of someone else . " The American was bred for this environment ; the weak ones disappeared long ago . I was bred for a softer environment : Jewish ladies with too much fat , rabbis with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lox , matzoth balls . " He stared at his son . " Every group protects itself , just as the individual does . Do n't waste time whining . Be good enough to get into the group you want . " His son had taken the advice seriously . He attacked knowl- edge as if it were an enemy . By the time he was a senior he had won every academic honor in the Cincinnati public schools . When Groteschele went off to a small Ohio college he had three separate scholarships and not the slightest notion of what he wanted to study . His first year he took liberal-arts courses and studied his classmates . It was reassuring . They were un- certainly motivated , pleasant , anxious about dates , inattentive to lectures , obsessed with material objects  --  cashmere sweaters , convertibles , record players , stolen college banners . They were the new Jews , Groteschele thought , binding themselves with the invisible links of possessions , but they lacked the drive and ability to absorb punishment that the real Jew had . Groteschele majored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He learned nothing from talking to his classmates . Instead he sought out the brightest professors on the campus and questioned them . He pushed them on what American industry would be like in five years . Their advice was unanimous . The nation would be at war or finishing a war and science would be going through a new surge of progress . It would be sparked by mathematics . He was a Phi Beta Kappa in his junior year and summa cum laude at graduation ; and did not , literally , know the names of more than a dozen of his classmates . Before Groteschele could find a job , waves of Japanese planes swept over Pearl Harbor and changed all of our lives . By now Groteschele had developed a prescience , a hard intuition , about what would happen in the future . He did it by the elimination of hopes and the substitution of the calculationof realities . He applied his father 's Darwinism in a methodicaland tough manner . He was no Cassandra but he tended always to look carefully and cautiously at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what was inevitable . His calculationled him to volunteer at once for military duty . He was selected for OCS and when he finished he was assigned to a group of officers who interviewed German prisonersas part of their processing before being sent to POW camps throughout the country . At first the job had a delicious undertone of vengeance to it and Groteschele did not deny this to himself . Day after day the men who had bullied Jews in the comfortable little towns of Germany , had swaggered in their party uniforms , had roared and lusted for war , now paraded in front of him . They were bitter-eyed , frightened , uncertain , homesick . Groteschele found them a disappointment and he was surprised at his own reaction . After a few weeks the interviewing became dull . It was impossible to stay angry at lines of potato-fat men with vacuouseyes who were slack and weary from the Atlantic crossing , who always whined their ignorance of concentration110 FAIL-SAFE THE ORGANIZED MAN 111camps . " Konzentration camps , ach nein , Herr Leutnant , " eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of it . " And then the inevitable statement about being a little man , a man in the ranks , a man who carried out orders , a man who did his duty , a man who was secretly anti-Nazi . After a few months Groteschele , because of his skill in German , was able to get himself transferred to the section which interviewed SS troopers . These interviews were longer , more concentrated , more meaningful . The interviewing officer could , in fact , question an SS man as long as he wished . Groteschelealways guided the conversation to the Jewish question . The SS men stared back at him , unafraid and their faces expressionless , and said , " Rabbits . The Jews are like rabbits , but without the speed of a rabbit . " Always it was a rabbit or an undernourished rat or a mouse to which they compared the Jews . It was during this time that Groteschele found himself trimming off excess weight and taking daily exercises . Finally he was doing hours of bar-bell exercises , pushups , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the SS troopers , his belly as flat , his face as expressionless . Always , just before the interview was over , Groteschele let slip the fact that he was a Jew . Never as a direct admission , always slyly and as if the prisoner had known from the start . It was the only thing that made the SS troopers crack , even a little . They would stare at Groteschele 's well-muscled body , his inscrutable face , his hard eyes . Then , for a moment in time , Groteschele could see fear in their eyes . It was gone instantly , the eyes shut , the expression lost . But it was enough for Groteschele . They had seen a different kind of Jew and it frightened them . By the time the war was over Groteschele had developed a new interest . It was the study of politics . Americans had masteredtechnology and the scientist would continue to be a hero for some time . But the real decisions , the real power would lie with those who understood politics . Competence in politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be as volatile as ever . He must , he reasoned , be an expert in politics but not subject to popular opinion . He calculated that with the GI Bill and the money he had saved he would be able to get a Ph.D . at an Ivy League college and still be a few thousand dollars ahead . His father had only one piece of advice . " If you are going to become a professor change your name to Groth , " he said . " American universities have too many German Jews . They will lose their tolerance for them . " Groteschele had not changed his name . It was the first time he had rejected his father 's advice , but now he was surer than his father about some things : the character of Americans , for instance , and the favorable attitude toward the Jewish intellectualin the academic world . This did not mean that he was insensitive to names . In fact he found them fascinating . He had , for example , noticed that his name was considered by most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not distinctively Jewish . He considered the possibility that he might even suffer somewhat from anti-German feeling , but he also remembered the guilty conscience which Americans had had over their anti-Germanism after World War I. All in all , when everything was added up , he calculated that he would benefit by sticking with his name and identity . Once this decision was made the plan was simple . He knew that it would take some luck , but he was also determined to do everything possible to minimize the importance of that element . The first thing was to become a protege of Tolliver . Groteschele sensed that Tolliver had en ego of formidable proportions . This was what led him to work in the area of112 FAIL-SAFE great sweeping diplomatic moves , intricate military strategies , and it was also what led him to an instantaneous and ferocious defense of his views . For the first year in graduate school Groteschele made no move toward Tolliver . He sat quietly in his classes and read every book and article the man had written . He watched the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrors of the academic world . By the end of the first year none of them regarded it as " the ivory tower " any more . By then they had learned it was more like Kafka 's Castle : a place of enormous tension , the scene of ununderstood conspiracies , a place of stalking and frantic flight from an unseen enemy . Groteschele watched some of the others break and remained impassive . Groteschele was certain that he would not be one of those who broke . He had been prepared for the fact that the big beautiful buildings and the book-lined studies and the quiet seminar rooms would really be scenes of battle . At the end of the first year Groteschele 's chance came . Tolliver published a book called Models for the Future War . The title had been a mistake . It suggested that Tolliver was , somewhow , advocating war . The reviews of the book were generally negative , some of them scathing . Groteschele read the reviews carefully . Finally he found one in a liberal monthly in which it was clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had skimmed the first few chapters and then used that much as a platform to expound is own theories about " the rising tide of militarism . " Groteschele wrote a 2,000-word letter to the magazine . It was a model of careful and biting analysis . The editor of the monthly , in a spasm of regret , sent Groteschele a check for $25 and published the letter as an article . Groteschele wisely did not send Tolliver a copy of the article , but inevitably Tolliver read it . He never thanked Grote- THE ORGANIZED MAN 113schele for the article , in fact , he never mentioned it . But in his second year of graduate work , Groteschele received a written invitation from Tolliver to be his research assistant . Groteschelenever worked so hard in his life . His eyes constantly burned from reading in bad library light . He had no time for exercise and could feel his body go slack , the fat start to gather , the hard muscularity he had liked disappear . Carefully and patiently Groteschele read all of the memos which Tolliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Washington . By studying the memos and by careful questioning of Tolliver , Groteschele found what he wanted : a public gap in American military thought . Stretching over a generation , the notion had arisen that America would never start a war . Even the most hardened of the military peoplecautiously skirted around this question . As a result a mood had grown up which made a discussion of America striking first impossible . A few officers had mentioned it in " off-the-record " briefings and had promptly been branded warmongers and their careers carefully altered so that they disappeared from the public eye . Even among themselves the military had developed a theory and lexicon and strategy which always skirted the idea of the United States starting a war . In his Ph.D . dissertation Groteschele attacked this taboo . He provided a respectable language and theory within which the " first strike " or " preemptive war " could be discussed . The name of the dissertation was The Theory of **26;3737;TOOLONG in a Thermonuclear World . He gave Tolliver five copies of the first draft of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copies . He sent them along to Washington . Groteschele curbed his hopes . He knew the copies of the dissertation might well disappear in the labyrinths of Washington . Or the central idea might be attacked by a powerful114 FAIL-SAFE THE ORGANIZED MAN 115person , or , even more damaging , be dismissed as trivial or nutty . But his luck held . One day the phone call came . " Dr. Groteschele , this is Colonel Stark of the Air Force in the Pentagon , " a calm voice said . " We have read your dissertationwith great interest and wonder when you can come to Washington to discuss it . " Technically Groteschele was not yet a Ph.D. , but he sensed this was not the time to point out that fact . " Colonel Stark , my schedule is fairly full for the next five or six days , " Groteschele said cautiously . " Maybe some time next week . " Stark cut in abruptly . There was an edge of irritation in his voice , but there was also something of respect . " Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Stark said . " After all , the security of the country is involved . " " Can you schedule the meeting for tomorrow afternoon ? " Groteschele asked abruptly . The colonel could and did . That afternoon meeting was not easy . For the first time since the captured SS troopers had made the remarks about Jews being like rabbits , Groteschele felt isolated . He was seated at the end of a long table . The other seats were occupied by six generals , five colonels , four civilians , and a secretary who was operating a Stenotype machine . Groteschele glanced at Stark . Stark 's face was completely expressionless . Groteschele did not bother to look at the others . He knew that none of them were yet committed . Quite suddenly Groteschele lost his nerve . The whole situation was preposterous . He was only a student who had once been an Army lieutenant and he was talking to professionals who had devoted their lives to the conduct and strategy of war . He sensed that he was about to make a fool of himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragic moment , he saw the rest of his life . He would slide , slide , slide , alwaysdownward . He smiled woodenly down the table as he calculatedwhere he would end , what the academic equivalent of his father 's butcher-shop job would be . He would be a grade-school teacher to a bunch of idiot children . With a terrible self-hatred he was aware of how he had physicallydeclined , was no longer taut and trim . To them , these men of power and elegance around the table , he must look like a fattening , white-grub academic . He looked at Stark , started to ask to be excused . " Excuse me , Colonel Stark , " Groteschele said and then paused . To his astonishment his voice came out cold and steady , without a tremor . His mouth was dry , his mind a shambles , his fingers had a quiver  --  but his voice was rock-hard . The decision was made for him . He would read the paper just as he had written it , using the one physical attribute that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading , he realized that his paper was a wild gamble . He reviewed alternative theories of modern thermonuclear war and , with all the deliberateness of a machine gunner , shredded them to pieces . Inevitably he must be damaging some of the men in the room . The knowledge made his fingers tremble even more . His mouth went cottony , but somehow the words continued to pour out with even more control . When he finished his review of " obsolete alternatives " he sensed that he had probably bruised every man in the room . There was nothing to do but go on . When he came to his own theory his voice became sharper , more incisive , although the words were more ambiguous . Without smiling , using his new vocabulary , he presented the alternative of the United States striking first . However , he never quite used those words . He took the people around the table to the edge of the abyss , forced them to look over the edge . Then , his language still cold , he described a situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact a mag-116 FAIL-SAFE THE ORGANIZED MAN 117nificent and glowing opportunity . The whole presentation took one hour and ten minutes . He was not interrupted once . When he had finished and had squared his papers in front of him on the table Groteschele stared straight ahead . The first person to speak was an elderly , white-haired man in uniform at the far end of the table . He had a deep and authoritativevoice that emanated from a face made of leather , and four stars decorated each shoulder . Groteschele had not noticed him before , but sensed at once that he was the senior officer in the room . He was , in fact , in charge of strategic plans for the Air Force and had deliberately not identified himself with any single point of view . Ruthless on weak logic and thin evidence , he had the reputation of listening with an open mind to any proposal that was sensibly presented . " Dr. Groteschele , speaking for myself only , I congratulate you on an extremely clear and lucid presentation of a complex problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands , smiled , and went on . " Your alternative is a difficult one . I believe it might be the right one . At the least it should be thoroughlydiscussed . " Groteschele relaxed . He was safe . He hardly heard the other voices as they murmured various reasons for approving Groteschele'spaper . When the briefing broke up , Stark invited him to dinner . Groteschele smiled , aware that the invitation had come after the briefing rather than before . He accepted . The dinner was small , but Groteschele knew that the men there were powerful . And he was the prize , the sought-after expert . Eyes turned to see him when he spoke . Others broke off their conversations to listen . " My God , did you hear the Old Man say that Dr. Groteschelemight have the right one ' ? " Colonel Stark said . " That 's the closest he has ever come to a commitment . " They stared at Groteschele . He did not smile . Calmly he went on to describe some of the implications of his position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically commuting to Washington . Conferencefollowed conference . Discussion papers appeared at regularintervals . Each trip , each conference , gave Groteschele access to new and valuable information . He was cleared for access to top-secret material . He had free communications with the experts working on the fantastic frontiers of defense developments . His doctoral dissertation was published under the title Counter-Escalation . It was instantly reviewed by Hanson Baldwinin The New York Times Sunday book-review section , and was the lead . Walter Millis reviewed it for the Herald Tribune . For a book of its type it sold very well , over 35,000 copies . Its reputation spread everywhere . Liberal journals attacked the book . A pacifist group burned it in Marin County , California , and then had second thoughts about book-burning and apologizedto a nonlistening public . The book was discussed on two national television panel shows . People who had never read it had violent opinions about it . With a speed that startled him he now became a public personage outside the defense and academic communities . He analyzed the reasons for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his subject matter which somehow flowed over onto Groteschele and gave him an aura . He was extremely careful never to discuss classified informationin public , but even so he could draw a picture of how the United States would look after a thermonuclear first strike , the awful seductions of surrender , the number of children who would suffer malignant genetic defects from radioactivity . Looking coolly at a room full of people he would tell them how many decades it would take the survivors of a thermo-118 FAIL-SAFE THE ORGANIZED MAN 119which agreed to give him half-time duties for a single semester , but to pay him a full salary . The university also had bought a commodity , a name , a reputation , and knew it . So much had changed for Groteschele so quickly . He thought briefly of his relationship with women . He was not handsome or attractive sexually , and he never had been . He had always explained it to himself by saying that women who were otherwise attracted to him were repelled by his mind . But this , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corridorsof the Pentagon , groups of secretaries stared at him with tight little fascinated smiles . He nodded but did not speak . To his surprise , brilliant and beautiful women sought him out . If he wanted , so it seemed , he had only to stand still at a cocktail party , scan the women speculatively , settle on one . . . and then let the situation develop at the woman 's initiative . The course often led him to her bed . Groteschele was married and had a fifteen-year-old daughter . Wife and daughter were strangely identical : slight , nervous , possessed of a thin prettiness . His daughter was a brilliant studentand it was her academic record which Groteschele found most attractive about her . Like the wives of many busy and successful men , his wife had faded away into a cool domestic haze . He had married her in Cincinnati years ago and at the time she had had the freshness of youth and it had seemed an appropriate union . Groteschele never took her on trips and when he was home their conversations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life was extramarital , but the knowledge gave her relief . She had never really enjoyed sex , and after Counter-Escalation there had been something about her husband 's sexual behavior which disturbed her . She felt ravished and quite impersonal even when locked together with him  --  as if she were nameless to him , an anonymous figurenuclear war to regain the standard of living of medieval days . He could see the audience stiffen , tongues licking at the corners of their mouths , the signs of nervousness and fascination multiply . Groteschele knew that he was regarded as a magician . The awesome powers on which he was expert , the facts of life and death and survival , the new cabalistic language of the nuclear philosophers and high scientists of physics , were merely matters of fact . But the layman , the rich socialite , the industrialist , the politician , endowed Groteschele with control of the things he described . The attention and the flattery were deeply pleasing to Groteschele . He did not disguise the fact from himself . He handled the incidental aspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more money , and Groteschele turned it over to an expert business manager . He learned to dictate into portable dictating machines while riding taxicabs or airplanes . He learned that it was dangerous to get drunk the night before an important meeting . He became a consultant to various foundations and business firms , but selected them with great care . He wanted nothing to impair his relationship to the Federal government , for he knew full well that his status in Washington and the information which he obtained there were the sources of his power . Groteschele went through three different administrationswithout threat . Many of the high military officers and policy-makers did not agree with him , but he was a valuable commodity . He was an innovator , a barb , an egghead with a steel-trap mind , and even those who disagreed with him violentlyknew they were dutybound to consider the alternatives which his thinking produced . Groteschele had been , after the success of his book , besiegedby academic offers . He evaluated them very carefully . He finally chose a distinguished university close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep rage . She tried to convince herself it was passion , but knew it was not . Passion had recently led Groteschele to an experience that shocked him profoundly in that it revealed so starkly the wellspringsof his power . It had started at one of those frequent off-the-record discussions with a group of high-level businessmenand political leaders . This one had been in Washington , the Metropolitan Club . Only a highly selected group were present that evening , about twenty-five men and women altogether . During drinks , one woman had stood out . Elegant , slim and lithe , she was a woman from a world he did not know . He sensed that she had a competence with men that had becomealmost arrogance . He had seen a few others like her . They gave off the subtle signs of wealth , family background , education and boredom . It was like a number of elegant odors in the air . It also had something to do with the smile : such women smiled infrequently and never at women . When they smiled at a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the simper or of the coquette in it . Men for such women were not a diversion , they were a necessity . Groteschelesensed this and felt somehow threatened . He avoided such women . The speech went well . It was a variation of the same one he gave them all . They never wanted to hear anything new , they just wanted to hear it from him . Afterward , over more drinks , little groups came up to present pet arguments . He looked around the room , wondering when they would start to break up . No sign yet . He could not leave too early . Part of his $750 fee involved just this sort of boredom . There was a slight tug at his elbow . He turned around . It was his hostess and just to the side the woman , the elegant one . " Evelyn , this is Walter Groteschele , our famous guest ; EvelynWolfe . Evelyn has been dying to meet you . She 's made mepromise to take a small group to a bar so she can hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fled . " She overdid it a bit , but I would like to talk to you , " Evelyn Wolfe said . Eight of them wound up in one of those countless chic hotel bars of Washington . Evelyn Wolfe sat next to Groteschele and in a few moments he had the bewildering sensation that they had somehow been cut off from the others at the corner table , almost as if some barrier to sound had been drawn around him and Evelyn Wolfe . Groteschele slowly began to realize that this was an extraordinarily attractive woman . She was intelligent , she was poised , mannered , informed , and intense , but he had met at least a score of women that possessed these qualities . What she possessed in addition was a kind of burning intensity , a hard focusing of all of her emotions on some undefined objective . She did not converse . She aimed at a target . By the time they had had four scotch and waters Groteschele realized that the target was himself . Normally he would have been flattered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This woman had an almost cobra-like manner of following what he said . Her beautifully coifed head , her face marred only by a mouth that was too small , actually wove back and forth with slight undulations as Groteschele talked about war games , the strategy of surrender , megatons , and Doomsday systems . Most people , especially women , listened to Groteschele 's description of American and Soviet tactics with a kind of unconcealed look of either bafflement or horror . Groteschele could not make out the look on Evelyn Wolfe 's face . He only knew that her concentration was enormous . She spoke very little . When he described the Doomsday system , hinting that it was semiclassified , she closed her eyes for a moment and a slight smile started at the corners of her mouth. 122 FAIL-SAFE " Beautiful , " she said . Just that single word unaccompanied by an expression of horror or astonishment or dismay . For a moment Groteschele 's careful poise was broken . He went on automatically talking about the likeliest survivors of an all-out thermonuclear war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ macabre description , of letting people down easily . They would be the most hardened of convicts , those in solitary confinement . Another group likely to survive would be file clerks for large insurance companies , because they would be housed in fireproofed rooms and insulatedby tons of the best insulator in the world , paper . " Then , my dear Miss Wolfe , imagine what will happen , " Groteschele said , feeling himself regaining his poise . " The small group of hardened criminals and the army of file clerks will war with one another for the remaining means of life . The convicts will have a monopoly of violence , but the file clerks will have a monopoly of organization . Who do you think will win ? " Evelyn Wolfe looked straight at Groteschele . Then she shook her head . Groteschele was confused . " I would like you to take me home now , " Evelyn Wolfe said , and she was up on her feet and into her mink coat before he responded . She did not say good-bye to the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she and Groteschele left . They were in Groteschele 's car and three blocks from the bar before Evelyn Wolfe spoke . " You were being mischievous about the war between the convicts and the file clerks , " she said , leaning her head back against the seat . " In fact , you know that no one will survive the Doomsday system . That is the beauty of the whole thing . " " No one , Miss Wolfe , has ever called it beautiful before , " Groteschele said with a laugh . THE ORGANIZED MAN 123 " They have been afraid to , " she said . " But that is what they feel . " " You mean that everyone is possessed by the death-wish ? " Groteschele asked in his best professorial manner . " No , damn it , do n't be so deliberately stupid , " she said sharply .

Quite literally everyoneon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savagely . " Damn it , I wish I were a man and a man who could push the button . I would not push it , you understand that . But the knowledge that I could . " She shivered in her mink coat . As Groteschele turned off of Massachusetts Avenue and threaded through Rock Creek Park , he felt a sudden hard understanding cross his mind . It was not he , Groteschele , the physical man , who was attractive to women . It was Groteschele , the magic man , the man who understood the universe , the man who knew how and when the button would be pushed . He was a master of death and somehow that gave him potency . " Why would n't you push it ? " Groteschele asked softly . " There it sits . More power in that button than anyone in all time has ever possessed . But it 's never used until you push the button . Why not push it ? " " Because I would die along with everyone else , " Evelyn Wolfe said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Groteschele felt a very deep excitement . " That is one statement you do not really believe , " he said with authority . " Do you think that life is the most important thing to a person ? You do n't think it for a moment . You know I do n't . I can name a dozen ways of living to which you would prefer death . " 124 FAIL-SAFE THE ORGANIZED MAN 125She was leaning back against the seat , her eyes closed , the lacquer of sophistication dissolved from her face . She looked curiously young . Like a hungry young girl . " Go on , " she said . It was the first time that night she had implored him . " Knowing you have to die , imagine how fantastic and magical it would be to have the power to take everyone else with you , " Groteschele said , spinning out what he had never said to himself . " The swarms of them out there , the untold billions of them , the ignorant masses of them , the beautiful ones , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . all of them and their plans and hopes . And they are murderees : born to be murdered and do n't know it . And the person with his finger on the button is the one who knows and who can do it . " The sound Evelyn Wolfe made was not a moan . It was the sound of wonderment that a child makes . . . even if the child sees cruelty . " Stop in one of those little side roads , " Evelyn Wolfe ordered . Groteschele obeyed . The moment that he turned off the motor her neat trim head struck at him . It was like nothing he had ever experienced before . She kissed him violently and then whispered words in his car at the same time that her hands moved over his body . In one way he felt raped , attacked by someone stronger than himself . At the same time her words were words of the most extreme submission , bringing out every bullish impulse in his body . He never recalled perfectly his feelings . It was too quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscenity , of feeling a child under his hands and knowing she was a woman , of her words ending and her hoarse breathing beginning , of a savage pride that his softening body was capable of so much , of all this happening in the little universe ringed round by gearshiftand leather seats and instrument panel , of soft little hands that arched into claws , of the sound of cloth ripping , of expensiveperfumes mixed with the smell of her , and , chiefly , that this was a complete surrender . When finally he placed her small body in the corner of the car he knew she was satisfied . But he was wrong . Her eyes still glittered and she came back across the seat at him . She took his hand and raised it to her lips . She kissed the palm of his hand and then taking his little finger in her mouth she softly sucked it and then bit it so sharply that he jerked . Suddenly , in a way from which he had always protected himself , Groteschele realized that in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . In one way , the public way , he was a respectable high priest of civic death . This dialogue he had raised from a secretive conversation to a respectable art . It was a game at which he was exquisite . Almost by his own single-mindedness and wit he had introduced to a whole society the idea that a calm and dispassionateand logical discussion of collective death was an entertainment . By refinements and logical innovation he had made municipal death a form of style and a way of life . But now , with his body aching and sweat soiling his shirt , he realized that in him there was also a personal beast of death . He realized that he had always feared women because in each of them there was the buried but inextinguishable desire to love a man to death . Evelyn Wolfe was simply more obvious and direct about it than the others . She would , without mercy and as if it were her due , draw the energy and juices and fluids and substance from his body through the inexhaustible demands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life distinguishedbetween sex and love . And now it was too late. 126 FAIL-SAFEHe pulled his hand away from Evelyn Wolfe 's mouth , started the car , and , accelerating wildly , shot through Rock Creek Park . He roared a single great peal of laughter as the car left the park . The black internal beast of death he would never rec- ognize again . And he would not have to , for he had the other great and public death as his amulet . It was enough for any man . And it was more than most had ever had . When they got to Evelyn Wolfe 's house , she leaned toward him and invited him in . He reached over and gave her a short savage slap across her open mouth . She did not recoil , she did not cry , she did not even move . She simply sat silently for a moment , her eyes crystalline with a sense of loss . She waited a full fifteen seconds and then opened the door and walked firmly up to her house . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haste or any sign either that he had exerted himself to get there or that he worried about what lay ahead . In the four hours and twenty minutes that he had been awake , he had or- ganized the briefing he would give that day , anticipated the reactions of certain secretaries and generals , and decided upon the arguments he would hold in reserve to counter their pos- Bible challenges . It was going to be a more than usually satisfying day . The President was looking at his pencil intently . He held it up to the light , seemed to be studying the lettering on its side , to wonder at its six sides , to admire the point . Buck looked at his watch and felt a dull shock : it was only 10:38 . As the time spun out , a long second after a long second , like half-frozen drops unable to separate themselves from a namelessmass , Buck became calmer . The pencil is like a totem to the President , he thought . He looks at it and thinks of other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the President . It was only twelve years . For the first time he realized the maturity of the man facing him . Somehow it made Buck sad , gave him a sense of loss . There was no way , and he knew it deeply , that he could ever overtake this other man in experience , in toughness , in drive , in durability , in span . It gave Buck no great sense of regret and surely not of128 FAIL-SAFEenvy ; it was merely that until that moment he had thought everything was possible . Not that he wanted to do everything , but he wanted it to be theoretically possible . But he knew that in ten times twelve years he could not become like this man across the desk . " Buck , this may all be over in the next few minutes , " the President said , turning the pencil slowly , looking away to see Buck . " It probably will be . The bombers will find out their mistake and turn around and head back or we will make radio contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why they flew past their Fail-Safe point and we ca n't raise them by radio . By itself neither event is catastrophic . But this particular situationhas never occurred before . The entire positive control system depends on our ability to maintain verbal contact by radio . That 's why we are here . Possibly it will get very sticky . " The President paused . Buck knew he did not have to respond , but he found himself speaking . " I do n't know about the details , Mr. President , " Buck said , surprised at his own words , " but if the military people were sure it was something they could solve themselves they would n't have called you . You 're down here because they know it is a serious problem . " The President stopped turning the pencil . " You interested in politics ? " he asked . Buck paused . " No , sir , not particularly . " " I remember . You 're studying law . " " Yes , sir . " Again Buck was amazed by the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a nice political feel , " the President said . " Kogan in Omaha has instructions to get through to me in a number of very specific and detailed situations . He also has one general instruction just in case something happens that the specific instructions do n't cover . You stated the general instructionTHE PRESIDENT AND THE TRANSLATOR 129just now : whenever anything occurs that looks serious get on the red phone . " The President paused again . He looked back at the pencil . " Look , Buck , if things get really serious we might have to use the hot wire ' which connects me with the Kremlin , " the President said and paused . " For the first time . " Buck knew that late in 1962 Washington and Moscow had agreed to maintain a constant telephone connection between the American President and the Premier of Russia . It had promptly been labeled the " hot wire . " Buck also knew that it had never been used . For the first time since his phone rang that morning , a chill went through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the President went on , " but I do n't speak Russian . You do . You might have to translate for me and the translation has to be not only literally perfect , but it should catch every emphasis I intend and the tones I use to convey meaning . So from now on you listen to every conversation I have on the phone . As soon as the conversation is over I will tell you what I think of it . Do n't argue with me , but just make sure you understand what I feel . All right ? " " Yes , sir , " Buck said . " It 's new to me , but I 'll try . " The President leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes . " That 's all you can do . That 's all any of us can do . " When he spoke again it was in an intimate and completely unguarded manner , a kind of verbal free-association . " I 've talked to Bogan in Omaha twice since 10:30 , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not afraid of all the new equipment . If he 's worried , I 'm worried . O.K. Then I talked to Wilcox . New Secretary of the Army . He 's tough , but too tough for a new man . Too sure . We listen to him , but we take his advice slow . Very , very slow . Now the switchboard is trying to get Swenson . You know Swenson ? " 130 FAIL-SAFEThe President did not open his eyes . Buck realized that he was both relaxing and giving instructions at the same time . " No , sir , " Buck said . " I know he is Secretary of Defense , but that is all . " " To Swenson we listen and if he gives advice we take it all , " the President said . " Unless I tell you otherwise , whatever Swenson says is what I think . " The phone rang and the President opened his eyes and nodded at Buck to pick up his phone also . " Mr. President , it 's Swenson at the Pentagon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my own office , but have an urgent call to come to the Big Board room . There was also the word to call you . " The voice stopped . There was no apology or hesitation , merely that Swenson had conveyed all the information he felt pertinent . " It might be nothing , Swenson , " the President said . " It might be big trouble . One of our groups of Vindicators flew through its Fail-Safe point and is headed toward Russia . Positive Control has broken down . Omaha does n't know how it happened . I talked to Wilcox in your Big Board room and he does n't either , but he is talking tough . I 'd like you to get down there and be ready for anything . Keep that college professor , Groteschele , there and do n't let the military boys drown him out . Also Blackie , General Black , is there . Keep him there whatever happens . " " Any particular reason , Mr. President ? " the Secretary of Defense asked . " No . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and trust him in any situation , " the President said with no apology . " Yes , sir , I understand , " Swenson said . " Anything else ? " " That 's all , " the President said . The phone clicked dead instantly and without a farewell salutation . THE PRESIDENT AND THE TRANSLATOR 131The President grinned at Buck . " Wastes no time , " the President said , " I wish I liked the son- ofabitch a little better . All I can do is respect him . But that 's enough . " Buck had seen Swenson from a distance , but had never heard him talk . Even so he knew a good deal about the man . He was something of a legend , a fable , in a capital which was accustomed to unusual men . Swenson looked like a clerk who had come to power by mistake . He was thin , shy , easily embar- rassed , and at the same time abrupt , incisive , and cold . Socially he seemed to be a man who wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from contact . He dressed with an unmis- takable flair for the totally inconspicuous , almost as if his clothes were camouflage . A Time cover story had stated , " He is the only self-made millionaire in the United States who looks as if his clothes were bought by his wife off the racks at a discount house . " In high-school and college class photo- graphs Swenson was the person no one could remember . Meet- ing him face to face it was impossible to conceive of Swenson as a bold administrator , a courageous innovator . It took powerful and sensitive men only a few minutes , how- ever , to realize that when they faced Swenson they faced an equal . If they were especially perceptive they sensed that in a peculiar , understated and almost eerie way Swenson was their superior . He had a calm , steely mind that would , if Swenson had allowed it full swing , have been dazzling . But he went to great pains to conceal his extraordinary intelligence . Swenson listened carefully to everyone in whom he had confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was said . The moment that there was a flaw in logic or a missing piece of evidence he asked a quiet question . Talking to Swenson was not a task that the average man liked . It was too much like a quiet and merciless interrogation. 132 FAIL-SAFEIn his months in the Pentagon Swenson had quietly shifted dozens of admirals and generals out of important positions on the basis of a five-minute conversation with them . Men of the first quality , men who possessed the capacity for real power and a deep intuition , responded quickly to Swenson . Lesser men never quite understood Swenson . They were not around him long enough . Quietly and without injury to their reputations , they were disposed of . Swenson could not tolerate incompetence . The President picked up the red phone . He nodded to Buck to pick up his phone . " Get Omaha again , " he said . The big clock on the wall showed 1040. 9THE VINDICATORSEarlier that morning , while it was still dark , Lieutenant ColonelGrady , the commander of Group 6 , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold , harsh , unblinkingfloodlights of the airstrip . It is a dream bomber , Grady thought . On the ground it looks ungainly . Its wings droop . Its landing gear is very high to allow a great sleek pod to be slung under the regular fuselage . The pod contains extra bombs , or fuel , or air-to-air missiles , or deception apparatus . The pod is beautifully streamlined and makes the Vindicator look somewhat more muscular . On the ground , however , motionless and quiet , the Vindicator has the flamingo look of long improbable legs attached to a powerful body . Once aloft , however , the Vindicator is sheer beauty . The wings rise , the landing gear retracts , and the Vindicator has a graceful jeweled lapidary look . Inside it is even more sophisticatedand elegant . Although it is an enormously intricate piece of machinery , it is flown by only three men . Everything has been133134 FAIL-SAFE THE VINDICATORS 135miniaturized , transistorized , servo-reinforced , and automated . It is flown by a pilot , a bombardier , and a weapons operator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it could fly , fight , and drop bombs served by only a single man . There was more than an esthetic and mechanical reason why older men like Grady who flew the Vindicator loved the plane . They realized , some of them , with all the agony of a doomed love affair , that it was probably the last of its type . Maybe the RS-70 would be something like the Vindicator , but the old-timers knew they would not fly them . For them the Vindicator was the last plane . The Vindicator had pushed the cooperation between men and machinery to its uppermost limit . The next plane would surely be so fast , complicated , and intricate that it would be flown without humans aboard . The plane would , in fact , be a guided missile . But the Vindicator crew , Grady thought proudly , still exercisesjudgment , the plane still responds to our hands . Our eyes scan the countless instruments . We must bring her screamingand protesting in for taut landings . The bombardier and weapons operator walked by Grady and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airmen they did not glance at the Vindicator . They squeezed into the plane , map cases in their hands , eager to get into their burrows , fasten on their helmets and set about their tasks . Grady looked up once more at the molded perfection of the Vindicator 's shape , ignoring her ungainly landing gear , and climbed aboard . Two minutes later he had her screaming down the runway . Behind him five other Vindicators leaned into the take-off . Three hours later they were 60,000 feet in the chill air over Alaska . It was just turning daylight . Once seated and strapped into the Vindicator , the three-man crew can not move about . The plane is so full of machinery that the three tiny places which the men occupy hold themas tightly as individual burrows . They can talk on the intercoms and they can , if they wish , also talk normally to one another by removing the lower part of their face plates . But the crew almost never talk except over the intercom ; in fact , the crew members make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their training had discouraged it , and partly because they are seldom close friends . It had recently become SAC policy to circulate crew membersat random among planes . The objective was to get identicalperformance from all men so that they acted as identical units of a class rather than as individual personalities . Given the cost and the speed and the importance of a Vindicator , no one wanted to count on camaraderie or crew morale for a mission to be successful . There were no brothers-in-arms aboard a Vindicator , Grady thought . He had met his two crewmen before , but had never talked with them at any length . He would not , he knew , talk much to them while aloft . Each man 's burrow was also his duty . Within eyesight were hundreds of dials to watch , gauges to check , knobs to turn . In case of a fatal emergency each man 's burrow would be automatically catapulted out from the plane at an enormous speed and , containing its own oxygen and control system , would bring the crew member safely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theory , but no one had yet been catapulted at maximum speed from a Vindicator without sustaining grave injuries . At maximum speed the ejection capsules were travelingfaster than bullets , and the air , so soft and gentle when still , was suddenly hard and brutal . When ejected a man was whacked around unmercifully in the tumbling , spinning capsule . It was something Vindicator crews tried not to think about . For all these reasons the crewmen of the Vindicator were136 FAIL-SAFE THE VINDICATORS 137a proud and highly qualified lot . Even in their loneliness they took a pride , for the great glistening smooth-packed machinery they flew also gave them a sense of self . The fact that they were locked into the mechanism , embraced by it , yet in control while at their positions gave them a feeling both of individuality and of being bound tightly to an organization . At 0530 the flight of Vindicators was topped-off with jet fuel from two huge jet tankers . They performed the operation flawlessly , sucking thousands of gallons of fuel from the tankers in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each plane locked into the V-shape of the group , not varying position by more than a few feet although they were flying at over a thousand miles an hour . Beneath them the darkness of the land began to break , immense chains of mountains shoulderedup into the faint light , a glacier glittered icily . They received the radio order to fly toward their Fail-Safe point without comment . They had all done it before . Grady led the group in a great sweeping arc through the sky . They picked up speed and still maintained flawless position . Grady felt the pride of a perfect performance as they completed the change of course . They flew in a nonevasive arrow-straight line . Evasive action was useless at this point and merely expendedfuel . Captain Thomas , the bombardier , handed Grady a form which said " Fuel range past Fail-Safe estimated 3,020 miles . " Grady came up on the intercom and acknowledged the written form . " Thomas seems all right ! " Grady thought to himself . He looked over at the captain . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dark eyebrows , and a few square inches of white skin . The rest of Captain Thomas ' face was covered by a helmet , oxygen mask , and microphone . Grady looked back at Lieutenant Sullivan , the weapons operator . Seeing only theeyes , he realized with a shock that their acquaintance was so slight he could not even reconstruct in his mind what Sullivan looked like . But he was impressed with Sullivan 's hands : they had long sensitive fingers and when they moved , to touch a knob or control , they moved with an absolute precision and a definite and utter mood of assurance . Grady , Thomas , and Sullivan , Grady thought to himself . No good war novel here . The whole damn crew is Anglo-Saxon . What we should have is a Jew in it and an Italian to give color . He almost came up on the intercom to mention this , but stopped himself short . Because of his seniority , Grady had missed the intensive indoctrination which the younger crew members had gone through at various training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they seemed to have almost no sense of humor about their work , and besides , these boys had n't read the war novels . For a moment , a quick piercingslice of time , Grady felt like an old man , part of an older generation . In the next moment he forgot everything , for Thomas handed him the clipboard with the information that they were a hundred miles from the Fail-Safe point . At once , with a sense of exquisite control which was very deep in his muscles and his brain , he began a long sweeping curve which would bring him just to the edge of the Fail-Safe point . He knew without having Thomas check that the other five Vindicators had begun to turn with him . This , for Grady , was why he had joined the Air Force . It was an act of pure artistry and it filled him with a thrill of pleasure . He felt the Vindicator tilt , saw the wings move , felt a slight change in pressure against his harness and knew that they had probably lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the sky . Grady hoped that they would stay at the Fail-Safe point for a few minutes this morning . It was the one time when he could still fly the138 FAIL-SAFE THE VINDICATORS 139plane with a sense of independence and autonomy . For at the Fail-Safe point the group commander could fly random patternsat random speeds as long as he did not go beyond the Fail-Safe point , and did not vary his altitude by more than 1,000 feet . The sun shone jaggedly on the western horizon . It shot out long rays of bright light which illuminated the high darkness , but left the land black . The outline of distant mountains was etched sharp . Once , by some miracle of refraction , a whole glacier flamed blue-white for a moment and then died . The flash of the glacier reminded Grady that the people on the land were still in darkness and it gave him pleasure . In a few more minutes they would be in first light , but now the great altitude of the Vindicators gave them sole possession of the light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of satisfaction . He knew it was a childlike sense of superiority . It meant nothing . But it was precisely for these seeminglychildlike reasons that Grady had wanted to fly . This time his pleasure was short . At once he was thinking of the day when planes would fly themselves ; when flying would become a combination of engineering and science and men would be merely spectators . Quite reflexively , as if to demonstrate his control , he put the Vindicator into a sharp turn . The enjoyment of it , Grady thought , can only be man 's . Machines could probably do it just as well , but they would have no sense of excitement , no pleasure at the beauty of the six planes holding their positions while traveling at high speeds . The outboard planes , with longer sweep to cover , would put on just enough speed to maintain the V-shape . " Sullivan , how is the group holding formation ? " Grady asked over the intercom . " Perfectly , sir , " Sullivan said instantly . " Even No. 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Grady smiled behind his oxygen mask . He must remember to compliment Flynn , the pilot of No. 6 , when they landed . The No. 6 plane labored under a special disadvantage . Althoughshe carried no thermonuclear weapons , the No. 6 plane was , paradoxically , the most heavily laden of any plane in the group . In every group this was the plane that carried a maximum load of defensive apparatus and devices . It was this plane which could jam the enemy radar gear , receive and analyze and attempt to foil enemy attack , spread decoys throughout the skies , and act , as Grady had always figured in his mind , as a wise but tuskless elephant might do in leading a group of muscular young bulls into action . The No. 6 plane was always flown by specialists who thoroughly understood the incredible intricacy of its weird perceptions , methods of analysis , and means of defense . Grady moved the yoke and the Vindicator leveled off . The slight strain on his harness relaxed . He glanced around his limited arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a deep endless blue . Then he received two signals which made his body go rigid even before his mind understood fully what had happened . In his earphones there was a sudden beeping noise repeated in short staccato bursts . Automatically he looked down at the Fail-Safe box which was installed between him and the bombardier . For the first time in his flying career the bulb on top of the box was glowing red . Then his intellect caught up with his reflexes : this was the real thing . Both he and Thomas looked up from the Fail-Safe box simultaneously . Thomas ' eyes seemed nonchalant . Grady 's response was unhesitating . He reached for the S.S.B. radio switch . This would140 FAIL-SAFE THE VINDICATORS 141put him in direct contact with Omaha . It was the Positive Control double-check . Immediately , Grady knew , he would hear from Omaha the reassuring " No go . " Something had gone wrong with the Fail-Safe box . It would all be corrected . He flipped on the S.S.B. switch . A loud , pulsating drone filled his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission , sir , to verify , " Thomas said crisply . " Permission granted , " Grady said automatically . To his own ears Grady 's voice sounded small and chilled . He was stunned at the tonelessness in Thomas ' voice , the expressionless look in his eyes . Grady reached into the map case beside his seat and took out a pure red envelope which bore in black letters the words " Fail-Safe  --  Procedure March 13 . " Thomas was taking out an identical envelope from his map case . As Grady 's fingers tore open the envelope he looked at the face of the Fail-Safe box . There were six apertures , each of them about an inch square . Always , until this moment , the apertures had been blank . Now in bold white figures there were three letters and three numbers : CAP  --  811 . The Fail-Safe box was an intricate machine made up of a radio receiving device , plus six wheels , each of which contained either all the letters of the alphabet or the numbers from 1 through 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a direct signal put into the machine by the Intelligence officer on each base and unknown to any crew member , letters and numbers would appear in the aperture . Grady got his envelope open and took out a thick white 3- by 3-inch card . On the top line was the date and below it were the words and letters " CAP  --  811 . " He held the card directly over the machine to make sure that he was not mis- taken . Thomas , in the meanwhile , had taken out an identical card which he held next to Grady 's . They both confirmed that the machine was showing the correct code sequence for the day . " Request permission to authenticate on the secondary channel , sir , " Thomas said . " Permission granted , " Grady said . Thomas removed a red plastic cover from a dial which was labeled FAIL-SAFE ALTERNATE CHANNEL . Without a moment 's hesitation he turned the dial to the right . Instantly the red light and the beeping stopped . The letters and numbers disappeared from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , felt his muscles bulging against the tight harness . His mind was utterly blank . In three seconds the beeping started and the light went on again . The Fail-Safe box was now receiving its signal on a different channel . When Grady looked at the six apertures they again said " CAP-811 . " Again Grady held his card directly over the apertures and Thomas held his card next to Grady 's . They checked . Grady felt a spasm of doubt , a kind of upwelling of disbelief . It had never happened before , it could not be happening now . He thought of alternatives : he could not radio General Bogan at Omaha . He could keep circling at Fail-Safe , hoping for some other form of verification . And then he looked at Sullivan and Thomas . They were looking at him casually , their eyes unblinking and unquestioning . They were innocently implacable . Grady felt as if his vertebrae had suddenly fused together . His hands did not shake but he felt all bone and muscle and cartilage . He was aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his exposed eyes . Grady felt that something had happened to the vital living parts of his body  --  the heart , brain , eyes , ears , and tongue had died . He felt for a moment that he would not be able to speak . He ordered his tongue to move , to speak the words he knew he must say. 142 FAIL-SAFE  --  THE VINDICATORS 143 " I read it as CAP-811 , " Grady heard his voice say . This was the procedure in which they had been drilled thousands of times , but the voice did not sound like that of Grady . It seemed to come from somewhere in the intercom system , to be a mechanical and inhuman voice . " I verify your reading as CAP-811 , " Thomas said . " We will now both open our operational orders , " Grady said , and again the voice did not seem to belong to him . Grady reached down for the envelope in the map case . For a brief second he saw Sullivan looking at him . Again he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with the exposed flesh squeezed tight by mouthpiece and helmet , told nothing . If the masks and helmets were off , Grady thought , would Sullivan 's face be filled with terror ? Somehow he doubted it . Sullivan looked back at his tubes and analyzers . Grady began to open the operational plan . Squarely on the middle of the envelope containing the plan and in small red block letters were the words TOP SECRET . In smaller black letters in the lower left-hand corner was asentence which said TO BE OPENED ONLY AT SPECIFIC ORDERS AND UNDER CURRENT OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS . In the lower right-hand corner were the words DESTROY BEFORE CAPTURE OR ABANDONMENT OF AIRCRAFT . The flap closing the envelopewas scaled at three places . The envelope was well designed to accomplish two purposes : it could not be opened without detection , but it could be opened easily . Grady broke the seals and looked at the familiar format of the operational plan . It was all contained on a single stiff piece of paper . The rest of the enclosures were alternative plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Grady knew gave the names of possible American agents within Russia and which would dissolve into a shapeless pieceof cellulose the moment it touched water , even the amount of moisture that one had in his mouth . The top line of the plan said : " Target : Moscow . " The second line said " Approach and penetration , " and described the altitude and speeds at which they were to fly . No. 6 plane was to take the lead . There were detailed instructions on what to do under varying conditions of fighter plane , missile , and antiaircraft attack . On another line there were instructions as to bomb placementand settings . Under optimum conditions twelve bombs would be laid symmetrically over Moscow to explode at an altitude of 5,000 feet , Vindicators to bomb from an altitude of 60,000 feet . In some unguarded and unclassified part of Grady 's mind there was a stunning montage of old motion pictures of bombs exploding at Eniwetok and Los Alamos and Bikini . The twelve great fireballs would gently touch and then feeding upon one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heloid shimmer of pure heat . Deliberately , and aware that this vision was part sensual , Grady snapped off the picture . Thomas ' large cool blue eyes were looking at him . " Do you want to come up on the TBS , sir ? " Thomas said . The TBS was a very low-powered radio which would carry only a few miles and was designed for communication between the planes in the group . Its signals were deliberately designed so that they could not be heard beyond a short radius . " Just a minute , Thomas , " Grady said . He felt a strong necessity to do something more but was not clear what . A dread sense of lonely helplessness engulfed him . He knew there was only one explanation for his jammed radio and the " go " order on his Fail-Safe box : the Russians had started an attack. 144 FAIL-SAFEFurther hesitation might play into Russian hands . He must follow his orders . This was what all his years of training had been about . No time now for doubts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes of the two strangers  --  the two magnificent technicians who might have been hundreds of other anonymous experts . Behind his mask he licked his lips . The four eyes rested lightly on him . They were without accusation . He imagined them to be burning with certitude , glowing with an innocent assurance . Indeed , why should n't they be ? The machines were with them . Somehow , in a way he could not understand , the four cool eyes soothed the nerve in Grady 's mind . He felt the surety of command flow back into him . When he spoke , his voice was for the first time his own and it was confident . " Switch on the TBS , Thomas , " Grady said . With utter confidencehe picked up the microphone and began to give penetrationorders to the group. 10THE BRIEFING1000 HOURSThere was a sergeant standing at the door of the conference room . He saluted Black as he approached . " General , they have moved the conference to the Big Board room , " the sergeant said . He shrugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know why , General . Scuttlebutt is that the Secretary of Defense is going to be there . That draws the flies , so they needed more room . " Black smiled at the ramrod-straight sergeant 's jazzy lingo ( probably a college boy " doing his time " ) , turned and almost bumped into General Stark . Stark had heard the sergeant . ' The two men started off for the elevator which would drop them down into the suspended concrete cube hundreds of feet below the Pentagon . " I think Swenson wants to see Wilcox in action , " Stark said . " I hear that he does n't think Wilcox was the best choice for SecArmy , so he may be along to roast him a bit . " 145146 FAIL-SAFE THE BRIEFING 147 " Maybe , " Black said , but he doubted it . Swenson would size up a new man but not roast him . The briefing was for Wilcox , the new Secretary of the Army , but beyond that Black did not try to follow Stark 's logic . Stark was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generals on the way up , but they were very different . Stark had made his way politically . He was quick , but he relied on the brilliance of others to form his career . Black had concluded that Stark would have made general on his own talents , but he enjoyed the Machiavellian role . He traded in gossip , inside dope , and a prescience for what would happen in the future . Stark 's being political was not because of laziness or doubts of his own ability . Indeed he worked with great energy and had ability , but he loved the intricacy of personality conflict , was fascinated with the struggle between powerful men . Had he been dull , he would have been a superb manager of prize fighters . Being brilliant , he was a manager of men with ideas . Stark had discovered Groteschele and had managed his career beautifully . As Groteschele became famous Stark became a general officer . " I read your memo on counterforce credibility the other day , " Stark said to Black . He paused . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . " Black nodded . It was Stark 's way of requesting that a subjectbe ruled off-limits . He was meticulous in mentioning these informal limitations . Stark played a hard and very tough game , but he played by the rules . Once when he was a chicken colonel a classmate had leaked an item to Drew Pearson . Stark , Black realized , was really morally outraged . He had systematically and with the certitude of a Torquemada broken the colonel 's career . " O.K. , but what I said in the memo about credibility still holds , " Black said . " It 's damned nonsense to spend billionsof dollars to develop a military posture ' which might or might not be credible to the Russians . Who needs more muscle now ? Neither side . It gets down to a guess in a psychological game , Stark . This thing of piling bombs on bombs and missiles on missiles when we both have a capacity to overkill after survivinga first strike is just silly . " " All right already , O.K. , O.K. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't argue it today . " " Not in front of the Big Brass , " Black said bluntly . " Oh , my God , Blackie , you 're so damned hard-nosed , " Stark said . They smiled at one another . The ground rules for the day had been laid down . The Big Board room was dominated by the huge illuminated board which occupied an entire wall . The room had the same information-receiving capacity as the War Room at Omaha , but it lacked the array of desk-consoles . This was a room where the Joints Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of Defense would gather in case of war . They would make decisions which would be implemented by other centers around the world . This was a room for strategy . Omaha , and all its counterparts , was a place for tactics . This was the room where the decisions were made . They were carried out elsewhere . The Big Board room showed its character . It was a mixture of the executive suite and a military headquarters . Stark and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board . In a random casual way they ran over various systems , cut in on streams of information , threw various projections onto the screen . At the moment , it was tuned in only to the SPADATS system , a shorthand phrase for " space data analysis . " The headquarters for SPADATS was located in Colorado Springs , but the information was projected onto the Pentagon screen with a clarity that was uncanny . As General Black148 FAIL-SAFE ' THE BRIEFING 149watched , SPADATS switched to a Samos III satellite orbiting high in the stratosphere . Words began to crawl across the bottom of the board . " SAMOS III #15 is moving 20,000 miles an hour , 300 miles above the earth , and has just been instructed ' to commencephotographing the transmitting pictures , " the words said . " It is making a routine scan of a part of Russia which includes a Soviet ICBM site . Selective discrimination follows . " The screen dissolved and then hardened up . The picture was different from the ordinary Mercator projection . This was an actual picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines of longitude and latitude . There was a range of mountains , black on one side , for it was dusk and the eastern side of the range was in shadow . There was the great twisting course of a river and the countless smaller tributaries that flowed into it . The rest of the landscape , seen from so high up , was brown and featureless , bathed in the soft magenta of sunset . In some parts of the screen there were great white clouds and Black estimated that the largest of them was actually a storm front over two hundred miles long . " The picture will now come to maximum close-up , " the words on the bottom of the screen said . General Black always enjoyed this particular process . It was marvelous , intricate , and it was dizzying . He always had to remind himself that the Samos pictures were being transmittedinstantly . What he saw was happening halfway around the world a split second previously . By a combination of processes done at Colorado Springs and in the Samos III itself the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were rushigntoward the earth . The picture took on definition with a speed that was terrifying . Water suddenly showed in the great river and the next second it glinted in the tributaries . Villages popped into viewas small rectangles and an instant later individual houses could be identified . Huge forests came into focus and then copses and then single trees . The picture centered on a cleared area pocked with the unmistakable circles of rocket silos . Scat- tered behind revetments were trucks . Casually , for this was only a drill , the picture bore down on one of the trucks . The rest of the ICBM reservation was squeezed out of the picture . The technician operating Samos #15 was pushing the equipment to its limit . It was a marvel to observe , an almost unbelievable scientific spectacle . It sent Black 's mind spinning ahead into the future . He had heard scientists discussing the ultimate possibilities of such long-range technical espionage . One day there would be more than a vague outline of a truck , its details would be clear and sharp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fuzzy picture now on the screen before him . . . . Two men were leaning against the truck . They wore leather boots , Red Army uniforms , and their caps were pushed back on their heads . One of them held out some- thing to the other . The definition became sharper , zoomed in closer , focused on the exchange . Gradually the huge screen was filled by four enormous hands , hair on the back of them , the fingernails dirty . Two fingers of one of the hands held a picture of a girl . The details were contrasty , not clear , but she had a round Slavic face , was smiling , and had her head twisted to one side in a coquettish manner . . . . At this point the picture on the Big Board dissolved and with it Black 's fanciful enlargement . The truck he had just seen on the Big Board was real , though , Black reminded himself . Its driver was completely unaware that his mission had been caught by a camera 300 miles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then projected another 2,500 miles and viewed on this screen with an interval of no more than one second be-150 FAIL-SAFE THE BRIEFING 151tween the action and its depiction on the screen . For the first time the Samos III , its marvelous camera and its future portent made Black restless . It seemed somehow an invasion of privacy , this subtle and soundless observation of anything on the surface of the world . Blackie , he said to himself , for a man who supported the U-2 fights , all versions of the Samos and a dozen other ventures , you are getting soft . He turned to Stark , determined to make small talk . " What do you hear about Wilcox ? " Black asked . " The usual stuff , but he pulled a smartie two days ago , " Stark said and laughed . " Someone sent him a two-page memo for circulation to the entire staff . Wilcox stuffed a sixty-page essay by Emerson between the two pages and approved it for circulation . It came back all duly initialed , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone in for a chewing-out session . They say the blood was ankle deep before he finished . " Black laughed . The story fit well with his mood . Wilcox sounded like he might liven things up a little . No wonder Stark was a little on edge over today 's briefing session . Black glanced idly around the room . It was filling up now . One group had gathered at the opposite side of the room around the red telephone which connected directly to the President at all times . It was like a fire-insurance policy . Your main hope was that it never would be used . Black walked toward the long conference table in the center of the room . It was an impressive slab , as if the designers had tried to combine a large board of directors ' table with a **26;3765;TOOLONG table . Around the long table , neatly placed , were high-backed leather armchairs . In front of each chair was a precise blotter layout , a fat , large new scratch pad , and two pencils , precisely arranged and guarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the center of the table , were sterling thermos jugs and official tumblers . Beyond the table on the other side along the wall was " the reservation . " There were two rows of slightly less impressive armchairs , carefully designed to show that their occupants , while significant , were the less important staff assistants . The barrier was invisible . Someone could , if he wanted and there was a vacancy , sit at the big table . But no " reservation Indian " ever made that mistake . He might hunger to sit at that table , but he would know precisely when he was qualified . By now the room contained about twenty men , over half of them in uniform . They had a sameness of look : graying , middle-aged , ruddy , powerful-looking men . Did men look this way because they were the power types , Black wondered , or were they chosen for power because they looked this way ? Black watched Stark making his way from group to group . Stark was obviously pleased today , pleased with himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbing doubts about credibility . It would be a Groteschele-Stark day . These briefings , necessary and valuable , were becoming increasingly unpleasant to Black . The disagreements were difficult to state , but once stated they had to be pursued and they were impossible to resolve . As much as Black loved SAC and the men he worked with in and out of the Air Force , for five years he had had the growing sensation that " things " were slipping out of control . The calculations of Soviet intention and capability had started as a straightforward and direct exercise in logic . But at some point the logic had become so intricate , so many elements were involved , so many novelties flowed into the system , that for Black it had blurred into a surrealistic world . We matched and surpassed their capability and then guessed at their intentions . They then ran a series of tests and surpassedour capability and guessed at our intentions . And then152 FAIL-SAFE THE BRIEFING 153we guessed what they guessed we were guessing . Meanwhile years ago each side had developed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise first strike . Black often had the sensation in a meeting that they had all lost contact with reality , were free-floating in some exotic world of their own . It was not just SAC or the Pentagon , Black thought . It was the White House , the Kremlin , 10 Downing Street , de Gaulle , Red China , pacifists , wild-eyed right-wingers , smug left-wingers , NATO , UN , bland television commentators , marchers for peace , demonstrators for war . . . everyone . They were caught in a fantastic web of logic and illogic , fact and emotion . No one seemed completely whole . No one could talk complete sense . And everyone was quite sincere . Black remembered when the sense of unreality had started . It was a few years before when Groteschele had brought up the Kahn example of what would happen if an American Polaris submarine accidentally discharged a missile at us . The submarine commander would have time to make radio contact and explain what had happened so that SAC would know the missile was an accident . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discussion . But Groteschele had persisted . The Soviets would detect the missile in flight , would know it was our accident and would detect the explosion . But they would worry about our reaction . How could they be sure that we knew it was our own missile ? Might they not fear our " retaliation " and , prompted by this fear , attack us in the confusion ? So might not the best Soviet tactic be to strike at once ? Indeed , might not the best strategy of each side , even if both knew it was an accident and both knew whose accident , be to strike at once ? They had , Black thought , slipped by that one cheaply . They had decided that all possible steps should be taken to assure against accidental discharge of a missile . Maybe he should resign his commission . It hit him again . It had been coming to a head within him for a long time . Curious , he thought : he could live with his conscience and with his beliefs in almost any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But SAC and especially his own role in SAC ( the link he furnished between operations and the Strategy Analysis and Evaluation Section ) made his private thoughts seem like rank heresy . But why did it torment him so much more than it did the others ? From the outside they looked happy in their jobs , but who could tell ? He supposed he looked as untroubled as they . A stir on the other side of the room caught his eye . There he was . Groteschele . It was as if he had opened a door from last night 's party and walked right into the Pentagon : the same confident , aggressive , jutting thrust . The same stride . In company with Groteschele came Wilcox , Carruthers , the Navy Chief of Staff , and Allen , of the National Security Council . Everyone in the room had observed the entry of the big brass at the same time . The room " knew " it . An instant before it had been a room with one personality , relaxed and informal . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all sorts of little ways hard to detect . It was the effort everyone was making to seem to behave as if the brass were not there that made the difference . Groteschele proceeded to the head end of the long conference table . As he did so everyone else began finding seats around the table . It was clear that the Secretary of Defense was either not coming or would arrive late and had sent word for the briefing to start . Stark handled the opening remarks easily and deftly . Then Groteschele began talking in his positive , slightly patronizing way . He announced the subject : accidental war . The subject154 FAIL-SAFEhad been cropping up in the news lately . There had been a few articles in magazines . The military people had , of course , been working on the problem for years and in detail . " In the old days , six months ago , " Groteschele said with a chuckle , " most of the talk about accidental war was what we now call the madman theory . " He went on about the possibility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world from the Communists . It had n't been a joke , as Black knew well . Groteschele 's reference was to the special psychological screening system which the Air Force had inaugurated in 1962 to assure that no " mentally unfit persons " would have contact with the preparationor discharge of atomic weapons . Black had been among the first within the Air Force to propose and support the program . He was not sure even now that the problem could be disposed of summarily . The men in SAC were trained for destruction . They were " preprogrammed " to attack Russia . " What frightened us was not so much the madman problem , " Groteschele was saying , " but its opposite : at the last moment someone might refuse to drop the bombs . A single act of revulsion could foil the whole policy of graduated deterrents . Say , for example , that some PFC at a transmitter simply decided not to carry out the order for an attack . That could ruin us right there . " It was behavior in a showdown that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The tests , the indoctrinations , the training  --  all were designed to convert normal American boys into automatons . " Automatons . That 's what some of our critics call them , " Groteschele said evenly . " But they are also patriots and they are courageous . And have n't we always honored the Marines simply because they did exactly what they were ordered to do ? " To hell with Stark , Black thought . " Professor Groteschele , one moment , " he said . " Is n't it trueTHE BRIEFING 155that the go ' reflex , the will to attack , is so deeply indoctrinated in our SAC people that even those who pass our psychological screening are more likely to err on the side of go , ' rather than on withdrawal ? " " At one point , General Black , maybe , " Groteschele said . He controlled his impatience with the interruption . " But we analyzedthe possibility and built in some protections . Even if you had a madman in command of a wing  --  even , General , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not carry out their will . " Groteschele glanced at SecArmy . Wilcox was bent forward attentively . Groteschele then launched into a description of the elaborate checks , decoding systems , and other devices designed to assure that war could not happen through human error . " It is impossible , quite impossible , " Groteschele concluded . " The statistical odds are so remote that it is impossible . Or as impossible as anything can be . The go ' process will not operate until the President orders it . Even then the Positive Control routine requires a double check . " Black hesitated . He knew Groteschele wanted to move on . But he also knew that Groteschele was skirting a real problem . " What if the President went mad ? " Black asked abruptly . " He is a man under considerable pressure . " Black , as some in the room knew , was the single person there who could , because of his friendship with the President , raise such a question . But Groteschele , with a pang of envy , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never seen the President . The shock in the room was palpable . The SecArmy frowned at Black . Groteschele glanced quickly at the SecArmy , then around the table . He knew he did not have to answer Black directly . " Then we would have trouble , " Groteschele said with a156 FAIL-SAFE laugh . He shrugged , held his hands up as if imploring for common sense . " But it is not likely . " The room relaxed . Black was still unsatisfied , but he knew when to stop . Still , he thought , it was possible . Woodrow Wilson had been President for two years after a stroke . High officials have cracked under the strain . Forrestal had jumped out a window . It was possible for the President to come down with paranoid schizophrenia , Black thought . Not likely , for American politics ruthlessly screened out the unstable person- alities , but a possibility . Maybe , Black thought , the whole damned game is taking me apart . He felt the diminutive terror start somewhere in his guts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sessions like this the individual stripes of hide were sliced off his skin , each one leaving him less intact , more pained . And yet , he thought desperately , this is where I belong , where I am needed , where I can contribute . He allowed his mind to wander , search- ing for the moment when the real face of the matador would be revealed , for the instant when the real sword would slice in between his shoulders and end his indecision . Groteschele was now proceeding to the possibilities of ma- chine error . This was new stuff . Nobody really knew anything about it . Groteschele was always the statistical type . It was odd how flesh-and-blood human events disappeared into num- bers . Groteschele was explaining that of course there was a remote mathematical possibility of machine error . He had calculated the error . In any year the odds were 50 to 1 against accidental war . This , Black remembered , had already been made public in the Hershon Report . But the report was several years old and the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they did not have access to confidential information . The situation was much worse than they had reported because everything had gotten more complicated . THE BRIEFING 157 " Putting it another way , " said Groteschele , " and with the present rate of alerts and the present computerized equipment , the odds are such that one accidental war might occur in fifty years . " " Does not the increasing intricacy of the electronic systems and the greater speed of missiles make that figure worse each year ? " Black asked . He had in mind the public warning , several years previously , by Admiral L. D. Coates , the Chief of Naval Research , which admitted what all insiders knew : electronic gear was becoming so complex that it was outstripping the ability of men to control it ; complexity of new generations of machines was increasing the danger of accidents faster than safeguards could be devised . The statement had never been countered but simply ignored . Groteschele paused , smiled tolerantly at Black . The SecArmyleaned toward one of his aides and asked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he talked quickly in SecArmy'sear . Black knew what he was saying : General Black is the professional heretic . " In theory , yes , " Groteschele said . " But we completely pre-test every component and every system is checked by another . The chance of war by mechanical failure is next to zero . " This was not true , but Black did not choose to contest it . He forced his anger down and deliberately looked at the Big Board . It was like a vast moving mosaic , decorative rather than functional . Blips appeared , grew bright , traveled short distances , then vanished . The Big Board was not taken seriouslyuntil the light over it indicated that someone had decided to come to some degree of alert . How many places in the world , Black mused , were there just such strategy boards run by just such computer systems , picking up , identifying , and discarding just such radar signals ? 158 FAIL-SAFE - THE BRIEFING 159Our big operation at Omaha , of course . Probably at least one other stand-by " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then there was the President 's bomb shelter : probably anothercomputerized strategy board layout there . Maybe there was more than one Presidential bomb shelter . Maybe one at Camp David , or the summer White House , or who knows where else . Then , in addition , he knew there was always , every minute of every day , a converted KC-135 aloft : a miniature , emergency " Omaha , " in case everything else should blow . Probably anotherone on some super aircraft carrier somewhere . Still another on one of the nuclear submarines . How many others ? Several in England , certainly , France , perhaps , and West Germany . Russia ? Yes , surely there would be almost as many as there are in the United States . Black knew that four KC-135s were reserved exclusively for Presidential use as a flying command post in case of emergency . Since 1962 they had been scattered about the country so that the President was never far from one . Whenever the President flew overseas one of these planes was quietly and unobtrusivelyincluded in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was similar . And the men in them , too . Today , throughout the world in each one of the Big Board rooms , staffed by busy , competent , dedicatedmen , probably the same signals were being received , analyzed , and projected . The big brass everywhere was watchingsimilar strategy boards , studying the same blips , thinking out , or talking out , the same strategic puzzles Groteschele was now discussing . Black plugged back into the discussion . Groteschele was now classifying various types of possible machine errors . Accidental war caused by some machine failure . Miscalculationby the computers , misinterpretation by the staff of humaninterpreters ( the " overriders " as the computer boys call them ) . And then the big one , electronic failure . Big , Black thought , because no one knows anything about it . We just know that in any system so complex and so dependent upon intricate electronic equipment , the possibility of electronic failure or error must always be borne in mind . " But the Positive Control Fail-Safe system is the ultimate protection against mechanical failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was the ultimate safety factor in the whole system . This was where it all rested . So , we were all reassured . And indeed , Groteschele was very reassuring today , except that his nervous chuckle kept getting in the way . Black understood why . Groteschele knew more than he was saying . It just was not that simple . Everyone knew it who had anything to do with the black boxes of the Positive Control system . Their components were 100 per cent double-checked on regularrotation schedules . Every possible condition to which the equipment might be subjected in operation was simulated . It was simulated in actual duplication systems and it was also simulated on computers with meticulously devised mathematicalformulas expressing every possible way the equipment might fail . On computers the bombers were " flown " and the " go " signals were " given . " Variable atmospheric conditions could be predicted , operationaldeterioration of the equipment could be estimated , vibrationcharacteristics of the Vindicator bombers could be factored in . Stress variables could be translated into mathematical formulas , and with these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the whole system had one big flaw in it . Nobody could ever be certain that the black boxes would actually work properly in a showdown . The reason was simple . There had160 FAIL-SAFEnever been a showdown , and there could never be a sure test showdown . A showdown meant war . The whole Positive Control system really depended on equipment that could never really be tested until the time came for its first use , and because of this nobody could ever really know in advance whether or not it would work right . The Fail-Safe machines could be truly tested only once : the single time they were used . There was ample evidence from the experience of the Electra planes and the now obsolete DC-6s that a serious flaw in an elaborate machine could survive every experimental situation  --  and then in real practice come completely unstuck . This was material for the grim inside humor which went the rounds of SAC gossip . The DC-6 had been a beautiful drawing-boardplane , except that the first ones to go into service caught fire in flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't calculated was what flight wind currents would do to fuel overflow spillage . The fuel was deflected by an invisible band of air to a point directly behind the engines where the airintakevents sucked in the gas spillage , converting the plane 's storage compartment into a quite unplanned fire chamber . Great corporations can also be injured when their computerizedpositive control systems break down . Black rememberedthe consternation a few years back when Fortune had demonstrated this point about General Dynamics . The Convair 990 was a 200 million-dollar demonstration of the fallibility of computerized simulation . Convair designed a drawing-board airplane that checked out to be the fastest commercial jet in the computer " flight tests , " so they decided to save money , skip the costly prototype stage , and go directly into production . Only the 990 did n't perform as designed . Nobody knew why , and the enigmatic computers that had been so reassuring could not be charged with malfeasance . THE BRIEFING 161General Black also knew that Groteschele was sliding past another important factor . Each machine had to be adjusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their training , suffered from fatigue and boredom . Many was the time that General Black had seen a tired and irritated mechanic turn a screwdriver a half turn too far , fail to make one last check , ignore a negative reading on a testing instrument . On a plane , such errors would mean only that an expensive piece of machineryand a few men would be lost . On a Fail-Safe black box  --  and the men who adjusted and installed them had not the remotest notion of what they were  --  the slightest accident could trigger the final disaster . Black glanced around the table . Stark was watching the strategy board . New blips had just appeared and Stark was toying nervously with his pencil as he followed their progress . Black looked at Wilcox . He sensed that Wilcox was mentally rejecting the possibility of accidental war . It depressed Black , and he felt that he should do more , but he knew he could not . Groteschele 's patronizing voice reached back into Black 's consciousness . Now the voice was talking about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " problem , it was saying . " Suppose the Russians caused an accident , " suggested Groteschele . " Suppose it were a true accident . Suppose it was a 50-megaton missile aimed for New York or Washington , what could be done ? How could we really know it was an accident ? How could they prove it ? Would it make any differenceif they could ? Even if we believed it to be an accident , should we not retaliate with everything we had ? " Good questions , Black agreed , but no answers were offered . It did n't seem to be a real discussion about real problems . Black remembered the flurry of excitement a few years before when some scholar had published a paper on the strategy of surrender . The argument had been simple . If either side strikes162 FAIL-SAFEfirst , is not surrender the only possible strategy for the other side ? What is to be gained by retaliation ? There had been a series of Congressional hearings , and then no one heard any more about the strategy of surrender . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everyone was looking at the Big Board . The large alert signal at the top of the board had flashed on . The board still showed the blips Black had just seen Stark watching . The six blips were six bomber groups in the air almost at their Fail-Safe points . There was also an unidentified blip somewhere between Greenland and Canada . Black noted that the clock above the Big Board showed 10:28 . Groteschele paused to look around at the Big Board . He turned back to his audience , saying , " Well , we 're in luck . A nicely arranged alert for our discussion . You ca n't count on these for a Pentagonlecture any more . The equipment has become so much more accurate that they only occur about six times a month now . " Groteschele tried to recapture the attention of his audience by delving into an explanation of the need for maximum reactiontimes in evaluating an alert . Even though more and more ICBMs were becoming operational exery day , he explained , they would not be used immediately in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were too quick . They allowed too little time for thought and the detection of error . This had led to a return to manned bombers for a first-strike retaliation rather than immediate reliance on the newer long-range rockets . The bombers provided hours of revaluation and analysis , the rockets only thirty minutes . Besides , regardless of the outcome , even if the entire country were devastated the rockets could always be thrown in at the end . The Big Board was proving more seductive than Groteschele . His voice rose slightly . THE BRIEFING 163 " Now if the Soviets really have a high-level satellite which carries a rocket , then we are in danger , " he said and paused , his voice heavy . " Real danger . For then the reaction time would be down to fifty or sixty seconds . Not even enough time to call the President . " But Groteschele had lost his audience . All eyes remained glued on the Big Board . Soon the foreign unidentified blip would get identified , and fade off the board . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of birds , and so on . Then the SAC groups would veer off their lines of flight and disappear from the board . Yes , Black could see , it was happening now . The foreign unidentified blip was fading out . The room , which had grown quietly tense , now relaxed . Cigarettes were lit and pencils returned to doodling exercises as men tried to shed their nervousness in their private ways . Soon a messenger would come in with SPADATS ' explanation of what the blip had been . Then Groteschele could resume , happily monopolizingthe attention of his audience again . One by one , five SAC groups began in turn to veer off . Only one group was left on the board . Then as Black watched unbelievinglyit flew past its Fail-Safe point . He glanced at Stark . Stark was erect in his chair . Wilcox was oblivious of what had happened . Most of the other officers had turned back to Groteschele . Stark stared at Black . He raised his eyebrows . Black looked at Groteschele . What happened to Groteschele came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen correctly : Groteschele 's eyes glittered and he shuddered . To Black it seemed an expression composed of apprehension , excitement , delight , and opportunity . Then it was gone . Groteschelestood absolutely still , staring at the board . Black realized that only three men in the room fully understood what had just happened. 164 FAIL-SAFEThen the whole board went black . Apparently the operator did not think the action of Group 6 to be important . Maybe he had just not noticed it . Stark scribbled a note to Black . It said , " Ever see a group go past Fail-Safe before ? " Black shook his head . Stark started to get up from his chair . Black knew he was going to check with the tactical officers in another office . Stark froze halfway up . A phone had rung . It did not ring loud , but it did ring distinctively . A steady persistent unbroken ring . It was the red phone . None of the men in the room had heard it before . Wilcox was not aware of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around him . He came to rigid attention . An Army general ran across the room to the red phone . It did not look at all unseemly for a general to be dashing to answer a phone . In fact it seemed to be done in nightmarish slow motion . The general listened for a moment . He turned back to the room woodenly . Looking at Wilcox he said with excessive clarity : " Mr. Secretary , the President is calling from the White House bomb shelter . He wants to speak to the senior person present . That is you . I am directed to see that the Joint Chiefs and the Secretaries convene here immediately . " He laid the receiver beside the phone and dashed from the room . Wilcox stumbled around out of his chair and virtually fell toward the phone , stealing a look at the Big Board as he did so . The Big Board had lit up again . And now it projected just two things ; the Fail-Safe point of Group 6 and the blip of Group 6 . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11THE URGENT MINUTES1039 HOURS " There is nothing further to report , Mr. President , " General Bogan said . Colonel Cascio was staring straight at the Big Board . " Group 6 is about two hundred and sixty miles past Fail-Safe and continuing on what is apparently an attack course . " " Do you know what happened to them ? " the President 's voice asked . " No , sir , we do not , " General Bogan said . " There is a chance , an outside chance , that they made a navigational error and will swing back . " " Have they ever made a navigational error that big before ? " the President asked crisply . " No , sir , " General Bogan said . " But when you 're traveling over 1,500 miles an hour , a little error can throw you a long distance off . " 165166 FAIL-SAFE " Let 's rule that one out , " the President said . " Why have n't you been able to raise them yet by radio ? " " We do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " We have tried them on all frequencies and ca n't make contact . " " Why ? " the President broke in , his voice impatient . " First , there might be natural meteorological disturbances , and our weather people say there is a big electrical storm just behind the Vindicators , " General Bogan said . " Secondly , the Russians might be jamming our radio reception " Why the hell would they do that ? " the President asked . " I do n't know , " General Bogan said , paused , and then went on . He spoke slowly , his voice unconvincing . " There is a remote possibility that their Fail-Safe black boxes might be giving them a go ' signal and that Russian jamming is prevent- ing our verbal Positive Control system from operating . " " Is that possible ? " the President said sharply . General Bogan paused . Then his voice gained confidence . " No , Mr. President , the odds against both systems failing at the same time are so high I think that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Colonel Cascio was watching him . He felt an undefined and nagging discomfort . " Almost impossible . " " All right , " the President said . " Now if we do regain radio contact will they respond to a direct order from me to return ? " " They will answer , sir , " General Bogan said , " providing we can reach them by radio within the next five minutes . " Then he paused . " However , if after that time their black boxes still tell them to go ' they are under orders not to turn back even if someone who sounds like you orders them back . You can see the reason for that . The enemy could easily abort a real attack just by having someone around who could make a good imita- Lion of your voice . Those people in the Vindicators have to THE URGENT MINUTES 167obey the Fail-Safe mechanism . They ca n't rely on voice trans-missions . " Something like a sigh came over the speaker . " All right , let me sum up , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us Group 6 has flown past its Fail-Safe point and right now seems to be on an attack course toward Russia . We ca n't raise them by radio , but there 's an outside chance that we may later . What is their target ? " " Moscow , " General Bogan said bluntly . " Holy Mary , Mother of God , " the President said in a low and very slow voice . He said it again , as if to shake off a terrible reality . There was for a fleeting moment something of the acolyte , the altar boy , in his voice . When he spoke again , however , his tone was strong . " What is the next step ? " " If we follow standard operating procedure the next step would be to order the Skyscrapper fighter planes which are standing by at Vindicators Fail-Safe to attack them , " General Bogan said . Colonel Cascio 's head jerked sideways and he stared at General Bogan . " The fighters would first try to raise the bombers visually and divert them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with air-to-air missiles and cannon fire . " There was a long pause on the line . Then the President spoke . " Who gives that order , General ? " the President asked . " You do , sir , " General Bogan said . " General , order the fighters to start their pursuit of Group 6 , " the President said without a moment 's hesitation . " I assume that will take a few minutes at least . Tell them to hold fire until they get the direct order from me . I would like to delay the actual firing on the group until the last possible moment . " Bogan and Cascio heard the click of the President putting down the phone without waiting for an acknowledgment. 168 FAIL-SAFE 1041 HOURS THE PENTAGON Swenson had come into the Big Board room . He was accom- panied by two of his aides . They were both tall men and they emphasized his slightness . Swenson stood at the door for a moment and looked at the people in the room . They had all come to attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Swenson made his count , nodded , and they all sat down . He walked to the chair at the head of the table , and as he reached it the red phone , which had been moved directly in front of him , rang . As he leaned forward to pick up the phone Swenson looked casually at the Big Board . He seemed little in the chair  --  little and very con- fident and orderly . His presence eased the tension in the room . " Yes , Mr. President , " Swenson said . It was possible to link the red phone to a loudspeaker so that everyone in the room could hear it . Swenson chose not to do that . " Mr. Secretary , General Bogan at Omaha has told me that he recommends that we order our fighter planes accompanying Group 6 to shoot them down , " the President said . This was not precisely the truth and the President knew it . However , he wanted Swenson to face the decision most abruptly and nakedly . " The decision is mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . " " Mr. President , do you want me to discuss this with them right now or shall we call you back ? " Swenson said . He was glad he had not put the conversation on the loudspeaker . In Swenson 's methodical mind was stored the fact that shooting down the bombers was standard operating procedure . By phrasing the problem this way the President was forcing them to make an evaluation rather than follow a set procedure . THE URGENT MINUTES 169 " I will hold the line for your opinion , " the President said . " General Bogan at Omaha has recommended to the Presidentthat our fighters be ordered to shoot down Group 6 , " Swensonsaid in a calm voice . " The President is awaiting our advice before giving that order . Gentlemen , what do you have to say ? " Of the men at the table only Swenson and Black knew that this was standard operating procedure . Of the rest of the group Wilcox was the most shocked . His face flushed . " Jesus Christ , order Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It would . . . it is indecent . I 'm against it . " Swenson 's eyes were veiled . He looked around the table . Groteschele 's hand went up . " Mr. Secretary , I oppose it on the grounds that it is premature , " Groteschele said levelly . He wanted to overcome Wilcox 's apparent hysteria . " After all , sir , our planes have not yet reached Soviet air space . In fact , they are hundreds of miles away from it . " Swenson 's face was still impassive ; he might have been the presiding officer at a small Midwestern corporation 's board of management meeting . " We must do it and at once , " Black said flatly . " First , if we do not give the order now the fighters may not be able to overtake the Vindicators . Secondly , if we delay the order we lose any bargaining position that we might need later with the Russians . They are watching Group 6 and our fighters right now and are trying to guess what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other steps after this and they involve much more than the crews of six bombers . A lot may hinge on the Russians believing what we tell them . You can be damned sure that the moment those planes penetrate Soviet air space the President is going to be in a tough spot talking with the170 FAIL-SAFE THE URGENT MINUTES 171Russians and will need everything he can get to bargain with them . " Another point occurred to Black : if only one fighter made it and brought down one bomber perhaps the others would turn back  --  but he did not really believe it . He knew that the Vindicators would bore in even if they had to do it singly . They had been too well trained to panic at the sight of a single bomber exploding . They had also been steeled to the possibility that enemy planes , simulated to look like American planes , might make an attack . Swenson 's eyes opened fully ; they were bright and attentive . He glanced quickly around the rest of the men at the table . There appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had summed it up . Swenson knew that some of the others did n't agree , but sensed that Black had the logic and the facts . He admired Black 's cool presentation and sensed that the President would be thinking in much the same way . " Mr. President , it is our belief that it is a tactical decision , but it is our unanimous view that the fighters should be ordered in , " Swenson said , looking directly at Wilcox . Swenson put the phone back in its cradle . Wilcox 's face was a mottled pink. 1042 HOURSTHE WHITE HOUSEBuck had heard all of the conversations . He stared at the President . The President had one leg thrown over the arm of his chair and occasionally he puffed at a long thin cigar . His posture was reassuring to Buck . Everything that Buck had heard on the telephone had tightened his stomach muscles and only the President 's physical ease kept Buck from trembling . " Get Omaha again , " the President said into the phone . Almost instantly they were through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Bogan 's voice said . " General , order the fighters in , " the President said . " Let me confirm that , " a strange voice said on the circuit . " This is Colonel Cascio , General Bogan 's assistant . Do you want the fighters to press home the attack even if they have to go to afterburners ? That will nearly triple their consumptionof fuel and almost certainly mean that none of then will be able to make it back . " The voice paused , then spoke with more firmness , almost a tough arrogance . " Mr. President , those fighters are America 's first line of defense against a Russian attack . In putting them on afterburners to chase our own bombers we will be sacrificing our fighters ' defensive capability at the very time we may need it most  --  the Russians may attack at any moment now . " The President paused . Buck watched him scribble some words on his pad . They said , " Sacrifice fighters convince Russiansan accident ? Give up defensive capacity of fighters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I repeat the order , " the President said , coldly . " Mr. President , the fighters swung away from the Vindicatorswhen they got the all clear , " General Bogan said . " In effect , the Vindicators and the Skyscrappers have been flying in oppositedirections for some minutes . The Skyscrappers have only a slight edge of speed over the Vindicators . There is some doubt that they can overtake the Vindicators . " " I repeat , General Bogan , that the fighters are to overtake and shoot down the Vindicators even if it means going to afterburners , " the President said. 172 FAIL-SAFE THE URGENT MINUTES 1731044 HOURSOMAHA " Colonel Cascio , order the fighters to attack Group 6 , " General Bogan said as he put the phone down . Colonel Cascio came halfway out of the chair in a spasm of protest . " That means that you have decided our bombers are makingan accidental strike on Moscow ? " Colonel Cascio asked . His voice was shocked , but there was also a hard underlay of rebellion . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said savagely . " The machines , the men , the diplomats , the President , all of us . Why the hell do you think we have fighter planes following the Vindicators ? Just to protect them if they go ' ? Do n't be silly . We always knew that one of their tasks was to shoot down the Vindicators if there was a mistake . All right , there has been a mistake . Get on the horn to the fighters , Colonel . " Colonel Cascio lifted his hand . It was a peculiar gesture . It was partly a plea for time , partly as if he were warding off some grotesque thing , partly the gesture a child makes when threatened . " General , the fighters  --  " " Colonel , get on that horn and give the order , " General Bogan said . " Every second you delay takes them further away from the Vindicators . " Colonel Cascio began to move the levers and buttons that would put him in direct voice communication with the fighters . But even as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch the bombers , General , which is n't likely , they wo n't have enough fuel to get back , " Colonel Cascio said . " They 'll go down in the ocean or on enemy territory . " A voice came up on the War Room intercom . It was the officer in charge of Fighter Direction . " General Bogan , we are in voice communication with Tangle-Able-1 , " the voice said . " You can talk to them on Channel 7 . Single Side Band . " General Bogan nodded and Colonel Cascio lifted a lever . Instantly there was the blurred static-heavy sound of longdistanceradio transmission . " Do I tell them in code or clear language ? " Colonel Cascioasked . " Clear language , " General Bogan said . " That is stand-ard . " Colonel Cascio knew this . It had been hammered out after months of discussion that if a situation arose in which our own fighters must shoot down our own planes there would be no disadvantage and , possibly , some advantage in having the enemy hear the transmission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice said through the static . " I read you five by five at last transmission . " Colonel Cascio bent forward and spoke into a microphone , his voice only slightly thin and weak . " Tangle-Able-1 , this is Colonel Cascio on the Omaha staff . " Sweat now stood out on his forehead . " Group 6 has flown through the Fail-Safe point and is on an attack course towards Moscow . It is a mistake . I repeat : it is a mistake . Go to afterburners and overtake and attack Group 6 . " There was a moment 's silence . Then the young voice came back loud and clear . " Roger . Go to afterburners and overtake and attack Group 6 , " the voice said . Colonel Cascio leaned forward and switched the lever off . To General Bogan , watching , Colonel Cascio 's posture was that of a child crying soundlessly. 174 FAIL-SAFE THE URGENT MINUTES 1751044 HOURSTHE SKYSCRAPPERSThe lead plane of the six Skyscrappers made a long sweeping turn . The voice of the captain in charge of the flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be heard only by the six planes in the flight . " I do n't know what those mother-grabbers back in Omaha are doing , but you all heard the order , " the captain said . " We overtake and shoot down the Vindicators . " " That will be the day , " a twenty-one-year-old pilot of one of the fighters said . " Us with a 50-mile-an-hour edge on the Vindicators and those bastards halfway to Moscow already . " " By SOP they will divert a KC-135 to refuel us , " another voice said sweetly . " It does 560 an hour , we do 1600 . By the time we run out of fuel they 'll be about a thousand miles away . Everything is beautifully organized . " " Do n't knock the staff people , " a voice said mockingly . " After you run out of fuel you make a thousand-mile glide back to the tankers . Any flier worth his salt should be able to do that in a Skyscrapper . " Someone laughed briefly . They knew that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop like a stone as soon as it lost power . None of the six pilots thought they would overtake the Vindicators . They knew they would not be able to fly their fighters back to their bases . If they thought of anything they thought of two things . First , would the ejection capsule and parachute really operate at 1600 miles an hour ? Second , how long could a man live in arctic waters ? " Cut the chatter , " the captain in command said . " On the mark , go to afterburners . " The captain counted from five down to one and then saidquietly , " Mark . " Six fingers shifted six levers . Against the six young and doomed bodies the seat-backs slammed relentlessly . From a hundred tubes toward the end of the jet engines raw fuel poured into the hot flames of the exhaust . The planes trembled under the instantaneous acceleration and then steadied down to the chase. 1044 HOURSTHE VINDICATORSLieutenant Colonel Grady looked out and down . In front of the Vindicators the surface of the Pacific was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at all like water , but like thickened darkness . Grady felt motelike , tiny , pushed by the great expanding aura of light behind him . He wished , in a quick irrational flash , that the sun would hold . To fly in darkness seemed protective . Grady glanced quickly at the other two men in the Vindicator . They were intent on their instruments . Suddenly Grady envied them their innocence with a remorse so great that it was close to hatred. 1045 HOURSTHE WHITE HOUSE " Get the Pentagon back again , " the President said . The President 's leg was still tossed over the arm of the chair , his cigar had developed only a small ash . Swenson came up on the telephone . " Mr. Secretary , if our fighters shoot down the Vindicators it will be tragic , but the big problem will be over , " the President said . " I would like your people to be thinking about what we do if the fighters can not shoot down the bombers . " 12WORDS , STATISTICS , AND OPINIONSSwenson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether or not to turn the Big Board off , but decided to leave it on as a reminder of the urgency of the situation . The problemwas to get the fullest possible answers to the questions in the least amount of time . " Gentlemen , Omaha is plugged in with us and General Bogan and Colonel Cascio are listening in at that end , " Swensonsaid . " Mr. Knapp , the president of Universal Electronics , and Congressman Raskob are also at Omaha on a visit . I have given them permission to listen to our discussion and to commentif they have something to say . " Swenson 's voice had been almost excessively calm . Now when he spoke again , there was in his voice the sharp metallic ring of urgency . " In a very short time the President will be back to us and he will want answers to some questions , " Swenson said . " First , what happened ? Secondly , what to do if the fighters cannot177178 FAIL-SAFEovertake the Vindicators ? Thirdly , what are the Russians going to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it ? The discussionwill be only on these points . " Swenson glanced around the table . His eyes stopped when they came to Black . Black 's unblinking eyes , deep-sunken , almost invisible , looked steadily at him . " General Black , will you very quickly bring us up to date on what has happened , " Swenson said . " Mr. Secretary , the first thing to face is the fact that we are flying blind , " Black said . " No one knows exactly what has happened . All we know for sure is that SAC Group No. 6 flew through its Fail-Safe point and , unless stopped , will attempt to make an attack on Moscow . Basically only two things could have happened : a compound mechanical failure or someone in Group 6 has gone berserk . " " Statistically a double mechanical failure is almost impossible , " Groteschele growled . " But it is conceivable , is it not ? " Swenson asked the question so sharply that Black wondered if somehow he had been briefed on the earlier discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but . . . , " Groteschele said , but stopped when Swenson swung his head away . Bogan 's voice boomed over the loudspeaker . Somewhere a technician adjusted the volume and it seemed almost as if Bogan were in the room . " I agree with General Black , but Colonel Cascio has a doubt , " General Bogan said . " Very briefly his argument is that the Russians have devised a way to mask the real position of Group 6 , which is probably flying back toward the States . What we read as Group 6 on the radar is actually a group of Soviet bombers up there for precisely one reason  --  to lead us to believe that we have accidentally launched a bomber group atWORDS , STATISTICS , AND OPINIONS 179Russia . I disagree with this analysis . But it should be con-sidered . " Around the table there were multiple signs of restlessness . Groteschele scratched on a pad of paper . Others reached for cigarettes . Stark looked down the table at Black . Black remainedimpassive , but he tensed for Swenson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Cascio . " Thank you , General Bogan , " Swenson said , without taking his eyes from Black 's face . " I agree with your evaluation of Colonel Cascio 's argument . Now , General Black , will you continue ? " " Every surveillance device we have has been thrown on the Russians , " Black said . " They have seven bomber groups in the air at this moment . None of these can reach America without refueling . None of them is flying an attack course . All are following hold patterns inside Soviet control borders . An abnormallylarge number of Russian fighters are in the air , in fact approximately half of their fighters are airborne . However , a simultaneous computer analysis of their flight patterns does not reveal a definite aggressive pattern . The Russians have launched no rockets as yet . Our devices which pick up sudden discharges of energy are probably our most reliable surveillanceinstruments . I am confident that the Soviets have not used their ICBMs as yet . " " What do you make of it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it short . " " They have the same problem with our Group 6 as we had earlier with the UFO , " Allen of the National Security Council said . It was the first time he had spoken . " They do n't know what it is , why it is there , or even if it is ours . " " The best answer happens also to be the simplest , " Black said calmly . " The Russians probably picked up the same unidentifiedobject we did . They understood why our
