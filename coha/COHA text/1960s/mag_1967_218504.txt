Two weeks ago , Premier Nguyen Cao Ky declared his candidacy for the presidency of South Viet Nam . His only reservation in standing for the Sept. 3 elections , he said , was that he would " never " oppose his colleague in the ruling military directorate , General Nguyen Van Thieu , should Chief of State Thieu decide to run . Though both officers had wanted a single " military " candidate to avoid splitting the army 's loyalties in the balloting , both also want the presidency badly . So last week Thieu called Ky 's bluff . He announced that he , too , would run , although it would be two or three weeks before he formally threw his hat in the ring . That left both Ky and Thieu the choice of withdrawing or deciding to do battle in a campaign for the presidency that could split the country .
