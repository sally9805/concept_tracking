From the steep stone bleachers of Manhattan 's Lewisohn Stadium , the skinny conductor who walked onto the outdoor stage last week seemed miles away . But once he began conducting , Seiji Ozawa caught every eye . As exhilarating as the final accelerando of Tchaikovsky 's Fourth Symphony were the dancelike body movements with which Ozawa conducted it . His expressive left hand seemed everywhere , searching out the lyrical underpinnings of Borodin 's Second . He found them , and New York critics unanimously agreed that musically little Seiji was a giant in the making . <P> Ozawa , 27 , is already a conductor honored in many lands , but not in his own . He left Japan four years ago , successively won first place ( and 100,000 francs ) in the Concours International de Jeunes Chefs d'Orchestre , the Koussevitzky Memorial Scholarship for the best young conductor at Tanglewood , and a place at the side of Leonard Bernstein as an assistant conductor of the New York Philharmonic . <P> Only in Tokyo did the rising young conductor fall flat . He returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan 's prestigious NHK ( Japanese Broadcasting Corp . ) Orchestra to a six-month , $10,000 contract . Proudly , he got up on the podium to display the sweeping conducting technique reminiscent of Bernstein . But his imported hip-swinging was wasted on the musicians of the NHK . For 36 years they had served Germanic masters , who stylistically frown on conducting exertions more noticeable than an occasional swing of the index finger . The sight of the flailing young conductor reminded a critic of " a samurai warrior leading his men to battle . " Soon the NHK ranks were brewing a mutiny . When the musicians said " Ozawa 's full of air and showmanship , but little that 's real art , " he demanded apologies . Instead , he got fired . Refusing to believe his bad luck , Ozawa went to the concert hall anyway and , alone and forlorn , awaited his orchestra . It never turned up . <P> Ever since , poor Seiji has believed that all 5 ft. 6 in. and 125 Ibs. of him is somehow not enough to command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day in an effort to build a stocky German silhouette , to no avail . " It would be ideal to be older and German , " he mused . " But can I help being young and thin and Japanese ? " <P> New York has been willing to overlook his silhouette . The Philharmonic has signed Ozawa as an assistant conductor for a month-long tour of the U.S. Before heading for the Hollywood Bowl next month , he has a guest slot to fill conducting the orchestra of The Hague . In the fall , Ozawa will be one of the first guest conductors of the Montreal Symphony at the new Place des Arts . Before each concert he eats rice and Japanese vegetables , lest he lose weight and look even younger . " On your beefsteak I lose my appetite , " he worries . " I would grow thinner .
