txt Baraboo , Wis. , Oct. 14-Mrs . Mayme Ward , 71 , is a grandmother with a gentle laugh and a jar full of cookies for the neighborhood youngsters who make her house a hangout . Yet it 's hard to think of her as Gramps , which is what her granddaughter , Robin , 11 , calls her . Perhaps that 's because she used to " fly " with the circus . In her circus days , Mrs. Ward was billed as the only woman in the world to do a double somersault from the flying trapeze while blindfolded and wearing a hood over her head . But Gramps is rather casual and offhand about it now . Silly to Do It " I was silly enough to do it , " she said . " But I 'm too old to do that stuff anymore . " Once in a while , tho , she 'll do a handstand to amuse the youngsters who come to eat her cookies . " But that 's nothing , " she hastens to say . You may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuses ?

She and her late husband , Edward , performed with a group of nine aerialists known as the " Flying Wards . " Began at Age 10 Mrs. Ward started her circus career at the age of 10 . She laughs when she tells how she decided to stop " flying " at age 52 . " My son said , ' You 'd better get down out of there , Ma . Nobody wants to see an old bag like you . ' So I quit . " Today Mrs. Ward lives in a modest frame home on a quiet tree shaded street across the Baraboo river from the Circus World museum here . In front of her house is parked one of the museum 's big red circus wagons with the words " wardrobe superintendent " printed on it in white letters . The wagon is loaded with gay , colorful costumes for clowns , show girls , musicians , and horseback riders . Mrs. Ward makes them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pachyderms . She spends a whole year cutting and sewing the costumes , which are used in the annual Fourth of July circus parade in Milwaukee . Sally Rand Designer Since she retired as a performer , said Mrs. Ward , she has made all kinds of costumes from elephant blankets to Gstrings . Once she was a costume maker for Sally Rand . That was in 1939 during the World 's fair in San Francisco . A friend called to say Miss Rand needed a costume maker , and this perplexed Mrs. Ward . " I said , ' What kind of a costume can you make for Sally Rand ? " she related . " Turned out she wanted some cowgirl outfits for her chorus girls . " She might as well have worn a costume , the way she worked in that dim blue light and manipulated her fans . Nobody ever got to see anything .

I said , ' U , shut up , Sally , birds take a bath , do n't they . " Elephants , Mrs. Ward said , e like women . They have so many odd shapes . That 's why elephant blankets give her the most trouble in her costume making . " Next time you see a bunch Mayme Ward of elephants , look at them and you 'll see no two are alike , " she said . " Some are broad across the rear , some have long legs , some short legs , some are sloping and narrow , and some are short and fat like me . " Mrs. Ward has traveled all over the country , but she likes living in small towns . ' " I used to miss the circus , " she said , " but not any more .
