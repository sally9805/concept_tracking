txt White-ruled Rhodesia has threatened to declare its independence from Britain soon . Zambia and Malawi , formerly parts of the Rhodesian federation , shaded above , already are independent and governed by black Africans . Meanwhile , London announced this week its black-ruled protectorate of Bechuanaland ( heavy stripes ) would be given its full independence next September . Salisbury , Rhodesia The mood of Rhodesia is one of resolution . No longer is it a question of whether there will be a unilateral declaration of independence ( UDI ) but when . For the most part the temper of the white people is equivocal . If anything , the average European appears to be ahead of his government in demanding prompt action . Here and there a note of caution is heard . The press and certain business organizations warn about economic and international " consequences .

In all the stir over independence , only silence is " heard " from the mass of the people of Rhodesia  --  its four million Africans .

African nationalists hold on the contrary that the chiefs , as " paid agents " of the regime , represent no one , and that the vast bulk of Africans are behind the drive for " majority rule . " Nationalists are basing their hopes on the belief that with a UDI Africans will rise violently against the white regime . If fighting breaks out , then some form of international intervention might result in forcing the pace of majority rule .
