Even in the day of ever-rising academic standards and ever-brighter freshman classes , it is still possible for students to earn a credit or two without really trying . Despite the best efforts of administrators to stamp them out , U.S. universities still have their share of " micks " ( Mickey Mouse courses ) , " snaps , " " guts " or " roaring guts . " <P> Once in a while , the guts are tacitly tolerated by the school to preserve the eligibility of dim-witted athletes . Many more , however , simply reflect the good intentions of such kindly professors as Stanford Political Scientist James T. Watkins IV , who rarely awards anything less than an A on the lovable notion that " There is too much tension in the university-I do n't want to add to the general insecurity and unhappiness of the community .
