txt The Congress of Racial Equality suspended its Brooklyn chapter yesterday for refusing to give up plans for a gigantic traffic jam at the World 's Fair opening April 22 . James Farmer , CORE 's national director , charged that the flamboyant tactics of the Brooklyn group were in conflict with protests being prepared by other chapters under the guidance of the national ' organization . Those plans are to be announced today . In a telegram , Mr. Farmer ordered the officers of the Brooklyn chapter to make no public statements before a meeting of all the local chapters at the national office this afternoon . The meeting could bring the expulsion of the Brooklyn chapter . Defying Mr. Farmer , the officers of the Brooklyn chapter held a news conference in their storefront office in the Bedford-Stuyvcsant section . Sufficient Support Seen They insisted that they were going ahead with their plans and contended that they had already enlisted enough persons , with ears to snarl fair-bound traffic . The plan , which is beling called a " stall-in , " is for the cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fairgrounds . The suspension put the national organization in the uncomfortable position of disciplining one of its most militant chapters . It created confusion among the local chapters here , none of which issued statements supporting Mr. Farmer . However , one local chapter , New York CORE ( Harlem ) voted unanimously last night to protest what it called " the Hegel suspension of Brooklyn CORE because Brooklyn CORE has not violated any of the rules for action , or the national constitution . " In recent months , Brooklyn CORE has often seemed closer to the Rev. Dr. Milton A. Calamison and his Citywide Com CORE Suspends Brooklyn Wing For Urging Traffic Jam at Fair // mittee for Integrated Schools than to its own national leaders . Though the national organization withheld support from the second school boycott , Brooklyn CORE actively supported it . In all , 9 of the 14 local chapters stood behind Dr. Galamison . Last Saturday , members of the Bronx and Brooklyn chapters joined Dr. Galamison in a demonstration at one of the entrances to the World 's Fair . Thirty demonstrators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Galamison was not in the city yesterday . But Mrs. Thelma Johnson , the executive secretary of his committee , predicted that other CORE chapters would soon " find themselves in trouble with the mother house . " " Can CORE continue to exist in New York by cutting off its branches ? " she asked . Yesterday Mr. Farmer was in Cleveland , where racial tensions have been deepening since the accidental killing of a local CORE officer  --  a white minister ? in a civil rights demonstra tion Monday . Reached there by phone , Mr. Farmer said that the Brooklyn chapter 's " stall-in " would " merely create confusion and thus damage the fight for freedom . " " We 're not splitting with them , " he insisted . " They 're splitting with us . " The traffic snarl , he said , ) would not only make it impos sible for people to reach the fair , but would also make it impossible for them to see the demonstrations other CORE chapters plan to stage there . Says He Warned Unit Tuesday evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and voted down Brooklyn CORE 's scheme . The national director said that he then warned the officers of the Brooklyn chapter that the demonstration would violate the organization 's bylaws , which forbids chapters to stage demonstrations that conflict with protests of other CORE groups . An officer of Brooklyn CORE , Arnold Goldwag , said that he did n't know what was in the bylaws or who had drafted them . His group , he mid , favored any and all protests planned for the opening day of the fair . On the wall of the chapter 's office was this sign : " D-Day minus 12 . " It was ironically similar to signs at the fair , which were proclaiming yesterday that there were only 12 days to go to the opening April 22 . Of the dozen or so Brooklyn chapter members milling about the office on Nostrand Avenue , none appeared to be as old as 30 . Despite Mr. Farmer 's interdiction , they were in a cheerful mood . Listening to a radio newscast , ! they learned that Roy Wilkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adanvement of Colored People ; had described the " stall-in " as " strictly Brooklynese . " " Oh , you 're so right , baby ! " one of the members shouted back at the radio amid raucous laughter . The laughter was repeated when the announcer reported on a statement by Police Commissioner Michael J. Murphy . The commissioner had insisted that he had the force and the equipment to keep the highways to the fair clear . " We intend to protect the constitutional rights of all men to peacefully assemble and petition , " Mr. Murphy said . " We also intend to protect the constitutional rights of all men to the pursuit of happiness . The World 's Fair should be a happy occasion in a somewhat far from happy world . No unlawful acts by any groups will be allowed to mar it . " Opportunity for Protests The fair is doubly attractive to civil rights groups as a setting for their protests . First , they believe that as a monument to American affluence it gives then the opportunity to declare that the . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And second , because it is ' an international show , they see , a chance to dramatize to the colored people of the world the degradation of the American , , Negro in his own country . To the civil rights groups , the protests of the fair corporation , that it does not discriminate are irrelevant . There is discrimination in Maryland , they say . Therefore , it is fitting that the Maryland Pavilion be picketed . Mr. Farmer said that the demonstrations planned by national PORE would also be aimed at the pavilions of companies that do not give Negroes equal opportunities . The organization will he ready to negotiate agreements on employment rights with these companies , he said . Mr. Farmer said that the national organization had suspended chapters before  --  though never in the New York area . Constitutionally , the organization is a federation of autonomous units . The Brooklyn chapter reports a membership of 300 . In calling the " stall-in " idea " Brooklynese , " Mr. Wilkins offered this recollection : " Brooklyn had a baseball team which innovated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time . "
