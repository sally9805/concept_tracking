The African porters , hired by white traders , who first labored their way 300 miles upstream on the Zambezi River called the spot Kebrabasa - " where the work ends . " A huge gorge through which the Zambezi flows in the western panhandle of Mozambique , Kebrabasa has always been a dead end . There , according to legend , Dr. Livingstone turned around his wheezing paddle steamer MaRobert in 1858 , musing that mastering the forbidding rocks would open wide the gates that have barred for centuries the interior of Portugal 's second largest overseas possession . <P> Now Portugal has set out to unlock that interior . It plans to build at Kebrabasa a 510-ft. - high , 1,000-ft-wide dam that by 1974 will generate 12 billion kw-h of electricity per year , 2 billion more than Egypt 's Aswan High Dam . Eventually , the dam will become a sort of common-market grid for white-dominated southern Africa . Most of the power will travel 800-mile-long lines to Pretoria and feed South Africa 's industry , but Mozambique 's other neighbors , Rhodesia and probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million contract for construction of the dam has been awarded to an international consortium led by the Oppenheimer 's huge Anglo American Corp . of South Africa . The group also includes Siemens and Telefunken of West Germany , Compagnie de Constructions Internationales of France , plus Swedish and South African firms. * Financing will be entirely through foreign credits and loans arranged by the consortium . Part of the money will be spent on a new seaport at Cuama , on the Indian Ocean at the mouth of the Zambezi , which will be capable of handling 40,000-ton freighters . More millions will go toward making the river navigable as far as Tete , some 90 miles from the dam . One day the Portuguese hope to see a huge iron and steel works rise on their modest 400-year-old settlement there . <P> Mozambique itself will absorb a growing amount of electric power : the dam will be the cornerstone of a vast development scheme designed to transform the wilderness , which is infested with tsetse flies and mosquitoes , into what the Portuguese like to think will become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are known reserves of nickel , copper and asbestos , plus a twelve-mile-long seam of coal and iron deposits that could produce an annual 1,000,000 tons of ore . <P> <P> * Losers in the bidding : a group led by the U.S. 's Morrison-Knudsen Co. and another formed around British companies , including English Electric Co.
