on the view and so receded further and further from some fire on the horizon : thus came each instant nearer to the murmur one hears in the tunnel which leads to death . Women must murder us unless we possess them altogether ( so said the luminous logic of this liquor in my hand ) and I had a fear now of the singer on the stand , for her face , yes , perhaps I could possess that altogether , perhaps that face could love me . But her bee-hind ! of course I could not possess that ass , no one ever had , maybe no one would , and so all the difficulty had gone down to her feet , yes the five painted toes talked of how bad this girl could be . So I saw her , that was the way I saw her : in a magic of spite , feeling as wicked as a titled child , I shot an arrow into her big toe , into the fat bullying certainty of that toe , and saw it twitch on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same spot and saw the foot retreat beneath her long skirt . Then , as if a curse were on me ( and so I must do the opposite of what I might intend ) whatever , from a motive 1 did not know ( I wished only to call back the move ) I shot one needle of an arrow into the center of Cherry 's womb , I felt it go in . I felt some damage lodge itself there . She almost lost her song . One note broke , the tempo shuddered , and she went on , turned to look at me then , a sickness came off her , something broken and dead from the liver , stale , used-up , it drifted in a pestilence of mood toward my table , sickened me as it settled in . And there was a touch of regret in that exhalation from her , as if she had been saving such illness in the hope she might inflict it on no one , that her pride would be to keep her own ills to herself , rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pierced her shield . Nausea was collecting in all my pipes . I went in a rush from the table to the men 's room , and in the stall , locked the door , knelt , and retched again for the second time that night , feeling as humble as a saint , I knew now that a saint would set his head near such a throne expecting the cleanest air to lay like a halo on the edge of the fumes . Perhaps I caught ap101hint of that air , for my burned-up lungs went clear  --  once again this night I was taking one of those fine new breaths I had not known in twenty years , so it seemed , and then I vomited with all the gusto of a horse on a gallop , cruds , violations , the rot and gas of compromise , the stink of old fears , mildew of discipline , all the biles of habit and the horrors of pretense  --  ah , here was the heart of the puke !  --  came thundering out with the fluid intent downrushing sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river , I felt like some gathering wind which drew sickness from the lungs and livers of others and passed them through me and up and out into the water . I was draining the poison from the wound I had inflicted in Cherry 's belly , and yes in confirmation her voice came rowdy-dah , rooty-toot , ringing through the men's-room walls , loud and laughing and triumphant , When the saints come marching in , soaring like a golden bird free at last from the cage of her throat , laughing happily at the antique of the song , and I held to the bowl and shook with sickness , and thought that if the murderer were now loose in me , well , so too was a saint of sorts , a minor saint no doubt , but free at last to absorb the ills of others and regurgitate them forth , ah yes , this was communion and shuddering rings of nausea and Leznicki , oh here came Leznicki , up from the belly , up , up , and the presence of Roberts up and splat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basement of my belly , the police were saying good-by to my body . Peace . And peace . Nausea faded like the echo of a locomotive in the gloom of that toilet stall , and I was lighting matches to search for specks and the hint of spatterings on my jacket , as if a more simple search in the light by the sink outside would be less devoted and so less effective . I washed my face in cold water , but carefully , once again carefully , as if I were washing a new face . And in the mirror my eyes were bright , bright and merry as the eyes of a yachtsman catching the sun off the water  --  was the mirror my sanity or helping to drive me mad ? Still I used it to comb my hair andp102reset my tie . The collar of my shirt was surprisingly fresh  --  I remembered the devotion with which I had put it on just after washing ( the corpse of Deborah lying of course flat on the floor in the other room ) and I wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift of life from the devotion I had given to the material then . Hierarchies of soul and spirit turned in my brain  --  drink , or a visitation from Deborah , had me insane as the Celts : I was trying to calculate how a shirt might have a spirit which laundriessmashed and tender fingers restored . Still , there was the evidence of the shirt . Ripped off to make love to Ruta , whipped on again , subjected to a grilling from the drilled eye of the police , and a walk in the rain , a psychic artillery battle in the bar , a round of heaves here , and still keeping its front !  --  my shirt must be as fortifiedas a superior ego . 1 had one wistful passing sadness that my mind would have the liberty to adventure no longer for would I be dead in three days ?  --  I seemed somehow to think this quite likely  --  or incarcerated ? or just deadened with the anxiety that questions and more intolerable questions were to be answered . And at this moment far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I thought , " you 're bitching me still . " But Cherry was finishing her set . Or that was the way the music felt as it came through the walls . Looking in the mirror I tipped my left hand to my left eye in a mock salute and the lights dimmed for an instant again as they had in the other bathroom , dimming now either in fact or in the center of my imagination , and I said to myself , " Yes , you certainly will be dead in three days . " Then I walked out and sat down at my table , just as she was finishingthe last few bars of " I 've Got You Under My Skin . " Which was just a little too late , for as she walked past me to the bar , a professional half smile on her face , her eye chose almost not to see me . " Let 's have a drink , " I said to her . " I 'm having a drink with some friends , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she gave a smile which was somewhat better , and walked over to the three men and two women I had decided earlier were Tony 's friends . She did not know the women , she went through some measured greeting with them , radar to radar , shaking hands finally with each of those two girls , and then she kissed two of the three men in a big wet friendly fashion like a smacking handshakeand being introduced to the third man , the former prizefighter , Ike Romalozzo , Ike " Romeo " Romalozzo was his name I remembered now , she hesitated , then said , " What the hell , " in a very loud very broad Southern accent and kissed Romeo for greeting to him as well . " You could charge five bucks for those kisses , " Romeo said . " Honey , it feels better to give them away . " " This girl 's a swinger , Sam , " said Romeo to one of the two other men , a short man , perhaps fifty-five , with gray hair , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This man now touched the head of the stone in the stickpin of his white tie as if to give warning . " She 's the friend of a friend , " said Sam . " Give us another kiss , sweetheart , " said Romeo . " I 'm still , " said Cherry , " recovering from the last one . " " Gary , where does her friend hide ? " Romeo asked . " Do n't ask , " said Gary . He was a tall heavy man about thirtyeightwith a long nose , a puffy face , and nostrils which cut the air with such an edge that his intelligence seemed to be concentrated there . Sam whispered in Romeo 's ear . Romeo was silent . Now they all were silent . Sitting where I was , not fifteen feet from the bar , I had come to the conclusion that if I were to be dead in three days , Romeo was the man who was likely to do the job . I had no idea if this thought came from what was most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply sodden with idiocies . Nonetheless , something now decided I must go up to Romeo in the next few minutes . " You 'll never get past the police , " said my mind to me , " unless you takep104the girl home from this bar . " And on the echo of this thought , I noticed the detectives were gone . I felt the anxiety of a man hearinghe must undergo a dangerous operation . " They 're going to make a movie of my life , " Romeo said to Cherry . " What are they going to call it ? " asked Gary , " Punchdrunk and Paunchy ? " " They 're going to call it the story of an American boy , " said Romeo . " Lover ! " said Sam . " The people I 'm with got a ghost writer working now . Story of a kid who goes bad , turns straight , goes bad again . " Romeo blinked his eyes . " It 's the fault of the company he keeps . Bad influences . Cheap whiskey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the price he pays . " Romeo was not bad-looking . He had curly black hair which he wore long and thick on the sides and he had had his nose bobbed once he retired from the ring . His eyes were dark and flat in expression , flat as Chinese eyes . He had put on weight . He would have looked like a young prosperous executive in Miami real estate if it had not been for the thick pads of cartilage on the sides of his temples which gave him a look of still wearing his headgear . " Who puts up the money for this movie ? " Cherry asked . " Couple of guys , " said Romeo . " Mutt and Jeff , " said Sam . " You do n't believe me ? " Romeo asked . " They ai n't going to make a movie of you , " Gary said . " If they get a good enough actor to play my part they going to make a very good movie , " said Romeo . " Say , Romeo , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said this from my seat fifteen feet away , but the words were out . I stood up and walked toward them . My idea was unfortunate , but it was the best I could muster . I kept hoping something better might reach my mind.  | " You , " said Romeo , " got an idea . " " Yes , " I said , " when they make your movie , I 'll play your part . " " You ca n't , " Romeo lisped , " you 're not sufficiently queer . " Romalozzo had been famous for his tricky left hook . I had just walked into it . A snicker began with Gary , passed on to Sam , reached Cherry and the two girls . They stood at the bar laughing at me . " I owe everybody a drink , " I said . " Bartender , " shouted Romeo , " five Bromo-Seltzers . " Gary slapped Sam on the back . " Our boy gets better and better . " " Talent is in its infancy , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the class , the fanciest broads in town will say , We had Romalozzo for dinner last night . ' " " Yeah , " said Sam , " and that Guinea ate all the pizza . " " Caviar foie . Hey , Frankie , " Romeo yelled to the bartender , " bring some caviar foie with the Bromo-Seltzer . " Cherry laughed again . She had an unusually large laugh . It would have been perfect and merry and a gain to anticipate if it had not been for a suspicion of something mulish and bragging , a bit of small-town Southern jackass in the sound . I realized what a tension had begun in me that she be perfect . " Romeo , " Cherry said , " you 're the funniest man I 've met today . " " It ai n't me , " said Romeo , " it 's my friend . My new friend . " He looked at me with his flat eyes . " Sam , is n't this my new friend ? " he asked . Sam looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's not my friend , " Sam said after a little pause . " Maybe he 's your friend , Gary ? " " Never saw the gentleman before , " Gary said . " Sweetie , " said Romeo to one of the girls , " is he yours ? " " No , but he 's cute , " said Sweetie . " Then , Honey , he must belong to you , " Romeo said to the other girl.  | " Not unless we met in Las Vegas five years ago . I think , " said Honey , trying to be helpful , " that we may have met at the Tropicana sometime like five or six years ago , do I care to count , ha ha . " " Shut up , " said Gary . The mulatto with the plump mandarin face and the goatee was staring at me from his table . I le looked like one of those jungle crows who sit high on a tree and watch the lions and the lion cubs take blood , foam and flesh from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Romeo , " he 's nobody 's friend . " " He 's yours , " said Sam . " Yes , " said Romeo . " 1 le 's mine . " He looked at me . " What do you say , pal ? " " You did n't ask the lady , " I said . " You mean the lady who was entertaining us ? The lady who was singing ? " I did n't answer . " Since you 're my friend , " said Romeo , " I 'll fill you in . This lady is my escort for the evening . " " I 'm surprised , " I said . " It 's a fact . " " I 'm really surprised , " I said . " Buddy , you played out your string , " said Romeo . " Now beat it . " " You could n't think of a more agreeable way to ask me to leave ? " " Move on . " I was ready to go . There was very little keeping me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of light in Cherry 's eyes , bright and prideful . That fed the anger to stare back into Romeo 's eyes . For she had been using me  --  so I understood it now . And felt an icy rage against all women who would use me . It was still another relative of insanity  --  I who had visited so many members of the clanp107tonight  --  but now I said , " I 'll move on when the lady asks me to move , and not before . " " The condemned man ate a hearty meal , " said Gary . I did not take my eyes from Romeo 's eyes . We locked one stare into the other . " You 're going to get hurt , " said his eyes . " I have something going for me , " said my eyes back . His expression turned dubious . The odds were not established for him . He had no ideas in his eyes , only pressure . Maybe he thought I had a gun . " You invite this guy over ? " asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cherry , " and you gave him one bitch of a greeting . " Romeo laughed . He laughed with a big flat dead sound at the center of his amusement , a professional laugh , the professional laugh of a fighter who has won a hundred fights and lost forty , and of those forty , twelve were on bad decisions , and six were fixed , and for four he went in the tank . So it was the laugh of a man who has learned how to laugh through all sorts of losses . " Say , " said Cherry , " this gentleman 's a celebrity . He 's Mr. Stephen Richards Rojack whose television program you are all familiar with , click ? " " Yeah , " said Sam . " Click , " said Gary . " Sure I know it , " said one of the girls , Sweetie , with the happiness of a dull pupil answering a quick question in class . " I 'm impressed to meet you , Mr. Rojack , " said Sweetie . She was sweet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And now since Mr. Rojack is very special to me , " said Cherry , putting one perfumed run of four fingertips on the back of my neck , " we 're going to go in the corner and have a few drinks . " " You 're on again in fifteen minutes , " said the bartender . " I did n't hear you , " said Cherry . She gave a silvery smile as if the terrors of men were about as admirable as the droppings of hippopotami.  |p108We  took a little table with a lamp shaped like a candle about ten feet from the isolated stand with its deserted piano and empty microphone . Sitting next to her , I seemed to feel not one presence in her , but two , an ash-blonde young lady of lavender shadows and curious ghosts , some private music , a woman with a body one might never be allowed to see in the sun ; and then the other girl , healthy as a farmer , born to be photographed in a bathing suit , brisk , practical , clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're still angry , " she said to me . " Yes . " " You did n't have to get mad , " she said . " They were just putting you on . " " So were you . If I had walked away , you 'd be here with Romeo . " " 1 might be . " " And feeling no different . " " That 's civil to say , " she said in a little Southern girl voice . " Evil says what evil sees . " I did n't know exactly what I was saying , but it pleased her immensely . We could have been adolescents . She flickered the backs of her fingers under my chin , her green eyes looking full of pepper in the glow of the candle , glints of brown and gold and yellow . In this light she was a pure cat , cat 's eyes , cat 's nostrils , cat 's knowing mouth . " Mr. Rojack , can you tell funny jokes ? " " Yes . " " Tell me one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " When ? " " When we 're about to leave . " " You 're rude . In fact ... " " Yes ? " " Ass , " she said with a Southern bray , and we beamed at each other like two jewelers finding a gem for a partner . Then we leanedp109forward and gave a kiss . With all that booze I came near to passing out . For a draft of something sweet and strong came off her mouth and spoke of what she knew , of small Southern towns and the back seats of cars , of expensive hotel suites and years of listening to good jazz , of simple honest muscle in her heart and the taste of good wines , jukeboxes and crap tables , stubborn will , something compromised , inert , and full of gas , something powerful and dull as her friends , the smell of bourbon , too , the raw red promise , so much I closed my eyes and fell back into a swoon for an instant or two , she was too much for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I 'd been sparring with a bigger man and got hit with a full right hand , not a bare fist but a hand in a boxing glove , and went out of consciousness for a second and took another slow second to come back because punishment was ahead . It was not the nicest kiss I ever had , but it was certainly the most powerful , there was something in it of the iron motor in the hearts of a good many men she must have kissed . " You 're such a sweet kisser , " she said . Yes , we could have been adolescents . I had not felt this peculiar mixture of promise and respect , a little awe ( as if I were walking blindfolded and might at any moment fall down a flight of stairs : but there were cushions at the bottom  --  part of the game ) , the expectationthat life had something to offer which few people knew anything about , the happiness that there was a body next to me which was feeling just about the sweet way I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a move . " Ass , " she said now , " you came over like you had a cricket in each pocket . " " I was scared . " " Of what ? " " Voodoo . " " You voodoo . You bongo nutty . I did n't introduce you because you were n't my friend no more . You were King Creep . "  | " I guess I was . " " Awful ! " The bartender came over . " It 's time for you to go on . " " Not singing any more tonight . " " I 'll have to call Tony , " he said . She had the expression on her face of a soldier who has found a fresh peach on an autumn tree and has stopped to eat it . In a minute he will begin to march again . " Call Tony , " she said , " and bring us two doubles . " " I do n't want to make a call to him . " " Frank , I wish you would call Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't . But do n't make me feel bad that I 'm making you feel bad . " Frank merely looked at her . " Besides , Mr. Rojack does n't like my singing . It makes him want to puke . " We all laughed . " He likes it , " said Frankie . " He gave me the evil eye every time I rattled a glass . " " Mr. Rojack is indiscriminate in his use of the evil eye , " said Cherry , " whoops ! " And the glass on which she was sipping flew out of her hand . " You 're really not going to sing , are you ? " asked Frank , looking at the broken glass on the floor . When she shook her head , he walked away . " Thanks a lot , Cherry , " he said . " Well , " said Cherry , " that breaks one beautiful mood . " She struck a match and blew it out . Then looked in the ashtray for a divination . " Bad turns ahead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , no . " She laughed happily . " You 're just spoiled . " We kissed again . It was within easy distance of the first kiss . Something might actually be waiting for us.  | " I think I 'm crazy . My wife is dead . I 've drawn a blank . " " Something wrong behind you and you do n't want to look ? " " Exactly . " " I 've been feeling that way for a week . " The accompanist , a Negro , went to the piano . As he went by Cherry , he shrugged . Then he picked out a moody chord , dropped onto two or three other moody chords , and went off into something fast and sulky . " Maybe you were in love with her , " said Cherry , " and that 's why you do n't get anything back . It 's the women who can hardly wait to be widows that scream at the funeral . " The phone was ringing . " Mr. Rojack , for you , " Frank called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As I passed , I noticed that Romeo Sam , Gary , the girls , all were gone . " Rojack ? " " Yes . " " Roberts . " " You still up ? " " Yes , buddy , I 'm still up . " " Where are you ? " " In Queens . I was just going to bed . " He paused with that righteous arrest of time which is common to authority . " Who 'd you get a call from ? " " Higher up . " " And what did they say ? " " Rojack , do n't give me any more of that upper-class zazz . I know where you were born . " " You do ? I do n't know where you were born . " " You son of a bitch , " said Roberts , " you 're loaded . " " Well , so are you , " I said . " You 're boozing . " " Yes . " " I thought you never drank . " " Once a year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your occasion . " " You upper-class finks , " said Roberts . " We 're very bad , " I said . " Listen , get out of the place you 're in , " said Roberts . " You 're not one hundred percent safe . " " I may not be safe , but I 'm certainly not suffering . " " That girl you 're with . " " Yes . " " Know who she is ? " " Poison . Pure poison . " " Better believe it , buddy . " " Roberts , it takes all kinds to make a world . " " Ever hear of Bugsy Siegel ? " " Of course I 've heard of Bugsy Siegel . Flow can you be a selfrespectingdrinker if you have n't heard of Bugsy Siegel ? " " Well , Rojack , the little girl you 're with now could have opened a school for Bugsy Siegel . " " Then , why , " I asked , " is she singing in an after-hours joint and making one hundred fifty a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Roberts . Now I was angry . " I thought you had to give your attention to Eddie Ganucci . " " Your case is taking some turns . " ' What do you mean ? " " You did n't tell us everything about your wife . " " Everything ? " " Either you know what I 'm talking about or you do n't . " " Obviously I do n't . " " Let it go . " " This new information  --  is it good or bad ? " " Come to the precinct at five-thirty this afternoon . " " That 's all you care to tell me ? " " I hear your father-in-law is flying into town this morning . "  | " Where did you hear that ? " " On the radio . " Roberts laughed . It was his first joke of the morning . " I heard it on the radio . Now , Rojack , give me the bartender . I want to talk to him . " When I got back to the table , Tony was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a man who has conflicting worries and is worrying over which one to worry first . He gave me a limp hand to shake and a flick of his eye . Hatred came off him like scent , dull and powerful , an essence of that taint I felt in Cherry the moment I came near to passing out . Standing near Tony , the full face of that hatred brought me close again to nausea ; there was menace and such little precision in the menace ( as if one were expiring inside a plastic sack ) that I felt a quick panic to quit them both , and held on where I was out of some instinct that the worst moment of suffocationmust always be the first . To Cherry I said with a smile , " Can you believe it ? The police think I ought to leave . " " Some police are intelligent people , " Tony said . " Still , they 're taking the best care of me . They were sufficiently worried to talk to your bartender after they spoke to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tony said . " Trouble comes in packages . Out on the street . " But he had another worried look on his face , as if he had five errands now and only three delivery boys . " It 's hard to trust anyone nowadays , " I said . " Friends , " he said . " Friends get tired . " This remark cost nothing . " All right , get up and do your set , " Tony said to Cherry . " I 'm not in the mood . " " I 'm not in the mood either . Do n't pull this on me . " She looked at my expression . " Do you have a funny story , Mr. Rojack ? " " I have a poem , " I said . ' Tell me. "  | " Witches have no wit , said the magician who was weak . " " Is that the first line of your poem ? " asked Cherry . " Yes . Want to hear the second ? " " Yes . " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hula , hula , said the witches . " She pealed with mirth as if a silver witch and a black witch were beating their wings at one another . " Repeat it , " she said . " Witches have no wit , said the magician who was weak . Hula , hula , said the witches . " She made me say it again while she memorized it . At the expression on Tony 's face , she gave a creamy smile . " You going to sing a set ? " he asked . " I 'll sing one song . " " What do you mean  --  one song ? " " Mr. Rojack 's poem put me in the mood , " she said . " I 'll sing one song or I wo n't sing anything . " " Go up , " he said . When she was on the stand , he turned and said to me , " She 'll do a whole set . " But Cherry was in consultation with the pianist . I could see him shake his head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While they parleyed , his fingers were nervously tapping out a riff on the keys , What 's that hear my baby say ? Funky-butt , funky-butt , take itaway . Cherry smiled at the microphone . " Funky-butt , funky-butt , take it away , " she murmured , and seemed to catch some electronic thread in the microphone for her sound came out breathy and then the microphone squealed . She put her hand to it , smiled at the dozen customers still left in the bar . " Time for breakfast , " she said . A patter of applause.  | " I know we 're all afraid to go out and look at that sun . " " It 's raining , " the judge with the two tarts called out . A few people guffawed . " Yes , your Honory , but the sun is shining in court , " said Cherry , which brought a slow ripple . " Yes , we 're all scared of breakfast , " said Cherry , " but I 'm going to sing one song . Then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only kidding , " said Tony . His voice was carefully wrapped , but it had the suppressed clangor of a sewer cover being lifted from its hole and dropped to the asphalt . " She 's only kidding , " Tony repeated . " Yes , " said Cherry . " A round of applause ? " She clapped her palm to give substance to the small bored skitteringof palms which answered her . Then the pianist hit a few chords . Cherry was going to sing a hymn . Every day with Jesus , sang Cherry . Is sweeter than the day before . Every day with Jesus , I love him more and more . She stopped for her pause , looked at the audience and brought her hands together in devotion . She looked like she was ready to burst into a belly laugh . Jesus saves and keeps me . He 's the one I 'm waiting for . Every day with JesusIs sweeter than the day before . It was the best song she had sung all night , it had the most of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came trooping into my mind , the light on the drinking glasses like the light off their eyeglasses , white lined faces with vertical wrinkles on the upper lip , passion scarred by righteousness , madness in the eye , that insane lust which whips over empty graves , devotion locked in arthritic joints.  |p116Every  day with Jesus , I love him more and more , sang Cherry , running up and down the pianist 's chords with a body 's joy in her throat , balm to the nettles these ladies must have left in her , and yet there was art in the song for she did not hate them altogether , they were witches too , hateful little old witches now , but they had had love for somebody , for a nephew or a brother or a young uncle long dead , they had kept somebody 's old letters tied about with ribbon , or helped one pregnant girl ; in the icelocks of their rheumatism flowed a nerve of Christian vein , romance to remindthem of one soft lover dead and life in the breath of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the day before . Everybodysing , " said Cherry , and as if I were a middle-aged prep-school type come to reunion after all those years of waiting , I got to my feet and sang the lines with her , moving my highball glass in great sweeps of my arm like a beer stein used as a pendulum . Sweeter than the day before . We were alone . The humors of this intoxication flowed from her to me and then flowed back again , while the pianist came into it now and then like an animated movie mouse prancing in time at a wedding of two great cats . But that was next to all of it . A drunk who had just come in bellowed the last word of every line , and the judge 's tarts started to sing in tender little falsettos only to be decapitatedby a look from the judge . Others were silent . Tony was livid . As Cherry came off the stand , she said , " Okay , that 's it . " " You 're not quitting , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy . " " I have an American flag , Tony , and I 'm going to send it to you for Christmas . As a tablecloth . " " Sing in the bathtub , baby , that 's where you 're singing now . I 'm going to bum-rep you at every joint in town . " " I 'm going to change my clothes , " Cherry said to me . " I 'll wait for you , " I said . Tony and I were now alone . We avoided each other 's eyes andp117stood there side by side in a contest : his presence against my presence , two sea creatures buried deep in the ocean silt of a grotto , exuding the repellent communications of sea creatures . Tony 's oppression was muddy , a stench of wet concrete . I could feel him burying me beneath it . So I called on Deborah . How many times talking to Deborah had my hand gone to my throat  --  doubtless she had been drawing an imaginary razor down one ear and up the other . Small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put my hand in my pocket to feel my pocketknife and took it on a small mental trip into my palm where figuratively I opened it , reached across , and made a slash into Tony 's neck deep across the apple . " That 's the way , " said Deborah in my ear , " at last you 're learning . Put some salt in the wound . " " Where do I find salt ? " I asked of her . " From the tears of anyone this man has been able to oppress . There 's your salt . Rub it in . " So I called for some distillate of sorrow , and so powerful was the impression returned that my fingertips felt a grit of white crystal with which they could travel to Tony 's neck , and there some part of my mind must have rubbed it in . I could feel his discomfort . He shifted his feet . Then he spoke . " It 's hot in here . " " Yes , " I said . " Too bad about your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It did not put him off . " I used to know her , " he said . " For fact ? " " I had another joint uptown . She used to drop in with friends . " Cherry had come out of a back room . She was carrying a suitcaseand wearing a street dress and a cloth overcoat . " Let 's get outof here , " she said to me , and without a backward look at Tony wentfor the door . I started to follow her , but the center of my back toldp118me Tony was going to loose a knife and loose it good . " Yes , " said Tony , " your wife , Mr. Rojack , was a real swinger . " " You know , " I said to Tony , " it 's a pity about your uncle 's disease . " " He takes it well , " said Tony . On that echo , I left with her . We had breakfast in a coffee shop , eating a little pinched meal of English muffins and tea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once , as I brought the cup to my lips , I noticed my hand was trembling . So did she . " You 've had a night , " she said . " It is n't the night , " I said , " it 's the morning ahead . " " You 're afraid of the next few hours ? " " I 'm always afraid , " I said . She did n't laugh , she nodded . " I went to a shrink , " she said . " Any good reason ? " " I was feeling suicidal . " " Beautiful women do . " " Spookier than that . " " Yes . " " Do n't you think there 's a moment when it 's right to commit suicide ? " " Perhaps . " " Like it 's your last chance ? " " Explain that to me . " " You ever live with the dead ? " She said this with her practical American face . " No , " I said . " I do n't really know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daddy all the while I was growing up , and they were dead . They died when I was four years and five months old . They smashed up in an automobile . So I lived with an older brother and older sis . " " Were they nice ? " " Shit , no , " said Cherry , " they were half crazy . "  |p119She  lit a cigarette . The circles beneath her eyes looked back with fatigue , the green going to purple at the edges of her lids and fading out along her cheek to a bruise-colored yellow . " When you live with the dead you come to see , " she said , " that there is a particular day in a particular year when they 're ready to welcome you . You have to take that day . Because if you do n't , you can die on a day when nobody is waiting for you and you just wander . That 's why , when it comes , the impulse pulls so hard . I know . There was a day for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running to a shrink . " ' Well , " I said , " maybe you have to take a chance on dying that particular day . But if you take the chance and get through it , maybe you 're not as close to suicide the next time . Maybe , whatever it is , ca n't draw on you as hard . " " You 're an optimist . " She touched my hand . " Still feeling scared ? " she asked . " Not as much . " But I was lying . The dread had settled in on my last brave speech . To be not afraid of death , to be ready to engage it  --  sometimes I thought I had more of a horror of dying than anyone I knew . I was so unfit for that moment . " It 's going to be full moon for how many days ? " I asked . " Three days more , " she said . " Yes . " " You say you 're afraid , " she said , " do you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't believe I belong in them . " " You do n't ? " I was close to telling her something I had not told anyone else . " I would n't want to make too much of it , " I said . I did not go on to say that when I was in bed with a woman , I rarely felt as if I were making life , but rather as if I were a pirate sharpening up a raid on life , and so somewhere inside myself  --  yes , there was a large part of the fear  --  I had dread of the judgment which must rest behind the womb of a woman . A small perspiration came out along my back.  | " How about a drink ? " I asked . " You serving drinks ? " " We ca n't go to my place , " Cherry said . " Tony will telephone every fifteen minutes . Then he 'll send somebody around to knock on the door . " " Well , we ca n't go to my place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associates , and  --  family . " Barney Oswald Kelly was coming to town . Or at least he was coming to town if Roberts was telling the truth , and why should he not ? The thought of my father-in-law , whom I had not seen eight times in my married life , but knew well enough to fear profoundly , was a subject so vast , however , I put it away from me altogether , the way one can separate one 's mind from a contemplation of the land mass of Asia . " Yes , " I said , " let 's stay faraway from my apartment . " " I do n't want to go to a hotel , " she said . " No . " She sighed . " I have a place . It 's a special place . " " I 'll treat it with respect . " " It 's too soon to go there , " she said . " We have no choice , princess . " " Oh , Stephen , " said Cherry , " Hula , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Side and there on this cold misty March morning with a gray in the sky to equal the breath of those wet city streets , we climbed the five flights of a tenement , up past the sweet bruised rotting wood odors of a warehouse cellar for cheap wine , on up the stairs , the dirty light bulbs at each landing covered by a wire cage with threaders of dust as thick and intricate as moss . The garbage was out on the landings , the high peppery smell of Puerto Rican cooking , that odor of garlic , pig 's viscera and incompatible condiments , a teeming misery . At the top of each flight , the door to the latrine was open , moisture seeped off the floor . The stench of slum plumbing gave a terror of old age  --  how ill is illness , how vile the suggestion of villainous old bowels . Going up those stairs I was no more a lover than a soldier crossing enemy land . " Fail here at love , " said the odor , " and you get closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a child was screaming in mortal terror , she sounded like she was being whacked to death , and at every landing the doors opened a split and brown eyes looked forth , five feet high , three feet high , eyes a foot from the floorone-year-oldswho had not yet learned to stand . Cherry had her keys out and opened the door after turning the tumbler in two separate locks , but the bolts flew up with a clanking sound , surprisingly sepulchral for two cylinders so small , and I could feel the ears which connected to all those eyes bright as marmosets watching us . " I run that gauntlet every time , " she said . " I 've come here at three in the morning and one in the afternoon , and they 're always looking out the door . " She took off her coat , lit a cigarette , put it out , lit the gas heater , and went to a cupboard where she got two glasses and a bottle to pour us each a drink . The refrigerator was an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came off the lead-gray cubes she chiseled free from the tray . I had been about to help but she did the job with one quick thump from the heel of her hand on an ice pick , and went on talking easily as she washed the rocks in the water from the sink , the pipes growling like some old dogs chased in their sleep . " My sister used to live here , " Cherry said . " She wanted to study painting . So I staked her a little bit . Just a bit . It 's her furniture . " " And she moved out ? " After a pause , " Yes , it 's my place now . Sometimes I feel guilty , " she said , " that I keep it and hardly use it when all these families are here jammed into one another . But it was my younger sister 's place . I do n't want to give it up . " There was only the one room in which we stood , a living-room dining-room kitchen and bedroom twelve feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cracked and the colors of the furniture were innocent  --  tomato orange , reds , green , the sort of colors full of appetite a young girl who knew nothing of fashionp123might pick for her first year in New York . There was a double bed on legs with no headboard , a couch with one broken leg , a bridge table , two metal folding chairs , a movie director 's canvas seat and an easel . On the wall were a number of paintings hung unframed but for a quarter-inch width of pine stripping , and at the far end of the apartment two windows had the luck to present a long view . There , beyond the back of the tenement , was a cemetery , one of the few left on Manhattan Island . " Are these your sister 's paintings ? " I asked . I did not wish to ask the question but I could feel her waiting . " Yes . " " Let me look . " But I was irritable suddenly , a sign of fatigue , the only sign of fatigue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire for the new drink . Sometime in the next hours or the next day would come a moment when I would lie down , when I would sleep  --  when I would try to  --  and then the memories of this night gone through would rise like the mutilated corpses of a battlefield . Now the liquor still enclosedme , a golden carriage lined with red velvet : installed inside I could drive over the battlefield , stare back at the battered face of Deborah which rose from each corpse . I did not want to look at the paintings . I could see much too much , and there was much which was dull in Cherry 's sister , much which was mess , wads and drippings , a red maniacal edge altogetherunstable . The paintings made a sad contrast to the tomato-orange and bright green of the furniture . She must have seemed an exuberant girl . I hesitated to go on . There was a tension in me like the taste of the bit in the jaws of a horse who wanted to gallop . Put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has been three days without a butt  --  underneath everything I wanted sex now , not for pleasure , not for love , but to work this tension : ignore the leaden , almost sensuous fatigue I felt in my heart as I climbed the stairs , I neededp124sex , I wanted it very much . I could not lie , however , I had some sense her sister 's paintings were more than a fence to be gone over as nicely as possible  --  no , they were the door to some private estate . If I went on , I could spoil it all . Yet the paintings made me irritable ; they were piggish . But we could not begin with a lie between us . It was as if I had some desperate knowledge now , as if some message had come to me from the end of the world that I was close to the end of the world . If I was to make one last play , well , no carfare home , the money had to be put up now . I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " I said , " I 'm not going to until I lie the first time . " " All right , " said Cherry . " Something happened to your sister , did n't it ? " " She crack up ? " " She cracked up and then she died . " There was no emotion in her voice . Something flat and little had settled on the event . " I Iow did she die ? " " She got hurt by a man she was going with . He was nothing but a pimp . He beat her up one night and she did n't recover from that . She just crawled back here . She asked me to take care of her . " Cherry revolved her glass in a small circle , rattling the cubes , exorcisinga curse . " Then a couple of days later , " Cherry said in a bright voice , " she waited till I went out and took thirty sleeping pills and cut her wrist . After which she got up from bed , and died at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump . She wanted to be in the cemetery , I suppose . " " What happened to the pimp ? " I asked at last . Cherry 's face took on the look of a rock-hard little jockey recollectingan ugly race . Something cruel and dedicated went by her mouth . " I had him taken care of , " she said . " Did you know the pimp ? " " I do n't want to talk about it any more . "  |p125I  had the clean eye of a district attorney who has missed a career in surgery . " You knew the pimp ? " " I did n't know him . She was only going with that pimp because she was half-crazy . She had been in love with somebody else . And she lost him . To me . I took her boy friend away . " Cherry shivered . " I never thought I 'd do something like that , but I did . " " Was it Tony ? " " Oh , Jesus , of course it was n't Tony . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , honey , Shago Martin the explorer . " Now Cherry finished her drink and poured another . " You see , baby , " she said , " dig : my sister was just one of six girls Shago had waiting for him every time he passed through New York . And I decided she was too dedicated to him ; she was just a kid . So I got together with her and Shago to shame him out of it , and crash ! I became one of the six girls he had waiting for him in New York . I mean Shago 's a stud , Mr. Rojack . " The word went in like a blow to the soft part of my belly . There was something final in the verdict as if there were a sexual round robin where the big people played . All the big Negroes and the big Whites . " Bless me for taking your time , " I said . She laughed suddenly . " I do n't want to chase you clean out of your pants . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love with Shago . Then after a while he was in love with me . He could n't help it . A nice White Southern Girl like me . I suppose when a man 's in love , he 's no more of a stud than any other man who 's in love . " She smiled . She gave me a wry smile . " Well , I happen to feel like a stud right now , " I said . It was true . I was reacting from that blow to the belly and a mean edge was up again in me . I could see Deborah 's face staring in the morgue , the one green eye , but I felt no fear this time , I felt instead as if I owned the hatred in her eye.  | " I 'm feeling pretty mean myself , " Cherry said . It was in that glow that we made ready to go to bed . She opened a screen about the kitchen sink and walked behind it to undress , while I picked off my clothes and got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheets expensive ( she , not her sister , must have brought them in ) and lay there shuddering with cold , for the iron ice of a tenement 's winter had settled on the cloth . I thought of graveyards and the cemetery outside and the Romanesque stone arch of Sever Hall at Harvard  --  I had not thought of Sever Hall in twenty years , perhaps it was twenty years since I felt such cold  --  but I knew at this instant I could have stood at the North Pole and pulled off my clothes , it was as if all the iron in me had gotten itself together for one good show against the winds . She slipped out from behind the sink . Wearing a wheat-colored wrapper , and the pained professional smile of a modesty which had been disregarded a hundred times , she slipped modestly into bed beside me . Her ass was indeed a prize  --  with my hands on her , life came back to me again across all the glaciers of my fatigue . But we did not meet as lovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across a track of the jungle to join in a clearing , we were equals . So we made love without preliminary  --  not thirty seconds had gone by before I slipped quietly into her . The separate cheats of her body and her life collected on one scale of justice to match the weight I could put on mine  --  her life up to this moment was the equal of my own , good to good , bad to bad , the submerged vision of my sex moved with a freedom from vanity or the haste to give pleasure . It was cool in mood , as if we were two professional dancers in a long slow study alone at night on a moonlit floor . I felt I could go on forever . Exhaustionhad freed me . I was alive in some deep water below sex , some tunnel of the dream where effort was divorced at last from price . She was exquisite . She was exquisitely sensitive . Again , I had expected no less . Some cool blonde sense of violet shadow lived inp127the turn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was impossible to make a mistake . Yet only the act was tender . Nothing was loving in her ; no love in me ; we paid our devotions in some church no larger than ourselves , we met in some depth beneath the lights and salts of one 's eyes and mind . Fatigue had left me all but dead  --  I had no brain left , no wit , no pride , no itch , no smart , it was as if the membrane of my past had collected like a dead skin to be skimmed away . From some great distance , as if I were an observer on the moon , I had some distant awareness that my breath could hardly be good and her lungs breathed back an air of ashes and the tomb , but this rot of liquor and nicotine we now passed back and forth had nothing to do with the part of me now alive . I traveled ( eyes sealed ) through some midnight of inner space , aware of nothing but my will , that casing of iron about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girdle of steel about her womb . We reached into some middle ground of a race , we were like bicycle riders caught in the move of lap after lap around a track , soon we would be nothing but a rhythm which was nothing but a rhythm which would pump on to a climax I knew now would never come , and in the center of this vortex she flattened her fingers on the back of my neck with a hard little gesture , as if to ask , " Do you want to now ? " but from an instinct I did not question , I said , " No , I do n't want to . . . I ca n't so long as you have that thing in you , " which I never said before , and she shifted , I was out , the shock comparable to banging one 's head on a low beam , and then I searched for that corporate rubbery obstruction I detested so much , found it with a finger , pulled it forth , flipped it away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a warm pool , I was back in her , our wills now met , locked in a contestlike an exchange of stares which goes on and on , wills which begin at last in the force of equality to water and to loose tears , to soften into some light which is shut away again by the will to force tears back , steel to steel , until steel shimmers in a mist of dew , isp128wiped , is wet again . I was passing through a grotto of curious lights , dark lights , like colored lanterns beneath the sea , a glimpse of that quiver of jeweled arrows , that heavenly city which had appeared as Deborah was expiring in the lock of my arm , and a voice like a child 's whisper on the breeze came up so faint I could hardly hear , " Do you want her ? " it asked . " Do you really want her , do you want to know something about love at last ? " and I desired something I had never known before , and answered ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roots ; and , " Yes , " I said , " of course I do , I want love , " but like an urbane old gentleman , a dry tart portion of my mind added , " Indeed , and what has one to lose ? " and then the voice in a small terror , " Oh , you have more to lose than you have lost already , fail at love and you lose more than you can know . " " And if I do not fail ? " I asked back . " Do not ask , " said the voice , " choose now ! " and some continent of dread speared wide in me , rising like a dragon , as if I knew the choice were real , and in a lift of terror I opened my eyes and her face was beautiful beneath me in that rainy morning , her eyes were golden with light , and she said , " Ah , honey , sure , " and I said sure to the voice in me , and felt love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wings at my back , and felt her will dissolve into tears , and some great deep sorrow like roses drowned in the salt of the sea came flooding from her womb and washed into me like a sweet honey of balm for all the bitter sores of my soul and for the first time in my life without passing through fire or straining the stones of my will , I came up from my body rather than down from my mind , I could not stop , some shield broke in me , bliss , and the honey she had given me I could only give back , all sweets to her womb , all come in her cunt . " Son of a bitch , " I said , " so that 's what it 's all about . " And my mouth like a worn-out soldier fell on the heart of her breast . That was the way I fell asleep . And I fell asleep . I went sliding down a run , a bounce and tumble buffeted with pillows . Then my flesh gave out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped into sleep like a boat garnering its dock on the last swell of momentum , motors stopped : there was a delicious instant when I knew that nothing would blow , no break would call me back from rest . Once years ago , in those years when our marriage first was fortifiedwith the taste of cruelty more gamy than pleasure , I said to Deborah , on an evening when all went bad , " If we were in love , we would sleep with our arms around each other , and never want to move . " " Darling , I 'm withering from fever , " Deborah answered . I went to sleep with my arms around Cherry . Hours went by , four hours , five hours  --  I came up like a diver , resting at each level , my body waking as I emerged . When I finally opened my eyes ( I must have been ready ten minutes before the desire arrived ) I knew everything was all right inside the room . Outside everything was wrong . Knowledge arrived from outside  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning that he is black . There was no desire to take my pulse . I was a murderer . I was : murderer . No rush to do more than study her . She had a different set of featuresfor each station of her dream . She was so sound asleep . Masks of greed and cruelty came into focus in her face , became intense , broke apart from their own force . A soft child 's face unfolded beneath . One was watching a film which gathered into a minute that metamorphosis of the weeks when the hard envelope of a bud cracks away , and the flower opens . Then , abruptly , the flower wilted . A new bud , hard , all horn at the point , came through the dying leaves , a vulgar egomania passed through the hardness of its spike , sensual features thrusting at me through sleep , pitiless calculation of a female with velvet to sell , she drew cupidity out of her limbs , whore 's lore , her expression steeped into a cream of past thieveries , swallowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sour mask now of disappointments , bitcheries , mean self-pity , yes , the mask was harsh again , it came to its crust , cracked , and in her sleep a sweetp130blonde girl of seventeen smiled back at me , skin almost luminous , a golden child , pure Georgia peach , a cheer leader , sweet fruit , nationalcreation . I touched the tip of her nose . Dumb little nose , the nostrils were all visible in the tilt of its tip , confident nostrils ready to breathe the air directly in front of them . I wanted to wake her up then . I had a need to talk a little , and I concentrated on the wish she awaken , concentrated so powerfully she began to stir , but then , as if the fatigues she must clear had flashed some panic at being unhonored , her face turned old , she looked middle-aged , a pinched concern drew worried lines about her nose , crimped her mouth , she groaned like an invalid crying out , " I sicken if I awake , my separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought , " All right , then , sleep your sleep . " She relaxed , a smile , a little curl of amusement gave the scent of flesh to the open curl of her lip . There was a clock above my head . It was three past three in the afternoon . I was due to see Roberts at half-past five . So I got up then , separating myself like an artist , feeling no desire to fleece her rest , and put on my clothes in the dry warm air . Her gas heater had been going , and the air was close but the exhaust was vented into the fireplace so there was no smell  --  I had a passing fancy that the way I felt was kin to a pie in a warming oven , yes that was how my skin felt . I got dressed and did not bother to look for a razor . I would shave at home . Before I left I stopped to write a note . Hey , you sleep deep . But what a sight ! See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wondered where she would be when I was ready to come back . Once again I came close to waking her . " Going to try to be here by tonight , " I put in parentheses at the foot of the page . " If you have to be out , leave a note where , when , " and came close to an instant of pure anguish . Would I ever get back to this place ? The thought of Leznicki opened a grave in my stomach . Well , I closed her door behind me , gently , so the spring lockp131would not snap too loud , and went down the stairs , sensing the eyes of Puerto Ricans upon me , and on the street fresh air came into my lungs like an intricate message of alarm . I was back , the world , an auto horn struck my ear like a screamer on an unhappy New Year 's Eve , there was ambush everywhere . I was still drunk , I suppose . My head felt clear , too clear , I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not painful so much as open to the promiseit would last for more than a day . My body was drunk . Its nerves were alive , my flesh felt new  --  fact , it was almost a pleasure to walk , for I could feel the links which went into a step . And the air came into my nose with the history of its circuits -- all the compromised souls of the dead up from the river and cobblestonespermeated with the horse wagons of the last steep century , dogs around the corner , hot-dog grease from a griddle like the stale savory of the poor in rut , the blast of gas from a bus ( that Egyptian mummy which lives beneath the rot ) a moment of stiflings and suffocations like some childhood fight in which one is being extinguished by a bully ( Deborah must have died with such smell in her lungs ) and then I heard from clear across the city , over the Hudson in the Jersey yards , one fierce whistle of a locomotive which took me to a train late at night hurling through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blighting the darkness . One hundred years before , some first trains had torn through the prairie and their warning had congealed the nerve . " Beware , " said the sound . " Freeze in your route . Behind this machine comes a century of maniacs and a heat which looks to consume the earth . " What a rustling those first animals must have known . I got a taxi . The driver was smoking a cigar and talked about Harlem all the way up , his absolute refusal to enter it . Finally I shut his sound out and sat there grappling with a ravening desire for drink . I do n't know if I ever wanted one so much  --  I cried within like a just-cracked vase might shriek for cement ( that second when I thought of Leznicki had separated me one half from the other )  |p132I  sat up straight in the rear of the cab with a weak sick perspiration oozing my clothes  --  that much was I reduced by the effort not to tell the driver to stop each fifty yards we passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molar , hanging on , knowing I was at a turn , knowing if I took a drink now  --  I , who loved to drink , I who could use whiskey for blood  --  that the corner would be turned , I 'd be hooked , whiskey my opium . No , I had to get through the day , hold out , I had to hold out , not take a drink , not till I was back with Cherry  --  that was the first demand from my new contract , that moment in the morning when I had made a pact . And I thought of Ruta then , and the desire for drink added her to everything . Sick , wet , shivering with panic , I had nonetheless a quick thought of her up against these flowers of red-velvet flock , red pepper to the itch , Satan 's heaven at the thought of diving into a bar , and calling her . " Ruta , do you remember your friend the doctor , the crazy doctor who was no better than his patient ? " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The Genius sees you sitting in the lap of blue uniforms . " " The New York gendarmerie are handsome when the case is good . " " Could you consider leaving them ? " " Only for the most thorough examination , geliebter Doktor . " " See me for a consultation . " " But you have moved your office . " " Merely to the Irish bar on First Avenue .. We would drink for hours , then disappear into some Germanic fleabag of a hotel , a bed fortified with the crazy molecules of a thousand fornications , one hundred sodomies , and the Devil 's tale of the tongues . We would tie one good one on , two days , three days , five empty bottles at the foot of the bed . My heart was racing up like a trapped bird once more . I was on the run . Like a petty criminal I had sold my jewels last night to the Devil , and promised them again this morning to some child'sp133whisper . I had a literal sense of seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's womb , into the rich extinctions of Ruta 's kitchen . That second time I made love to Ruta  --  where had I left it then ? I could not remember , and this fact : yes to the Devil , yes to the Lord , now seemed rabid with importance , more important than Leznicki , Deborah , Deborah 's father  --  my heart bolted like a horse  --  more important even than my desire for a drink . Do you know psychosis ? Have you explored its cave ? I had gone out to the end of my string . It was stretching behind me  --  I could feel it ready to snap . " He hails me and I do n't even want to look at him . But there 's a cop at the intersection . . . . " My mind was going off to chase the million fish of its expired seed , my brain was lifting behind it , my brain had decided to float away . " And he gives me a hard time . The cops are chicken about niggers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Well , to make a long story short . . . " " Take your fare . " The fresh air was keeping me alive . I passed a bar . Walked on . My feet led me past . The sweat no longer oozed  --  it had collected into rivers . I was weak but I was coming back to my separate parts : college professor , television performer , marginal socialite , author , police suspect , lecher , newly minted lover of a thrush named Cherry . I had roots , weed 's roots : Jewish father , immigrant stock ; Protestant mother , New Englandbanking family , second-drawer . Yes , now I was back with the living . I could pass the bars . They went by like milestones , satisfying my sense of distance traveled on away from a crossroads where an ambush had been waiting . Now I felt small as a business man with a load of worries equal near to bankruptcy . I bought several newspapers , took another cab , and went backp134to my apartment . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go too thoroughly through the news stories . They splashed the front page , spoke of the death as suicide , gave details about Deborah and details about me , half of them correct , half incorrect , gave promise in their excitement that the story was good for two days more and probably a feature for the weekend round-up , they hinted  --  but very lightly  --  that police were in the scene , they announcedme as unavailable for comment , Barney Oswald Kelly as unavailable for comment , and the television studio and the universityas willing to give no comment . An unidentified colleague at the university was quoted as saying , " They were a splendid couple . " Two of the papers had used the same picture of Deborah . It was a terrible picture and years old . " Beautiful Young Society Matron Takes Life in Plunge , " said the little headline over the photograph , and beneath was Deborah looking fat and ugly and somewhatidiotic for she was getting out of a limousine at a wedding and was caught with a frozen supercilious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographer , " Shall I look like this for the masses ? " I turned to the society page . There was a column I always read : " The Social Reins "  --  Francis " Buck " Buchanan . He was a friend of Deborah 's , for all I knew he was a beau , and for the year of our separation I had sometimes been able to follow the turns of her feeling toward me since Buchanan printed what she desired to have put in print , and a nice remark meant I was in her favor once more ; my exclusion from a party list of twenty names signified she was displeased still again . " Deborah Is No Longer With Us , " went Buchanan 's headline , and it ran from left to right across the top of the page . Polite Society and Night Society were reeling in the wee hours this morning from the shock of Deborah Kelly Rojack 's unforgettable and tragic demise . None of us could believe that the charming Deborah , oldest daughter of internationally re/spected king-maker Barney Oswald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer with us . The beautiful Deborah is dead . Never again will we hear the patrician tones of her merry laugh or see the wicked wit in her eye . " I want to dance till the last note is played , " was Deborah 's motto . " The salad years are not over , they 're just a little weary , poor glorious salad , " was Deborah 's private confession to friends . Too proud ever to tell a soul , she must last night have heard the last note . Those of us who knew her well know she brooded in secret over the failure of her marriage to former Congressman Stephen Richards Rojack , and it is even reported as we go to press that Steve was in the room when Deborah took the step . Perhaps she wished him to hear the last note . Perhaps ... Deborah 's end is shrouded in mystery . We can not believe her dead . She was so alive . Poor Tootsie Haenniger . Tootsie loaned Deborah her bijou East Side duplex for the month she was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It went on . On for a double column the length of the page and inches of overflow into a new column , a quick haul of anecdotes , it listed fifty people  --  her dearest friends  --  and then like a trumpet blowing taps to the mournful grandeur of a violent death , as if one virtue of violent death might be to open at last some secret gates for conscientious readers , Buchanan finished with a laid-out table of everything to which Deborah had at one time or another belonged : charities , leagues , cotillions , balls , foundations , sisters , societies , and such odd-name congeries as The Caveat Napoleon , the Lasters , the Bahama Rifles , the Clambs , the Quainger , the Croyden Heart , the Spring Oak Subscription , the Philadelphia Riding , the Kerrybombos . What a secret life had Deborah . I had not known a third of everything to which she enlisted . That endless stream of intimate woman 's lunches into which she disappeared every perfumed noon over the years  --  what princes must have been elected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the insight of an ice pick the precise thought came to me that I had lost my own marriage without ever a chance to fight for it on anp136open field . What a garroting must have been given my neck by the ladies of those lunches , those same ladies or their mothers who worked so neatly to make me a political career all eighteen years ago . It did n't matter . At this instant the past was like a burned-out field after the blaze has gone through . I had a bad moment turning the key to the apartment . I was like a gambler who lives in fear of a card . It is the Queen of Spades , and each time it appears disaster has come up another step . So each time I felt the presence of Deborah , it was as if the card turned high . And she was everywhere in my apartment , there in the echo of all those nights I slept without her , fighting those early-morning wars when every one of my cells insisted I was losing her into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would not pick up the phone . Now in the apartment something had died  --  all memories of Deborah living . An odor of death in a trash pit rose from the wastebasketswith their stale cigarettes , the garbage can in the kitchen , the musk of stale memories in stale furniture , death lived like a beast in this air . Would one go scraping over the crusted lip of the incineratorinto the sour end of sour ashes ? Like a fever the desire for one stiff drink came over me again . I passed through the living room , that hateful living room of champagne-colored settees and champagne paper on the walls , another of Deborah 's flings with a decorator , silver-gray , pale green , cream , all the colors of face powder , the arbitrary palette of elegance : I had always felt like Deborah 's footmansitting in that room . My fist was clenched . The phone was ringing . It went four times , five times , the answer service picked it up , and I kept hearing an after-ring  --  the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house . There must be a hundred messages by now but I could not think of them . I did not know how long I could bear this apartment  --  dreadworked up through my middle like the gray water in the machines of a midnight laundry . In the bathroom , I couldp137have been buried to the waist in this grease water of dread : only the touch of the razor was alive  --  it drew something clean across my cheek like the smell of the ocean on a summer morning . My cheek felt like a window looking out on such a light while I remained prisoner in the closet . The phone was ringing still again . I rinsed my face , made a debate whether to dress first or first take care of messages , but the answer was simple : I had to be dressed so I could get out in a minute . I picked a summer gray suit with a quiet superimposed gray plaid , black shoes , a blue-gray shirt , a black knit tie , a handkerchief for the breast pocket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , breathing all the while with the anxiety of an asthmatic on the edge of an attack . Once again the phone was ringing . This time I answered . It was the producer of my television show . " Steve , oh boy , oh friend . How do you feel ? " " Cold as ice , Arthur . " The answer service was also on the line . " Mr. Rojack , will you call us soon as you finish this call . We have to give you several messages . " " Yes , Gloria , thank you . " " Oh , Christ , boy , you 've laid this studio in a panic . Will you take our commiserations ? " " Yes . Thanks , Arthur . " " No , I mean , Steve , anxiety is loose here today . It has n't been so bad since Kennedy stood up to Khrushchev with the missiles . Poor Deborah . I only met her once , but she 's a great woman . " " Yes . Was . " " Steve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm a little rocky , kid . " " I 'll bet . I 'll bet . These dependencies we feel on women . When they go , it 's like losing mother . " If Deborah were not dead , but had merely run off to Europep138with another man , Arthur would have said , " It 's like losing mother 's tit . " " Have you seen your analyst this morning ? " I asked . " You bet on that , Steve . I was there at eight A.M. I caught the news on the midnight news last night . " " Yes . " His voice shifted for a moment , as if , suddenly , he was aware again of the fact . " Steve , are you really all right ? Can you talk ? " " Yes , I 'm really all right . " " My analyst said I have to level with you . One of the great hang-ups on the program is that I 've never been able to enter a relation with you . My anxieties tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus . I guess I 've been defeating myself before your sense of social superiority . " " Arthur , stop this slop , will you . I 'm going to scream . " " I 've tried to reach you six times today . I got myself up for it six times , and each time , Steve , I caught your fright-wig answer service . I 'm raddled now , Steve , I 'm hysterical . The pressure here this morning has been pressure cooker . The newspapers want a statementon the future of the show . " " I ca n't think about that now . " " Baby , you got to . Look , I know I 've always been deficient in the amenities , and think too much in terms of social response , status , public reaction ... " " Check . " ... rather than trying to manifest some sort of false gentry 's grace for hideous moments like this . " " You damned beggar ! " I shouted at him . " You shit-f ace . " " You 're bereaved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could hear explications running into qualifications , then the considered tone of self-examination , the scar tissue at the top of his nose where the adenoids hadp139been removed vibrating now with the complacency of an oboe reed . Then I heard him pause and shift  --  we had come to another body of the conversation . " It 's cancer gulch down here , admittedly , but a local station suffers from tensions the networks are not subject to . You know we 've been embattled more with your program than anything else , and now you see we 've got a couple of cathexis-loaded projects besides yours , a real collision load . You know we 're beginning the Shago Martin show next month , it 's our integration bit , the first time we 're going to have a Negro singer doing lowdown funky intime duets with a white canary . " " What 's her name , " I asked , " the canary . " " Rosalie . . . I think . " " Not Cherry ? " " No , Cherry Melanie was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you spell Melanie ? " " M-e-l-a-n-i-e . Are you drunk ? " " Why did n't she get it ? " " Because Rosalie does her libidinal bit with Numero Uno . " " Dodds Mercer Merrill ? " " Dodds , our boss Dodds , that roaring faggot , believe it or not . He makes the chick scene from time to time . " Arthur giggled . " You know what he said to me once , It 's all friction . ' " " And he 's putting his girl Rosalie in with Shago Martin ? " " Dodds is gone on black men , boy . Do n't you dig these things ? " He paused . " Stephen , " he went on in a level voice , " my analyst gave me a formal verbal directive not to get sloughed in talking to you . The point of this conversation has still not been engaged . We 're in difficulties , boy . " " Why do n't you just say the show will not be on the air for a short period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Remember you once said Marx said , Quantity changes qual-ity ' ? " " I remember there were fifty letters complaining I quoted Marx favorably . " " This is one of those times . The quantity of publicity , and the contingent innuendo . . . " " That 's good , boy . That 's corporation lawyer . " " Steve , it 's not that anybody thinks you gave Deborah a shove . Christ , I do n't . I stood up to Dodds for five minutes today telling him you were essentially a sweet guy with a brilliant mind , a latent genius , and if you had a personal problem or two , well you were n't the only man on television who was known to tipple a bit and chase hump . But that did n't crack ice . I 've never seen ice like the ice here this morning . A morgue . A polar morgue . " " A polar morgue . " " Dodds said the critical factor is this : no audience is going to trust a man whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " See what I mean ? No audience in the world . " " I see . " " I could cry , Steve . " " Check . " " It was a great program , Steve . " " Nice to be associated with you , Arthur . " " Bless you , baby , for saying that . I dig , now I dig the anxiety this conversation gave me in advance . It was a cancerous demand that was made on me to have to do this to you . " " Bless , Arthur , bless . " " Yeah . " " So long . " " Ciao . " The phone rang . It was the answer service . The messages werep141not as numerous as I had expected . There was a request from the head of the Psychology Department to call him , there were indeed five calls from Arthur , three calls from three different newspapers , several from good friends I wanted to talk to and did not care to talk to , and a request from Barney Oswald Kelly 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waldorf Towers . There were no calls from any of Deborah 's friends , nor were there any from the friends I had supposed we might have in common . I had never had much illusion that Deborah 's friends were ever the least divided in their loyalty , but the absolute silence at this moment seemed to deepen their silence in my apartment . " Gloria , " I said to the operatorwhen she finished , " do me a favor . Call the Waldorf Towers and make an appointment with Mr. Kelly . Tell his secretary I 'd like to see him at seven-thirty tonight . If the time is n't good , call me back . " " All right , I will , Mr. Rojack , of course I will . . . and listen , Mr. Rojack ... " " Yes . " " The girls here all want to say that they feel with you in your tragic loss . " " Oh , thank you , Gloria , it 's good of you to say that . " Was this how the French had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear , that they must lift their guns from their concrete emplacement and turn them around ? I had a knowledgeI must not stop making telephone calls until I was ready to leave . I dialed the head of my Department . " Dr. Tharchinan , " I began . " Stephen , " he said , " I 'm awfully glad to hear from you . I 've been so worried . I ca n't imagine a more heinous occasion for any of us , poor man . " " It 's been difficult , Frederick . As you know , Deborah and I have not been very close for a while , but it 's been an earthquake , yes . " " Just Godawful , I 'm sure . "  |p142There  was a silence between us . " I suppose the university has been bombarded by the news-papers . " " They 're termites , " Frederick said . " I really believe they 're termiteseating at the very substance of Western civilization . " The second silence was definitely lame . " It 's good of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Actually , I wanted to . I do n't mind being on the phone . " " Stephen , as you know , I 'm not a very religious man , but I went to chapel this morning . I wanted to say a prayer for Deborah . " I could seen his thin gray Presbyterian conscience taking him through the morning rain . I Ic had met Deborah just once at a faculty dinner , but she had charmed him utterly as a demonstration of what she could do for me . " Well , Deborah was religious , as you know , " I said now , " and perhaps she heard the prayer . " Now we were both embarrassed . I could feel him smarting to reply , " Good God , I hope not . " " Dr. Tharchman , I know we have to talk about practical matters , and I think under the circumstances , I 'm the one who must bring it up . " " Thank you , Stephen , we do have to talk . You see , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement to those damnable termites . What I 'm afraid of is they 'll start to talk to the professors and , God help us , the worst of the graduate students . You know how reporters are . They look for the married men with the beards . " He searched his throat for clearance . " I wo n't pretend , Stephen , that I 've been enraptured with the pure tenor of your ideas , but what you quite properly have not been aware of is the particular protection I 've tried to set up about you . I hate to think of the way you could be presented . One professor called this morning , I wo n't tell you his name , he insisted that one of his doctoral candi/dates who had taken the Voodoo seminar with you had the idea  --  I 'm afraid I have to tell you this  --  that you had been administering voodoo rites to Deborah . For some time . " " Good God . " " It 's enough to depress one about the nature of a faculty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I never knew I was talked about that way . " " Stephen , you 're a living legend . " The dry little voice stuck an instant over the last two words  --  discipline , envy , and decency were the separate protagonists of his character . I was liking Frederick for the first time . He had come in some years ago from the outside ( from the Midwest ) to be made head of the Department , and he was considered pedestrian , good for keeping the Ph.D . mill a Ph.D . mill . Nonetheless , it must not have been easy for him to grind out his decent portions of salt and meal for each of us . Good old Protestant center of a mad nation . I could hear his fingers drumming on his desk . " Well , Fred , what do you suggest ? " " The first question is whether you feel up to taking your classes immediately . I should think you do n't . " His voice closed that gate all but perfectly . " I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week to think . " " Right there is the difficulty . We must say one thing or another to the papers right away . Mass communication breeds in a vacuum . " " But , Frederick , I ca n't decide today . " " Well , I do n't see how you can . " " But I think work may be what I want . " " That 's what I do n't know . I 've thought about it all morning . If you were teaching organic chemistry or statistics , I 'd say , Plunge in . Work to the exclusion of all else . ' But your courses are personal . You have to use yourself . " " Nonsense , Fred , I 've been teaching for years . " " Nonsense  --  no . Magic , dread , and death as the center of moti/vation  --  it 's not the sort of subject to give you peace . I should think there 'd be an awful strain in the classroom . You might break under it . " " You mean some angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to school ? " " Do n't you agree we take as good a stand toward the trustees as any university you could name . But we ca n't despise them altogether , can we ? " " Fred , do you realize what a conversation this is ? " " I do n't know if I 've had one like it before . " " Really , " I said , " what could you lose ? " " It 's not measurable . A university can absorb scandal upon scandal . Then , one too many , and it 's incalculable what could happen . " Ile coughed . " Steve , this is academic . I ca n't believe you want to go back to work right away . " " But if I do ? Fred , what if I insist ? What will you do ? " " Oh , if you insist , I 'll be forced to go the president , and tell him it 's your right to work . " " And what will he do ? " " He will overrule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little flutter in Frederick 's throat . " Since I have tenure , I suppose I might be forced to go so far as to sue the university . " " Oh , you would n't do that , " Frederick said . " The case would be disagreeable in the extreme . " " What are you getting at ? " " I do n't want to talk about it any further . Your wife 's death is sufficiently tragic without beginning to mention the unhappy .. . the dreadful . . . the ambiguous aspects of it all . " " Oh , no ! " " Steve , this is the most unendurable conversation I 've had with anyone in years . We 'll never forgive each other for this one . " " We wo n't . " " I 've managed it abominably . Accept the reality , accept thep145reality . See it from the university 's point of view . Perhaps we feel we 've done our honorable best to pay the indefinable price and , yes , perhaps gain the even more indefinable benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most respectable people with a deep-seated sense of uneasiness . Consider that not every university would have put up with that television program of yours . Steve , ca n't we just leave it that this is a bastard of a day for everybody ? " Silence . " All right , Fred . What do you want ? " " Take a leave till the beginning of the fall semester . We 'll announceyour bereavement and retirement from active teaching duties for an indefinite period . Then we 'll see . " " Fred , somehow you 've won this one . " " I have n't , believe me . " Then he said quickly , " Steve ? " He was in a hurry to move on . His voice faltered for the first time . " Steve , I ca n't imagine anything more inappropriate , but I must ask you this . Perhaps you do n't know it , but my wife is a religious cultist . " " I did n't know . " But I should have guessed . I could see Gladys Tharchman up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silverrimmedeyeglasses , white hair , and her dowager 's hump over a thin body . " She subscribes to some of your ideas . " " What ? " " Oh , with sex extracted , of course . " He gave a chuckle ; we were coming back on course . " You see , she believes that the last meal a person eats before they die determines the migration of their soul . " " You mean if you die with a belly full of cereal you migrate to the wheat fields ! " " In her mind , it 's somewhat more complicated than that . Has to do with omens and lots and portents and whether one 's a meatp146soul or fish soul , and of course it 's not divorced from the phases of the moon and the horoscope . " " Demeter and Persephone . You poor bastard , Tharchman . " " She 's a marvelous woman , my wife , and this may be a small cross to bear . But I can tell you she 'll give me no quarter if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all good intention , she wishes to reach Deborah  --  Deborah made a vast impression on her  --  and for that she needs to know  --  " " What Deborah ate ? " " Dear God yes , Steve . Hecate has to know . " Now a skinny little sense of hilarity , as if he were a skinny boy in the blissful discomfortof asking an athlete the last line of a dirty joke , came into his voice . " Yes , Steve , what was in her tummy at the end ? " I could not resist . " Why , Fred , I 'll tell you , " I said . " Yes . " " It was rum . A bottle of rum , just about . " And hung up . In ten seconds the phone rang again . It was Tharchman . He was angry now . " You should n't have disconnected , Stephen , " he said , " because there was one thing more . " " Yes ? " His voice had a Midwestern twang , a sort of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clicked his tongue once . " I think you ought to know , " he said , " I 've been formally questioned about you today . " " By police ? " " No . Somebody much more hush-hush . What in Hell have you and Deborah been up to ? " And then he hung up . Next moment the phone rang again . My perspiration flowed . " Hello , Stephen ? " came a breathless voice . " Speaking . " " Stephen , I have to whisper . " ' Who is it ? " " Chookey-bah . " " Who ? "  | " Chookey-bah lamb . Gigot ! " " Gigot , how are you ? " " Chookey-bah , I 'm just chookey-bah . " " Well , crash ! " It was idiotic to have said this , but I was in a kind of exhilaration by now . There was a curious exhilaration as if we were all the subjects of a nation which had just declared war . So I said , " Crash , said it again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not chookey-bah really . I have to whisper . Blake 's in the next room , and he does n't want to speak to you . But I must . " " Speak to me . " She was one of Deborah 's ten best friends , which is to say that she was Deborah 's best friend for one month in every ten . She was also huge . She was five feet eleven and must have weighed one hundred and eighty pounds . She had a fortune of blonde hair which hung down to her waist or piled like a palisade six inches above her brow . She had the voice of a tiny little blonde five years old . " Blake thinks I 'm bound for the crazy house again . I told him I would ask Minot to shoot him if he committed me , and he said , Your brother Minot ca n't even shoot a hole in his own pants . ' Blake was obscene . I think he 's crazy . He never talks like that . Besideshe knows Minot is sexy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Blake thinks I 'm cockaloo over Deborah . I 'm not . I told her to jump last year . I said , Honey , you better go jump and squash yourself . You 're getting fat . ' And Deborah just gave that little pig laugh of hers , oink , oink , you know , and she said , Bettina , your advice is exquisite , but if you do n't stop , I 'm going to call Blake and tell him it 's time to have you cooped again , ' and she 'd do it . She did it to me once . I told her I knew she 'd been up to something with her Daddy-O , and she called my family , and had me in the hatch six hours later , in Paris , just the two of us , she was my roommate . "  | " When , Gigot ? " " Oh , years ago , I do n't know , some fearful time past . I never forgave her . French mental hospitals are unspeakable . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my family that I would marry the resident there , a funny little old dark French Jewish doctor who smelled like the Encyclopaedia Britannica , I swear he did , and my family sprung me . They were n't going to have some ratty little French Jew slurping up their soup and telling them how to go on a wild boar hunt , you know the French , they tell you everything whether they know it or not . God , I hate the French . " " Honey , I wonder if you do n't have a tidbit for me . " " I do . But I ca n't tell you now . My scalp is itching and that means Blake is going to come right back in this room . " " Well , before he does . " " Oh . I ca n't remember . Yes , now I do . Listen , when I said to Deborah that she ought to jump , she gave that bitchy smile of hers and poured me a glass of sherry , no , it was **26;5731;TOOLONG Madeira , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steve 's Madeira , it gets him so frantic if there is none , ' and then she said , Pet , I 'm not going to jump , I 'm going to be murdered . ' " " What ? " " Yes . She said that . She said it was in her horoscope . She said it was going to be terrifically catastrophic because Venus was together with Saturn and Uranus was in Aquarius . It was even worse than that . Every single planet was bad for her kind of Scorpio . " " You mean she said she was going to be killed last night ? " " I think she did . " " She killed herself . Gigot , you forget . " She sighed audibly . " Steve , you did n't do it , did you ? " " I did n't , " I said softly . " Steve , I 'm glad I called you . I thought I ought to call the police . Blake said he 'd break my nose if I called them and got my picture in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . He hates my gift ofp149smell  --  I once caught the teeniest whiff of perfume on him even though he 'd gone to a sauna bath afterward and tried to come back smelling like birch twigs . But I could smell the perfume and I could even smell the hands of the coon who 'd been giving him a massage . How do you like that ? " " Phenomenal . " " Steve , you are telling me the truth . I know you like me . " " Well , Gigot , if I had done it , could I tell you the truth , could I ? " " But you did n't ? " ' Well , maybe I did . You seem to think so . " " Oh , I guess she could have committed suicide . She was very upset about Deirdre , you know . She did n't know what to tell her about her father . " " Pamphli ? " " How do we know Pamphli was the father ? We do n't , do we , sheik ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt it , " I said . ' Well , a man never has anything but empty space between his certainties , " Gigot said . " Oh , darling Steve , I know it was n't suicide . Deborah knew she was going to be murdered . She was never wrong about that sort of thing . Steve , maybe somebody gave her poison that sent a message to her brain to make her jump . You know , some new hallucinatory drug or something . All the doctors are flippo now . They spend their time cooking up things like that . I mean maybe the maid slipped it into her rum . " " Come on , love bucket . " " No , the maid was in cahoots . " " Angel Bettina ... " " I know something you do n't know . Deborah never told you anything . You know why I was her best friend ? Because no matter what she told me , nobody ever believed it . And besides , I know something about that maid . "  | " What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That maid is Barney Kelly 's mistress . You know the kind a man his age has . They always have those thin lips which can go any-where . " " Now why would Barney Kelly be so interested in what Deborah was doing that he would give up such a mistress ? " " All I know is the maid came as a condition of Deborah 's al-lowance . " " She did n't have one . " " Kelly gave Deborah five hundred dollars a week . Did you think you were supporting her by yourself , Horatio Alger ? " " I do n't know what to think . " " Somebody killed her . " " I really doubt it , Gigot . " " She was done in . " " I do n't think so . " " I know . " " Then go to the police . " " I 'm afraid to . " " Why ? " " Because I think there are repercussions to this . " Bettina spoke in a whisper which was quite inside her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bettina , you are mad . " " Better believe me , handsome . " ' Why in the name of heaven would Deborah be a spy ? " " Steve , she was bored . She was always bored . She 'd do anything to avoid being bored . " ' Who was she a spy for ? " ' Well , I do n't know . She was capable of anything . I once accusedher of being CIA and she laughed . Those idiots , ' she said.  |p151They  're all college professors or gorillas wearing paratroop boots . ' Anyway , I know she used to be M.I.6 . " " When ? " " When we were in the convent in London . That 's how she would get a pass to get out . She had a boy friend who was M.I.6 , anyway . " Gigot , you 're really a very silly little girl . " " And you 're a fathead . Blake 's a fathead and you 're a fathead . " " Chookey-bah , I do adore you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a Communist , " I said . " Divine lamb , that 's what I was going to tell you . I 'm willing to bet she was some kind of double agent , you know , a spy within a spy . I have something I want to tell you about that . " I groaned . There was an awful possibility that some blighted hair of truth was still alive in all of this . I could feel mysteries revolving into mysteries like galaxies forming themselves , and knew with some sort of defeated woe that I would never learn a tenth of what had really happened , not ever . " Cheese it , the cops , " whispered Bettina . " Why , Blake , " she said loudly , " you angel ape of a stud , who do you think I 'm talking to ? It 's Marguerite Ames . She 's calling me from a phone booth . Hang on , Marguerite , Blake wants to talk to you . Oh , darling , get a nickel up fast , or call me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I hung up even as I could feel him reaching for the phone . My shirt was wet . I was like a man in a burning house who has three minutes to get the valuables together . I had just those three minutes to hold myself in line , and then the desire for a drink would sear the walls . I stripped off that wet shirt I had chosen with such care , scrubbed my back and under my arms with a dry towel , put on somethingelse quick as I could find it , and stepped out the door . I did n't realize until I reached the street that I had been holding my breath . My uneasiness was almost tangible now ; I could feel somep152sullen air of calm , exactly that torporous calm which comes before a hurricane . It was nearly dark outside . I would be late , but I had to walk to the precinct , I had the conviction that if I entered a taxi there would be an accident . I turned abruptly and felt a flicker in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but intent intelligence nearby . Then I knew I was being followed . My eye picked out a man half a block back on the other side of the street who went on strolling . A detective , no doubt . That was almost pleasing . Had they been following me since I left the precinct last night ? For this interview Roberts ' office was in the basement , a box of a room ten feet by twelve with a desk , a few wooden chairs , two file cabinets and a wall calendar . There was also an enlarged map of the precinct with red pins in it . I had been led here by a policemanon duty near the desk sergeant 's tribunal , and we had gone down a flight of iron stairs and down a long corridor which gave a view through one window of the cellblock , a row of steel doors and walls of yellow institutional tile . As we went by , I could hear somebodyyelling  --  one of the drunks . Roberts did not get up to shake hands . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a walk . " " Sweating out some booze ? " " You look hung yourself . " He nodded . " I 'm not used to living with the poison . " His blue eyes , alert last night and precise as a micrometer , now seemed larger and red-rimmed and somewhat boiled  --  the blue had gone pale . As he leaned forward , a waft of exertion came off him , sour with use , and also too sweet , as if he had borrowed some ' of O'Brien 's smell . Then he opened a file . " We have the autopsy now . Yes , we got it all here , " he said , and tapped the file slowly . " It does n't look so good for you . " " Care to give detail ? " " I have enough here to lock you up . " " Why do n't you ? "  | " Probably I will . " " Maybe the time has come for me to get a lawyer . " I put no emphasis on this . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely beginning a serious game . " I 'd rather talk a while first . " ' Why ? " " You 're an intelligent man . I think you 're entitled to know how bad your situation is . I want your confession , this evening , right here . " The desire for a drink had passed . It was as if I'd'been laboring these last few hours to get myself ready to meet him . " You know , of course , " he said , " that when a body has been dead for six hours , rigor mortis sets in . " " Yes . I know that . " " Well , there was no evidence of rigor mortis on your wife when we found her on the street . " " How could there be ? " " There was n't . However , we know another way to measure the time of death . I do n't imagine you 're familiar with that . " Something in his posture told me not to answer . " Ever hear , " Roberts asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive . " ' Well , Rojack , when a death occurs , the body blood begins tocoagulate at exactly those parts of the body which are touching thefloor or leaning against a wall . That 's dependent lividity . Withinan hour and a half you can begin to see black and blue areas withthe naked eye . Now by the time the autopsy was made on yourwife , her body was covered with dependent lividity front and back . " She had been lying on her face and then I had turned her over . " Your wife was lying on her back in the street . That could possiblyaccount for the dependent lividity there , but it does n't explainwhy she had it on her cheek , her breasts , her ribs , her belly , herthighs , her kneecaps and the ends of her toes . Care to comment ? "  | " Not yet . " " This evidence by itself is enough to get you the chair "  --  his eyes looked at me bleakly as if they saw nothing but stone  --  " but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence we have . " " I 'm not guilty . So I assume there 's something wrong with your evidence . " " Point two : your wife 's hyoid bone was broken . That 's a direct sign of strangulation especially when it 's accompanied , as the autopsy shows , by massive hemorrhaging . " " There must be another reason . " " Care to offer it , Rojack ? " " You 're convinced I did it . Why go on ? " " Let me give you the alternatives : A : You talk your way out of here no worse than you came in . B : You give me a confession . C : You do n't say a thing , and I lock you up right in that cellblock over there . Tomorrow we 'll have you arraigned . " I had gone through this day on the hope I would be able to get back to Cherry tonight . If at this exact instant Roberts had offered me twenty-four hours of freedom I think I would have signed his confession , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Some dim cautiontried to argue not to say more without a lawyer , yet I could not stop here . " Roberts , " I said , " admit that if I were guilty I 'd make a phone call right now to the best criminal lawyer in town . " " I recommend that you do . " " You want me to discuss it with you , " I said , " and yet you wo n't agree I give away some advantage by disclosing a possible line of defense . " " What do you give away ? You think we ca n't think for ourselves . " He smashed his fist down on the desk . " You want to talk , " he said , " because you 're the kind of degenerate who chases every hundred-to-one shot . You want to be back on the Lower East Side with your new broad tonight . Do n't piss on me , buster . Just sitp155down and dictate a little confession and I 'll give you a night with her in a midtown hotel with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard would have their ear to the door . How much he wanted this confession . There was something wrong . He wanted my confession too quickly . I knew I should be silent , but I also knew that whatever strength I had , I certainly did not have the simple strength to sit in a cell . Talking to him , I could keep my strength ; alone , something would begin to unravel in me , I would come apart , yes , I would come apart . " I 'm waiting , " he said . " Roberts , you can always find one expert to contradict another . Deborah jumped out that window , that 's all I know . Your expert says she had to be dead before the fall . I could find an expert to explain that her dependent lividity was a direct result of the impact of striking the ground from ten stories up , and then being buffeted by the car which hit her , broke the hyoid bone in her neck , and caused a massive hemorrhaging . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over . It comes from resting in one place . When was she resting on her stomach ? " " When they put her on the stretcher . " ' What ? " " Yes , I remember thinking how unusual that was , and then realized why . The back of her head was crushed , and you know ... . You remember it was bad . . . . They did n't want her head to lie on the stretcher . " " Well , " Roberts grinned , " you missed a promising legal career . " He sat back in his chair . " I have to admit your account could take care of a few details . Conceivably . One chance in ten . I wo n't go into the technical evidence any further , but I suppose it 's possible you could find one unqualified expert to get up on your side for every ten professionals we could find . But skip that . The way wep156stand , as I follow you , is that you 're prepared to sign a statement she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , I 'll sign such a statement . " ' Well , we could take the time to get a police stenographer down here and type it up , but that would just use the next half hour , and I do n't need it , I do n't require that kind of leverage on you . The fact of the matter , Rojack , is that you still have n't heard Point Three . " " Point Three ? " " Why should I disclose a piece of evidence we can use at the trial . I mean why should I offer it to you for nothing ? " " For the same reason I 'm ready to talk openly to you . " " Stop horsing around . You give me your confession and I 'll give you room to put in anything and everything on the line of TemporaryInsanity . I 'll even give you a tip or two on the kind of material to include . But if you do n't throw in your hand , if you insist on trying to get away with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it a personal crusade to get you and get you right , get you so bad even the governor will hesitate to commute the electric chair to life . " He was breathing heavily . " That 's quite a speech , " I said . " Sit back and listen to Point Three . Your wife was alive when she went through the window . That you are ready to claim . Cor-rect ? " " Correct . " " Well , you ignored her large intestine . " ' What are you talking about ? " " Believe it or not , these details are no more agreeable to me than to anyone else , but the autopsy does show a complete evacuationof her bowels before she jumped . " " I do n't see the significance , " I said . " Strangulation results in a total relaxation of the anal sphincter . Get it ? "  | " While we were talking , Deborah went to the bathroom . " He gave me a look of disgust , as if I were a hired athlete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " that when she engaged in such activities she was not in the habit of leaving traces on her negligee . " " Those traces could have come from the fall , or been deposited afterward . Some actions continue after death . " We could have been talking about a stranger . I had a distant moment of woe as if some exorbitant price were eventually to be paid for disposing of Deborah'sprivacy this way . Roberts gave a broad happy grin . ' We gave a thorough examinationto the apartment . Particularly to her bedroom . Rojack , the carpet was soiled sufficiently for us to establish a certain fact beyond dispute . The carpet provided a laboratory sample of the same precise foreign material we 're talking about . When you explain that to my satisfaction , you can walk out of this room . " I knew which story had to be told next , but I did not know if I could tell it . " Roberts , I 'd like to keep something private about my wife . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deborah was unbalanced at the end . " " You hinting what I think you 're hinting at ? " " I ca n't go into it . " But of course I could . Some chamber of the brain had prepared this story , and I was now equipped to give it , detail upon detail , Deborah 's precise if imaginary speech , " Now that you 've seen this , there 's not much left to see , " and her body quick to the window and out in three steps ; yes , this imaginary account now had the vividness of the real . I knew if I ever stepped over into psychosis the story would accompany me in exchange . Roberts had a look of half-convinced attention , the expression he had had for a little while in Deborah 's room last night . But I could not go on . Let this story stick to Deborah , and the past would sink in like disease.  | " No , " I said , " you may as well lock me up . " His phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked . " No . " Roberts picked up the phone . " No ... no . He wo n't give it . He needs seventy-two hours . . . . What ? Son of a bitch , no . " He swore for the next twenty seconds , his eyes so full of blood I thought he was going to beat on the side of my head with the receiver . Then he put his hand to his jaw and held his chin in a grip which must have been equal to pressing a button in the machinery of himself for it served to return his control . " Wait here , " he said . " I 'll be back in a couple of minutes . " IIe was not a big man , but he padded out like an overstuffed cat at the end of a chain . Roberts had left his file on the desk . I took a quick look . He did not have a report of the autopsy , he had notes on the autopsy , and while I did not understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been telling me the truth : the medical report was qualified  --  so far as I could understand his notes , the suicide was in doubt , but so was any certainty that Deborah had been dead before the fall . Only the traces on the carpet stood out  --  someone had used red ink to underline . And there were tear sheets from an article by me which he had taken from a professional journal , the text of a Prize Lecture I had given at the university my first year there , the first year I had been married to Deborah . Now like an old maid 's faded flower in a Bible were the faded words of this lecture . Reading them in this room with the radiator hissing irritably at my back , looking at the walls , that dirty weathered color of a bleached cigar , I had a quick grasp of the secret to sanity  --  it had become the ability to hold the maximum of impossible combinations in one 's mind , Roberts ' red pins on the precinct map and a paragraph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : On the Primitive View of Mystery.  |p159In  contrast to the civilized view which elevates man above the animals , the primitive had an instinctive belief that he was subservient to the primal pact between the beasts of the jungle and the beast of mystery . To the savage , dread was the natural result of any invasion of the supernatural : if man wished to steal the secrets of the gods , it was only to be supposed that the gods would defend themselves and destroy whichever man came too close . By this logic , civilization is the successful if imperfect theft of some cluster of these secrets , and the price we have paid is to accelerate our private sense of some enormous if not quite definable disasterwhich awaits us . It was a lecture which proved agreeable and had been reprinted in a monthly magazine  --  revised , enlarged , and in two parts  --  there had been I suppose something pleasantly meretricious in the sonorityof the style . Now , reading it back to myself , it revolved into my ear with the force of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be back as if some determination to resist him might be lost if I remained alone too long in the stale air of this room . So , forcing myself to concentrate on the file , I saw it was almost by chance this lecture had been deposited here , for the portfolio held a scattering of a few of the things I had written , plus gossip columns in which my name appeared , even a criticism or two of the televisionshow , a loose collection which Roberts must have looked over with half an eye . Then I could hear his step in the hall , and got back to my seat . He came in whistling . It was the cool controlled whistling of a man who has a boil on his neck . " Well , Rojack , " he said , showing his upper teeth in a smile , " you 're free of suspicion . Let 's go out and have a beer . " His eyes were a void . " I knew , " he said , " I knew there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What are you telling me ? " " The official medical report came in . Suicide . Yes . " He nodded . " You have a big brother somewhere . "  |p160I  felt as if I had to begin asking questions , or I would give myselfaway . " Is that why you wanted my confession in such a hurry ? " I asked . " I could just as soon have waited . It was Leznicki 's idea to put the screws to you . " With each breath Roberts was becoming more genial . It was as if we 'd been wrestlers and Roberts had proceededon the assumption it was his night to win . Then the referee had whispered in his ear  --  his turn to lose . So he bulled around the ring . Now we were back in the dressing room exchanging anecdotes , trading apologies . " But you got word last night to let me go ? " " Let 's say we took a hint . I was for letting you go anyway  --  I figured you 'd be interesting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I 'd give a lot , Rojack , to know how much you really know . " " I do n't know very much . " " Dad , you drive me to drink . " " Did you think if you got a confession from me you could stand up to the pressure ? " He had never looked more like a cop . The dedication of his short straight nose hung above the confirmed grin of corruption at the corner of his mouth . Rectitude , cynicism , and greed threw off separateglints from his eyes . ' Well , we did n't know , " he said . " Maybe we could take the pressure , maybe we would have had to swap you off for something else . But a confession would have been interesting . " He gave the leathery smile of a baseball manager who has lost a rookie he might have developed or sent back to the minors on a trade . " Do n't worry about police politics , " he said . ' We could talk about it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'd like to listen . " " What do you want , a winning ticket on a lottery ? Settle for a beer . "  |p161I  smiled . " I 'm on the wagon for another hour . " I stood up . " It 's been a pleasure knowing you , Roberts . " He grinned again , " If you were n't such a big man , I 'd say , Keep your nose clean . " " I 'm not a big man . " He looked worried , as if it might be a mistake to ask the next question . " Listen , " he said finally when I was at the door , " if you answer something for me , I think I could offer you something in return . " " Let 's hear your question . " " Rojack , are you CIA ? " " I ca n't tell you something like that . " " All right , take this for nothing . Maybe you know it already . We had Eddie Ganucci on a technicality . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my feeling is it came from the same place yours did . " " Do you know for certain ? " " I do n't . Pressure never has a name on it . " " You 're not stupid , are you , Roberts ? " " I was a good FBI man once upon a time . " He rapped me on the back . " Keep your end up . " It had turned cold outside . I passed a bar and then another bar . I had no idea whether to celebrate or run for cover . At a corner telephone booth I stopped and made a call to my answer service . They had reached Mr. Kelly 's secretary and now had a message : Mr. Kelly would see me at midnight . " Call back , Gloria , and tell them 1 ' 11 try to be there , " I said . " I do n't know if we 're supposed to give this service as a regular thing , Mr. Rojack . " " Gloria , just for today , " I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all came over me , wavep162after wave , dangerous waves as though pilings were riding through the water , and smashing the shore . The wind was up . Each time I closed the cab window the air from the heater was foul , a bad exhausthad seeped in . But with the glass rolled down , I could hear the wind too well , and it had the long ripping sound of a voracious wind at sea which tears off the water and snatches at the roots of the grass . There was some break in the heavens tonight : a siren was blowing , an attention was present , I could all but sniff the sour rot of clotting blood in the pits of this wind . And I lay back on my seat and felt something close to nausea because mystery revolved about me now , and I did not know if it was hard precise mystery with a detailed solution , or a mystery fathered by the collision of larger mysteries , something so hopeless to determine as the edge of a cloud , or could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something between the two , some hopeless no-man's-land from which nothing could return but exhaustion ? And I had a sudden hatred of mystery , a moment when I wanted to be in a cell , my life burned down to the bare lines of a legal defense . I did not want to see Barney Oswald Kelly later tonight , and yet I knew I must for that was part of the contract I had made on the morning air . I would not be permitted to flee the mystery . I was close to prayer then , I was very close , for what was prayer but a beseechment not to pursue the mystery , " God , " I wanted to pray , " let me love that girl , and become a father , and try to be a good man , and do some decent work . Yes , God , " I was close to begging , " do not make me go back and back again to the charnel house of the moon . " But like a soldier on sixhourleave to a canteen , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaped a whiff of the trenches , I could hear Deborah in rut , burningrubber and a wild boar , some voice almost slipped into me on the wind , that high wind  --  from whose summit did it derive ?  --  and then the cab pulled up at Cherry 's street , and with a beating heart , I walked up all those sordid defeat-infested stairs , and knocked on her door , and knew in the instant I heard no sound of stirring thatp163stronger than my fear was the other fear she might not be there . Then I heard her move , the door opened , we embraced . " Oh , honey , " she said , " Something is bad tonight . " We embraced again , and I led her to the bed . We sat down beside each other and touched fingertips . That made me feel good for the first time since I went out the door this afternoon . Relief came over me like a winner 's victorious sleep . " Do you want a drink ? " she asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cherry said . " Yes . I love you . " She had rested . The exhaustion was out of her face and she looked like a seventeen year old . " Were you ever a cheer leader ? " I asked . " I think I was kind of funny-looking in high school . " " Even by your senior year ? " " No , I was getting there then . The captain of the football team spent a whole year trying to take my dear name away from me . " " But you managed to keep it ? " " I did n't . " Suddenly we laughed at each other . " How come no one ever ate you alive ? " I said . " Oh , they tried , mister , they sure did try . " And she gave me a kiss like the kiss last night in the bar , but the iron was out of it , some of the iron , and I smelled the honeysuckle which had lived on the air one hot June night long ago in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , " I said , " let 's go back to this morning . " We did . Somewhere in the middle , born out of fatigue and tension and the exhaustion of every lie I had told today , like a gift I did not deserve , that new life began again in Inc , sweet and perilousand so hard to follow , and I went up with it and leaped and flew over , vaulting down the fall to those washed-out roses washed by the tears of the sea , they washed out to me as my life went in ,  |p165and  I met one cornucopia of flesh and sorrow , scalding sorrow , those wings were in the room , clear and delicate as a noble intent , that sweet presence spoke of the meaning of love for those who had betrayed it , yes I understood the meaning and said , for I knew it now , " I think we have to be good , " by which I meant we would have to be brave . " I know , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , " she said again . " You sure ? " I asked . I put my foot onto hers , " you really sure ? " " Yes , I 'm sure . " " Do n't you know what Broadway says ? " " What does Broadway say ? " " Why , Shit , senorita , ' says Broadway . " " Oh , Lordy . Oh , Lordy ! You 're such fucking sugar , " she said , and bent over and kissed my toe.  |p165I  LAY THERE , content to touch the tip of a finger to the tip of a breast , and had that knowledge which falls like rain , for now I understood that love was not a gift but a vow . Only the brave could live with it for more than a little while . So then I thought of Deborah and those nights years ago when I lay beside her with a love somewhat different , but 1 had had a hint of this before , had it with Deborah , had it with others , girls I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trains were going in opposite directions . Sometimes with women I had seen for many a month I might have found it on one particular night at the bottom of a barrel of booze . It had always been the same , love was love , one could find it with anyone , one could find it anywhere . It was just that you could never keep it . Not unless you were ready to die for it , dear friend . Well , I went back to that embrace with Cherry . We were done , an-4 yet we were not done , for we had a moment when we touchedp166and met the way a bird might light on an evening sea , and we floated off with the tide , deep in each other as the long wash of memory late at night . I could not keep from holding her  --  had flesh ever promised to forgive me so ? I put my hand on her waist : some offer rose from her breast and took my hand . I sat up in bed , bent forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to examine now , those toes I disliked so much , the short broad shape of the instep , the calluses , the sole . Her foot gave promise of traveling in its own direction , and yet I embraced it , I gripped her foot as if to say , " You 're coming with me . " That foot had a mind to hear my thought , it warmed my hand like a small dog with a stout heart . Then I looked up from those toes , across all the shades of her body up to the subtle hints of lavender and silver in the shadows of her face and smiled happily and said , " Do you think we 're allowed a drink ? " She brought out the bottle , and we drank slowly , I do not suppose I had taken my liquor sip by sip since I could remember . It seemed enough to drop some ice into a tumbler , pour a quarterinchof alcohol down a cube and watch the current as the whiskey gave up its gold to the water . Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chair , the brass handle at the top of the faucet on the kitchen sink , the chewed tassels of the lampshade  --  seemedto stand about us like sentinels possessing some primitive property of radio , as if they would be the first to inform us of a visitor on the stair . I was telling her about my television show  --  it was now somehow a part of what we talked about when we met on the street , and so I went on about it , but in fact it was agreeable to hold off the moment when we came to talk about ourselves ; therefore it was almost agreeable to think about the show . We had begun by being an avant-garde circus : interviews with bearded studs who had been smoking marijuana for twenty-two years , confessions by ex-criminals about homosexuality in the prisons , a lecture by myself on " Picasso and His Pistol " ( a homemade studyp167of Picasso as Master of Ceremonies to the cannibalistic urge of modern Europe  --  the most difficult lecture in the history of television ) , a chat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motorcycle gang , with the leader of a gang in Harlem , with a housewife who lost one hundred and eighty pounds in a year , with an unfrocked priest , with a failed suicide ( a girl , three scars on the wrist ) . I had had an idea in the beginning , I assured her , I wanted to clear a path through psychoanalysis and social welfare . " You 're just bright , " she said . And took a nip of skin from my ear in a bite so neat and small a toothpick could have pricked me . " Remember , " she said , putting a pearl of saliva on my ear for balm , " that review Mac N. Ryan wrote : This is a carnival of bad taste which violates the canons of dignity television has achieved . ' " She laughed at the sounds . " You know I went out on a date with Mac N. Ryan once . " " He violate any canons ? " " Oh , he hated to leave me unloved , but did I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , you know , honey , syphilis is on the up and up . ' That did his little thing in . I had to put him in a cab . " I laughed . Something dull in the bruise was gone . Poor Mac N. Ryan . With his honorable exception , the television critics had ignored the show . We were always losing sponsors and finding worse ones , the FCC was daily on the phone , the producer ( you have met him ) was on tranquilizers , and I was just not good enough . The guests became professional men , officials , professors , purveyors , we discussed books and current events  --  we dwindled into popularity . I told her a little of all that , and made some attempt to sketch the past ( truly , I wanted her to know a little about me ) I told her about my academic career , I was proud of that for once done with politics , I had gone to graduate school in the Midwest and in five years had picked up a doctorate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years later , back in New York , I had made full professor ( the Clark Reed Powell Lecture ) . It camep168out of course in no formal way , story here , anecdote there , our mood drifted with the indolence of boats on a harbor swell , lifting down the spine of each small wave . " Let 's eat , " she said at last , and got out of bed to cook us two small steaks , a bit of spaghetti , scrambled eggs . We ate  --  I fell on the food , I had lost all sense of how hungry I was  --  and when we were done , over the coffee and the new cigarettes , it seemed her turn to speak . Sitting at the table , her wheat-colored wrapper gathered about her ( while I was offered a robe which must once have belonged to Shago Martin ) , I listened to Cherry talk about herself . She had been raised by her half-brother and half-sister . I remembered that . Her half-brother was eighteen the year her parents were killed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was four , her little sister was a year . Her older brother was admired by the neighbors because he worked at two jobs . He worked hard , he kept the family together . " There was just one tiny flaw , " said Cherry . " Brother was stickingit into sister every night . " She shook her head . " I used to hear my mother and father talking to me on the way from school . Tell big brother to stop his silliness , ' they would say . And when I got to be eight and ten , I came to know that people in town were on to what was going on . But it did n't seem to hurt our hardasslittle respectability . I used to play in the other girls ' backyards and once in a while they 'd come to mine . And my brother was on the way to being a reasonable success in town . It was n't that he liked little sis and me . He sort of disliked us . But he knew what it could do to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden at eighteen . I mean he thought that way . Even before he was eighteen , he had big jaws , and a cigar stuck in them . " " What does he do now ? " " Sheriff . Last I heard he was running for State Legislature . I was tempted to send him a photograph of Shago and me . " She looked away for a moment as if Shago had become real to herp169again . " Well , " Cherry said , " anyway , we pretended we had kept our family secret , and were as nice as anybody --  I mean we all rune from good Southern families , all six hundred of us . In a tcnvu that size , all you need to be good family is to have a rich great-uncle you 've never seen and be rich enough yourself to bring the outhouse into the house , but "  --  she took a sip of her coffee  --  " big brother went off and got married , and that left big sis to take care . And she went potty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man  --  she was doing it for quarters and dimes  --  which left little sis and me disreputable . They still admired my brother  --  I guess all that incest taught him how to move politically  --  but my sisters and me were to be ostracized . I used to go to school by myself , come home by myself . Finally we had to leave town with big sis . " They went to live in Georgia , they went to live in northern Florida , the older sister got married , Cherry went through high school living in the home of a brother-in-law who was made progressively more nervous by her presence . Finally she had to leave her sister . She finished high school . sleeping in a rooming house , working as a waitress . " And of course , " said Cherry , " I hung around the juke spots and cheapholenightclubs cause I had a bouncy little back-country voice and wanted to be a singer . That was the year I was so nice on that football star , but he decided to go away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I used to feel about the way you feel in a dream once you start to wake up . I guess incest brings back the dead . " She said this with such a finality of tone , such-a dry old lady certain of her tonics and recipes , that I had no notion if it were her own idea , or a piece of folklore the village idiot could talk over with the town 's first banker . " Well , next I had a short stretch of young girl 's bliss  --  a Navy flier . We were going to get married . Only it turned out he was married already . Crash . Then I met Daddy Warbucks , " she said , and stopped . " Sure I should go on ? " " Yes . " I wanted to know more.  |p170'Well  , I lived with a rich man for a time . A rich older man . That 's the quick of it . He picked me out in a nightclub  --  he was a businessman passing through  --  and , well , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to the next town . " " Yes . " " I stayed for several years . He was considerably older than me , but ... " " But what ? " " It was kind of carnal , beloved . " We had a profit to spend . It was what we had gained from that last hour  --  so she would tell me the truth . If finally I could not bear to hear it , then , said her face , we had not deserved the profit . " Yes , " I said . " Carnal . " " The trouble is , " said Cherry , " I hardly saw him . He would install me in some pleasant apartment in some city or other , and then I might not see him for a week . I would get the impression he had been across the country back and forth three times . " " Did n't you mind being alone ? " " No , I 'd find the best singing coach around . And I did a lot of reading . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a delight to talk to him . So long as I thought he was just a rich intelligent man with a family somewhere , it was all right . But one day I saw his picture in a news magazine , and realized he had not even told me his real name . I was ready to leave him then . But he convinced me to come with him to Vegas . He said if I were willing to live there , we could be together in public . So then I dug . Because in Vegas I naturally came to meet a few of his friends , and  --  click  --  , they were the big dogs of the Mafia . " " He was in the Mob ? " " He was wealthy . A very respectable man . He liked to gamble . Sometimes I would believe we were in town just for that . SometimesI would come to the conclusion he might own some of Las Vegas . Because now when he would leave me for a week or often ..  |p171enough  a month  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . And that did not figure if he was simply a rich man who 'd left his young lady behind . So I had to think I was either too unattractiveto draw anybody near me , or Daddy was some special big dog . But very special . He was obviously not the type to be in the Mob , not in any way directly . You want some more coffee ? " " I 'm fine . " " I guess I am too . " She had been stopping at odd times in her account . There had been several pauses when she told me about her brother , and now there was one again . " Of course , there 's always been an argument , " Cherry went on , " about The Big Guy . ' Does he exist or does n't he ? You could have two big-time hoods discussing this , brother peas in the pod right down to the same number of carats in the diamond on their tiepin , but one would say , The Big Guy do n't exist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross himself . " " What did you decide ? " " I do n't know . Sometimes I used to think Daddy Warbucks could be The Big Guy , nothing less . Then I would decide that was too farfetched . " " What would you say today ? " " I think he was n't Mob at all . But the Mob did very special jobs for him . Very large intricate jobs . Some of it was overseas . I had that impression . " Another of her pauses came here . " And then , " she said finally , " I was n't sure I wanted to know too much . Because there came a time when I wanted to get free of this man , and I did n't know how to do it . He was n't the kind who would threaten or any of that discord , but I knew I 'd get mangled on the way out , and the question was how badly . " She came to a full stop . " Well , we parted as friends . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to an acquaintance  --  with my consent . I figured this was the way to pay my dues . So I got the friend  --  the king of narcotics in L.A. I foundp172out two days later . The friend had secret inclinations which could blast you to the moon . And he did threaten to kill me when I told him it would n't go . I got my guts together for that one . I finally stood up to somebody , even to even . Better not , ' I told the gentleman , or I 'll make it a point to haunt you . ' These Mafiosos are superstitious as a witch . I had said the right thing . Only I did n't know it then . I could n't sleep for the next two months waiting for the door to open . But at least I had the sense to stay where I was in town . One of the smartest men I knew once said , Flee from a knife , but charge a gun , ' and this narcotics gent was strictly a pistol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd have gotten it in the back  --  which is a poor position from which to go out , for it makes the haunting less impressive . " " What a pro you are . " " Better believe it . " " No , I 'm impressed . " " I was just a dry leaf waiting to fall off the tree . But I had good luck . So I was able to get myself together . Then I began to break in with singing dates in Vegas  --  because of my previous associationsI had cartel  --  and I had a couple of nice years . I only went with men I liked , and there were a few I spent some time with , a couple of Italians with class whom I just did manage to find . Hoods , but I liked them . Italians are all so treacherous I used to feel virtuous next to them . " Pause . " But then I knew it was time to get to New York . " " Why ? " " Some day I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She pursed her mouth as though adding a bill . " I 'd picked up power in Vegas I did n't deserve . I did n't know what to do with it . Nobody in the Mob knows how much anybody else knows . In fact nobody knows how much he knows himself . So considering the men I traveled with , other people I hardly knew were ready to dop173favors . They thought I was more important than I was , and that helped to make me just a bit important . It 's not exactly cool to brag on this , but I had the power to get people killed . It also occurred to me I could get killed myself , and this time I would n't know what for or who . It did n't put itself together . I may have been greedy , but I was full of scarcity  --  know what I mean ? I grew up in a stingy town . When the food got too rich , I felt just like a skinny little Southern girl all over again . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she always felt as if she had a small angel accompanying her . All orphans did  --  that was part of the economy of nature . And for companion , the angel had a whore , because the two got along with each other . " I mean , " said Cherry , " the tart would have herself a fling and the angel would say , That 's okay , honey , you 're entitled to a bit of fun after all that misery . ' " But in Vegas , the angel became an asset , it kept drawing people in . " I 've always been independent , " Cherry said , " or at least I like to think so . I believe there 's a side of me does n't want anything from anybody , and maybe that 's what those hoodlums liked . But then the other side of my character was swelling up like a frog  --  I was becoming as bad and evil as a colored madam . I was ready to make that angel hustle . " She looked wistful as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to keep an eye on my killer . There was a crazy killer right inside . " " For certain ? " " Honest-to-God killer . " " Maybe you borrowed him from your friends . " " I 'll never know , " she said . " ' I'hc ugly fact , if I was to trace it out , is that one or two men in Vegas are probably dead because of me . They were at the other end of a string , but I was vindictive enough about them to have been the one who pulled the string . I started thinking of that small-town hatred I had always consideredbeneath me , that envy and spite , and it was now a partp174of me . I came to the conclusion I 'd flip out so far I 'd not come back if I stayed in Vegas too long . So I decided it was the year for New York . " " Did the angel bring you to Shago Martin ? " " No , " she said , and then , " Yes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sister . " Well , look how nice you are now , " I said . " I 'm a spirit now , " she said , and gave a tough sensuous grin full of her flesh . " I should have had you on my program . " " I could have set it straight . I would have told America some people got souls , and some are spirits . " " I 'm sure . " " People with souls are the ones who make the world move , " she said in her Southern voice , the accent becime as thin and preciseas any little old Southern Baptist lady , " and if they fail , but honorably , why then , God , as a mercy , or as a compromise , may it be , takes their soul away and makes them a spirit . That 's a sad thing to be because you ca n't live with other spirits  --  too sad . So you have to look for somebody with soul even if they 're mean and awful . " " Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a sick old man who never had any class . " " But the ones who have class are afraid of him ? " " Yes . " She nodded several times . " Maybe that 's another reason I left . It 's not good to be around men who stand up most of the time , but know there 's one thing they never stand up to . " She gave a radiant smile . " I was sure you were going to back off from Romeo last night . " " I was so far gone I did n't care if he beat me to death . " " You were better than that . " " Did Shago teach you how to sing ? " I asked . " He taught me a little bit . But I 'm a lousy singer , I fear . " Thatp175ended conversation about Shago . She stretched her arms and yawned prettily . I was very relaxed . Somehow I had been prepared for something worse in her story . So the mood was settling in again . Soon we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steve ? " asked Cherry . " Yes ? " " Did you kill your wife ? " " Yes . " " Yes , " she said . " You 're a cunning little cutie . " " No , baby , I knew you did it . Oh God . " " How did you know ? " I asked . " I saw a man once just after he came back from a killing . You looked like he did . " " How did he look ? " " Like he 'd been painted with a touch of magic . " Her face crumpled . " I was hoping I was wrong , " she said , " but I knew I was n't . Oh , I hope it 's not too late for us . " " Yes . " " I 'm afraid . " " I am a little myself . " " Do you have to be somewhere tonight ? " she asked . I nodded . " Who is it you 're going to see ? " " Deborah 's father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know his name ? " " I read the papers today . " But I could feel her receding from me . There had been something wrong with what she said . " You 've heard of him before this ? " A look came into her face . We had the longest pause . It went on so long I could hear a ringing in the air.  | " Stephen , " she said , " I used to know Kelly . " " You did ? " " He was the man who took me to Vegas . " I had a repetition of that vision in Ruta 's bed , of that city in the desert with its lights burning in the dawn . " I do n't want to talk any more about it , " she said . And as if revelation had stripped her naked , the wheat-colored wrapper came slowly apart , it opened with a grave movement . " How the hell could you ? " I broke out . " He 's an attractive man . " " He 's odious . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't . In fact , he was n't . It was different than that . I felt as if Kelly and I were running in the same blood . And that sensation of not belonging to myself , of being owned at my center by Deborah  --  that emotion which had come on me not five minutes before I killed her  --  now came back . I felt murder . It frightened me . The possibility that what I felt , when we made love , was a sensationwhich belonged to me alone , left me murderous . For how did one distinguish love from the art of the Devil ? But then like a child , I said to myself , " The Devil has no wings . " Those roses which washed from the sea , that angel which went by the room . . . " Do you think we made a child this morning ? " " Yes . " There was no quiver in the air . If she were lying I was blind to the point of death , or she was a perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back to me . " Is it a boy or a girl ? " " I 'll tell you one thing , mister , " she said , " it 's a boy or a girl . " But there were operations we must get through . I had a lover 's practical savagery . " Let 's go into all of it , " I said . ' We did . " " There 's more . " I saw her temper rising , a flash of that sun-tanned sensual pridep177with which she had sung her set last night . But something humble took her over . " All right , " she said . " You ever pregnant before ? " " Yes . " " Kelly ? " " Yes . " " What happened to the child ? " " I did n't have it . " " Any other time ? " She was silent . " Shago Martin ? " " Yes . " " Afraid to have it ? " " Shago was afraid to have it . " " How long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Three months ago . And last week I broke up with him . " Once , in a rainstorm , I witnessed the creation of a rivulet . The water had come down , the stream had begun in a hollow of earth the size of a leaf . Then it filled and began to flow . The rivulet rolled down the hill between some stalks of grass and weed , it moved in spurts , down the fall of a ledge , down to a brook . It did not know it was not a river . That was how the tears went down Cherry 's face . They began in some tight knurled pit of grief , some bitter hollow , rose to her eyes , flowed down her face , dripped to her open breast , fell to her thigh , and collected in the grove  --  a teaspoon full of ten years ' sorrow . " You see , " she said , and now she began to weep , " I thought I could never have a child . The doctor Kelly sent me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out . I just never got pregnant all those years . And then with Shago I did . He turned on me . He said I was a white devil  --  after all the time we spent together . " " And you did n't want to have it by yourself ? "  | " I did n't have the guts . You see , I had cheated on him . " " With Tony ? " " Yes . " " Why ? " " Habit , I guess . " " Habit , hell . Why with Tony ? What does he have ? " She shook her head . She seemed almost in pain " There 's somethingsweet in Tony , believe it . " " How can I ? " " I was aching so . Shago can be evil . " That did it . She put her head on the table , and gave herself up to grief . I stroked her hair . It had been fine hair once , but hairdresser'stint had roughened the silk . As she wept I heard an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made as she talked . " Lordy , Lordy , " she said at last , brought her head up and tried to smile . She had that look of naked relaxation which is shared by sex , grief , and the end of huge physical exertion . " Give me a cigarette , " she said . I lit it for her . " How about me ? " I asked . I was not far from a child with my desire for an answer . " Do I manage to kiss the bruise ? Is that what my sweet rep is ? " " Do n't talk too much . " " I want to know . " " Something happened with you , " she said . " What happened ? " She shook her head . " Why do you insist ? It 's bad luck to go on . But you insist . So , listen , Stephen , you can have it , it happened with you . I had an orgasm with you . I was never able to before . Now , pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hint of gloom to her remark , as if it had happened with the wrong man at the wrong time . " What do you mean , never ? " I asked  --  the need was to make her repeat it.  | " Never before . Every other way , yes . But never , Stephen , when a man was within me , when a man was right inside of me . " " All those years ? " " Never . " " Christ almighty . " " I swear . " " Can I believe you ? " " Yes , you can . Because I always had the feeling once it happenedI would soon be dead . I know that 's special and doubtless very crazy of me , but that 's been my little fear . " " And now you do n't have it ? " " I do n't know if I have it , or lost it , or what . All I know is I 'm happy . Now , hush , stop trying to spoil it . " There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not warned us after all . The rap beat out a tricky little rhythm , as weighted inside as a drummer 's tattoo on the rim of his snare . Cherry looked across the table at me with a face from which all expression was gone . " That 's Shago , " she said . A key turned in one of the tumblers , then the other . The door came open . An elegant Negro with a skin dark as midnight was standing there . He looked at the robe I was wearing . " All right , " he said to me , " get dressed . Get your white ass out of here . "  |p180I  HAD SEEN Shago Martin in the final reel of a movie about some jazz musicians , and his photograph on slip jackets for his records  --  a handsome face , thin and arrogant , a mask . I had even gone on caravan once with Deborah to the Latin Quarter or the Copacabana , a rare excursion for the lady since there was nothing she found more unsettling than a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her friends had come to watch . " He 's the most attractive man in America , " she told me when he went on . " What do you mean , most attractive ' ? " I asked . I was doing my best to be a young Harvard banker in from Boston for the night . " Shago , " Deborah said , " comes from one of the worst gangs in Harlem . I think you see it in his walk . There 's something about him independent , something very fine . " " He sounds loud enough to me. "  | " Well , " said Deborah , " he may be loud at times , but there are people who can hear what he is saying . " There were few matters in which Deborah was bloody ; music was one of them  --  she did not know bugger from beans  --  1 had decidedlong ago that Shago was the most talented singer in America . Whereas Deborah and her friends had come to him lately . They had always repected him , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never respected him thus famously ; now the roulette of fashion came up double-zero : Shago was in . They were enchantedthat he was oblivious to fashion ; or at least oblivious to the shift in taste which made him fashionable this season in New York . He was singing only at the Copa and Latin Quarter these days  --  any other season this would have disqualified him forever  --  butnow since it proved impossible to invite or attract him to the parties which made up the inner schedule of the season each week , everyone 's desire for such an evening took on the proportions of a frontier war . Deborah and I were present that night because Deborah had stalked him ( by telephone ) into the promise to give an interview after his eleven o'clock set : she was going to hog him to a contract to sing at a charity ball coming up in four weeks and three days . But Shago was not in his dressing room when the set was over ; he had left a note with his valet : Sorry , lady , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , dear , " said Deborah , " the poor man must be trying to spell shit . " She was , however , livid .. The world was now more defined . In return for this raid on good feelings , Deborah got Shago good . I never knew how many phone calls it took , nor how many looks were dropped on how many marble floors : " Do you really like the man ? " but in four weeks and three days , by the night of the charity ball , no hostess I knew was keening for Shago . That was that . There was a base to Deborah 's humor which smelled of old brass . I used thereafter to keep his records , and I would play them . Actually , I did not enjoy him altogether . 1 lis talent was too extreme.  |p182He  was not often evocative of the smell of smoke in a fog or the mood which is near a young girl when she comes into a room , he did not suggest that the nicest affair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make me think , as other singers often did , of landscapes in Jamaica , of mangoes , honey , and a breast beneath a moon , of tropical love and candy which went from dark to dawn , no , Shago gave you that , he gave you some of that , but there were snakes in his tropical garden , and a wild pig was off in the wilderness with a rip in its flank from the teeth of a puma , he gave you a world of odd wild cries , and imprisoned it to something complex in his style , some irony , some sense of control , some sense of the way everything is brought back at last under control . And he had a beat which went right through your ear into your body , it was cruel , it was perfect , it gave promise of teaching a paralytic to walk : he was always announcedat places like the Copa as " The Big Beat in Show Biz , " and the worst was that some publicity man was right for once , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball off a stone floor , listening to him was cousin to the afternoon one played a match with a champion at squash  --  the ball went by with the nicest economy , picking up speed as it went , taking off as it blew by ; so Shago Martin 's beat was always harder , faster , or a hesitation slower than the reflex of your ear , but you were glowing when he was done , the ear felt good , you had been dominated by a champion . The only difficulty was that his talent persisted in shifting . Deborah began to dance with spiritual delight at some of his later records . " You know , I despise that man , " she would say , " but his music is improving . " She was right . His voice had developed to the point where you could not always distinguish it from a trumpet or even on virtuoso occasions from a saxophone . Once off on a ride , his song seemed able to take a step between each step of the rapid elegant dance a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course he had become too special  --  no average nightclub audience could follow him . He was harsh . Some of his most experimentalp183work sounded at first like a clash of hysterias . It was only later that one discovered his power of choice  --  he was like a mind racing between separate madnesses , like a car picking its route through the collision of other cars . It was harsh . The last I heard he was even singing at times in the kind of cabaret which closes on the fatal Thursday night when there is not enough in the cash register to pay the police their weekly protection . That was what delighted Deborah . That was what she heard finally in his music : he was no longer in danger of developing into a national figure . Now , as he stood inside Cherry 's door , he was wearing a small black felt hat with a narrow brim , his gray flannel suit had narrow pants , he wore short boots of some new and extraordinary cut ( red-wine suede with buttons of mother-of-pearl ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink silk took light from the vest , even as a crystal glass picks up an echo in the color of the wine , and his tie was narrow , black knit , with a small pin . With his left hand he held a furled umbrella , taut as a sword in its case , and he kept it at an angle to his body , which returned  --  since his body was tall and slim  --  some perfect recollection of a lord of Harlem standing at his street corner . This was a fair sum to notice in the time it took him to open the door , come in , look at Cherry , look at me , see his bathrobe on my back , and tell me to get dressed and out , but I saw it all , my sense of time  --  like that hesitation before the roller coaster drops  --  was as long as the first breath of marijuana when the lung gives up its long sigh within , and time goes back to that place where it began , yes , I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deborah reading the note , I had one very long instant indeed as he looked at me . A wind came off him , a poisonous snake of mood which entered my lungs like marijuana , and time began to slow . Then a curious happiness came to me from the knowledge Shago was capable of murder , as if death right now would carry me over just that moment I had known in Cherry when something went upp184and into the fall . So I smiled at him , no more , and pushed a pack of cigarettes in his direction . " Get out , " he said . Our eyes met and stayed together . There was an even raw gaze in his which stung like salt on the surface of my eyes . But I felt damnably abstract , as if my reaction had been packed away , were instruments in a case . When I did n't move , Shago turned to Cherry and said , " He wo n't run ? " " No . " " I be damn , " said Shago , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . " " Not like Tony ? " " No . " " Well , stand ! you mother-fucker , " said Shago to me . When I stood up , Martin opened his fingers . He had been holding a switchblade in his right hand , and it opened from his palm like a snake 's tongue . The flick of the blade made no more sound than a stalk of grass being pulled from its root . " I 'll tell you , " said Shago , " get dressed . I would not like , " he went on , " to get cut while I was wearing another man 's robe . " " Put away your blade , " I said . My voice spoke out of that calm . " I put it away , man , after I cut my initials on you . That 's S. M. Shit on Mother , " said Shago . He turned his head to Cherry , his eyes a startling golden yellow in his black face , they were nearly a match to hers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " shee-it , shee-it , " and he held up the blade and flicked it closed . Like a magician . " She 's my honey , " he said to me , " she my wife . " " Was your wife , " said Cherry , " till you were so evil . " " Well , shit a pickle , " said Shago . " Yeah , " she said , " shit a pickle . " They were like a man and woman balancing on a tight wire.  | " Evil , " he cried out , " evil , " he demanded , " listen , Sambo , " he said to me , " you look like a coonass blackass nigger jackaboo to me cause you been put-putting with blondie here , my wife , you see , dig ? digaree ? Evil ! Evil ? Why the white girl 's evil , you see . " There was a tiny froth at the corner of his immaculate lips , a strain of red in the white of his eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , " he 's fat . " " He 's not , " cried Cherry , " he 's not . " " Keep wasting , " said Shago , " he 's a tub of guts . " " Just go on talking , " I said . " You say that ? " he asked of me . " Yes , I said that . " My voice was not as good the second time . " Do n't cut me , boy , " said Shago . The blade was out again . " You 're a disgrace , " said Cherry . " Every nigger 's a disgrace . Look at Sambo here . He 's a disgrace to the fat white race . What you doing with him ? Why he 's a professor , he 's a professor . He hugged his wife so hard she fell down dead . Ha , ha . Ho , ho . Then he push her out . " " Close your knife , " said Cherry . " Shee-it . " " There 's bird on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit . " He took his umbrella and flipped it behind him to the door . It made a muffled sound like a woman thrust aside . " Her womb is full of blood , " he said to me . " She had a kid and afraid to have it . Afraid to have a kid with a black ass . What about you , uncle , going to give a kid with a white ass , with a white diarrhetic old ass ? Kiss my you-know-what . " " Shut up , " I said . " Get my knife , shit-face . " I took a step toward him . I did not know what I was going to do , but it felt right to take that step . Maybe I had a thought to pick up the whiskey bottle , and break it on the table . The feeling of joy came up in me again the way the lyric of a song might remind ap186man on the edge of insanity that soon he will be insane again and there is a world there more interesting than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held out in his open palm , his wrist dipping to some beat he heard in the mood . Looking at that blade was like standing on the edge of a high cliff , one 's stomach sucking out of one , as one 's eyes went down the fall . I had a moment when I remembered the German with the bayonet , and my legs were gone , they were all but gone ; I felt a voice in me sending instructions to snatch the whiskey bottle and break it , break it now that he was out of reach and so could not slash me with the knife , not without taking a step , but the voice was like a false voice in my nerves , and so I ignored it and took another step forward against all the lack of will in my legs , took the step and left the bottle behind as if I knew it would be useless against a knife . My reflexes were never a match for his . What I felt instead was an emptiness in his mood which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blade . ' Well , Cherry , " he said in a cool voice , " this cat 's got valor , " giving a Spanish pronunciation to the word . Then he put the knife away . And gave us both a sweet smile . " Honey , " he said to Cherry , " laugh ! That 's the best piece of acting I done yet . " " Oh , God , Shago , you 're evil , " she told him . But she had to shake her head . There was admiration despite herself . " I 'm just sweet and talented , honey . " He smiled sweetly at me . " Shake hands , Rojack , you 're beautiful , " he said , and took my hand . But I did not like the feel of his palm . There was something limp and leathery to the touch . " How 's that for putting you on ? " he asked of me . " First-rate , " I said . " Oh , beautiful , " he said . " Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to being ill . " That 's how Shago can sicken you , " Cherry said . " I 'm a sick devil , no doubt of that , " he said with charm . And hisp187voice was beginning to take a few turns . Accents flew in and out of his speech like flying peacocks and bats . " Haul ass , the black man is on the march , " Shago said to me suddenly , " and he wo n't stop until his elementary requirements are met . Ralph Bundle . Right ? Take your hand off my fly , ' said the Duchess to the Bishop cause she was a Duke in drag . Chuck , chuck , chuck . " He looked at me with eyes which were suddenly wild as if the absence of rest had set them racing like cockroaches under the flare of a light . " Shago , what are you on ? " Cherry asked . " Yeah . " " Oh , no . " " Well , that 's how it is , sugar . Come and cry with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be on again . " " Now , honey , could n't you tell ? When I came in the door with the street corner bit . Up in Central Park ! Sambo ! I mean I do n't go for that sauce , sugar . You know that . I 'm too pretty to rumble , and that 's a fact . Rojack , " he said in my direction , " I love you , you 're so gruesome . Put some gravy on the bread . " And he began to cackle . " Why , bless bless , my Cherry , if I got to lose , I got to lose to a square with heart , I mean he 's all that heart and no potatoes , just Ivy League ass . Harvard , I presume , Doctor Rojack . " " You 're not on horse , " Cherry said . " Stone out of my mind , baby . " " But you 're not on horse . " " About to take the needle . My steps were leading me there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So I came to see you . You can help me stop . " She shook her head . She was mute . " Honey , " he said , " you 're still creaming for me . " " I 'm not . Go away , Shago , go away . " She kept her face averted from both of us . " It 's never over , " said Shago . " I said to you once : honey , we see each other ten years from now , we still make it . You hear ? "  |p188he  said to me , " it 's never over with her and me . You got nothing but the whiskey and the embers . All those piss-wet embers . " " You wo n't know , " I said . But there could be truth in what he said , I thought suddenly . " Man , " he said , " let 's get cool and enjoy each other . I can live without my Cherry . I 've had movie stars . I put them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that way . You ask her how many times I throw away my cool . " ' What are you on ? " she repeated . " Shit and shinola . Listen , baby , take a vacation from all this . I 'm cool , now , I 'm back in my cool . " " You just waved a knife . " " No , I 'm back with the living . I swear . Here to entertain . I mean I read the scene . You and me , husband and wife except for the ring  --  but we know each other , we did n't make it . I could cry . But still I got to wish you the best . The best , Rojack , the best , Cherry . " " Make him leave , " Cherry spoke out , " please make him leave . " " No , no , no , " said Shago . The blade was out again . He held it point up , his head looking down on it like a priest with a candle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " throw them away . " She got up from the chair where she had been sitting since he entered the room and holding her wheatcoloredwrapper about herself with both arms , she walked up to him . " Put that stick away , " she said . " No . Tell him about the Freedom Rider bit . " But as if her presence close to him , her proximity to that knife , was vertigo for him , he closed the blade , put it back in his pocket and stepped away from both of us . Some spasm of language began in him . " Contemplate this , " he said to me , " I did the Freedom Rider bit . Like I was running for President of the black-ass U.S.A. That 's the Dick Gregory bit , not mine , but I did it . I did it . And I mean I got nothing but elegance to sell , plus a big beat . And that bigp189beat comes from up High , it do n't come from me , I 'm a lily-white devil in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love with myself , that 's the future . I got twenty faces , I talk the tongues , I 'm a devil , what 's the devil doing on a Freedom Ride ? Listen , " he said , building up force as he went , " I 'm cut off from my own lines , I try to speak from my heart and it gets snatched . That 's Freedom Ride . Why , " he said , with no sense of going off in another direction , " you seen my act , I remember you , you brought your wife back to me , that battleship with the pearls around her neck , you think I forget , I got elegance , man , and elegance is nothing but memory . I mean I got elegance when I do my act . " " Yes , " I said . " And I spit in your wife 's face . " " Metaphorically . " " Metaphorically . Yes , I did . And I said to myself , Man , you 're spitting in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you thought twice about it . " " Kiss me , sweets . Did n't know I thought twice about it . Why I knew your wife was society bitch . That 's a bitch ! I knew what she was promising , all that White House jazz , mow my grass , blackball , you 're so sexy  --  think I like to pass that up ? But there was your wife asking me to sing at her charity ball for no , for her smile . I said to myself , Why , lady , you would n't give half a buck to the poor nigger woman who wipes your mess in the ladies ' latrine . A quarter , that 's what she 'd leave , right ? " " I do n't know . " " Fire when ready , Gridley , we have seen the whites of their eyes . " I began to laugh . Despite myself . Finally Shago laughed . " Yeah , man , it 's so funny . But I was at the big divide . Pick it up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a society singer , I 'd had it with that Village shit , I 'd had it with that Mob shit , that big-time shit , What a nice suit you 're wearing tonight , Mr. Ganucci '  --  no , Ip190wanted the society shit cause I was right for that , but I took one look at your wife and I gave it up . I 'd played it cool all the way , passed up their parties , No , ' I 'd have my flunky say , Mr. Martin does not attend parties , ' I was a virgin , and had them eating in the crack , I was old Buddha 's ass on the stairs , but it was too much , that wife of yours  --  she cooed to me , Mr. Martin , you know I can make you change your mind , ' yeah , you bet she could , till I got a good look at her sitting with you in the front , eating me , man , I could feel the marrow oozing from my bones , a cannibal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dandruff to you , Peter the Great  --  Shago Martin ai n't adding his tit to your milk and charity . " He shook his head . " That was the end of society shit , yeah , but I was right for them , I was the cup of tea they 'd been brewing . They knew it . Cause I can do the tongues , all that cosmopolitan dreck , bit of French , bit of Texas , soupcon of Oxford jazz  --  I promise you , " he interpolated with a perfect London voice , " that we 'll have masses of fun and be happy as a clam , why , " he said , snapping his fingers , " I can pick up on the German , Chinese , Russian ( Tovarich , mother-fucker ) I can do a piece of each little bit , St. Nicholas Avenue upper nigger , Jamaican , Japanese , Javanese , high yaller sass  --  I just call on my adenoids , my fat lips and tonsils , waaaaah , I can do a grande dame , anything from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' it 's all shit , man , except for the way I use it cause I let each accent pick its note , every tongue on a private note , when I sing it 's a congregation of tongues , that 's the spook in my music , that 's why they got to buy me big or not at all , I 'm not intimate , I 'm Elizabethan , a chorus , dig ? " " You 're just an old dynamo out on the moon , " said Cherry . Tenderness for him was back in her voice . Acid entered me . " When I start talking , I hear motors . I 'm a devil , see . I used to watch your television . You 're a white ass . Her and me used to sit on that sofa and watch your television . What a sweet white ass ' I would say to her . We would laugh . "  | " Now you 're on a television show , " I said . " Yeah . Right in the hour where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so poor they do n't pay the camera . Have some hash . " He took out a cigarette rolled tight as a toothpick , lit it , offered to pass it to me . I refused . There was an unfamiliar pressure at the back of my neck , an accumulation of I did not know what , but it was from the last half hour , and it warned me to say no . I took a swallow from my whiskey glass . " " For you , girl . " He held it to her . " Uh-uh . " She shook her head . " Uh-uh . " " You pregs again ? " he asked . And at the expression on her face , he whistled , laughed , made a small demonstration . " Shee-it , " he cried out , " you ca n't tell , you ca n't tell that fast . That 's a mistake made by many . You do n't know , girl . " But the shaft was in . I saw something in his eyes as the marijuana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had the expression of a big fish just speared  --  the flank of the eyeball showed horror ; something in the past had just been maimed forever . He was suffering not from the possibility that she was pregnant but that she had had an experience with me which made her believe she was , and he knew all about that . " Listen , baby , you do n't leave me , " he said . " I 'll cut out your heart . You got nothing but spade in you , and I 'm left with that Southern shit . I 'm a captive of white shit now , " he said looking at me , his eyes blank as a prison wall . " I bathe in the flesh , you ass , " he said again , " I keep it for myself , all that white stinkeroo , all of it , but she ai n't white , no she ai n't , not my girl , she got my black in her . Yessirree , boss , thanks for that thin dime . Listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was nigger , you see , black as me , and I 'm a white man now . " " You black-ass ego , " she said , " you 're not white , you 're just losing your black . That 's why you still got your spade in you and I got my white in me . Because I do n't look back . When something'sp192done , it 's done . It 's over . " Some whiff of marijuana must have entered her nose for she talked with a strong male voice , some small-town Southern mill boss or politician  --  her brother , I realized then . " Do you think ? " she cried out , " we built white shit and progress by sayingForgive you one more time . ' Well , we did n't , you ass , we did n't . It 's done , Shago . Out of here . " " Man , " he said to her , " take your devils and banish them down to us . We 're the mirror of your ass . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't lose all your cool . " Her face flushed , her eyes bright , she looked eighteen , tough dittybop beautiful , eighteen . They stood glaring at one another . " Cool ! Baby , I got cool this professor of yours and you could n't locate in twenty years . Listen , you , " he said to me , " I should have brought my army down here . We could have put toothpicks under your nails . I 'm a prince in my territory , dig ? But I came alone . Cause I know this bitch , I know this Mafia bitch , she 's made it with hoodlums , black men , some of the class , now she picks you , Professor , looking to square out , she 's looking for something luke and tepid to keep her toes warm . You kissing them yet , you jackass ? " And with that he walked over to me , put his fingers on my chest , gave a disdainful push , " Up your ass , Mother Fuck , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes . The pressure back of my neck let go of itself and I was a brain full of blood , the light went red , it was red . I took him from behind , my arms around his waist , hefted him in the air , and slammed him to the floor so hard his legs went , and we ended with Shago in a sitting position , and me behind him on my knees , my arms choking the air from his chest as I lifted him up and smashed him down , and lifted him up and smashed him down again . " Let me go , I 'll kill you , bugger , " he cried out , and there was a moment when I could have done that , I had the choice to let him go , let him stand up , we would fight , but I had a fear of what I heard in his voice  --  it was like that wail from the end of the earth you hear in a baby 's voice.  |p193My  rage took over . I lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many times , ten times , fifteen , it could have been twenty , I was out of control , violence seemed to shake itself free from him each time I smashed him back to the floor and shake itself into me , I kept beating the base of his spine on the floor , the shock going up to his head , I had never had an idea I was this strong , exhilaration in the fact of the strength fed my strength itself , and then he went limp and I let go , stepped back , he fell back , the back of his head struck the floor with the blunt dud of an apple dropping from a tree . Shago looked at me from the ground and said , " Up your ass . " I almost kicked in his head . Close as that . Instead I picked him up , opened the door , manhandled him to the hall . There he put up resistance , and when I got a whiff of his odor which had somethingof defeat in it , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed for an hour  --  well , it was too close : I threw him down the . stairs . Some hard-lodged boulder of fear I had always felt with Negroes was in the bumping , elbow-busting and crash of sound as he went barreling down , my terror going with him in the long deliberate equivalent of the event which takes place in an automobilejust before a collision  --  and into the smash itself . The banister quivered as he hit , he looked up at me from the bottom , his face bleeding from cuts , welts springing out , his head near to misshapen like the Negro I saw in the precinct , and said , " You shit-ass , " and started trying to climb the stairs on his hands and knees which released still another core of rage in me as if it were doubly intolerablethat his will would not break  --  I knew this was how children came to kill little cats  --  and I met him on the fourth stair from the bottom and ran into one weak punch he threw which caught me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleeding later from the mark of his ring ) and then rushed him across the landing and down another flight of stairs , back another landing , down another flight of stairs , the eyes of the Puerto Ricans on us from the crack of every door , me holding him with two grips on his gray con/servative suit as if he were a bag of potatoes I could bump along , and when on the last flight of stairs he tried to bite me , I threw him down the run again , and waited while he lay still . " You had it ? " I called down , like some whiskey-flushed Episcopalianminister of doom . " Shit on your mother , " he said , getting to his hands and knees . " Shago , I 'm going to kill you , " I said . " No , man . You kill women , " he said . It was a speech , but he said it so slowly that my breath flowed back and forth five , six , eight , ten times . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed the little woman in me . " Then he made an attempt to climb the stairs , but his leg buckled , he sat down on the floor , he vomited from the pain . I stood where I was , waiting for him to finish . " All right , " he said at last , " I 'm going . " " Shago , can I get you a cab ? " He laughed like a fiend . " Well , buddy , I fear that 's your problem . " " All right , " I said . " Crazy . " " Good night , Shago . " " Say , dad , " he said , " I 'd rather they eat me outside than that you get me a cab . " " Okay " Now he smiled . " Rojack ? " " Yes . " " Tell you something , man . I do n't hate . Never . That 's it . " " That 's it . " " Tell Cherry , her and you , I wish you luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , I swear . Luck , man . " " Thank you , Shago . " " Sayonara . " He got up from the floor and put together a seriesp195of moves to get through the door to the street , progressing like a fly without wings and three legs torn off . I could hear a child crying . Through the crack of the door , her mother glared at me . But I came up the stairs to a titter of appreciationfrom the Puerto Ricans . Suddenly I realized I was wearing nothing but my bathrobe . Yes , I would have made a champion sight getting him a cab . I swayed once , feeling a bout of misery again . There was the kind of panic which comes from a dream where one is killing cockroaches . They were about me , literally ; I saw several run off in jagged directions to follow their mysterious trail  --  that line of pure anxiety  --  which one sees in the path made by a car driving over a lake of ice . But who was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaped since I returned from the police station and Cherry had been there to open the door , now flew in silent as the shadow of a bat , and my body was like a cavern where deaths are stored . Deborah 's lone green eye stared up at me . It had all gone wrong again . I could feel the break in the heavens . If I could have taken some of it back , I would have returned to that moment when I began to beat Shago to the floor and he dared me to let him go . It looked as if Cherry had not moved from the bed . She was lying on her back , and she did not stir when I came in . Her face had gone too pale , and although she had not been crying , her.lids were red , her eyes had a washed-out look . I reached to touch her hand ; a mistake  --  her skin gave back no life . I sat down to have a drink , and finished it in three nips . Perhapsninety seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This one went more slowly , but I was on whiskey again . I was on the habit when whiskey felt equal to blood . " Like a drink ? " I asked her . She did not reply . I took my next nip with the idea of leaving . It was close to midnight , I was due soon at Barney Kelly 's , and I would find no fortification for that event sitting here.  |p196But  she looked up and said , " I do n't feel right . " " You do n't look well . " ' Well , " she said , " you look about as good as you looked when I met you on the street . " " Thank you , " I said . She looked no more and no less than a tired nightclub singer . I got up from my drink , and spent the next five minutes getting dressed . " I guess you 're good at one-night stands , " Cherry said at the end of this . " Sometimes I am , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A part of me feels good . I won a fight . I ca n't help that . I alwaysfeel good when I win a fight . " Then I almost laughed at the ease with which I said it . The dread had begun to be muted in the whiskey , but it would be back , it would certainly be back . " Do n't forget , " I said , " he had a knife and I did n't . " " That 's true . " " I thought of turning him loose , but there was the knife . " I could hear something false in my voice . " In a real fight , Shago would n't have used it . " " He would n't ? " " There 's something clean about Shago , " she said . " You sure ? " She began to cry silently . I knew what it was . I had sealed the past in a vault  --  but if I ever opened the doors . . . the memory of Deborah pregnant came floating up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to mourn Deborah or my mind would ride off with me . There was nothing so delicate in all the world as one 's last touch of control . " I 'm sorry you and Shago did n't make it , " I said to Cherry . She was silent . After a long silence , I finished my second drink and started on a third . " There 's something I could tell you , " she said . But she did n't have to . I felt the thought rise in her and driftp197over to me . They had looked very good standing next to one another  --  shedid not have to explain a thing . " Yes , I know , " I said . It was rare to be in love , but to believe that you could not find a better purpose in your life  --  that was rarest of all . " Yes , 1 know , " I said , " you used to think the whole country depended on you and Shago . " " It was a crazy idea but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could make it . " She looked unhappy again . " I do n't know , Steve , it 's not good to think too much  --  at least the way I do . Cause I always end up with something like the idea that God is weaker because I did n't turn out well . " " You do n't believe everything is known before it happens ? " " Oh , no . Then there 's no decent explanation for evil . I believe God is just doing His best to learn from what happens to some of us . Sometimes I think He knows less than the Devil because we 're not good enough to reach Him . So the Devil gets most of the . best messages we think we 're sending up . " " When did you begin to have ideas like this ? " " Oh , I got them in places like Houston and Vegas , reading books and waiting for Barney Kelly to come back . Why ? " " Sometimes I think in the same way . " We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , " we ca n't leave it here . I 'm not in love with Shago any more . " " You 're not ? " " Shago killed the most beautiful idea I ever had about myself . Shago killed that idea . Sometimes I felt I was n't living with a man but with a creature . And the Devil had a pipeline into that creature and took all the hate in the country and piped it into him . Rememberwhen he was talking about the Freedom Rider bit ? " " Yes . " ' Well , he went down South for some organization . And he took his abuse with the others and had his picture in the paper ,  |p198and  spent two days in jail . The only thing  --  all that non-violence made those boys violent . When they got back to New York they had a party , and one of them flipped out , I fear , and told Shago he was a headline-hunter and had no heart in the movement cause he went around with me . Well , the fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid and his friends saw it . He started putting everything down . Everything was bad , and I was bad , and well , he lost his dignity . I had been faithful to him for two years but he was so evil that when I decided to start with Tony , I 'm afraid I offered a considerable first night . " Now I could know again why women never told the truth about sex . It was too abominable when they did . " Do you have to tell me ? " " Yes , I have to tell you . It 's either that , or go back to my shrink . " I thought of Ruta . " All right , " I said , " I 'm listening . " " Well , I thought I was in love with Tony . I had to think that . And Shago popped up as he did tonight . " " Here ? " " No . You 're the only man besides Shago I 've taken here . " She lit a cigarette . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other place . Shago had connections in Harlem and Tony was afraid of those connections because Uncle Ganucci had arrangements pendingwith them . So Tony faded : Just puke , honey . It 's a dull story . And I felt like puke . Because Shago got something back by seeing Tony was afraid of him , but it was a rotten recovery . He made me so filthy these last two months that when you were with him in the hall , I had a thought . It was : throw that nigger down the stairs . " " Yes . " " Throw that nigger down the stairs ! Shago was the only man I ever knew who could make something in me turn over when he came into a room . I do n't know if I 'll ever feel that again . I think you get that only with one man . " " Yes , " I said . Would I be good enough to take every lastp199truth she had to offer ? " Yes , " I said , " I know what you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said flatly , " we have something else . " " Yes . Yes we do . . . . Oh , honey , here we are . " " Too late to save the country . " " Stephen , I want to become a lady . " " Come on , cup-cake . " " No , a real lady . Not the kind who 's on committees or goes shopping . A real lady . " " Ladies like to be wicked and wasteful . " " No , a lady . Some day you 'll see what I mean . You bring out the lady in me . I 've never felt so nice . While you were away at the police station , I had the feeling that something would send you back to me because we could be good so many ways . Then I saw you fight Shago . You had to fight him , I know that  --  but still  --  I was sick . Oh , Lordy , ' I thought , it 's the Mafia all over again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . I was thinking of Tony . " Steve , I do n't know if we 're any good , " she said , " or just as low-down and dead as two shits . I want us dead if we turn into that . " The look of a child touched by an angel came back to her . " I want it to be all right . " But the memory of the fight lay between us . We had talked . forward , we had talked back  --  there was a hint of that time when we might be married and talk too long for too little , while beneath all surface of the marriage , like the corpse of a memory buried alive , some flaw would continue to rot at the center . " Oh , baby , the fight left a hole , " she said . Yes , love was a mountain which was climbed with a good heart and a good breath : one was brave and the other was true . The ascent was not yet begun , and I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in part already ; like all love which is spoiled we were now locked together a little more . Because she kissed me then , and the sweet which comes from a rare grape was in herp200mouth , but then something more , some hint of fever and a sly bitch , a sly wild bitch still years away from her , but coming to me from out in the future and something coming out from the years of her past : there was less of loyalty between us now , and more of the hot hair of the itch . I finished my drink . In a minute I would have to go . " Will you be all right ? " I asked . " Yes . " " Will Shago come back ? " " I do n't believe so . " " Downstairs , " I said , " Shago said to wish you good luck . ' " " Fie did ? " She seemed thoughtful . " Well , if he comes back , he comes back . " " Will you let him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let him in . I 'm not going to run from Shago . " " I 'm not so sure I 'm going to see Kelly then . " " You have to , " she said , " or we wo n't have any idea what is in his mind . I do n't want to wonder about that . " " Yes . " In fact , I had a desire to go , half a desire . It might be better to go away for a while . We were beginning to feel good again , but the mood would not last if nothing was gambled . " Sugar , " she said . " Yes . " ' Watch the booze when you 're with Kelly . " " Take your hand off my fly , ' said the Duchess to the Bishop . " We laughed . We had come a little of the way back . " Angel , " I said , " do you have any money ? " " Close to four thou . " " Let 's buy a car and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " We could go to Las Vegas , " I said . " Why ? "  | " Because if you 're going to be a lady and I 'm going to be a gentleman , then I have to win your love in every way . " She took a quick look , and saw I meant what 1 had said more than I did not ; so she smiled . " Divine , " she said . And lick ! out a finger . " We 'll make a fortune in Las Vegas . I win at the tables . " " You do ? " " Not when I roll , " she said . " You have to restrain me when I roll , cause I lose then . But when the men come up and take the dice , I come close to being a Power . Because I always know who 's going to win and who will lose . " " Well , I 'm sixteen thousand in debt , " I said , " so you better be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . And she walked me to the door , and gave a soft plump kiss for goodbye , and nipped my lip and promised me with her tongue . Then she saw me looking at Shago 's umbrella , and handed it to me . " Now , you got a stick , " she said . I descended the stairs , hearing no echo of my journey down with Shago , but in the hall at the foot of the last landing was the puddle he had left . I wanted to pass ; my preference was clearly to ignore it , but instead I laid the umbrella aside and searched in a trash can behind the stairs until I found a few pieces of sodden ill-scented cardboard with which I did my best to scrape that pottage , making several trips back and forth , the while I gagged . The odor of his stomach , certainly no better than mine , was not free of poverty  --  it had the hint of cheap Negro hash-houses with their frying fat and the gamy near-rot of chitterlings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had no desire to see Barney Oswald Kelly in less than mint condition , but it was a brutal work no matter how , for I was thinking despite myself of student sit-ins and Negroes shot in the night , and  --  any nearness to moralizing about the victim on the stairs was shut off by a whiff from the job . So I worked away , scraping slowly and carefully with my damp cardboards , expiatingp202a host of  --  I no longer knew what . Primitive feathers of thought stirred in my brain . I had some savage notion that spirits might rise from the food we threw back . There had been a time when I thought something exceptional was in my reach  --  which is to say it would have taken genius to give lucid presentation of what was sometimes near the edge of my thought ; now the farthest of my ideas depressed me , for madness was attached to mining them . A scholarly example  --  here is comedy if you wish it  --  some sense of the sinister was left as I ended the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cab , and on impulse told him to go first to Central Park and there drive about . For no demons resided in the vomit , only torture and funk , and I had an impulse to go back  --  if there were demons in Shago , they were in him still , so said my instinct  --  was it all that routine to leave Cherry alone ? But my fear of Kelly whipped up again , and spoiled the choice . I must have fallen asleep on the ride . When I looked out we were almost in Harlem and again I had a moment where I could have believed I was dead . The cab driver was silent , the streets were wet , and the vehicle was like a hearse . The handle of the umbrella seemed alive to my fingers . I had a thought . It suggested I should go into Harlem this night and drink until closing . That was right . That was the way to pay for it . There had been nights when I had done this . After very bad nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back streets and toured from bar to bar , but nothing had ever happened . The waiters had been polite , the drinkers had been polite , the streets were quiet . Even the hookers had done no more than cast an eye . I had spent some of the politest nights of my life in Harlem , and yet now  --  no , I believed in Africans and demons . If tonight I entered those bars the sound of Shago 's fall would reverberate from my mind and I would not escape some evil incident . " Do you want your love to be blessed ? " said my mind , " go to Harlem . " Something was wrong , very wrong . It had been right for ap203little while , for an hour with Cherry in that room it had been almost right , I had felt safe , and now it was bad again  --  some air of hurricane lay over my head . Once again I wished to rush back to her  --  she was my sanity , simple as that  --  and then I remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if one wished to be a lover , one could not find one 's sanity in another . That was the iron law of romance : one took the vow to be brave . Therefore , I must go to Harlem . One could see Kelly later . Or was that still another excuse ? Was it Kelly I feared the most ; would I waste the early morning hours in one uptown bar after another , my bankroll ( $75 ) safe , my person safe , neither mugged , nor accosted , nor even recognized as the latest white man to give up the guilt ; would I come to understand at four in the morning , all bars shut , that I played a trick on myself to skip an encounter with the real fear ? " Go to Kelly , " said a voice now in my mind , and it was a voice near to indistinguishable from the other voice . Which was true ? When voices came , how did you make the separation ? " That which you fear most is what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authority of your senses . " But I had taken too long to decide : I had no senses . I was now nothing but fear . " A curse on the logic of the saints , " I thought , and the taxi , making the circuit of the Park , passed the rain-washed exit to 110th Street and Seventh Avenue ; we were turning back to the center of the city . Too late for Harlem . Was it woe I knew , relief , or some nausea of the cells ? The handle of the umbrella felt sullen in my palm . I opened the window , receiving a mist of rain on my face , and breathed deeply . The air was almost clean of smog , the whiskey was burning away , guttering in my stomach like the dregs of liquid in a spirit lamp . Did it matter where I went ? If there was a dislocationto the heavens , it followed me : I would meet something tonight  --  was that not the odds ? And the voice again : " Still it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in states like this before . Possessing the salt ofp204Mohammed or Buddha I could have founded a religion . Doubtless . It is just that I would not have had too many followers . Comfortless was my religion , anxiety of the anxieties , for I believed God was not love but courage . Love came only as a reward . The metaphysics , however , was vast  --  buried in the twenty volumesI had not written . And I at this moment was buried in fear . I no longer had the confidence my thoughts were secret to myself . No , men were afraid of murder , but not from a terror of justice so much as the knowledge that a killer attracted the attention of the gods ; then your mind was not your own , your anxiety ceased to be neurotic , your dread was real . Omens were as tangible as bread . There was an architecture to eternity which housed us as we dreamed , and when there was murder , a cry went through the market places of sleep . Eternity had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fury . I shivered in the open window of the cab . What was it Shago had said ? " Man , I was spitting in the face of the Devil . " He was wrong . It was the Devil 's daughter . And the memory of Barney Oswald Kelly came back . For we were approaching the Waldorf and I could feel his presence in a room near the top of the Towers.  |p205THE  TAXI turned around on Park Avenue , came up to the canopy , the doorman said good evening and gave a smile . I had passed him five dollars one blizzard of a night long ago when he managed to produce a cab for Deborah and me ; the gift was old , but he remembered , and I , remembering that evening , had a sudden unaccountableurge not to enter by the main lobby , not at this late and empty hour . It was raining harder now , a cold rain which gave a hint of ice underfoot ; I opened Shago 's umbrella . The spars slid up the mast with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cloth filled out . A voice came through the handle and into my palm  --  so it seemed . " Go to Harlem , " said the voice . But I was on my way to the Towers . There was a private entrance on Fiftieth Street not a hundred feet from the corner , and I would take an elevator there , and avoid the lobby.  |p206The  street outside the side entrance was decked , however , with three limousines double-parked and a squad of motorcycle policemen stood at the door . I had a moment of panic  --  they were there for me , they must certainly be there for me  --  it took the time to light a cigarette before I recovered sufficiently to walk through the file and through the door ; then up in the foyer against still another eight , each man more than six feet two , handsome as a prize herd of test-tube bulls . Their herder ( I almost bumped into him ) was a small plump detective from the Commissioner 's office , welldressed , with a round petulant face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevator and as I approached he did two things at once : he managed to avoid looking at me , yet succeeded in studyingmy clothes . There was something wrong with me , he knew that  --  some remnant in his memory of my picture in the paper . But he gave it up , and turned to the elevator girl . " She 'll be coming down in three minutes . In about one minute I 'll be going to the floor with you . " Then I knew the police were there to escort the First Lady to her limousine or there to take a visiting princess out to a nightclub  --  some woman of huge institutional importance was about to descend  --  and I had no desire to wait . The air had the virile blank intensity of a teller 's cage . So I went out again , opened my umbrella , took the short trip back to the main entrance , smiled at the doorman , and climbed the marble steps into the lobby of the Waldorf , a mountaineer'sfatigue coming into me with this ascent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder and my chest , a pain so bright it gave promise of severing the nerve  --  there was nothing to save me but the pain itself  --  it reached to climax , opened an iron glove , ebbed , went away , and left me staring at the lobby of the Waldorf . But for a moment I had died and was in the antechamber of Hell . I had long had a vision of Hell : not of its details ; of its first moment . A giant chandelier of crystal above one 's head , red flock on the walls , red carpet , granite pillars ( as I proceeded ) now a highp207ceiling , was it gold foil ? a floor of white and black , and then a room of blue and green in whose center stood a nineteenth-century clock , eight feet high with a has relief of faces : Franklin , Jackson , Lincoln , Cleveland , Washington , Grant , Harrison , and Victoria ; 1888 the year : in a ring around the clock was a bed of tulips which looked so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real . I needed a drink but the Peacock Lounge was closed . One old woman in ermine came trailing by , and left a perfume behind , faint as the ghost of a jewel box . I had to quit the clock . But back in the lobby , the Waldorf looked like one of those silent rooms in the Casino at Monte Carlo , one of the dead and empty spaces which collect about the exit of a man who has lost a million in an hour . I had thought to mount the stairs to Kelly 's apartment , all thirty-plus flights , a passing thought , but it would not quit me . I had some sense this was what I must do , it might be the equal of going to Harlem . Yet I could not begin . It seemed too heroic to mount those fire stairs , go through locks and ambushes , up through vales of anathema exuding from the sleep of the wealthy ; and night detectives to be encountered . . I could see my picture in the paper , **30;5759;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to walk those stairs , ascend through fear and fever , even fail in some exhausted spasm of the heart , than be whipped along by elevator through the belts of psychic magnetism which guarded the tower . In an alcove of the main floor , one flight above the entrance from the street , was a continuation of the private cars . While I waited , I went into a study of the doors , a frieze of nymphs and willowy dryads with stainless-steel hair and slim steel breasts . The elevator stopped with a strain of annoyance , as if , at this hour , visitorswould not be walking through the lobby . I gave the operator  --  a sturdy turnip of a woman  --  the name of Barney Kelly , and she studied me like a police matron . " Mr. Kelly expecting you ? " " Indeed he is. "  |p208While  we ascended , I felt the air burning from the shaft and some rich exhaust went out of my lungs as if I had fallen asleep in a room with a fire and awakened from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxygen and my satyr 's heaven was compounded of suffocation . Up we went , rocketing the stories of the Waldorf , while the umbrella in my hand quivered like a rod , a dowsing rod , as if here , here , we had just passed some absoluteof evil to the left , and there to the right an unknown concentrate , crypts of claustrophobia , abysses of open space , now through a distillate of gloom  --  what depression surrounded the rich  --  and some compass of direction went awry in my mind ; I had the physical impression we were moving through a tunnel rather than rising in a shaft ; once again I felt something begin to go out of the very light of my mind , as if the colors which lit the stage of my dreams would be more modest now , something vital was ready to go away forever even as once , not thirty hours ago , I had lost some other part of myself , it had streamed away on a voyage to the moon , launched out on that instant when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit me forever , that ability of my soul to die in its place , take failure , go down honorably . Now something else was preparing to leave , some certainty of love was passing away , some knowledge it was the reward for which to live  --  that voice which I could no longer deny spoke again through the medium of the umbrella . " Go to Harlem , " said the voice , " if you love Cherry , go to Harlem  --  there is time . " Then I knew how afraid I was of Harlem , and argued with that voice , saying , " Let me love her some way not altogether deranged and doomed . It makes no sense to go to Harlem . Let me love her and be sensible as well . " " The sensible are never free , " said the voice . " Let me be free of you . " " Free as you wish , " said the voice , and something departed from me , some etched image of Cherry 's face turned to mist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost tottered . For the elevator decelerated with a plunge of sinkers at my chest ; we were there . I went down the hall , a long hall with a carpet of civilized brown , much milk in it , and pale green walls , light as a new leaf . Kelly 's door was familiar , it had a medallion beneath the knocker , a miniature of the coat of arms of the Mangaravidis and the Caughlins , quarterly , 1 and 4 , gules , a lion rampant ; 2 , 3 , sable , serpent argent , crowned azure , vorant a child proper  --  so Deborah had delineatedthe blazons . And the motto : Victoria in Caelo Terraque . For a moment I began to shake , as from a chill . Not from the motto ( yes , from the motto , too ) but from the memory of the half-dozen times I had come to this door . Then I lifted the knocker . Ruta answered . She was wearing an expensive black silk with a string of pearls , and her face stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapacious  --  some energy returned to my blood  --  the blood no longer felt as if it would flow away to the moon , no , some pig 's riot gave promise of existing still , and I stood at the door , giving a full stare at her , while a provisional sanity began to form . " You look well , " I said . She smiled . Two or three hours plus a full twenty-four must have gone by since she quit the precinct , but she had found the time to go to a beauty parlor , the best beauty parlor in New York no doubt . Now the red in her hair was perfect as the red and brown of a fine wood with a lick of flame , the soft lick of a flame , and the red of a rich clay to support the fire and the wood . " Good evening , Mr. Rojack , " she said . The last time I had been this close , Ruta 's hair was half down her neck , the roots had shown , lipstick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to every side , her clump in my fingers and both of us dripping ozone in the haste of making love while standing up . A host of the heats came to me on a whiff of my own odor nowp210and the hint was there again between us . Her pointed nose , sensitive to mood as the antennae of a cat , tilted to the side and looked at the unprotected space between my cheek and my ear . " Well , bless you for being so good with the cops , " I said . " Oh , " she said , " you are much too kind . " We were thinking that she had been not so very good after all , not with the cops . " But , in fact , I tried to do you no harm . After all , I do not dislike you . " " I would count on it that you did n't . " She stirred in the attention between us . " Of course not , " she said , " of course . But what woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crap . " Then she smiled sweetly as if to think of secrets . " Betweenus , " Ruta said , " your father-in-law had something to do with getting you off . " " I wonder why ? " " You must ask him yourself . " She looked , for an instant , about to offer me more , but her expression moved on . " Look , " she said , " it is disturbed here tonight . There have been people all evening . Now two are left . I tell you in secret they are horrible . " " Let 's go in nonetheless . " " You would not like to see Deirdre first ? " " She 's back from school ? " " Of course she is back . She waited until midnight for you toappear . Then her grandfather sent her to bed . She is up , however . " I had a pure woe , as if an airplane dropped suddenly . The routewas too round about . I had forced my nerve to be ready for Kelly ; now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I didnot want them . Indeed I had met Deirdre on the day I met Kelly , here in this suite nine years ago , and the recollection was notpleasant . Deborah had too been terrified of her father . Her lipsquivered when Kelly spoke to her . I was never to see her so uselessagain , and thus had a hint of the shame she felt in marrying me . Only Deirdre had been able to save a part of the meeting . Shep211had not seen her mother in more than a month , she had been sent from Paris to visit Kelly six weeks ago , but it was my face she ran to across the room , there in front of her mother and grandfather . " Moi , je suis gros garcon , " she said to me . For a three-year-old , she was very small . " Tu as tres chic , mais tu n'as pas Bien l'air d'un garcon . " " Alors , c'est grand papa qui est gros garcon ? " We laughed . It was the only laughter of the visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting her hand on my arm . " I do n't know , " I said to her , " if I can bear to see Deirdre . " " Pay cash , " said Ruta . She drew me to a bedroom . " Look , " she said , " I will try to wait for you . There 's something I want to talk about . " She gave another smile , reached across to open the door and said , " Deirdre , your stepfather is here . " There was a flight from the bed . A thin figure , a wraith with arms , hugged me hard . " Turn on the lamp , " I said . " I want to see what you look like . " Actually I had a fear of being in the dark with Deirdre , as if my brain would be too vivid . But with the lights on , there were no pictures of the night before . I was suddenly happy to see Deirdre . For the first time since entering the hotel 1 felt back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . She had grown since I had seen her last at Christmas , she was going to be tall and very slim . Already I could no longer kiss the top of her hair . Soft as a bird 's feather , Deirdre 's hair offered the suggestion of a wood where birds were nesting . She was not a pretty child , she was nothing but eyes  --  she had a thin triangular face with a chin much too pointed , a mouth as wide as Deborah 's and a nose whose nostrils were too chiseled for a child  --  but eyes she had ! Enormous , and stared at one with a clear luminous look , an animal 's fright , some creature with huge eyes.  | " I was afraid I would n't see you , " she said . " Of course you would . I was n't going to disappear . " " I ca n't believe any of it . " She always spoke like an adult . She had one of those charming accents which belong to children who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice invoked the precise breathless tone of her nuns . " Mummy does n't feel dead . " " She does n't . " Tears came to Deirdre 's eyes like a tide welling into two hollows of sand . " Nobody mourns her . It 's awful . Even Grandfather is in a state . " " He is ? " " Cheerful . " She began to cry . " Oh , Steve , I 'm lonely . " She said this in the voice of a full widow , then kissed me with a pure flesh of grief . " The shock must be worse for your grandfather than anyone else . " " It 's not shock . I do n't know what it is . " " Is he numb ? " " No . " Grief passed her by like a wind . She was thoughtful again . Suddenly I knew that the nerves were shattered : her skin kept her intact , but the nerves spoke in separate broken bits . One bit wept , another had a thought ; a third was dumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Mummy , Grandfather was in a very good mood . He said , You know , children , a celebration is in order . I made twenty million today . ' ' That must have been a bore , ' Mummy said . No , ' he said , this time it was n't because I had to take a big chance . ' Well , that 's how he is now . " She shivered again . " I hate being here . I was writing a poem when they told me this morning . Then there was nothing but Grandfather 's limousine to take me back . " She was an exquisite poet . " Do you remember anything from the poem ? " " Just the last line now . And share my fools for bread . ' That'sp213the last line . " A small look opened its arms to me . " Mummy does n't feel dead yet , " she said . " We 've talked about that , have n't we ? " " Steve , I used to ' hate Mummy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certainly not ! " She was directly offended by my remark . " I came to hate her because she was awful to you . " " We were awful each to the other . " " Mummy told me once that you were a young soul and she was an old one . There was the trouble . " " Do you know what she meant ? " " I think she meant she had had other lives . Maybe she was there during the French Revolution and the Renaissance , or was even a Roman matron watching Christians be tortured . But you were a new soul , she said , and had n't had a life before this one . It was all-absorbing , but she had to go on to say you were a coward . " " I think I am . " " No . People with new souls have terror cause they ca n't know if they 'll be born again . " She shivered . " I 'm afraid of Mummy now . " she said . " When she was alive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while when she chose to be nice , so nice . Still I was really terrified of her . When she separated from you , I told Mummy what I thought  --  we had a scene . She pulled open her negligee and showed me the place on her stomach where she had a scar . " " Yes , I know the scar . " " It was awful . " " Yes , it was very much there . " " She said , I got this nifty little Caesar giving birth to you , pet , so do n't complain . Caesars always turn out to be more trouble than anybody . In your case , Deirdre , you have turned out a bat . ' And I said , You have a cross on your belly . ' Which is true , Steve . She had a horizontal wrinkle in the middle of her belly , and the scar from the Caesar ran right across it . " Something strangled in her ,  |p214some  wistful desire to be less extraordinary . " Steve , those few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She repeated , I 'm sorry , Deirdre , but you have turned out a bat . ' And I was very hurt  --  because it 's true , that 's what I look like . You know Mummy . Once she says something to people , you 're put away like an insect on a pin . You never escape . I knew for the rest of my life I would alwayssee myself that way . Oh , Steve . I said to her , If I 'm a bat , you 're Dracula 's wife , ' which was fantastic to say because I was n't talking about you at all , it was Grandfather , and Mummy knew I meant him . Well , then she became very silent , and began to cry . I 'd never seen her cry . She said our blood was all filled with vampires and saints . Then she said she had only a little while to live . She was sure of that . She said she really did love you . You were the love in her life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were closer than we 'd ever been . But of course she spoiled it . She said , Well , after all , he 's virtually the real love in my life . " " She said that ? " " I told her she was a beast . She said , Beware of beasts . There 's a species which stays alive three days after they die . " " What ? " " She said that , Steve . " " Oh , no . " " I do n't feel as if she 's dead yet . " It was as if a door high above us had closed . I looked around the room . " I 'm going to end as a lush , I swear , dear child . " " You ca n't . Promise you wo n't take a drink tonight . " It was an impossible request  --  I could not sit in wake on the liquor I had drunk already ; yet I nodded . " It 's awful to break a vow , " she said seriously . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . " She got into bed like a child . She was a child again . " Steve , " she asked , " can I come live with you ? " " You mean , at once ? "  | " Yes . " I was silent for a moment . " Do you know , Deirdre , it may take a while . " " Are you in love with a woman ? " I hesitated . But one could tell Deirdre anything . " Yes , " I said . " What is she like ? " " She 's kind of blonde and sort of beautiful . She has a funny sense of humor and she sings in nightclubs . " " She does ? " Deirdre was enthralled . " Oh , Steve , a nightclub singer . It 's stellar to find a girl like that . " She was profoundly impressed . " I want to meet her . Can I ? " " Maybe in a few months . You see , we just began last night . " She nodded her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a death . " " Hush , gros garcon . " " I 'll never be able to live with you , Steve . I know that now . " A cloud of sorrow concentrated itself into a tear , one pure tear which passed on the mood from her narrow chest into mine . I was in love with Cherry again . " Bless you , pet , " I said , and then to my surprise I began to cry . I cried for Deborah for a little while , and Deirdre cried with me . " It 's going to take years before it feels the least bit real , " said Deirdre . She gave a wet adolescent kiss to my car . " ' Forests are conceived in sorrow , ' " she said . ' fiat 's the first line of my poem about fools and bread . " " Good night , Deirdre baby . " " Call me tomorrow . " She sat up in sudden agony . " No , tomorrow'sthe funeral . Will you be there ? " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fury . " " Angel , trust me on this . I do n't think I can go to that funeral . I wo n't drink tonight , but do n't expect me at the funeral . " She lay back and closed her eyes with a tense flutter of her lids.  | " I do n't think your mother would want me there . I think she would rather I thought about her in my head . That 's better , I think . " " All right , Steve . " It was the way I left her . Ruta was waiting . " Well , " she said , " was it very bad ? " I nodded . " You should not go around killing mothers , " said Ruta . I made no answer . I was a fighter who had taken too many . The smile was on my face but the end of the round would be welcome , and a drink for the next round . " Listen , " Ruta murmured , " you and me , we will talk later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall of the suite to a sitting room . Kelly was there and an old woman I recognized . She had the reputation of being the most evil woman ever to live on the Riviera , no small reputation . And Eddie Ganucci was there . But I had no more than taken them in when Kelly was on me . He put out his arms and gave an embrace , a powerful bewildering embrace , for he had never done more than shake my hand all the years I had been married , but now he held me with some deep authority of feeling . There had been times when Deborah greeted me this way , invariably when I arrived alone and late at a cocktail party and she was drunk . She would hug me then with gravity , her body immobile for many long seconds as if she had been guilty that afternoon of filthy infidelities and was expiating them now by a show of devotion . But there had always been a hint of mockery in the depth of the gravity she assumed , as if standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegiance I would never find at other times . On rare moments when the icy treacherous tone I heard in so many of our fornications had worn to the distaste of final exhaustionthere would come again a moment when to make love to Deborah was like a procession through a palace , each stroke a step upon a purple walk . I was trapped in such an embrace now , Ip217could feel the beating of Kelly 's heart , some mighty sense of the powers in a cavern , and then  --  precisely as I used to feel with Deborah  --  there was an intimation of treachery one could recover only in a dream as if alone in a room , windows shut , a paper had blown from the table . Beneath a toilet water of punctilio and restraint ( a mixture of cologne and limewater which Deborah liked to borrow ) a deep smell came off Kelly , a hint of a big foul cat , carnal as the meat on a butcher 's block , and something else , some whiff of the icy rot and iodine in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand . With it all was that congregated odor of the wealthy , a mood within the nose of face powder , of perfumes which leave the turpentine of a witch 's curse , the taste of pennies in the mouth , a whiff of the tomb . It was all of Deborah for me . " Bless , bless , " said Kelly in a muffled voice . And released me with the deft little push of a banker sending you ahead of him through a door . There were tears in his eyes , and looking at him , there were tears in mine , for he had some of Deborah 's face , the wide curved mouth , the green eyes with a needle 's point of light  --  some of the love I had never been able to give to her came rising up in me now , so that our embrace done , I had a desire to hug him again and truly , as if there were a comfort to be found in his flesh , as if indeed it was Deborah and me on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bruised exhaustion we would grasp each other in a kind of sorrow , my sense of myself as a man all gone , her sense of herself as a woman equally gone , both of us reduced to the state of children in a tearful misery , in that soreness of the heart which looks for balm and makes the flesh of man and woman - equal for a moment . And in that way , the embrace finished , I could have hugged him for a moment , his presence more real to me as an embodiment of Deborah than of himself . But my emotions were like Deirdre 's I realized suddenly  --  their continuation was shattered  --  if it was grief I felt , it had gone off like a small bomb . I was stiff and cold in the next moment , and wary of him , for thep218tears wiped from his face with one elegant pass of his handkerchief , he put one look into my eyes , like a tracer of light it leaped into me , and he had the secret  --  if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none now : he knew what I had done to Deborah . " Well , " he said , " oh good God , well , what a ghastly hour this is for all of us . " And I could feel his emotion retreat . Like a bull I had charged into the warm billow of a cape , and now was wrenched about to find nothing but the air . " Forgive me , " he said to the guests . " Oswald , of course not , " said the lady . " I know I 'm about to leave . You want to talk to your son-in-law . Naturally . " " No , I wo n't hear of leaving , " said Kelly . " Not for a little while . Let 's have one drink . " And he made the introductions . " You met Mr. Ganucci  --  he was telling me how the two of you were thrown together . That must have been fun . And Bessie  --  you know Bess ? " I bowed my head . Her name was Consuelo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Deborah 's mother . She had been a great beauty once  --  she was still a great beauty . There was a grand profile , and violet-blue eyes , a hair tinted in balance between mercury and bronze . Her skin was the color of cream and there was a flush of strawberry make-up on her cheek . But her voice cracked . " Deborah and I visited you once , " I said . " Of course , I was telling Oswald about it tonight . Oswald , if I 'm going to drink , give me more of the Louis Treize . " Ruta got up immediately and went to the table to make her a drink . Bess turned to me . " You 've improved since I saw you . " " Better a little , worse a little , " I said . I was trying to remember what Bess had done : there was an episode in her legend which was notorious  --  it was one of the worst stories I had ever heard  --  but my memory would not produce it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " Watch the brandy on your heart , " Kelly murmured.  | " I do n't want to hear about brandy , " Bess said . " I drink Scotch with bores , coke with great-grandchildren , and save brandy for ghastly hours . " " Please stop it , Bess , " said Kelly . " No . Weep , both of you . Scream your heads off . The most heavenly girl in the whole glorious world has been plucked from us . I ca n't keep it in . " " She was a peach , " Ganucci said in his hoarse voice . " You hear , " said Bess , " even this old wop can tell you . " Kelly put his head in his hands for a moment , and then raised his face . He was a big man with a smooth body and very white skin , not pale but white , a full buttermilk white with shadings of pink , all flesh . One had the impression he was a bit wide in the middle , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfect shape for his head . He had a large head which began with a small pointed chin , went up to an urbane button of a nose , and on to a broad forehead . Since he was half bald , the length of his forehead seemed equal to the distance from his eyes to his chin . He looked at times like one of those very handsome babies who at the age of three months come out a stout hearty fifty-five years old . Actually he was sixty-five , and physically impressive , for he gave off the fortified good humor which is to be found in the company of generals , tycoons , politicians , admirals , newspaper publishers , presidents , and prime ministers . He had in fact a pronounced resemblance to a particular president and particular prink minister , but then for fact Kelly had two separate manners , one , British ; the other , American ; you had to learn to distinguish . The British was clipped , jolly , full of tycoon ; he might have you knifed but dependablyyou would receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American was hard in the eyes  --  they turned from green to gray , and his face went cold  --  those eyes would buy you , sell you , close you out , walk past your widow ; they measured you face to face , they were dirty Irish  --  they would put dirty sand in your concrete.  |p220His  voice , however , was rich , an instrument ; it purred with good fun . Only at the end of a sentence would he give a turn to the meaning and put you away . I had heard people say he had the charm to capture anything alive if he liked it  --  he had never liked me . " Have some brandy , Stephen , " he said now . " I 've been doing little but drink . " " Should n't wonder . I 've had a quantity myself . " In the silence which followed he waved Ruta aside , went to the bar , put a little Remy Martin into a large snifter and passed it to me . As he did , his nail gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of loss much as if a beauty had brushed my hand and delivered a message to my back of fine mysteries yet to discover . I held the glass , but the promise to Deirdre was on me ; I took no sip . Now , another small silence developed . So I sat there holding my glass , living in the pall which comes the moment there is silence at a wake ; that happiness which arrived for a while talking to Deirdre now disappeared . " You know , Mr. Kelly , " said Ganucci , his voice whispering over its way like a fist rubbed down the bark of a tree , " I started as a poor man . " By God , so did I , " said Kelly out of a reverie . " And I 've always felt like a poor man , " said Ganucci . " Do n't know that I have , " said Kelly . " I still feel like a poor man in this regard  --  I love class . Your daughter had the class of the angels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that . That 's why I came to pay my respects tonight . " " I 'm honored that you 're here , Mr. Ganucci , " said Kelly . " That 's nice of you to say . I know there 've been all kinds of people here this afternoon and this evening , and you must be tired , but I came here to tell you this : I 'm a big man in certain people 's eyes , only I do n't kid myself , you 're a bigger man , you 're a very big man . I came to pay my respects . I 'm your friend . I would do anything for you . "  | " Darling , " said Bess to Ganucci , " you 've written your letter . Now mail it . " " Darling , " said Kelly , " is this the night to he rude to Mr. Ganucci ? " " I 'm ready to explode , " said Bess . The telephone rang . Ruta got up again to answer . " It 's Washington , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other room . " The moment Kelly was gone , Ganucci said , " I 'm not even rude to the little colored fellow who shines my shoes . " " Well , he 's the future , darling , " said Bess . " That 's right , " said Ganucci , " and you and me are dead . " " Some of us are more dead than others , pet . There are weeds and roses through all the world . " " No , " said Ganucci again to Bess , " you and me are dead . " " Weeds and roses , " Bess replied . " You know what the dead are , " said Ganucci . " They 're concrete . You 'll make a good bump on Route 4 in New Jersey . " " Is that the one which starts to go to Tuxedo Park ? " asked Bess . " Yeah , that 's the one . " " Dreadful road , " said Bess . Ganucci started coughing again . " Listen , please do n't call me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was Jack , " he said to me . " I le said to send you his regards and commiserations . I lc also said it was an awful shock to him , and he knows you must be feeling awful . 1 did n't know you knew him . " " We met in Congress , " I said . " Of course , " said Kelly . " As a matter of fact , I met Deborah because of him . " " Yes , yes , now it 's back to me . I remember she even said something to me about you then . She said , You better watch out  --   |p222there  's a half-Jewish fellow I 'm crazy about . ' More power to you , ' I said . Would you believe it  --  I was opposed to Jack at the time . I was wrong . I was so damn wrong . And wrong about Deborah . Oh , Christ , " he bellowed suddenly , in a shock of sound , like an animal receiving the blow of a bullet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the room once more . " Well , now we 'd better be going , " said Bess . " No , " said Ruta , " he 'll be very upset if you 're not here when he comes back . " " You know him well , do you , dear ? " Ruta smiled . " Nobody knows Mr. Kelly well , " she said . " Nonsense , " said Bess . " I know him inside out . " " Is that so , Mrs. Trelawne ? " Ruta asked . " Darling , I was his first big fling . He was only twenty-four , but a treasure chest . I got to know him . How I got to know him . Inside out . I 'll tell you , my dear , " she said to Ruta , " he wo n't marry you . " " Oo la la , Mrs. Trelawne , " said Ruta . " Be a honey , and put a cold compress on his neck . Tell him I have to go . " The moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Watch out , baby boy , Barney 's up to mangling you tonight . " " Barney Kelly do n't go in for blitzes , " said Ganucci . " No , Mr. Ganucci . You do n't either , I 'm sure . You just make a little money on dope and prostitutes and dropping wops into boiling asphalt , " said Bess . " Passe , " said Ganucci , and coughed . " Very afraid of popping off , are n't you ? " Bess said next . " The dead , " said Ganucci , " are concrete . They 're part of the sidewalk . That 's the way it goes . " " No , tesoro , you 'll go through an accounting . They 'll bring you to your patron saint , and your saint will say , Eddie Ganucci is unspeakable . Hang him on a hook . ' " Ganucci sighed . His stomach made an unhappy sound , some/thing kin to the leak and gurgle in an old washing machine when the water is being changed . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was all too unhappily true . He sat there in a funk of gloom , we sat in silence , and a pestilence came up from Ganucci , a ripple of the worm of life trapped in a cement given off by itself . Death had already invaded him . Just as one hears in the yawp of a bird seized by a larger bird one squawk of agony sucked in from the nerve of nature itself , so now Ganucci gave off an essence of disease , some moldering from the tree of death . I knew his smell up close would be an event , one of those odors to which there is no end , a gangrene in the firmament . I wanted a drink , wanted it with my tongue against my teeth ; as if alcohol , and alcohol alone , could clean the particles which traveled from Ganucci 's breath to mine . " Let me tell a story , " said Ganucci . " I had a parrot once friends gave me . They taught the parrot how to talk . Eddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of it , you 're full of it , ' and I 'd say , Polly , that kind of talk is going to get you the oven some day . ' And the parrot would say , Ganooch , you 're full of it . You 're full of it . ' And I 'd say , Polly , keep talking and you 'll find the way , ' and the parrot said , you 're full of it , ' and got sick and died . That 's a sad story . " Bess had her handkerchief out . " The room is absolutely foul , " she said . I went to the French windows , opened them , and stepped out on the terrace . It was a good respectable terrace , perhaps thirty feet long and twenty feet deep , and I walked out to the end of it and looked over the parapet , a stone railing about forty inches high , taking the gift of looking down to the street , all thirty and more stories of vertical fall , a swoop and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some eternity of measurement to the wet pavement below , and a desire started up in me again , faint as the first tuning of a bow in an empty hall . The moon was pushing through scud , and drifts passed over its face . I knew the longer I stayed at this parapetp224the more I would be tempted  --  fresh air lifted to my head like a lyric , I could not have enough of it . And I had a sudden thought , " If you loved Cherry , you would jump , " which was an abbreviation for the longer thought that there was a child in her , and death , my death , my violent death , would give some better heart to that embryojust created , that indeed I might even be created again , free of my past . The wish to jump was clean , keen and agreeable , nice as the nicest things I had done , and I could not quit yet  --  I had the feeling that to go back in the room would be equal to deserting what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get up and stand on the parapet , as if to dare the desire by coming closer to it would be logical , and the dread which followed this thought had a pure thrill like the moment in adolescence when one realizes one is finally going to get it , get sex  --  but what a fear ! I was trembling . And then as if I were entering a great calm , like that calm I found the moment I began to run up the slope of the hill in Italy , I stood on a deck chair , and took the half-step up to the parapet . It was a foot wide , room enough to stand , and I stood on it , my legs a jelly , and felt some part of the heavens , some long cool vault at the entrance , a sense of a vast calm altogether aware of me . " God exists , " I thought , and tried to steal a look down the fall , but was not ready , not so much of a saint was I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked away , looked back at the terrace just a step down on the other side , was about to get off , and had a knowledge that to quit the parapet now was too soon  --  the desire to jump would be only more powerful . " But you do not have to jump , " said the voice in my mind , " just take a walk around the parapet . " " I can not take even one step , " I answered . " Take one step . " I pushed my foot forward , scraping it forward inch by inch ; my will , divided against itself , was quivering from the effort : I looked ahead and was frozen . For I was in the middle , fifteen feet from the corner of the terrace , fifteen feet of walk on a parapet onep225foot wide , and a fall of thirty stories on my right ; then I would have to turn the corner , and walk another twenty feet hack to where the terrace ended at the wall of the suite . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still another . I could do it perhaps . And then the wind came up with a sudden blast  --  like the impact of a trailer truck as it goes by  --  and I almost lost my balance : the fall to the street was sharp as a blade , Shago 's blade , and I jumped off , back to the terrace , and looked at the French windows to see Kelly standing in them . " Here , " he said , " come on in . " His face made visible by the light of the room , there was nothing in his expression to indicate he had seen me on the parapet , and perhaps he had n't , perhaps he had come out an instant after I dropped back , or had been unable to see for the first moment in the dark , but there was a grin on his face , one hard hearty grin like the look of a man who has penetrated a riddle . And as we went inside , a force came off him , clear as a command . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a free flight of paranoia through the storm , the lights in the room dimmed on this thought , then came up again . " Yeah , " said Ganucci , " it 's late . Want a ride in the elevator ? " he asked of Bess . Her face was a staging of masks , a collapsing of cakes and powders until the bone stood out . It was just a glimpse , some vision perhaps of how she saw herself , but the war looked to have been fatal . " Yes , I 'll go , " she said to Ganucci . Kelly stood at the door . He would walk them to the elevator . Ruta was nervous when we were alone . She had obviously a great deal to say and very little time to say it in . But 1 was breathing relief . The three steps on the parapet had left me weak , yet the weakness was agreeable , I felt as if 1 had come up out of a deep sleep . Of course whatever I had accomplished on the parapet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been finished . But I was back at least in the room , Kelly was gone for a minute or two , there was respite : on this hearth , at this moment , Ruta was nearlyp226equal to an old friend . But then a look from her sharp as a whiff of ammonia awakened me completely . " Ruta , your double life seems to be over . " " That is too bad , " she said . " I like a double life . " " You did n't mind picking up after Deborah ? " " Oh , your wife was not neat . Rich girls are pigs . But I am not just a maid , you know . " " No , I should be aware of that . " " Of course , I am nothing official . I just have concentration to do a job . Barney wanted me to do it , so I did it . I kept an eye on things . " " Just what ? " " Oh , some of your wife 's activities . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Some years . I met him in West Berlin at a nice party . Never mind . " " And now you are . . . " I was about to say , " a most extraordinary little spy . " " Nothing at all . I help Mr. Kelly . " " But Deborah was dabbling with spies  --  was she really ? " " An absolute amateur . " " You do n't expect me to believe you ? " " She had no real standing , " Ruta repeated with pride . " Nonetheless , " I said , " Deborah must have caused some worry . " " Oodles of worry , " Ruta said . " Last night there must have been electricity burning in government offices all over the world . " She was talking of a fine meal  --  gluttony in her voice at all that electricity . " Yes , they had to let you go . Since nobody can know if you know a little or a lot , a real investigation would be ending der Teufel knows where . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are the Tex f el , " she went on , " you take what you want . " " Ruta , you have n't told me a thing . " " And if I told you , then would you help me on something ? "  | " I would try to answer your questions as well as you answer mine . " " Yes , that may be good . " " What was Deborah up to ? " " Nobody knows . " " Now , what do you mean ? " " Nobody knows for certain . It 's always like that . Believe me , Mr. Rojack , the more you learn the more you know there are never any answers , just more questions . " " I 'm curious to hear a fact or two . " " Facts . " She shrugged . " You may know them already . " " She had three lovers  --  that I know . " " You do n't know who they were ? " No . " " Well , good . Let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's more or less special . " " In the government ? " " Pretend I did n't hear the question , Mr. Rojack . " " And another ? " " Another is a Russian who 's attached to the embassy at Park Avenue . The third is an Englishman who is a liquor representative for some Scotch firm and used to be in British intelligence during the war . " " Still is , you may be certain , " I said . " Of course , " said Ruta . " That 's the lot ? " " She may have had something to do with a fellow named Tony who was up to see her once or twice . " " Did she like Tony ? " " Not too much , I would say . " " What was Deborah actually up to ? " I asked . " If you want my real opinion , " said Ruta . " I do . "  | " She was out to embarrass her father profoundly . She wanted him to come to her , to beg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important people in the world decided Barney Kelly was up to something bad , or could not control his daughter . " " But what was Deborah interested in ? " " Lots . Too much . Believe me , everything and nothing . She was a gossip center and she pretended to be important . If you really desire my personal opinion , I think it gave her tremendous sexual excitement . Some women like horseback riders , some go for ski jumpers , there are women who are interested in nothing but Polish brutes , and Deborah had a petite faiblesse for the best agents . Whateverit was , it was very bad for her father . He suffered very much over this . " " All right , Ruta , thank you , " I said . Despite three separate spasms of jealousy for three lovers , there had been a small intoxicationin the center of the pain to be learning something at last . " Still , " said Ruta , " I have not asked you what I wanted to ask . " " Please do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I work for Mr. Kelly ? What do you think I look for ? " " Marrying him . " " Is it so obvious ? " " No . But I trust Mrs. Trelawne . " " It stands out then  --  my ambition ? " " A little , perhaps . Of course you 're very smart . " " I am obviously not smart enough to hide it . That is , I am smart enough , but I have not had sufficient advantages . So I would like assistance . " " An assistant ? " " A partner . To advise me . " " Bess is right , my dear . He 's not going to marry you . " " You 're talking like a fool , Mr. Rojack , and you are not a fool . I 'm not such an egomaniac that I do n't think Mr. Kelly ca n't buyp229and sell a girl like me ten thousand times . But I know something . " Her eyes now protruded slightly Germanically as if the pressure of her idea was back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked . " A great deal . I have a chance he will marry me . If I can play the cards . " " What do you propose to pay your consultant ? " " You told me you were hard as nails . I believe you . I would not try to trick a man like you . Besides , " she said , " you can trust me . " I was enjoying this . " The trick , " I said , " is to keep a sense of proportion . Why should I ever trust you ? I certainly could n't trust you with the bulls . " Bulls ? Bulls ? Her lack of this word irritated her like the search for a missing tool . " The police . " " Oh , " she said , " last night ! You half-promised to make me a baby . I did n't necessarily want a baby , but you promised , and then you did n't . That is a very little thing , but it does not create undying loyalty in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recollection of our evening together . " There was a second time , " I said . A sneer went to Ruta 's mouth . " Yes , the second time , " she said . " It burned . " " I 'm sorry , " I said . " Usually it burns . " " Perhaps you have an infection , " I said . " Ha , ha , " said Ruta , " that is just what 1 need . " " Is n't Kelly taking his time ? " 1 said suddenly . But suddenly I had felt his absence . " He went to look in on Deirdre , I would suppose . " I was tempted to ask if there was any way he could be listening . The room did not have that stricken air which recording devices brought to a mood , but then . . . " Is there any equipment ? " I asked  | " He had it taken out . " " He did ? Why ? " " Because one day I had the rare good fortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so was able to listen to him while he was having a conversation in the library . And I was enough impressed to turn on the tape recorder in the private cabinet . " " That was the day when you learned what you learned ? " " Yes , that was the day . " " It 's good enough to get you to marry him ? " " Maybe yes , maybe no . " " It 's probably good enough to get you hurt . " " Oh , " she said , " I have copies of the tape well secured . " " One wants to treat you well , " I said . " Thank you , " she said . " But that does not produce my assistant . " " Tell me your information . Who knows what that will produce ? " She laughed . " Who knows ? It is so good you must trust me . " I laughed . " Perhaps I do n't have to trust you . Perhaps I have anidea of your information . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know what she was talking about ; yet I had an intimation that I did , as if once again , somewhere deep within , a messenger was setting out . But now I did not want to talk . Which is to say there was some injunction in my brain not to proceed . It was as if I had spent my life living in a cellar , and now lights were being installed . But I had lived too long without them . The desire to go outside and walk on the parapet came again . " Let 's put brandy on the curse , " I said . Something had certainly happened . Quietly , mildly , without a backward look at Deirdre , I had decided to drink . We were drinking thus quietly  --  each waiting for the other to speak first  --  when Kelly came back . " Is Deirdre still restless ? " asked Ruta.  | " Very much so . " " I will see if I can get her to sleep , " Ruta offered . Now Kelly and I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search my face . " I lave a talk ? " " All right . " " You ca n't imagine this day . " he rubbed his eyes . " I suppose you 've had your moments , too . " I did not answer . Kelly nodded once . " Carloads of people here . Friends , enemies , the lot . I 've just left word downstairs  --  no one is to be let up . But then it 's probably too late anyway . What time do you have ? " " After two . " " Thought it was close to dawn . Are you all right ? " " I do n't know . " " I do n't really either . I 've hardly felt a thing all day . Bust into tears once . What with all the people here , I was somehow expecting Deborah to pop up for a drink , when wham ! " he said softly , " it hit me  --  no more Deborah . " He nodded . " You 're still numb , are n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deborah and me , I ca n't pretend . " " To your credit to admit it , I suppose . I always thought you were mad about her . " " I was for a long while . " " Hard not to . " " Yes . " " All the world 's certain you did her in . I spent the day telling people you did n't . " " Well , I did n't . " " I was n't sure myself . " " No , I did n't kill her . " " That 's good . That 's just as well . " " Yes , it is , considering the favor you did me . " " Let 's enjoy our drink , " Kelly said . " I 'm numb , too . " In the silence , I helped myself to another brandy . I had beenp232dragging sobriety after me ; with the first taste of the new drink , I topped a hill : all the weight of my psyche was pulling me down the slope . I was suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to tell him the truth . " In fact , " he said , " it would n't matter so much if you had killed her . I 'm just as guilty , after all . " He rubbed his nose vigorously . " I was a brute to her . She visited that brutishness back on you . So it comes to the same thing in the end , does n't it ? " I could not think of an answer to this . Indeed , I had no idea what Kelly was up to . " You have n't said a word about the funeral , " he said . " No . " " Well , let me tell you . It 's going to be a small funeral , and we 'll bury Deborah in a nice place I 've picked  --  you were nowhere around this morning so I had to decide on it . It wo n't be hallowed ground of course , but it will be peaceable . " We exchanged a stare . When the silence which came off from me did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course . " " No . " " Is that what Deirdre was upset about ? " " I would think that 's what it was . " " Well , I want you to be there . I ca n't conceive of an explanationotherwise . " " You can tell people I 'm too broken to show . " " I do n't intend to tell them anything . I want you to stop being a bloody fool . You and me are going to stand side by side at the funeral . Otherwise , it 's hopeless . Everyone will be convinced you 're a murderer . " " Ca n't you understand , " I said , " that I really do n't care what people say . It 's gone a little too deep for that . " My hand was trembling . To steady myself , I said , " Besides , even if I go , they 'll still say I did it . " " Bother them all , there 's a critical difference in the way it 'll bep233said . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his foreheadgave a jump and began to pulse . " I never thought I 'd have to explain to you , " said Kelly , " that it does n't matter what is done in private . What is important is the public show  --  it must be flawless . Because public show is the language we use to tell our friends and enemies that we still have order enough to make a good display . That 's not so easy if you consider the general insanity of everything . You see , it does n't matter whether people think you killed Deborah , it matters only whether people are given the opportunity to recognize it 's been swept under the carpet , and you and I together are in control of the situation . If you do n't show , it will cause so much talk that you and me will never be able to get to the real thing . " " Which is ? " " That we become friends . " " Kelly , I realize this has been quite a day for you ... " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He looked about . " Come , let 's go into the library . " It was the largest chamber in the suite and served as an omnibus bedroom , sitting room and antique gallery for Kelly . " Come on , " he said , " we can talk better there . It 's a better place for what I have to say . You see , I want to tell you a long story . A long Godawful story . And the library is the place for it . It may not be your favorite room , but it certainly is mine . It 's the only thing still belongs to me in New York . " Ile had in fact a town house in the East Sixties but never entered it . The house was occupied as a sort of hospital by Deborah 's mother who was bedridden , profoundly separated from Kelly , and had not spoken to Deborah since we were married . " Very well . We might as well go in , " I said . But I did not want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In there , was a turn of mood as precise as the instant of entering a royal chapel , some dark chamber with reliquaries and monstrances ; indeed , just as one went in , there was a silver monstrance before a screen , silver-gilt , set with stones , the screen a tapestry of women inp234Elizabethan dress talking to a deer while a squire was in the act of encountering a nude maid who grew out of the trunk of a tree . That was late sixteenth century . ( Kelly , on one half-genial occasion , had spent an evening cataloguing the items for me  --  " Who knows , you may own them someday , " he had said . " Must n't sell them for too little . " ) There was a harpsichord giving off the high patina of a snake ; a carved and gilt side-table with four golden alligators for legs ; a rug covered the floor with a purple-red landscape of trees and garden which glowed like a fire of permanganate . There was a looking-glass frame : ormolu cupids , scallop shells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides of a pondlike mirror and formed a crest at the top . It was eight feet high . So might a mouse begin to study the privates of a queen . There was more : a Lucchese bed with a canopy encrusted in blood-velvet and gold ; next to it , a Venetian throne . Golden mermaids twined up the arms to the shield at the head . The sculpture was delicate , but the throne seemed to grow as one regarded it for the sirens and cupids slithered from one to another like lizards on the vines of a tree : in the high silence of this room there was all but the sound of vegetation working in the night . Kelly sat down on the throne , leaving me to sit in some uncomfortable but exceptional antique of a chair , a small inlay table of Chinese ivory between us , and since there was almost no light in the room , just the small glow from the fire , and the illumination of a small lamp , I could see very little , the room was suspended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was feeling wretched , twice wretched , in some rack of exhaustion between apathy and overstimulation . Nothing seemed here and present , not Deborah 's death , nor guilt , nor his suffering  --  if he felt any  --  nor mine : I did not know if I was real any longer , which is to say I did not feel connected to myself . My mind brought too much fever to each possibility . I felt once again as I had felt on entering the Waldorf , that I was in some antechamber of Hell where objects came alive and communicated with one another whilep235I sank with each drink into a condition closer to the objects . There was a presence in the room like the command of a dead pharaoh . Aristocrats , slave owners , manufacturers and popes had coveted these furnishings until the beseechments of prayer had passed into their gold . Even as a magnet directs every iron particle in a crowd of filings , so a field of force was on me here , an air rich with surfeit and the long whisper of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burgundy and wild boar went down . That same field of force had come on me as I left Deborah 's body on the floor and started down the stairs to the room where Ruta was waiting . " Do you mind if I get some drink ? " " Please help yourself . " I was out of the room and to the bar in the next room , and having filled a tall glass with many cubes and several inches of gin , I drank deep , the gin going down like a cleansing fire . There was something wrong but I could not place it : I felt particularly unarmed . And then remembered . There was Shago 's umbrella . It was in a corner of the first closet I searched , and the handle came into my palm : grasping the umbrella I felt stronger now , like a derelict provided with a cigarette , a drink , and a knife . Thus braced , I went back . He saw me with the umbrella . I made no attempt to hide it , sitting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked . I nodded . As though testing the plumps of a breast , he palmed both hands about the snifter ; then looked off into the darkness . I became aware of a log still going in the fireplace , and Kelly got up this time and threw a new log on and poked the first with an intimate jab , as if he were waking an old stubborn hound . " Bess tell you about her romance with me ? " he asked . " She said something about it . " " Due to Bess , I lost the upbringing of Deborah . " " Deborah never told me. "  | " I 've never talked about myself to anyone , " Kelly said . " I detest that . It 's spilling the seed . But I have wanted to talk to you . You see Deborah used to give me a hint of your beliefs . I was taken with your declaration  --  did you really make it on television ?  --  that God 's engaged in a war with the Devil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An idea came to get up , make farewells , and depart , simple as that . The room , however , was a weight on my will . " I 'm not up to a discussion , " I said . And I was n't . Tonight I had a terror of offending God or the Devil . " Of course . " But there was contempt , as if the real mark was to chat at the cliffside of a disaster . " Well , " he sighed , " it 's all in curioustaste , I know , but I like teasing the Jesuits with your idea . I get them to admit that the Devil in such a scheme has to have an even chance to defeat the Lord , or there 's no scheme to consider . Of course the off-shoot of this hypothesis , I point out , is that the Church is an agent of the Devil . " He looked up as if to call for a question and I , to be polite , answered , " Do I follow you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory of Satan , man believes that God is all-powerful . So man also assumes God is prepared to forgive every last little betrayal . Which may not be the case . God might be having a very bad war with troops defecting everywhere . Who knows ? Hell by now might be no worse than Las Vegas or Versailles . " He laughed . " Good Lord and gravy , does that put a Jesuit 's nose out of joint . I must say they ca n't come back too hard with their legendary counterattack , because I have money to dangle . One of them , however , got brave enough to say , If the Church is the agent of the Devil , Oswald , why in damnation do you donate so much ? ' and of course I could not keep from replying , Well , for all we know , I am a solicitor for the Devil . ' " " But you really think so . " " On occasion , I 'm vain enough . " We took a pause on this.  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I asked . " Why should I ? I 'm a grand Catholic . Much more amusing . Then I 'm hardly typical . My Kellys came from North Ireland . Oswald derives from Presbyterians . It was n't until the question of marrying Deborah 's mother came up that I decided Paris was worth a Mass . Certainly was . Kelly converted and climbed the stairs . Now , I 've got stories , " he said . " Once you 're located where I am , there 's nothing left but to agitate the web . At my worst , I 'm a spider . I-Iave strings in everywhere from the Muslims to the New York Times . Just ask me . I 've got it . " " Got the CIA ? " Put a finger to his lips at the directness of the remark . " Threads . " " And Mr. Ganucci 's friends ? " " Lots of knots , " said Kelly . The fire blazed in a back-draft , and he looked at me . " Ever realize how carnivorous the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no answer . I was thinking of the parapet . It was conceivable he was thinking of it as well . " Rojack , I 'm not as powerful as you think , " said Kelly . " I dabble . It 's the hardworking fellow at the desk who has the real power . The career man . " He said this with easy candor , ready to laugh at me , but whether for believing him , or whether for not believing him , was precisely the little difference I could not detect . " Are you altogether comfortable ? " he asked . I shifted in my seat . " Not much of my story is pretty , " he said . " But then I 've warned you . Look , " he added , " it 's a full warning . I 'm putting a weight on you . I think everyone must tell his real little buried story sooner or later . He must pick out somebody to tell it to . But I did n't know who to tell it to . Tonight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SuddenlyI knew . You 're the one . " Ile looked at me . A hint of gray ice in a river came out of the core of his heartiness . " With your permission.  |p238I  nodded . I had become aware again of the darkness . We sat like two hunters in the midnight of a jungle . Kelly 's voice , however , was genial . " You know I was a simple young man when I was young , " he said . " Grew up in Minnesota , youngest child in a large family , worked on farms , grocery store after school , all of that . Deborah ever tell you ? " " Others have . " " They could n't know the details . We were poor as rats . But my father had pretensions , North Irish Kellys , after all . We even had a coat of arms , hurrah . Gules , a child proper . Can you conceive of a shield with nothing but a naked babe in it ? That was us . I managed to take the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I decided to consolidate the arms . Leonora was ready to have a fit . She tried to fight it clear across the seas to the College of Arms . But then of course by that time Leonora and I had been at war for years . " " Deborah never talked about any of this . " " Well . I wo n't bore you too much . I 'll just say I had three thousand dollars in capital after World War One  --  the savings of my entire family . My father used to keep his green in an old cheesebox in a locked drawer . I got hold of that package and went to Philadelphia , hopped all over the place in Army Surplus . Blew up the three thousand dollars to one hundred thousand dollars in one year , not saying how . Gave my family five thousand back since they 'd been nice enough not to scream for the sheriff . Then in two years on the market , I poked the ninety-five thousand up to one million . Explode a miser like my father and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my gift , my investments were n't brilliant , you see , they just kept winning . Scared me stiff . I was just a poor hick Presbyterian . " A change had come over him . It was obvious he loved to tell a story . His voice rounded into humors , his manner became embracingp239yet impersonal as if he were the master of an exceptional treat which soon would be offered you . " Well , then I met Leonora . I was set up in business in Kansas City . Grain futures , owned divvies on a movie theatre , put up money with a bully who was starting an interstate trucking concern , and still kept running a wild streak on the market , skipping from one teeter-totter of margin to another . Got into something with Leonora 's father . There was a gent ! Sicilian aristocrat , raised in Paris . Now marooned in Kansas City . Poor bastard had been penniless , you gather , when he married into the bullion . So even though he was just about the grandest item in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. to run their meat-packings , British money in Midwestern meat then  --  well , this may be going on , I know , but I ca n't dive at once into the center of this little tale  --  it 's too rough . " He threw me a quick hard look . " At any rate , Signor and I got along very well , thank you , and he came up with the idea of marrying me to Leonora , a great surprise , for he was ferociously snob , but it was his revenge , I would bet , on the Caughlins . They looked for nothing but the grandest with their granddaughter . So , too , I 'm sure , did Mangaravidi , but he was able to convince himself that Oswald 's Kellys were grafted stock of the Windsor vine . I did n't try to unconvince him that 1 was no royal bastard . " On the other hand , 1 did n't take altogether to Leonora . She was a devout . Pretty girl , but completely spooked . Used to wear a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balls . Kept a saint in every pocket . A bacchanal for a young man , was n't she just ! But I had learned ' the first thing about mazuma . There are dollars which buy a million 's worth of groceries , and dollars which have influence . The Caughlins had the second kind of grabbings , 1 had the first . So I paid court to Leonora for a year , and captured her with my conversion . In marrying me , she felt she was bringing a soul to the Church . Her little view of marriage . We did it . And I discoveredp240myself up to here in a dank tank . I did n't know marbles about sex , I just knew something was damn bloody wrong . Why , we had n't been married a year before our mutual antipathy was so perfect a room was spoiled if the other had been in it five minutes before . On top of that , Leonora could not conceive , so it seemed  --  I had nightmaresthe Romans would give her an annulment . No need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself ; I needed to be married to her long enough to lay out a thorough circuit of connections . Without her , I was upstart , whereas with her  --  I adored the life she opened , Leonora 's friends were the patch for me . Money which can not buy into the most amusing world is cabbage , stinking stifling cabbage , that much I knew at twenty-three . " He took another sip . " Well , B. Oswald Kelly said to himself , Napoleon , the armies must occupy the womb . ' And we did . My troops made one do-johnny of a march . On a given night , in an absolute eczema of flesh , whipping myself up with the fancy I was giving a poke to some poor flunky , I drilled my salt into her , I took a dive deep down into a vow , I said in my mind ; Satan , if it takes your pitchfork up my gut , let me blast a child into this bitch ! ' And something happened , no sulphur , no brimstone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bog , some place awful , and I felt something take hold in her . Some sick breath came right back out of her pious little mouth . What the hell have you done ? ' she screamed at me , which was the only time Leonora ever swore . That was it . Deborah was conceived . " There was no answer I could give . I knew his story was true . The umbrella lay like a sleeping snake across my thighs . " I 've read a bit about the saints , " said Kelly , " you 'd be surprised . If a saint has his vision , he is next bothered with devils . The Devil 's first joy is to pick up a saint  --  at least that 's what I would do . And the return payment , I expect , is that the Lord 's first attention is toward us little devils . I can only testify that I was never so fond of Leonora as during that pregnancy . Oh , God , ' I used to pray before sleep ,  |p241have  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have damned the creature before it began . ' And there would be times when I would put my hand on Leonora 's belly , and feel everything which was best in me pass through my fingers into that creature sleeping in her mother 's waters . What do you think came out ? An absolute marvel of an infant . Almost died in birth . They had to slice Leonora nearly in half to spring the baby , but Deborah had eyes which took you on a trip through real estate ! "  --  he laughed  --  " right through glens and dells her eyes took you , and a corps de ballet of elves and spirits to take nips of your vision as you went in . That child would laugh like a fifty-year-old beer drinker , brawny little thing , laugh the devil right back at you for trying to see into her . I never adored anything as I adored that infant . Excuse me , " he said , " for not obeying the pact , " and began to weep . I all but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up as though to avoid such a gesture and moved toward the fire . A minute went by . " Well , " he said over his shoulder , " you strike a bargain with the Devil , the Devil will collect . That 's where Mephisto is found . In the art of collection . Trust me : Leonora was in bad shape after the birth , gutted , all of that . 1 did n't care , I had the infant  --  that was my connection to good luck . But we thought we might go to the Riviera while she mended , and I had friends enough I wanted to make on that glorious piece of coast . So 1 tidied up my affairs in Kansas City , took a back seat in the trucking firm  --  which incidentally I 've still got ; it became an enormous lion , thanks to the bully  --  sold for a loss here , grabbed a profit there , and we were off . I knew enough to know the pots to be investigated . And I made a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever did business with blue water and smell of sun in the nose . Tastes pop up in you on that Mediterranean . Everybody is looking for their very special little pleasure and I was n't ready to find all my joys in the infant , I wanted a bit more , damn sure I was entitled to more . Then along came Bess , the Devil 's little gift . Shep242was in from New York to spend a season in her villa  --  at the time I thought it was the most stunning house I 'd ever seen  --  she owned a Raphael , that sort of nonsense . " Actually the house was a groaning display , too many floors put down in marble , Burne-Joneses lit with candles , homosexual sculpture  --  fatlittle cupids with pointy little pricks and bottoms like a chorus girl  --  froufrou in her bedroom , lily pads in the pond , obscene rubber trees . Even a scorpion she kept in a glass cage . She had no taste . But she was grand , grander than anything I 'd ever seen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of forty , though she did n't look it a bit , and I was n't twenty-five . She had an awful reputation , four marriages , three children , lovers in every corner , anything you wanted , from an Egyptian with a cellar full of whips to a young American racing car specialist . And unbelievable stories about her , way off my spectrum , for Bess was petite , just as lovely as an orchid . Very elusive of course , you could turn to get a drink and she 'd disappearedfrom the room , but her air was exquisite . She had a delicatehumor . I could n't digest the awful stories about her , but I had to swallow some part of them , because Bess was in communion with something . You did n't have amour with her , you had some species of interplay . Messages went back and forth  --  it was the first time I ever understood there is a hocus-pocus of the cells . Something astral in her , or whatever , was avid to snatch up bits of me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my pigeons , so to speak . Then afterwardsshe 'd fly them back  --  the loan was returned  --  but something had been added , something foreign . I felt as if I now too was in touch with forces I would just as soon have left alone . Mangaravidi had a bit of that  --  I always believed he was a hussar of the ghosts , but Bess was queen of the spooks . Never met anyone so telepathic . If there had n't been Marconi she would have been the one to dream up the radio . I remember one time we were in her garden and she asked for a five-franc piece . Soon as I gave it to her she zipped into her bag , pulled out a nail scissors , and clipped a couple of hairs fromp243my head . Then she bent down , scooped up a stone from the bottom of a rubber tree , set the five-francker on top of the hairs and put back the stone . ' Squeaks , ' she said , ' 1 might be able to hear you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was n't that funny  --  the tree stood there like a statue . And now Bess began to have a way of telling me all about private conversations I 'd had with Leonora , or worse : she 'd tell me some of my own little thoughts . Given that damn tree , I was directly in her power . I thought myself a competitivefellow , just consider  --  I had to be nearly as supersensational with sex as I was with dinero , and Bess and I gave each other some gloriousgood times in a row ; up would climb the male ego ; applause from Bess was accolade from Cleopatra ; then swish ! she 'd vanish . Gone for a day or week . ' Had to , darling , ' she 'd say on her return , ' he was irresistible . ' Only to tickle my ego up again by confessing I was more irresistible , ergo she was back . Or to the contrary , she 'd leave me pulp ; she 'd say , Well , he 's gone , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halfway through a steak , have it snatched from him . She got me to the point where I could be in the middle of doing my work and all of a sudden 1 'd think , ' Bess is off with somebody . ' My brain would scoot out of me just as fast as feeder ants from a piece of carrion that 's just been kicked . I was carrion . I was in her damn grip . Intolerable . I was afraid of her . More afraid of her than I 'd been of anybody . Each time we got together I felt as if I were an open piggy-bank : had to take whatever she would drop into me ; her coin was powers . My nose for the market turned infallible . Lying in bed I could feel the potential of a given stock as much as if 1 were bathing in the thoughts of a thousand key investors . I could almost hear the sound of the mother factory . It was like soaking up a view . Then 1 would be left with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beethoven is going down . ' Whatever ! I was spoon-fed on expert opinion , of course , I was just about a clearinghouse for tips , but this went a distance beyond that , I promise you . And there were other spookeries . One time a buggerp244started to give me a hard time , pompous little promoter . As he was walking away , I said to myself , Drop , you bugger , ' and he had epilepsy right at my door . Wondrous sort of power . " Well , poco a poco , I started to trundle along on Bess 's extra ventures . They were wows . Had to talk my way out of a bad place or two  --  Bess was incorrigible . Only one thing could make her put on the brakes . She had a niece  --  her sister 's daughter  --  nineteen , virgin . Lovely girl . Bess adored her . Only thing she really cared about . The niece came for a visit and before you knew it the two women were up to the elbow . Inseparable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this put Bess at odds . A parting of the seas in her overcharged libido . Like Moses , I kept taking one nimble step after another into the Red Divide . I headed right for the heart of the problem , as if the way to get thumbs on Bess was to make her girl fall in love with me . I did not even know if I did this at Bess 's bidding , or against her will , but we certainly came closer and closer all of us to the jewels . Then , one night , one more or less pregnant night in Bess 's boudoir , the three of us sat about for hours . Bess was drinking a little , I was drinking a lot , this girl was sipping champagne . The longer we tried to make small talk , the more powerful became the itch to set off an earthquake . After awhile , we all got silent . There was gunpowder in the nostrils . And a whiff of somethingghoulish . As if we breathed a winding sheet to and fro . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the move , and yet my bones were soup  --  look , " said Kelly , holding up his palm , " let me give the truth : the girl was not a niece but a daughter , Bess 's little girl whom she had lost by divorce years ago . I had the feeling that to say a word would strike a match , and yet to quit the game at this extraordinarymoment would deprive me of my strength . Afraid to go on , afraid to quit , we just sat in a furnace . And dear Bess melted first . She gave me the wink . I got up on the spot , it was too much , she had suggested it five minutes too soon . I bolted . Ran downstairs to have a drink by myself . Made a vow I 'd give Bess up . Started top245leave her house . But on the way through the garden , I thought of that rubber tree , and knew I could n't go away while Bess still kept her little ear beneath the stone . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you dare , ' I heard Bess say clearly , even though she was nowhere about . " ' Damn you , ' I said back , and picked up the stone , stuck the franc piece in my pocket , kicked the hole with the toe of my shoe to scatter the bits of hair , and off I went . I had n't taken five steps before I knew I 'd never make it , I 'd pass out . So back plunged Kelly , took the first bathroom he could find on the ground floor , and proceeded to get sick as a boy with his first bottle of whiskey . There on my knees at that moment , pinching the five-franc piece as if it were all the riches I had , in slavery to the plumbing , I heard , clear across town , a sound of Deborah screaming . What screams ! I saw flames as clear as a movie film on Bess 's bathroom wall , flames licking at Deborah 's crib . My house was on fire , I was convinced . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got across town as ever fast I could , I do n't know if I 've ever driven so fast , and what do you think ? Our house was perfectly all right . It was only the house next door which was on fire . A total conflagration . No one knew how it started , either . And Deborah was screaming in her crib . " That was warning enough . I sat down with Leonora to make a complete confession . And she  --  1 should have known it  --  went into hysterics . Next morning was disaster . Hess 's daughter had a breakdownin the night : she carried on . The servants heard a bit of it . Result : Antibes heard all of it . We were shunned . You can make any kind of splash you want in that world , but keep the water clear of mud . Leonora took off and left me . Took Deborah with her . Forbid a divorce , forbid all right to the child . I was not allowed to see Deborah again until she was eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw her until she was fifteen . " I Ie took a breath and stared at the fire . " I had a lot to think about . I 'd never been so tempted in my life as I was that night . I kept being bothered by the thoughtp246that if I had taken a chance , I would have had the opportunities of a president or a king . " He took a deep pull of his brandy . " I decided the only explanation is that God and the Devil are very attentive to the people at the summit . I do n't know if they stir much in the average man 's daily stew , no great sport for spooks , I would suppose , in a ranch house , but do you expect God or the Devil left Lenin and Hitler or Churchill alone ? No . They bid for favors and exact revenge . That 's why men with power sometimes act so silly . Kaiser Wilhelm , for example . There 's nothing but magic at the top . It 's the little secret a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my friend , is one reason it 's not easy to get to the very top . Because you have to be ready to deal with One or the Other , and that 's too much for the average good man on his way . Sooner or later , he decides to be mediocre , and put up with the middle . I know I was ready . Incest is the gate to the worst sort of forces , and I 'd had my belly-full early . " Kelly sighed . " The experience put me off sex for years . " " That 's not your reputation . " " I have a late reputation , " said Kelly . " But I was a good boy for quite a period . Very good I was . Then I got custody . Know why ? " " Why ? " " Leonora was broke . Figure-toi . All that bloody Catholicism . She could n't take a deep breath until the saints were put to bed ; nonetheless , she lost almost half of her inheritance in the market , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on principal . She 'd never taken a cent from me , but now she needed the stuff . Turned out Leonora loved cabbage more than morals . In return for a large piece of cash , I got full custody of Deborah . In fact the girl and her mother could n't bear each other . Leonora had stashed her in a convent . Now Deborah and I had a home . " " Then what ? " I asked . " Happy times , " he said . He looked away . " Of course one does well not to talk of that . Not tonight . But I was happy until Deborahp247got married to Pamphli . Mind you , I did like him , Pamphli was a bit in the style of Mangaravidi . But he was much too old for her and ill . Well , let 's not talk about bad parts . " " Deborah told me Pamphli was a fine hunter . " I was making conversation  --  I was uneasy . I did not know if the story were finishedor half-begun . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did actually take her all the way over to Africa for the honeymoon , but Deborah did most of the bush work with the guide . They were n't out long . Pamphli was too sick . Besides , Deborah was having a damn sick time with Deirdre . " " Then she was pregnant when they married ? " " Afraid she was . " He shifted irritably . " Now what the hell do you want to know ? " he asked . He was about to shut down on the British accent . " Who Deirdre 's father might be . " " You do n't suppose Deborah advertised every last little fling , do you ? " But in saying this , her death opened again between us . " All right , " he said , " there 's a little more of the story . Ca n't conceal it from you , can I ? " I le threw me a look , almost a jeering look . " You see , by the time Deborah came to live under my roof , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nothing but soul and business without getting fairly rich . 1 did n't smoke , booze never . Let me tell you , boy , in a situation like that , it 's hard not to keep making new boodles . On the one hand , you 're clear-minded . On the other  --  you would have to hurt a great many people 's feelingsnot to fall on another buried treasure every six months , because they 're begging you to take it , take their money , take their invention , take their export license , take their wife , slip it up grandmother , they are sordid with eagerness . You get bored . A rich man can not afford that  --  his boredom is infinite in its dimensions . So I looked for diversion . Bought into a news magazine , I think you
