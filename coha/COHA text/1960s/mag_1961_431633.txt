 | Why Inventing Is Still a One-Man Job @# O NE of the surprises of modern industrial life is the relatively small contribution of large industrial corporations to the sum total of significant creative and new ideas . Historically , important new ideas have come through individual initiative . They have come less often from the laboratories of our great industrial corporations . They have not come from committees , they have not come from teamwork , they have not come from organization ; but . in very large part , they have come from individuals , often working almost alone and , very frequently , under surprising and often unpromising conditions . Despite the tremendous size , power , and wealth of our largest industrial firms , and despite the fact that they are totally immersed in technology , their contributions have been far greater in production and in marketing than in creativity . I am convinced , both by history and by present circumstances , that this is not likely to change . It will not be changed by " brainstorming " or " pyramiding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A disproportionately large quota of new ideas will continue to come from individuals . The large industrial giants will continue in their roles as developers rather than creators , as producers rather than as innovators . HISTORY , sociology , and what I term " accident " account 1 1 for this . This is not to say that corporations have invented nothing . There have been important inventions by men working within American big business . The transistor resulted from idea suggested by Dr. Shockley at the Bell Laboratories . o Freon refrigerants came from Midgely after he went to work for General Motors . Nylon was originated by a man in the Engineers . DuPont laboratories . There are others . The modern corporation has often been superb in development and improvement . But the creative idea is something else . It is the pregnant suggestion that sets in motion a whole series of new consequences . One consequence is the development , improvement , refinement , manufacture , and marketing of the product that rests on the idea . For history , let 's look at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invented by Watt , and the steamboat by Fulton . The telegraph was invented by Samuel Morse , the cotton gin by Eli Whitney . And , of course , Edison invented the incandescent lamp , the phonograph , and the moving picture . The first significant breakthrough in the making of steel was by Bessemer . The steam turbine came from Parson . The process of refining and producing aluminum , still used to-@#  | day , was invented privately by Hall and Cowles in the United States and , almost simultaneously , by Heroult in France . A salesman for bottle stoppers invented the safety razor . His name was Gillette . Wireless was invented by Marconi . It was not the telephone company or General Electric or Westinghouse that invented the three-element vacuum tube . This was the work of Lee de Forest . The modern plastics industry began with Dr. Baekeland and Bakelite . Perhaps these things are too old to be relevant today . Very well , insulin was discovered in the 1920s not by anyone in a great pharmaceutical house but by Dr. Banting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penicillin . Streptomycin was found by Dr. Waksman , polio vaccine by Dr. Salk . The gyrocompass , so important to our rocketry , was invented by a German named Anschutz-Kaempfe . Frequency modulation was invented not by RCA but by Dr. Armstrong . Kodachrome film was invented not by the Eastman company but by Godowsky and Mannes , who did much of their early work in a kitchen sink . The Polaroid camera was invented by Dr. Land , whose early work on polarizing films was done when he was 20 years old and still a student at Harvard . Stainless steel was developed not by any of the major steel companies but by two scientific entrepreneurs , Harry Brearley and Elwood Haynes . The cotton picker was invented not by International Harvester but by the Rust brothers . Cellophane was not the invention of the Du Pont company but of a Swiss-born Frenchman , Jacques Brandenberger . I N THE field of nuclear development , it was Ernest Lawrence , University of California scientist , who invented the cyclotron . The major inventions for the atomic bomb and much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bohr , Enrico Fermi , Edward Teller , Harold Urey , and Leo Szilard. @#  | The automobile ? A number of major inventions stem from ideas within the industry . The outstanding one is the automatic transmission , initiated by Thompson while he was at Cadillac and carried by him to Oldsmobile . ( The hydraulic torque converter , however , was the work of individuals not associated with any large firm . ) Duco body finishing was invented by Du Pont . The sealed-beam headlight came from within the industry . But the four-cycle engine was Otto 's , of Germany , and the two-cycle Dr. Diesel 's . Vulcanized rubber was the invention of a man named Goodyear and the pneumatic tire of an Englishman , Dr. Dunlop . The self-starter was invented by Vincent Bendix , and by Kettering before he became associated with General Motors . Four-wheel hydraulic brakes were invented by Loughead. power steering by Davis , and chromium plating by Dr. Fink , a professor at Columbia . SO MUCH for history . The second reason that the individual inventor will continue to bulk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Critics ( with whom I do n't agree ) have observed that the giant corporations have indulged in welfarism , particularly for the supervisory classes , to a degree beyond the dream of any Utopian socialist . They say that the brass , including many engineers , of today 's big industrial firms is weaned , fed , clothed , schooled , doctored and hospitalized , has his adult being in , and can be buried without leaving , the comfortable company corridor . Let him make the company 's first team , and the likelihood of his ever getting fired is remote indeed . What has such a man to gain by propounding an original idea ? Not much . His sure path to success lies in being a good little cooperator and keeping his nose clean . So say the critics . They may expose a grain of truth in a Sahara of unrestraint . But there are at least four more valid reasons that prevent a factory from being a fertile ground for creative ideas . The basic purpose of a factory is to produce . To produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new ideas along the way disrupts them . Again , a big factory must avoid mistakes . If I am building a boat in my basement and put a hole in the wrong place , I can plug it and paint it over . But if I am producing 3,000 automobiles a week and put a hole in the wrong place , in a week 's time I have a major crisis . It takes a lot of nerve to change things in a factory . Creativity also involves emotional costs which most managements can not and will not accept . Every innovator is an iconoclast . His new idea is an attack on an older idea . Through extension , it seems like an attack on the men who are in charge of the old idea ? which means the men who are in charge of almost everything . THE oddball innovator is disturbing . His habits do n't fit into a smooth-running organization . I learned this rather poignantly when , as a division manager for a large corpor- R 1961  | ation , I reached the limit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been timed by a sun dial in cloudy weather . Sometimes he arrived at 10 and sometimes at noon . He was as bright as any engineer we had , and often he worked late into the night . But his unreliability was just too much . Three years after I fired him , he had made several million dollars from one of his inventions . Personnel-testing schemes are now arranged to screen out such men . Not every inventor , of course , insists on dressing like a Californian . But there are enough pressures and problems in a big factory without adding the disturbing nature of the oddballs ' creative contributions . It is necessary to distinguish between some of these facts of business life and the public-relations utterances about our zeal for progress . Because of these statements , I think many commentators have been misled . The fact is that there are important pressures against innovation and that they are highly concentrated in any hard-working productive enterprise . I mean no disrespect to General Electric , which , in fact , has done a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firms " Progress is our most important slogan " ? and little more . Finally , I venture the suggestion that our big corporations do n't really need to innovate . When they do , they take risks which they can avoid by depending less upon creativity and more upon size , momentum , organization , skill , and advertising . We come now to the third and last basic reason why I believe our big corporations will not come to dominate creativity as they dominate the market place . That lies in " accident . " Invention defies planning . It is simply not possible to corral into industrial research laboratories any but a small fraction of the men who contribute the significant ideas . I refer to two kinds of accident . The first is the legendary accidental invention ? like Dr. Fleming 's observation of an unusual mold in a culture plate that turned out to be penicillin . The other kind of accident is in the nature of the nonprofessional inventor ,  | As observed by Jewkes , Sawers , and Stillerman in The Sources of Invention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not as a technician ; Midgely was a mechanical engineer , not a chemist ; the men who invented color film were not chemists but musicians ; inventor of the ball-point pen had n at various times a painter , sculptor , journalist ; Dunlop was a veterinarian ; and the inventor of the dial telephone was an undertaker . If the director of a modern research laboratory had hired this motley crew to work on the kinds of things they invented , he would have been fired . It IS important that our big businesses welcome new ideas . I find much of American business far less receptive to w ideas than the businesses of Europe . long as our conservatism is confined our business organizations , I do not r any desiccation of - the wellspring of creativity from individuals . The danger lies in this : that the organizers , who in business keep the innovators in their place , may extend their dominion to society at large . This could lead to economic stagnation and , more important , to the atrophy of the creative spirit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can help itself by improving the climate for their growth within business . It can help itself much more by opening its doors to creative individuals outside the walls . As a lawyer , I have written some of the documents that inventors are required to sign before their inventions will be considered . I know something about the kind of reception that inventors usually receive . I think that our corporations are lawyer-ridden . There is far more concern to avoid a possible lawsuit than there is to get hold of a new idea . This , I think , has to change . Beyond this , I would urge the manager of any business who is really interested in new ideas to get a new crew of people to interview inventors . He should aso set aside an amount of money that he fully expects to lose . If a man is never explaining his failures because he has only successes , it means simply that he is not taking enough risk .                 @ @ @ @
