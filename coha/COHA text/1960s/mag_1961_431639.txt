 | THE AGONIES OF ALONENESS In a corner of a dark bedroom closet , in a three-year-old split-level house , a young housewife crouches like a small , frightened animal . Her husband pleads with her to tell him what is troubling her , but she will not speak . She stares out at him fearfully . Every time he reaches down to touch her , she shrinks away . She is terrified . People are staring at her , laughing at her , reading her mind . Voices from the walls are talking to her in angry tones . The authorities are looking for her . They are going to take her away somewhere and lock her up for her bad thoughts and for failing her husband and children ... . The case of Alice Hager , as we will call her , was one of a number involved in a five-year study of Bergen County in New Jersey , across the river from New York City . We made the survey to determine whether the suburban troubles and tensions you hear and read so much about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bergen County because it is typical of " get-ahead " communities everywhere ? growing fast , with many new . young families . The husbands and fathers ? many of whom commute to New York ? are on the way up economically . This is what can be called a mobile community , a community in social transition as opposed to a more stable , integrated ( closely knit ) community characterized by older , more established small towns in rural areas . Bergen County , like most of America 's suburban areas , is literally a community on the move ? a factor which , as we shall see , has a far-reaching effect on the lives of most of the people who live there . In comparing the new phenomenon of the mobile suburb with an older , more stable , more integrated area , we found that Bergen residents had to cope with more heart attacks , high blood pressure , ulcers , juvenile delinquency than did the residents of a rural county ? Cattaraugus , in New York . And Bergen had a higher rate of divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be taken as an indication that something must be troubling the people in Bergen . What are these troubles ? What is causing them ? And what can be done about them ? Beginning with the case of Alice Hager , here are our findings and what they can mean to you and your family . . . . Alice had been made sensitive by traumatic experiences in her childhood . She came from a small , stable Southern town and from an old American family that had suffered serious economic decline . Her mother . who was socially ambitious , fought bitterly over money with Alice 's father , who became an alcoholic and eventually died in a mental institution of cirrhosis of the liver . Going to work as a secretary when lack of money ruled out college , Alice met and married Carl Hager , a young engineer who liked to talk of theoretical and ethical aspects of science and enjoyed listening to chamber music . Son of a German immigrant and building contractor whose business had collapsed , Carl had a burning ambition to succeed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered a big promotion and a transfer to New York headquarters . Naturally , he accepted . He , Alice , and their two boys trekked north that autumn and settled in a new home in a suburb . TRANSFER TENSIONS . A transfer does not usually affect the husband as much as it does the wife and children . The husband , though he changes his domicile and his working location , remains in the same social organization : the company . But the wife is not so lucky , as Alice 's case proved . To her , the new neighbors did n't seem to be at all like the gracious , charming folk of her Southern girlhood . No one appeared to care much who Alice was ; in fact , few people seemed to have noticed that a new family had dropped into their midst . Life swirled around Alice ; everybody was too busy , too full of their own problems . too alien to understand , or , even if they did understand , to help her . Carl . also , was too busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late at night dead tired . And he usually brought home work on weekends . Fighting hard for further promotions , he was attending a university three nights a week , seeking his master 's degree . He seldom took Alice out , and spent very little time with his family . Feeling the walls closing in on her . Alice timidly inquired one day about the chances of joining the local women 's club , but she was told that some of the members intended to keep the new " riffraff " out . Alice considered her rejection by the club a personal affront . Meanwhile , her sons were growing progressively harder for her to manage . In her exasperation , Alice began to scream at them . One day one of them , in a temper tantrum , hit her on the cheek , leaving a large red bruise . When she told Carl , he seemed more angry at her than at the boy . He told her that raising the children was her responsibility . The town , which Alice had at first felt to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trampling on her . At the supermarket , women shoved ahead of her in the check-out lines . On the roads they swerved ahead of her , missing her fender by inches and not seeming at all apologetic . Tradesmen seemed eager to cheat her . She was up against the facts of life in a mobile town , a town in which people  | were on the move ? upward . They wanted to get ahead . They were overly aggressive and assertive . Alice let the mobile community walk all over her . She could n't make herself protest when a tradesman gave her inferior merchandise . When one of her sons broke a playmate 's bike , and the boy 's mother stormed across the street to demand that Alice pay for repairs , Alice meekly paid . When another neighbor 's children trampled through her flower beds and destroyed cultivated seedlings , Alice decided to say nothing . In her loneliness , with too little encouragement , and too few others to tell her that she was doing a good job or to help her do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Carl suggested often ? she was a failure as wife and mother . She realized that she nagged more than she once had , and she recognized that a whining note had crept into her voice . Were these things making her less attractive to Carl ? THE CLOSING TRAP . Alice felt really trapped in the house now ; she could n't even chat very often with the few neighbors she liked . Her head throbbed with the clunk-clunk of the washing machine , the yowl of the vacuum cleaner , and the shrill voices of the children . She realized , with bitterness , that her high-school and secretarial-school education were not serving her . In her present role , she felt , she need hardly have gone beyond the sixth grade . She desperately needed stimulation and challenge . Alice yearned to go back to the warm , friendly town of her girlhood . She asked Carl several times whether there was any chance he might be transferred back to the South , but he shook his head irritably . Perhaps , Alice thought , he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to move ahead ; she wanted to go back . She wondered whether she should take her weight from his shoulders . One afternoon , in a fit of weeping , Alice began to pack a suitcase , intent on fleeing to the South and her mother . Then , called suddenly to the school to deal with one of her sons who had thrown a temper tantrum and kicked a teacher , Alice dashed into the principal 's office carrying the suitcase she had packed . People looked at it , and at her , questioningly . When she realized what she had done , she thought desperately , Am I going out of my mind ? Steadily Alice 's emotional turmoil grew worse , feeding on itself . She had two acute anxiety attacks in the supermarket ? fits of dizziness that came on when women accidentally bumped into her . She took their acts to be deliberate , and hostile , and fear symptoms followed automatically . After the dizziness subsided , she noticed that people were staring at her , whispering to each other about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . Then the last blow hit Alice . Her mother died . She felt completely alone , abandoned on an inimical shore . TERROR AT A RED LIGHT . The thought of going to the supermarket now became almost intolerable for Alice . She forced herself to go , feeling that if she did n't prepare the family 's meals she would lose the last tenuous hold she had on Carl and the boys . One day , driving home , she accidentally went through a traffic light as it was turning red . She did n't notice the light until she was halfway across the intersection , - for her mind was on other things . Horns blared at her . Frightened , afraid that the police would chase her , she began to race homeward . Her mind was in such turmoil that by the time she was halfway home she was no longer sure why the police were after her . To Alice it seemed that the authorities were coming to punish her for failing her family . Panic-stricken , Alice drove the car into the driveway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She crawled into a closet and hid in the darkness , shivering with terror , waiting for " them " to come and get her . Fearful hallucinations can easily develop in anyone in so highly agitated a state . Alice was concentrating so hard on her own fears and anxieties that the outer world became less real to her . Her attention was drawn into herself , and the things she noticed there seemed starkly real . It is n't hard to understand why she began to hear voices telling her she was no good . A NEED FOR TOUGHNESS . This is what happened to one woman who came , ill-prepared , into the mobile , upward-moving society typical of many of today 's new suburbs . It did not support her in her role as housewife and mother . It expected her to support herself . She needed to be firm , tough and self-reliant . She was not equipped to be any of these things , for they had not been necessary in the stable society of her girlhood . Lacking the right equipment , Alice collapsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapse , for few are as highly sensitized by earlier experiences and by constitution as Alice is . But for many , the same stresses that bore on Alice are real and painful . The mobile life is more difficult to handle than she had ever realized . Alice eventually found her way back to happiness ; her story was tragic , nonetheless . It was tragic because all the pain and all the struggle were unnecessary . Alice could have avoided unhappiness if she had recognized that life in the mobile suburbs would be different from that in the quiet town of her girlhood , and if she had prepared herself for that difference .  | The suburban wife has no monopoly on the troubles in our new , mobile society . Her husband moves in a society that seemingly compels him to improve his income regularly , to drive ahead , to never sit back in satisfaction . Success is defined as upward movement . Failure is defined not as poverty , not as losing one 's shirt , but as lack of movement . To get ahead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oldest and dearest friends , abandon a house on which he has labored with pride and love , and neglect his wife and children . He may do all this reluctantly and unhappily , but with the firm conviction that he is doing what is best . SICKNESS AND STATUS . Working too hard , worried about his family , hounded by fear , unable to relax , the suburban fast-climbing husband is not as happy ? or as healthy ? a man as he might be . He contributes heavily to the fact that the proportion of coronary thrombosis patients at the Englewood Hospital , for example , is almost five times as large as at rural Olean General Hospital , and the proportion of duodenal ulcer patients is more than three times as great . Written into these disquieting statistics is the story of Fred Bright . He is a case of a tense man in a tense company . It examines some of the more common ways in which mobile men may be frustrated in their search for peace . It also illustrates one of the most common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychosocial process by which a man gets a peptic ulcer . Fred 's father , a small-town lumber dealer in the Midwest , passionately wanted his boys to go out into the world and make a name for themselves , and had made a great financial sacrifice to put them through college during the depression . When his father died of a heart attack . Fred , youngest of the brothers , had to leave college before graduating . He went to work as a salesman . When he was twenty-two he visited the state college for the graduation exercises of his former classmates , and at a sorority party he met a pretty blonde sophomore named Eve . Eve ? whose father was an automobile-plant foreman and whose mother was a part-time maid ? had come to college with one purpose in mind : to find a man . And as far as she and her parents were concerned , Fred was that man . With his glittering new car and his good job , this handsome , confident young man ? as Eve viewed him ? was already on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and they set up housekeeping outside Cleveland , Ohio . Two daughters and a son arrived quickly . Everything went well until Fred 's company merged with a larger one , and he was offered a choice : quit , or take another job at lower pay in the New York sales office . For Fred and Eve the speculative way of life now began in earnest . The New York transfer was a difficult adjustment for him , but through hard work he pushed his income back to its former level and beyond . Finally he was offered a minor executive job in the New York sales department . Fred was not quite ready for such a job ; but because to refuse promotion in the rush of modern industry often means to be shelved and because he badly needed the extra salary , he took the job anyway . He and Eve by this time had bought a house in the suburbs , a new load of furniture and appliances , a new car . They both had felt that Fred needed these things to maintain his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were overreaching their income . They still had no savings . FACADE OF CONFIDENCE . Thus Fred , having speculated in his buying of material things , was forced now to speculate in his acceptance of a job . Unsure of himself , Fred took a course in developing a magnetic personality , striving for the quickly acquired facade of confidence rather than for the real confidence that would have come more slowly from learning his job carefully . Fred 's facade of confidence was created for the same reasons as the facade of affluence that he and Eve were building around themselves in their suburban home community . It gave them quick status , instant recognition , but it was a precarious kind of status from which they could topple easily . From the start Fred made , mistakes in his new job . He grew tense and nervous while Eve , wanting to impress people with Fred 's new status and to win a little of the applause for herself , pushed for an even bigger house and a more costly car . Eve felt , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its climb . She wanted her children , as they grew up , to associate with the " best " children of the town . With new and growing pressures , it now seemed to Fred that he was always just one or two thousand dollars short of real security . Believing that if he could get hold of that much money in a lump , he could solve all his problems , he borrowed on his insurance and " took a flier " on some uranium stock for a dollar a share . When the stock , which was supposed to rise to at least two dollars within the following few months , sank to sixty cents , a margin call forced Fred to sell out ? creating an additional debt . Luckily , Fred was doing better on his job , but he was still under tension both in the office  | and at home . Eve , still having only limited success in breaking into the country-club set , was suffering from real or imagined rebuffs . Every weekend there were parties to which she and Fred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , critical and suspicious . She was very sharp when Fred came home smelling of alcohol after a drink at the bar with his boss , a colleague , or a customer . Fred was also troubled because he could not spend more time with his son ? a thin , moody boy , now aged nine . Fred Jr . appeared to be developing into a more or less general failure . DAUGHTERS AND DESIRE . Fred and Eve began , too , to have trouble with their daughters as the girls grew toward their teens . Eve was anxious for them to become as popular ? meaning attractive to boys ? as she had been . She would have been indignant to hear it said in so many words , but actually she was teaching her girls to concentrate on the use of sex to make their way in the world . Instead of learning to be useful to their family , society , and their future husbands , they were learning to cultivate a magnetic facade by means of which they , as their mother had done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the way up . As the girls became eager students of their mother 's teachings , the , parties in Fred 's living room occasionally became ominously quiet . When Fred came downstairs he would find all the lights out . He 'd switch them on , find the kids sitting two to a chair , the boys ' mouths smudged with lipstick . When Fred reprimanded his older daughter , she scornfully told him that he was hopelessly old-fashioned . Eve often sided with her daughter . A time came , however , when Eve switched on the living-room lights and saw an older boy hastily pull his hand out from under fourteen-year-old Fran 's skirt . Then Eve had angry words with her daughter , never stopping to think that the incident was the inevitable result of her own teachings and attitudes . The Brights ' younger daughter , Ginny , twelve , began to imitate her sister as she grew into adolescence . Now Fred worried every time his daughters were out of the house . He wondered what would happen if Fran or Ginny , experimenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should become pregnant . AN ULCER FOR DADDY . By the time he reached his early forties , Fred was a very tense man . He was beginning to have pains in his stomach and chest . The chest pains were sometimes accompanied by an alarming palpitation of the heart , and he remembered that his father had died of a heart attack . Actually , Fred was n't necessarily in danger of a heart attack , although he might have had an inherited predisposition and should have been taking particularly good care of his health as he grew older . The chest pains resulted from the simple fact that the muscles in his chest were chronically tense ; the pain was the ordinary ache of muscular fatigue . The heart palpitation was the result of fear : the fear of economic disaster that was always with him . It was exactly the same physical reaction that would arise in a man who rounds a corner and comes face to face with a tiger , but its cause was less obvious . Fred did not understand it , and thus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reality more serious than he thought . They were the beginnings of an ulcer . When a man is gripped by anger or fear , his body automatically makes ready for violent physical action ? fighting , running , climbing a tree . This is a marvelous mechanism . But it has no provision to accommodate itself to the needs of a man under chronic stress ? a man such as Fred Bright . When the key-up mechanism has been evoked too often or for too long , it may begin to harm the body which it was designed to help . Changes may take place in the stomach or intestinal walls , and the result may be that the stomach begins to digest itself . The digestive juices eat their way into the stomach or duodenal wall ; resulting in a peptic ulcer . Like many men , Fred tried to disregard the warning signals of his body 's barometer . He had been trained since boyhood to grit his teeth at the pain that indicates body tissues may be undergoing damage . But Fred 's pains eventually grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prescribed a rigorous diet and advised him to slow down . That was easy for the doctor to advise , but Fred was not in a position to slow down . He had his mortgage , his car payments , his life-insurance loan . his country-club dues , his other miscellaneous debts to pay off . He wanted to send his children to college . He wanted to hire a maid for Eve . Finally , one night , Fred began to vomit blood . He was rushed to a hospital , hemorrhaging internally . The ulcer had eroded a large blood vessel . Bleeding heavily and in shock , Fred was a critically ill man . Thus the speculative way of life , nurtured in " disturbia , " brought a hard-working young man to death 's door . There are hundreds of thousands , possibly millions , of Freds in the nation 's suburbs . In boom times , they are pushed into jobs without adequate preparation . They try to learn through trial and error rather than by seeking counsel . Their speculative structure begins to crumble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder for them to meet their debts ? and the structure falls completely apart .  | THE DEBACLE OF DISENCHANTMENT The stresses that victimize suburbanites on the way up fall into three main groups : First : the sensitizers , intensely upsetting experiences that make a man or woman more than normally thin-skinned emotionally . They often occur in childhood , but may occur at any time in life . Loss of a husband or a wife , loss of a job , prolonged illness any such experience might act to thin the emotional defenses . Second : the pressurizers , the continuous or repeated stresses of life ? stresses that are particularly numerous in modern suburbia . In Alice Hager 's some of the pressurizers were drudgery without reward , lack of friendship and stimulation , lack of understanding and companionship from Carl , responsibilities of managing home and children in a competitive community without help or guidance . All of these , gnawing at her constantly , kept Alice tense , unhappy and afraid . They kept her in an emotionally unstable condition that any shock might upset . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of as the final shock or series of shocks that brings on an emotional collapse . In Alice 's case some of the main precipitators were Carl 's angry criticisms , her son 's hitting her , and her mother 's sudden death . The three-part categorizing of stresses is particularly useful in studying emotional problems of pregnancy , childbirth , and new motherhood . Women who have been subjected to a large number of stresses may break down emotionally under the heavy new stress of childbearing . The experience becomes a precipitator . Emotional breakdowns in childbearing occur vastly more often in today 's suburbs than in the more stable and older communities . Among 746 psychiatric patients iu Bergen County ? men and women , all ages ? fully nine percent were young wives with maternity problems . In a comparable group of people visiting a rural psychiatric clinic , only two percent were maternity cases . Childbearing , usually thought of as a gloriously satisfying experience for a woman , is not felt to be so by increasing numbers of mothers ? a sad fact of our new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study . ' BABY BLUES IN INDIGO . The case of Gina and John Conning is a study of the " baby blues " in deep indigo . It shows how such a disturbance develops , and where it may lead . Gina and John came into Bergen County during the mid-1950 's , full of hope for a bright future . Two months after her first baby was born , in the small dark hours of a snowy morning , Gina appeared at the local police station in a state of acute terror . She was hatless . wearing bedroom slippers , shivering violently . All the police could understand from what she said was that she was being influenced from afar by some mysterious , sinister agency that wanted her to perform sexual perversions and stab her husband and two-month-old baby girl . Sobbing , she begged to be locked up . What had happened to Gina ? How had she come to a state that both the police and her husband feared was lunacy ? Gina 's story began in New York City , where she was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Taken care of by her older sister , Gloria , Gina ripened into an intelligent , extraordinarily attractive girl with many friends of both sexes . Things were fine until Gloria , under the stress of earning a living and caring for Gina , began to have violent outbursts of temper . It was not unusual for her to throw things , strike Gina , even brandish a knife . Occasionally , too , she had emotional problems over the men she dated . She would come weeping to Gina , confide that she had slept with a man and sob that she was sinful and worthless . Finally , Gina , after going to work as a stenographer and taking courses in art and advertising copywriting , met and married John Conning , a young accountant who had dreams of modernizing and expanding his father 's small sheetmetal business . Gina admired John 's dream . She , too , had a dream , and she saw in John an opportunity to realize it . Her dream was to break away from the old , warm , too-comfortable city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brighter ? though perhaps colder ? world . Soon ' she found herself desperately coping with that bigger , brighter world she sought . To begin with , John 's mother was indignant because Gina often went alone to the city to visit friends and see art shows when John was working late . A wife 's place was with her husband , John 's mother believed . Also , she did not like the way Gina dressed . She thought women should dress modestly , but Gina dressed to please John and to show off her considerable physical charms . At John 's urging , however , Gina finally consented ? to keep the family peace ? to wear clothes that , to her , were unattractive and dowdy . She did not feel like herself in them . Anger seethed inside her ; other people were trying to change her personality . GUILT ? AND ITS BEGINNING . While this tension was building up in Gina , another kind of trouble began to develop . The use of artificial birth-control devices , forbidden by her religion but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she often was not able to respond to him as affectionately as she wanted to . Partly because of this , and partly because John was so often exhausted from his work at the plant , sexual relations between them became less and less frequent . Thinking his mother was turning him against her , Gina was hurt and angry . Despite John 's precautions , Gina became pregnant three years after their marriage . The  | apartment was too small for a child , and both John and Gina were anxious to improve their physical comforts and social status . They decided to buy a house . Blaming Gina , John 's parents thought the idea was foolishly extravagant ? especially since they themselves had lived in apartments for the first twenty years of their married life . John and Gina insisted on a house , but to pacify John 's parents they bought an old , inexpensive house in one of the county 's slowly declining old neighborhoods . It meant a long commuting trip for John , and he came home later , more tired than ever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a neighborhood of older people . Gina became dissatisfied with her new home even before her pregnancy was over . She became less and less able to visit her old friends and pur ; ue her literary and artistic interests in the city . In her new home community , she found , there were few outlets for these interests . The baby came , and Gina 's visits to the city stopped almost entirely . She was trapped at home with a strange , frightening small being whose demands kept her on the brink of exhaustion . There was no one to show her the ropes of motherhood . She had to learn the hard way , do it by herself ? unlike a young mother in an older community , who usually has her mother , sisters , cousins and aunts to help and advise her . And this advice is likely to be consistent . Families in older communities have rules that have proved workable over many years and can be observed with confidence . Gina was in a trap . Her life , once so vital and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care and household chores . She yearned to do something in which she could use her brain and her literary and artistic abilities . She desperately needed reassurance that she was doing a good job . She needed fun away from home , stimulation and challenge , occasional rewards . NO MEDALS FOR MAMA . But the mobile society rewards success in business , not in the home . The climbing husband , rough though his life is , has this very great consolation : he is patted on the back for a job well done . His wife gets little reward or recognition for her work in the home . Nobody hands out medals for successful child-raising . From the position of the housewife there are few , if any , promotions . Still more worry was added to Gina 's load when John 's father 's business ? which the older man refused to modernize ? began to have serious trouble . It seemed likely that John 's pay , never high , would have to be cut temporarily while the business tried to regain its strength . John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . One evening , weak with fatigue , Gina changed the baby 's diapers before putting her to bed . The baby was fretful ; she squirmed and cried shrilly . Anger boiled up in Gina , and suddenly she had an urge to stick the safety pin into the baby . The urge frightened her . Gina began to have nightmares in which she stabbed John or the baby . In one of the dreams her sister Gloria handed her a knife , and an unseen power forced Gina to throw it at John . Gina woke from these nightmares screaming in panic . She did not understand what was putting these ghastly notions in her head . She grew afraid to go to sleep , and this contributed to her worsening insomnia and the increasing frequency of her hallucinations . It was a terrifying situation . Gina had heard that wifehood and motherhood was a delightful , fulfilling experience . She was finding it to be something entirely different : a trap , a weary labor , a monumental disappointment . She had heard that a mother instinctively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not always love hers ? POSTPARTUM PROBLEMS . When Gina 's baby was about six weeks old , something happened that further complicated Gina 's problems . She visited her obstetrician for a postpartum physical examination . During the course of the examination , Gina suddenly found herself aroused , in the grip of wild sexual excitement . That this should have happened was understandable . Gina 's sexual relationship with her husband had been unsatisfactory for a long time , and ever since the seventh month of pregnancy , Gina and John had abstained from intercourse entirely ; thus Gina was in need of sexual gratification . In addition , glandular changes had taken place during pregnancy and lactation which in her , as in many women , increased sexual desires . She was in a condition in which any small reminder , such as the physical examination , could raise her desires to a high pitch . The problem was intensified by the fact that she lived in a modern mobile society that has made women more knowledgeable about sex . In the old-time American communities there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was possible for them to enjoy sexual experience ? they saw intercourse simply as a duty to their husbands . Knowing that it is possible for her to achieve sexual enjoyment , the modern wife may fret more when deprived of sexual satisfaction than did the wife of 50 years ago . Not understanding all of this , Gina thought the doctor might have aroused her on purpose , perhaps as part of some obscure postpartum treatment . It seemed to her that ? like John 's parents ? the doctor was trying to control her . During the following weeks , Gina made wild demands on John . She had never felt so aroused sexually before . She wanted to experiment with new techniques and positions she had heard and read about , some of which were unusual and most of which she had been taught to think of as perversions . John was horrified and frightened . He had  | been brought up in a cultural group that , considerably more than Gina 's , frowned on free expression of emotions and desires . He recoiled from Gina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreat increased Gina 's anger and her sexual frustration . She began to masturbate for the first time in her life . She was filled with feelings of immense guilt . It was wrong for a woman 's thoughts to dwell so much on unusual sex acts . Why could n't she put them out of her mind ? Why was the doctor doing this to her ? Gradually Gina 's angry thoughts centered as knives , a natural result of her having seen knives brandished in her sister 's hand . Gina grew terrified that , one day , she would kill John or the baby with a knife . One day when the baby was fretful and Gina was exhausted from housecleaning for an impending visit by her parents-in-law , she became so frightened that she gathered all the knives in the house and threw them into the trash can . That night Gina lay tossing in bed until long past midnight . John was in the guest room . Her mind skittered restlessly from one problem to another . Her legs and back ached with fatigue . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then the baby began to cry . Gina 's anger welled up intolerably . For a while , Gina stood over the baby 's crib , holding her head in her hands . She was going to kill the baby ; she was certain of it . She ran downstairs , threw on a coat , and fled to the police . Like Alice Hager , Gina eventually struggled back to a normal , happy life , as we shall see later . But nothing had happened to Gina ? or to Alice ? that could not have been prevented . ACCUMULATION OF STRESSES . The case of Gina and John Conning illustrates a key fact about emotional disturbance . It shows that emotional stresses are cumulative . When the sum of the stresses becomes too great to bear , the individual collapses . Stresses fall into two categories : active and passive . An active stress is an unpleasant circumstance acting directly on the individual , such as the exhausting and confusing demands of her baby on Gina . A passive stress is a lack of reward or pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistic interests and her friends . Both kinds of stress weighed heavily on Gina , as on many young women in suburbia . This mathematical approach to emotional problems was demonstrated between 1957 and 1959 with groups of expectant mothers in a Bergen County hospital . The findings about these women probably can be assumed to apply to all other groups ? men and women , married and single , young and old ? and to other stressing life events , such as going away to college , entering military service , divorce , retirement . In the case of the expectant mothers , it turned out that 15 categories , or stress factors , were significant . Each of these factors showed up often in lives of mothers who became disturbed during the maternity experience ; normal mothers , who came through birth and new motherhood happily , were much less likely to have experienced them . These stress factors included such circumstances as the wife 's mother 's having died before her daughter was twenty-one ; the husband 's father 's having died ; the wife 's having been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the husband 's having risen above his father 's occupation and income ; the husband 's and wife 's having achieved a higher educational level than their parents had ; a failure to complete her education by the wife ; the husband 's often working late at night ; the wife 's lack of experience with babies ; the fact that the baby was a first one ; and physical complications in the pregnancy . Studies of the young mothers showed that the more stresses , the greater the likelihood of emotional trouble . For example , there were many stress factors in Gina 's case . Her mother had died before Gina was twenty-one . Gina had had no previous experience with babies . John 's occupation was higher in status than Gina 's father 's had been ( indicating that Gina was mobile ) . Her education was higher than her parents ' ( again , mobility ) . John 's education was higher than his parents ' ( which led to a clash of views on business policies ) .

MARRIAGE ON THE ROCKS There is little doubt that the wear and tear of modern suburban living can badly fray , if not actually break , the marriage ties . While statistics on broken marriages do not always tell an accurate story ? changing social and legal attitudes toward divorce may affect the figures , for example , and people have more money than they used to have to sue for divorce ? statistics show that in mobile Bergen County between 1950 and 1956 the number of divorces increased 26 percent and the number of separations increased 100 percent . In nearby Essex , a more stable county , the number of divorces decreased 17 percent and the number of separations decreased 2 percent . Why is it that a mobile society can have this effect on marriage ? One of the big reasons is what might be called the " suburban schism . " This refers to the fact that the husband and wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually amounts to separate lives . The man goes to work ; the woman stays home . They live in different worlds . Neither may know much about the other 's daily affairs . They may lose , if they had ever developed , the habit of talking to one  | another . Thus , subjected to different influences , a man and woman who were once matched neatmay change until they are very badly mismatched . The beginning of the end of many a marriage comes when one partner or the other , abandoning the effort to find solutions to problems at home , begins seeking the things he or she needs ? love , praise , usefulness , sexual or intellectual stimulation ? through extramarital relationships . Once this happens , the hope of straightening out the marriage dims markedly . The story of Link and Diane Weber illus. trates some of these problems of marriage in " disturbia . " In particular , it illustrates the problem of a man 's growing while his wife stands still , and of a double standard in attitudes toward sex . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bergen County , were easygoing , comfortable , fifth-generation Americans of the mid-middle class . Her childhood was happy and uneventful . She grew up as an American type in many respects : the girl next door ? cheerful , serene , pleasant , and confident that one day a nice young man would come along and take care of her as her parents always had . On the other hand , R. Lincoln Weber came up from immigrant laboring-class origins , having to fight for everything he got , working his way through law school , willingly enduring the physical hardships of insufficient food and sleep in order to get his law degree . He was brilliant , witty , nervously energetic . He was attracted to Diane partly because of her higher social status . During his courtship of Diane , Link antagonized her parents by refusing to show any respect for them ; and , among other things , scorning the Sunday visiting that was traditional in the family . Diane 's parents were also concerned over the fact that Link was twenty-eight , Diane only nineteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Link . Her reason for an early marriage was that she was " in love " with Link . Just out of high school , Diane had not known many men well . She had no one with whom to compare Link to judge the likelihood of his making her happy for the rest of her life . Her parents had not taught her much about sex and marriage . If Diane had experienced sexual attraction to other men , if she had learned what the emotion is like and how it may be controlled , it would not have been as likely to overwhelm her when Link was on the scene . As it happened , she failed to think clearly and carefully about the marriage . Her parents grudgingly accepted her marriage to Link , fearing she might already have begun an affair . In the early , happy days of their marriage , during which they lived in an apartment in New York , Diane worked as a filing clerk to put Link through his last two years of law school . Within a short time after his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success of his own law firm . Children arrived , and the couple moved to a house in the suburbs . Occasionally Diane missed the bright life of the city , felt twinges of envy at the enormous fun Link was obviously reaping from his work . Yet she was content . She was fulfilling her role as a woman : she had a husband who provided for her and often said he loved her , and one day , when the children were grown , she would see more of Link and of the outside world . THE OTHER MAN . Actually , Diane was not totally deprived of social life . There were many young families in the neighborhood , and there were frequent weekend parties , barbecues , occasionally a block dance . When Link was working , Diane sometimes went to the gatherings by herself , sharing the expense of a baby-sitter with a neighbor . At one of the parties Diane met Jack , a young divorced executive , who took a strong interest in her . On various occasions , she managed to rebuff his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the worse . Diane and Link , attending one of their infrequent parties together , had had a spat ; Diane , after several cocktails , had spitefully begun to dance with Jack . Within minutes , to her own bewilderment , she found herself becoming sexually excited . Diane 's sudden response to Jack , coming mainly because her sexual enjoyment with her husband had long since begun to dull , caused her to feel extremely guilty . Because of the differences in the sexual attitudes between men and women a husband who finds himself aroused by a woman other than his wife may feel annoyed , amused , temporarily frustrated . A wife in the same situation may react with vastly more painful emotions . Believing that sex is an expression of love rather than of mere pleasure , this arousal goes against all that she has been taught . It is wrong , evil . Diane , when the time for the traditional midnight kiss came , broke away from Jack , ran wildly to her husband , and begged him to take her home . NO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's overobvious show of fondness for the divorced young executive , was in no mood to make love to her that night . Thus she lay in the dark , frustrated and swamped by guilt . She did not understand the social and psychological causes of her predicament . She knew only that desires had been aroused in her by a man who was not her husband , and that this was wrong . She felt that she desired the man , Jack , not merely the sexual act . She was sure that her husband must know . He was punishing her . From that day on , Diane avoided social gatherings , fearing to meet the man who had aroused her . She avoided even talking with  | other men . She attended daytime gatherings of women , shielding herself with comforting woman talk : babies , shopping , measles . Link had found a whole new way of life in New York City . He had met challenging men and exciting women ; and when a wealthy , troubled divorcee indicated her willingness to share her life with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . His announcement that he wanted a separation stunned Diane . What followed left her utterly helpless . As a lawyer , Link knew exactly how to accomplish the separation with minimum inconvenience to himself . In her ignorance , Diane signed a separation agreement which bound Link to do only one thing : . pay fifteen dollars a week for her and each of the two children . Link took the bank accounts and sold the house ? giving her only one-third of the net receipts . Diane took her children back to her parents ' home . She was deeply depressed , tormented by a feeling that the break-up was somehow her own fault . She had n't been bright enough for Link ; she had n't stimulated him enough intellectually , emotionally or physically ; she had been unfaithful to him . She felt that she was a failure as a woman . Shattered and hopeless , Diane shrank into her mother 's home to live with guilt and loneliness . Thus a perfectly normal girl , a girl with no childhood traumatization , was left with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life in the changeful mobile world . THE TYRANNY OF THE CHILDREN Among the reasons that bring a typical climber family to the suburbs , children rank high . It has been said that American culture is childcentered . If this is true , it is hardly more noticeable anywhere than in the suburbs . Nothing seems too good for the youngsters . Problems of child psychology are discussed at every party and back-fence gathering . " I 'm fed up with commuting , " you can hear men growl on the buses and trains . " If it were n't for the kids ... " It is sad to discover in the light of all this that our mobile suburbs are still far from being a kids ' paradise . There are many bright , happy children , but there are also more unhappy children than there should be . more delinquents , more who are failing in school , more who are having difficulties in their sexual and their social life . Bergen County 's high delinquency rates 40 boys per one thousand , five girls per one thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarming is the high ratio of boys to girls : eight to one , compared with four to one in the rural county we studied . This is as high as in some of the roughest city slum areas . ABSENTEE FATHERS . Something , particularly , is troubling the boys . One of their major problems , perhaps the most important , is a lack of good , solid guidance from their fathers . Just as a girl needs a mother on whom to model herself , a boy needs his father to serve as his model in ' growing up . In the mobile society he has many lessons to learn : the importance of education , how to study , how to assert himself without making enemies , how to persevere in tasks that may be hard and unpleasant , how to act considerately yet competitively toward others , how to control and direct anger and fear in himself and cope with these emotions in others . These and other things must be learned , and a boy learns them best from his father . His mother may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually as well as a man can . She has difficulty in teaching masculine selfassertiveness , for example , as well as many of the small aspects of masculine attitude and mannerism that will help a boy win his friends ' respect . Usually she can not teach him how to throw a baseball or handle a saw , nor does she usually fully understand the masculine attitude toward sex . Many boys of mobile suburban families lack the close fatherly guidance they need . The father leaves home after breakfast and does n't come back until just before the evening meal . The importance of firm fatherly guidance in a boy 's life can be shown in numbers . In Bergen County 's population at large , 11.5 percent of homes have no father present . Among girl psychiatric patients in one sampling , the proportion with no father in the home was 10 percent ? roughly the same as in the general population , indicating that an absentee father is not usually as much a problem to a girl . But among boy psychiatric patients , 17 percent were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were fatherless . THE " GIM ME " KIDS . Too many of the problems of mobile youngsters , both boys and girls , spring at least partly from the fact that the disturbia society is too giving to them . The feeling is in the air that children and teen-agers should be fed a steady diet of love ? by which is often meant coddling , protection from what is rough and unpleasant , showering with material treats . Many mobile parents have a notion that it may harm children 's personalities in some way to say no to them , to frustrate them , to repress their urges , or to spank them . This excess of giving springs from many causes . One is prosperity itself . In an age when the fruit of success seems waiting to be plucked from trees , the old middle-class virtues of hard work , thrift , and patience ? virtues which helped people get ahead in a less bountiful era ? no longer seem so important . Many parents , even those of solid middle-class descent , fail to teach these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " giving " attitude and the lack of masculine firmness is that the  | suburbs are full of obedient parents and spoiled , lazy , materialistic children . No one has cracked down on the youngsters . They take what they want because their parents have not insisted that they earn it . They are not used to hard work , nor are they willing to try it . They have not been made to feel a sense of responsibility . They are inconsiderate of others because they have not been made to consider anything but their own desires . They 're " gim me " kids . It is the gim me kids who most often become school-behavior problems or delinquents in the suburbs . It has become fashionable to refer to such uncontrolled youngsters as having deep psychological problems . Lack of love is blamed , perhaps , or too much violence on TV , or too much pornography . Usually all that is wrong is that the kid is spoiled . Even parents who try to bring up their children with more firmness may have difficulty . Disturbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbor 's spoiled youngster for rudeness may later get an angry call from the neighbor . A boy or girl who wants to do well in school may find it hard because his friends do not admire hard-working students . Girls are luckier than boys . They have their mothers as models . Though a mother may be tired , tense , or angry , she is at least there in the home . She can teach , by example , many of the things girls need to know . For both boys and girls another common problem in the mobile suburbs is that of the youngster who has been moved from one school to another as his or her parents climbed . Each time he has made friends ; each time he has been pulled away from them . If he is an unassertive youngster who finds friend-making difficult , he may have severe emotional trouble on the second or third move ? sometimes even on the first . He arrives at the new school and finds friendship cliques already formed . Like adult clubs , they may be inhospitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , may react to this situation by getting into sex trouble , as she tries to use sex as a lever for gaining entree into a clique . Or the newcomer may simply abandon the effort to make friends . He or she may retire home , perhaps to withdraw into the world of books . Either way , the youngster 's schoolwork is likely to suffer ; and the falling grades may add further to the emotional turmoil . The cycle becomes self-feeding . Occasionally , teen-agers caught in this kind of trap will make halfhearted , but sometimes successful , attempts at suicide . Thus , all these factors ? the lack of masculine controls , the " giving " attitude , and the constant moving ? can contribute to the development of what might be called the suburban delinquent . Unlike the typical city delinquent , the delinquent from the mobile suburban society has all the food he can eat , all the physical comforts he can ask for . He may have his own car and more spending money than he knows what to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance at a bright career if he would think about his future and apply himself . Life has been handed to him like a gift . Yet he is unhappy and frustrated , and has few friends . Such was the case with young Alec Green . Alec 's father , Burt , was an accountant ? badly overworked , tense , tired , and irritable . Severe headaches tormented him ; acute indigestion made him unpleasant company at many meals . He spoke gruffly or not at all to his wife , Alec 's mother , and sometimes , when his head hurt and his business worries bothered him more than usual , he barked at her rudely . Like most small boys , Alec wanted to do what his father did . He wanted to learn how to saw wood , drill holes , paint , spread cement , light the barbecue fire . His father had been his hero ; he wanted to be close to him , help him , learn from him , win his admiration . But Burt , busy even on weekends , pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still , he imitated the only side of his father he saw ? Burt 's discourteous , rather domineering ways . In time Alec became a caricature of his father . Too , Alec was a gim me kid . He got everything he wanted , and more , without being asked ? or , perhaps , allowed ? to work for it . As a result Alec was not learning that to achieve success you must produce . He had been rewarded with toys for shouting , screaming , and stamping his foot . From Alec 's point of view , the worse you acted and the less you did , the more you got . As a result of his childhood background , Alec took into his teens the attitude that the world owed him a living . He was ripe for trouble , and it was not long in coming . First he stole money from his mother 's purse and lied to her when she asked him about it . She did n't press the matter . It was easy , as Alec saw it . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FIRE-LIGHTING FLING . When he was about fourteen , Alec became involved in a far more serious incident ? an adventure with fire . Fire has a powerful fascination for many people , and boys seem more fascinated than most . Alec 's father had never had the time or the patience to teach Alec about fire and to let him experiment with it under supervision . As he grew up , Alec and his friends played with fire a number of times , lighting small bonfires in the town park or in someone 's garage . Then one night , trying to scare the girls at a neighborhood slumber party , Alec and his friends lit a small fire on the concrete floor of the basement of the house in which the girls were staying . Within seconds the fire was blazing to the ceiling , out of control . Hysterical with fright , Alec bolted for the window and fled . Fortunately , the owner of the house was able to put out the blaze with a fire-extinguisher unit ; although he had recognized Alec and his  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antagonizing Alec 's parents . Having got by once again without having had to account for his actions , Alec continued to behave as the whim seized him . The police picked him up joy-riding with friends in a neighbor 's car , which the boys had " borrowed " without permission . But this neighbor did n't press charges either . When Alec 's mother heard of the incident she sighed sadly . His father was too tired to do more than merely shout at him for a few minutes . Alec learned , once more , that he could get away with almost anything . THE WOLF PACK . Now came the crucial incident that almost ruined young Alec Green 's life . Alec and his friends in the wolf pack bragged to each other a lot about their conquest of girls . Few , in truth , had made such conquests . Alec himself had petted to a climax a few times but had never had complete intercourse , and , in fact , did n't quite know how the act would be accomplished : his father had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many mobile suburban families , there just was n't enough time for the long , leisurely , probing talk by which people can settle perplexing problems . Still shy as individuals , Alec and his gang were hold as a group when it came to sex . They called up girls from phone booths and made obscene remarks , picked up girls in bowling alleys and at the movies . One night Alec and two of his friends went to the home of a more or less willing fifteen-yearold girl to carry sex , on a group basis , to its ultimate degree . It was Alec 's first attempt at complete sexual intercourse . Worried that he would do something wrong , afraid to ask advice , tense and frightened , he botched his chance ludicrously . The experience left him frustrated and miserable , full of new doubts about his sexual capacities . The party was still in progress when the girl 's parents unexpectedly came home . Hearing them open the door , the girl moved quickly to protect her reputation and escape blame . She screamed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court . Reporters writing of the case and other people discussing it pictured Alec and his friends as , variously , hard-boiled young toughs or deeply disturbed boys who should be handled with love and pity . These boys were , in fact , neither . They were simply soft , spoiled , undisciplined gim me kids ? victims of a combination of circumstances which are only too prevalent in mobile suburban society . Alec 's young life , as we shall see , was not yet beyond all hope of salvage ; but there was little question that it had been badly battered . NINE PROVED WAYS TO MAKE YOUR LIFE EASIER AND HAPPIER As the preceding stories of unhappy people have shown , stresses are cumulative . It is not simply the nature of stresses but also the weight and shock of them that determine whether a man or woman will give way emotionally . The case studies have showed , further , that our mobile society has bred a tenser kind of life than that which Americans knew when our society was more stable . Statistically , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stresses that add up to emotional disturbance . Now these questions arise : Is it possible to lighten the burden of stresses an individual carries or help him carry them more easily ( which is effectively the same thing ) ? Can some emotional troubles be prevented ? Even better can people reduce stresses by themselves ? The answer to all these questions is , demonstrably , yes . DO-IT-YOURSELF THERAPY . To cope with the ongoing , practical stresses of the mobile world , a new realm of medical and behavioral science has been developed : social psychiatry . It deals with the individual 's social environment rather than directly with his inner feelings . 0f value to both troubled and normal individuals in this mobile age , this approach concentrates on unloading stresses rather than on probing for their causes , on practical problems of the present rather than on those from the past . Between 1953 and 1959 , a series of comparisons was made in Bergen County of deep-probing , or uncovering , therapy and of social therapy . In general , the latter technique was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the less mobile . Among childbearing women who had lived in Bergen County five years or longer ( a crude index of nonmobility ) , the rate of success in social psychotherapy was 54 percent . Among newcomers ? the more mobile women who had been in the county less than five years ? the rate was nearly 100 percent . Social therapy is economical in that even severely troubled people can often be treated in relatively few psychiatric sessions . An even greater advantage of social psychiatry , however , is that its principles can be understood and applied by the layman . The techniques of social psychotherapy which have worked effectively with Bergen 's mobile people can be applied by all individuals in all the suburbs of America . These techniques , in effect , might be considered as rules for happy , adjusted , successful living . Once taught these techniques by a psychiatrist who had identified their problems for them ? but not cured them ? the patients and their families , friends , and associates chose the combinations of techniques  | that were practicable in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . Here are the nine techniques of social psychotherapy that worked so well in helping the people in our case histories solve the problems they faced while living in modern mobile suburbs . TECHNIQUE NUMBER 1 : HELP AND UNDERSTANDING . One of the most striking attributes of mobile Americans is their dogged independence of spirit . Yet this very spirit works against them , because when a stressful situation comes along , they try to go it alone rather than seek help from others . In this same vein , mobile people are also slow to realize that others need their help . Life in the older , more stable communities was carried on in a permanent environment of mutual help , and mobile people can prevent emotional trouble by creating a similar environment for themselves . Carl Hager , for example , who found his gentle Southern wife , Alice , huddled in a closet , learned that he would have to make some changes in his attitudes if his wife were to recover from her emotional collapse . He slowly withdrew slightly from his preoccupation with getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His attitude toward Alice changed gradually from irritability at her ineffectiveness to sympathetic understanding . Thanks to his praise , thoughtfulness and companionship , within a few weeks , with medical tranquilization . Alice 's panic had subsided . Fears are extinguished only by repeated exposure to the fear-inspiring situation with the danger removed or lessened , and often with a trusted escort to lean upon . When the troubled individual faces larger and larger dosed of the feared thing again and again without being hurt , the conditioned fear gradually fades . Carl eventually took Alice to the supermarket , showed her how to bargain good-humoredly with tradesmen , and gently but firmly handle other people she thought were trying to trample on her . When she became more ready to meet people , they both joined the local ParentTeacher Association . Thus , with Carl helping , Alice began to seek friends and pleasures in the community she had hated . No longer required to do battle alone , she gradually lost her feelings of persecution . Her hallucinations finally ceased . Carl soon stopped propping Alice up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of getting ahead and leave her all alone . He and she established a permanent environment of mutual help . Help such as Alice received from Carl ? help from family , neighbors , community , business associates ? can keep even severely disturbed people out of mental hospitals . In the years 1953-54 , a group of 243 troubled suburbanites were treated by psychiatric methods in which the family and friends were not usually called in for consultation or asked to help . Fifteen percent of the patients had to be hospitalized . In 1958-59 the social-psychiatric factor of help was added , combined with new tranquilizing and energizing drugs , for a new group of 325 patients . Only 3.7 percent ? one-fourth as many ? had to be sent to mental hospitals . Mutual help , mutual service : this is the first step by which a mobile community can begin to replace the emotional satisfaction of the oldtime integrated community . TECHNIQUE NUMBER 2 : PRODUCING FOR RECOGNITION . As in old-time American stable communities , our mobile society also rewards producers , but in the dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing " has become obscured . People in essence have tried to gain the rewards of productivity without first earning them through truly productive activity . They have tried to gain them through short cuts , through the " facade syndrome . " Eve Bright noted that many wealthy people were popular , looked up to . What she failed to understand was that it is not usually the wealth itself that wins friends and admirers , but the usefulness , the productiveness from which wealth may result . With counseling , Eve saw how futile all the spending had been . If she wanted real recognition , she realized , there were two things she could do . She could find ways to make herself useful to the people of the community by producing for them instead of trying to buy their admiration . And she could help Fred become more productive economically by helping him reduce his burden of worry , cutting the family 's spending , making the children do some of his home-maintenance chores to earn their rewards . In these ways recognition would eventually come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would come wealth . Fred , too , had begun to understand that there is no safe short cut to the rewards that glitter so brightly . The way to climb was to be increasingly productive ? to prepare to do more advanced work , and then to step up into the next higher job when qualified to perform it well . Fred 's first task was to learn his present job well . A realization of the necessity of productiveness also helped Alec Green , the gim me kid who was hauled before the juvenile court on the morals charge . He discovered at last that the world would n't let him have his own way all the time . The judge gave him an indeterminate sentence and put him on probation , with an evening curfew and an order to report weekly , with his parents , to a probation officer . If he did n't behave , the judge warned , he would go to a training school . Alec 's parents now began to recognize their responsibility in preparing Alec for successful living . Alec had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his behavior.  | Burt now reduced the allowance , but offered Alec an opportunity to earn a greater amount by mowing the lawn , weeding crab grass , and doing other jobs about the house . He told Alec that from then on he would have to produce before he consumed . Alec at first refused to work . But Burt was firm . After a few weeks of being broke , Alec slowly started to produce . Like the technique of mutual help with which it is linked , productiveness is a key to happiness in the mobile society . Producing is the surest way of getting ahead . The majority of people who are in the mid-middle and upper-middle classes today are there because they have produced something for which society has paid them well . They have been rewarded not only in material things , but also in having the best chances for happiness in the mobile world . TECHNIQUE NUMBER 3 : PLANNING AND PREPARATION . Life in the stable society was a good deal simpler than it is today . There was less need for broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future could be directed along a single , narrow path . Our society today is more complex . The mobile man and woman require a broad , continuous education , in and out of school . Fred Bright needed more training to do his job better and less painfully . He began to educate himself informally ; he asked questions , consulted more experienced men . He also sensed a need for more formal education , and he arranged a program of courses in a university . As his knowledge expanded , his self-confidence grew . He was able to handle his job more effectively , accomplishing the same amount of work in less time . He had confidence that he was now making himself too useful to the company to be fired . Also , Diane Weber learned to make use of planning and preparation . After her divorce from Link , the husband who had outgrown her , she regretted not having had a college education . Like many girls , she had built her entire future on her husband . She had no career skill other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , who stood by her and were willing to help with the children , she realized that she must begin now to make the preparations she should have made before marriage . She enrolled in a secretarial school . A mobile man 's or woman 's chances of happiness , in short , are directly proportional to the amount of knowledge he or she has . This can be demonstrated in numbers : the better educated are far more likely to do well in psychotherapy than those with less education . In one group of disturbed young married women . only 52 percent of those with less than high-school education responded well to treatment . But of those with high school or higher education , 77 percent did well . The technique of planning and preparation is linked with producing , which is linked with the environment of help . All have much to do with the fourth technique : diversity . TECHNIQUE NUMBER 4 : DIVERSITY . The mobile world is full of uncertainties . Real security can come only from flexibility and diversity ? from having more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income , recognition , reward . Thus , if there is failure in one area , the others will continue to provide support . Diane Weber is an example of someone who should have diversified even before marriage . She should not have been so vulnerable to the effects of Link 's sudden withdrawal from her life . She would also have been better off if she had been active in the community , if she had had many interests and many friends . Happily , organizations are developing spontaneously in the mobile world to fill some of the void that was created by the disruption of the old multigeneration family . Diane Weber joined one of these : Parents Without Partners , a national club of mothers and fathers who have lost spouses by separation , divorce , death . Diane also found a job after graduating from her secretarial course . At the Parents Without Partners meetings and in her new job , Diane slowly began to meet people , find new rewards , rebuild her shattered life . The shy Southerner , Alice Hager , meanwhile , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had only one area of life in which to seek rewards . That area had been her home , and she had found too few rewards there . She needed diversity . At first with her husband 's help and then more often alone , she explored the resources of the community , working for the good of others ? and as a result for her own good ? in local clubs and organizations . Diversification is an old technique of prudent stock-market investors . It has been developed on Wall Street as protection against the changefulness , the unpredictability , of the market . It serves equally well in the boom-and-bust of the mobile society . TECHNIQUE NUMBER 5 : CLIMBING WITH CARE . It is important to assess carefully the gains that may come from a promotion , a transfer or a change of employers . Mobile Americans have an optimistic attitude toward change . We tend to feel that unless the observable facts point the other way a change must be for the better . We welcome change for its own sake . A lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We change jobs , houses and spouses ? sometimes , it seems , just for the sake of change . True , change is frequently rewarding . But equally often , the same rewards can be gained with less fuss and stress by staying with the  | existing situation and improving it . A typical young couple like John and Gina Conning , ambushed by the older generation , might move to the other end of the country to get away from the old folks ' interference . But John and Gina u ere beginning to work things out by staying home . with benefit to them and to the elder Connings . Already Gina and her mother-in-law had formed a friendship in mutual service to the baby . They were giving each other something that neither might have had if the young couple had pulled up stakes . John and his father would also settle their business disagreement soon , by sticking with it and giving it thought . Change is not automatically for the best . The distant pasture , so green to the eye , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much change , too fast , may involve too much stress . TECHNIQUE NUMBER 6 : REST AND REWARD . It is not always enough merely to produce . It is essential to be rewarded . Friends , good times , a more interesting life , a feeling of accomplishment , an occasional pat on the back : to strive without these is to risk emotional disturbance . Rewards counterbalance stresses . A man or woman who is getting plenty of rewards from life can stand a good deal of stress . Parents who help their youngsters earn rewards both inside and outside the= home can demand more of them in school and at home . But a youngster who is pushed and disciplined without being rewarded may rebel or develop emotional problems . Rewards should also come fairly often . The promise of a single big treat at the end of the school term is seldom enough , for example , to pull a C average up to an A or to make a brat into a model of courtesy . Adult psychology is the same . Many mobile people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too little . The young husband dreams of the time when he will be an executive and own a big house ; the middle-aged man dreams of retirement in Florida . Wives , too , try to milk happiness from the thought that , one day in the dim future , their children will be in school and there will be freedom to relax and enjoy life . But stresses close in before the glorious day of reward arrives . The wise climber gives himself rewards at every step of the way . He does n't set his sights on a high , high peak and try to get there in one long , unbroken climb . He has daily plateaus : coffee breaks , sessions of play and exercise , leisurely meals that can be looked forward to with pleasure . There should also be weekly plateaus : family outings , parties , movies . And there should be other , bigger rewards . Everyone should take a yearly vacation , get away from home , see new places and faces . Mothers and fathers ? particularly mothers ? should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an occasional weekend or week . Rewards , like stresses , are individual . For the young Italian-American mother , Gina Conning , for example , art and literature were rewards . One of the reasons she had become upset was that she was deprived of her artistic and literary satisfactions because of maternity . As part of her rehabilitation , she enrolled in a local college . She attended one night class a week , studying art and literary composition while her husband and mother-in-law baby-sat . Life without frequent rewards is stressful and painful , no matter how brightly the distant goal may shine . Many mobile people fail to realize that the climb itself can be just as pleasant as the imagined joys of the golden plateau . TECHNIQUE NUMBER 7 : TACTFUL SELFASSERTION . It is sometimes possible to get the impression about the suburbs that everybody is out to get everybody else . Though the observation is often exaggerated , there is some truth in it . The modern mobile community is a rough , competitive world . People in this world must look out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underfoot . In the more stable community , the weak and the timid were more likely to be protected by a wall of friendship . Not only did they have more protection but they needed it less . They did not deal so often with strangers , but with people they knew well and had reason to trust . Mobile people can replace much of the lost protection through mutual help , diversity , and other techniques . But they must also learn to be self-assertive enough to increase their pleasures , protect themselves , and reduce unnecessary stresses . For example , Alice Hager , the shy Southerner , had to learn how to bargain with tradesmen and be firm with her sons when Carl could not be there to help her . On the other hand , it is important not to swing the other way and become pushily assertive . It is a self-protective , not an aggressive , assertiveness that most often proves useful to mobile people . Even the self-protective kind is most profitable when coupled with tact and courtesy -- when it is firmness rather than anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of avoiding stress in the mobile world than either the aggressive or the timid do . The successful mobile man looks out for himself without hurting anyone . TECHNIQUE NUMBER 8 : A REASSESSMENT OF VALUES . One of the things that made the integrated , stable community a comfortable place in which to live was the existence of a single , clear set of standards , rules , and values . Our mobile society so far has not developed for itself such a unified set of standards , rules , and values . People are improvising , living by all kinds of standards , some of which conflict with present reality and with each other .  | Many of the tentative new values that the mobile society has so far developed will also have to be re-examined . Some have already proved less than useful : Eve Bright 's facade of affluence , Alice Hager 's pseudo independence , Fred Bright 's speculative living . As we continue work toward a more useful value system , the important factor will be a willingness to think objectively , to stand back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider which are still useful in the realities of today . TECHNIQUE NUMBER 9 : EMOTIONAL CONTROL . A feeling has grown up among some mobile people that it is necessary and healthy to emote all over the place . They shout at each other and at their children in public . They make passionate love in other people 's living rooms . When a responsibility annoys them they abandon it , as Link Weber did . On the other hand , there are people who practice too much control . Fred Bright was one . He was right in seeing that to complain of your troubles is no way to win praise and respect . But Fred carried his stoicism too far . He failed to consult a doctor early about his stomach pains or to stop and think of ways he might ease his tensions . Neither extreme produces useful results . Properly controlled , emotions help us get ahead safely and happily . Achievement of emotional control is maturity . Patience is one form of emotional control . Mobile adults who have been trained to ' be patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be able to live through longer periods of scarce rewards without getting as upset as Alice Hager and Gina Conning did . They will not be so eager to reach for high-salary jobs , as Fred Bright did , without adequate preparation . Perseverance is allied with patience . It is the ability to keep trying , to keep working at tasks that may not be pleasant , in order to earn rewards . The mobile adult who has learned perseverance is likely to be a producer . He has the habit of working for what he wants . Instead of abandoning his marriage when it does n't go exactly right , he sticks with it , working for improvement . Courage is another form of control . It is an ingrained habit of blocking the emotional impulse to run and hide , facing fears and working to remove their causes . Like other kinds of control , it must be learned . In the older , more stable society , women had less need than men to control fear . Men in those days protected women from dangers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Women and girls must become tougher and braver . Patience , perseverance and courage are only a few examples of emotional control . All require step-by-step training . The man or woman who did n't learn control as a child can not now be expected to learn it by tomorrow afternoon . Many will need help . Alice needed her husband to help her overcome a fear that had paralyzed her . With practice , emotional control grew steadily easier for her . Practice makes skills such as patience more habitual , so that less reward is needed for greater actual performance . With experience in emotional control comes the important element of detachment : the ability to stand back and watch one 's own emotions at work . This leads to understanding of the emotions and ability to make them serve . THOUGHT-SHUNTING . This kind of emotional control is further aided by a conscious effort to direct and control thinking ? a technique that might be called thought-shunting . Fred Bright used it to calm his tensions during - aggravating office situations . Despite the fact that he had reorganized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his boss or anyone else , he still had an emotional fear of his boss . To help speed up the extinguishing process of this fear reaction , he learned to think of all the reasons why his boss could n't hurt him and of all the pleasant things there were in his life . POSSIBILITIES OF PREVENTION . Beyond being effective in alleviating stress , can the nine techniques also be used to prevent emotional difficulties ? Are they as useful in preserving serenity as in recapturing it after it is lost ? To find out , a three-year study was conducted in Bergen County . Once again , for the sake of scientific convenience , the subjects were expectant mothers . The results ? The mothers who had received instructions in applying the nine techniques of social psychiatry not only had substantially fewer emotional troubles resulting from pregnancy but were much more successful in caring for their babies . The mothers and their husbands had in effect become their own psychiatrists . By making a few uncomplicated changes in their lives , many of them had saved themselves grief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be answered : How permanent was the effect of the nine techniques ? An indication came from a follow-up study of half the mothers , when their babies were about six months old . Among control mothers , 28 percent had problems at the half-year mark . Among the instructed mothers : two percent . It may be , indeed , that learning and successfully applying the nine techniques creates permanent changes in the personality . For example , as a young mother practiced using techniques of adjustment , they might become more and more habitual : she might weave them into her general approach to all life 's situations . But one important thing seems clear from the foregoing case histories and the many others we have studied : life in disturbia need not be nearly so stressful as it has been .
