The recent withdrawal of City Council President Ed Carey opens the way for a direct contest between black Wayne County Auditor Richard H.

" ED One of the most stubborn struggles in the Wisconsin Legislature involves the state 's freight truckers . The truckers are pushing for a law to permit the use of " double-bottomed " or tandem trailers of up to 65 feet in length .
