In the rosy afterglow of Jack Kennedy 's 400,000-vote landslide in New York , the state 's bread-and-butter Democratic bosses confidently presumed that they would get their just desserts . But by last week it was clear that they were getting the back of Kennedy 's hand . His victory , Kennedy figured , underscored New York 's latent Democratic strength , emphasized the party 's weakness in failing to win recent statewide elections . And the Kennedy forces have a vital stake in repairing that weakness : they want to cut Governor Nelson Rockefeller down to size when he comes up for re-election in 1962 . <P> " If we can do this , " said one top New York Kennedy man , " we will weaken Rockefeller 's presidential chances in ' 64 . " But if the party is torn asunder for two or three more years , we might very well lose the state-and the election-in ' 64 . ' ' <P> Promised Purge . New York 's Democratic Party has been torn asunder since the state convention of 1958 . Principal ripper was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall sachem who outraged most fellow Democrats and voters by dictating the selection of the party 's candidate for the U.S. Senate race , New York County District Attorney Frank Hogan . After Hogan and other Democrats were clobbered , bands of anti-De Sapio reformers in New York City clustered around aging Eleanor Roosevelt , former Governor Herbert Lehman , and former Air Force Secretary Thomas Fin-letter ( who had been done out of the senatorial nomination by De Sapio ) . They came within an ace of defeating De Sapio for the leadership of his home district in Greenwich Village , and they upended several De Sapio candidates in last year 's primaries . They had Jack Kennedy 's ear from the start , because Kennedy sorely wanted ( and ultimately got ) Stevenson-minded Eleanor Roosevelt 's endorsement . <P> Within weeks after the election , word went out from the Kennedys that De Sapio &; Co. must go . To take the teeth out of the Tammany tiger , the Kennedys cut off De Sapio 's federal patronage . Run-of-the-mill jobs are now being dispensed through Congressman Eugene Keogh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while applicants for higher jobs must call upon Bobby Kennedy or Brother-in-Law Sargent Shriver . The Washington tactics produced the desired results . New York 's Mayor Robert Wagner pushed Old Friend De Sapio to arm 's length , last week huddled with Reformer Lehman , gave word that he would strive to purge De Sapio . <P> The reformers ' timetable goes like this : <P> Bounce fumbling State Chairman Michael Prendergast , replace him and De Sapio with men acceptable to the reformers . ( Prendergast had incurred Kennedy 's fury during the campaign by publicly snubbing Lehman and Mrs. Roosevelt as they sat on a platform with Kennedy at a massive rally . Recalls a Kennedy aide : " Jack apologized to them on the spot . Unfortunately , Mrs. Roosevelt 's hearing aid was turned off at the time . But Lehman explained to her later . " ) <P> Pick a tough , independent deputy mayor who would scour up the 20-odd headlined scandals that have tarnished Wagner 's purchasing department , police department , etc . Already approached for the job : able City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
