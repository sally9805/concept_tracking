THE LITTLE DISTURBANCES OF MAN by Grace Paley. 189 pages . Viking . $4.50 . <P> In this fast and fickle culture , British Critic Cyril Connolly once declared , it is ambition enough for any author to set out to write a book that will last ten years . " And of how many books , " he asked , " is that true today ? " One notable example is this artful , bracing group of stories , Grace Paley 's first and , so far , only book . Little noticed when it was published in 1959 , it has since won enough readers and impressed enough critics to justify a new edition even before its first decade is up . <P> The source of the book 's vitality is its language-supple and colloquial , yet framed in the syntax of surprise . The syncopated speech patterns constantly shift away from familiar formulations . In An Interest in Life , a deserted mother observes : a woman " gets fatter , she gets older , she could lie down , nuzzling a regiment of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pleasure . But men are different , they have to own money , men must do well in the world . I know that men are not fooled by being happy . " <P> This language is the medium through which Grace Paley builds personality . It provides a salty , descriptive surface for otherwise callow characters such as the novice nymphet in bed with a soldier in A Woman , Young and Old , or the gay but rusting blade of The Contest who thinks he can do without marriage . For the book 's best and most typical characters-spunky , passionate women , abandoned by men and saddled with children and poverty-life is a form of coping with the mysteries of love and loneliness . <P> No catastrophes befall these people . Their trials are in what one character calls the " courts of kitchen drama , " where sadness and hilarity contend in a constant , shaky equilibrium . The teenage scientist of In Time Which Made a Monkey of Us All prankishly pipes non-toxic gas into neighborhood apartments , only to kill off all the animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trials can end with severe sentences . The deserted mother 's vision of her husband 's eventual return is affecting because it seems so hopeless . The teenager , unable to face the consequences of his experiment , goes mad and leaves his father to die of old age and grief . <P> This acknowledgment that the little disturbances of man are not so little is what saves the book from cleverness-this , and a warm acceptance of life . As one of its hard-pressed women observes when an inventory of all her troubles paradoxically gives her hope : " All that is really necessary for survival of the fittest , it seems , is an interest in life , good , bad , or peculiar . "
