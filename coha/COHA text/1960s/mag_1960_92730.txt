Robert Marvin Hull , the hard-hitting fancy skater who animates this week 's cover , may turn out to be one of the world 's great hockey players . If so , he will certainly be the only one who ascended to greatness by climbing all 1,812 steps of the Eiffel Tower as a goggle-eyed tourist in Paris . But that story comes later . The immediately significant fact is that the bright young star of the Chicago Black Hawks looms about as high above run-of-the-ice hockey players as the Eiffel Tower above the skyline of Paris . // During the last three seasons , Bobby Hull 's slashing skill on the ice in the service of the Hawks has brought light and hope to a team that , over the years , has dwelt in a state of almost unrelieved darkness and despair . A mere 21 years old , Hull is one of those truly unusual athletes who leap to the top of a sport after the briefest sort of apprenticeship . He came directly from amateur hockey to the big time  --  a rare enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third National Hockey League season , became the second-youngest player in history to win the scoring championship . The youngest by a matter of only 16 days was Harvey ( Busher ) Jackson , chief trigger man on the Toronto Maple Leafs ' Kid Line in 1931-32. // Affluence followed quickly on the heels of eminence this fall as Hull signed a five-year , $100,000 contract which brought him within slap-shot range of hockey 's highest-salaried players : Jean Beliveau and Doug Harvey of the Montreal Canadiens and Gordie Howe , Old Indispensable of the Detroit Red Wings , each of whom is paid approximately $25,000 a year . Hull 's contract is said to be almost identical with the proposal the Canadiens originally used to seduce Beliveau , a provincial idol , from the Quebec Aces. // As the new season opened last month , Hull began to pay back the Hawks ' investment with notable speed . Unbeaten in the first six games and with only three losses in the first 11 , the Hawks and Hull have been so hot that enchanted Chicago fans are becoming reckless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snatch the NHL title away from the Montreal Canadiens , who for the last three seasons have acted as though they owned it . // Never mind , say the fans , that the Hawks have never won the NHL championship and have n't been as high as second since 1934-35 . In a preseason poll of newsmen , they were a nearly unanimous choice to place second to Montreal , and since the season started they have jounced the Habs out of first place several times . Few can doubt that much of the credit for Chicago 's part in all this belongs to Bobby Hull . // Not only one of hockey 's finest , Hull is also its handsomest player . His hair is blond , his eyes blue and his smile uncommonly forthright and ingratiating . From the neck down he has the sculptured musculature of a Muscle Beach playboy . Hockey is not a game of giants , and at 5 feet 10 and 190 pounds Hull is literally a big man on the ice . // Some of the most effective players in hockey are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily overlook Gordie Howe , because the fabulous Detroit wing does everything so economically and with so little fuss that he seems almost to disappear in the clutch of bodies . But it would be impossible to overlook Bobby Hull . Game pads , jersey ( red at home , white on the road ) and bulky shorts give him a close-coupled , tanklike look , but when he is on the ice he moves excitingly and with the grace and fluency of a figure skater . There is a cheerful , vivid , freewheeling recklessness about him . He picks up the puck and sprints toward the enemy goal with the kind of jack-rabbit acceleration that marked Germany 's Olympic 100-meter track champion Armin Hary . Head up , eyes unblinkingly calculating , he seems almost visibly deciding whether to try to roughhouse past the defense or feed one of his linemates . Sometimes , given a shooting chance at close quarters , he will snap the puck away . At other moments , with a little more room , he takes a big backswing and gives the puck a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as hard  --  that is , not easily deflected . One goalie says it feels like lead when it chunks against him . // In a game in which tempers flare easily , skulls are sometimes cracked , blood frequently is drawn and teeth regularly are bashed in , Hull is a live-and-let-live player . He lost his own front teeth at the hands of an opposing player early in his career , but he is incapable of the wild rage that used to erupt in Rocket Richard , nor does he have the cold executioner 's touch of Howe , who exacts the traditional eye for eye and tooth for tooth whenever officials are looking elsewhere . Except for a stick-swinging brawl last year with New York Defenseman Lou Fontinato , the angry man whom NHL fans love to hate , Hull 's scraps have been routine and quickly forgotten . " I have the odd fight , " he says nonchalantly. // Happy-go-lucky , genial , a little cocky , Bobby Hull is still essentially the same gleeful kid who had more energy to expend than anyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on January 3 , 1939 . Point Anne is a company town tacked on to a local cement plant . Its fat twin smokestacks dominate the north , or mainland , shore of the Bay of Quinte . An arm of Ontario hooks out into the lake just across the bay from the town , and Toronto lies 120 miles to the west . " The population is aboat a thousand if you count the dogs , " says Hull 's 14-year-old sister , Judy , giving the ou sound a typically Canadian value . " Aboat a hundred if you don't. " // As the son of a cement company foreman , Bobby Hull grew up in a succession of company houses spotted here and there around the town . Bigger houses were needed from time to time as new Hulls arrived ( Bobby is the fifth oldest of 11 brothers and sisters ) . The family 's present lodgings are in a three-story stucco two-family house within 30 yards of the bay shore . Most of the brood is still young enough to live at home . // Bobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Big Island , just across the water from the Hull family home . There one day last summer , as Bobby tells the tale , " I had taken my boat out on the bay for a little water skiing with my wife , Joanne . We came back toward the end of the afternoon to have some barbecue with Mum and Dad and my grandfather  --  he 's over 80  --  and my cousin , Carol Cook . // " Then we all decided to go for a ride in the boat . It 's a 22-foot inboard runabout . I hit the starter . There must have been a gas leak . I guess the arc from the starter brushes ignited the fumes . Anyway , there was an explosion that knocked everybody down and blew the floor boards right out . The engine box tipped up , letting a blast of flame as hot as a welder 's torch catch Mum on the legs . Joanne was blown onto the dock . Dad bailed out and swam . I knew my cousin could swim , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the flames . I saw that grandfather was n't in danger , so I jumped overboard and sort of swam the boat back to the dock from where it had drifted . I was n't hurt at all , but Mum was hurt pretty bad . " // Mrs. Hull , alive and improving , but with her legs swathed in bandages , was still in the hospital at nearby Belleville two months later when I found my way to the neat stucco house in Point Anne . Mr. Hull was on hand , however , so with him and seven other members of the Hull family , I sat down to the most abundant dinner I had faced since a certain harvest meal before the war . // It was Sunday , and we ate chicken , dressing , potatoes , cauliflower with a cheese sauce , green beans , a green salad , a gelatin salad , a local Cheddar cheese and lemon meringue pie . The date cake looked good , too , but it arrived too late . // A glance at that loaded table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glance at his father , Robert Edward Hull , another . The elder Hull is a thick-chested 225-pounder with a booming voice and faded blond hair . When he had more of it , some years ago , he too was a well-known local hockey player called The Blond Flash . That was when he courted Bobby 's mother . // A duck to water // It was on the ice of the Bay of Quinte just outside the door of the Hulls ' house that Bobby himself learned to skate , to whack a puck straight and hard toward a makeshift goal and to use the strength he found in his stocky legs . // " We gave Robert a pair of skates for Christmas when he was n't quite 3 , " said Hull Sr. , helping himself to white meat and dressing . " I took him over to a frozen pond near home , and I 'll be darned if he was n't taking a few strides within a half hour . // " He learned to swim just as fast . One day he just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Begad , I had to wade in after him , clothes and all . " // " Hey , Maxine , " said Jackie Hull to another older sister of Bobby 's , " remember the time Bobby threw a tomato at you and hit you in the eye ? There never was a time when we could handle him . " // " Robert was always fast on his feet , " said Hull Sr. , picking up a wishbone and the thread of his reflections . " And strong . When he was 16 or so Robert worked in the plant here . On one job he had to use a jackhammer  --  way up high , above his shoulders  --  to loosen some firebrick in a kiln that was being shut down . I did n't see it , but a man told me he handled that jackhammer as if it was a toothpick. " // After dinner some of us called on Mrs. Hull at the hospital . She turned out to be a pleasant , ample woman with soft , dark hair and obvious pride in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost a night 's sleep over Robert or any of my children , " Mrs. Hull said . " I 'm only sorry that Peg here the youngest , aged 13 was n't twins . I 've always wanted to have twins . " // Just like a father // With his family 's encouragement , Bobby , like most Canadian youngsters , played hockey endlessly both at home and at school . He was 14 when a Chicago scout , Bob Wilson , spotted him and won him for the Hawks ' system . In his mid-teens he played Junior B amateur hockey , then Junior A for two years for the St. Catharines , Ont. , Teepees , who were then coached by the present Chicago coach , Rudy Pilous . Now a left wing , Hull at that time was a hard-skating center with no great reputation for reliability or teamwork . He recalls that at least once Pilous suspended him " for a couple of weeks . " // " I reprimanded Bobby , " says the Chicago coach , " just as some father would his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his muddy shoes . We were trying to get him to move the puck , to help set up plays , but he was headstrong and could n't see things our way . " // When , at 18 , Hull took that giant stride from St. Catharines to Chicago , he was still far from mature , on or off the ice . Domestically , he embarked on an unhappy marriage that fizzled out in divorce . ( His second wife , whom he married last spring , is a pretty , red-haired former ice-show skater . ) Professionally , he found it hard to give up the old take-the-puck-in-alone habit that had angered Pilous in St. Catharines . He was a sensational rookie , delighting the crowds and scoring a solid 47 points in his first big league season and 50 in his second , but he was still inexperienced enough to think he had to do it all himself . // The grand tour // Then came the trip to Europe and the lesson in the virtue of cooperation that turned Bobby Hull from a merely good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head as well as his stick . Despite his new status as a traveling hockey star , Hull was as awed as any other tourist when he arrived overseas in 1959 to play a series of exhibition games . Even though his schedule called for 23 games in 25 nights , Bobby was determined not to miss a thing on the way . He saw virtually every sight there was to see between London and Vienna , doggedly walked through every museum and climbed every recommended staircase , including the one that leads to the top of France 's Eiffel Tower . " After that , " says Bobby in thoughtful reminiscence , " I was so tired that I could n't have taken the puck down the ice alone and put it in if I 'd wanted to . I had to learn to pass it off . And the best part of all was that I still came out the leading scorer . " // His lesson learned , Bobby Hull de-emphasized his rhinoceros charges and spruced up his team play so remarkably last season that he collected 39 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the scoring title by a single point on the final night . He did " the hat trick " ( three goals in a single game ) three times , and in one game murdered Toronto with four goals . // Shortly after the season opened Bobby was given Red Hay , 25 , a big , rawboned Colorado College star , as center , and compact , dark-haired Murray Balfour , 24 , as right wing . // They went together like ham , eggs and home fries . Playmaker Hay won the rookie-of-the-year award , and Balfour turned out to be the kind of hard-digging corner man every good line needs . He and Hay both scored 18 goals , a record roughly equivalent to a .300 batting average in baseball . // At this point General Manager Tommy Ivan says he would n't take a million dollars for the Hull line and , as if to prove it , he has done all he can to back it up . Goalie Glenn Hall , three times an All-Star , is as good as any in the league @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center Ed Litzenberger has recovered from the emotional crisis of an automobile accident in which his wife was killed last winter , he should again be the 30-goal man he used to be . Aging Center Tod Sloan is a steady balance wheel . Ab McDonald , Stan Mikita and bellicose Reg Fleming are among the league 's most promising young forwards . // Turning tide // A sound team and certainly an entertaining one , the Hawks at this point fall just short of being a really superior one . It is distinctly possible , however , that the tide of power in the NHL may be slowly swinging from Montreal to Chicago , just as it swung from Detroit to Montreal not so long ago . In recent weeks the Canadiens have faltered time and again . They have lost the great Rocket Richard , and their veterans are fast growing old . For example , Defense-men Doug Harvey , 36 , and Tom Johnson , 32  --  the NHL 's best  --  are in their 14th and 11th seasons , respectively . When the time comes , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the league , coaches and managers are praying and searching for signs of greatness in their youngsters . In 22-year-old Carl Brewer , Toronto has a defenseman who has the potential to be one of the finest . New York has Jack McCartan , the Olympic hero , and Jack not only has great promise but real magnetism at the box office . Montreal , of course , has its great reputation . But right now none of them has what Chicago has , for Chicago has Hull , and Hull has everything .
