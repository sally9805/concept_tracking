Preoccupied with the war in Viet Nam , the U.S. sometimes forgets that a similar struggle against Red rebels was won . in the Philippines . Under relentless pressure from President Ramon Magsaysay 's counterguerrilla forces , Philippine Communist Leader Luis Taruc surrendered a decade ago and accepted amnesty , ceding command of 56,000 remaining Hukbalahap guerrillas to Jesus Lava , a wiry physician . <P> One steaming noon last week , intelligence agents of the Philippine Constabulary closed in on a modest clapboard house near Manila 's center and roused a pale , gaunt man from a pre-lunch nap . His indignant protest of innocence lasted only until the agents found letters from Mao Tse-tung and other top Communist leaders . When confronted by the now respectable Luis Taruc , he admitted he was Jesus Lava , 51 , general secretary of the Philippine Communist Party . After years in the backwoods , Lava had apparently come to Manila to visit his family . <P> Though Lava faced trials for armed rebellion and murder , he was taken to Malacanan Palace for an almost cordial interview with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the once powerful Huks are no longer a serious threat in the Philippines , even though economic instability and corruption remain dangerous ; the hard-core armed Huks probably number only a few hundred , and they may be able to draw on perhaps 10,000 supporters in remote Mindanao and Luzon . Successor to Lava as leader of the Huks is Pedro Taruc , cousin to Luis , who seems determined to continue desultory attacks on remote villages .
