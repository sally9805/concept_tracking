Whether she did it to catch a prince , like Rapunzel , or to avoid a taxing situation , like Godiva , the girl who took down her hair in days of yore never thought twice about the trouble involved . But then , why should she ? She had nothing to undo but a braid or a ribbon and presto , crowning glorysville ! It is only the modern maid who spends the better part of her days putting up her hair and is not about to take it down until she 's good and ready . <P> Women have been going about in curlers for years , always in the hope of getting crinkles to wave , waves to coil , coils to stand up and be counted . Fortunately , the means to curly ends-bobby pins , hairpins , miniature rollers or just plain rags-could be easily camouflaged around the house . In public , the works could be concealed under a snood or scarf , even fitted accommodatingly under a bathing cap . Most important , the head that hit the pillow ( encompassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry about going to sleep : the weight of a million bobby pins , in fact , often proved a sort of sedative . <P> But times have changed , and so have hair styles . Curls today are for the birds , and French poodles . Current styles call for sleek , straight hair . It is a look made possible only by the use of rollers , metal or plastic , ranging up to 3 in. in diameter and designed to subdue , not support , the slightest hint of curl . What rollers cost is sleep , and women who can not get used to a Japanese wooden neck rest have only one choice : set at dusk and sit up till dawn or set by day , rest easy at night . <P> Accordingly , rollers have rolled out from bathroom cabinets and dressing-table drawers . Impossible to conceal , gaudy in color , they make a display of what was once an embarrassment . Increasingly , these Saturdays , the odd woman in almost any suburban shopping center is the one without rollers . Rollered women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , put their rollered heads together over a bridge table , even go to confession rollered . <P> <P> The rollered lady seems to be living in some perpetual state of anticipation ; she has taken her mark , got set , and is ready to go , always-by implication-to an event deemed more important than what she is presently doing . But the day may come when the rollers never come off at all ; at opening nights and White House dinners , the ladies may come coiffed in rollered color , bright as an op painting , brittle as a petrified forest .
