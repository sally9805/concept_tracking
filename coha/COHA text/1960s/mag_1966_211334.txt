COLLEGE FOOTBALL <P> It does n't pay to get Notre Dame mad . Michigan State 's Spartans hooted that the Fighting Irish were " sissies " two weeks ago , after Notre Dame played it safe in the game 's final minute and settled for a 10-10 tie . Last week Southern California , the nation 's No. 10-ranked team , faced the Irish wrath . Notre Dame Quarterback Coley O'Brien , subbing for injured Terry Hanratty , passed for 255 yds. , and his mates gained another 206 on the ground . Final score in the slaughter : 51-0-which ought to make Purdue a prohibitive favorite against Southern Cal in the Rose Bowl on Jan. 2 . After all , Notre Dame only beat the Boilermakers 26-14.
