In three acts , this small-bore saga of the peacetime army in the mid- ' 50s rarely hits a comic target that has not already been riddled in the long and simple-minded annals of G.I. humor . <P> Lieut . Stanley Poole ( Darren McGavin ) , a hard-bitten campaigner , has been frightened out of his dimmish wits by a directive . To hold his rank , he must pass a college test ; to pass the test , he is bribing the post education officer with every last field jacket and wall locker in his supply room . Peter Fonda , an egghead private who goes psycho at the sight of an unsheathed bayonet , offers to tutor McGavin , and soon he is running a class for every Neanderthal man on the post . <P> Thin as a soda straw , but vastly more resilient , Fonda makes a personable Broadway debut as the third of the acting Fondas ( Father Henry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adenoidal monsters that only a first sergeant could love show up for roll call in Stanley Poole , and the laughs are mostly AWOL.
