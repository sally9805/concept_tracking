txt Letters pg . 297 Letters WELLS ON A MOLT TERROR ' To THE EDITOR. : Godfrey Smith in " An Outline of H. G. Wells " ( Aug. 21 ) quotes an excellent description of New York in the nineteen-sixties written by Wells in 1908 , but he seems to have missed a yet more impressive instance where reality copied Wells 's fiction . Ia the novel " The Holy Terror , " published in 1939 , the name of the protagonist is a rather . obvious parody on Adolf Hitler , but his resemblance to the Nazi dictator ends there . What is surprising is how closely the plot of the story anticipates the last three or four years of Stalin 's life . There is the same " cult of personality , " culminating in a-great international celebration of the dictator 's birthday ; his conversion late in life to anti-Semitism , of which he had shown no signs in his earlier career ; a massive frame-up and purge of doctors ; he dies under exceedingly suspicious circumstances , while he is planning a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded by a " collective leadership . " ( Neither Khrushchev nor his successors are on the scene as the story closes . ) For the most part this must be sheer coincidence , but as Wells knew Stalin personally he was probably influenced in writing the book , more than he himself realized , by a shrewd prognosis of how a man of that character would be affected by absolute power . T. S. HOLMAN . Delwanna , N.J. PIKE ON PIKE To THE EDITOR : Naturally , I was interested in ? indeed , gratified by ? John Cogley 's " From Pulpit to Think Tank " ( Aug. 14 ) . Quite apart from the subject matter , it is a fine piece of writing  --  and of understanding . However , -I did n't say " I am no longer primarily concerned with the question : Is it true or is n't it ? " That is , in fact , what I am primarily concerned with in regard to various doctrinal traditions . Then , where on a given point the answer is affirmative , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ing ?

Santa Barbara , Calif . LOIRE 'S GLASS To THE Borrow The cover of the Magazine section for August 14 showed // Letters // a beautiful reproduction of two new stained glass windows of the Grace Cathedral in San Francisco . I think it is a shame that nowhere was mention made that these windows were designed and executed by the great French artist Gabriel Loire of Chartres , France . In addition to the San Francisco windows , he has been responsible for a number of other magnificent examples of what he calls vitraux d'art . Among them are the sculptured glass panels for the remarkable double octagonal walls surrounding the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in West Berlin . Here in New York a fine example of his work can be seen in the four windows depicting the Creation , Flood , Birth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Marble Collegiate Church at Fifth Avenue and 29th Street . JOHN M. KYLE . New York . A SOUTH AFRICAN 'S VIEW OF FISCHER To THE EDITOR : I was indeed interested in Nadine Gordimer 's article " Why Did Bram Fischer Choose Jail ? " ( Aug. 14 ) and what she said about our leading self-confessed ' and unrepentant Communist We live in astonishing days . All values have turned topsy-turvy . Here we find a man who would be regarded with the deepest suspicion in the United rStates of America ; who might indeed receive the full penalty in America for un-American activities ; who would not hesitate to bring the full weight of the power of Communism to the civil-rights issue in your country . This man , we find , is now regarded as a hero simply because he , as a Communist , has sided with the agitators who would turn South Africa from a happy , quiet contented country into another Congo or Algeria . Of course , much of what Mrs. Gordimer writes is true : Fischer was a man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center of a great Communist conspiracy here , he was all the more dangerous because of his personable characteristics . It is truly incredible that a man like that can be held up to the great American public through the medium of The New York Times as a saintlIke being . First and foremost he was and is a traitor to his own Afrikaner people ; secondly , he is a traitor to his class ( because the Communists wish to deprive people of the class he really belonged to of their rights and their privileges and their wealth , etc. , etc. ) , and , thirdly , he was fundamentally a coward because he used stooges to do his dirty work while he maintained the facade of righteousness . It was Fischer who set young people on to sabotage while he remained in the background . A. N. WILSON . Johannesburg .

In the interest of fairness and accuracy and as a tribute to the memory of a fine Syracuse photographer , I hope you will point out this fact to your readers . RICHARD F. LONG , Newhouse National News Service . Washington , D. C. WAGES IN AFRICA 'S COPPERBELT TO THE EDITOR : Lloyd Garrison 's article on President Kaunda of Zambia ( " Africa 's ' Good Guy ' Under Pressure , " Aug. 7 ) is a sensitive portrayal of the man and a brilliant description of the dilemma which U. D. I. Ian Smith 's " Unilateral Declaration of Independence " for Rhodesia poses for him and his ideals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comparison Garrison makes of the earnings of whites and Africans in the copper mining industry of Zambia . His figures ( $7,180 for whites and $828 for Africans ) would seem to relate to the annual average earnings for the year 1962 . Thus , they do not take into account the important increases in African earnings during the past three years which , by 1965 , have brought them to an annual average of $1,155 , an increase of 40 per cent in three years  --  and this before the sizable increases put into effect in January , 1966 . The earnings of whites in Zambian mining have increased 5 per cent since 1962 . It is more meaningful yet to note that African earnings in copper mining are now three times their level of $370 in 1954 . During that period , . the earnings of whites in Zambian mining increased less than 30 per cent . As the whites occupy jobs of much greater skill than those performed by most Africans , the best comparison is with wage rates paid to the highest categories of African workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most skilled underground African workers is $2,580 and the wage scale for African underground shift bosses and foremen is $4,200 a year . African workers are being rapidly advanced into these categories . Ten years ago , indeed five years ago , no such categories existed . These figures indicate the substantial progress that is being made in closing the gap between the earnings of Zambians and expatriates in the Copperbelt . F.
