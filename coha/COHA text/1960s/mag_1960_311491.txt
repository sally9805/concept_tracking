The beer that might have made Moscow famous is a light , frothy brew called Zhiguli , which has long been touted as the perfect accompaniment for rak , a Russian crawfish . But for some time , Muscovites - and beer drinkers all over the U.S.S.R. - have noticed that their Zhiguli had lost its zip . Last week they knew why . Up for trial and denounced for his " criminally careless attitude " was V. P. Lisakov , director of Moscow 's biggest brewery . The dark charge against Lisakov , Senior Brewmaster P. D. Kirichek , and eight other brewery officials : watering the Zhiguli . <P> The scandal got started when the brewers carelessly began washing down their vats with beer instead of water , ignoring leaky valves that spilled out brew until it ran in the gutters . The brewery workers ran up " internal losses " amounting to 2,500,000 gallons of beer worth 40 million rubles-owing in part to on-the-job consumption . In order to make up their quota , they began putting water in the Zhiguli ( named for a Volga River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in unexpectedly and found the water content too high , brewery officials and workers kept pouring it in . When a formidable team of ministry investigators moved in , officials tried to get out of the mess by cutting the beer 's aging period from 21 days to 3 , using extra malt , juggling the books , rigging scales so that no one could check the output . In despair , Brewmaster Kirichek suggested they puncture the pipes , blame the losses on an accident . <P> No subterfuge worked . The luckless Zhiguli brewers were hauled in to answer to 40 volumes full of violations . Wrote the Economic Gazette , an official newspaper of the Communist Party 's Central Committee : " Starting with a small violation of state discipline , they ended up deceiving the state . " That , as every Communist knew , was a crime far worse than watering beer . Nonetheless , it would be a long time before Russian beer drinkers again looked on Zhiguli as they once did-perhaps not until a crawfish learns to whistle .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
