txt Sir Alec ? " Our aim and function is to conserve the strength and security of Britain ; to conserve and expand our economic strength so that prosperity can be widely shared and wisely used at home ; to maintain our security from any outside threat so that from a basis of security we may speak and act with authority in the world in the pursuit of peace and justice . " Mr. Wilson ? " Our appeal is to the people of Britain to recognize that we can do better than we are doing  --  that with extra effort and partnership we can have better education , better housing , better social security , and ever-widening fields of opportunity for all our people . This is the issue in the campaign . " Plans and Programs : Sir Alec ? " First , all of our plans for the future stem from past success . They are a continuation and development of policies which have been shown to work . Second , we have in every case counted the cost ; and thirdly , while both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnership , theirs is planning by compulsion . " Mr. Wilson ? " Had . . the government accepted in 1961 the program of expansionism that they have now accepted in their preelection conversion , we should not only have had the production needed for a great program of social progress , but the standard of living , as measured in terms of our spending power , measured by wages and salaries , would have risen not by 8 percent from 1961 to 1964 , but by 14 ' percent . " A Free Market ? Sir Alec ? " We believe in a society where there is free and ample choice . With the social ' ists , direction is always close under the surface . That is the philosophy behind the state ownership of a key industry like steel .... A new superminister is to direct all our economic future ; state ownership , direction , control . " Mr. Wilson ? " The Tories think in terms of a free market in housing . We think in terms of a social service , for our concern is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those families to live in communities .... It is no use talking about a free market : the provision of decent housing for all is a clear and inescapable obligation of government . " So we say again , this must be tackled like a wartime operation . When we needed the guns , the tanks , we made them a war priority , we mobilized the resources of the country to produce them , without regard to private interest or private profit . This is what we shall do for houses . " Cost of Living : Sir Alec ? " No country has managed to stop prices rising completely . Ours has done better than most ? as anyone who has holidayed abroad will know . . . . " Mr. Wilson ? " I am not surprised that no Conservative leader answered my challenge . to compare rise in living standards in Britain since the 1959 election with that achieved in every comparable industrial country . In socialist Sweden , for example , real income per head has risen twice as fast since 1959 as in Tory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will justify our claim to support by the fact of improvement of the standard of living which every fair-minded person must admit . Everyone can see the advance in the health of the children , in the service of education , in the provision of houses and in the fresh amenities of life and the opportunities which are now within the reach of all . - " This is prosperity with a purpose and it is here now and increasing fast . The socialists talk as though all this can be taken for granted and then proceed to knock away all the props on which prosperity is based . These gains have not been won easily and they could be lost easily . Perhaps the quickest way to lose them would be to fall for all the promises which are in the socialist manifesto . There is apparently something for all but there is a catch in it for it is a menu without prices . " Mr. Wilson ? " In the past month we have been subjected to a barrage of advertising copy which claims that our opponents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to hold the standard of living down , are now saying that you must have Consservative government to keel , what you now enjoy ... // British Scan Party Themes // " Tory posters and publicity claim that they created this modest prosperity .. . . The British people , Sir Alec says , should recognize their good fortune . Yet even rise in the standard of living has been achieved not because of government policy , but in the face of the government 's strongest opposition . " Housing : Sir Alec ? " We Conservatives . . have devised our future programs of social advance with a very close eye on ability to pay . What we do pledge is continued progress . More houses ? 400,000 d year ? the virtual abolition of the slums within 10 years , more hospi tals , clinics , welfare centers , a doubling of the massive road program , and more schools , colleges , and universities to house and teach the young . All these have been costed and can be attained with a 4 percent rate of annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 13 years of Conservative rule , we had fulfilled the program of a 4 percent production increase per annum ... we would have had a national income of ? 5,500 million ( $15.4 billion ) higher than it is , equivalent to ? 3 10 shillings ( $9.80 ) to ? 4 ( $11.20 ) a week for every family in this country . . . . " A higher standard of living must be measured not only by what goes into a household , but what goes out  --  and what your living conditions are like . .. This is why we shall fight to see that our prosperity is more fairly shared , that the scales are weighted more in favor of the ordinary family . For as socialists we care about people . " And it is because we care that we shall mobilize the re ? sources of this country to produce more houses  --  and this means fighting the land racketeer , the unscrupulous private landlord , and inefficiency in the building industry . We shall deal with all the houses which , in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age 11k million houses in this country have no bath , 11/2 million no indoor sanitation. 11/2 million no hot-water system . We shall end the evils of the Rent Act and restore the security of tenure , and create machinery to fix reasonable rents . " Land Profits : Sir Aleo ? " The cost of land has been rising in recent years , the almost inevitable result of a prospering society 's greatly increased demand for housing on an overcrowded island . " The solution is clear  --  to release more land for housing and to build more houses . And this we are doing and the eifeet will he progressively sees . In the meantime high prices are creating ? in some cases  --  considerable profits . " It was to see that some of these profits went to the community that . . . we put a tax on land transactions . . . . But if we are to go further than we have done ... we must be clear as to our objective . . . . We want to be certain when we tackle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prices or dry up the supply . Practically all the suggested taxes result in one or the other . And so , in particular , would the Labor Party 's plan ' to nationalize the freehold of all urban building land . " Incomes Policy : Sir Alec ? " Conservatives ask for the support of the country to go ahead with our policies for prosperity with a purpose and power for peace . . . . In all these policies we act on the principle that the expanded wealth of the country should be shared but that this wealth must first be earned . " Mr. Wilson ? " The Labor Party 's position on an incomes policy has been clear all along . We have said .. that wages and all other incomes ? I stress all other incomes  --  can not be allowed to rise faster than our national productivity . "
