txt A legislative committee reported today that the state 's $1-billion Medicaid program was being bilked of as much as $60-million a year by unscrupulous doctors , dentists , pharmacists and medical institutions . It said their tactics ranged from falsification and padding of bills to unnecessary referrals to specialists . In an interim report sent to the majority leaders of both houses , the Joint Legislative Committee on Public Health , headed by State Senator Norman F. Lent , Nassau Republican , urged the passage of legislation imposing " penalties for those providers of services who intentionally falsify their claims or intentionally overuse the program for the purpose of padding their bills . Spokesmen for both the state 's dental and medical societies said they had not seen the report and could not comment on it in detail . Dr. Walter T. Heldmann , president of the Medical Society of the State of New York , said that " so far as physicians go " the committee figure of between $50-million and $60-million in losses " is ridiculous to begin with . " He said private physicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's $1-billion in Medicaid funds and added that he was " sure " the committee " did n't mean that better than 50 per cent of the money spent on physicians was paid needlessly . " Dr. Percy T. Phillips , secretary of the New York State Dental Society , said charges of " fraudulence " have been " blown all out of proportion . " Both doctors said that the vast bulk of Medicaid funds were received directly by hospitals , nursing homes and the like and not by private practitioners . The committee report also recommended the enactment of laws making Medicaid recipients liable for providing false information to obtain benefits . Under the Medicaid program , Federal , state and local funds are used to pay the full or partial medical bills of those deemed medically indigent . According to state welfare officials , 2,750,000 people are currently enrolled in Medicaid . About half of them are on the relief rolls , but about 1.3 million are not and they are currently required to pay 20 per cent of the cost of medical services and supplies other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with less than $5,000-a-year income is eligible for Medicaid . Joseph Jaspan , counsel to the committee , which consists of seven Republicans and ? four Democrats , said there was a need for " firm state legislation " dealing with abuses in the Medicaid program because existing legislation was " uncertain . " " We want absolute prohibition , " Mr. Jaspan said in an interview . He said he knew of no instances in which the state had prosecuted professionals or institutions in the program , although he said there had been suspensions of doctors from the Medicaid program . He added that legislation to lie introduced early next month would provide for penalties of up to one year in jail for those convicted of Medicaid abuses . Mr. Jaspan said that the $60-million figure was " an estimate " arrived at after the committee had interviewed social services commissioners in a series of hearings in the state . He said there was no comparable figure for Medicaid recipients falsely representing themselves in the program " and added that the information available to'date indicated that the number of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called for a study to determine whether Medicaid should be administered by a single agency rather than by the State Social Services Department and the Health Department , as it is now . Citing comments by officials of both departments concerning duplication , bureaucratic confusion , delay and differences of interpretation of regulations , the committee said such a study was desirable " to determine whether a merger is economically and administratively sound . " Law Being Studied In the meantime , the report said , the committee is studying the existing laws governing the huge Medicaid program , much , of which is paid with 50 perk cent Federal funds and with the state and the localities splitting the remainder , " for the purpose of suggesting legislative and administrative changes . " The committee 's report . drafted after six months of study as well as public and private hearings , said that despite objections from the medical profession that " overseeing " of their conduct was " an unwarranted intrusion into their professional lives , " there was " substantial reason to impose some pre-treatment yegulation and require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of health services . " The committee 's interviews with social service commissioners showed evidence of " unacceptable practices , " the report said . These practices included rendering bills for services that were not provided ; the administration of tests unrelated to the needs of the patient ; unnecessary referral of patients to one or more specialists ; provision of fewer drugs and supplies than were written in prescriptions along with altering of prescriptions and the administering of inadequate medical examinations and the performance of inferior dental work . " The cumulative evidence , " the report said , " indicates that appropriate review procedures in all counties would enable recapture and savings of the $50-60-million now believed to be lost to the program each year by reason of fraud , abuse , misuse and overuse . " Watchdog System ' Started The committee cited a special S800,000 appropriation made to New York City to provide for a Medicaid " watchdog system " and urged that similar systems be established throughout the state . As part of the city 's supervision of Medicaid , the Health Department sends medical investigators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check on services performed and the amounts paid for these services .
