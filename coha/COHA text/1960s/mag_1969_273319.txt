DURING the Korean War , brainwashing of U.S. prisoners by Chinese and North Koreans produced alarming numbers of forced " confessions , " collaborators and turncoats . As a result , President Eisenhower issued an executive order in 1955 establishing a Code of Conduct for U.S. servicemen . Among its provisions : <P> &gt; I will never surrender of my own free will . If in command , I will never surrender my men while they still have the means to resist . <P> &gt; If I am captured , I will continue to resist by all means available . I will make every effort to escape and aid others to escape . I will accept neither parole nor special favors from the enemy . &gt; When questioned , should I become a prisoner of war , I am bound to give only my name , rank , service number and date of birth . I will evade answering further questions to the utmost of my ability . I will make no oral or written statements disloyal to my country and its allies , or harmful to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not been applied in a single case . It was not used , for example , against two captured soldiers who were cleared of charges that they made anti-U.S . statements before they were freed by the Viet Cong in 1965 . The Navy 's dilemma over the Pueblo incident sharply underlines the code 's shortcomings . The code can not be enforced , since it carries no penalties ; such offenses as informing and revealing classified information to the enemy are indeed punishable , but under the Uniform Code of Military Justice , not under the Code of Conduct . But if the Code of Conduct can not be applied , particularly in as well-publicized a case as Pueblo , it will soon become a dead letter . <P> The Defense Department insists that the Code of Conduct is " militarily binding . " Most authorities , however , agree with a naval judge advocate , Captain Gale Krouse , who argued otherwise last week in San Diego . Pointing out that the Code of Conduct is not part of the U.C.M.J. , Krouse said : " Failure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind a criminal offense . " In any event , finding a middle course between the needs of military discipline and compassion for the plight of prisoners of war will be a difficult job of legal navigation .
