The sound of Christmas in Katanga province was the thunk of mortar shells and the rattle of machine guns . After an uneasy twelve-month truce between U.N . forces and the troops of Katanga 's Secessionist Moise Tshombe , a few minor incidents got out of hand , and for the third time since September 1961 the province was in turmoil . Blue-helmeted U.N . soldiers swarmed through Elisabethville , seized roadblocks on the highways . Swedish U.N . Saab jets swooped low over Katanga 's airfield at Kolwezi , destroying four planes on the ground and setting oil tanks ablaze . In the first skirmishes , seven U.N . soldiers were dead . <P> The fighting began with what Elisabethville residents call " L'Affaire Simba " -a reference to Simba beer , the local brew that both sides guzzled on and off duty . As the U.N . told it , boozed-up Katangese gendarmes suddenly opened fire on a detachment of Ethiopian U.N . troops in suburban Lubumbashi . As Tshombe described matters , a few tipsy Ethiopians started the shooting by scrambling atop a 200-ft. slag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Katangese . <P> Fireworks Next . In any case , Katangese soldiers at a golf course on the outskirts of Elisabethville took the occasion to shoot down an unarmed U.N . helicopter moving overhead . They stoned the six surviving crewmen , pummeled them with rifle butts ; a 23-year-old Sikh lieutenant , who lay helpless with a machine gun slug in the abdomen , died unattended in three hours . Indian Brigadier Reginald Noronha , commander of U.N . troops in Katanga 's capital , was furious . " This is the last time , " he said . " Next time there are going to be fireworks . " <P> Noronha did not have long to wait . Three days later an Ethiopian guard fired a warning shot at a Katangese soldier who was approaching his post . Unhurt , the Katangese rolled down a hill in search of cover , but his comrades thought he had been hit and opened fire . Soon U.N . positions around the city were under attack . Tshombe " agreed " ' to a ceasefire , but his 20,000 men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said a Red Cross official who saw them rampaging through a township , firing at anything that moved . " They are killing their own men . " <P> The U.N . claimed Tshombe had lost control of his men-which gave it an excuse to strike back . From Manhattan U.N . headquarters , orders were flashed to the 12,000-man U.N . force in Katanga : " Take all necessary action in self-defense and to restore order . " Spearheaded by 5,700 tough , bitter Gurkhas , the U.N . force methodically swept disorganized Katangese troops from their guardposts on the road to Northern Rhodesia . Power lines fell in the fray , leaving shabby little Elisabethville ( pop . 180,000 ) without light , water or phones .
