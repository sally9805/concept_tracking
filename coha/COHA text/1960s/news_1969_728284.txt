txt Arthur F. Burns , who is to become chairman of the Federal Reserve Board , said today he thought there should be some relaxation of the current extremely restrictive monetary policy when the right " foundation " had been laid in the form of balanced budgets for both the present and the next fiscal year . Dr. Burns , who was confirmed by the Senate today to replace William McChesney Martin Jr. , told the Banking Committee before his confirmation that he ? believed long continuation of severely tight money would " prove very dangerous for the economy . " In Stocks Lifted by Remarks The remarks by Dr. Burns touched off a rally in stock prices that sent the DowJones industrial average soaring 13.86 points , to 783.79 , its best gain since April 30 . On Wednesday , the index had reached a low for the year . " normal conditions , " he said , he would favor its relaxation immediately . But the problem , Dr. Burns said repeatedly , is one of the " credibility " of the ' Government 's determination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of belief in the business and financial community , he stressed , makes the present " not a normal time . " The key budgetary questions , Dr. Burns said , should be settled ? one way or the other " in the next two to four weeks . " He referred to final Congressional actions on taxes and spending and to the President 's new budget for fiscal 1971 . Dr. Burns expressed his strong hope that the President could present a budget " a little below $200-billion . " He said this would be " very , very difficult . " If it can not be done and the budget would therefore be in deficit , he continued , " we must raise taxes , as unpopular as that may be . " Dr. Burns testified for nearly two hours ' nefore an entirely friendly , but probing , commit- // tee . Immediately after the hear ing , the committee approved the nomination and , by midafternoon , it had cleared the Senate . Dr. Burns will not take office until next Feb. 1 . The testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burns did not hesitate to give his views on nearly all of them , though on many he said his present sentiments were " tentative " and subject to further study when he assumes office . These were some highlights : IIHe found a " danger " of a recession but said , " I think we can avoid it . " The prediction of a recession by Prof. Milton Friedman of the University of Chicago " is a little premature , " Dr. Burns said . lHis " impulse " is to agree with the Congressional Joint Economic Committee that the target for Federal Reserve policy should be growth of the money supply in a range of 2 to 6 per cent a year  --  a target the Reserve has not accepted and that Professor Friedman backs . In the last six months , growth of the money supply has been close to zero . cHe fully believes that the Reserve should not be the " handmaiden " of the Treasury and should preserve its independence . " We may have to go to war with the Treasury , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not happen . ( We believes the Reserve should continue to have a function in the field of bank regulation , apart from the conduct of monetary policy . CHe disclosed that the Reserve has made an unpublished study revealing a " very marked " decline in bank-loan commitments to business  --  evidence , he said , that monetary policy is now affecting large banks and the business sector of the economy and not only such sectors as housing . cHe favored establishment of a secondary market for " conventional " ( non-Governmentbacked ) mortgages , but said it would not help in the present housing crisis . CIA " sizable reduction " is now planned for military spending in the new budget . ( Die believes the needed slowing of the economy can be accomplished without a " significant " increase in unemployment , partly with the help of such devices as " job banks " to match the unemployed with vacant jobs . cThe present 71/2 per cent interest ceiling on Federal Housing Administration and Veterans Administration mortgages should be raised . cHe does not believe price land wage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly because public cooperation would be " very limited . " ' ciHe has " doubts " about the Reserve 's use of interest-rate ceilings  --  known as Regulation Q  --  as a device of monetary control , but he was " not prepared to say the Federal Reserve has been wrong . " Despite all these comments , Mr. Burns 's basic theme ? brought out by tile questioning ? was the need for more fiscal , meaning budgetary , restraint on the economy , to ease the burden on monetary policy and to restore " confidence " in the Government 's will to curb inflation . In this he differed not at all from the views of the present chairman . Mr. Martin . The President 's projected surplus of almost $6-billion in the current fiscal year 's budget is in " gave danger , " Dr. Burns ' said . If matters continued on their present course , he added , " I doubt if there will be any surplus and there may even be a deficit . " Apart from potential actions of Congress on both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a belief that both corporate and personal income tax receipts will be below present estimates ? corporate taxes because of the current slide in profits and individual taxes because many taxpayers will take advantage of the drop in the stock market to take losses and reduce their tax liability . " A restrictive monetary policy , if pursued very long , will damage the economy , " Dr. Burns said . " We must therefore rely on a sound fiscal policy and not leave it to the monetary authorities to do it all by themselves . " He added , however , that " if the President and Congress make mistakes on fiscal policy , it is by no means clear to me that the Federal Reserve must try to correct for every error they make .
