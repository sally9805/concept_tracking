Western Europe last week was amazed and bemused at the sight of the rich U.S. suddenly talking like a poor relation . Cartoonists pictured a tattered Ike holding out his hat as horrified Economics Min ister Ludwig Erhard told West German Chancellor Adenauer , " He says we have to make the same sacrifices in peacetime as we did during the war ! " In Bonn , at a dinner given by the U.S. embassy for Secretary of the Treasury Anderson , one very senior German whispered jokingly to a colleague : " I hope the ambassador can afford to feed us . " The London Daily Herald had a nice old British lady tiptoe up to five G.I.s and offer to repay past U.S. generosity by sending food parcels to help " your dear ones over the economic crisis . " The Daily Mail 's Columnist John Jelley found a silver lining in the gold crisis ( see BUSINESS ) , because now Americans " will be forced to realize that the world is not , after all , half antique shop and half soup kitchen with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once again start looking towards our own ingenuity and enterprise and guts to protect us against the squalls and earthquakes of an unstable world . " <P> Punch hurried valiantly into the breach with a supposititious Tourist Council brochure , which assures impoverished Americans that they are still welcome in Britain , where " our hospitality can be tailored to your diminished purse . " Some helpful items : <P> " In the days of your prosperity you would doubtless have made the conventional rounds , London , Stratford , Winchester , Bath , Windsor , walking on a carpet of your own dollars . Today , when every cent must pay its way , new glories await you . " In inexpensive Staffordshire , visit " Walsall , one of the few guidebook towns with absolutely nothing under ' Features of Interest ' " or " nearby Smethwick , with its locally popular Victoria Public Park ( no charge ) .

" A cheap half-day tour : " two building sites , waits in selected Mayfair bus-queues , a good look at Aldgate Pump . " <P> In a final edged note . Punch presents useful new phrases tailored to newly poor U.S. tourists . Recommends Punch : In stead of saying . " Will you folk never learn to make a chilled martini ? " , say " I am acquiring a taste for mild ale . " For " Yeah , we did Scotland last week-end , " substitute " I think we can afford the fare to Banbury . " For " Keep the change , kid . " try " Thank you . " <P> The U.S. 's allies were properly appreciative of the seriousness of the U.S. plight , and in serious moments serious about it . But some found it hard at all times to keep an altogether straight face .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
