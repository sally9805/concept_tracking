Communist China and the American defectors it wooed after the Korean War seem to have sadly disappointed each other . Of the 21 defectors , a dozen came back to the U.S. , five took up residence in other parts of the world , and one died in China . Last week Clarence S. ( " Skippy " ) Adams , 37 , a slender Negro from Memphis who was captured in North Korea in late 1950 , became the 18th turncoat to forsake the Communists . That leaves only two still in Red China , and Adams believes that one of them is about to leave . Said Adams , after arriving in San Francisco with his Chinese wife and their two children : " I think that they were as happy to get rid of me as I was to leave . " <P> Constant Indoctrination . Things were not always that way . A Tennessee boy who had never been out of the state until he joined the Army at 18 , Adams , after his defection , went to People 's University in Peking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mandarin and other Chinese languages . He met and married Liu Lin-feng , a teacher of Russian and the daughter of a deceased war lord , was given a job as a translator for the Foreign Languages Press at about $85 a month . He lived well by Chinese standards in a three-room apartment , had access to Western publications ( including TIME ) because of his work . Despite constant indoctrination at every stage of his life in China , the great promise of China began to dim : " In China , the people are not free of mind . They do n't dare conflict with the official view . " <P> First , Adams discovered the emptiness of one of the promises that had lured him to China : racial equality . On two occasions , he got into scuffles over racial slurs . He also began to be stifled by the indoctrination and the joylessness of Red Chinese life . " The Chinese have no sense of humor , " says Adams . " When you go to the movies there , you do n't go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for recreation , he began visiting Peking 's African embassies " to hear music , to dance and to talk freely . " The Chinese did not like it , urged him to break off contact with the Africans . When he asked to leave China , they quickly agreed . <P> A Rest from Polemics . Eighteen months ago Adams taped two broadcasts urging Negro U.S. soldiers in Viet Nam to put down their arms and return home to fight for racial equality , but he insists that " I never considered myself a Communist . " Now , he wisely has little to say about the war except that " we have to find some way to solve it . " After visiting his mother in Memphis , he hopes to get a job teaching Mandarin , lead " a quiet life " with his family . As for civil rights or antiwar demonstrations , he says that he wants no part of them . After more than 15 years with the Chinese Communists , Clarence Adams feels that he needs a rest from polemics .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
