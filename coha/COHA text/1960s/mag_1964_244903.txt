Wall Street greeted the July 4 weekend with a bang . After going nowhere for six puzzling weeks , the Dow-Jones index of industrial shares reached new records in four out of five trading sessions , climbed 101 points for the week to close at an alltime high of 841.47 .

The greatest upward momentum was provided by American Telephone &; Telegraph , whose shares have moved from 691 to 741 since they were split a fortnight ago . Chrysler and General Motors have also been front runners , helped by last week 's report that U.S. automakers built 13% more cars in June than in the same month last year . All those cars sent up demand for gas and oil , buoying the shares of Texaco , Jersey Standard and California Standard . The other significant gainers in the Dow-Jones have been Du Pont , International Harvester and Sears , Roebuck-the latter lifted by the upswing in retail sales since the tax cut . <P> <P> The rise in consumer spending has also given new luster to grocery chains , department store groups and clothing producers .
