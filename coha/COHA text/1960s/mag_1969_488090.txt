This summer at a meeting of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors , the head of the city 's Police Officers Association ( POA ) silently handed a booklet to each supervisor . It was titled The Black Book . In its introduction Jake W. Ehrlich , chief counsel for the POA , charged that a rival black association , the Officers for Justice ( OFJ ) , was racist and contributing to the " destruction of law and order . " The 18 pages of " documentation " in the booklet would prove his charge , Ehrlich said . The occasion for The Black Book was a referendum which the OFJ had submitted to the Board of Supervisors , and which the board had placed on the fall ballot . If approved it will grant time and a half for overtime and a night differential to all policemen and firemen , elevate the Police Community Relations Unit ( PCR ) to a bureau ( on an organizational par with , say , Missing Persons or Homicide ) , promote the head of the new bureau to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The referendum thus would increase the wages of every policeman and fireman in the city ( who are already the highest paid in the nation ) , while at the same time it strengthened the department 's efforts to reach the disenfranchised . The final two sections of the referendum  --  the elevation of the PCR and the restructuring of police promotions  --  have been tried and found successful in other large cities . Yet , several days after the referendum was put on the ballot , Ehrlich announced the POA 's " unalterable opposition . " The proposal , he said , was a " political hoax " and would cost the city too much money . Neither charge makes sense . The intent of the referendum is direct and simple ; there is little room for hoax . And though the proposal would certainly cost the city money , the supervisors unanimously agreed that it would be well spent , as a boost to both a new recruiting drive and to the morale of the existing force . On the surface , the POA 's opposition makes as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hike at General Motors . However , fitted into the racism of the San Francisco Police Department , and especially of the POA leadership , it makes too much sense . Of all the nascent black police officer associations across the country , San Francisco 's Officers for Justice is probably the most militant and certainly the most political . By sponsoring the referendum , the OFJ has made a play for a wide base of support and , simultaneously , caught the POA with its apathy showing . Even though similar proposals had been suggested by civic leaders , the POA never bothered to submit a referendum addressed to the critical needs of the next few years . So the Officers for Justice stole the initiative . The leaders of 3 . AsI the older , white association reacted as expected , even though by doing so they worked against the welfare of every policeman on the force . When asked what the OFJ planned to do with the POA 's refusal to support the referendum , one of the black leaders said simply , " We 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was organized in early 1969 after a group of black officers , charged with an off-duty offense , was refused legal aid by the POA . The POA claimed it did not have the authority to defend off-duty charges . Yet several months later it threw its influence , and the services of Ehrlich himself , behind Michael O'Brien , a white policeman who was accused of having shot and killed a black man while off duty . O'Brien was acquitted . By the end of O'Brien 's trial , the OFJ was functioning . The nucleus of the association was a group in the Community Relations Unit that had worked for years  --  sometimes openly and sometimes covertly  --  against the POA . In January 1969 , after Mayor Joseph Alioto 's Tactical Squad had clubbed and arrested hundreds at San Francisco State College over a three-month period , three members of the OFJ held a press conference on the campus . Advising students and faculty to carry cameras and note pads to document any questionable police behavior , they promised to bring such information before the complaint department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced : " We deplore ? the carnival glee of police departments within a hundred miles of San Francisco who now beg to have their policemen permitted to get ' riot training ' experience on the heads of SF State students . " The reaction was prompt . Word drifted down from the Mayor 's office that two of the most outspoken officers at the press conference ? Palmer Jackson and Richard Hongisto  --  were to be transferred out of the PCR on the charge of " un-officerlike conduct . " " So I picked up the phone , " Hongisto remembers , " and called the Mayor 's office and let them know that they were fools if they thought the Mayor and the POA could rip us out just like they would have fifteen years ago . " Instead of retreating into a defense of their first press conference , the group attacked . Jackson explained : " We knew that our strength was in the community , not in the police department . So we did n't play politics with Alioto and the POA . We went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was inevitable that the Police Officers Association would pressure Alioto to move against Jackson and Hongisto . Most of the recent prosecution of white San Francisco cops for maiming and killing citizens has come out of the efforts of the Community Relations Unit . Both Jackson and Hongisto , ' along with others , have spent off-duty hours helping to gather evidence ' against cops who have ' abused the badge and the gun . ' " For several weeks the OFJ kept it up . They released THE NATION/ October 13 , 1969 figures showing that only 4.5 per cent of the Police Department was black ( the figure still holds ) , and that of those , three were assistant inspectors ( detectives ) , one a sergeant , and none was higher . " In silence , gentlemen , in silence , we have carried the double burden of Black officers and Black men , " another statement read . " What redress do we have when confronted with the spectacle of Black brothers and sisters being mistreated ? The days of fronting the grinning darky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days later , Jackson and Hongisto learned that the charges had been dropped . But as Rodney Williams , head of the Community Relations Unit and a member of the OFJ , pointed out , racism is not the only issue the OFJ faces . " Remember , the name of the organization is the Officers for Justice , not the Afro-American Police Officers Association or something like that . More than anything , we want a police department that is honest , professional and compassionate . " Because of the OFJ 's emphasis on professionalism , the POA has become an increasingly vulnerable target . The stagnation  --  if not the incompetence  --  of Harry Bell and John Lahane , leaders of the POA , is plain to all young officers , whether black or white . Elective positions within the police association are almost always filled as the result of friendship cliques that take many years to develop , and the leaders have seen to it that police promotions lean heavily toward senior members of the force . The present weight given seniority on promotion examinations is three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 . W. Wilson , dean of the University of California 's School of Criminology , in his Municipal Police Administration Young whites , as well as blacks , are excluded from advancement commensurate with their ability , and the police administration is filled with veterans whose police mentality was formed in the 1940s . But perhaps nothing makes cynics of young officers more quickly than the equanimity with which police crime is regarded by the POA . A young white officer , discussing with me the seniority system , casually added : " And , of course , it was a long time before the old officers accepted me enough to steal in front of me . " Shocked by his nonchalance , I asked him to describe how officers steal . " Well , I do n't know about other cities , but in San Francisco it 's mostly done in patrol cars . Two officers will break into a store that 's in their patrol area . They take the loot out , put it in the trunk , dnve to a private oar and transfer the stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a burglary report . " Almost nothing is done about such theft , for several reasons . First , Thomas Cahill , the police chief , will retire soon and wants , above everything to avoid a riot in his city or a scandal in his department . Then , everyone who knows of the crime usually gets a cut . Finally , the POA at least tacitly accepts police theft as a police fringe benefit . In the same offhand way , , the young officer added : " Right now there 's an organized burglary ring operating out of the Hall of Justice . About nine guys are involved , THE NATIoN'October 13. 1969 I think , and I 've heard they 're selling color TV sets for $50 apiece in the basement . Cahill is trying to cover it up before the press gets hold of it . " The story was so fantastic that I dismissed it as rumor , but the next day the San Francisco Chronicle ran a front-page article headlined , " SF Probe of Alleged Cop Theft Ring . " The Chronicle said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumor " that a burglary ring was operating out of the Hall of Justice . When I phoned the young officer , ' he commented : " Did you notice that Cahill assigned the three dumbest captains on the whole force to investigate ? " It is noted with irony in the department that Community Relations , the unit that has received least support from Cahill and the POA , has become nationally famous for its professionalism and work with the city 's minority groups . Dante Andreotti , whose leadership helped create the reputation of the unit , left the department when Cahill persistently refused to support the work of the PCR . See " The Friendly Fuzz " by Alvin A. Rosenfeld , The Nation , April 21 . After Andreotti 's departure , a series of white administrators failed to win the support of the men in the unit or the communities they served . Though deprived of effective leadership , these men have maintained their alliances with the city 's minorities . In June , working with the OFJ ( many officers were members of both groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first black officer to head the PCR . Williams has been a member of the OFJ since its beginning . This appointment was a signal to the POA that the black movement had come of age in the San Francisco Police Department . Racism in the department has moved a long way from the rubber hose in a back room , but its present sophistication does not mean its disappearance . It does mean that those who would fight racism have a much harder time finding their targets . Hongisto , the only white member of , the OFJ , explained : " It 's the way the white guys look at the black guys , like they know why the black guys are there . It 's where you get assigned and who 'll help you if you get in trouble . It 's just a reflection of the way the outside works , only worse . " The size of membership is a problem for the OFJ . There are only eighty black officers in the whole department , and if every one of them is a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) the group is still numerically very weak . The POA has more than 1,700 members . Judging the relative strength by membership is deceptive in this instance . The apathy of the POA reduces its strength . Fewer than 100 officers came to the September 16 meeting , when the POA decided to oppose the referendum . Conversely , an OFJ member must be active almost by definition . Nevertheless , the Officers for Justice must attract a membership that is not based on race alone if it hopes to erode the POA 's hold on police politics . The proposed referendum may help . Palmer Jackson , vice president of the OFJ , has pointed out that the real strength of the OFJ comes from community support , not from department politics , and the referendum perfectly fits that situation . The POA must now present its case to 369 the public , and there the black association has already proved itself more adept . The POA must also try to neutralize the support which the referendum is receiving from a unanimous Board of Supervisors , the Mayor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps most important , the rank and file of policemen and firemen who are naturally inclined to back a measure that will increase their pay checks . If the referendum does pass , it will not signal that the battle has been won but only that it has begun The POA 's revenues and traditional influence guarantee that it will continue for many years to represent most police officers in the city The Officers for Justice do not expect that they will severely eclipse that influence Although they will accept any police officer as a member , no white policeman  --  except Hongisto , who was one of the founders  --  has applied . The OFJ does hope that by winning the referendum it will gain a position strong enough to alter ' the policy and performance of the police Rodney Williams was explicit : " For instance , a black kid was shot a month ago after he jumped out of a stolen car There was no reasonable excuse for the shooting , but it often happens ? some kid goes joy-riding , gets scared when the cops chase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and usually he 's black Now , why could n't Cahill order that car theft suspects not be fired on " If there was a black deputy chief , or even one who cared about blacks , then a no-shoot order could be suggested at the highest level . As it is , all we can do is sit and hope " If the POA has its way , that is all that men like Wilhams will ever do . Chief counsel Ehrlich will not say how he plans to defeat the referendum ( " As general , I ca n't commit my troops until all the facts are in George Washington and Napoleon learned that " ) , but the POA can afford to spend many thousands of dollars on the campaign . Sitting in his office , festooned with intertwining Amerioan and Confederate flags , Ehrlich denied that racism was behind the POA 's intent But when questioned about some of the charges of the Officers for Justice , Ehrlich motioned to Harry Bell , head of the POA . " Get him The Black Book . " Bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Here , this 'll show you who the real racists are " San Francisco , for all its renown as a progressive city , has yet to support real reform in its Police and Fire Departments ; and Mayor Alioto , who is reading the conservative winds in politics very carefully , may not push the referendum . Within the Police Department the bitterness is growing " It 's as if the department woke up one day this year and found out the world was coming apart along a black and white seam , " remarked a member of the OFJ , " and the department was going with it Only it was happening faster here because it had to catch up . And no one can say that things have improved , but neither can they say things will ever he the same " More than anything , the POA feat s change Harry Bell and Jake Ehrlich know that their association will last out this test , but they are old men clinging to ideas and attitudes whose time has passed Whether or not the POA wins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight , and that another is coming soon .
