txt The Air Force lifted its three-week-old ban on F-111 plane flights yesterday . But it also announced that the critical internal structure about which its movable wings pivot would be reinforced , and that flights would meantime be restricted . The apparent effect was to limit flights to subsonic speeds and relatively mild maneuvers , and to delay further the return to Vietnam combat of the five ** in Thailand . The announcement sought to minimize the structural problem , which turned up when a sample of the internal fitting developed a major crack during a ground test in August . It said that extensive inspection of F-111 's had found no similar ' defects . However , the Air Force : acknowledged that it would he ' mid-February before new , planes , with the remedy incorporated , would be off the production line and delivered to Air Force units . The swing-wing planes had been put under similiar flight restrictions once before , in the wake of the August groundtest incident . The total ban on flights came Sept. 24 , following a crash in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A similar total ban had been imposed briefly last spring after a series of crashes , in the war zone and in this country . In ending the latest ban , the Air Force said the crash that had precipitated it had been caused by crew oversights and not by any structural failure . Production Halt Urged Senator Stuart Symington , when informed of the plane 's return to restricted flying status , called for holding up any further F-111 production until the restrictions were removed . " Any other course can only result in further losses to the taxpayers , " the Missouri Democrat said . It was learned meantime that a new struggle had been building within the Defense Department over how many F-111 's should be built in all . The arguments were reported related primarily to the long-rising costs of the plane rather than to the technical troubles that have contributed to the cost increases . Reliable sources said Pentagon civilians whose job it is to compare cost effectiveness of competing weapons systems had recommended another big cut in planned F-111 production . Called Too Expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $7-millionplus each , the swing-wing plane was much too expensive for many of the missions it was intended for . Other cheaper planes could take over such tasks , the analysts suggested . The recommendation was said to be under severe ' counterattack from the Air Force . Yesterday 's announcement , lifting the ban on flights and minimizing what has been considered the most serious technical problem , was apparently intended to buttress the Air Force case . The F-Il I 's prime innovation is its use of swing wings , which are extended out to the sides for slow-speed take-off and landing , and pivot far back for supersonic flight . There are almost 100 in service , and the multibillion-dollar program has called for 500 or more in addition . No combat missions have been flown since the first rlight ban was imposed May 9 . The accident that immediately preceded the just-ended flight ban occurred Sept. 23 at . Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas , Nev . The plane was just a mile from a landing touchdown when it went into a " slow pull-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control , escaped in the plane 's ejection capsule . Center of Gravity Shifted The Air Force announcement said the pull-up had resulted from an excessive rearward shift of the plane 's center of gravity . The shift had to do with the transfer of jet fuel ? an operation to which the crew had given " inadequate attention . " As for the cracked belly fitting that had led to flight restrictions , the announcement said the failure " was due to an isolated small crack induced during the manufacturing process in the metal surrounding a bolt hole . " The plane is built by the General Dynamics Corporation . The Air Force said no similar imperfection had been found during inspection of more than 2,500 other bolt holes . " Reinforcement of the highstress areas of the wing box will be accomplished on all aircraft in order to spread the load more evenly , " the announcement added . " As a precautionary measure , the Air Force is retaining the present temporary flight-loading limitations pending this reinforcement . " No final design of the reinforcement renewal has yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planes , both those in service and those on the Fort Worth production line , can not be done quickly . The Air Force said it ' would be mid-February before new planes off the line could ibe delivered to operational squadrons .
