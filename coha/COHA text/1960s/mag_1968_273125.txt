This latest arrival from the Czech cinematic surge is both sad and slapstick in an old-fashioned way . It is a Chaplinesque morality play about simple innocence in the rapacious world , aptly matched with direction and photography that point up the pastiche without collapsing into camp . <P> The Tarzan of the title is Baron Wolfgang von Hoppe ( Rudolf Hrusnsky ) , whose parents take him to the African jungle around the turn of the century to escape the sinks of civilization . Vati and Mutti promptly perish , of course , and little Wolfgang grows up among the apes . Captured by hunters some time in the ' 30s , he returns to the family Schloss , where the estate is being run by his rascally cousin Heinrich ( Martin Ruzek ) . Heinrich hires an English governess called Regina ( Jana Stepankov ) to give the ape-baron enough training to convince a commission that he is competent to take over his rightful inheritance . On the sly , he offers her a handsome reward to fail ; Regina , though , does her perfidious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> In the process , she imbues him with the ideals of human brotherhood , and the result is a new version of the Noble Savage showing up the hypocrisy of Civilized Man ( as in Voltaire 's L'Ingnu ) . The disillusioned baron ends up in a circus , where he is displayed as Tarzan the ape man . <P> The essence of the film , though , is not in the comic-strip chiaroscuro of its plot but in the fun Director Jaroslav Balk and his cast have with their caricatures . Rudolf Hrusnsky turns in a burly , brachycephalic performance as the ape man , first delighted by the apparent selflessness of humans-who do not fight for food at a reception and talk constantly of altruism-then horrified at the superjungle that gives the lie to their platitudes . " People , what are you doing ? " he cries as the assorted forces of evil tangle in , around , up , down and through his baroque baronial halls . And in a delicious caricature of a caricature , Balk decks out his English and German villains in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western heads .
