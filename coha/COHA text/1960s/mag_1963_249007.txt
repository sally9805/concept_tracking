Cantankerous Clyfford Still lives like a hermit , has no dealer , rarely lets anyone buy his work without his personal approval , and as much as possible forbids exhibiting his work in group shows . Now , drawn by the chance to show at the University of Pennsylvania 's Institute of Contemporary Art , where he has found a congenial teaching task , Still is exhibiting 32 major oils rarely seen before . They show that at 58 he ranks among the few skilled practitioners of abstract expressionism . <P> Picked from a quarter century of his production , the paintings comprise Still 's life statement , which is roughly that of the DO N'T TREAD ON ME FLAG . He has apparently found personal liberty-at the expense of being at odds with the outside world . " I 'm not interested in illustrating my time , " he says . " Our age is one of science , of mechanism , of power and death . I see no point in adding to its mammoth arrogance the compliment of graphic homage . " <P> Cubism 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , got an M.A. from Washington State University . During World War II he drew blueprints ; afterward , with Mark Rothko , he drew disciples to the avant-garde California School of Fine Arts , teaching the first serious alternative to cubism in recent art history . <P> Not until he was 41 did Still have a one-man show . And only a few years later , unlike his close friend Jackson Pollock , he withdrew from what artists not so affectionately call " the arena , " or marketplace , to a small farm near Baltimore . His living room is floored with linoleum , and an aging DeSoto is parked in front of his garage . Inside is his one known materialist obsession-a lovingly polished vintage Jaguar touring car . <P> In the late 1930s , Still was given to Freudian imagery-cyclopean-eyed totems and phallic horns . Suddenly in his 1943-A ( see opposite page ) , all signs , symbols and literary allusions vanished . Still laid tubes of red and yellow against his surface and squeezed out streaks of lightning . Then he began slathering ever larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slabs of paint laid on almost as thick as bas-relief . <P> Sooty Icing . " To be stopped by a frame 's edge was intolerable , " says Still in characteristically irascible terms . " A Euclidean prison had to be annihilated . " He does not frame his canvases because they do not end where his paint does . Some of his best adventures in paint occur close to the edges , where colorful jigsaw puzzle pieces are chopped off as if they had turned the corner into a new dimension . Other oils seem to spread relentlessly outward and upward like aerial photography of an erupting volcanic landscape . <P> More than any of his contemporaries , Still believes art is an exertion of man 's freedom against a hostile world , a machete in the jungle . Such a tool is his latest work shown , 1963-A , bristling with black fury like a thunderhead . It is swathed onto raw canvas with his palette knife like sooty icing , with only flecks of lavender and blue to serve a lighter side . It is also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Painting must be an extension of the man , of his blood , a confrontation with himself . Only thus can a valid instrument of individual freedom be created .
