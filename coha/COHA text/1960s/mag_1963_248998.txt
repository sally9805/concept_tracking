The jittery , harmless-looking little man in steel-rimmed spectacles was accused of murder , and he had long since confessed . Now , after four days of testimony and five hours of deliberation , the jurors had reached a verdict . They found the defendant , Howard Pierson , 49 , not guilty by reason of insanity . <P> Thus last week in Austin , Texas , ended a murder trial that had been delayed for 28 years while the State of Texas waited , with inexhaustible patience , for Howard Pierson to recover his reason . <P> Pierson 's belated acquittal was likely to contribute to a legal controversy that has raged for more than a century : What to do with the criminal who is not mentally responsible for his crime ? Pierson had shot his father and mother one April night in 1935 and , after briefly protesting his innocence , he admitted the murders and his motive . His parents , he said , stood in the way of his plan to save mankind by means of a " cosmic-ray microscope " of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In dispensing justice in such cases , the law generally relies on a time-tested decision . In England in 1843 , a Scotsman named Daniel M'Naghten , fancying some grievance against England 's Prime Minister , Sir Robert Peel , shot and killed the Prime Minister 's secretary by mistake . Fifteen British magistrates agreed that M'Naghten did not understand the " nature and quality " of his act-in short , could not tell right from wrong while committing the crime-and was therefore insane . Instead of going to the gallows , the daft Scot went to an asylum . <P> The M'Naghten Rule , as applied to the criminally insane , has guided the hand of justice ever since . But in increasing number , lawyers and judges are wondering whether justice needs a better guide . Says Psychiatrist Bernard L. Diamond , a member of a commission appointed by California Governor Pat Brown to study the state 's criminal insanity laws : " A person who is so mentally ill that he does n't understand right from wrong would be a drooling idiot incapable of action . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's understanding of mental illness to such a degree that the M'Naghten Rule 's oversimplified definition of insanity is scarcely any definition at all . <P> An enlightened age has set about redefining insanity for legal purposes , and can claim modest progress . In 1954 , a Washington , D.C. , killer named Monte Durham was declared not guilty , not because he could not distinguish right from wrong , but on the larger ground that a criminal should not be held cul pable if " his unlawful act is the product of a mental disease or defect . " The so-called Durham Rule , or something like it , has since entered the law of several states ( Maine , Vermont and Illinois ) . By necessity , such progress takes place at a deliberate pace , as the law weighs the possibility that any change in the criminal insanity codes may open inviting new escape hatches for the dedicated law breaker .
