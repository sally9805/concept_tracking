txt Mayor Wagner announced yesterday that the city would carry out a new and massive program to rid the slums of rats . He disclosed that the Board of Estimate had informally approved a$1 million extermination plan for the first year of the program . The drive , which is expected to move into full swing in March , will be carried on primarily by the Health Department . The department will hire 148 additional employes , most of them exterminators and inspectors . The owners of buildings will be required to pay for the work . The program will be coupled with an intensive tenant-educaH tion campaign to clean up ratinfested neighborhoods . The primary target , the Mayor said , will be about 6,000 rat-infested buildings whose owners have either been difficult to find or have done nothing about the rats . The buildings have about 100,000 families . Health Is Stressed Because of the failure of the landlords to act , Mr. Wagner said , " The city must , for the sake of the health of the people concerned , move into the breach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet an old problem , " the Mayor explained . " We have no Pied Piper to whistle a magic tune to lure all the rats out of New York . However , we are going to do our best , even at great cost , to diminish the ugly menace of rats in the neighborhoods which they infest most heavily and do the most harm . " The Mayor said it was expected that the cost of the program would be shared by the state under the usual arrangement whereby city health projects receive state aid on a 50.50 basis . The neighborhoods that the rat-control drive will focus on include Harlem , East Harlem and the Lower East Side in Manhattan ; the Bedford-Stuyvesant and Brownsville districts of Brooklyn , the Mott Haven area in the Bronx , and the South Jamaica , Corona and Long Island City areas in Queens . Many observers felt that a good deal of the impetus for the Mayor 's program came from the , publicity given to the rent strikes that have recently . spread through slum areas , par-I ticularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,000 tenants in 168 buildings have decided to withhold their rent until their landlords correct violations . Rat , infestation is high on the list of violations . Another major reason for the extermination drive is that the ' Health Department has been making no headway on reducing the number of rat-bite cases in the city each year . About 700 persons , many of them infants , were bitten last year . None of the bites proved fatal . The Health Department operation will be directed by Jerome B. Trichter , Assistant Commis ' sioner in charge of environ- , mental sanitation . Mr. Trichter said his special , exterminating staff would attack the rat problem in the following manner : cTwenty teams of five exterminators and one supervising inspector will be sent into the trouble areas , one team to a block . They will be provided with chemicals and rat-baiting equipment . Each building will be checked to determine whether it is rat-infested and , if so , where the bait can be most effectively placed . The bait-40 parts corn meal and cottonseed oil to one part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dish of water near by . The reason for the water is the affinity of rats for damp places . The poison involves no danger to humans or pets when properly ? used because it would have to be eaten as a regular diet to cause illness . The adults in each building will be informed about the bait locations , and barricades will be i placed around the poisoned feed ) trays to keep children away ! from them . Infested buildings will generally be baited three times in the first month and once a month after that . Mr. Trichter said that the rat poison had been in use in many parts of the country for years and was considered by public health officials to be the safest and most effective poison for use in buildings . In addition to the exterminating squads , the assistant commissioner said , there will be four top supervisors , 10 truck drivers and 10 clerical employes . Owners to Pay for Work Dr. George James , the Health Commissioner , explained that the exterminating program was " not a free service for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual rat extermination work in a building , " he said , " the owner will be charged with the , cost of that work . And , of course , - we will prosecute the owner of every building where we are forced to take action . " Dr. : lames also stressed that the poisoning alone would not wipe out the rats and that a massive clean-up campaign by tenants would be crucial . Under the new plan , four additional community workers will be hired by the Health DeI partment to enlist neighborhood I support . The extermination program was informally approved ThursI day at an executive session of 1 the Board of Estimate . Final approval of the $1 million appropriation by the board and the City Council , which is con ; sidered a formality , is expected by Feb. 1 . Mr. Trichter said he hoped to be able to start buying the trucks , chemicals and other I equipment by the first week of February .                    @
