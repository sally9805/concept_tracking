Tokyo 's besieged commuters daily battle what they call kotsu jigoku - literally , traffic hell - but they are about to get welcome relief from at least one of its irritations . At a particularly nasty intersection , where queues of buses now snarl traffic , a group of entrepreneurs plans to build the city 's first indoor bus terminal . The moving force behind the new , $25 million station is a man who has a special interest in the comfort of Japanese bus riders : Kenji Osano , a burly , self-made millionaire who owns most of the buses that will use the new terminal . Last week , with his eye on lengthier travel as well , Osano asked the Japanese government for permission to start a bus line from Tokyo to a moun tain resort 140 miles away ; he hopes that it will be the first link in a Greyhound-like system for Japan . <P> Wartime Profits . Osano 's ambitious ventures in travel and tourism have made him , at 47 , one of Japan 's most remarkable postwar millionaires . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose sales last year rose to $61 million . Among other things , the firm owns and operates Japan 's biggest bus and taxi fleets , seven Japanese hotels and a string of driving schools , travel agencies and sporting-goods shops . It is also Japan 's largest distributor of Chrysler Corp . autos and its sole distributor of International Harvester farm and construction equipment . As if all this were not enough , Osano last year bought three of the Sheraton Corp . ' s Hawaiian hotels ( the SurfRider , Moana , and Princess Kaiulani ) , thus becoming the largest individual Japanese investor in the U.S. He figures that , after the Japanese government this month lifts its postwar ban on foreign pleasure travel , the travel-loving Japanese will head " like a flood tide " for Hawaii , which , says Osano , " is far enough away for them to forget their worries , but not so far that they will get homesick . " <P> A farmer 's son with only a sixth-grade education , Osano has shown an uncanny ability to foresee and exploit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army before Pearl Harbor , he piled up a fortune by supplying spare auto parts to the Imperial Navy . At war 's end , expecting an eventual travel boom , he used his profits to start buying hotels , also began acquiring bus and taxi companies . After the Korean war , as prospering Japanese businessmen began buying more foreign goods , he started importing U.S. autos and golf clubs . As sole owner of his many-sided business empire , Osano has amassed a personal fortune of about $140 million .
