We were awakened shortly after sunrise one Sunday morn  --  ing by a woman 's voice imitating a top sergeant over a public-address system . The amplifier was turned up to such volume that the sound seemed to come from all directions . The air was full of it , It could have been heard a mile away . Such a noise blasting into our sleep might have been alarm  --  ing if it had not been so easy to guess the source : on the night before two cabin cruisers had tied up 100 yards or so downriver from our house , and this was their method of waking up . That morning it had to be our method too . The P.A. system continued at full volume for maybe two hours : first the woman 's strident sergeant imitation , waking up her fellow boatmen , and then radio music . Finally I went down to where the boats were tied and asked that the speaker be turned down , and was told by one of the boat  --  men : " We did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repeat all that was said , but the boat  --  man made one other remark that surprised me . When I insisted that he had no right to create such a disturbance , he said : " We 're on the river , you know . " I came home shortly after dark one night to see the light of a campfire on the shore of the river below the house , and when I stopped my car I could hear rock'n'roll coming up from a radio . Several men , their boats moored at the shore , were sitting around the fire , drinking and talk  --  ing , their conversation enclosed in music there as it would have been in a bar . I told them they were welcome , and asked only that they carry off their bottles and other garbage . ) One of the men replied : " Why , we're-boatmen , " His tone implied that my request was so unnecessary as to be insulting  --  that boatmen were not only respectful of the river but , as a group , especially respectful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boats were gone , and the rocks were strewn with bottles and with plastic and paper trash . The place had hardly been used , much less THE NATION / October 17 , 1966 respected ? it had been perched upon , befouled , ignored . Our house stands on a slope overlooking the Ken  --  tucky River a few miles from its entrance into the Ohio at Carrollton . It has been a long time since this was a " natural river . " A system of navigation locks and dams was built in the last century , and the land of the bottoms has been as intensively farmed as any in Kentucky . Yet , for those who know where and how to look , the valley still has a rich natural life . In the summers we see wood duCks and musk  --  rats raising their young along the banks . The great blue heron fishes here . In the woods on the bluffs and around the sloughs there are still enough big trees for pileated woodpeckers to make a living . At night we often hear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fox . Occasionally we see deer . And beavers have begun to appear again on the banks of the river and its bigger tribu  --  taries where they were exterminated long before anybody now living can remember . Here and there on the wooded slopes of the valley are tall open groves of a solemn beauty that keep , as if in a profound interior withheld from the ceaseless drone of en  --  gines , a fragment of the great quietness that two centuries ago lay upon ' the whole valley . The delicate flowers and mosses and ferns and the colorful mushrooms of the woods grow there . The voice of those places is that of the wood thrush , whose notes , without replacing the quiet , flow into it from some hidden perch  --  and . into the hearing of who  --  ever may be there , to attach itself like a clarifying emblem on the memory . In rainy times the streams step noisily and brilliantly down the rocky notches . If one can respond to the quiet of those places with quiet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its lives : squirrels and chipmunks leading the eyes into unsuspected places among the treetops and among roots and rocks and fallen logs on the ground ; vireos and warblers singing and feeding in the dense foliage ; water thrushes searching the edges of rocky pools . Knowing this valley , once one has started to know it , is clearly no casual matter . Like all country places , it is both complex and reticent . It can not be understood by passing through . It does not , like Old Faithful , gush up its inwards 384. on schedule so as not to delay the hurrying traveler . Its wonders are commonplace and shy . Knowing them is an endless labor and , if one can willingly expend the labor , an endless pleasure . I am not sure how one would judge a valley or compare it.to any other . I guess that this one must be as attractive as most To me , because I have been its inhabitant and intimate , it is the most attractive of all . I know that among all the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich hours and days and lives for people I have known this valley all my life From the first it has been a source of pleasure to me , an object of interest and curiosity , an attraction . Every day / am here I learn more about it , and the more I learn the more clearly I see that my knowledge of it is one of its fragments The one part of its history that / have known from the beginning is the pleasure-boat era . Since the end of World War II motorboats have increased from rarity to such preva  --  lence that on summer holidays and weekends the traffic is comparable to that on a highway . There are days when the river will not grow quiet from the wake of one boat before it is disturbed again by the passing of another , and these boats frequently travel in groups of a dozen or two . The episodes that begin these notes are not typical of the behavior of vacationers on this river . But I think that they are symptomatic , and that they clarify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am disturbed by what I think those meanings are . The generalization that the activities of the boatmen tend to support is that , in relation to the natural world , the pleasure of Americans can be destructive in the same way that their work has already proved to be . It is not , certainly , a conscious destructiveness . But in that very unconscious  --  ness it becomes an aspect of one of our worst national failings : our refusal to admit the need to be conscious Or to put it more meaningfully : our refusal to admit that un  --  consciousness , in our time , is almost inevitably destructive . The destructiveness of the boatmen is of a peculiarly modern kind . It is essentially the same as the destructive  --  ness of certain industries , and it has the same causes . the use of powerful machines , and the discarding of more or less imperishable refuse . The destructiveness of the boat  --  men differs from that of industry mainly in the sad para  --  dox that the boatmen destroy what they supposedly want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage anything . They have come to enjoy the river  --  and their enjoyment of it damages it . They do not use it as a fisherman uses it , leaving it as it was . they use it as clothing is used , leaving it always a little worse for the wear . They are the consumers of the river The aspect of this destructiveness that has attracted most attention , and has finally become the object of a state law , is the dumping of trash into the water Of all the boating offenses this is certainly the most noticeable , and in many ways it is the most disgusting An amount of trash that would be a relatively minor eyesore on a highway will deface the river for miles , carried and dispersed on the currents . One Fourth of July , while we ate a picnic on the river bank , we watched a procession of bottles and cans and wadded papers from a lunch being served on a boat a few hundred yards up the shore . That sort of thing can give the open country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the refuse that gets into the river is , of course , thrown in from the shores , and washed out of dumps by high water . But there is some that is just as certainly at  --  tributable to the boatmen . I have seen , for instance , whole table settings of paper and plastic dishes floating along to  --  gether . There is another concern which ? because it has ap  --  parently received no attention , and because I am not a scientist ? I can express only as a question : What effect is the turbulence of all this traffic having on the banks of the river9 Of a wide riser with gently sloping low banks this question would probably not need to be asked . But the Kentucky is narrow as navigable rivers go , its banks are high and extremely steep , and they are often composed largely of sand Along such banks there will naturally be a continuous wearing by the current , but I think there is reason to suspect that this natural erosion is now being hastened by the wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike with great force , leaving the water muddy , and the wetted banks more vulnerable to the wake of the next boat Some of the wearing in the banks seems clearly to have been caused by the lateral action of the waves rather than the longitudinal flowing of the current . And there is some crumbling to be seen along the banks in times of low water , when there is no current but a heavy traffic of boats Officials in Frankfort have told me that no consideration is being given to this problem . In view of the likelihood that the number of pleasure boats will increase steadily for a long time , it seems to me that some consideration should be given to it This worry is hardly a part of the boatman s experience . Speeding along , he has before him a tranquil river scene , peaceful and enticing as if pictured in a tourist brochure . When the shores begin to churn and the water to cloud with mud from the violence of his passing , he is not there But not only are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it There is no such thing , apparently , as a slow pleasure boat Even the large , awk  --  wardly shaped houseboats are customarily equipped with powerful engines that send them along at cruiser speeds . When these boats take to the river in weekend numbers the pleasure of motorboating becomes the only possible pleasure . The use of a rowboat is possible , but hardly pleasant ; canoeing can even be dangerous . Fishing , from a boat tossing and beating in the turbulence a cabin cruiser can stir up in a narrow stream , is simply impossible . Out on the river in a canoe or rowboat , it would be dangerous to act on the assumption that any approaching motorboat will do the common courtesy of slowing down . It is rare that one will do it . And even courtesy is curiously thwarted by the fact that the violence of the wake of some boats increases as they slow down From the confluence of its headwater streams at Beatty  --  ville to its mouth at Carrollton , the Kentucky River is 255 miles long . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of canoes and rowboats and fishermen and swimmers , who could share it quietly and in some isolation from one another ? the quiet and the isola  --  tion being , I assume , the reasons one would go to a river instead of an amusement park . But a hundred or less of these fast motorboats , evenly distributed over the length of so narrow a river , will produce the effect of crowded  --  ness , fill it with noise , and substantially reduce the pleasure and the safety of everybody else . But suppose that the river is used not by a hundred of these boats but by several hundred , as it is on summer weekends and holidays . Suppose that some of these boats are broadcasting music or talk over amplifiers , as some do . Suppose some of them carry on their decks men and boys pot shooting with rifles , as they frequently do . It will be seen then , I think , what a disproportionate share of the good of the river is taken by them . It is not that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more troubling to reflect that they take it automatically , thoughtlessly , simply because they go fast and make so much commotion . There is another destructiveness involved in this sport that is less easy to understand , but Which once explained may help to explain the rest . ' The use of these fast and powerful boats is not only destructive of the river and of the pleasure of other people ; there is a sense , it seems to me , in which it is destructive of the pleasure of the boat  --  men themselves . I know that if one of these men were asked to justify his sport he would certainly say that there is pleasure in the ownership and use of a fine boat , and that there is a pleasure , in speed . I would agree . Some of those boats are indeed beautifully made ; I understand the satisfaction there would be in the maintenance and use of one . And I also am a creature of the time and know the pleasure of going fast . But then another question is suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pleasures sought , then why should these people not be content to go round and round or up and down on a 10-mile ' course near their dock ? Why should boatmen from Cincinnati and Louisville , who havethe wide Ohio ' to maneuver on , come to a comparatively remote stream like the Kentucky that is narrower , crookeder and more difficult ? The only answer I can think of involves another pathetic paradox . They come in search of peace and quiet , solitude ; some restorative contact with the natural world . Which is a little like going in search of a forest with a logging crew . Once they get it , they no longer have it . They come to seek the stillness of a natural place , and their way of seeking assures the failure of their search . They seek relief from restlessness and anxiety in these expensive , fast , super  --  horsepowered boats , which are embodiments of restless  --  ness and anxiety. , They go toward their desire with such violence of haste that they can never arrive . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there the noise , haste , confusion ? and , surely , the frustration ? of city traffic . The boatman 's Pursuit of pleasure is determined and liinited not by his and his family 's need but by the size and speed of his boat , and so he takes far more than he needs . It may be that he actually gets less pleasure because of taking so much . And the excess of his ' pleasure , useless to him , is useless to everybody eIse . Because he takes too much , he creates the possibility that others will have too little . The boatman , then , has become what more and more seems the ideal man of our society : a super-consumer ? which is to say , a waster , a ruiner , a benefit to " the econ  --  omy , " a burden to the world . The mentality that could support delusions so damaging to itself is strange to the world , alien to creation . It is ' like a dog that , chasing its own tail , catches it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of madness and a kind of unconsciousness , so impenetrable by reason that I could not articulate the questions it raises , much less find answers , until I began to reflect on the two statements of the boatman quoted in the first of these notes . We did n't know anybody lived around here . They had come , one must suppose , in answer to the summons , still much alive in America , that brought some men to the frontier the attraction of a wild uninhabited place And the high wooded banks of this river had permitted an illu  --  sion that would have been dissipated by a glance at a road map , or even a moment 's thought All of Kentucky is inhabited now The settlements have grown here for nearly 200 years The wild country is gone , along with the Indians and the buffalo and the wolves and the elk and the passenger pigeons and the parakeets and nearly all the old forests and much of the fertility of the land Kentucky is inhabited all right , and for the most part the inhabitants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon would be . We 're on the river , you know . He meant , of course . that he was in a public place , not my place , and so I had no right to complain But I think he meant more than that A wild , uninhabited place , such as he wanted to believe he had come to , is by the definition of our frontier experience a free place . One has no bosses there , one is free of responsi  --  bility and can do purely according to pleasure . How illusory that is is proved by the fact that the country is inhabited and that some of the inhabitants objected to anyone 's be  --  having as if it were not How illusory it is , and how danger  --  ous , is proved by American history . those pioneer forebears of ours , so attractively free of responsibility , not only set  --  tled the country but used up the fertility and wealth and beauty of it at a rate that made their lives a disgrace to them and a burden to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act on the presumption that they are alone . And we are seeing with greater clarity and greater sorrow every day that the most solitary have had neighbors , and that the loneliest have had heirs . What has troubled me most and longest is that these people , having come within reach of the decent harmless restorative pleasures that I know to be possible here , are oblivious to them , as remote from them as if they were look  --  ing at panoramic shots of the valley on a movie screen . Propelled at 20 or 30 miles an hour by a roaring engine , one can experience the country only as " scenery " ? a painted landscape without life or sound " Scenery , " as we speak the word , involves an oversimplification and falsifica  --  tion of nature . It is landscape with all the vital details excerpted . It is the notion that permits the indulgence of our wish to prettify nature ? to pretend that nature is represented by butterflies but not mosquitoes , sunrises and sunsets but not hot noons , moonlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the mountain , as John Marin said , it is necessary to know what is on the mountain 's back One must go close and be still . And that can not be done with a motor , or with a motorized intelligence At 20 or 30 miles an hour the countryside can be no more than the pretty package a vacation comes in ? to be used like other packages , disposed of as soon as the contents is used up It is hardly to be kept in mind after it has been used , which means that it is likely to be used carelessly , or even contemptuously . At night the roar of the engine is replaced by the radio . The watch fires of ancient travelers in the wilderness have their counterparts in the loudly playing radios of these modern voyagers But it is no longer death that must be guarded against It is life . What surrounds them now during their night stops is no longer the threat of attack by some enemy or large animal , it is nothing more than the life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in natural places at night in the sounds of the air and the water and the night creatures , each sound spaced , singled out , sur rounded by a silence infinitely gi eater than it is , reacts ; ng to the stars It is maybe most of all that silence that they are so intent to guard themselves against . And there is indeed a potential of terror in it It raises , still , all the old answerless ques  --  tions of origins and ends It asks a man what is the use and the worth of his life . It asks him who he thinks he is , and what he thinks he 's doing , and where he thinks he 's going In it the world and its places and aspects are apt to become present to him , the lives of water and trees and stars surround his life and press their obscure demands . The experience of that silence must be basic to any re  --  ligious feeling Once it is attended to , admitted into the head , one must bear a greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's life If one has noth  --  ing in oneself with which to respond it would be unbear  --  able If the silence within the man should be touched by the impenetrable silence that ultimately surrounds him , what might happen to the thin partition of flesh and pos  --  sessions ? How might they have to be looked on then ? In the face of that silence ? enmeshed as he most likely is in the demands of a life in which the prevalent motive is to take all you can get , and the ultimate check is every  --  body else 's determination to do the same ? no wonder he turns on the radio . No wonder he opposes the river by strewing on it his garbage and his noise . No wonder he goes as fast as he can . Pursued into the wilderness by questions he is afraid even to ask , no wonder he finds his comfort ? to his bewilderment , surely ? in what he thought he wanted to , be free of : crowdedness and commotion and hurry and mess . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only to receive from it the intimation that he can not be free , that his life is surrounded by more de  --  mands and considerations than he can bear to admit . Man can not be independent of nature . In one way or another he must live in relation to it , and there are only two alternatives : the way of the frontiersman , whose re  --  sponse to nature was to dominate it . ' to assert his presence in it by destroying it ; or the way of Thoreau , who went to the natural places to become quiet in them , to learn from them , to be restored by them . To know these places , be  --  cause to know them is to need them and respect them and be humble before them , is to preserve them . To fail to know them , because ignorance can only be greedy of them , is to destroy them . Nature has never permitted freedom from responsibility . The world is a most wakeful and exacting account keeper . Abusive and greedy lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they are said to be in the Book of Doomsday . But that , the vacationing boatman seems often to con  --  clude , is the world 's fault , and to hell with it  --  and he dumps his breakfast plastic over the side . The concern I have expressed here is justified less by the damage I have seen done than by the damage I believe certainly will be done if our minds do not change . Forboating and the other mechanized pleasures , like every  --  thing else in our country now , are on the increase , both in the number of participants and in the power of the equip  --  ment . In all that I have said there is an apprehension of the question : If we continue our attempt to enjoy the world , as well as live and work in it , with our need for space in  --  creased by many horsepower , and our population getting always bigger , where are we going to find the room ? Such a question is not addressed to the possibility of control by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that the abuse of the world can be stopped by law . What I hope  --  and it is not an easy hope  --  is that people will begin to come into the countryside with a clearer aware  --  ness of why they come , of what they need from it and of what they owe it . I assume  --  and it is not an easy assumption  --  that the world must Live in men 's minds if men are to continue to live in the world . Our Declaration of Independence asserts ' that all men are created equal and , according to Lincoln , it was to this proposition that our nation was dedicated . Nevertheless , , except in one place , neither the Constitution nor the Bill of Rights mentions the word equal or equality , and in that instance it was for the purpose of effecting inequality of persons ( by barring amendments depriving states of their equal representation in the Senate ) . The constitutional fathers were , of course , not oblivious to the institution of slavery . But they sought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interference with the importa  --  tion of slaves for twenty years ( after which nature could be relied upon to provide an adequate supply ) and by com  --  manding the return of fugitive slaves . Yet they were not insensitive to what Gunnar Myrdal was later to call an American dilemma  --  the contradiction of actual practice to the preachment in the Declaration of Independence  --  as is made evident by their careful avoidance of the word slaves or slavery , and their employment instead of such euphemisms as " other persons " or " persons held to service or labor . " The first encounters the Supreme Court had with slavery occurred during Marshall 's administration , but these were only preliminary skirmishes ; the major encounter culminated in the most catastrophic decision ever handed down by the Supreme Court . Whether or not the Civil War was in any event inevitable , and as to this historians differ sharply , the Dred Scott decision made it so . It was considered by the American people to mean that under the Constitution , as interpreted by the Court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by constitutional amendment ( which the South 's veto power made impossible ) or armed force . ( Ironically , this was the first decision in which the Supreme Court applied the Bill of Rights ; a slave , Taney stated in his opinion , was property of which the owner could not be deprived without violating the Fifth Amendment. )
