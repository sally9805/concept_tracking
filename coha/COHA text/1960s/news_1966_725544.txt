txt Cairo Political pressure , apparently of Soviet origin , is holding up oil extracting operations highly profitable for the United Arab Republic . These operations also represent the leading United States private investment interest in the United Arab Republic at present . More than 10 million tons of additional annual crude oil production is at stake , which would save Cairo scarce foreign currency estimated at $20 million . This is now spent to import crude oil and finished products from the Soviet bloc and other sources . Sharp change felt Agreements between the United Arab Republic on the one hand and two American and one Italian firms on the other , if prop erly implemented , would also go far beyond domestic Egyptian needs . They would give Egypt a modest rank among oil exporting countries . But anti-Western pressure inside Cairo 's General Petroleum Organization began to operate in February , after the Soviets concluded semisecret $30 million oil accord with Egypt . Concessions signed Russian oil experts accompanying Soviet Premier Alexei N. Kosygin on his May 10-18 visit here are believed to have urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exclusion of Western ones . The oil story begins in 1963 . By that year the United Arab Republic had boosted production of its Red Sea and Sinai oil fields from 2,400,000 tons in 1952 to 6,000,000 tons yearly . In 1963 and 1964 the Minister of Industry , Azziz Sidky , signed a series of concession agreements with the Western companies . Philipps Petroleum Company of Oklahoma took a 43,000 mile concession for 30 years . It extends from the Rosetta arm of the Nile to the Libyan border , including coastal waters in between . Pan American International Oil Company , an affiliate of Standard Oil of Indiana , received prospecting rights in the Red Sea area and in the Western desert , also for 30 yea rs . Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi ( ENI ) of Italy got 12.500 square miles in the delta and eastern desert zones . ENI advanced 550,000 , - 000 in credits to the United Arab Republic for developing the fields and buying needed machinery . $100 million promised In addition , the three Western companies agreed to spend nearly $100,000,000 over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ENI owns a 92 percent interest in the International Egyptian Oil Company ( IEOC ) . This in turn holds 50 percent of another Italo-Egyptian firm , the Compagnie Orientale des Petroles d'Egypte . Neither the American nor the Italian firms have been able to move into effective commercial operations , despite signed contracts . Subordinates blamed Company sources say , despite goodwill at the top levels of President Nasser 's government , its subordinate officials appear afraid to implement the accords . Western sources attribute this in part to Soviet pressure . Some 70,000 tons of Soviet crude oil were imported in 1965 . Russia sold Egypt drilling and refining equipment . Egyptian crude oil and finished petroleum products from Egypt 's three refineries were sold to Czechoslovakia , East Germany , Hungary , and Yugoslavia , supposedly for hard currency . These arrangements and the February , 1966 , ones with Moscow , have perceptibly increased United Arab Republic dependence on the Soviet-bloc oil trade , Western economic experts here say .                 @ @ @ @
