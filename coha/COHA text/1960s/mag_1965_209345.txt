The computer has become a main stay of big business in the U.S. , but most small and medium-sized companies still find it too expensive for normal use . Last week two of the biggest com puter makers , General Electric and Control Data Corp. , introduced new systems that will offer the small business man the same computer advantages as the biggest corporation . Their move to what is called " time sharing " is part of a growing trend to market the com puter 's abilities much as a utility sells light or gas . <P> Dial for the Answer . Business some time ago began using computer centers to process data cards , count receipts or keep track of airline reservations from distant offices . Time sharing goes much beyond that . It links up as many as 500 widely separated customers with one large computer , lets each feed its own problems to the machine by tele phone through a simple typewriter con sole . The time-sharing computer can an- swer questions in microseconds , is able to shift back and forth swiftly among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large . <P> Although still in its infancy , time sharing is already being used by busi ness , government and universities . Bos ton 's Raytheon Co. prepares contract proposals , and Arthur D. Little solves problems in applied mechanics through a time-sharing system run by Cambridge 's Bolt Beranek &; Newman . An other time-sharing firm , Keydata , will soon take up the problems of Boston distributors of liquor , books , automo- bile parts and building materials . Con trol Data , which introduced two time-shared computers last week , will open the U.S. 's biggest sharing center in Los Angeles next year . General Electric al ready has 88 customers , last week added a New York center to its service centers in Phoenix and Valley Forge , Pa . <P> From New York , IBM gives shared-time services to 50 customers , including Union Carbide and the Bank of California . Under G.E .

The Massachusetts In stitute of Technology , one of the pioneers in time sharing , now has 400 users for its IBM 7094 computer , has served scientists as far away as Nor way and Argentina . Experts predict that by 1970 time sharing will account for at least half of an estimated $5 billion computer business , will be used as widely and easily as the telephone switchboard .
