" Uhuru ! " ( Freedom ) bellowed the burly , bearded African in red shirt and beaded cap . " Uhuru na ushindi ! " ( Freedom and victory ) roared back the weaving , excited mob of 20,000 arrayed before him in Nairobi 's stadium . Jomo ( " Burning Spear " ) Kenyatta had lost none of his magic appeal with the crowds in the decade since he was jailed for leading the bloody Mau Mau rebellion . He also still had plenty of his political acumen , for Burning Spear quickly converted the happy celebration of the tenth anniversary of his arrest into a political rally to further the course of his KANU party in next year 's elections . <P> As KANU 's boss , Jomo is not only out of jail and rehabilitated , but is also the hottest prospect to be Kenya 's first ruler when the colony becomes a nation , possibly within a year . So far , the electioneering has been fairly moderate , but trouble is threatened by something called the Land Freedom Army , a mysterious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered in the forests to revive the hideous Mau Mau oathing ceremonies over carcasses of strangled cats . Like the Mau Mau , they have begun slipping onto white farmers ' property by night to maim cattle and terrorize the inhabitants . Once again , Rift Valley farmers strap on pistols before going out to the fields . <P> L.F.A. already has an estimated 2,000 members ; police recently have been arresting 200 suspects a week , fearing that the whole project to give Kenya self-government will be jeopardized if mass murders begin again . Britain 's Governor Sir Patrick Renison urges Kenyatta to speak out against the Freedom Army but Burning Spear shrugs the problem away , suggests that the British are merely building up a pretext to delay independence . <P> A crack at the British still is sure to wow the crowds . Last week , KANU 's ambitious Secretary-General Tom Mboya , 32 , rose at a rally to lash out at the government because it imported the Duke and Duchess of Kent to inaugurate Nairobi 's new television station . " It 's disgusting that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their own leaders , " huffed Mboya . " All around us were white faces , and we were only little black specks on the scene . "
