COLLEGE FOOTBALL <P> Lights are burning late at No. 15963 Valleywood Road in Sherman Oaks , Calif . From the study , overlooking a kidney-shaped swimming pool , comes the whir of a movie projector . Hunched over the L-shaped desk , his size-50 jacket slung carelessly on the floor , a bespectacled bear of a man scribbles furiously on a note pad . It is some time between midnight and 4 a.m. , the hours that James Thompson Prothro Jr . calls his " thinking hours . " It could be chess that Tommy Prothro is thinking about : he is a tournament champion . Or bridge : he collects master points . Or business : he is heir to a Memphis real estate fortune , owns two soft-drink bottling plants in Oregon . But right now he is trying to decide whether to counteract a strong-side blitz with a sweep or a Sprint-H . Football is Tommy 's favorite hobby-and it also happens to be his profession . At 46 , Prothro is head coach of the U.C.L.A. Bruins , who last week were the No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underrated at that , as far as Missouri 's Coach Dan Devine was concerned . Dan 's scouts had watched U.C.L.A. demolish Pittsburgh ( 57-14 ) and Syracuse ( 31-12 ) on successive Saturdays , and he was ready to concede that " U.C.L.A. is the best team in the country " - better than No. 1-ranked Michigan State-even before Missouri played the Bruins last week . Devine 's Tigers were undefeated , they had sharpened their claws on Minnesota ( 24-0 ) and Illinois ( 21-14 ) of the Big Ten . They were 14-point underdogs at Los Angeles , and while they did better than that , they did n't do enough . Missouri made only five first downs to U.C.L.A. 's 19 , gained a total of 135 yds. to U.C.L.A. 's 407 . The Bruins fumbled the ball away on Missouri 's goal line , had another touchdown nullified by a penalty , presented the Tigers with six free points on a blocked punt . It was quite a struggle until Quarterback Gary Beban engineered a 56-yd. scoring drive in the third quarter . After that , Halfback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won the game 24-15 . <P> " He 'll Learn . " Victories , easy or hard , are not exactly traditional for the Bruins . For a decade , U.C.L.A. has operated in the shadow of its smaller ( 18 , - 600 students to 27,500 ) cross-town rival , Southern California . When Prothro quit a secure job ( 63 victories , 37 defeats in ten years ) as head coach at Oregon State and moved to U.C.L.A. last year , he inherited a team that had won only ten of its last 30 games . " Tommy did not come to U.C.L.A. to lose , " commented a Los Angeles sportswriter , " but he 'll learn . " <P> At first , sophisticated Angelenos were horrified by Tommy 's rumpled appearance and taciturnity ( " I am , " he admitted , " the oratorical equivalent of a blocked punt " ) . But they quickly fell in love with his peculiar , devil-take-the-hindmost brand of football . " We 'll try to do the unexpected , " he promised , " the things nobody would dream that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
