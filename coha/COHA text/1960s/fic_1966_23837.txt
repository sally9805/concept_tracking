Philip Roth O BEAUTIFUL FOR SPACIOUS SKIES From a forthcoming novel , " When She Was Good , " to be published by Random House in March 1967 When young Roy Bassart came out of the service in the summer of 1948 , he did n't know what to do with his future , so he sat around for six months listening to people talk about it . He would drop his long skinny frame into a hig club chair in his uncle 's living room and instantly slide half out of it , so that his Army shoes and Army socks and khaki trousers were all obstacles to cross over if you wanted to go by , as his cousin Eleanor and her friend Lucy often did when he was visiting . He would sit there absolutely motionless , his thumbs hooked around the beltless loops of his trousers and his chin tipped down on to his long tubular chest , and when asked if he was listening to what was being said to him , he would nod his head without even raising his glance from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair face , with those blue eyes as clear as day , he would look up at whoever was advising hint or questioning him , and see them through a frame that he made with his fingers . In the Army Roy had developed an interest in drawing on ears , good on hair , good on certain kinds of chins , and had bought a manual to teach himself the secret of drawing a mouth , which was his weak point . He had begun to think that he ought to go ahead and try to become a professional artist . He realized it was no easy row to hoe , but maybe the time had come in life for him to tackle something hard instead of settling for the easiest thing at hand . It was his plan to become a professional artist that he had announced upon his return to Liberty Center late in August ; he had barely set down his duffel bag in the living room , when the first argument began . You would have thought he was a kid returning home from Camp Gitcheegoomee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the time away what life had been like for him during his last year of high school , it did not take Lloyd and Alice Bassart more than half an hour to refresh his recollection . The argument , which went on for days , consisted for the most part of his parents saying they 'd had experiences he had n't , and Roy saying that now he 'd had experiences they had n't . After all , it just might be , he said , that his opinion counted for something  --  particularly since what they were discussing was his career . To make a point , in fact , he spent the whole of his third day home copying a girl 's profile off a matchbook cover . He worked it over and over and over , taking just a quick break for lunch , and following an entire afternoon behind the locked door of his bedroom , he finally got it right . He addressed three different envelopes after dinner , until he was satisfied with the lettering , and then sent the picture to the art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking all the way downtown to the Post Office to be sure that it made the evening mail . When a return letter announced that Mr. Roy Basket had won a five-hundred-dollar correspondence course for only forty-nine fifty , he tended to agree with his Uncle Julian that it was some kind of clip joint , and did not pursue the matter any further . Just the same , he had proved the point he had set out to prove , and right off . When he had been called up by the draft board for his two years ' service , his father had said that he hoped a little military discipline would do something toward maturing his sun . He himself seemed willing to admit bungling the job . Well , the way things turned out , Roy had matured , and plenty , too . But 67 it was n't discipline that had done it ; it was , to put it bluntly , being away from them . In high school he may have been willing to slide through with C 's and C minuses , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Which you have , Roy , in abundance ) , he could easily have had straight B 's  --  probably even A 's , if he had wanted them . But the point he wished to make was that he was no longer that C student , and no longer would be treated like him either . If he put his mind to a job he could do it , and do it well . The only problem now was which job it was going to be . At the age of twenty , nobody had to tell him that it was high time to begin thinking about becoming a man . Because he was thinking about it , and plenty , do n't worry . He continued to work on his own out of the art manual , in exasperation moving on to the neck and the shoulders , after four days of going from bad to worse with the mouth . Though he by no means relinquished his first choice of being a professional artist. , he was willing to meet his family halfway and at least listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit being tempted by Uncle Julian 's suggestion that he come to work for him and learn the laundromat business from the ground up . What was particularly appealing about the idea was that the people in the towns along the river would see him driving around in Julian 's pickup truck and think of him as some punk kid ; and the ladies who managed the laundromats would think of him as the boss 's nephew , and suppose his life was just a bed of roses  --  when in actuality his real work would only begin at night , after everyone was asleep , and behind his bedroom door he stayed awake till dawn , perfecting his talent . What was n't too appealing was the idea of using family as a crutch , and right at the outset . He could n't bear the thought of hearing for the rest of his life , " Of course , it was Julian gave him his start ... " But of more significance was the damage that accepting something like this could do to his individuality . Not only would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job and rose solely on the basis of personal privilege , but how would he ever realize his own potential if he was going to be treated like one of those rich kids who were just coddled up the ladder of success their whole life long ? And there was Julian to consider . He said he was altogether serious about the offer , providing Roy really wanted to work the long hard hours he would demand of him . Well , the long hard hours did n't bother him . A really vicious mess sergeant had once , just out of meanness , kept him on KP for seventeen consecutive hours scrubbing pots and pans , and after that experience Roy realized he could do just about anything . So once he had made up his mind the direction his life was going to take , he had every intention  --  to throw Julian 's language right back at him  --  of working his balls into the ground . But what if he went in with Julian , started taking a salary , and then decided to go off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to art school in New York , which was by no means impossible ? He was giving his parents ' objection every consideration ( whether they appreciated that or not ) , but if he finally did decide in favor of professional artist as a career , would n't he have wasted not only his time , but Julian 's as well ? Probably to his uncle , whose affection he valued , he would wind up seeming ungrateful  --  and maybe that would even be sort of true . Ingratitude was something he had to guard against in himself . Though he was sure his classmates at school , and As a storyteller , Philip Roth began winning critical and popular recognition in his twenties , even before he received the National Book Award for " Goodbye Columbus " in 1959 . In his third book , When She Was Good , " excerpted here in advance of spring publication , he turns from the New Jersey background of his first stories to the Midwest , where he taught , at the University of Chicago and the Writer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his buddies in the service thought of him as easygoing and generous  --  his first sergeant on occasion used to call him Steppin ' Fetchit  --  he had been told he had a tendency sometimes to be selfish . Not that everybody did n't , of course , but certain people had a way of exaggerating things all out of proportion , and he just did n't feel like giving an ounce of support to a suspicion about him which it was actually unfair for anybody , particularly his own father , to hold in the first place . Moreover , what he had a real taste for , following the monotony and tedium of the preceding months , was adventure , and you could n't really expect that the laundromat business would be packed with thrills , or even particularly interesting , to be frank about it . As for the security angle , money really did n't matter that much to him . He now had $2,000 in savings and separation pay , plus the GI Bill , and anyway he had no ambition to be a millionaire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind up living in garrets , he was able to say , " What 's so wrong with that ? What do you think a garret is ? It 's an attic . My own room used to be the attic , you know , " a fact Mr. Bassart could n't easily dispute . What he had a taste for was adventure , something to test himself against , some way to discover just how much of an individual he really was . And if it was n't the life of an artist , maybe it was some kind of a job in a foreign country , where to the natives he would be a stranger to be judged only by what he did and said , and not by what they knew about him from before ... But saying such things was often only another way of saying you wanted to be a child again . Aunt Irene made that point , and he was willing to admit to himself that she could be right . He was always willing to listen to what ideas his Aunt Irene had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to say in private and was n't just talking to impress people ( a tendency of Uncle Julian 's ) ; ( 2 ) she did n't butt in , or raise her voice , when you argued back or disagreed ( his father 's courteous approach ) ; and ( 3 ) she did n't ever respond with sheer hysterics to some idea or other he had most likely thrown out just to hear how it sounded ( as his mother had a habit of doing ) . His mother and his Aunt Irene were sisters , but two people could n't have been more different in terms of calmness . For example , when he said that maybe what he ought to do was leave Liberty Center with a pack on his back and see what the rest of the country had to offer , before making any major choice he would later he stuck with , Aunt Irene registered some interest in the idea . All his mother could do was push the old panicbutton , as they used to say in the service . Instantly she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years away ( which of course he did n't know ) , and to tell him that he ought to make up his mind to go to the state university ( and use that intelligence of his " as God meant you to use it , Roy " ) , and then finally to accuse him of not listening to a word she said . But he was listening all right ; even sunk down in that big chair , he took in all her objections , more or less . Those she had raised previously a hundred times or more he felt he had the right to tune out on , but he got the drift of her remarks , more or less , She wanted him to be a good little boy and do what he was told ; she wanted him to be just like everybody else . And really , right there  --  in his mother 's words and tone  --  was reason enough for him to be out of town by nightfall . Maybe that 's what he ought to do too , just shove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his mind what part of the country he ought to see first . There was always a sack for him in Seattle , Washington , where his best Army buddy , Willoughby , lived ( and Willoughby 's kid sister , who Roy was supposed to be fixed-up with ) . Another good buddy , Hendricks , lived in Texas ; his father owned a ranch where Roy could probably work for his grub if he ever ran short of loot . And then there was Boston . It was supposed to be beautiful in Boston . It was the most historical city in America . " I might just try Boston , " he thought , even as his mother went gaily on losing her senses . " Yes , sir , I might just pick up and head East . " But to be honest , he could use a few more months of easy living before starting in roughing it again , if that 's what he finally decided it was best for him to do . He had spent sixteen months in that black hole of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day in that scintillating motor-pool office  --  and then those nights . If he ever saw another ping-pong ball in his life . .. and the weather ! It made Liberty Center seem like a jungle in South America . Wind and snow and that big gray sky that was about as inspiring to look at as a washed blackboard . And that mud . And that chow ! And that narrow , soggy , undersized , son of a bitching really ) excuse for a bed ! Actually he owed it to himself not to go anywhere until he had caught up on all the rest he had probably lost on that g.d . bed  --  and gotten one or two of his taste buds back to functioning too . After an experience like that he surely could n't say he minded having breakfast served to him in a nice bright kitchen every morning , and having a room of his own again where everything did n't have to be squared-away with a plumb bob , or taking as long as he wanted ( or just needed ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing his business at either elbow . It felt all right , he could tell you , to eat a breakfast that was n't all dishwater and cardboard , and then to settle down in the living room with the Leader , and read it at your leisure , without somebody pulling the sports page right up out of your hands . As for his mother chattering away at him nonstop from the kitchen , he was n't so stupid that he could n't understand that why she was concerned for him was because he happened to be her son . She loved him . Simple . Sometimes when he finished with the paper he would come into the kitchen where she was working and , no matter what silly thing she was saying , put his arms around her and tell her what a good kid she was . Sometimes he 'd even dance a few steps with her , singing some popular song into her ear . it did n't cost him anything , and as far as she was concerned , it was seventh heaven . She really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pampering ways were a little embarrassing at this stage of the game . Like sending him that package of toilet-seat liners . That 's what he had received at mail call one day : a hundred large white tissues , each in the shape of a doughnut , which she had seen advertised in a medical magazine at the doctor 's office , and which he was supposed to sit on  --  in the Army . At first he actually thought of showing them to his first sergeant , who had been wounded in the neck at Anzio during World War II . But thinking that Sergeant Hickey might misunderstand , and instead of making fun of his mother , make fun of him , he had strolled around back of the mess hall late that night and furtively dumped them into a can of frozen garbage , careful first to remove and destroy the card she had enclosed . It read , " Roy , please use these . Not everyone is from a clean home . " a story by Philip Roth 69 Which was a perfect case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that he was a grown-up who you could n't do things like that to anymore . Nevertheless , there had been times up in Adak when he had missed her , and even missed his father , and felt about them as he had in those years before they had started misunderstanding every word that came out of his mouth . He would forget about all the things they said he did wrong , and all the things he said they did wrong , and think that actually he was a pretty lucky guy to have behind him a family so concerned for his well-being . There was a guy in his barracks who had been brought up in Boys Town , Nebraska , and though Roy had a lot of respect for him , he always had to feel sorry for all that he had missed , not having a family of his own . His name was Kurtz , and even though he had the kind of bad skin Roy did n't exactly like to have to look at at mealtime , he often found himself inviting him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all got sprung from this prison ) , and taste his mom 's cooking . Kurtz said he sure would n't mind . Nor would any of them have minded , for that matter : one of the big events in the barracks was the arrival of what came to be known as " Mother Bassart 's goodies . " When Roy wrote and told his mother that she was the second most popular pinup girl in the barracks , after Jane Russell , she began to send two boxes of cookies in each package , one for Roy to keep for himself , and another for the boys who were his friends . As for Miss Jane Russell , her latest film had been banned by a court order from the movie house in Winnisaw , a fact which Alice Bassart hoped Roy would take to heart . That Roy read to Sergeant Hickey , sin/ they both got a good laugh out of it . In the months , then , after his discharge , Roy made it his business first to catch up on his sleep and second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter to ten  --  weIl after his father had disappeared for the day  --  he would come down in khakis and a T-shirt to a breakfast of two kinds of juice , two eggs , four slices of bacon , four slices of toast , a mound of Bing cherry preserves , a mound of marmalade , and coffee  --  which , just to shock his mother , who never had seen him take anything at breakfast but milk , he called " hot joe " or " hot java . " Some mornings he downed a whole pot of hot joe , and he could see that actually she did n't know whether to be scandalized by what he was drinking , or thrilled by the amount . She liked to do her duty by him when it came to food , and since it did n't cost him anything , he let her . 70 0 BEAUTIFUL FOR SPACIOUS SKIES " And you know what else I drink , Alice ? " he 'd say , smacking his gut with his palm as he rose from the table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hickey , who weighed two twenty-five , did it , but it was a good sound just the same . " Roy , " she 'd say , " do n't be smart . Are you drinking whiskey ? " " Oh , just a few snorts now and then , Alice . " " Roy ? " Which was where  --  if he saw she was really taking it all in  --  he might come up , put his arms around her , and say , " You 're a good kid , Alice , but do n't believe everything you hear . " And then he 'd give her a big , loud kiss on the forehead , sure it would instantly brighten not only her mood , but the whole morning of housework and shopping . And he was right  --  usually it did . After all was said and done , he and Alice had a good relationship . Then a look at the paper from cover to cover ; then back into the kitchen for a quick glass of milk . Standing beside the refrigerator , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then close his eyes while the steely sensation of the cold cut him right through the bridge of the nose ; then from the breadbox a handful of Hydrox cookies , one of his oldest passions ; then " I 'm going , Mom ! " over the noise of the vacuum cleaner ... In his first months back he took long walks all over town . and almost always wound up by the high school . It was hard to believe that only two years before he had been one of those kids whose heads he would see turned down over their books , Buffering . But it was almost as hard to believe that he was n't one of them too . One morning , just for the heck of it , he walked all the way up to the main door , right there by the flagpole , and listened to the voice of his old math teacher , " Criss " Cross , that sweetheart , droning through the open window of 104 . Never again in Roy 's entire life  --  neverwould he have to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his hand while old " Criss " gave him a problem to do in front of the entire class . To his surprise , the revelation made him very sad . And he had hated algebra . He had barely passed . When he had come home with a D his father had practically hit the ceiling ... Boy , the things you can miss , he thought , if you 're a little crazy in the head , and strolled on , down through the ravine and out to the river , where he sat in the sun by the landing , separating Hydrox cookies , eating first the bare half , then the half to which the filling had adhered , and thinking , " Twenty . Twenty years old . Twenty-year-old Roy Bassart . " He watched the flow of the river and thought that the water was like time itself . Somebody oughtto write a poem about that , he thought , and then he thought , " Why not me ? " The water is like time itself , Running . . . running . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . flowing . . . Sometimes even before noon he was overtaken with hunger , and he would stop off downtown at Dale 's Dairy Bar for a grilled cheese and bacon and tomato , and a glass of milk . At the PX in Adak they would n't make a grilled cheese and bacon and tomato sandwich . Do n't ask why , he once told Uncle Julian . They just would n't do it . They had the cheese and the bacon and the tomato and the bread , but they just would n't put it all together on the grill , even if you told them how . You could talk yourself red in the face to the guy behind the counter , but he simply would n't do it . Well , that 's the old chicken s -- t Army , as he told Julian . Afternoons he would often drop by the public library , where his old steady , Bev Collison , used to work after school . With his drawing pad in his lap , he would look through magazines for scenes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , and decided that rather than drive himself crazy trying to get a mouth to look like something that opened and closed , he would specialize in landscapes . He looked through hundreds of Holiday magazines  --  without much inspiration  --  though he did get to read about a lot of places and national customs of which he was totally ignorant , so it was n't time wasted  --  except when he fell asleep because the library as usual was so damn stuffy , and you had actually to make a requisition to get them to open a window and let some air in the place . Just like the Army . The most simpleminded thing , and you had to go around all day getting somebody 's permission to do it . Oh brother , was it good to be free . With a whole life ahead of him . A whole future , in which he could be and do anything he wanted . During the fall he would usually walk back out to the high school late in the afternoon to watch the football team practice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and down the sidelines with the plays . Close in like that he could hear the rough canvasy slap ! as the linemen came together  --  a sound he especially liked  --  and actually see those amazing granite legs of Tug Sigerson , which were said never to stop churning , even at the bottom of a pileup . They would pull ten guys off him and there would be old Tug , still going for the extra inch , the inch that by the end of a game really could be the difference between victory and defeat .

" Boy , " he 'd think , breaking the earth in his fingers , " that kid was Mt/Vile . " The guy you especially wanted to watch up close , just for the beauty of it , was the big left . end , Wild Bill Elliott . Wild Bill had spent three years faking the oppositi on out of their pants , and was the highestscoring end at Liberty Center since the days of Bud Brunn himself . In about one second fiat , he would fake the defense right , left , then cut left , buttonho ok , take a Bobby Rackstraw bullet right in the belly , then  --  wi th just a shoulder ? fake right again , only to turn and zoom straight down the center of the field  --  un til old Gardner Dorsey , the head coach , blew his whistle , and Bill came loping on back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long underha nd spiral toward the line of scrimmag e , and calling out , " Heads up , baby . " Whereup on one of the onlookers beside Roy would say , " 01 ' Bill would have gone all the way that time , " or Roy might even say it himself . From over on the baseball field he would hear the band being put through their paces for Saturday 's game . " Attentio n , please , band ! Ba-and ! " he could hear Mr. Valerio calling through his megaphone . and really , it was about as good a feeling as he could ever rememb er having , hearing the band start up with the alma mater W e ' r e d r i v i n g h a r d , F o r L i - b e r - t y , W e ' r e g o i n g t o w i n , A v i c - t o - r y . ? and seeing the first team ( three consecu tive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the huddle , clapping their hands , and the second team digging in , and Bobby Rackstraw , the spidery quarterbac k , up on his toes piping out the signals ? " Hut one but two ? " and then , just as the ball was snapped , looking up to see a faint white moon in the deepenin g sky over the high school . For the hour of the day , for the time of his life , for this America where it is all peaceful ly and naturally happeni ng , he feels an emotion at once so piercing and so buoyant it can only be described as love . One of the stars of the football team in the fall followin g Roy 's discharg e from the Army was Joe " The Toe " Whetston e . He was a fleet-foot ed halfback ( he 'd done the hundred in 9.9 ) and the greatest place kicker in the history of the high school ? some said , the history of the state . Since a s t o r y b y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 1 the summer , Joe had been dating Roy 's kid cousin Ellie , and on Saturday nights , while Julian and Roy were having a talk together , or a beer , Joe would come around to pick up Ellie and take her to what had become a weekly event for the Liberty Center Stallion s : the victory party . He would sit with the two of them in the TV room , while " The Princess Sowerby , " as Julian called her , decided what dress to wear . At first Roy did n't have too much to say to Joe . He had never really traveled with the athletes in high school , or with any gang ; Roy considere d himself a little too much of an individual ist for that . Not a loner , but an individualist , and there 's a big difference . But Joe Whetsto ne turned out to be nothing like Roy had imagine d . You might have thought that with his reputatio n , and being so good-loo king , he would turn out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wild Bill Elliott , who was big for spitting through his teeth into the aisle at the movies in Winnisa w , or so Roy had heard 1 . But Joe was respectful and polite to the Sowerbys ? and to Roy too . It took a while , but slowly Roy began to understa nd that the reason Joe sat there in his coat , nodding his head at whatever Roy might say , and himself saying hardly anythin g at all , was not because he was looking down his nose at him , but because he was actually looking up . Joe might be the greatest high-scho ol place kicker in the history of the state , but Roy had just come back from sixteen months in the Aleutian Islands , across the Bering Sea from Russia itself ! And Joe knew it .

Very shortly Roy began to hear himself on Saturday nights saying things like , " They sure gave you the rush act today , Joe , " or , " How 's Bart 's ankle ?

" Some nights now it was Ellie who had to do the waiting , while the three men finished up discussin g whether Dorsey ought to have converted Sigerson from a tackle in the first place ; or whether Bobby ( Rackstr aw ) was going to be too slight for college ball , bullet arm or no bullet arm ; or whether Wild Bill ought to go to Michigan ( which had the big name ) or to Kansas State , where he could be sure he was going to be with a coach who liked to move the old ball in the air .

After Joe had finished up ? " So long , Roy " ; " See you , kiddo " ? Roy would button his field jacket , turn up the collar , lean back on his elbows , stretch his legs down across three rows of wooden stands , and with a little smile on his face hang around a few minutes more watching the cheerleaders go through their ohso-important repertoire of tricks .

And the fact was that he and Ginger had never exchanged a word , and probably never would . However , she was built , as the saying goes , like a brick s.house , a fact Roy could n't seem to ignore , not that he always tried . In bed at night he would begin to think about the way she had of leaning back from the waist to do the Liberty Center locomotive , and he would get an erection ; at the games themselves , after a touchdown , Ginger would do cartwheels the length of the field , and everybody would be screaming and cheering , and Roy would be sitting there with an erection .

Even where Ginger was concerned there had been stories . Almost every guy in Liberty Center would tell you that you could n't get near her with a ten-foot pole , and a lot of the girls said she was actually thinking about becoming a nun . But thenthis fellow named Muffin , who was about twenty-five and used to hang around the high school smoking with kids , said that his friends over in Winnisaw told him that at a party across the river one night , back in Ginger 's freshman year ( before she 'd gotten so snooty ) , she had practically taken on the whole Winnisaw football team .

It was a typical Muffin story , and yet some guys actually believed it  --  though Roy was n't one . Roy 's usual taste in girls ran to the ones who were a little more serious and sedate about things ? Bev Collison , for instance , who had more or less been his private property during senior year , and was now a junior in elementary ed at the University of Minnesota ( where Roy thought he might decide to go at the last minute , if everything else fell through ) . Bev was one of the few girls around who did n't live her life as though she were in a perpetual popularity contest ; she would just as soon leave the showing off to the show-offs , and did n't go in for giggling and whispering and wasting whole evenings on the phone .

Actually it was because of this respect that he had never tried to make her go all the way . Still , it was the hottest and heaviest he had ever gone at it with anyone . In the beginning , they used to kiss standing up in her front hallway tror as long as an hour at a stretch , but all the time in their coats ) . Then one Saturday after a school dance Bev agreed to let him into the living room ; she took off her own coat and hung it up , but refused to let Roy remove his , saying he had to go in two minutes because her parents ' bedroom was . directly over the sofa , toward which Roy was to stop trying to puen ner .

Roy 's first thought was that he ought to get up and go home before Mr. Collison came down the stairs ; but he patted her a lot on the back and said everything was all right , and that he was really sorry , he had n't actually meant it ; and so Bev asked , sounding relieved , had n't he really ? , ' and though he did n't know exactly what they were talking about he said , " Of course not , never , no , " and so from then on , to his immense surprise , she was willing to let him put his hand wherever he wanted above the belt so long as it was outside her clothes . There followed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they very nearly broke up ; meanwhile Roy was pushing and pulling and pleading and apologizing , all to no avail  --  until one night , fighting him off , Bev ( inadvertently , she tearfully contended later ) sank a fingernail so deep into his wrist that she drew blood . Afterwards she felt so rotten about it that she let him put his hand inside her blouse , though not inside her slip . It so excited Roy that Bev had to whisper , " Roy ! My family  --  stop snorting like that . " Then one night in Bev 's dark living room they turned on the radio , very very low , and of all things , on " Rendezvous Highlights " they were playing the music from the movie State Fair , which had recently been revived over in Winnisaw . It was their movie , and " It Might As Well Be Spring " was their song  --  Roy had gotten Bev to agree . In fact , Roy 's mother said that he looked a little like Dick Haymes , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sing like him . Nevertheless , in the middle of " It 's a Grand Night for Singing , " Bev just fell backwards on the sofa with her eyes closed and her arms behind her neck . He wondered for a moment if it was really what she wanted , decided it must a story by Philip Roth 73 be , decided it had to be , and so , taking the chance of his life , drove his hand down between her slip and her brassiere . Unfortunately , in the newness and excitement of what she was letting him do , he caught the buckle of his watchband on the ribbing of her best sweater . When Bev saw what had happened she was heartsick , and then seared , and so they had to stop everything while she worked to pick up the stitch with a bobby pin before her mother saw it in the morning and wanted an explanation . Then on the Saturday before graduation it happened : in the pitch black living room , he got two fingers down onto her nipple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off visiting her married sister in Superior , and he was in the Army . As soon as he was shipped to the Aleutians  --  even before the first shock of the place had worn off  --  he had written Bev asking her to get the University of Minnesota to send him an application form . When it arrived , he began to spend a little time each evening filling it out , but shortly thereafter it became evident to him that letters from Bev herself had just stopped coming . Fortunately by this time he was more adjusted to the bleakness of his surroundings than had been the case on that first terrible night , and so was able to admit to himself that it had been pretty stupid to think of choosing a university because a girl he once knew happened to be a student there . And absolutely idiotic is what it would have been if after being discharged he had gone ahead and showed to in Minneapolis , to find that this girl had picked up with somebody new , neglecting however to tell him anything about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it was still somewhere amongst " his papers , " all of which he planned to go through as soon as he could have three or four uninterrupted days so as to do the job right . The cheerleader Roy was sort of interested in was named Mary Littlefield , though everybody called her " Monkey , " he soon discovered . She was small and had dark hangs and for a short girl she had a terrific figure ( which you really could n't say was the case with Beverly Collison , who in his bitterness Roy had come to characterize , 74 0 BEAUTIFUL FOR SPACIOUS SKIES and not unjustly , as " flat as a board " ) . Monkey Littlefield was only a junior which Roy figured was probably too young for him now ; and if it turned out that she did n't have a brain in her head , then it was just going to be curtains for little Monkey , even before the first date . What he was in the market for this time was somebody with a little maturity in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with these really terrifically developed muscles in her legs , and that she was a big-shot cheerleader did n't faze him as it had with Ginger Donnelly two years before . What was a cheerleader , anyway , but a girl who was an extrovert ? Moreover , Monkey lived up in The Grove , and so she knew who Roy was : Ellie Sowerby 's cousin , and a good friend of Joe Whetstone 's . He imagined that she knew he was an ex-GI simply because of his clothes . When she and her cohorts started in practicing their cartwheels , Roy would lace his fingers together behind his neck , cross one ankle over the other , and just have to shake his head . " Oh brother , " he would think , " they ought to know what it 's like up in the Aleutians . " By then it would be nearly dark . The team would begin drifting off the field , silver helmets swinging at their sides as they headed for the locker room . The cheerleaders would pick up their coats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first row of bleachers , and Roy would raise himself up to his full six feet three inches , stretch his arms way out and yawn so that anybody watching would just think of him as being more or less easygoing and unruffled . Then , taking one long leap to the ground , he 'd plunge his hands down into his pockets and start off towards home , maybe kicking high out with one foot , as though practicing his punt ... and thinking that if he had a car of his own there would probably he nothing at all to saying to Monkey Littlefield , " I 'm going up to my cousin 's , if you want a lift . " Buying a car was something he had begun to give a lot of thought to , and not as a luxury item , either . His father might not like the idea now any more than he had in high school , but the money Roy had saved in the service was his own , and he could spend it just as he liked . The family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be back in the garage at a specific time every night ; only with a car of his own could he ever be truly independent . With a car of his own he might just give this Littlefield a run for her money  --  once he had made sure that she was n't just an extrovert and nothing else ... And if she was ? Should that stop him ? Something about the muscles in her legs told Roy that Monkey Littlefield either had gone all the way already , or would , for an older guy who knew how to play his cards right . . . . Up in the Aleutians it seemed that almost every guy in the barracks had gotten some girl to go all the way , except Roy , Since it did n't hurt anyone , and was n't so much a lie as an exaggeration , he had intimated that he himself had gone all the way pretty regularly with this girl from the University of Minnesota . One night after lights out , Lingelbach , who really had the gift of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the U. S. A. was that they thought sex was something obscene , when it was probably the most beautiful experience , physical or spiritual , that a person could ever have . And because it was dark , and he was lonely  --  and angry , too  --  Roy had said , yeah , that was why he had finally dumped this girl from the University of Minnesota , she thought sex was something to be ashamed of . " And you know something , " came a Southern voice from the end of the barracks , " in later life those are the ones wind up being the worst whores . " Then Cuzka , from Los Angeles , who Roy could n't stand , began to shoot his fat mouth off . To hear him talk , he knew every sex secret there ever was . All you have to do to make a girl spread her chops , said Cuzka , is to tell her you love her . You just keep saying it over and over and finally ( " I do n't care who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maria Muntez " ) they ca n't resist . Tell them you love them and tell them to trust you . How do you think Errol Flynn does it ? asked Cuzka , who acted most of the time as though he had a direct pipeline to Hollywood . Just keep saying , " Trust me , baby , trust me , " and meanwhile start unzipping the old fly . Then Cuzka began to tell how his brother , a mechanic in Los Angeles , had once banged this fifty-year-old whore with no teeth , and soon Roy felt pretty lousy about saying what he had out loud . Skinny and scared as Bev had been , she was really a good kid . How could she help it if her parents were strict ? The next day he was able partially to console himself over his betrayal by remembering that he had n't actually mentioned her name . Lloyd Bassart had come to the conclusion that Roy ought to apprentice himself to a printer over in Winnisaw . His father liked to say the word " apprentice " just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The knowledge of this aversion in his son did n't stop him , however : Roy ought to apprentice himself to a printer over in Winnisaw ; he knew his way around a print shop , and it was an honorable trade in which a man could make a decent living . He was sure that the Bigelow brothers could find a place for Roy  --  and not because he was Lloyd Bassart 's boy , but because of the skills the young man actually possessed . Artists starve , as anyone knows , unless they happen to be Rembrandt , which he did n't think Roy was . As for enrolling in college , given Roy 's grades in high school , his father could not imagine him suddenly distinguishing himself at an institution of higher learning by his scholarly or intellectual abilities . Though Alice Bassart pointed out that stranger things had happened , her husband did not seem to believe they would in this instance . Lloyd Bassart was the printing teacher at the high school  --  not to mention the right arm of the principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end from the University of Wisconsin . When the new consolidated high school had been built in Liberty Center in 1930 , people still had a picture in their minds of Don Brunn making those sensational end-zone catches over his shoulder in the 1921 Rose Bowl . What catching a football over your shoulder had to do with organizing a curriculum or estimating a budget was something that would remain incomprehensible to Alice Bassart until the day she died , but nevertheless on the basis of that skill , lion , who had been teaching civics and coaching athletics down in a high school in Fort Kean , was offered the position in his old hometown . Being no fool , at least where his own interests were involved , he accepted . And so for eighteen years  --  eighteen solid years of midstream , as Alice expressed it whenever her anger caused her to become slightly incoherent  --  Don had been the principal ( at least he sat in the principal 's office ) and Lloyd had been what Alice Bassart a story by Philip Roth 75 called " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as hire a new janitor without letting Lloyd take a look at him first , and yet Don got the salary of a principal , and was some kind of household god to parents in the community , while Lloyd , as far as the general public was concerned , was nobody . When Alice got off on this subject , Lloyd often found it necessary to quote what he said were the words of a man far wiser than either of them , the poet Bobbie Burns : My worthy friend , ne'er grudge an ' carp , Though Fortune use you hard an ' sharp . He agreed that Don was a grinning nincompoop , but that was one of the facts of life he had learned to accept long ago . After this much time you certainly could n't go around all day hoping and praying that the fellow might see the light and resign ; if he could see that much light there might not be any cause for him to resign . Nor could you wait for him to slip on a banana peel ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to outlive them all , a.id for another , such an idea was beneath Alice even to think , let alone to say aloud . Either you could make your way through life with the bitter taste of envy always in your mouth , or you could remember that there are people in this world far worse off than yourself , and be thankful that you are who you are , and have what you have , and so on . Could Roy help it if he felt more like spending his evenings at Uncle Julian 's than at home ? Not that he considered Julian perfect by any means , but at least his uncle believed in having something of a good time in life , and his ideas were n't all about two centuries old . " Wake up ! " Roy wanted to shout into his father 's ear . " It 's 1945 ! " But that Julian knew what year it was you could see right off , even in something like his clothes . Whereas the big magazine in Roy 's house was Hvgcia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little too loud with his color combinations , at least for Roy 's taste , but you had to admit he was right in the current style , whatever it happened to be . Even his opinion of Mr. Harry S Truman ( " half asshole and half Red " ) did n't keep him from having a collection of Harry Truman sport shirts that would knock your eye out ... At any rate , to appear in a public place without a tie was n't something Julian considered a scandal , nor did he act as though life on this planet was coming to an end if Roy showed up at the house with his shirttail accidentally hanging out . That Roy was n't going to get all worked up over things that were only " externals " was something Uncle Julian 76 0 BEAUTIFUL FOR SPACIOUS SKIES seemed capable of understanding . " Well , " he 'd say , opening the door to his nephew in the evenings , " look who 's here , Irene  --  Joe Slob . " But sniffing ; not like Roy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered most vividly as he used to see him coming out of Mr. Brunn 's office  --  gray hair combed slick , mouth shut , tall and straight as an arrow  --  and wearing that damn gray denim apron , like the town cobbler . After he had come home from World War II , Julian had sat down to figure out what people needed that would be cheap and helpful to them and profitable to himself : he had come up with the idea of the laundromat . So simple , and yet within a year the quarters and half-dollars that the ladies in the towns along the river dropped into the washers and driers of the El-ene Launclromatic Company left Julian $20,000 to himself . Now Roy had no particular desire to follow in the footsteps of a businessman ; it was not only personal considerations that caused him to hesitate before Julian 's offer to teach him the business ; there was a matter of principle involved . Roy did n't know if he still believed the way he used to in free enterprise , at least as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Aleutians Roy had listened from his sack when some of the college graduates in his barracks had their seriousdiscussions at night about world affairs . He himself did n't say much then and there , but of ten on the following day he would find occasion , while sitting around the motor-pool office where ne was supply clerk , to talk over some of the things he had heard with Sergeant Hickey . To be sure , he did n't swallow everything this Lingelbach said that was critical of America . Sergeant Hickey was perfectly right : anybody could make destructive criticisms , anybody could just go ahead and start knocking things left and right ali day long ; to Sergeant Hickey 's way of thinking , if you did n't have something constructive to say , then maybe you should n't say anything at all , especially if you happened to be wearing the uniform of the country you thought was so terrible and awful . Roy agreed that Sergeant Hickey was perfectly right ; there were some guys in the world who would never be satisfied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver spoon , but still you had to give this guy from Boston ( not Lingelbach who was an outright loner and oddball , but Bellwood ) a lot of credit for his arguments about the way they did things in Sweden . Roy agreed right down the line with Sergeant Hickey and his Uncle Julian about Communism , but as Bellwood said , Socialism was different from Communism as day from night . And Sweden was n't even that socialistic . What had made Roy begin to wonder if after his discharge a person like himself might not be happy living in a place like Sweden was ( 1 ) they had a high standard of living , and it was a real democracy with the Four Freedoms ; but ( 2 ) they were n't money-mad . Bellwood said , the way people in America were ( which was n't a criticism , it was a fact ) ; and ( 3 ) they did n't believe in war , which Roy did n't believe in either . Actually , if he had n't just returned from sixteen months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten himself a job as a deckhand aboard a freighter bound for Sweden ; and once there found some kind of good , honest work , and not in Stockholm either , but in some fishing village such as he had seen photographs of in Holiday . He might even have settled down there and married a Swedish girl , and had Swedish children , and never have returned to the United States again . Would n't that be something ? To think , if that was what he wanted , he could pick up and do it , and without explaining himself to anyone ... However , for the time being he 'd really had his fill of the sun coming up at 10:00 A.M. and going down practically at noon , and the rest of what should be day being night . Probably that 's what got to the Swedes themselves  --  because something did . Sergeant Hickey , who saw all the magazines before they were put in the dayroom , came into the office one morning and announced that in the new issue of Look , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in any out-and-out capitalistic country in the world . When Roy later brought this up with Bellwood he did n't really have much to say in Sweden 's defense , except to start quibbling over percentages . Apparently there was a heck of a lot of gloom over there that Bellwood had n't mentioned and , very frankly , fur all that Roy was willing to sympathize with their form of government , by and large he would prefer at the end of a day 's work to spend his leisure time with people who knew how to relax and take it easy . Moderation in all things was his motto . Consequently he found that he would just as soon spend his evenings at the Sowerbys as hang around at home , where he either had to keep the radio at a whisper because his father was upstairs writing some report for Mr. Brunn , or else his father was downstairs and they were discussing something called Roy 's Future as though it werea story by Philip Roth 77 a body he had found on the front lawn : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with it ? As for Lloyd Bassart 's disapproval of Roy 's nightly social call over to the Sowerbys ( and of his brother-in-law Julian as an influence and confidant ) , he disguised his real objections by saying that he did n't feel Roy should make himself a permanent fixture in another family 's house simply because they had a television set . Roy said why should his father mind if the Sowerbys themselves did n't ? Uncle Julian was interested in what the postwar Army was like , and in what the younger generation was thinking , and so he liked to talk to Roy . What was so wrong with that ? However , the " talks " between Julian and Roy consisted , as frequently as not , of Julian 's pulling Roy 's leg . Julian got a kick out of kidding Roy , and Roy got sort of a kick out of being kidded , since it really put them on a buddy relationship . Of course , sometimes Julian went too far with his kidding , particularly the night Roy had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a human being unless he was doing something creative . As it happened , he was only repeating something he had once heard Bellwood say , but it applied equally as well to him , even though he had n't thought it up personally . Uncle Julian , however , chose deliberately to miss the point , and said it sounded to him as though what Roy needed was a good piece . Roy had laughed it off and tried to act nonchalant , even though his Aunt Irene was in the dining room , where she could hear every word they said . Julian 's sense of humor was n't always up Roy 's alley . It was one thing if you were in the barracks , or the motor-pool office , to say f. this and f. that , and another when there were women around . Where Uncle Julian 's language was concerned , Roy felt his father had his strongest case . And then sometimes Julian got his goat with his opinions on art , which were totally uninformed . It was n't the security angle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some la-dee-da art school ; it was the sissy angle . " Since when did you become a lollipop , Roy ? Is that what you were doing up there in the North Pole , turning pansy on the taxpayers ' money ? " But by and large the kidding was good-natured , and the arguments they had did n't Iast very long . Though Uncle Julian was just a couple of inches 78 0 BEAUTIFUL FOR SPACIOUS SKIES over five feet , he had been an infantry officer during the war , and had nearly had his left ball shot off more times than he could count . And even though he said it just that way , regardless of the age or sex of anyone listening , you had to admire him , because it was the pure truth . The guy who had called out , " Nuts ! " to the enemy had gotten all the publicity at the time , but apparently Julian had been known throughout the 36th Division as " Up Yours " Sowerby ; more than once that was the message he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have withdrawn , or even surrendered . He had risen to the rank of Major and been awarded a Silver Star ; even Lloyd Bass-art took his hat off to him on that score , and had invited him to address the student body of the high school when he returned from the war . Roy remembered it yet : Uncle Julian had used hell and damn twelve times in the first five minutes ( according to a count kept by Lloyd Bassart ) , but fortunately thereafter simmered down , and when he was finished the students had risen to their feet and sung " As the Caissons Go Roiling Along " in his honor . Julian called Roy " you long drink of water , " and " you big lug , " and " Slats , " and " Joe Slob , " and hardly ever just Roy . Sometimes his nephew had no sooner stepped into the foyer than Julian had his fists up and was dancing back into the living room , saying , " Come on , come on , Slugger  --  try and land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class how to throw a one-two punch ( though he had n't yet had occasion to use it in the outside world ) , would come after Julian , openhanded , leading with his right , while Uncle Julian would bob and weave , cuffing aside the one before Roy could deliver the two . Roy would circle and circle looking in vain for his opening , and then  --  it never failed to happen  --  Julian would cock back his right arm , cry " Ya ! and even as Roy was ducking his chin behind his fists and hiding his belly back of his elbows ( just as he had been taught in high school ) , Julian would already be swinging one leg around sideways to give his nephew a quicksoft boot in the behind with the toe of his bedroom slipper . " Okay , Slim , " he 'd say , " sit down , take a load off your mind . " But the best thing about Julian was n't his happy-go-lucky manner : it was that his experience in the Army made him appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to civilian life at the drop of a hat . Roy 's father had been too young for World War I and too old for World War II , and so the whole business of being a veteran was just one more aspect of modern life that he could n't get into his head . That a person 's values might have changed after two years of military service did n't seem to mean anything to him . That a person might actually benefit from a breather in which he got a chance to talk over some of what he had /earned , to digest it , did n't strike him as anything but a waste of precious time . He really made Roy 's blood boil . Julian , on the other hand , was willing to listen . Oh , he made plenty of suggestions too , but there was a little difference between somebody making a suggestion and somebody giving you an Order . So all through that fall and into the winter Julian listened , and then one evening in March . while he and Roy were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly began during the commercial to say that he was beginning to think that maybe his father was right , that all this valuable time was just slipping away through his fingers , like water itself . " For crying out loud , " Julian said , " what are you , a hundred ? " " But that is n't the point , Uncle Julian . " " Come on , get off your own back , will you ? " " But my life ... " " You 're twenty years old . You 're a twenty-year-old kid . Twenty , Longjohn  --  and it wo n't last forever . For Christ 's sake , live it up a little , have a good time , get off your own back . I ca n't stand hearing it any more . " And so the next day Roy finally did it ; he hitched over to Winnisaw and bought a two-tone , secondhand 1946 Hudson .
