txt What 's ahead ... Words may make the difference whether Peking attends a proposed worldwide disarmament conference or not . Such a conference will soon be debated in the UN . If a majority supports the idea  --  as expected  --  a call will go out . How that call is phrased will perhaps mean everything . One phrase most likely to repel Peking would be " United Nations . " Many UN analysts do n't think Communist China would come if UN sponsorship and and framework are stressed . Peking has rapped the UN too hard recently . It could n't easily attend now under a UN banner . Many who do n't think the spread of nuclear weapons can ever be halted unless Peking is rung in on the bargaining want the UN aspect soft-pedaled . Moscow asks for the conference by mid-1966 . But major political battles ? and perhaps some delicate wording ? lie ahead before a date can be set . Brazil , sued for $100 million by Dominican ex-President Bosch , is watching a suit of a somewhat similar stripe now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Brazil for its peace-keeping hand in the recent Dominican revolt . He also seeks $1 billion in damages from the United States . Brazil does n't think Mr. Bosch can make his claim stick . But it is concerned that no precedent be set at the UN that might make the Bosch argument valid . Belgium has brought a suit against the United Nations for damages stemming from UN peace-keeping in the Congo . Secretary-General U Thant recently allowed the claim . The Soviet Union has protested . Now it comes before the General Assembly Finance Committee . And Brazil , though not siding with the Soviets , is wary lest the case set a pattern . Trends ... A new , less bitter era between Moscow and Bonn shows signs of dawning . West German State Secretary Karl Carstens has just led a Bonn mission to Moscow . While it produced no political progress , it did stir up trade . The Soviets have ordered $100 million worth of German chemical equipment . And more deals are in the works . The Carstens mission was watched with special interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko . And everybody noticed that Mr. Gromyko 's references to West Germany were unusually brief and mild . While none of the diplomatic ice is visibly breaking the sunnier economic climate at least has dampened the bitter propaganda . West German officials hope this is a wedge that will ultimately pry open new progress on other matters . How and why . . . African foes of South African racial policies would like to twist UN screws on Cape Town a turn tighter . But they are making scant headway . Black African leaders at the UN have pressed since summer for a new Security Council meeting on the issue . But first the Kashmir crisis broke . Then African foreign ministers assigned to ramrod the matter could n't be assembled . Now the ministers are getting set to go to Ghana for an African summit meeting in mid-October . So antiapartheid planners have turned instead to trying to elect new Security Council members vigorously in favor of their cause . The Security Council expands from 11 to 15 scats in January and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , three of the five veto powers ? Britain , France , and the United States ? are reluctant to rap South Africa . They are all against its white supremacist policies , but they oppose UN sanctions . That 60,000 kilograms worth of nuclear warheads the United States offered to convert to peaceful uses represents an enormous pile of power potential . But when American Ambassador Arthur J. Goldberg proposed it at the UN recently ? in exchange for Soviet conversion of 40 , - 000 kilograms worth  --  he did n't make it clear just how much of a pile . He since has . The fissionable material taken from the destroyed American and Soviet warheads together " could produce energy equivalent to several years ' power output by all of the developing countries Df Africa , Asia , and Latin America combined . " Put another way , it would amount to more than two-thirds of the entire yearly electrical output of both the United States and the Soviet Union .                 @ @ @ @
