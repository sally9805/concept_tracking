Hordes of 52-ton tanks churned up choking waves of orange dust over California 's Mojave Desert . Oil-drum devices released mushroom clouds to simulate atomic attack . In the 105 heat , smoke generators threw up acrid screens . Fighter-bombers singed the sand with the blast of their afterburners . The normally green Colorado River turned brown with machine-swirled mud , black with slicks of oil . Helicopters chattered , machine guns clattered and men swore . <P> All of the noise , grime and foul smells were generated by Joint Exercise Desert Strike , the biggest U.S. desert-warfare maneuver since General George Patton trained his tank forces in the same area in 1942 to prepare for the invasion of North Africa . Although considered a war " game , " Desert Strike ran up costs that smacked of the real thing . <P> The two-week exercise consumed some $60 million , since it involved more than 100,000 men ( 90,000 Army , 10,000 Air Force ) , 780 aircraft , 7,000 wheeled vehicles , 1,000 tanks . All were deployed over some 13 million acres of California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of 25 airfields from Texas to Oregon . <P> The exercise caused or contributed to the deaths of 33 men , including six in aircraft crashes , five by drowning , five in truck accidents , and two sleeping soldiers who were run over by a tank . <P> Is Desert Strike worth such costs ? General Paul D. Adams , whose Army-Air Force STRIKE Command is conducting the exercise , is certain that it is . Puffing on a cigar in his air-conditioned trailer at Needles , Calif. , Adams , 57 , who bears a striking resemblance to the original " Desert Fox , " German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel , explained : " There are lots of things we try to accomplish in an exercise like this . It 's the first time we 've been able to get a proper training area for the armored divisions for ten or twelve years now-where they will encounter the tactical and maintenance problems they would find in a real combat operation . We want to do all the things you 're supposed to be able to do in combat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the two services , and we 're working further on the development of joint doctrine . We 're trying out techniques of conventional and nuclear warfare . There 's a lot of desert in Africa and the Middle East , and if we ever have to go over there , we 'll know what we 're doing .
