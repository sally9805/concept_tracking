On Rome 's Via Veneto , the night was gay with lights and pink azaleas in curbside tubs . At a sidewalk cafe , Ivan Kro-scenko , 31. a man in a black leather jacket , sipped espresso and cased the pedestrian traffic with a predatory eye . A bearded giant strode past : Cinemactor Steve ( " Hercules " ) Reeves . " Mr. Universe , " sneered Kroscenko softly . " So who cares ? " He was after bigger game . " Linda Christian . Ava Gardner , Anita Ekberg . Jayne Mansfield . " he rolled the names lovingly across his tongue . " They are important people . They make trouble . " Kroscenko rose , slung the strap of his Rolleicord camera over a shoulder , and went prowling for trouble . <P> Trouble that can be shot with a cam era is Kroscenko 's business . A three-block stretch of the Via Veneto , cascading from the Aurelian Wall to the U.S. embassy , is his favorite hunting ground . Here , in the glittering array of hotels , smart shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is a paparazzo* one of a ravenous wolf pack of freelance photographers who stalk big names for a living and fire with flash guns at point-blank range . <P> Shot from a Box . The paparazzi are a small crew-a couple of dozen at most - and they are more bullyboys than news photographers . They lounge beneath lampposts , lips leaking cigarettes , cameras drawn like automatics . " Come see lo facio secco When he comes out , I 'll drill him , " they snarl , while waiting for their quarry to open a nightclub door . Then the paparazzi attack . These days they find more and more targets . Easter is past , celebrities are drifting down the peninsula , and hot times are ahead . <P> No one is safe , not even royalty ( see cut ) . In February on the Veneto , when U.S. Actor Ernest Borgnine and his estranged wife , Katy Jurado , wrangled in the street , cameras popped . They caught Actor Cornel Wilde struggling with a local heckler , froze Anita Ekberg 's bosom as it heaved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Katharine Hepburn passed through town recently , the paparazzi mounted Vespa scooters , putt-putted out to waylay her at Fiumicino Airport . Because Ava Gardner once called him a dirty name . Paparazzo Tazio Secchiaroli vengefully hid for hours in a cardboard box on a Cinecitta movie lot , finally got what he came for : an unflattering shot of Ava in an old bath towel , hair wet and stringy as a mop . <P> Like a King . In slack moments , the paparazzi manufacture incidents : one of their number taunts a show business idol into arm-flailing rage , and bulbs flash . The practice has a sound commercial basis : Italian newspapers and magazines pay as little as $5 for paparazzo portraits of quiescent celebrities ; pictures of celebrities rampant bring as much as $500 . <P> Legitimate news photographers scorn the paparazzi as streetwalkers of Roman journalism . But like streetwalkers , they cling to their place in society . Via Veneto cafes have found they are good for business . With paparazzi lurking just off the premises , cash customers mass to watch for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
