Almost 10% entered as sophomores ; 30% had scholarships , with a total value of $462,000 . Confidently donning crisp chinos and loafers or white sneakers , they set out frankly to acquire " the Harvard label .

" <P> Harvard has a way with such upstarts : it puts them through a first week so dizzyingly busy that newcomers can hardly think straight . <P> Join , Join , Join . No sooner had each boy been hit with his first-term bill ( $1,307.50 ) than he was deluged with requests to rent sheets and refrigerators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endless tests , physical and placement , pep talks from coaches and proctors , two presidential teas , and tryouts for everything from the Crimson to the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra . There were endless forms to fill out , and endless appeals to : <P> Join the Harvard Young Republicans campaign against Ted Kennedy . <P> Join the Wireless Club . Join the Music Club . Join the Harvard Band . <P> Join Tocsin 's program for peace and disarmament , backing History Professor H.

Sample : Government 130 , taught by Presidential Adviser Don K. Price , who " can usually be found in Washington , " with the result that " his appearances usually seemed unprepared , were often unintelligible and practically never interesting .
