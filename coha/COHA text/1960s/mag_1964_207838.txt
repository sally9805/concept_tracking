THE ITALIAN GIRL by Iris Murdoch . 213 pages . Viking . $4.50 . <P> <P> A reader is never safe with Iris Murdoch . What she best enjoys doing-and does better than any writer now working-is setting traps for her readers , baited with wit and camouflaged with urbane prose that all but conceals the bite of a gleefully seditious mind . <P> Her eighth novel opens on a scene of quiet domestic sorrow . Edmund Narroway , an early-middle-aged bachelor , has returned to the drab coal-mining town in northern England where he grew up , to attend the funeral of his widowed mother . Waiting for him are his brother Otto , a sculptor , his sister-in-law Isabel , and his teen-age niece Flora , whose " face had that pure , transparent look which we suddenly notice in the faces of young girls when they are no longer children . " Suddenly , at the crematory , Edmund sees the polite fabric of their shared grief rapped apart by Brother Otto : " I thought for a moment that he was ill or overcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing . He choked . Then , abandoning all attempt at concealment , he went off into a fit of Gargantuan mirth . He laughed . He roared . The chapel echoed with it . Our communion was at an end . " <P> Sexual Gavotte . The shocked Edmund returns home with the family , and Otto retreats in a drunken stupor to his studio . Isabel pleads with Edmund to stay with them ( " You are the only person who can heal us " ) . But Edmund , already suspecting that " there was no dignity , no simplicity in their lives , " decides to leave by the afternoon train . " Perhaps you 're right , " says Isabel . " It 's just that I 'm caged , bored . I want emotion and pistol shots . " <P> <P> In the garden after lunch , Flora confides to Edmund 's shocked ears that she is pregnant and asks him to find her an abortionist . He decides to stay and help her-and soon learns that there is enough unfettered emotion in the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mate and mismate in a series of scabrous sexual exercises as complicated as a gavotte . Otto confesses that he has been sleeping with the sister of his young assistant , a Russian Jew named David Levkin . ( " Otto is a wet-lipped man , I am a dry-lipped man , " says Edmund primly . ) And Levkin , it turns out , has deliberately made Flora pregnant in order to arouse the jealousy of Isabel , who is his mistress and insanely in love with him . <P> Comfort &; Commitment . As blow after blow falls , Edmund begins to doubt his sanity and to lose his control . Scarcely realizing his intention , he makes a clumsy pass at Flora and is discovered by Levkin , who jeers : " You are a buffoon just like your brother but you do n't even know it ! He , at least , knows that he is a perfectly ludicrous animal . " In desperation , Edmund turns for comfort to his old nurse , the Italian girl of the title . " I have n't touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No girls at all ? " she asks . " And no boys either ? "
