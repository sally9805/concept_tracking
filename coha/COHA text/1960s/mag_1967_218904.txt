Upton Sinclair 's book The Jungle , a scathing expos of the filthy conditions existing in the nation 's meat-packing plants , led to passage of the 1906 Meat Inspection Act . Still in force , the act requires the Department of Agriculture to inspect every red-meat animal whose carcass moves in interstate commerce - both before and after slaughter . Trouble is , 15% of the slaughtered animals and 25% of the processed meat do not cross state lines and thus escape federal regulation . Policing of this meat is left to the states , but only 29 have mandatory meat-inspection laws , and most of those are considered inadequate by the U.S. Department of Agriculture . <P> In an attempt to bolster state inspection services , the House of Representatives earlier this year voted 403 to 1 to provide grants of up to half the appropriated cost of state meat-inspection programs that live up to federal standards . In hearings before a Senate agriculture subcommittee , New Mexico 's Democratic Senator Joseph M. Montoya proposed federal takeover of any state 's inspection program that failed after two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Going a long step further , Minnesota 's Democratic Senator Walter F. Mondale last week was pushing a bill calling for federal inspection of all meat sold for human consumption . <P> <P> Flies &; Vermin . The meat-packing industry has changed from downright opposition to any federal intervention in intrastate business to outright embracing of the Montoya bill . For as the subcommittee hearings continue , meat packers and grocers alike are hurting from the publicity generated by mounting evidence of irregular and insufficient intrastate meat-inspecting practices . Graphic descriptions were presented to the subcommittee from a 1962 Agriculture Department report of non-federally controlled meat-packing houses alive with flies and vermin . The subcommittee was also told that in 1966 federal inspectors forced producers to discard 250 million pounds of unwholesome meat . <P> <P> In yet another test , the Department of Agriculture last July examined non-federally inspected processed meat products on grocery-store shelves-including Atlantic &; Pacific , Kroger and First National Stores-in 38 states . Of the 162 samples tested , only 39 were able to meet federal standards . In most cases , the products contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cereals and nonfat dry milk , additives that do not necessarily injure health but do devalue the meat . <P> <P> Switching Bills . With Mondale racking up mileage from his publicly popular cause-and with headline-grabbing Ralph Nader and labor unions joining the fight for across-the-board federal standards-it was not surprising last week that the Johnson Administration switched allegiance from Montoya to Mondale . Said Consumer Affairs Special Assistant Betty Furness : " The American housewife wants immediate and mandatory meat inspection . " Speaking of the Montoya bill , she added : " I believe the housewife is unwilling to wait two years or three years or longer before she can be confident that the meat she serves her family is healthful . " Best guess , however , is that the subcommittee will compromise on a bill closer to Montoya 's version so as to avoid a floor fight before a final vote by the Senate .
