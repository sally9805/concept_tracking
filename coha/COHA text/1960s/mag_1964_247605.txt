One morning , they were there . Accompanied by close to 50 brass bands , some 500 horses and at least two camels , they swarmed into Manhattan 150,000 strong , occupied 85 hotels and motor inns , added to the traffic jam , monopolized sidewalks , held seven-hour-long parades , and displayed a keen group sense of humor in a thousand hilarious ways , including occasionally entangling innocent natives in loops of invisible thread . They wore red fezzes , red and green floppy harem trousers , and embroidered jackets , and looked like wandering extras from The Forty Days of Musa Dagh . They were the respectable and respected members of the Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine of North America.In other words , Shriners . <P> As representatives of an organization forthrightly dedicated to whoopee in a good cause , the Shriners are pranksters by profession , obligation and tradition . Launched over a Manhattan lunch table in 1870 by 13 Masons determined to have more cheer than that earnest , philanthropic brotherhood provided for , the Order of the Shrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all Masonry . Only 32nd-degree Masons or Knights Templar are eligible - though admittedly their degree can be attained , if a man puts his mind to study , in a matter of months . The Shriners ' caste mark , worn proudly if sometimes absurdly , is a maroon felt hat that can conceal but does little else for a shiny bald head . <P> Manna from Mecca . Why a fez ? The most dedicated Shriner is hard put to say . The reason is that the history of the Shrine was invented after its founding , and has been elaborated ever since . The fact seems to be that one of the 13 founders happened to have made a trip to the Middle East just before the historic meeting , and thought the Arabs were quaint and Mecca romantic . And in a country of egalitarians , there is something about titles like " Imperial Potentate " or " Grand Chief Rabban " that can make any true democrat tingle . <P> The belated attempt to create a history has " traced " the beginning of the order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kalif Alee ( whose name be praised ! ) , founded a " vigilance committee " to dole out punishment for crimes not already covered by existing laws . The committee became a select group of noblemen , presumably above reproach and therefore demonstrably better than other men . They evolved elaborate rituals and ceremonies . As luck would have it , a copy of the ritual ( in translation ) wandered slowly across the vast Near Eastern deserts to America , where it fell , like manna from heaven ( Mecca , anyway ) , into the hands of the first Imperial Potentate , Dr. Walter M. Fleming . For his part , Fleming dropped some of the dogma , amended the purposes to stress " the exercise of charity and the improvement of the mind " rather than " the gaining of all possible power and the purification of base elements from the land , " but was careful to hang onto what mattered . <P> And what mattered were the symbols of exotica that attended the organization , such as the jewel of the order and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and the special intramural greeting , " Es selamu alei-kum " ( " Peace be with you " ) .
