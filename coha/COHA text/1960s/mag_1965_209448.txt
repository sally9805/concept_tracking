To the bored , vacant-eyed teen-agers who hang out at the drive-ins and juke joints along Tucson 's East Speedway Boulevard , Charles Howard Schmid Jr. , 23 , was known as a swinger . A well-muscled onetime state high-school gymnastics champion , Smitty always had wheels , money , tall tales and an inexhaustible supply of available girls ' phone numbers . <P> Schmid went to bizarre lengths to build his image . He added 3 in. to his meager ( 5 ft. 3 in. ) frame by stuffing rags and folded tin cans into his black leather boots . He dyed his hair raven black , wore pancake makeup , pale cream lipstick and mascara . As for the cash , which he got in a generous weekly dole from his mother , Schmid bragged to the boys that it came from smuggling cars into Mexico , to the girls that it came from women whom he had taught " 100 ways to make love . " <P> Skeleton Search . Last week , because of his pathological penchant for bragga docio , Schmid was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Tucson surgeon . Along with two friends - one a 19-year-old girl - he was also accused of murdering a third girl . Police , who had found the two sisters ' skeletons on the desert , last week were still searching for the third . <P> The murders came to light when Richard Bruns , 19 , told police that Schmid had shown him a grave in the desert outside Tucson in June 1964 , a month after 15-year-old Alleen Rowe disappeared from her home . Last August , said Bruns , a few days after Gretchen Fritz , 17 , and her sister Wendy , 13 , had failed to return home from a drive-in movie , Schmid took him out on the desert again , showed him the Fritz girls ' corpses-only one was even partially buried-and boasted that he had killed them . Acting on Bruns 's story , Tucson police rounded up John Saunders , a 19-year-old high-school dropout who had moved to Connecticut , and Mary French , another 19-year-old dropout who was living with her family in Texas , brought them back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . According to their statements , Schmid , who was dating Mary French , and Saunders were at Mary 's house the night of May 31 , 1964 , when Schmid idly wondered if they could kill someone and get away with it . He suggested Alleen , a bright , pretty student who had once stood Saunders up for a date ; the others agreed . Mary French persuaded the girl to go for a drive with them . She was taken about five miles into the desert , where Schmid and Saunders walked her down to a dry stream bed and hit her on the head with rocks until she died . Then , Mary related , Schmid walked back to the car , got a shovel from the trunk , and told her to follow him . She did , found Alleen face down and bleeding , and helped bury her . <P> Next day Mrs. Norma Rowe reported her daughter missing , gave police the names of Schmid , Saunders and Mary French as possible sources of information . The three were questioned repeatedly , but police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home-a not uncommon occurrence among teen-agers in Tucson 's fast-growing , mobile society where few families stay long enough to put down roots .
