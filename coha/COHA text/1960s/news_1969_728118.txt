txt The click of heels echoed on the hard surface below . Voices to the left . Luggage scraping . Muted laughter . Sounds , everywhere sounds . I was blind . It had only been moments since Norman Dahl of the Illinois Lions clubs blind activities committee , had taped the gauze over my eyes and applied the wide blindfold , but already I was getting an idea of what it was like in the world of the sightless ? what is was like to be blind . Arrived at O'Hare We had arrived at O'Hare International airport early that crisp morning to board a flight to Detroit , there to transfer to a car for the trip 25 miles north to Rochester , Mich. , and the Leader Dogs for the Blind school . For the rest of the day ? flying , eating , traveling , walking , and just living ? I would be blind . I held Dahl 's arm and he led me away from the ticket counter and down the corridors of the airport . It was hard to concentrate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world all at once and for the first time . As people walked by , I remembered listening to stereo demonstrauon records ? the ones where the train comes at you and fades in the distance while you try to imagine what it looks like . It was a world , of electronic blackness with dots and flashes of white streaming across the insides of your eyes like when you first close your eyes to go to sleep in a darkened room . At this point , the noises were a turmoil of conflicting signals . " Now we 're approaching some steps and ... " My heart dropped into my toes . I was scared . A step ? Mt . Everest . But I told myself ' , my fear was unfounded . I stepped . There .. That Was n't so bad . Then we boarded the plane . I Temperatures changed . Voices echoed . T h e situation had changed and the body and brain were busy compensating for a handicap . The brain worked for me , selectively plucking meaningful noises out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Begin to See My ears heard what they should , my feet investigated the material beneath me , and my hands began to see as I groped for the seat belt . I love to fly . There is an exhilaration that comes from watching ground disappear and breaking thru billowing clouds into a beckoning sky . It would be missing this time . Depression loomed with its unseeing eyes and black stare . But the mood did n't last long . There was too much going on . Take-off might be terrifying for a sightless person not used to flying . You are immersed in a kaleidoscope of noise and sensation as if you are being launched in a jet-propelled cage that does n't extend beyond the seat and voice next to you . Back Into Perspective However , after the climb , voices of passengers in other parts of the plane and echoing air noises of a large plane in flight end the closed feeling and bring spaces back into perspective . I felt a wave of air sickness due to motion exaggerated when one ca n't see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dig in . It was more than hunger ; it was a test . Could I feed myself ? Could I be inde-pendent ? Dahl told me where the food was according to the clock . Fruit , 11 . Roll , 8 . Milk , 10 ; Omelet and bacon , 6 . Learns to Eat I fumbled , but soon found that weight , temperatures , pressures , and textures help you find food and tell you if it is secure on the fork . It may have been sloppy and uncoordinated , but eating that meal truly gave me a sense of accomplishment . The next battle was regaining balance after leaving the plane and on the way to the waiting car . Then the world of voices began again as we started the trip . I felt totally blind , not blindfolded . I could n't wait to get to the school , meet my dog , and take off on my own , without having to wait for someone to offer me an arm . Faced Car Sickness To keep my mind off being car sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see ? I tried to figure out where we were by the noises . Traffic sounds , echoes in underpasses , the length between stops , and the odors all combined to give me dews . But the sighted world was far away from mine , and I dropped into a feeling of invisibility , much as the ostrich imagines he ca n't be seen if he ca n't see . The feeling was temporary , however . As time passed I got used to the blindness and ignored it . I began not to even notice the blackness before my eyes . Imagination Takes Over Imagination took over and I visualized things or just saw nothing . It is not quite a feeling of staring into space . It is more of a beige world that has no form or color . It is a nothing . But when it becomes a nothing , you become a something . Blindness has been accepted , concentration becomes acute , and you learn . I had gone thru curiosity , depression , sickness , defeat , and victory in only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had . Cost Is $2,500 Dahl told me of the program at the Leader school . Dogs of many breeds are trained for 12 weeks . The trainers themselves have been blindfolded for 30 days so they will understand what the blind person is going thru when he arrives for the following four-week course . The cost ? about $2,500 for a team ? is underwritten so that the service is free to the blind . Lions clubs in many states finance 70 to 80 per cent of the work of the 30-year-old nonprofit school . In Illinois , Lions clubs raise money annually thru Candy Day for the blind , to be held next Friday . We were there . The car door opened , and a friendly voice announced , " Hi . Welcome . I 'm Poe . " Ile was Harold Pocklington , director , but " here we use only first names . This is family . " Voices Sound Friendly I felt trusting , almost too much so . Any voice sounds friendly when you have been in the darkness . I wondered if blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took a blind person 's tour of the facilities there , saw a porcelain lion statue with my hands , and then left for downtown for training with a Leader Dog . Poe and the others at the school give no special favors to blind persons . And it is welIcorned by the blind , because no one wants to think he is pittied or catered to . " There 's nothing more maddening , if you 're blind , than to go to a restaurant with a friend , only to have the waiter ask the other guy what you want to order as if you lost your mind as well as your sight , " Poe said . Downtown I met Dan , one of the trainers . We began without a dog . At the start of training , you walk behind a harness held by the trainer . He teaches you hand and voice signals , the proper way to find a curb , how to turn corners , how to keep in step . The trainer studies you . Are you hesitant ? Afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do in emergencies ? Are you outgoing or introverted ? What is your voice tone ? Matched with Dog The trainer uses this information to match you with a dog . The goal is a coordinated unit , a dog and human that act and move as one . It was time to bring out the dog. - I was excited . This was it . I Could hardly wait . There was Queenie , a white German Shepherd . I clasped the harness handle in my left hand with the leash resting across the handle and under my thumb . " Queenie , forward ! Good dog ! " Walks Quite Fast Away we went , four miles per hour , faster than most pedestrians walk . It is a strange feeling at first to go almost running off into the ' darkness . It was an exhilarating time . The more we walked , the better we got . But soon , the darkness remains I was n't scared . I believed in the dog . Own Job Easy I imagined the white dog detouring , around obstacles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low-hanging awnings . My job was so easy in comparison ? just walk along and praise the dog . I was not afraid of bumping into things , but I did run into the edge of a building . It was my own fault  --  I was walking too far away from Quenie . I laughed at myself and we continued . It was a good feeling to be normal , even tho blind . The walking was coming naturally , and I began to think about where we were . We started in an area that I thought must be alder homes on a side street because grass grew in the cracks of a broken sidewalk and traffic was almost non-1 existent . Crosses Some Streets We crossed a few streets , turned a few corners , and it was time to head for the business district . We got to a corner . Queenie stopped to give me time to find the curb , and then I signaled her to go forward . I started to step off the curb , but she would n't let me . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was dumbfounded about her actions until a car came whipping around the corner . That time the " good dog " and dozens of pats were truly heart felt . When it was clear , Queenie and I crossed the street , stopping before the up-curb , and continuing the walk . I could tell more now . I knew when we were approaching an intersection before Queenie stopped because of traffic sounds . I knew we were in a busy section now because of the people passing by , the noises , and the condition of the sidewalk . Curbs and minor obstacles taken for granted by the sighted became minor victories to us . Dan said many blind person 's fear turning themselves over to a dog and pull back , trying to stop the dog instead of going with it . That was n't my problem , but direction was . I had trouble trying to find the correct store in a block of stores . But dogs learn your routine and often know where you want to go and take you right there , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it . Story of Amputee Dan told me about one dog whose owner was not only blind but also a double amputee who collapsed while walking . Whenever the man would wobble , the Leader Dog would throw itself against the man 's legs to prop him up until he regained his balance . Dogs also walk slower for persons who have trouble with mobility . They seem to know instinctively that something is wrong . The lesson was over and Queenie was gone . I missed her . I could see how attached a dog and person could become in a short time . Experts vary on their preferences for travel aids for the blind ? some prefer dogs , others a cane or other mechanical device . No one method is correct for every blind person . But I could see how companionship would be a strong argument for a dog . Returns to School It was time to go back to the school grounds , have a late lunch , listen to a movie about the school , and talk to some of the students about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to college , played golf , and enjoyed fairly normal lives . By then I was exhausted . Reactions to blindness vary with the individual , but I had gone over stages that many blind persons go thru over a longer period of time : curiosity , depression , changing attitudes and habits , resignation , learning and returning to normalcy . It had been a mental and physical strain , but when the blindfold was finally removed , it was like being reborn . I could n't look at things fast enough . The day was over . The other students would stay there . Their blindness would not end . For me , it was over , but one thing would never be the same . From then on , I would be seeing things thru appreciative eyes ? eyes that had to be blind before they could really see .
