Satul7 POST Evening ? ? ? ? ? N ow when I try to remember what it was like , or when people stop me and demand a reasonable explanation , I think first of the sweet madness that was as much a part of the place as the incessant squalling of the crows Nearly always there was bright sun , but now when I remember , I think of the one afternoon when there was mist rising from the Ganges , and it is through that mist that I still see them , moving serenely among the sheshum trees with flowers in their hands . I see them smiling at me , as if from an immense distance , and it is their gentleness and the Maharishi 's laughter that make nonsense of all the reasonable explanations . Geoffrey , of course , foresaw the difficulties , just as he foresaw everything else , and so did Anneliese , who told fortunes and liked to listen to the Beatles playing music on the roof of their bungalow . That last morning they gave me oranges and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would transfer me to the other side of the Ganges . " They wo n't believe you , " Geoffrey said . " Surely you must understand that ? " I said I did , and Anneliese smiled and preSsed my hands , as if I 'd said something especially wise . Whatever anybody said there seemed especially wise , and nobody could make any serious mistakes . Even Mia Farrow 's abrupt departure from the ashram could be explained , as could her wanderings in the south of India . They wanted me to stay , partly because they thought I 'd begun to attain God-consciousness and partly because , later that afternoon on the shore of the river , Donovan had promised to sing . At the time both reasons seemed entirely plausible . I can remember thinking how pleasant it would have been to follow the others into the garden , where the Maharishi sometimes would speak to us in a voice that was both high and musical , like the piping of a flute . A month earlier , in New York , my reluctance would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew only as a name in the newspapers , presumably another in the succession of Indian magi who have promised the riches of the spirit to generations grown bored with the clumsier profits of the dehumanized West . The first news of his message had reached me a year before , through the witness of a disillusioned theatrical agent named Leon Auerbach . We had been smoking cigarettes in his office on the West Side , exchanging the customary polite clich  --  s about the low-grade sensibilities of all producers , the hollow opportunism of most politicians and the suffocating anxiety so prevalent upon the local scene . " The facade , " Leon had said . " The sickness and despair . " Every few minutes he interrupted the conversation to take calls from big-time show-business personalities on both coasts , smiling wanly across the desk as he assured them of limousines , the love of the public and their names in larger type . You see what I mean , " he said . I said I appreciated the miserable realities . and so got up to leave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from among the press releases in his drawer , the worn photograph of an Indian holy man . Sitting cross-legged in the traditional lotus position . the holy man smiled out upon the world from what appeared to he a calm height . " My guru . " Leon said . I left him on the phone to London , outlining a scheme to hold up the studio for another $100,000 , and I thought no more of the Maharishi until his sudden and much publicized appearance in New York last winter . He vanished as quickly as he had come , taking Mia Farrow with him to India . Four days later , knowing nothing beyond what Leon had told me and what I 'd read in the papers , I embarked on the pilgrimage that eventually led me to the Maharishi 's ashram in the remote Himalayas . Before leaving , however , I sought to learn the rudiments of his philosophy . In Which the Message Is Announced I lirst heard it in a concert hall on West 57th Street . from a hairdresser named Harold Fineherg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . some of whom had seen the Maharishi on television , and others , like myself , who had heard only distant rumors . For the most part they seemed to be people in their 30 's , orderly and reasonably dressed . without the expected flowers or bells.could imagine lawyers , psychiatrists , executive secretaries and accountants . Fineberg was introduced as one of only people in the United States qualified to initiate others into the practice of Transcendental Meditation , and he appeared onstage to a modest scattering of applause . A man in his early 30's. he had a narrow , sensitive face , and he wore his dark hair cut in bangs . Obviously convinced of what he was saying . he spoke with small , precise gestures , his language an amalgam of hip slang and philosophical abstraction , and his voice so gentle as to be almost inaudible in the back rows . He spoke for about 20 minutes . limiting himself to a general statement of the Maharishi 's teaching . " The Maharishi , " he began . " tells us that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and die " in the realm of relative multiplicity . " he explained . and therefore bind themselves to illusion , darkness and pain . Beyond thought and beyond matter , however , there exists the absolute unity in which all creation originates and which , at its purest level , constitutes only truth , light and joy , The absolute can be found within every man 's consciousness , and by reaching it , for at least half an hour in the morning and afternoon , a man can gain many benefits . Among these , by way of example , Fineberg mentioned relief of tension , peace , happiness , increased energy and creativity , success in business and improved relations with one 's wife or husband . The way of reaching it , he said . was through Transcendental Meditation . Once known to ancient sages ( among others . to Buddha ) , the technique had been lost for many hundreds of years but now had been found again by the Maharishi . " It is very easy , " he said . " very scientific .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The meditation he described as a process whereby the mind follows a simple word or sound ( a manfra through gradually finer levels of consciousness to the level of the absolute unity . The latter level he also defined as the " kingdom of heaven within " and a " state of unknowable bliss . " Throughout his statement the audience listened in respectful silence . as if they were children listening to fairy stories . Nobody smoked ; nobody shifted noisily in his chair , At the end Fineberg set forth a few guarantees and conditions . The technique , he said , had never been known to fail . Anybody , no matter how skeptical or stupid , could become an adept in the space of four days . during periods of no longer than an hour each day . The price of the initiation would be $35 for college students and a week 's salary for adults . At his initiation ceremony each candidate would be required to present six fresh flowers of any kind ) , a new white handkerchief and two pieces of fruit ( also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he still used mind-warping drugs ( marijuana , LSD. etc.i : neither would anybody in the midst of extensive psychoanalysis . So saying . Fineberg invited questions from the audience , which was a mistake . The questions at first continued the mood of quiet reverence into which Fineberg had brought his message . A homely girl in the front wanted to know if everybody got his own " secret word . " Fineberg assured her that everyone did , a suitable one corresponding to his or her particular vibrations . Sonlehody else wanted to know if the practice required difficult concentration , Fineberg i said it was an easy ! natter of letting the mind drift . Neither was it required to have faith or renounce liquor , women or riotous living . After about half an hour the audience began to get ominously restless . The more openly skeptical got up and left , indulging in discreet grunts of dis-belief as they moved toward the mirrored doors . The questions from those who remained acquired a harder edge , reflecting the general opinion that perhaps the Maharishi offered too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background ? " said an argumentative man in the back . " What are your credentials ? " Accurately guessing the intent of the man 's question , Fineberg said . " It 's not important . " " But then how can you presume ? " The same way you will , " Fineberg said , " when you know . " His answers became gradually more Biblical and cryptic as people pressed him about the money . A lady in a large hat accused him of holding out ; others asked why the Maharishi did n't give away the secret . as had Christ . or why the tickets at Madison Square Garden had cost as much as $10 each . " Our books are open to the Internal Revenue Service , " Fineberg said at last . " . . . I 'm not involved in that part of it . . . it 's not my thing . " At which point , moved by Fineberg 's distress . a Negro woman in a yellow sweater felt called upon to offer a supporting testimonial . She stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'd just like to say it works , " she said . " I 've had experiences beyond my wildest dreams . " A few of these she enumerated , her voice falling into the rhythm of a revivalist confession , and she concluded by offering to pass around photographs of her son , also a meditator , who 'd been rewarded by being sent to guard an American embassy . Why this was a boon she did n't explain . Fineberg smiled painfully . That kind of testimonial he did n't need . and he abruptly brought the questioning to a close . Tables had been set up in the lobby , he said , and the girls sitting behind them would schedule appointments for initiations . He explained that anybody still involved with marijuana or LSD must wait 15 days , in order to cleanse the nervous system , but they could make appointments in advance . " See Laura if you 're on drugs , " he said . About 60 people gathered in the lobby , patiently waiting in a double line ; among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions . Standing quietly in a corner , Fineberg smoked a cigarette and watched the procedure with melancholy interest . A girl in a chic pink suit approached him and said . " What if you 're afraid of disillusion ? " " Cool it , " he said . " Wait until friends do it . " During the next several days I talked with other followers of the Maharishi in New York , all of whom testified to the sudden burgeoning of the movement . Within the past three weeks , they said , at least 600 people had applied for initiation . The president of a New Jersey insurance company wanted to provide meditation for all of his 150 employees ; a woman in the Bronx wanted to buy it , as an anniversary present , for her son and daughter-in-law . Temporarily without proper space , the organization then was using the office of an entrepreneur named Kip Cohen . who ordinarily arranged psychedelic light shows for pop concerts . Characteristic of another type I later found prevalent among meditators . Cohen was young , engaging , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair and a mustache , and he was just past 26 , which depressed him . He 'd first seen the Maharishi on the Johnny Carson show , and he 'd heard that Donovan and the Beatles were into meditation . " With their endorsement . " he said , " I knew the thing could n't be too far amiss . " Born in Shaker Heights . Ohio . he 'd attended both Columbia University and the Carnegie Tech school of drama , but neither his privileged origins nor his education had brought him happiness . He 'd been through the " Zen thing " in the 1950 's and experimented with various drugs . He regarded the drug scene as a necessary but intermediate stage in the expansion of the mind , " like junior high school , " but it had left him short of his destination . " You can only blow your head so many times , " he said . " . . . The trouble with too many kids is that they keep repeating the same course . " The meditation he 'd found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " but without the debilitating side effects , either legal or physiological . He also attributed to it a source of energy he could rely upon . a clearer mind and a positivism of which he thought he 'd lost track . " I know that sounds like a corny bit . " he said . " like a television ad or something . but what happens is , you begin to dig the infinite . " Among all the enthusiasts I met in New York none surpassed Leon Auerbach , who had a new and messianic light in his eyes . I found him in his old office . throwing out papers with light-hearted indifference . He 'd abandoned his job as a theatrical agent , he said , and dedicated his life to the service of the Maharishi . The Maharishi on his last passage through New York had asked Leon to organize a world peace movement . and Leon had n't known how he could refuse . Vouchsafed a deeper insight into the affairs of men , he 'd come to understand that war and poverty proceeded not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion in the minds of the people . " If one person in every thousand meditated , " he said , " there would be peace for a thousand generations . " He had plans he could n't tell me about , the moment not yet being propitious , but he hinted that he would confer with those whom he called " the rich and powerful of the earth , " hopefully to persuade them to tend money and influence to the distribution of the IVIaharishi 's message . I asked him several practical questions about the extent of the movement and its financial structure , but these did n't interest him . He shrugged and smiled and said I must go to California and talk to a man named Charles Lutes . A world governor of the Spiritual Regeneration Movement , Lutes was the one man in the United States authorized to speak for the Maharishi , and in California the movement had become something very beautiful and very big . I came west on the same plane with Lutes. a stolid , handsome man in his 50 's who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wore a plain brown suit and spoke in a Rat and uninflected voice . He lived in the San Fernando Valley , and he 'd been in New York to make arrangements for the Maharishi 's concert tour this May with the Beach Boys . With a booking agent he 'd discussed the relative billings and the design of the posters , and he hoped the singing group would forgo the heavier rock . The Maharishi 's message he defined as " the message of the flower , " and he thought a hard beat might violate it . Among the Maharishi 's followers I found the older and younger generations divided into factions and offering various interpretations of his message . The same factions later appeared among the residents of the ashram , raising the unhappy prospect of political and doctrinal quarrels . Lutes had been with the Maharishi since the beginning , since he first heard him speak at the MasquersCliih n 114 ) lb-wood in the spring of 1959. that was the year the Maharishi , then known as " The Beacon Light of the Himalayas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West . For 13 years prior to this appearance , he had followed a life of secluded meditation , deciding to go forth only upon the death of his master . the Guru Dev . " He needed nothing , " Lutes said . " His coming to us must be considered an act of self-sacrilice . " That first year the Maharishi stayed in Los Angeles five months , formally establishing his Spiritual Regeneration Movement on a summer afternoon in Sequoia National Park . Lutes remembered sunlight , a grove of redwood trees and deer playing in an upland meadow . To his 20 or 30 followers the Maharishi even then spoke of a time when there would be spiritual-regeneration centers in every major city in the world , of a time when millions of people would embrace the technique of meditation . Two of those who heard him . both engineers , worked out the predictions on their slide rules and quit the movement . " They said it was an impossible dream . " Lutes said . " But now it 's all coming true . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Maharishi made nine journeys around the world , always during the Indian monsoon season , his tickets paid for by his supporters in Los Angeles . Meditation centers gradually opened in other cities , and the movement , known as the S.R.M. , slowly attracted other adherents . At present , Lutes said , the organization maintains centers in 50 countries and numbers itsmembers at I United States . In 1965 the S.R.M. set up a subsidiary corporation , the Student International Meditation Society to deal with the awakening interest on college campuses . Lutes explained that whereas the S.R.M. was a foundation and therefore constrained from sending money out of the country , the S.I.M.S. , being a corporation , could send money to a third subsidiary in Switzerland . From there it could be sent to India or elsewhere . as the needs became apparent . The details seemed to me complicated , and I asked him who managed the organization 's financial affairs . " The Maharishi. " he said . " has a head for just about anything he needs a head for . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the people in New York had objetted , and he explained that in the beginning the Maharishi had asked for no money . He then discovered that people in the West did n't value what they could get for nothing . " He brought them a diamond , " Lutes said , " and they treated it as if it were a worthless rock . Besides . thirty-five dollars is not much to a student . They throw their money around anyway . " For the rest of the flight we talked about the further meanings of the Nlaharishi 's message . about reincarnation and the life beyond . and about the " gatekeeper on the other side . " who inquires only about a man 's spirituality and never about his money . Sitting bolt upright and taking no interest in his surroundings . Lutes spoke with the fervor of a Baptist witness declaring his belief . Only as the plane lowered into its final approach over the San Diego Freeway did he confide thecircumstances of his own coming to the Maharishi Ile had fallen mysteriously ill several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors could discover what was wrong with him . He had the symptoms of a dying man ; he lost weight , he could hardly walk , he began to lose his sight , and yet , despite the most sophisticated tests , the doctors confessed themselves defeated . He suffered that way for two years , and then suddenly , when he 'd resigned himself to his fate , a voice came to him . The voice told him that if he wished to help humanity and commend his life to the service of others , then he would get well . Silently he agreed to the covenant , and that same evening , at 6:30 , he got up and walked . The following month he began to attend the lectures of Manly P. Hall , and there one night a strange man , a mystic , approached him and said , " You will meet a master . " He never saw the man again , but shortly thereafter a German scientist brought him a clipping from a newspaper announcing the Maharishi 's presence at the Masquers Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know . " The students at U.C.L.A. and at the University of California at Berkeley interpreted the Maharishi 's message as a means of enlarging their perception and extending their personalities . Their centers resembled campaign headquarters rather than tabernacles , and none of them mentioned God or the life beyond . Unlike Lutes. they could make easy jokes about the meditation . referring to the Maharishi as the little Indian wise man or super-guru . All of them displayed an open friendliness and humor that made their testimony difficult to doubt . Their statements conformed to more or less standard variations on the same themes . Many of them reported better marks and improved communications with their parents ; others spoke of " a feeling of sustained delight , like having anew car , " or of " plugging into a power source . " or of " being able to go ahead and plan my life as a success . " Almost everybody mentioned the name of Jerry Jarvis , the Maharishi 's most persuasive advocate in the United States and the man who had first brought them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , they said , if only for a few minutes . 1 found him in Berkeley , on an evening when the fog drifting in from the bay blotted out the upper half of the Campanile . We walked together across the campus toward a classroom where a group of students newly initiated into the meditation waited to ask him questions . A round-faced man in a tweed coat , Jarvis had a sweet smile and carried himself with beguiling lightness . He was 35 years old , and he 'd met the Maharishi seven years ago . Since then he 'd given up his job as a landscape architect , and like Auerbach in New York , had dedicated his life to the announcement of the Maharishi 's message . The week 's initiations were still going forward , he said . and it was a very beautiful time . Seated in tiers that spread upward in the form of an amphitheater , maybe 350 students acknowledged his entrance by their sudden , hushed silence . Jarvis placed himself comfortably on a high stool in the well of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectant smile straying across his pleasant face . Behind him on the blackboard a series of complicated formulas and equations remained from the day 's mathematics lessons . He first asked whether everybody had experienced satisfactory results , whether they had discovered increased clarity of mind and increased energy . Each question was answered by a large show of hands . Jarvis nodded and smiled encouragingly . and then invited questions from the meditators on their technique . A blonde girl sitting high up in back wanted to I hired a car and told the driver to take me to Rishikesh . He grinned and said , ' You go Beatles ? ' know what it meant it she fell asleep . Jarvis told her it was a successful indication , that it implied a release of tension and an adjustment of the central nervous system . Somebody else asked about daydreaming . That also was correct . He discouraged nobody , explaining that all responses were proper it the meditation was easy . Anything hard or strained was bad . To a boy who confessed a tendency to open his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass . There really is n't much to see . " Always he smiled in an oblique and secret way , and sometimes , apparently for no reason , he permitted himself gusts of sudden laughter . A girl said . " What if your nose itches ? Should you scratch or forget about it ? " " We scratch . " Jarvis said , At the end of an hour he announced a group mei btation and nodded at a student standing off to his left . The lights were dimmed , and for the next 15 minutes the entire audience sat in profound silence . They sat with their hands in their laps . their eyes closed , their heads inclined slightly forward , without coughing or shifting in their chairs . When it was over . Jarvis slowly raised his head and softly pronounced the words . " Jul Guru Dee , " a phrase meaning " Hail , holy teacher " and one that , being popular with the Maharishi , I was to hear often repeated in India . The lights came up . the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties . Nobody mentioned any , but a boy sitting toward the front asked about his own life , which was not going as well as he would have liked . He wore a full beard , a flat . black hat and a fatigue jacket on which was scrawled the ironic advice : ENLIST Now  --  DO N'T DELAY  --  AVOID THE RUSH . Since he 'd begun meditation , he said , he 'd been having a lot of trouble ; a lot of terrible things had been happening ; he 'd been evicted from his apartment and visited by the federal narcotics agents . " What about that ? " he said . " How fortunate , " Jarvis said , " that you started meditating . " Again he escaped into a gust of laughter , as did everybody else in the classroom . The boy smiled weakly and then also laughed . but not as convincingly as the others . The next morning . at Jarvis 's suggestion , I presented myself at the meditation center on Channing Way , to see what I could of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of threadbare ivy decorated the approach to a stucco building that once had been a sorority house . The signs on the door prohibited smoking and praised the Guru Dev . Within . just to the left of the door , a girl in a green smock sat at a desk , sifting through mimeographed forms . She had long brown hair and gentle eyes , bat she looked at me suspiciously . Jerry , I said , had sent me . " OK , " she said , " but take your shoes off . and talk in whispers . " Directly opposite the door a flight of stairs led to the second floor ; to the right , furnished with a piano and several uncomfortable couches , a long and narrow living room extended along the west side of the house . On the far wall somebody had tacked up a photograph of the Maharishi among the Beatles and their wives , all of them draped with flowers ; on the floor a stuffed panda sat staring into a broken television set . At 8 A.M. the first novitiates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them bringing their fruit and flowers in paper bags and others bringing it discreetly in briefcases . Almost everybody brought apples or oranges , but those dressed in the more exotic clothes invariably brought mangoes or pomegranates . A boy in a business suit appeared half an hour before his appointment and asked where he could buy flowers , This is n't , " he said apologetically , " my usual sort of thing . " " We have extra , " a girl said . Some of the students came with their girl friends ; others came silently and alone . They first left their shoes in the hall and then presented themselves to Lhe girl at the desk . She looked up their names in her book and took their $35 ; meanwhile another girl carried their fruit and flowers into the kitchen . The girls who helped out . all of them meditators , had the quiet . knowing smiles of girls who help out at poetry readings and paint the sets in summer theaters . ) Having made the preliminary arrangements , the students waited in Lhe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Upstairs Jarvis had only three initiators to assist him , and although they worked without interruption until 7 P.N.L. they could handle no more Lhan 100 students a day . I At irregular intervals a helper would stand in the doorway and beckon one of them . In the hall she would hand him a shallow , straw basket , in which his fruit and flowers were arranged , also his white handkerchief and a form indicating he had paid . Carrying the basket gently in both hands , he would follow her up the stairs . At equally irregular intervals other students would come down the stairs , clutching a single flower . They held the flowers loosely in their hands , as if they were unaware of them . and always there was a dazed and smiling light in their faces . None could explain what had happened to them . Before I left , I heard a boy say to his newly initiated friend , " Well . Jesse ? . . . Was it ... ? " Jesse opened his arms in a wide and exuberant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said something foolishly irrelevant . " Oh yes , " he said , ' ' . . oh yes . " Across the River and Into the Trees The plane started its descent toward Delhi at dawn ; through the rising mists I could see mud villages and fields of sugarcane . On the roads . not yet dusty in the heat . people and bullocks already were moving , and I could imagine pilgrims making their way to the holy places , their foreheads smeared with ashes and their minds preoccupied with the 99 names for God . In Delhi I hired a car and told the driver I wanted to go to Rishikesh , the holy city on the Ganges . He grinned and said , " You go Beatles ? " I admitted I did , and on the drive north , 128 miles through market towns and herds of water buffalo , he announced that many , many others had gone Beatles . From the local papers I learned that George Harrison and John Lennon had arrived over the weekend . The Indian press had pursued them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . and there had been unpleasant incidents . A photographer had been assaulted , and the editorials reflected a general bitterness and disillusion . We reached Rishikesh an hour before sunset , and the driver pointed across the river to the religious settlement of Swarag Ashram , beyond which , hidden in a forest , the Maharishi had his compound . The last light glittered on painted temples decorated with gaudy sculpture and verses from the Song Celestial . From a monastery somewhere in the surrounding hills I could hear the distant tinkling of bells . In the dry season at Rishikesh the Ganges is about 150 yards wide and still a greenish-blue color , the clarity of its origins not yet diluted by the mud and refuse of the plains . I crossed it in a motorboat crowded with pilgrims , many of them laughing and asking if I went Beatles . On the far shore , squatting against a low wall among a row of beggars , I encountered a man with a trident , whom I at first mistook for a citizen of the town . Naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soiled white cloth , he seemed to he some sort of religious figure . On his left arm was tattooed the Sanskrit character for the mystical " Orn " ; on his right arm there appeared the motto " Scraper fidelis . " He rose slowly and greeted me with the lazy indifference of a hippie who has made all the scenes . " You 're late , man , " he said . He identified himself as John O'Shea , formerly of Norwalk . Conn . The trident he explained as a symbol associated with the Lord Krishna . He himself , he said . did not frequent the Maharishi 's ashram , which lie considered insufficiently serious for his purposes , but he offered to show me around . Walking along the stony shore of the river . O'Shea told of his own odyssey . For four months he 'd been wandering in India . dressed as a sadhu and traveling on third-class trains . ' If you 're a holy man , " he said . " everything 's free , and nobody bugs you about the hashish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living on an ashram in a farmyard , and from time to time they searched among the caves and temples for a guru of their own . In and around Rishikesh , he explained , there were hundreds of gurus , of every conceivable persuasion . Before coming to India he 'd been in San Francisco , but Haight-Ashbury fell into the hands of the philistines. and besides , he 'd been selling acid and felt the heat moving ominously toward him . " I figured , " he said . " that it was about time for the journey to the East . " About half a mile south of town , he Left me at the lower end of a sandy path that led upward between a random series of low . stone buildings . Across the path a banner strung between bamboo poles bore the single word . WELCOME . Beyond , at the Point where the path turned more steeply upward , a Hindu guard stood somberly in front of a wooden gate in a barbed-wire fence . The buildings at the higher elevations stood among sheshum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across open and stony ground . On a Ilat roof I noticed a monkey methodically breaking up a small , hard fruit the color of lemon . Among the lesser outbuildings I found one marked ENQUIRY ousacE. and therein I presented my credentials to a shy and smiling man named Suresh. the majordomo of the establishment . I had arrived at a difficult time , he said ; they were having some trouble with the press , and he was n't sure who was supposed to go where . He nevertheless gave me a blanket and assigned me a room in a stone house on the lower slope of the ashram . The next morning it rained , and a heavy wind was blowing . At noon Suresh knocked on the door and said the Maharishi had consented to see me . Together we walked up the hill , past Hindu boys warming their hands over charcoal fires burning in braziers at the corners of the paths . The Maharishi 's house stood in an isolated grove of trees on the edge of a bluff that commanded a wide view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was surrounded by narrow fountains and lawns . Suresh instructed me to leave my shoes on the veranda and wait in a small , dark room that appeared to be the Maharishi 's bedroom . A low bed covered with silk and an antelope skin stood against a wall sheathed in bamboo slatting ; on the opposite wall hung a political map of the world , and above it , on a shelf decorated with Christmas tinsel , there was a painting of the Guru Dev identical to others I 'd seen in New York and Los Angeles . Twenty minutes later Suresh ushered me into Things were unsettled , but the Maharishi knew about me and was considering my vibrations . the Maharishi 's presence , but now when thy to reconstruct my nisi impression of the inan I 'd heard so much about and come so far to see , I can think of nothing start ling or exceptional . No doubt I expected signs and wonders , and probably the expectation clouded my sight . I saw only a small , frail prof , sitting cross-legged among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it fell to his shoulders . and although he smiled and nodded at me , I noticed a vaguely troubled expression in his eyes . He had delicate hands and wore cheap . wooden sandals . Next to him . also cross-legged among cushions , sat Walter Koch , a physicist from Santa Barbara . and Mike Love . the lead singer of the Beach Boys . Koch had gathered a plaid blanket around his shoulders , and Love wore an astrakhan hat . The Maharishi welcomed me as a representative of the United States and said that if everybody in our two countries could he persuaded to meditate , then there would be peace in the world for 1.000 generations . His voice had a soft resonance in it , and he ended his sentences on a rising inflection . Koch questioned me as to my intentions , and when he had assured himself that they were honorable. he said to the Maharishi . " We 'll hit ' em all at once , Maharishi . TV . . . magazines . . . lectures ... saturation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . for no apparent reason , and then , listening to the wind . the Maharishi said . also for no apparent reason , " When Ringo conies. the storm clears the passage . . in the clear , Ringo comes . " Again he laughed , and his laughter contained within it a quality of maniacal innocence . The conversation ended with the Maharishi expressing the polite hope that I could stay for a few days . Koch led me hack down the hilt in the rain , explaining that things were somewhat unsettled at the moment and that 1 must n't misinterpret the Maliarishi ' ! , courtesy . A hoo , 4 , and worried man , Koch clearly had appoinird himself liaison officer between t he Maharishi aril l rite great world . Paul IVicCartney and Ringo Starr were expected that evening . and he hoped to avoid a repetition of the events associated with the arrival of the other Beatles . " It 's supposed to be a secluded course , " he said . " hut it 's getting like Grand Central Station around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next three days I remained in a state of ambiguous probation . Although denied admission to the upper reaches of the ashram , I was allowed to stay in the stone house below the gates . Suresh sent oranges and occasional messages , and every now and then Koch stopped by to make sure 1 had n't become dangerously cynical . He assured me that the Maharishi knew about me and was considering my vibrations and that pretty soon I 'd be allowed up the hill . " This is the hub of the universe . " he said . " The world looks to Rishikesh . " Wednesday afternoon the Maharishi convened a press conference on the open ground below the gate . In the morning Hindu boys set up his low dais and his antelope skin , and for the reporters they spread rugs on the ground . The reporters climbed the hill at noon , and as many as 50 of them had assembled when the Maharishi appeared an hour later . Walking in a slow and stately way , followed by two Hindu monks in white robes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The taller monk held an umbrella over his head , shading him from the sun . The reporters , speaking in English and obviously shocked by the size and luxury of his ashram , questioned him about the difference between his teaching and the traditional Vedic principle of renunciation . Answering with a distant calm and plucking the petals from his flowers , the Maharishi explained That Vedanta and Yoga had been grossly misinterpreted for many years . Throughout the proceedings , which lasted over an hour , the taller monk continued to hold the umbrella aloft , raising and lowering it as the photographers stood up to take pictures . The smaller monk squatted at the Maharishi 's feet . holding out the microphone of a tape recorder . At the end a man who 'd come from somewhere in south India asked if he could read a poem of homage that had occurred to him on the train . He had not intended it , he said , but a spirit moved him . The Maharishi nodded and smiled encouragingly , and the man . who was close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tamil language . When he finished . he kissed the Maharishi 's foot . saying , in English , that he hoped to sit at the Maharishi 's feet in heaven . The Maharishi acknowledged the compliment with a modest gesture of benediction and then asked the company at large if any of them had seen the article about him in that week 's issue of Life magazine . Nobody had seen it . " Too bad . " he said . " . . . huge picture . " With that he rose and walked back up the hill . followed by the monk with the umbrella , still carrying the remains of his flowers . Walter Koch stayed below , explaining to the reporters that none of them could go within the gate . The Beatles . who had arrived the previous night . insisted upon privacy , he said . and besides there was nothing to see except a lot of people meditating , which was n't very interesting . " This is not . " he said . " a guru situation . " That evening I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom strayed down the hill for a subtle change of scene and others who came to consult with the tailor . The tailor lived in a tent opposite the enquiry office , and during the nine clays that I was there , he never seemed to sleep . He made saris for the women and kurtas for the men ; the demand was steady , and at night he sewed by the light of a kerosene lamp . From the meditators I heard the gossip of the place and picked up miscellaneous bits of information . The Maharishi , for instance , disliked the color black . He preferred to see women in saris . most particularly gold and white ones . When he scratched . it meant he sensed negative viorations in the atmosphere . The Beatles appeared to be " straight kids . " but so far they had kept pretty much to themselves . Mia Farrow had left after a week to go on a tiger hunt , but maybe she would be back . The menu consisted of rice and vegetables , all of it boiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting pretty sick of it . The majority of those present were either British or American . but the Swedes were the best at the prolonged meditation , and one of them held the current record of 21 hours . On the basis of the early returns , the meditators appeared to divide into the same factions I 'd noticed in California . The older ones , those of Lutes 's generation , generally believed in reincarnation and assumed the I laharishi could work miracles if he so chose . In answer to the obvious question , a lady from Los Angeles looked at me with a flat , indignant stare anci said . " Why should lie ? They crucified Christ , did n't they ? " The younger generation not only did n't accept the religious extensions of the meditation . but some of them had begun to entertain even more serious doubts . A television actor named Tom Simcox , a humorous and intelligent man with a blond beard . conceded that although the meditation still seemed useful and straightforward , some of the people on the ashram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . inclined to ( aune on with alarming fantasies . " You 're silting up there at lunch , ' ' he said , and you think you 're talking to a real person . then suddenly you know you 're talking to the white rabbit . " On Friday I began to see what he meant . That morning Walter Koch granted me access to the whole of the ashram. and at noon I entered into a series of conversations I now remember as a single lunatic dialogue that lasted for six days . The narrow dining table stood in a grove of trees a few hundred yards beyond the Maharishi 's house and commanded the same fine view of the river . There everybody assembled between meditations. coming and going at random , changing places like the figures in a dance . Hindu boys served the same bland and tasteless meals at a-most any hour of the day ; in the lower branches of the trees the crows and monkeys watched for chances to grab off a turnip or a crust of toast . At first sight the guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bizarre winter cruise . The women wore sans and shawls , and the men . many of whom had let their beards grow , sat with brightly colored blankets around their shoulders . Mike Love I noticed in a white coat , a blue satin tunic and a pith helmet . At the table , which was covered in oilcloth , they passed each other things with careful politeness , and their talk , which had about it a feeling of tenuous speculation , veered off in oblique directions . No sooner did I arrive than I heard two ladies arguing a subtle point in the doctrine of reincarnation . They both agreed that if a person 's last thought happens to be of a cat , then the person must return as a cat . The discussion had to do with what kind of a cat . One of the ladies believed that if a person 's spiritual attainment had been sufficiently high , then he would return as a happy and well-loved cat . The other lady dismissed this interpretation as being overly sentimental . The Beatles appeared toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dressed in romantic combinations of mod and Indian costumes , they came as a group . accompanied by their wives . also in vivid and trailing silks . They moved slowly , their heavy gold chains and pendants swinging solemnly against their chests , and the girls , all of whom had long , blonde hair , evoked images of maidens rescued from castles . Collectively they looked like characters from a strange and wonderful movie as yet unseen . They sat in a row on one side of the table , and Paul McCartney said he 'd had a dream . To Anneliese Braun , an elfin woman to whom everyone applied on such matters , he explained that in his dream he 'd been trapped in a leaking submarine of indeterminate color . When all appeared lost . however , the submarine surfaced in a crowded London street . Anneliese clapped her hands in the enthusiastic way she had . like a child seeing his first snowfall . How very nice , she said , wondering if McCartney understood . He smiled and said he did n't think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , " . . . it 's the perfect meditation dream . " The voyage in the submarine she interpreted as the descent toward pure consciousness through the vehicle of the maniru ; the leaks represented anxiety , and the emergence in the street indicated a return to normal life , which was the purpose of all good meditation . The other people present applauded , and in the ensuing silence at the far end of the table , I heard somebody say , ' I 'm sure it 's Wednesday , but they 're trying to tell me it 's Saturday . "
