A BIRD ON THE MESA A Story by William Eastlake T H E blue mesa rose through the clouds like an atoll . From above there was nothing more to see , nothing , no land or life , not even water or sand anywhere , nothing , only this mesa in all the universe  --  nothing more . Those on the desert floor below could hear an airplane in those clouds shrouding the mesa , the roar going round and round like a distant high whining toy held on a lung twirling string by a child . Now they wondered when the airplane would run out of gasoline and sink to earth . " It 's been about an hour now . " " Yes . He must have been short of gas when he began to circle . I bet he can see the top of the mesa ; why does n't he land there ? " " Because he 'd never get down from the mesa. - " That 's true . Not without us . " The two very young men on horses  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting here on horses a hundred years before . That 's the way they were dressed , in blue hard pants , rough shirts ; and this land of northern New Mexico looked still raw and unshocked too , still virgin and bright , with gray-green sage and mesas that rose like undiscovered islands in the clouds . " He must have all the gasoline in the world . " " He 'll come down . " " We 've got to be patient . " " It really does n't make any difference to me . I 've got all the time in the world . " " The cattle can wait . " " Boy , can they wait ! " One of the young men who thought the cattle could wait for the airplane to do what the airplane would soon have to do was a Navajo Indian called Rabbit Stockings and the other , with the lean , sharply cut , and burning face was the son of the man who owned the cattle and , of course , the horses they both rode , Sant Bowman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical appearance , he did not have even the aquiline nose that most people associate with Navajos . Their friend , the son of Afraid Of His Own Horses , had one and so did Chee Bill Toledo , but not Rabbit Stockings . " You 're an atypical Indian . " " What 's that mean ? " " You 're not right . " " Oh , I 'm okay . " " Your nose is n't right for an Indian . " " What else is wrong ? Is my name wrong too for an Indian ? " " No , your name is fine , Rabbit Stockings . " They both watched up from atop their **32;1727;TOOLONG and nervous cow ponies to the thick , dark , swirling-in-gray , slow-moving clouds above , where the hornet buzzing of the plane whirred unremitting and mad . " What would an airplane be doing out here in nowhere ? " " Oh , this is somewhere , Rabbit Stockings . The most important country can be nowhere now . If I did n't want to he caught or seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nowhere to do it . " " Like the heifer we 're following who 's going to calve . She 's going nowhere to do it . " " Yes , or that plane up there above the mesa . " " I wonder what they 're up to that they came here to nowhere . " " Well , we 're close to the Mexican border , they could be trying to smuggle something across . " " Like what ? " " People . " " You mean Mexicans ? They can cross the river at night . " " They 've got a high fence on this side now . This way they are flying them over that fence . " " To this mesa ? It 's a long way over . " " Yes , it is , Rabbit Stockings . " " You know , Santo . . " Rabbit Stockings let the rein fall on the fabulous horse . " You know ? how do you know there are people up there ? " " Well , it 's not a bird above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rabbit Stockings said . y ES , there were people above the mesa , but right now there seemed only one , the man at the controls of the old , gaudily painted DG3 . The soft light from the fantastic and myriad panel of instruments lit only the bony jaw outlines , throwing the face and brow in hard relief . It was the face of a murderer . There seemed no one else in the ship . " You can come out now , " the pilot said , almost to himself , and then again , " I said you could come out . Venga ! " " Okay , okay , okay , " a man said , getting off the floor , and then nine others rose . The Mexican up first leaned over the pilot and said , " We there ? " " No , " the pilot said . " The weather 's been bad all the way . We 're going to have to land down there . " He pointed . " It looks like a flattop wallowing in the ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " An aircraft carrier . " " Yon were supposed to land us near Albuquerque , " the Mexican said , annoyed . He was the only one of the ten Mexicans who spoke English and he did all the negotiations with the Gringo who had agreed to fly them into the States of the United States for three hundred dollars apiece . " Are we in the States of the United States ? " a wide peasant-faced Mexican asked in Spanish . " No , " the tall , thin-faced spokesman who leaned over the pilot said . " We 're over an aircraft carrier . " " Actually a mesa , " the pilot said . " Una mesa , " the spokesman explained to the others . " Can we get down off it ? " " I never heard of one you could n't , " the pilot said , adjusting a large red mixture knob . The interpreter translated this and all the Mexicans seemed satisfied except the wide-faced peasant who thought about it a while and then touched himself and said , " Yo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He says he has , " the interpreter told the pilot . " Well , we 're going to land here anyway , " the pilot said , and he touched back the throttle and he thought : I can land there all right . It 's long enough to land . I do n't know about taking off again with this load . I do n't think so . The thing to do is land and conserve gasoline and when the weather clears I will take off again without the Mexicans . I 'm very sorry but I have fulfilled my contract . I told them I would land them someplace near Albuquerque . I 'll be sorry if they ca n't get down off the mesa . If they ca n't get clown off the mesa then no one will ever find out I brought them in . After a reasonable time , when this bunch is dead , I could bring in another bunch . It could work forever . I guess half the people in Mexico would like to come to the United States . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anyway , you could get away with a few more loads . This is quite a discovery , a new island entirely surrounded by clouds . William Eastlake of Cuba , New Mexico , is the author of a novel about the Southwest , " Go in Beauty , " and of short stories about Navajos , rodeos , and sports-car fanatics . Mr. Eastlake grew up in the East and studied in Paris after the war . This story is part of a novel in progress called " Something Big Is Happening to Me . " The pilot felt like Magellan or Balboa , but lighted by the yellow deep shadows of the instruments he looked more like a pirate , a well-dressed , successful , and even bow-tied Captain Kidd . Rut no one walked the plank , just that mesa , he thought . The pilot kicked the plane into a long glide toward the high strip ; the steep sides of the mesa were raked by long combers of clouds breaking in on the scrub oak and pifion and then sweeping back into the turbulent big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the pilot heard , really heard , the engine sing perfectly again and he began to let her down . The Mexicans got down on the floor and held onto each other . She hit , then hit again and again , and then hit hard , awful , once more , before she held the ground and rolled to a perilous halt on one leg . S A N T leaned back and touched the crupper of the horse . " Whatever it was , it lit . " " The bird 's on the mesa , " the Indian said . " And they ca n't get down . " " Maybe they 'll take off again . " " If it could Hy it would not have landed- " Rabbit Stockings tried to think of something wrong with this proposition but he could n't so he confounded Sant . " Do you know what , Santo ? We 've never been up on that mesa . " " You sure ? " " Sure I 'm sure . But maybe my forefathers ... " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , it means you had four fathers . Now , which one of them was on the mesa ? " " Does it make any difference ? " " I do n't suppose it does . Did you hear that ? It sounded as though the engine , the bird , started again and then quit . " " I like another idea now , " said Rabbit Stockings . " What 's that ? " " That they 're smuggling dope in that airplane , or running arms . " " What 's ' running arms ' ? " " It 's an expression . " " I like our first idea best . " " Running people ? " " Yes . Running people is better than running arms . Running legs would be more apt . " There was a faint mechanical coughing on the mesa and then silence . " The idea of running people is ridiculous when you think about it . " The Indian set his horse straight and felt secure in his judgment . Sant swung around backwards on his saddleand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark ceiling where the bird had lit . " Ridiculous when you think about it , yes , " Sant said . " But so is Rabbit Stockings . " " What ? " " Do n't think , Rabbit Stockings , " Sant said . H E man on the mesa , the pilot , was think- ing into the overcast . The Mexican illegal entries tumbled out when the plane came to an awkward stop . The front right wheel was off the ground , the left leg of the plane was in a hole . The Mexicans were under the shadow of the wing and waiting for the pilot to come out and tell them where to walk to get to Albuquerque . " First we better get ibis plane out of the hole , then I 'll show you how to walk to Albuquerque , " the pilot called from the cockpit . The interpreter got the Mexicans lifting and pulling on the plane and soon they had the purple-with-blue-wings and red-tailed bird that had brought them so far sitting alertly on a yellow apron of sandstone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio to try to get a weather report while the Mexicans began to scout the mesa for a way down and out to Albuquerque , excepting the Mexican with the thin mustache , the interpreter . He stayed put beneath the wing . The pilot could not call in for weather information because he had , of course , filed no flight plan . He had left a small field with his live cargo outside Guaymas , Mexico , five hours ago and he had hoped to land at the foot of the Sandias between Bernalillo and Albuquerque and get rid of the illegal Mexicans , then fly hack to Guaymas for more if all went well . The radio gave him nothing but loud squawking so he turned it off and watched the sky boiling around him to figure when he could take off . It was too bad he would not be able to take the Mexicans but he had gotten them to their States of the United States and that was all he was hired to do . There was a hole in the weather now toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idle to be able to get off quickly if there was an opening . It would be best to get off while the Mexicans were looking for a way down . There was no way down . " Shut her off ! " " What ? " the pilot called down to the Mexican interpreter . " Shut off the engines . You 're not going anyplace without me . " The pilot killed the motors and the propellers filially coughed to a jerky standstill . " You 're not going to leave me here to die . I could see from up there that there was n't any way down off this mesa . " " Let 's not be melodramatic . " " What ? - " Let 's make a deal . " " All right . " The interpreter seemed relieved . This was the kind of language he was used to interpreting . Ile had made a deal to be flown along for half fare if he would do the interpreting . But he did not want to die for half price on this mesa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others in ignorance and I 'll fly you off with me . " " What you want me to keep them inside of , did you say ? Speak more dear . " " Keep them occupied when they get back . " " Ocupadu . Keep them busy when they get back . It 's a deal . " " It 's a deal . " " Remember , die deal is we go off together . " " That 's the deal , " and the pilot wondered how he was going to get rid of this Mexican who seemed more than willing to interpret his comrades out of their lives . The bare sandstone stretched about twelve hundred feet and he doubted very much whether the ship could make it off the mesa with both of them  --  it would certainly be critical . Why take chances ? There was not only the risk of not getting off , there was the risk of another living witness if you got him off . Why risk double jeopardy ?  - -  - I think it 's called . Wait . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I saw some blue . " The muchachos are coming back , " the interpreter called up . " Can we take off fast now ? " " Not quite now , " the pilot said clown quietly . " You 'll have to placate them . " " Are you sure you 're speaking English ? " " Con them . ' " Okay . " The Mexicans came up and circled the plane with folded arms , their legs wide apart . They stared at the plane with small dark eyes , with somber and certain knowledge . They all wore loose-fitting , once-white clothes , but not the enormous wide hats you see in the cartoons and the movies . They did n't have any hats at all , and their hair was very black , cut short , and stood up like coarse dark wire in continuous amazement , and now imminent attack , like the hackles of a bear . " What did you find ? " The pilot asked down calmly from his perch above the blue wings . " Es una ista . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated . " Yes , " the pilot said surely . " But it 's in the United States and it 's near Albuquerque . What more . ? " " true rads ? " One of the Mexicans reached out a great arm and broke off a thick branch from a juniper tree and tapped it on the ground . " Este . " The translator did not have to translate the word " This " for the pilot . The pilot understood the weapon and he thought , well , I did n't want to produce my Smith and Wesson , a thirty-eight is very small and there are ten of them , but here goes because it is the only language that any of us seem to understand , and he reached under the seat and felt first with his fingers to feel if the clip was home and then he brought the blue gun over the wheel and pointed it down over the big blue wing straight at the faces of the marooned Mexicans . " Mira ! " he said , using one perfect Spanish word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said more quietly to the interpreter , " Ask them , ask them in Mexican , how they want to go . " There was a great silence . The clouds , the ocean of solid clouds around the mesa began to shift and , if not yet to break up , then to allow the first white light to beat down on the quiet tableau around the big blue bird on the high island mesa . Now the pilot fired one single echoless shot in the high sky over the heads of the Mexicans to impress himself with his strength and the weakness of those beneath his wings . I THINK we have been up on this mesa , " Sant said . " When ? " " When we chased the polled bull . " " No . " " When we lost the bronc . " " No . " " When we saw into Old Mexico . " " Not then either . " " When was it then ? ' ' " We were never on this mesa , Santo . " " Then this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone else just made it . " " The first time for us then . " " If there is a way up , " said Rabbit Stockings . They stared at each other from their glaring splash horses . The horses wore identical yellow latigo hackamores on twin blazed white faces ; they had crazed ceramic eyes , and now both pawed the red earth in furious attitudes of Greek bronze and cow-horse impatience . " We should ought to find that heifer first . " " One heifer in three will need help having her first calf . " " So we should ought to find that heifer first , but . " " Take this heifer though , I bet it 's the two in three that do n't need help . It 's like you said , I think , about my four fathers . " " No , it 's nothing to do with that , Rabbit Stockings . It 's that you 're right about it being the two in three . Why did n't I think of that ? " " You were distracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How are we going to get it down ? " " How arc we going to get up to get it down ? " Rabbit Stockings looked around wisely and then up at the heavens . " She 's beginning to break up . " " Yes , the bird will escape . Let 's see if we can find a trail up . " They could n't . They walked , then trotted , cantered , finally ran their horses around the tall mesa , examining carefully the steep crenelated sides that rose like a Roman temple , but forever up into the sky , the mesa punching through , hiding and hidden and itself concealing  --  what was it ? That noise , the big toy whir of a new bird on the mesa . " I thought I saw . . " " What ? " " I thought I saw a way up . " " Where , Rabbit Stockings ? " " There . That cave . " " It 's dark . " " And it goes in , not up , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark . You 're right , it goes in , not tip . " " I guess that 's it . " Rabbit Stockings placed his hands on his hips and looked around solemnly . " If we ca n't get tip we better locate that cow . " " That heifer before it becomes a cow . " " If we do n't , it may never live to be one . " " I said it much better , " Sant said . " Do n't always try to improve on what I say . " " After all , I 'm only an Indian . " " It 's okay to be an Indian , Rabbit Stockings , it 's okay , but remember the war 's over . Do n't still try to count coup . " " What 's that ? " " Take scalps . " " Keep me filled in on all the Indian lore , Santo . " " I 'll fill you in with a rock in your head , " Sant said . " Now , what are we going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , we 'll chase the heifer , but 1 hate . . . " " Me too . " " It 's only a plane that got lost . Soon it will take off and go home . " " Me too . " " No , no , Rabbit Stockings , see if you can pick up a track of the heifer . That 's what Indians are supposed to be good at , but in my experience they tend to confuse things . " " The bird will escape , Santo . " " That 's too had . " " You had them smuggling dope , arms , people , legs , everything . " " It was a weak moment . " " No , no , no , " Rabbit Stockings said and he swung his horse in repeated half circles to pick up the track . ' ' No , that 's good , Santo . It shows imagination . Why , in a little while , if you keep your nose to the  --  grindstone , is it ? ? why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian lore , if you rub two criminals together . . . " Sant hurled his horse into Rabbit Stockings ' horse and they bumped and swayed , pitching and tossing across the sage ; then a shot rang out . They pulled up their horses and stared around , then up at the mesa . " If we ca n't get up , there is nothing we can do , " Sant said . " Look , " Rabbit Stockings remarked , pointing . " There 's the heifer . " It was the track of the heifer and they followed it . It took a circuitous , wandering , faltering route , stopping and searching for something the way a heifer will , to find a perfect spot for her first calf . The animal is afraid , confused , worried , but proud and secretive too and wanting a high , dry sanctuary . " Look , it 's making for the mesa . " " The cave in the mesa . " " It might go up , after all . " " It 's very dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that , Santo . Follow me . Follow the Indian . " They tethered each horse to its left stirrup with its own rein . The horse thinks it 's tied . These did . Sant followed Rabbit Stockings and Rabbit Stockings followed the tracks until the light got dim , but the cave was narrow now and slanting upward so that the animal could not be avoided . " We 're going up , Santo . Just follow the Indian . " " Did you hear that ? " " Another shot . Do n't be afraid , Santo . Follow the Indian . " I 'd rather heat him in the head , Sant thought , but he followed the Indian , followed the faint dry noise , smelling old dust and cheap hair oil you bought at the trading post , smelling of secret places and Rabbit Stockings . " Can you see anything ? " 62 A BIRD ON THE MESA " Not yet , Santo , but we 're going up fast . " " If you ca n't sec anything . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A B O V E on the mesa , leaning out of the great airplane , the pilot with the long piratical face repeated down to his illegal cargo of Mexicans , but particularly to the interpreter , " Ask them how they want to go . " While the interpreter translated , the pilot waved the blue gun for attention . The pilot waving the small blue gun , who was very shortly to he kilted , had now lived almost exactly thirty-four years . Three weeks short . His name was Peter Wingo and his friends , when he had friends , called him Wingy . Peter Wingo had been born and lived his early life in New Haven , Connecticut , until he was turned down by the Air Corps because of chronic conjunctivitis , whatever that means- Peter Wingo found out what it meant , but he did n't tell anyone else what it meant . Peter Wingo learned to fly but could n't get a commercial license in the United States so went to Old Mexico , where he could not get a legitimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never thought he would have to use this gun . There seemed no other way out . " Do they understand ? Tell them to get out of the way . I am going to turn the ship around . " " Yes , but do n't forget me , " the translator called up . The pilot , Peter Wingo , started the engines and the great bird made a terrible roar as she began to pivot in a circle . " I wo n't forget you , " Peter Wingo called down to the translator from the still open cockpit . Now he slammed the window and began to taxi the huge , awkward , slow-moving bird toward the other end of the mesa for take-off . The translator screamed something at the other Mexicans and they all ran after the slow , waddling DC3 and one after another threw themselves on the tail of the plane , flat , and held on so they ' were all lying and holding onto the tail as the plane trundled slowly down to the take-off point . They are like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could they be so stupid ? I 've not met people so stupid since those doctors who turned me down for the Air Corps for poor vision . My vision is not so poor that I can not see them trying to get off this mesa on my tail , and my eyes will not be so bad that I will not see them brush off like flies when I get up some speed . The pilot , Peter Wingo , now had the DC3 all the way down at the far edge of the mesa wherehe had so perfectly hit while landing . The sky was clearing nicely now and in a few hours he would be back in Guaymas . Peter Wingo applied full brakes and gunned the engines . He could see the Mexicans on the tail begin to flutter and stream like old rags , their eyes and tongues popping out when the giant , raging wind from the backwash of the roaring eighteen-cylinder engines hit them . But there 's more to come , Peter Wingo thought . Wait till I get this thing up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more Mexican flies on the tail . As a matter of fact , they will be off before I get fifteen feet As a matter of fact , there they go now . The Mexicans could take no more punishment and they were fleeing the plane . Now they were all off . A few of them picked up sticks and rocks and hit the side of the tinny bird , making a hard , tinny noise , but even they now had fled from the great wind as Peter Wingo made the engines roar still more . Peter Wingo tried the ailerons and the rudder and checked out all the instruments . He could see the instruments fine and everything was okay . He was heading into the wind . He released the brakes and the great bird leaped forward for a perfect take-off , except that the heifer now moved into the middle of the runway . The heifer moved into the middle of the runway . The heifer moved into the middle of the runway ; everyone said that a thousand times afterwards . Peter Wingo would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying everything is perfect , I 'm going to get off , I 'm going to get off . But he was n't . He could see to a point of pifion and he knew when he passed this point as he thundered down the strip he could no longer abort the take-off , the plane then was committed to fly , and if something went wrong and she could not become airborne , then neither could she be stopped and the great DC3 with Peter Wingo , who could not quite see the heifer , would go skidding off the edge of the mesa and smash on the rocks nine hundred feet below . Now he gave the twin engines full throttle and the plane leaped down , down the runway , speeding past the rock and cactus like a hurtling horizontal rocket . Now it reached the point of no return , the point of pifion , and at this exact second Peter Wingo saw the heifer where it had emerged from a motte of scrub oak , where it stood and gazed around at the high , big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brakes and the hurtling bird lost all its grace and purpose and began to careen drunkenly at a wild speed as though it were being torn apart . " Oh ! " Peter Wingo saw the edge of the world coming up . " Oh , the damn cow . Oh God , the damn cow . How did a cow get up in the sky ? Oh , the damn cow . " The plane bucked now on one wing , then began to skid at a ridiculous cruel angle and make a terrible cracking noise as it fled to the wrong side of the mesa and then flared out over the edge and dropped , wingless , flightless , like a house in a hurricane , to the awful rocks below . " The cow . I never saw . 1 never saw . I never saw that cow in the sky , " were Peter Wingo 's last words on the mesa and on earth . Peter Wingo repeated them over the broken wheel as the plane fell ; he mumbled with stubborn , pathetic repetition as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Peter Wingo 's final thought , no one will believe , even with perfect eyesight , that there are cattle in the air after storms on the island mesas of northern New Mexico . ANT and Rabbit Stockings peered out of the scrub oak , after the cow , just as the plane went over the edge . " We missed it . " " No , there it is . The heifer . " " I mean the bird . It just flew . " " No , fell . " They both silently agreed about this , then looked around the high island mesa in wonder . " Look , Santo , your heifer is going to become a cow . " And it was too , and all the Mexicans appeared from nowhere with advice . This was something they understood and knew a great deal about , something that was not shocking , mechanical , different and indifferent , but was the same in Mexico as it was , as it obviously is , in the States of the United States . As the calf flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a dolphin , the flat-faced Mexican dropped his weapon stick and reached in quickly with his hand and broke the caul and the calf careened its head and breathed air , was alive for the first time on earth . " Es un buen torito . " " What ? " " He said it 's a beautiful little bull , " the translator said . " Yes , " Sant said . " And Rabbit Stockings here is an Indian . He does n't look too Indian , but he 's an Indian , and you gentlemen , I presume , are all Mexicans , " Sant said portentously , " trying the hard way over the border fence . Well , no matter . We came up here looking for an airplane , a big bird we heard . . " " That rhymes . " " Rabbit Stockings is conscious of poetry , " Sant continued to the Mexicans . " He ... Never mind . Follow me down . We  --  after all the noise , the shooting , we expected something terrible and we found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earth . How am I doing , Rabbit Stockings ? " " Terrible . You should have quit while you were ahead . " " Rabbit Stockings does n't understand , " Sant called back to the others as they emerged from the tunnel . " I 'm only an Indian . " They marched past the wreckage of the blue plane before they got back to their horses . Sant laid his hand on the withers of the Appaloosa horse and looked up at the huge , lonely mesa that was all visible now . " God never , " Sant said , " nature never , I mean people were never meant to fly . If we were , I guess we would have been horn with wings . " The Indian did n't seem to be appreciating this . Then Sant quickly mounted the high horse and said proudly , " Certainly people should n't fly without passports , not on Monday . " The interpreter translated this and the Mexicans scratched their black stiff heads and shrugged their shoulders and watched the boy on the Appaloosa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the procession led by two great horses wound through the bright purple butte section of Indian Country followed by the heifer , now a cow . The lead Mexican , right behind the horses , bore the calf . He carried it as if the new life were a thing of great portent , a redeeming and saving angel that , by some mysterious mission , had arrived in the sky at a zero hour to return them safely to this grand earth and these beautiful , odd inhabitants of these States of the United States .
