Compelled by sympathy and the necessity of the moment , Britain 's Queen reversed the customary ritual . Instead of waiting for her retiring Prime Minister to call upon her and advise her of his choice as a successor , Elizabeth II rode across London to King Edward VII Hospital . There , in a peacock-green coat and matching hat , she sat in an armchair facing the high , white hospital bed . Harold Macmillan , recuperating from his prostate operation and cranked up to a sitting position , wore blue and white pajamas . In such unlikely surroundings Elizabeth received Macmillan 's even more unlikely nomination for Prime Minister : Alexander Frederick Douglas-Home , Earl of Home , Baron Home , Baron Dunglass and Baron Douglas . <P> If Elizabeth was surprised , so were her subjects . After half an hour 's conversation with Macmillan the Queen returned to Buckingham Palace , passing through a waiting crowd at the gates . A few minutes later a black Humber approached along the Mall . The man in the rear seat was a stranger ; a private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aristocratically fair features of the man beside the driver were familiar enough . " It 's Lord Home ! " came the amazed shouts . " Astonishing ! " gasped Lord Beaverbrook 's Evening Standard . <P> Macmillan had reached back over years of blurring class lines to present Britain with a belted earl of a Prime Minister , an elegantly casual product of the cricket wickets of Eton , a toothy , grouse-shooting , extremely U member of the Establishment . Facing elections , he had placed his Conservative Party in the hands of a member of the House of Lords who has not had to run for elective office since he inherited his title twelve years ago . <P> Rusk for President . In selecting Home , Macmillan passed over three far more likely candidates : R. A. Butler , 60 , deputy to Britain 's last three Conservative Prime Ministers , rebuilder of Tory Party fortunes and everlasting heir apparent to the No. 1 post ; Lord Hailsham , 56 , the grandiloquent Minister for Science , who gaudily flipped his coronet into the ring , emotionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M.P. , in hopes of becoming P.M. ; and Reginald Maudling , 46 , the darling of the Conservative backbenches and brainy Chancellor of the Exchequer . An exact U.S. parallel of what Macmillan did would be impossible to draw ; the closest approximation would be if a seriously ill President Kennedy had passed over Vice President Lyndon Johnson , House Speaker John McCormack and Senate President protem Carl Hayden to install Secretary of State Dean Rusk in the White House-all without an election . <P> Macmillan 's choice was based at least in part on his will , but not on whim . It followed a week-long Conservative Party conference , plus the mysterious Tory ritual by which the visceral wishes of party members , great and small , are gathered , interpreted and closely read for omens.
