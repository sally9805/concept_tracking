" A man in politics can do a tremendous amount of good for a large number of people , " said Robert P. Layne - and thereupon gave up politics . Explaining that he hoped " to do good for far fewer people but on a more profound basis , " Layne , 31 , announced last week that in June he will quit his job as a Republican senator in the Kentucky legislature to study for the Episcopal priesthood at Virginia Theological Seminary . <P> Turning from things secular to sacred has plenty of precedents . Within the past decade , U.S. seminaries have been getting a striking and measurable increase in applications from men in their 30s and 40s who want to abandon successful secular careers in everything from baseball to business . About one-third of the candidates at Vanderbilt Divinity School are former business or professional men , including a 43-year-old Memphis lawyer , a 39-year-old trucking-firm vice president , a 38-year-old photographer . Three years ago , at the age of 37 , Rion Dixon was an executive of St. Louis ' International Shoe Co. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a Miami real-estate man ; now both are ministerial candidates at Columbia Theological Seminary ( Presbyterian ) in Decatur , Ga . <P> Something Was Missing . Although seminary deans keep on the watch for failures seeking to escape the hardships of life through the church , they find that most older men are genuinely responding to calls they can not escape . Layne , for example , spent three years wrestling with his decision . President Stuart LeRoy Anderson of the Pacific School of Religion observes that many applicants are " dissatisfied with whatever fields they are in because they deal only with materialistic things . They would rather give their lives to investigating the significance of life . " The Rev. William Clancey , once an assistant U.S. attorney in San Francisco , says : " I loved the law , but I knew something was missing . After one martini , the idea would come into my head , but I kept pushing it out . " He eventually stopped pushing , and at 35 began studying for the Episcopal priesthood . <P> One sign that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seminarians have taken up theological studies at considerable sacrifice of money or position . One of the few rich seminarians is the former president of a $1,000,000-a-year Detroit auto-parts firm who promoted himself to board chairman in order to study for the ministry at the Chicago Theological Seminary . " I 've had it so good that I thought I 'd devote the rest of my career to helping society in some way , " he says . <P> Better Rapport . Churches occasionally are reluctant to accept older ministers , concerned that they may be ready to retire by the time they have mastered their new profession . In the 1964 entering class at Maine 's Bangor Theological Seminary , a school that specializes in training men with " delayed vocations , " one student was in his 60s , another was 52 . Yet nonclerical experience often gives these men a rapport with their congregations that ministers straight out of college can not have . Methodist Preacher Russ Kemmerer , 33 , a moderately successful pitcher in the major leagues for nine years-mostly with the Boston Red Sox and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his church in Monrovia , Ind .
