THE FLAG WAVER A Story by HOWARD R. SIMPSON B EING American Vice Consul in Kabona had its advantages . 1 was my own boss and things were fairly quiet . There were few visitors and when they did come they did n't stay long . My reports were spaced far apart and did not tax the mind . The recurrent subject matter of peanut-crop volume and what the District Officer thought about our action at Suez had hardly kept the lights burning late in New State . All in all , I had learned to like Kabona . There was a certain aesthetic purity about the low silhouette of its mud buildings against the blood-red sun . The constantly wheeling vultures complemented this pimple of civilization in the broad desert as seagulls do a seascape . My bachelor needs were simple . I had a house-boy who saw to my laundry and cooking and occasionally made the gesture of sweeping the dust out of my small bungalow , which fortunately faced toward the desert and presented its windowless rear to the straggling edges of the town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was often called upon at the last minute to fill an empty seat at a British dinner party . My African friendsdropped in regularly to drink my duty-free whiskey and let off nationalist steam . It was quiet , if not pleasant , living , and I was able to read to my heart 's content . Then Lamboulis arrived . I had been out of town the morning he dropped by the office but my clerk had shown me his name in the American citizens ' register and given me the card he had left behind . It was an engraved card with many sweeps of fancy script . " John Lamboulis , " it read , " Local Agent for American Imports . " I questioned the clerk and found that Mr. Lamboulis had leased a large house not far from the center of town owned by a retired British major who had returned to England shortly after his wife had run off with an Italian construction engineer . My clerk , whose name was Festus , stood in the doorway while I examined the outsize calling card . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Festus volunteered before returning to his desk . Any new arrival in Kabona was an event . A new American was a special event . I made a mental note to call Mr. Lamboulis and invite him for a drink at the dub . Then I went back to work on my bimonthly report . Lamboulis , however , beat me to the punch . I picked up the buzzing desk phone , my mind still lost among the delicate balances of tribal population figures , and muttered a vague hello . The totally American inflection on the other end of the line came as a shock . I had n't realized how long I 'd been away . " Mr. Donovan ? This is John Lamboulis . How are ya ? " " Ah ... fine , fine . " I pushed my report aside and collected my thoughts . " Welcome to Ka-bona . " " Thanks , I guess I seen worse . " There was a long , awkward pause that I finally broke . " Say , I 'd like to have you over for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  hut the beer is good and it 's about all the town has to offer . " " That 's the reason I called you , " Lamboulis said . " How about coming over for dinner tomorrow night ? My wife do n't have all her gear but , what the hell , it 'll be better than this Limey chow . " " Sure , I 'd be glad to . " I put on my best public-relations voice . " I 'll be glad to talk to an American again . " " Yeah , " Lamboulis replied with no great enthusiasm , " I bet . We 'll expect you about eight , okay ? " " Fine , " I said , " see you then . " The next day my time was taken up with a long-distance call from the Consulate General and the work it involved . Some American missionary had run his 1949 Buick into the mud south of Buguri and he was afraid to leave it in the care of the local Fulani herdsmen . He had sent his assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in Kabona they had called the Consulate General in the capital . The Consulate General then had to call mc . This was always irritating as my superiors tried to make it appear that I had neglected my duty in some way when they were bothered with anything from my district . I finally persuaded the British Captain at Bugutu to send a Land Rover and some men to rescue the stranded missionary , and suddenly it was closing time and I remembered my dinner engagement . T H E house Lamboulis had leased was a low , flat cement block with the usual frosted louvered windows and a broad gravel driveway . There was still a red streak in the sky as I swung the Consulate Chevrolet into the parking circle and sent a colony of red-necked lizards scram- Howard R. Simpson  --  author of " To a Silent Valley , " a novel about the Viet Minh  --  served the U.S. State Department in Indochina and in Nigeria . Recently he has been U.S. cultural officer in southern France and press attach ? in Paris . bling over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white jacket bound tight around his waist by a red scarf greeted me at the door and took my coat . " Come in , come in , " Lamboulis bellowed from somewhere in the interior . He met me at the end of an entrance hall cluttered with packing crates and barrels . He shook hands with great vigor and , still clasping me by the right arm , pulled me behind him into the brightly lit living-room . " What 'll it be ? " he asked jovially , tossing his head toward an adequate display of bottles on a table near the window . " We got bourbon , Scotch , gin , and even some IP ouzo . " I 'll take a Scotch and soda . " He laughed and shook his finger at me . " You turning into a Limey or something ? You been out here too long . Here , have a good American bourbon. " 1 watched him as he poured the drinks . He was younger than I had expected and heavy-set with short-cropped black hair . He had thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottles and glasses . I had noticed his eyes when he greeted me . They were dark and soft . They did n't seem to go with his outwardly tough appearance . He turned to hand me the bourbon and the look of distaste on my face must have been so strong that his mouth fell open and he hesitated . " Jesus ! " lie said seriously , " you really do n't like the stuff . You would rather have Scotch ! " His eyebrows came together in a repentant frown . " I 'm sorry , " he said , shaking his head . " Here , I 'll knock together a Scotch . " His sincere regret was embarrassing . " Do n't bother , " I said lightly , " this is fine . " " No , no , here . " He handed me a new drink and pushed the offending glass of bourbon and soda behind the other bottles . " Let 's sit down , " he suggested ; " the wife will be here in a minute . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lumpy , straw-filled blue pillows . The night was cool and quiet . The rich yellow lights of tiny fireflies danced outside the open windows and the ceiling fan creaked slowly overhead . We exchanged polite conversation . He asked me how long I 'd been in Kabona and I took the opportunity to give him a quick rundown of the town , its leading citizens , and what was available in the way of entertainment . Then I waited fur him to tell me of his business . He was slow in starting . First he spoke of the trip on the ship and the stopover in Rome . But once he did start on his plans , there was no stopping him . He spoke of the possibilities for expanding commercial trade in the region . He felt that any American installing himself now would be in an ideal position when independence came and the market was taken out of the hands of the British . He planned to start in a small way . He had several contracts with British and American firms . Nothing on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods , and what he considered a surefire money-maker  --  hair-straightener manufactured by a small company in Harlem . He bubbled over with his plans and enthusiasm to such an extent that I was beginning to feel tired . I was only too pleased when his wife came in from the kitchen . She was attractive but plump . She had dimples on each side of her generous mouth and her black hair was caught in a thick bun . Good humor twinkled in her eyes . She wiped her hands on her apron before shaking my hand . She broughtt the smells of the kitchen with her and , for once , they were pleasant odors redolent of spices and garlic , and my taste buds , long dulled on boiled potatoes , Brussels sprouts , and overdone beef , were already vibrating in anticipation . She sat with its for a round al drinks , laughing often , showing what seemed to me an abundant cleavage . Let me say here that my sex life had been quite limited since my posting to Kabona . Not extinct , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we took our places at a long table . Several small , silk American flags , the type usually made in japan , formed the centerpiece and I felt that Lamboulis had done this as a special gesture to mark my visit . The dinner lived up to my expectations . Working with limited resources in a kitchen that lacked most of its utensils , Mrs. Lamboulis produced the finest meal I could remember having eaten in Kabona . Lamboulis beamed with pride throughout the dinner . We feasted on a thick broth , blazing with pepper , a lamb pilaff accompanied by stuffed eggplant , and a bowl of salad made from tinned green beans but flavored with olive oil , vinegar , and garlic . All of this we washed down with bottle after bottle of chilled Danish beer . Lamboulis apologized for the lack of wine but said he expected a shipment of claret within the week . Later , over coffee and cognac , Lamboulis spoke of his first impressions of Kabona and asked me about the British District Officer . It soon became obvious that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these poor Africans , " he said , staring out into the desert night , " I ca n't help but think how they been pushed around all these years . " I watched him carefully , trying to sense his character and feelings , but the more he spoke , the more my heart sank . I could see trouble ahead . Do n't get - me wrong . I 'm all for freedom . I think independence is the greatest gift humanity can receive but during my time in Kabona I had come across too many do-gooders and na  --  ve tourist types who felt they and they alone had come to Africa to liberate the " natives . " With a name like Donovan , I certainly did n't favor the British , but after living in Africa for a while I was willing to concede them certain points . Lamboulis was not . " Lousy Limey bastards , " he mumbled as we had our second cognac . " I bet they already hate my guts . " I started to protest but he continued . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 're coming in . We 'll show these people what it means to be free . Uncle Sam wo n't let ' em down ! " I had an uneasy feeling that Lamhoulis ' anti-British psychosis had already become a stone around my neck but the excellent meal , the cognac , and the jovial presence of his bountiful wife dulled my apprehension . When I said good night and drove home , I was in the best of spirits . T H R E E days later I was sitting on the small veranda in front of my bungalow picking at a lunch thrown together by my house-boy . He had dumped cold tinned salmon onto a withered lettuce leaf and crowned it with a gob of flaccid mayonnaise that was fast separating in the heat . It was easier to eat without looking at this mixture and I was concentrating on a smudged copy of Life magazine when the District Officer drove up and disentangled himself from his Land Rover . Robert Boggs was the antithesis of what one imagined a British District Officer to be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy noon air like the blunt prow of a garbage scow . His British-style , beltless trousers hung low on his hips , and bare , pink flesh peeked through the gaps between his straining shirt buttons . Sandy hair curled low on his neck and steel-rimmed spectacles magnified his small blue eyes until they resembled the liquid , unseeing orbs of some strange sea animal . Despite his appearance , Boggs was efficient and his habitual sloppiness was overlooked in favor of his handling of the District . He and I got along well and had even reached the point where we occasionally loaned each other underclothing when our houseboys fell behind on their washing , a true sign of confidence and mutual esteem in a British Colony . Boggs waved his chubby hand and squinted as he climbed the three stairs to the veranda . He dropped himself into a chair , threw back his head , and shouted for beer at the top of his lungs . " Make yourself at home , " I chided him . " Thanks , V.C. , bloody kind of you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houseboy came out with a bottle of beer and a glass mug for Boggs . He quickly gulped several swallows and wiped the loam front his lips with the back of his hand . " Have n't much time . Must rush off . " He threw out brief sentences between gulps . " You 've met this Greek chap ? " " He 's not Greek , he 's American . " " Oh , hell , let 's not get technical . Looks bloody well Greek to me ! " " All right , Robbie , " I said , irritated , " he may look Greek to you but he 's an American citizen . " Boggs took off his glasses and wiped them on his shirttail . " Regardless , " he said , pouring the last of the bottle into the mug , " I do think it 's a bit thick , all this . " " What 's a bit thick ? " " The bloody flagpole ! Going to be a headache for me . Bloody great balloon will go up if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Right in front of his house . Not really even his house . Poor old Major Hudgins would go toddy if he knew , Not right , you know , V.C. , wish you 'd do something about it . " " Lamboulis has put up a flagpole ? " " Saw it this morning , white and straight . Even the Hausa traders stop to look . Stars and bars flying . . . " " Stars and stripes , " I corrected him . " Hell , what 's the difference ? Not the Union Jack , I bloody well assure you ! " He paused to finish the last of his bccr . He looked me in the eye . " Not right , you know , " he said solemnly , " against the regs and all that . " I saw Lamboulis that afternoon . Being as tactful as possible , I explained that one did not raise foreign flags willy-nilly over foreign residences in a British Colony . I could tell he took it quite personally . He was hurt . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a beer but he did n't invite me inside . We stood there awk-88 THE FLAG WAVER wardly on the gravel , the flagpole before us and the flag hanging limp on its halyard . " Okay , " he finally said , sighing , " so , I 'll take it down . " And he walked to the pole , loosened the rope , and let Old Glory come down slowly . His actions had all the gravity of an Arlington ceremony . When he gathered the folds in his arms I was touched . I felt guilty . We said good-by and his " Good-by , Mr. Donovan " was dripping with reproach and finality . Next morning Festus told me the flagpole had come down and that Lamboulis ' houseboy was sawing it into sections for fence posts . I DID N'T see Lamboulis again for some time . He and his wife had gone to the capital on business and in the general excitement of preparing for the Governor General 's visit to Kabona , the problem of Lamboulis slipped from my mind . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my part in the Governor General 's visit was to be small , but I had been invited to all the official receptions , ceremonies , and dinners and I was hard put to find enough white shirts to carry me through . The Consulate General was also anxious to know how the old boy 's visit would go over with the local populace , so I was prepared to keep my eves and ears open . The Governor General was a kindly old man , fond of strict protocol , port , and Scottish reels . He seemed to realize that he was one of the last colonial Governor Generals still in business and he made a special effort to surround his position with all the fanfare required . Among the local population he was known as " bear with bird head " because of his lumbering corpulence and the traditional feather-plumed helmet that never seemed to leave his head . Poor Boggs worked hard . His Land Rover shot around town from club to residence and from railroad to playing field . He poured perspiration and he was forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell local emirs it would be better if they did n't bring all of their wives to the reception . I felt sorry for him and I almost offered to help but I knew he would resent any interference . I kept quiet and had my houseboy put two sets of clean underwear aside as I knew Boggs was sure to find himself short at the last moment . The day the Governor General arrived was one of the hottest we had had . The sky hung like molten lead over the desert and not the slightest trace of breeze stirred the robes of the mounted Hausa warriors drawn up beside the railway station . Boggs had marshaled his forces well . Thelong line of mounted Hausas stretched from . the rail station into the town . At the risk of sounding romantic , 1 must say they were impressive . Their nervous , thin-flanked horses were hung with rich embroidery and the spade blades of their spears shone in the morning sun . Cross-hilted broadswords in leather sheaths were slung across their backs and the emirs ' saddles were decorated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African Rifles was drawn up in front of the station . The riflemen were tall northerners in khaki shorts , vest-like red jackets , and fezzes squared on their shaven heads . Their short British bayonets matched the Hausa spears , sparkling in the merciless sun . I was standing with the officials . I had shaken the required number of hands and exchanged small talk and now I paused to mop my brow . Boggs hounded to my side , sweat patches showing through his white jacket . " Should be here soon . Hottest damn day since Omdurman . Got any ice in your frig ? " " I think there arc a couple of trays . " " Good , bring them along later to the reception . The ice I bought last night is going down my bathtub drain like bloody Niagara . " A long , thin whistle sounded down the track and those on the platform stirred in anticipation . The young British officer in command of the troops bless ' his nose , stuffed his handkerchief back in his pocket , and called his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring straight into the desert , their horses shifting uneasily under them . The train came into sight . The engine was festooned with British flags . Coughs of white smoke erupted from the smokestack as the engine chugged slowly toward the station , Boggs took his place on the platform . 1 could see steam forming on the lenses of his spectacles and perspiration coursed down his thick neck . The engine pulled opposite us and for several seconds the officials exchanged glances with the bored African engineer who was nonchalantly exploring one nostril with his forefinger . Then the Governor General 's car came into full view and we could see movement within . " Should have a bloody band , " I heard Boggs mumble before he went to the car 's stairs to greet the Governor General . The local chiefs and emirs crowded close behind him , elbowing each other out of the way , their white teeth bared in broad smiles of welcome . The Governor General climbed down from his car , saluted , and shook Boggs 's damp hand . He did look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stiff white collar of his uniform . The medals on his chest tinkled like Christmas tree ornaments as he shook hands with the emirs . Boggs guided him down the line and opposite me . " Mr. Donovan , the American Vice Consul , " Boggs shouted over the noise of the crowd and the hiss of steam from the engine . The Governor General 's blue eyes crossed mine for a second . We shook hands . He twitched his mustache in what I imagined was meant for a smile and uttered a sound that I could only presume was a greeting . Then they were off , on down the reception line , and I was only too glad to get back to my car and head into town . I drove toward Boggs 's residence where the reception was to he held . Suddenly I remembered the ice . Cursing , I turned back toward my bungalow . By the time I had emptied the ice from the trays and found something to carry it in , the official cortege had left the station . As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the high-pitched shouting of school children massed in front of Boggs 's driveway . I swung out of the main line of traffic and took a side street . I parked and managed to get to Boggs 's kitchen just as the official party arrived in the house . I turned the ice over to his boy . When I walked out of the kitchen the Governor General and his party were established in the living-room and the house was a crush of guests . The Governor General looked purple and I wondered if he were going to survive the reception . I was about to accept a gin and tonic from a passing tray when Boggs grabbed me roughly by the arm . " Bloody filthy trick , Donovan , " he snapped reproachfully . " I thought you were my friend . " He looked like he was about to die of apoplexy . I was dumfounded . " What . . . ? " I stammered . " GovGen 's about to boil me in oil , that 's what ! Ruined his whole visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ! Who did it ? " " Who did what ? " Boggs ground his teeth and his eyes bulged . " The flags , daunt it ! " he shouted , his arms flailing . " Greatest ball-up yctl " he muttered as lie left me . By this time 1 was thoroughly unsettled . I pushed my way through to the front dour . The school children were dispersing , their tiny ebony heads in brilliant contrast with their spotless white school uniforms . Then I noticed the splashes of color . Each child was carrying a small flag . At first I thought they were Union Jacks . Then , with a shock I recognized the familiar stripes and the blue field with its white stars . Suddenly I felt a great need for that gin and tonic . I4 AMBOULIS was taking a shower when I reached his home and I had to wait on the veranda . By the time he came out I was fuming . " Hi , " he said casually , wrapping his terry-cloth robe around himself and looking surprised to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Listen , Lamboulis , " I said , trying to control myself , " this has gone far enough ! " His thick eyebrows formed an arch of surprise . " Do n't get you . " " Those flags . The kids had American flags today . You 're the only one who could have ... " He waved his arm , laughing . " Oh hell , just thought I 'd help out . No harm done . " This was too much . For a moment I forgot I was a Vice Consul of the United States . " God dammit ! " I shouted . " You listen to me ! Everything has gone fine here up to now and I wo n't tolerate you starting trouble ! " It was as if I had hit him with a sledge hammer . His flippancy disappeared . His soft brown eyes clouded and - for a minute I almost thought he was going to cry . 1 calmed down considerably . " Look , Lamboulis , were in this together . We 're the only Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any wounds . I can understand it if you do n't Like the British . But you 're making it hard for me . " He seemed to be thinking . He nodded his head in reply . " If they wanted to they could put you on a plane out of here tomorrow , " I continued , " and I would n't be able to do anything about it . " I was beginning to get angry again but 1 controlled myself . " I 'm almost at the end of my tour here , " I told him , " and I do n't intend to let you or anyone else ruin my last few months . " He glanced at me sheepishly . I saw a little of the old flippancy returning . " Okay , boss , " he said sighing , " it wo n't happen again . " " It better not , " 1 replied . " Good-by , " and I strode back to my car . I had a disagreeable series of apologies to make before Boggs 's ceremonial dinner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I received no rockets from the Consulate General , so I presumed he had forgotten the incident . It took Boggs a full month to forget the American infiltration of his Governor General 's reception . Even then I could sense that it would never be the same again between Boggs and me . Lamboulis ' business seemed to be going well enough and Festus informed me that he had recently been authorized as the local representative for Becks Beer . I ONLY had two more months to go before home leave and reassignment and I could n't seem to concentrate on local problems . My mind built dream castles of the trip home and I pictured myself carousing in Paris and spinning broad tales of my African experiences in Washington . The Consul General finally decided that I should come down to the capital for a few days of consultation and I left Kabona in high spirits , looking forward to at least one evening in an air-conditioned night club with one of the American secretaries from the Consulate General . The consultation lasted three days and I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't live up to my expectations . The secretary did not accept certain of my proposals in good grace and I spent much too much money . The morning of my third day in the capital I actually felt homesick for Kahona . Luck was with me and I ran into a friend of mine in the bar of the Olympic Hotel that noon . He was a West African Airways pilot with the improbable name of Duncan MacDuff . After three pink gins he invited me to fly north with him . He was ferrying a new army observation plane to Buguri and he dreaded the long , dull trip alone . We had another pink gin to prepare us for lunch . We then worked our way through a greasy ground-nut stew , the pride of the Olympic 's chef . MacDuff got the flimsy aircraft off the ground at 2:00 P.M. and I managed to join him in some discordant singing as soon as he reached his altitude and pointed the plane 's nose toward the north . After the singing we tried some conversation but the washing-machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon gave up and settled back with my eyes closed . It seemed I had been asleep a very short time when Mac-Duff poked my arm and I pushed myself upright , rubbing my eyes . We were banking in a wide swing . I saw the vague outlines of mud buildings below and I suddenly realized we must be over Kabona , " Kabona , " MacDuff shouted as the ground spun beneath us . He steadied the plane and came in low over the town . I was yawning deeply when he shouted again and began waving his arm . He put the small aircraft into another wide turn . I looked at him , puzzled . Buguri was still some distance away and we had to make the strip before sundown . I could n't understand why he should want to swing back over Kahona . He cut down our speed and leaned toward me . " I want to show you something ! " he shouted . He dropped a bit lower and pointed down below us . I loosened my seat belt and strained forward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a broad roof that looked vaguely familiar and suddenly a colorful pattern emerged . The late afternoon sun accentuated the colors anti clearly defined the red , white , and blue flowers that formed a precise rectangular design be-low us . The blue field , the stripes , it was all there . " Who the hell has done that ? " MacDuff shouted , I did n't answer him . I just stared , feeling my blood pressure mount . " Bloody Yankee cheek ! " MacDuff said shaking his head angrily . As we flew on I turned and looked over my shoulder . I could n't be positive but I thought I could see the tiny squat figure of Lamboulis watering his masterpiece in the fading light . Harper 's Magazine , August 1962
