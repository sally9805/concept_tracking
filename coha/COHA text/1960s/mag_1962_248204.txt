With his Savile Row suits and ingratiating manner , spare , handsome William John Christopher Vassall liked to move about Britain 's nicer resorts , impressing elderly ladies and retired colonels as an outwardly gay blade who was really some sort of secret agent . Trouble was , nobody realized just how gay he was-or , for that matter , how secret . Last week Vassall , 38. was convicted in London 's Old Bailey of passing British Admiralty secrets to the Russians for six years , rather than risk exposure as a homosexual . <P> Chalk Circles . Son of the Anglican curate of Piccadilly 's fashionable St. James 's Church , Vassall was a lower-echelon Admiralty clerk with talents so mediocre he had been passed over for promotion seven years running . He was also , said his defense attorney in a plea for mitigation , a man with " a weakness which has been with him ever since he came into this life . " His weakness did not get him into real trouble until 1955 , when he was with the British naval attache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a Pole , Vassall recalled , " I was plied with very strong brandy , " and soon he found himself engaging in " several compromising actions " on a divan with " two or three " other men . Having thoughtfully filmed the occasion , Soviet intelligence agents then smoothly blackmailed Vassall with the pictures . <P> Sent back to London in 1956 , he regularly gave his Soviet embassy contacts copies of Admiralty documents . He arranged some meetings by drawing a chalk circle on the trunk of a plane tree , others by dialing Kensington 8955 and asking for " Miss Mary . " Last May British counterspies finally caught on , and in September he was arrested with 140 photos of Admiralty documents whose exposure , in the court 's words , " would gravely damage the State 's security . " <P> High Living Standard . The mystery was what took them so long . On $49 a week , Vassall lived in a comfortable Pimlico flat whose proudest ornament was an antique , $1,000 Queen Anne wardrobe . He had 100 silk ties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Admiralty did , the Russians helped maintain his high living standard . " He was trapped by lust , " said Attorney General Sir John Hobson , " and cash kept him a prisoner . " Vassall , pleading guilty to four counts of espionage , drew an 18-year sentence . <P> Coming only six months after a government committee had urged a severe tightening of security procedures , the Vassall affair shook the government . Prime Minister Macmillan responded by ordering a three-man panel of civil servants to report by year 's end how Vassall could have spied for so long without being caught , and whether there was any negligence by those who hired him . <P> <P> Also upset , though for a different reason , was an elderly widow named Mrs. Norah Reeve , who recently moved into a new apartment-no one seemed quite sure just who occupied it before . After Vassall 's confession was published in the dailies , her phone rang incessantly , she complained , but it was always somebody asking for " Miss Mary .
