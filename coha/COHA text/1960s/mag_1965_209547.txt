The soft , dark grey substance that geologists call " quick clay " is composed primarily of small flaky particles and a great deal of water . It contains very little of the electrolytic salts that tend to bind normal soil particles together . <P> All of which means that the slippery stuff has another distinctive characteristic : it is thixotropic-a sudden shock can transform it from a solid to a liquid . <P> Residents of Anchorage , Alaska , saw a dramatic demonstration of that strange phenomenon during the disastrous 1964 earthquake , says Columbia University Geologist Paul Kerr , whose investigation is described in the current issue of Scientific American . While probing beneath the battered sand , gravel and silt surface of Anchorage during the past two summers , Kerr studied an underlying layer of quick clay from 10 to 30 ft. thick . During the three minutes of the quake 's violent up-and-down jolting , he concluded , some of the quick clay under Anchorage turned into liquid , triggering the damaging landslides that literally floated large sections of land to new locations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineers are experimenting with a technique already used in Norway : forcing electrodes into the layer of clay and passing high-amperage currents between the electrodes to reorient the clay particles . Scientists are also conducting laboratory experiments that could some day put Anchorage on more solid ground . By pumping enough calcium salts into the clay to bind its particles together by electrolytic action , they hope to make the clay more viscous , resistant to shock and no longer thixotropic.
