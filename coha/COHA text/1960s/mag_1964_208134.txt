I Had a Ball is a misaddressed musical mailbag . Buddy Hackett , a droll fellow of manic and mournful mien , should be readdressed to oldtime burlesque , where his earthy urbanisms could blue the air like cigar smoke . The frenetically agitated dances should be restored to the speeded-up silent film . The nondescript music should be sent back to recompose itself . The book has never left its natural state-pulp . <P> The inanimate star of the evening is Sam , a crystal ball that tells the future incorrectly . Hackett , a Coney Island sharper turned pseudo-Freudian mind-sweeper , has great faith in Sam ( " it comes from Bombay , the farfetched East " ) . Under Hackett 's lunatic gaze , Sam 's face turns red , as well it might , since in Act I the crystal ball mismatches two pairs of lovers : an arm-twisting loan shark ( Steve Roland ) with a taffy-sweet Ferris-wheel operator ( Karen Morrow ) , and a glib but honest-hearted Coney barker ( Richard Kiley ) with a roundheeled golddigger ( Luba Lisa ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baddies and the goodies mate up . <P> Since plot is nought , Ball relies on Buddy Hackett for a nightlong transfusion of comic relief . He can fire a salvo of laughter with the whites of his eyes , and step on a dud line so that it explodes , but he has to work so hard to be playful that it kills the fun . Apart from Hackett , only Luba Lisa comes out of this Coney Island carnage with talent and personality arrestingly intact . Moving like a sexy-hexy wind-up doll , with the voice of a Jewish Chatty Cathy and the body of Salome , she gives the impression of being cheerfully in debt to the whole male race as she waits for the next man to garnishee her itsy-bitsy , teeny-weeny , pom-pom green intime bikini .
