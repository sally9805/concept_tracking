Disarmament is impossible in the foreseeable future . Everyone knows this except a few sentimentalists . Yet West , East and neutrals continue the solemn game of pretending that some sort of disarmament deal can be reached . The harm of the game , to the West , is that it fosters illusions . The advantage is that more and more it shows up the Russians as phony champions of peace . <P> With only a few days to go before the U.S. launches its nuclear test series at Christmas Island , the Russians at Geneva last week continued the game by trying every conceivable stalling tactic to postpone the tests . At the 17-nation disarmament parley , Chief Soviet Delegate Valerian Zorin insisted that the U.S. delay at least until after Easter . U.S. Delegate Arthur Dean recalled that the Russian had already violated one moratorium with their huge tests last fall . Said he : " We will not be burned twice by the same fire . " <P> Useless Compromise . Moscow could still stop the Pacific blasts with a stroke of the pen-by signing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time and again the Russians have refused to do so . Nevertheless , the eight " middlemen " at the conference ( Brazil , Burma , Egypt , Ethiopia , India , Mexico , Nigeria and Sweden ) also played the game by weighing in with a " compromise " plan of their own that would leave it up to individual countries to " invite " foreign inspectors to investigate suspicious explosions . It was a system tailor-made for nuclear cheating . Zorin and the Communists liked it ; Dean and the West most emphatically did not . <P> The West last week made the most massive and earnest move yet when Delegate Dean laid before the conference the U.S. 's exhaustive blueprint for what the experts call ' G. &C."-general; and complete disarmament . Months in the making , the plan was just what President Kennedy called it : " The most comprehensive and specific series of proposals the U.S. or any other country has ever made on disarmament . " <P> Goldwater 's Case . It envisages three stages of phased arms reduction , eventually eliminating national armies altogether.The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time limit was set for the third and last stage . There is specific provision for inspection and control to prevent cheating , but to minimize Russia 's fear of " spies " in the guise of inspectors , the plan introduces the new concept of zonal inspection , or sampling ( TIME , March 23 ) , to check treaty compliance on a random basis . Successive stages of the plan would be supervised by a U.N . disarmament organization ( ultimately responsible to the Security Council ) . Eventually a U.N . " peace force " would wield all military power in the world except for minor law-enforcement units that each nation needs to maintain internal order . <P> The plan will obviously remain wildly Utopian as long as the U.N . and the world remain divided . Senator Barry Goldwater expressed misgivings : " I suggest that the American people would rise up in indignant protest if we were to open our defense installations to inspection by United Nations teams , and eventually turn over our security to a U.N . peace force .
