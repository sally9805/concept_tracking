The most radically redesigned typewriter since the introduction of the first practical electric model 40 years ago was put on sale last week by International Business Machines . The product of ten years ' work by IBM 's engineering staff and Industrial Designer Eliot Noyes , the new machine types faster and is far simpler to handle than conventional models , which IBM hopefully predicts will soon be as obsolete as quill pens . <P> The " Selectric , " as it is called , is shaped like an ordinary typewriter , but its carriage does not move , nor do the keys extend into levers that make the impression on paper . Instead , the Selectric has mounted inside its case a spherical-shaped , pingpong-ball-sized metal typing element bearing all the familiar 88 alphabetical characters , numerals and punctuation symbols . When the typist strikes the keyboard , the typewriter 's motor rapidly tilts and rotates the element on its axis as it moves across the paper , bringing the proper character into position for printing . The element is then rocked against ribbon and paper to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used by the Dow-Jones business-news ticker and the old Hammond typewriter . <P> On the Selectric , only .0655 of a second elapses from the striking of a key to the printing of a letter . On existing machines , the typist often types such familiar letter combinations as t-h-e faster than the machine can record them , thus causing skipped letters . To prevent this , the Selectric has a " storage " system that holds the second letter in common combinations for a fraction of a second until it can be printed . <P> Unlike other typewriters , the Selectric is not stuck with one permanent type face . Typists can change type styles in a matter of seconds by opening the machine 's cover and replacing one typing element with another bearing one of the six different type faces supplied by IBM . Typing ribbons come in plastic cartridges that snap into place and do not have to be threaded on reels by the typist . Paper is inserted by being placed against the roller , which automatically feeds it into the machine with the pressing of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11-in. model and a 15-in. model . Prices : $395 and $445 . Present IBM machines currently sell for $440.
