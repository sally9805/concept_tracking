Between major works Jean-Luc Godard , like Graham Greene , composes entertainments . Pierrot Le Fou , made in 1965 but just released in the U.S. , has little of the celebrated Godardian resonance . There are no impalements of the future , as in Alphaville or Weekend , nor is there much of the mordant social satire of La Chinoise or Les Carabineers . Godard himself feels that the film is merely " life filling the screen as a tap fills a bathtub that is simultaneously emptying at the same rate . " <P> Godard is partly right ; wanton flow is the film 's main source of entertainment . But the melodramatic sluice-of-life interludes-based on Lionel White 's novel Obsession-are what ultimately swamp the film 's modest blend of whimsy and melancholy . <P> After a hollow , hilarious party at which the guests talk only in the language of commercials , a television director named Ferdinand ( Jean-Paul Belmondo ) decides that he needs his baby sitter more than his children do . With her in tow , he ricochets from Paris to the Riviera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . He gets his wish : what begins as a fable of ennui ends as a parable of evil . <P> The baby sitter , Marianne ( Anna Karina ) was once the petite amie of gunrunners . Along the trek she cuts one midget ex-associate dead by blithely plunging scissors into his neck ; eventually she runs off with another smuggler . Ferdinand finds the violence catching and , in an explosive finale , he erases all points of the triangle . <P> Lyce Level . In his most recent films , Godard has overemphasized polemic at the cost of the cast . In Weekend , for example , windy politics fray some of the film 's visionary power . But in Pierrot Le Fou Godard shows that he can coax fine actors into superlative performances . Belmondo earns his lunatic ( fou ) sobriquet ; his quirky bantam strut and broken-nosed banter are only a gasp away from Breathless . Karina 's sensuality gives her ultimate villainy the quality of revelation . <P> Unfortunately , Godard is no longer able to make a movie without making a movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the characters ' portentous addresses to the camera . Godard too often stops the motion to zero in on words within words-as when he finds " vie " in Riviera . And his shrill anti-Americanism is strictly on the lyce level , mocking such easy and oversized targets as Coca-Cola and chewing gum . <P> He does omit one American target , however . At one point , Karina sets the theme of the movie by telling the tale of the man who had a brush with death and fled , only to meet it in his flight . Throughout the film , Godard leaves a trail of authors ' names : Robert Louis Stevenson , William Faulkner , Jack London , Raymond Chandler . One name he fails to drop is that of the man who made the legend famous by basing a whole novel on it . He is John O'Hara , and his book was Appointment in Samarra.
