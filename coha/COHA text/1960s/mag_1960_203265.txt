Hawaiian sugar growers have long been in an uncomfortably tight box . Their per-acre yields make them the most efficient producers in the world , but their high labor costs and long sea haul to market restrict them to selling in the high-priced , protected U.S. market . There , growth possibilities are virtually nil owing to 1 ) the public 's fondness for dieting , 2 ) Government quotas on sales by foreign and domestic sugar producers . <P> Even though Congress threatens to slash Cuba 's sugar quota in reprisal for Fidel Castro 's seizure of U.S. property , Hawaii is in no position to step up its production to benefit . So , last week , Hawaii 's leading sugar company , American Factors , Ltd. , announced a plan that it hopes will help it break out of its box . It set up a new organization called Sugar International* to equip other countries with a Hawaiian-style sugar industry . <P> While per-capita sugar consumption in developed countries has leveled off or even declined , it is soaring in the rapidly developing countries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first spotted two years ago by President Boyd MacNaughton , 51 , of Hawaii 's second largest sugar company , C. Brewer &; Co. , Ltd. , which arranged to design and operate a 25,000-acre sugar plantation for Iran . Said MacNaughton : " If we want to grow and expand in the sugar business , we have to do it outside Hawaii and the U.S. " Into the Sudan . Both Sugar International and Brewer are seeking a go-ahead from the four-year-old Republic of the Sudan to set up a joint U.S.-Sudanese privately owned sugar industry estimated to cost $25 million . The sugar plantation and mill would also set a free enterprise beacon in a key area of Africa . Many Sudanese leaders lean toward a state-owned industry , are being encouraged in that direction by the offer of easy credits from Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia . <P> But the U.S. State Department feels it is so important to show the Sudan a successful private enterprise industry that it is arranging to fly a delegation of government leaders to Hawaii to see how U.S. methods produce 88 tons of sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sugar International thinks that opportunities to set up new sugar industries are virtually unlimited , is studying prospects in Jordan , Ghana , Kenya , Angola , Tanganyika and Uganda . <P> Trouble in Paradise . Few Hawaiians ever thought they would see the day when sugar planters would want-or need-to look beyond their own verdant cane fields . In the old days , sugar planters dominated Hawaii 's economic , political and social life . But in the last 20 years , sugar 's share of the Hawaiian gross product dropped from 21% to 8% . <P> The planters ' hold was further loosened in 1945-46 , when the International Longshoremen 's and Warehousemen 's Union organized the plantations and mills and conducted a successful 79-day strike . There was a four-month strike in 1958 , and today Hawaiian growers pay the highest annual wage scale in the sugar world ( $15.63 a day v. $3.80 in Puerto Rico ) . But there is a compensation : the union cooperates to eliminate unnecessary jobs through early retirement and even repatriation of late-arriving Filipino immigrants . Result : the Hawaiian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production workers are needed to turn out more sugar than 55,000 produced prewar .
