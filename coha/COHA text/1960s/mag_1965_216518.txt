American railroads are still a long way from consolidating into two or three giant lines that would blanket the nation , but the trend is clearly in that direction . There have been 35 rail mergers since 1957 , and a dozen mergers are now pending . Last week the Chicago &; North Western and the Chicago , Milwaukee St. Paul &; Pacific , which have been eying each other ever since 1939 , finally decided that one can live more cheaply than two . The estimated saving from sharing their facilities and eliminating duplicating service : about $40 million annually . <P> If stockholders go along with the directors ' decision , the proposed Chicago , <P> Milwaukee &; North Western Transportation Co. will rank among the top two or three roads in the U.S.-a system with nearly 21,000 miles of track , annual revenues of $450 million and assets of $1.3 billion . Since the Interstate Commerce Commission generally has looked favorably on recent rail mergers , it is expected to give its approval to the union . <P> One of the new road 's chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is North Western 's chairman , Ben Heineman , 51 , who is almost certain to become the new line 's chairman and chief executive officer . In his nine years at the controls of the North Western , he has engineered it from an antiquated , dying road that was losing more than $5,000,000 a year into a lean , modern line that has earned profits of more than $8,000,000 in each of the past two years . Spurning Government subsidies , Heineman has employed modern technology-from computers to helicopters-to cut his expenses and win back business from the highways . He led the fight against railroad featherbedding , enduring a costly strike and winning labor contracts that have set an industry pattern . Urged to abandon the North Western 's commuter operation-which was losing $2,500,000 annually-he instead modernized equipment , advertised for passengers . Last year his road earned the nation 's only commuter profit , $706,000 . <P> Heineman is already looking beyond creation of the Milwaukee &; North Western . He is fighting the Union Pacific for control of the Rock Island , is awaiting ICC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His goal : a 30,000-mile railroad that would stretch from Lake Superior to the Gulf of Mexico and from Chicago to the Pacific Ocean . Such a road would be second in mileage only to the Soviet Union 's state-owned , 79,000-mile system .
