In the South , along the 1,200-mile space crescent , the disordered legacy of antebellum culture is being buried in a shroud of scientific busyness There , enlightenment can no longer be defined as a willingness to compromise on language , making it " nigra " instead of " nigger . " The social impact of the aerospace industrial renaissance demands much more . So , strong is this force for change that at certain points along the crescent race relations , education and standards of living are being improved and upgraded to an extent and at a pace never before equaled , in the South . But happening also is a development that ' was certain to come about in a society so heavily freighted with technological talent . Elite ghettos of intellect are rising in the crescent , and from them springs a tendency to equate scientific sophistication with cultural eminence . Such ghettos are death to fusty mores , but they engender instead an atmosphere of almost , frightening dehumanization . William S. Ellis has been a reporter on papez s in Montana , Oklahoma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became a free-lance journalist , and his articles have appeared in Harpers , The New York Times , The Reporter and elsewhere . This is the second of three articles which Mr. Ellis wrote while on a grant from the Philip M. Stern Family Fund . By concentrating much of its activity in the crescent  --  the area extends from Houston to the east coast of Florida , and from New Prleans to northern Alabama the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has placed itself in a position to accelerate the integration process by economic pressure . NASA people deny that this is part of the agency 's goal or responsibility , but of all the " spin-off " benefits of the space program none is more profound than social reform . Nevertheless , NASA is reluctant to associate itself publicly witht , these matters . Like a certain elder statesman at a Republican convention , the agency seems to believe that to be noncommittal is to be virtuous . Major reforms are taking place , nevertheless , and NASA , however tacitly , is behind them . " Pressure by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said a young engineer who had been sent by Boeing from Seattle to . the George C. Marshall Space Flight , Center in Huntsville , Ala . While waiting for his family ? to arrive from the Northwest , he was living in the Huntsville YMCA , along with a dozen other , highly skilled technicians . It has been said that if the residents of that one small " Y " got together , they could : build and launch a satellite , 1 and then interpret its movements in ten different languages . " Even if ' t. that press , ure is n't stated , " he added , " it 's certainly implied . Remember , Wallace is n't much of a hero in this part of Alabama . " Indeed , if there is one section of the nation where Governor George Wallace has met nothing but frustrations and cutting ridiculei , it is in his , own state  --  in Huntsville and most of Madison County . For instance , when the Governor attempted by force to block integration of Huntsville 's public schools and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a group of white mothers pushed through the police cordon and kept the schools open . And whereas they may have expected to be greeted with kisses blown from beneath flowering dogvvoods and magnolias , the troopers were peppered with stinging taunts . Within twenty-four hours , they had packed up their riot equipment and left the city . Wallace struck back with the charge that one of the aerospace companies in Huntsville ( Brown Engineering , a prime contractor with NASA ) had been ordered by the government to hire a certain percentage of Negroes . Milton E. Cummings , president of the company , denies that , and so do officials at the Space Flight Center . Certainly if such a quota  --  a figure of 20 per cent of the work force was mentioned  --  was ever laid down , it has yet to be filled Few Negroes in Alabama  --  or elsewhere , for that matter  --  are trained for the type of technical work in which Brown Engineering and most other space-related industries engage When one who is qualified comes to notice , he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of enlightenment . There is thus an irony in the impact of the aerospace industry on race relations in the South . Discrimination is fading in the presence of the superior intellect upon which space work depends , but the high plane on - which equality is being offered makes it all but impossible for the average Southern Negroto participate . He is being told , in effect , to shake off his bonds today and present his Ph.D certificate tomorrow Ask one of those encamped in these new , brainy ghettos if he would want his sister to marry a Negro , and he is likely to reply that he doesn  --  t give a damn about the color of his brother-in-law 's skin as long as the knows all about logic circuitry and its relation to the design of optical magnetometers . NASA 's first run-in with Alabama 's segregationist policy came two years ago when two Negro technicians employed at the Space Flight Center applied for admission to the Huntsville branch of the University of Alabama . Marvin Phillips Carroll , an electronics engineer , and Dave Mack McGlathery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their applications were " incomplete " Just a short time before , NASA had granted the university $600,000 to help finance construction of a space research institute at the Huntsville branch . The university was then under a federal court order to admit , qualified Negroes , a re-sult of the 1956 incident involving Autherine Lucy . So when Carroll 240 and McGlathery Were rejected , the grant became not so much an aid to higher education as a partial subsidy of bigotry and law infraction . By normal standards of moral responsibility , it was time for NASA to take action ; if necessary , to threaten removal of its vast operation from the state . Instead , a- high official at the Space Flight Center called McGlathety into his office and advised him that while he was qualified and certainly entitled to take courses at the university , perhaps he would n't care to become the center of what could develop into a load and nasty controversy . Would n't it be better to wait awhile ? " I did n't want to be in a position for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space research institute , " McGlathery said after he withdrew his application . NASA had not only not put pressure on the university administration , but , according to several reports , had itself been induced to get McGlathery to withdraw his application . If the Matter had been fought out then and there , plans for the institute might have been delayed  --  a consequence intolerable to the agency 's fierce dedication and to the intellectual ? selfishness of its ghettos The following year , a federal court said that McGlathery must be allowed to enter the university , and in June he was enrolled in kmathematics course . He entered without incident , the first Negro student at the University of Alabama . He also flunked the course . " The grading was done fair and square . The course Was just too tough for me , as it was for about half the class , " McGlathery recalled as we sat in this car and talked late into a hot Alabama night . He is a slight , soft-spoken man of 27 , and a mathematician of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Negro college that admitted a white student on the very day Governor Wallace was defying ' the government by standing in the doorway at the state university , McGlathery went to work at the U S. Naval Weapons Laboratory at Dahlgren , Va . After a year there , he asked for and got a transfer to the Space Flight Center . " I soon realized I would need advance training if I was to move up in my work , " McGlathery said in explaining his reason for seeking adMission to the previously university branch in Huntsville . After Tailing the course , he waited until January of this year to enroll again , this time in a math class for which he was better prepared . ? March , when final grades were posted , McGlathery got an " A. " Dave McGlathery is not what even a militant black nationalist would call a " yessuh , boss " Negro . But neither is he apt to climb to a roof top and hurl a gasoline bomb at a White policeman Exposed on one side to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the echoing demands of Negroes everywhere , he ' seems uncertain as to his identification with the civil rights movement . There are times when he wishes he could , as he put it , " move around more " ? meaning , for instance , that he would like to go bowling when he feels like it . " None of the bowling alleys here will admit Negroes , " he said . He can play golf on the municipal course , but he ca n't swim in the municipal pool . He can eat in almost any Huntsville restaurant , but he may be , charged $45 for a single hamburger , as one Negro was . When the than complained , the manager pointed to a half-hidden sign that read : " Prices are subject to change without advance notice . " But if he never bowls again , never goes swimming in a pool that his taxes helped to build , never eats in a restaurant presided over by a host whose mind works overtime on . crafty schemes to protect segregation  --  if he never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to be a very good mathematician , and that may be What matters most to him . In that respect , he is true to the code of the new intellectual ghettos . Almost all the Negro leaders in and around HuntsVille agree that the presence of NASA has helped their community . Even before the nation became obsessed by space exploration , Madison County had more moderate race relations than most of Alabama . Huntsville Chamber of Commerce Manager Jimmy Walker , when asked why that has been so , said : " We 've got a high class of niggers here for the Most part " And Bart Slattery , Jr. , former Navy captain who now heads NASA 's information office covering Huntsville and the Michoud opera . tions plant in New Orleans , said : The NATION " We 've never really had d problem with race relations here in Huntsville . There were some lunch counter 61 ? - 111S , but nothing more serious " Like most NASA spokesmen , Slattery is quick to point out that there are laws to deal with racial inequality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That Olympian posture of detachment is constantly being reaffirmed by spokesmen for the agency throughout the . space crescent . Fortunately , however , the private industry whose future is dependent in no small measure on the continuation of the space program , is taking no chances . These companies find it prudent policy to assume that NASA is pressing for favorable changes in the Southern social structure . At the very least , they reason , the agency is n't against such changes That is what is meant by " implied pressure " A more accurate term would be " assumed pressure . " One ' significant result of NASA 's presence in Huntsville 4has been the formation of the Associadon of Huntsville Area Contractors , whose purpose is to improve the position of Negroes . The association was first proposed in July , 1963 , by Milton Cummings of Brown Engineering . Now , with a membership of twenty-eight blue-chip companies , including IBM , Boeing , Westinghouse Electric and others , the association has pledged concerted action to improve conditions of employment , education , housing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AHAC is L. . C. McMillan , a Negro who has taken a leave of absence from Prairie View A. 8 . CM . College , Prairie View , Tex. , ' where he was registrar and director of admissions . " I believe the ' concentration of government work here has speeded up ' desegregation , " McMillan said , " but all that has been achieved has come as a result of an unusually healthy climate for such actions . " AHAC recognizes the need for more Negro job applicants wha are qualified to fit into the space program at levels higher than porter or elevator operator , and is making a survey of current job opportunities and the employment practices of its members . In education , AHAC is drawing from its members ? offers to schools and ' colleges of such corporate resources as technical assistance , loans of equipment , educa7 October 19 , 1964 tional exhibits , visual aids and , personnel for professional lectures . The group has had a series of meetings with federal housing authorities in Washington , Atlanta and Birmingham in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and middle-income minority groups . This type of action has not yet been taken in the space-impact section of Cape Kennedy and Brevard County , Fla There , in the pastel-shaded town of Cocoa , Rev. W. Oliver Wells , head of the local chapter ' of the NAACP , sits in his cramped , windowless study and snaps an old bamboo fan back and forth . " Even if there are skilled Negroes available , " he says , " they will not come here ; because there is no place for them to live . I know of a Negro who is with General Electric up in the northern part of the state . He wanted to transfer here , but when he learned of housing conditions for Negroes in this area , he decided not to come . " When the tremendous space boom came to the Cocoa part of Brevard County , the need for public ' housing became acute . It was decided to build these new facilities in the Negro section of the city , and about ' two-thirds of the area was 241 taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in shacks but many had built nice homes  --  were uprooted and urged to resettle in an outlying district known as Poinsett Gardens  --  where , incidentally , they would be ineligible to vote in municipal elections . Poinsett Gardens was once known as Whispering Pines , but no matter how pleasantly " subdivisionish " the name , the area is still a snake swamp . Negroes who had owned comfortable homes in the district taken over by the Housing Authority certainly did n't care to build there , and they earned too much to be eligible for the new public housing Faced with this dilemma , some took lower-paying jobs in order to qualify ; those who were unwilling to downgrade their employment or move in with the snakes had no place to go , " This the housing situation is , holding the Negroes here back more ' than anything else , " the Reverend Wells said " There are no Negroes on the board of the Housing Authority and we ca n't even get them ' to hire a Negro in the Housing Authority office . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeping in cars because there is no other place for them . " The government , the Reverend Wells feels , has done little to correct the situation . " NASA and the people at Patrick Air Force Base have , for the most part , kept their hands off . What progress there is has come through the efforts of local people " Indeed , there is ' shockingly little government concern for social problems in the Cape Kennedy area . " We have not entered into the social aspects of integration here because we have a goal  --  to put a man on the moon  --  and that is what we are concerned with , " said a NASA spokesman at the Cape Less than a dozen Negro engineers work at the Cape . " For years , they never even had a Negro officer stationed at Patrick Air Force Base , " said ' the ' Reverend Wells . " We hollered about that and now I think there are two or ' three out there . " There are several Negro policemen in Cocoa , but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station and , have a ' white officer come out to make the arrest . Despite such handicaps , and almost in spite of NASA , Negroes living in or near any of the crescent 212 24 -- points of activity are usually further along the road to equality than are their fellows in other sections of the Deep South In New Orleans , for example , labor unions engaged in space work are integrating their rolls , many for the first time . Contractors there make a ' deliberate effort to hire Negroes in well-paying jobs , and at the ; sprawling Michoud operations plant segregated rest rooms and cafeterias have been abolished . When NASA let it be known that there would be no separate ' drinking fountains at the plant , some Southern leaders suggested that the fountains be taken out altogether and paper cups used instead . Housing remains a problem , but by far the most formidable drawback to a Negro seeking to place himself in ' the tecl-mical end of space work is the inadequacy of ' scientific instruction in Southern Negro colleges and universities . Nowhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed more openly than in the science departments of Negro and white institutions of higher learning in the South . And ' the separation and inequality become more and more pronounced as the commitment to land a man on the moon in this decade tightens its grip on the crescent . It is imperative to the success of any super-'scientific endeavor that ' there be advanced educational facilities nearby . Where such facilities were lacking in the crescent , NASA created them , through development grants at existing colleges and universities ? but always at institutions where the doctrine of separation ' of the races has prevailed . It is true , however , that the generous gifts have begun to chip away at the racial walls of these institutions . It has been done , again , through the ' device of " assumed pressure . " Recent ' developments at Rice University in Houston illustrate vividly how the process works . Wiliam Marsh Rice founded the university that bears his name in 1891 , with the intention that it be tuition-free and for whites only It was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good education without being subjected to the pomposity of Princeton or the union-label democracy of City College of New York . In short , a Rice man could read his Victor Hugo and admit that Jean Valjean had a point , but still maintain that the cotton pickers back on daddy 's Harris County spread ought to be satisfied with their 40c an hour . Proximity to a first-rate university specializing in science and engineering was a prime consideration in locating NASA 's Manned Spacecraft Center at Houston . In the few years that NASA ' and the university have worked together , there has been a steady flow of fellowship grants and other monies from Washington to the - Rice campus . At least thirty-five fellowships , worth about $5,000 each , have been awarded to Rice students . In addition , there have been outright research grants to the university . In March of this year , a district judge agreed with trustees of Rice that . the university 's flavor had gone sour in the space age He ruled favorably on their request to set aside William Rice 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the admission of Negroes As part of their argument , the trustees said continuation of the university 's segregated status would jeopardize the valuable NASA research contracts . It is not expected that Rice will take in many Negroes . In the first place , entrance requirements are so high that Negroes , handicapped by preparation at all-Negro public schools , will find it very difficult to qualify . Secondly , the new tuition rate has been set at $1,200 a year . The university will continue to admit as many tuition-free students as available endowment income permits , but Negroes are not likely to be among them . Unless he is brilThe NATION liant , wealthy , and probably a ' graduate ' student , a Negro need not apply now at newly desegregated Rice University . NASA money is similarly flowing to universities in other parts of the crescent . It results , of course , in a major emphasis on science and mathematics , and , as they say in the parlance of the ghetto , a " phasing out " of emphasis on the liberal arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondary and primary schools as well . In Huntsville , where school enrollment increased from 5,423 in 1956 to more than 23,000 in 1963 , it is jokingly claiined that youngsters learn to count down before up ' . New school construction in Huntsville amounts to one additional classroom every Week of the year  --  classrooms that Serve as settings for some of the most competent scientific instruction offered in public schools anywhere in the country . Public schools in ' Florida 's Breyard County also reflect this profound effect of the space program . The growth of the schools there is from an enrollment of 4,700 in 1952 to ' the present figure of 41,000 ; it is still rising . It is ' estimated that 2,000 of the students have parents who live and work on federal properties , and for each the public school system receives a $190 yearly " impaCt payment " from the ' govern-merit . Another 16,500 of the 41,000 - students have parents who work for the government in some capacity Public-School enrollment has risen sharply in Houston and New Orleans , too , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the impact of the space program on , secondary and primary education is not as clearly outlined . Brevard County Superintendent of Schools Woodrow J. Darden denies that science and math get a larger boost than do the liberal arts . He did say , though , that the presence of NASA at Cape Kennedy has an effect on what is - taught , in that " there is more interest in science and math because of the area in which the students live " He added proudly that the ' science courses offered in the Brevard system compare favorably with those ' offered in many small colleges . No one was much surprised , therefore , when Jim Hess , a ninth grader at the county 's Satellite High School , was honored by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronauts for ' his work in symbolic logic . The old-time residents of the crescent  --  those who were there long before Wernher von Braun started tinkering with , the V-2 at Peenerminde  --  are not ready to admit that the social structure is undergoing major changes . The Breyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Methodist Church , and the Cocoa Junior ' Women 's Club commands the Sunday society page spreads in the local papers The old life continues , and its still a land where a man mixes his gin with grapefruit juice , and nice ladies pat their foreheads with dabs of perfumed linen and remark , " My goodness gracious , but it 's warm today " But those are surface appearances , and even on the surface the scene is changing . For every native-born soloist in the church musical , there can be found along Cocoa Beach 's gaudy motel row two belly dancers from Chicago ; for each fatback-flavored reflection of Old Huntsville First Family pride , there are a dozen new voices calling for sensible liquor laws ( how the bootlegger of the Deep South fits into the space age has yet to be made clear ) , The impact of NASA on the re'gion goes below the surface , down to - where the social soul of the land lies .
