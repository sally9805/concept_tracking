At 64 , California 's former ( 1953-59 ) Republican Governor Goodwin Jess Knight has most of the things that make men content : a handsome wife , a pleasant home in Los Angeles , robust good health , and a comfortable income that includes an annual $16,000 state pension and an $850-a-week job as a television commentator . But Goodie Knight is restless : he wants to be Governor again . <P> Last week , after announcing at a news conference that he plans to run for Governor next year , Goodie took to the road in his air-conditioned Cadillac , drove some 50 miles from Los Angeles to the sleepy town of San Clemente . Pulling up to the town 's community center , where a Republican women 's federation waited to hear him , Goodie turned for a moment to his wife Virginia , who had accompanied him . " Honey . " he asked , " why do n't I just take the salary and the pension and forget about all this ? " Without pausing , he continued : " I 'll tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet again . I ca n't keep out of it . I love this state and I loved being Governor , and I 'm going to make another push for it . " Said Virginia Knight , with an understanding smile : " What 's that song ? It 's better the second time around ? " <P> At least one prominent California Republican would violently disagree with Virginia : to Richard Nixon , Goodie 's gubernatorial candidacy could only come as a Knightmare . Under relentless pressure to run for Governor against Democratic Incumbent " Pat " Brown as a way to keep alive his 1964 presidential chances , Nixon had hoped to run uncontested in the Republican primary . Knight 's announcement shattered that hope-and although he often acts like a clown , Goodie is a formidable California campaigner . As he himself mused last week : " I speak Spanish , and of course we have a large Spanish population . I have a real feeling for the Jewish people . I have always championed Negroes . I 've heard from a lot of these people , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional men , teachers , women and men in every walk of life . They say they want me to run for Governor . " <P> Dick Nixon , still withholding any formal announcement of his own plans , reacted blandly to Knight 's candidacy : " I think Mr. Knight had a perfect right to announce his candidacy . " But for Nixon , the prospects were nonetheless distressing : even if he were to beat Goodie Knight in the Republican gubernatorial primary , the bitter G.O.P. split might well ensure Governor Brown 's reelection . And Goodie seemed to be itching to cause just such a split . " If Dick gets into it , " he said last week , " we 're going to have a terrible fight , a really terrible fight . I 'm in , and I 'm not getting out . "
