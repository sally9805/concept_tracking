The late members of the audience are being seated in the auditorium . Off-stage behind the main curtain of the center stage the overture hymn-singing begins  --  a great phlegm-hoarse male voice leading off solo in an old favorite folk-hymn . Each syllable is sung staccato and heavily punctuated . VOICE On Jord-an 's stor-my banks I stand &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And cast a wist-ful eyeTo Ca-naan 's fair and hap-py land &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where my pos-ses-sions lie . ( A surge of male voices now joins in , all singing the chorus in unison . ) VOICES I am bound for the promised land , I am bound for the promised land , O who will come and go with me ? I am bound for the promised land . ( A flock of women 's voices comes in , young and old , a full congregation singing in four-part harmony now and still in the heavily punctuated rhythm . ) CONGREGATION All o'er those wide extended plains &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shines one eternal day.There God the Son forever reigns &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And scatters night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. p. 3 ( The beat of marching feet begins in the distance behind the curtain in time with the singing , gradually drawing nearer . ) No chilling winds nor poisonous breath &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Can reach that healthful shore , Sickness and sorrow , pain and death &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Are felt and feared no more . ( The sound of marching feet grows stronger , spilling into the auditorium right and left and front and rear from amplifiers planted there . ) I am bound for the promised land  --  etc . ( At the moment the marching feet seem about to break through the front curtain , the singing ends abruptly on a high chord and the marching with it . Four loud bass drum strokes in the same rhythm follow on the ended chord , and then the unseen drummer continues a zooming suspenseful vibrato on the drumhead . A little off-scene reed organ strikes up in the next hymn and along with a soft drum-tap accompanies the congregation which bursts forth in a powerful four-part harmony . ) We sing the mighty pow'r of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spreads the flowing seas abroad , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And builds the lofty skies . We sing the wisdom that ordains &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The sun to rule the day , The moon to shine at his commands &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And all the stars obey ! A WOMAN 'S VOICE ( High and pleading . ) Have mercy upon us , blessed Jesus ! p. 4 OTHER VOICES Yes , yes , Jesus , yes ! ( Once more the drumstick makes its suspenseful vibrato , and the organ swiftly modulates into the next hymn . The congregation now sings with some sprightliness , however dark the words . ) CONGREGATION Thee we adore , eternal Name ! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And humbly own to theeHow feeble is our mortal frame &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What dying worms we be ! A MAN 'S VOICE ( Shaken and piteous . ) Worms , worms ! ANOTHER MAN 'S VOICE Pity us , merciful Savior ! CONGREGATION The year rolls round and steals away &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The breath that first it gave , Whate'er we do , where'er we be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( The singing and the music abruptly stop . After an instant of silence a chorus of girls ' voices burst into harmony unaccompanied . ) GIRLS ' VOICES There is a land of pure delight &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Where saints immortal reign , Eternal day excludes the night , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And pleasures banish pain . There everlasting spring abides &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And never with'ring flow'rs , Death like a narrow sea divides &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This heavenly land from ours . VOICES ( Men 's and women 's ad lib . ) Beautiful heaven ! The shining streets of the New Jerusalem  --  let my eyes behold them . p. 5 WOMEN 'S VOICES We 'll drink from the waters of life there ! MEN 'S VOICES And play on our harps with a thousand strings ! ( a male quartet now comes in and like the girls ' hymn unaccompanied and with the proper barbershop minors and shadings . ) QUARTET Come , O my soul , in sacred laysAttempt thy great Creator 's praise ; But , O what tongue can speak his fame ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radiant spheres , He glory like a garment wearsTo form a robe of light divine , Ten thousand suns around him shine . CONGREGATION Blessed be the name of God ! QUARTET In all our Maker 's grand designsOmnipotence with wisdom shines , His works through all this wondrous frameDeclare the glory of his name ! VOICES Glory ! Glory ! ( The singing ends on a long drawn-out harmony , with the first tenor wavering in and out a bit for soul-effect . The organ and drum sound a return to the opening hymn . The auditorium becomes dark . The marching feet strike the floor once more with the same explosive violence with which they had ended , the sound coming in from different directions as before. ) p. 6 CONGREGATION When shall I reach that happy place &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And be forever blest ?  --  ( The marching feet begin to recede , the drum and organ receding with them . ) When shall I see my Father 's face &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And in his bosom rest ? I am bound for the promised land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pianissimo now and remain so . The marching feet continue to be heard in the distance and so does the singing , serving as an accompaniment to the illuminated Biblical text which unrolls itself on a screen lowered in front of the center stage curtain . A richly evangelical and stern voice reads the text as it appears , increasing in fervor and feeling somewhat as the words proceed . ) VOICE AND TEXT Your iniquities have separated between you and your God , And your sins have hid his face from you.Your tongues mutter perversity , And your hands are defiled with blood.Who among you calleth for justice ? Who pleadeth for the truth ? You trust in vanity and conceive mischief , You bring forth cockatrice 's eggsAnd weave the spider 's web . ( Sonorously . ) And he that eateth of these eggs dieth , And that which is crushedBreaketh out into a viper.Your feet run to evil , And you make haste to shed innocent blood . ( Almost fiercely ) p. 7 Your thoughts are of wasting and destructionAnd the ways of peace ye know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , O Jerusalem , to thy tabernacle ! For vengeance is mine saith the Lord ! ( As the voice and text end , the organ and drum give a loud final chord and beat , and the distant congregation sounds forth conclusively and loudly . ) NOTE . During the above overture material it may be well to have different neighborhood people pass along the road as if on their way to church . CONGREGATION A  --  me  --  e  --  e  --  n ! ( The screen goes up out of sight in the darkness . After an instant of silence , the sound of a gay banjo plunking and singing are heard off at the left front . The light comes up there. ) @x A roadway runs along in front of the center stage and at a lower level , disappearing to the right and left . It is an afternoon in late summer . The singers approaching on this road are rough and untrained but they make a merry and pleasing harmony in happy contrast to the dour hymns and the judgment-day condemnation of the text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Entering at the left now comes a raggle-taggle happy-go-lucky long-haired crew of hill people , four men and one woman . The men all carry tow sacks over their shoulders in which a discreet number of jars and jugs of salable liquor are concealed . This is the Skerritt family of moonshiners , consisting of old Jacob , his wife Rachel and their three sons  --  Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego , these last names being abbreviated to Shad , Meesh and Bedney . They are singing a ballad of their own liking as they enter , and Rachel is expertly raking her banjo with her long , gnarl-nailed calloused fingers in accompaniment . SKERRITTS John Hardy was a mean and desperated man , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He toted two guns every day , He shot hisself a man down in New Orleans town  --  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; John Hardy 's got to hang , they say  --  poor boy ( spoken ) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; John Hardy 's got to hang today . ( As they come stepping along the road , we get a good view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gnarled character almost as exaggerated in his makeup as the puppet character of Punch himself  --  with gray-bearded jowls , a long mustache , ragged hair , a huge nose and somewhat humped-over shoulders . He walks with a waddling motion , moving his torso from left to right as he makes his way on , leaning on a heavy brutal cudgel . He is a tough character and by no means weak and eldish , an exaggerated figure of folk life , a sort of Silenus or local Dionysus even . His wife Rachel is a Judy character , made up like a puppet woman and joyously chewing tobacco as she comes , and now and then spitting off to one side . Her hair is stringy and unkempt and her dress bedraggled and down to her ankles . The three sons are also creatures of the earth and woods , untidy and free-wheeling . Shad , the youngest , is about 23 years old and his face is gleeful and joyous , his hair kinky and knotted like cinquapin burrs and thick about his ears and neck . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineer 's cap , and holds a reed flute in his free hand . His second brother Meesh is about 25 and is a dummy and carries a long-barreled shotgun . His clothes are earth-colored like Shad 's and his hair longer but not kinky , and topped with an old ragged gray felt hat . The third devoted brother Bedney is dressed like the other two and is even more haired and mustached and is bare-headed . He also carries a long-barreled shotgun . All of these including old Rachel are barefooted . As they jiggle along , they cavort a bit now and then in their rambunctious outdoor spirit , their steps taking on a sort of choreographed pattern , especially Shad 's as he skirls out a splash of notes with his flute which he uses as a sort of conductor 's baton for the group . ) John Hardy told the sher'ff he was a natural man , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The quickest shot ever was known , The sher'ff pulled his gun , John Hardy blowed him down , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And the sher'ff give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the sher'ff give a cry and was gone . ( Shad points to a clump of bushes at the left rear ) p. 9 SHAD Cool drink of water  --  I 'm burning down ! ( They all turn in toward the spring , and with their heads close together pour out a stanza of concluding close harmony . ) SKERRITTS John Hardy had a wife , her name was Polly Ann , She wore a dress made of the blue , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; She said , " My darling John , all the long time you were gone &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I waited here alone for you "  --  poor Poll  --  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your little loving wife stayed true . ( They end on a close tight chord , and Rachel floods in a few more concluding gushes from her banjo . ) SHAD ( With a crowing shout . ) Good old John Hardy ! BEDNEY Yeh , stuck right in there to the end . RACHEL And down with the law ! ( They lay down their bags . Shad reaches into the spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rachel lays aside her banjo , spits out her wad of chewing tobacco and takes a drink . Shad holds the gourd toward his father . Jacob shudders . ) JACOB Nanh  --  anh ! ( He pulls a bottle from his pocket and takes a drink of liquor , then holds the bottle out toward Rachel . ) Would my old sow like to wet her gullet ? p. 10 RACHEL Yes , you old boar hog , give your baby a suck . ( She takes the bottle and drinks copiously and hands it back . As she does so , she favors Jacob with a big wet kiss . He shakes his head joyously . ) JACOB Married thirty-three years and still hot as two minks in March , both of us . SHAD ( Cutting a goatish step . ) Yeh , the power ! We all got the power . JACOB Nothing like good liquor to keep your manhood strong . ( Now mournfully . ) Poor Joseph , my son ! RACHEL And your womanhood . ( Meesh and Bedney take the dipper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or seat themselves in the cool shade to rest a moment . ) JACOB Yeh , son Joseph 's ruint  --  lost his manhood and turnt preacher . ( With a groan . ) I ca n't get over it . Every time I take a drink I think on it . RACHEL Maybe he 'll reform yet and go back to sinning again . Every night I ask the devil to help us . BEDNEY And he could make the best corn liquor of any of us . JACOB True , true . ( Simulating looking in a little hand mirror . ) Lord God , my nose is as red as a fire coal in hell ! ( Admiring it . ) Looks mighty purty . ( He fingers it lovingly. ) p. 11 RACHEL Yeh , every night in bed I can see it shining in the dark beside me like a headlight , and I know you ai n't dead . ( She tears off a mouthful of tobacco from a plug she has drawn from her apron pocket and sits chewing contentedly away . Meesh goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his shotgun . For a moment no one speaks . Shad puts his reed flute to his lips and begins a mournful melody . ) JACOB There you are playing that sad song again . Quit it ! RACHEL Yeh , play something happy like " Liquor and Love . " ( Shad plays a bit more of the melody . ) SHAD A mighty purty song . ( Staring off . ) Nigh purty as the one that sings it . JACOB Huh ? BEDNEY Must be that wild girl he 's talking about  --  I bet he heard her singing it  --  ( Snickering. )  --  while he was hiding round watching her traipsing in the woods or swimming in the creok . SHAD ( Jumping to his feet and stamping the ground . ) God knows she 's the purtiest thing that ever dabbled in the dew . Makes my mouth water to think of her . Hot dog !

SHAD A sweet thing to be laid in the grass , buzzard or no buzzard . JACOB ( Sternly , loudly . ) Shad Skerritt ! We got run out of Granville for what you done to that nigger gal in the cotton patch , and we want to live here in Harnett County in peace , make our liquor and live all law-abiding . Of course if there 's a lot of fun in it , that 's something else . ( Gesturing toward one of the tow bags . ) That reminds me  --  be sure to leave a gallon of the aged stuff at Sheriff Whinny Claws ' house . He 's on our side , and we 've promised to vote for him . RACHEL And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns our wine jugs . Seems like they use enough communion wine at that Church of God in Jesus Name to keep all the deacons stone drunk night and day . ( Meesh up at the rear begins pointing off to the right with his gun and making his whickering blubbering noises. ) p. 13 SHAD My , my , look who 's coming ! ( The others stand up and look off . The older Skerritt brother , Joseph , enters in a hurry on the road at the right . He is a Jesus-like figure , some thirty years old , and bears a close resemblance to the Sunday School card pictures of the suffering and mild Savior . He wears a long brown gown that comes down nearly to his ankles , showing his bare feet as he walks . His hair is thick and womanish and hangs down over his shoulders . His face is mild and gentle , and a sprinkle of brown beard covers his chin . He carries a long slender homemade shepherd 's crook . As he enters , Shad pulls off his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) SHAD Good evening , Brother Joseph . How goes it with Jesus Christ today ? ( Joseph hurries up to his father . ) JOSEPH Father  --  Mother  --  please be quiet . I have a funeral coming . I heard your loud banjo and singing here . Please . JACOB Who 's dead , Joseph ? JOSEPH The little Rose boy , Benjamin . Our heavenly Father has called him home . He was just four years old . ( He glances humbly upward . Jacob snorts . Meesh slips up behind Joseph and lifts his skirt , then blubbers and whickers his fun . Shad and Bedney turn about guffawing. ) p. 14 JACOB You ca n't blame your brothers for laughing at you , Joseph , and you wearing a woman 's dress like that . JOSEPH ( Patiently . ) I know you do n't understand , Father , Mother , but I try in my weak way to follow Jesus . And night and day I pray for you . JACOB But now you do n't have fun , Joseph  --  you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . ( Pleadingly . ) Repent and come back to the true path , Joseph , repent and come back to the goodly way of life . JOSEPH Hush , Father , I will still pray for you all .

JOSEPH ( With a gentle smile . ) If you only knew the peace that passeth understanding  --  in here . ( He touches his breast . ) Yes , like you I was lost in sin , making liquor , my eyes like Shad 's there straying after women  --  but by the whiskey still , in the deep of the night  --  under that great pine tree  --  God spoke to me . I heard his voice . ( Conclusively . ) And so with Brother Zahab I follow in the steps of Jesus , saving the sinful , healing the sick  --  ( Gesturing to the right. )  --  and burying the dead . Now please be respectful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially to the broken-hearted sister . ( He turns and goes back the way he came . The Skerritts pick up their bags and move a bit toward the spring and stand looking off at the right. ) p. 15 SHAD It 's her brother  --  that wild girl 's little brother . You heard Joseph say so . ( Joyously . ) Now I 'll see her come by . ( Off-scene on the road at the right the low bum-bum of a big bass drum is heard sounding in mournful slow-march rhythm . The head of the funeral cortege enters from the right , Joseph leading the way now with his shepherd 's staff . Behind him comes the little coffin , with a large exaggerated spray of colorful wild flowers draped over it , carried on a litter by two young farmers , Pallie Joth and Epsy Tutts . On one side walks Firthy Goadges , the leader of the singing in the church , and on the other Punky Spiel , a neighboring farmer , these four making a singing quartet on occasions . The sides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little Benjy with a big red rose in his white hand can be seen stretched out in it.Immediately behind the coffin come the three members of the Rose family  --  Father Zekiel , Mother Ishma and their daughter Christine . Zekiel is a meek toil-worn man of fifty-five or sixty , with long plow-handle arms and work-toughened hands and shoulders stooped from hard outdoor labor . He wears a dark sober suit and a black felt hat , neat and weather-beaten from long service . Ishma is about forty-five , gray-haired and slender and dressed in dark mourning , with a black veil over her dark straw hat and with black cotton gloves . The daughter Christiane is a beautiful full-figured young girl of eighteen or nineteen with large haunting dark eyes , mournful and hurt-filled , and midnight black hair pulled straight back and hooded under a dark shawl . She too is in mourning . Her head is bowed and she walks almost as if in a dream , her steps slow , jerky and unwilling . Giles Sampson , a young farmer of some twenty-eight or thirty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , assists her along . He is dressed in good stout farm clothes suitable both to his character and to the occasion . A number of neighbors come behind these , including the old holy woman Aunt Minky Icks , a little bent wizened creature with darting coal-black eyes . Coy Schofield comes along last in the line with his bass drum making its legato muffled beat . The quartet begins singing , sweetly , piteously. ) p. 16 QUARTET In the land of fadeless day &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lies the city four-square , And it ne'er shall pass away &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For there is no night there . ( Christine beings struggling with Giles as the singing stirs her feelings to overflowing . ) CHRISTINE No , no ! Do n't make me go ! GILES ( Trying to soothe her . ) Please , honey , please  --  it 'll be all right . ( Joseph turns back . The procession stops . He puts his hand gently and yearningly on Christine 's head . Zekiel shakes his head in sorrow and embarrassment . Ishma stuffs her handkerchief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christine . Little Benjy is at rest now . His sufferings are over . ( He smiles wanly and sweetly at Christine.She begins to sing and half-recite queerly into the air . He sadly drops his hand from her head . CHRISTINE Or ever the silver cord be loosedOr the golden bowl be broken , Or the pitcher be broken at the fountain , Or the wheel broken at the cistern . ISHMA ( Clinging to Father Zekiel . ) Oh , I wish she would n't ! p. 17 CHRISTINE ( In a hollow voice . ) Over  --  sufferings over ! Hah ! ( Resuming her queer son-recitative . ) Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was , And the spirit shall return unto  --  return unto  --  ( Loudly . ) The worm that dieth not , The worm ! ( With a little shriek . ) Vanity of vanities saith the preacher , All is vanity ! ( The godless Skerritts have taken off their hats and caps and now stand with slightly bowed heads in the presence of death . Shad with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Giles sees him and steps in front of him . ) GILES ( Quietly but sternly . ) We do n't need you here , Shad Skerritt . ( He takes Christine 's arm again . She tries to pull loose . ) SHAD Why do n't you let her alone ! ( He reaches toward Christine but Giles grabs his arm with a powerful grip and turns him aside . Christine slowly raises her head and looks around at Shad . ) CHRISTINE It 's you . ( Shad smiles at her . ) SHAD And it 's you . CHRISTINE I know who you are . You run wild in the woods . I 've seen you there playing your flute . p. 18 SHAD And I 've seen you . CHRISTINE In a book long ago I read about you . Your name is Pan . SHAD I 'm Shad . CHRISTINE Pan .

( Jacob and Bedney run up and pull Shad back . Giles turns as if to go after Christine , then shakes his head and stands by Ishma . ) ZEKIEL Let her be , let her be . JOSEPH She must weep her grief alone . ( He gestures with his staff , and the procession moves on as before , the singing and the drum beats resuming . ) QUARTET God shall wipe away all tears , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There 's no death , no pain nor fears , And they count not time by years &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For there is no night there . ( The mourners move on down the road to the left . ) There they need no sunshine bright &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In the city four-square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; And there is no night there  --  God shall wipe  --  ( The procession now disappears in the distance , the song dying away . The Skerritts pick up their bags and start on along the road to the right . Suddenly Giles runs in again from the left , and stepping in front of Shad , full of fury , shouts in his face. ) p. 19 GILES If ever you touch her , I 'll break every bone in your body !

( The song of the roisterers dies away , and the light fades from the road . After a moment the sound of Christine 's voice la-la-ing her sad folk melody is heard in the distance behind the center stage . In the darkness the curtains part , and as the melody continues , the center stage is suffused with light. ) @x The scene is the edge of a field , with a little hillock ascending at the rear . Diagonally across the forepart a hedgerow of sassafras , sumac , dogwood and persimmon bushes is growing . The sumac is already turning a deep red and the sassafras a rich lemon color in the summer 's ending . Interspersed among the hedge bushes as well as in front of them is a colorful display of late flowers  --  goldenrod , queen Anne 's lace , blue asters , morning glory , trumpet vine and butterfly weed . The flowers are stylized and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male cardinal ( red bird ) sitting in the hedge over at the left . He is of fiery vermilion color and about the size of a crow , and with a plumy top-knot . Up and behind the hillock the sky stretches away in a copperish misty glow , shutting down over the world like a bowl and illumined in a sickly light by the unseen slanting afternoon sun . A path screened by the hedgerow crosses the crest of the hill . The la-la-ing draws nearer , and Christine enters at the right rear . Her cheeks are somewhat apple-tinted by now by the sun and wind , and her thick overflow of hair is loosened and cascades down her back . She is barefooted and carries her shawl in one hand and now and then flips or twirls it nervously in the air . In the other hand she holds a flabby and dead daisy stalk , the head of which is about the size of a small sunflower . She stands looking out at the wide over-reaching copper sky at the back , her troubled eyes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passes into half-sung , half-recited words .

( Pritty Bird nods happily and chirps again . She comes down the incline now and through the hedge . As she does so , the flowers take on an added brightness , and Pritty Bird grows more vermillion-colored , as if their spirits were joyed at her coming , whatever her own melancholy may be . ) CHRISTINE Good evening , sweet flowers  --  Goldenrod , Queen Anne 's Lace , and Asters  --  all of you .

The elfin sound of a flute is presently heard , and with something of an echo-chamber effect far away at the rear beyond the little hillock . A ghostly halo spotlight now fades in , revealing Christine lying there in her little clearing among the hillside bushes . The flowers are in shadow . As the flute continues its queer rendering of the willow song melody , a mystic green light fills the air above and behind the hillock , and there as if standing on air the figures of Christine 's dreaming swim into visualization . The first to appear is young Shad Skerritt . He is bareheaded and his face is now beautiful , Adonis-like but gleeful and prankish . This dream-Shad is playing the melody in such a manner as to suggest his casting a spell over the sleeping Christine . He lifts his flute from his lips , throws back his head in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand on the flute and gesturing energetically with the other for her to follow him yonder , way , way yonder to the hills . As if obeying his will , Christine rises and starts moving automaton-like up the incline , her eyes closed , her hands extended in front of her , palms outward , as if feeling her way toward him . The distorted but strong burst of an organ chord breaks in , and then the mellifluous and aerial singing of girls ' voices follows as if determined to absorb the flute melody , which it does. ) p. 29 GIRLS ' VOICES ( Clear-syllabled , definite and positive . ) The Lord my shepherd is , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I shall be well supplied , Since he is mine and I am his , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What can I want beside ? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  --  What can I want beside ?

As the singing continues he lifts his crook and waves it in the air , and Shad and his flute slowly disappear . Then Joseph moves toward Christine . She sinks softly down to the ground as if returning to her rest .

( Joseph now kneels beside Christine , stretches his hand out in blessing and bends his face yearningly toward hers . A flash of lightning breaks in the sky above and at the rear of the scene , accompanied almost instantly by another roar and rumbling of thunder . He rises and turns quickly toward the rear . The thunder continues to mutter angrily under the earth . A burst of powerful and weird congregational singing surges in , accompanied by the beat of the bass drum . The huge figure of the great H oliness preacher and faith-healer , Reverend Esau Zahab , appears in the air at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his mask is devilish , with fierce red eyebrows tilted upward and a heavy sensual mouth showing through a bramble of red wiry beard . This voluminous red beard hangs down almost to the ground . He is dressed in funereal black . In one hand he carries a Bible about two feet by three feet in size and glowing like a glowworm . The other hand with extended forefinger points admonishingly toward heaven . He reaches out and sweeps Reverend Joseph away with a violent gesture and moves toward Christine , holding his Bible aloft as if to bring it down crushingly on her like a great stone . The thunder fades out and distant congregational singing comes in queerly and loudly. ) p. 30 CONGREGATION Day of judgment , day of wonders , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hark the trumpet 's awful sound , Louder than a thousand thunders &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shakes the vast creation round . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How the summons &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Will the sinner 's heart confound !

( He comes running in at the right rear along the hillock top . He is dressed as before and carries a rake in his hand . At his entrance the nightmare figure of Reverend Zahab vanishes , and the scene returns to the normal light of the late afternoon sun but still with no returning radiance on the now forgotten flowers. ) p. 31 GILES ( Throwing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gives her a little shake , the shouts off . ) I have found her !

Zahab , as seen in Christine 's dream , is a huge , hairy-faced man but with his beard much shorter . His assistants are small squattish fellows , middle-aged and with sickly ignorant faces marked by long nights of prayer , periods of gluttony , fasting and flagellations . These two are dressed exactly alike in worn dark clothes , slick celluloid tie-less collars and black little derby hats . Rev. Zahab is dressed in similar dark clothes but wears no hat , his wild thick uncombed hair shaking in the wind . The three men are squeezed tight together on the one narrow buggy seat with Rev. Zahab , who is driving , seated in the middle . He is so large that the other two have to lean out from him in order to stay on the seat . They are all barefooted . Zahab holds the reins in one hand and a long buggy whip , with a vicious plaited rawhide lash , in the other . Brother Joseph , dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Jubilee is sitting just to the left and in front of the little room on a horse-block , his head drooped over . This is where he roosts and stays on guard over Christine .

She said seven black cats sat around the house the night she was born as a baby , and their eyes were like fire coals and they spat little blue flames from their tongues every time they meowed .

That 's a year ago  --  and the shadbush was snowwhite in the woods and the dogwood was coming on and the maple buds were swelling , some of them red as fire .  --  The sassafras sprouts were green and a soft sweet wind was blowing in my hair . You remember , Giles ? GILES I do n't remember . CHRISTINE Oh yes , you do . It was the Easter picnic . We went to Raven Rock with the boys and girls , and Firthy Goadges sang and we all sang  --  " In the gloaming , oh my darling . " ( Giles throws up his hands and stands looking at the floor . She hurries on . ) And after we 'd eaten all that fried chicken and the pies  --  Aunt Betsy 's wonderful apple pie  --  you and I went walking down chat path that led to the spring and beyond . There under the big beech tree where the violets were blooming so blue and pure we stood and you carved our initials on that tree  --  ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. R.  --  G. S. "  --  and then you put your knife away and took me in your arms . You remember , Giles ? p. 55 GILES ( In a half-smothered voice . ) I 'm not a cold corpse . CHRISTINE And my arms were tight about you and my breasts were all on fire and I pushed you back and we fell on the ground and I held to you and I said , " Take me , Giles , take me . I am yours . " GILES ( Roughly . ) And I held you so tight you could n't breathe . ( Shouting . ) And you ask me do I remember ! CHRISTINE ( In a sort of wild singing . ) And my heart was reaching like mad .

And then , your face against mine , that look came in your eyes , that terrible look and you flung me away from you and you hurt my leg , too , against a big rock . ( She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drops it . ) But I did n't let you know my leg was hurt . The hurt was in my heart  --  that look that said I was evil . And so , Giles , you hit me in the face and I 've not forgot it . And you stood up and said , " Let 's go , let 's go . " GILES ( Half-ragingly . ) Yes , yes , I said let 's go . For I was trembling all over . There you stood in front of me , your face all rosy pink and your lips so full and rich and red like ripe plums  --  ( Wagging his head . ) And I knew if I did n't get away from there I would hurt you . ( Striking the table with his fist . ) And I did n't want to hurt you . It was because I loved you so . Another man who did n't love you with the right kind of love  --  did n't respect you  --  would have abused you and then he would have left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms . ) You see , darling , it was because I love you that I said let 's go . p. 56 CHRISTINE And I wanted to show you how much I loved you that day , so I said , " Take me , Giles , take me . " GILES God Almighty , you must see it my way ! We were both raised to believe that that would be a sin  --  a sin if we had each other before we were married . CHRISTINE I know , I know . And you believe the love I felt was wrong . ( She snaps her fingers dismissingly . ) So the wedding is delayed , Giles . ( Singing mischievously . ) Rosy apple , lemon or pearBunch of lilies I wo n't wear , Gold and silver by my side  --  Ask another girl to be your bride . How about Ota Pippin ? She loves you . I see her brown eyes oozing sweet sugar every time she looks at you . GILES ( Loudly . ) I said I love you ! And you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you yourself  --  your sweet body too . ( Sucking in his breath . ) God knows how sweet ! No woman on earth as sweet . I lie awake at night in my bed and think of having you there in my arms , and it seems like I ca n't stand it . I ca n't wait for you  --  ca n't wait any more . And I get up and walk outside in the cool air , and I look up at the stars and they ai n't stars at all . They 're your bright eyes sparkling at me , calling to me , calling  --  ( He strikes the table with his fist again. ) p. 57 CHRISTINE ( Staring at him . ) Then why do n't you come to me when you ca n't sleep ? Break in the door there into my room ? Or whistle outside my window and let me come to you . Ha-ha . He thinks it would be wrong . But it would be right . And it 's wrong for him to say it 's not right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) GILES Well , why in the name of God do you keep saying no to our wedding ! Keep putting it off ! ( He takes a step toward her and lays his hand on her shoulder again . She shrinks away . ) And you 're not crazy , you 're not , the way some people say . You just pretend all this wild talk  --  wandering in the fields and woods and hearing music playing . CHRISTINE ( Turning back . ) I never pretend , Giles , and you know it . What comes out of my lips comes out of my heart . ( With a small cold chuckle . ) Tell-tale tit , Your tongue shall be slit , And every little dogShall have a bite of it . GILES ( Almost with a shout . ) There you go again . ( Angrily now . ) And if that Shadrach Skerritt had had you down by Raven Rock , you 'd have been ruined and the shame of the neighborhood ! CHRISTINE I 'm already the shame . Did n't old Minky Icks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Babylon and the neighborhood was cursed because of me . Why should n't I talk foolish when I want to , with all these God-crazy people around me ! ( In the distance the preachers are heard arriving .

Now you have help  --  the great preacher himself coming to bring you to the house of God . CHRISTINE ( Looking about the room in terror . ) Help me , Giles , help me . GILES He 'll not hurt you . He 's got great power to help you . CHRISTINE I wo n't face him , I wo n't  --  I 'm afraid . ( She turns and starts to fly from the room . Giles reaches out and seizes her by the wrist . ) GILES ( Sternly , commandingly . ) Oh no you do n't !

Rachel is in front plucking away on her banjo and leading the song , and she is something of a spectacle now with an outlandish big beribboned yellow hat and , hanging about her neck , a long white feather boa which she has set herself up to in town . Jacob too has indulged his taste by adorning himself with a wide-brimmed Panama hat and a politician 's type of long-square coat which comes nearly down to his knees . Meesh and Bedney are dressed as before . Their tow sacks are empty now , for they have disposed of their liquor . SKERRITTS ( In rough harmony . ) My Father was a gambler . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He taught me how to playWith high card or low card , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He 'd bet them night and day , Saying , " Son , do n't go a-begging . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Whilst you got the ace and tray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Then hang me , oh , hang me , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I 'll be dead and gone.Then hang me , oh , hang me , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And I 'll be dead and gone  --  I would n't mind the hanging &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But it 's lying in the grave so long .

And it 's right for my hair and my school girl 's complexion . ( She kisses the hanging ribbons . Suddenly she lets out a little cry . ) Oh , Lord-a-mercy ! JACOB What in the name of God now ! RACHEL I just thought  --  maybe Shad has been arrested .

" JACOB Aw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm worried . JACOB Of all the fool doings . You got to realize Shad is a grown man and do n't wear his dirty hippens no more , though God A'mighty knows his britches are dirty enough . He 's a man now , twenty-three years old and has got I reckon a dozen woods colts up there in Granville . RACHEL Think of it  --  twelve little bastards and I bet they 're all purty like my Shad .

The congregation is assembled there for the ritual of casting the Evil One out of sinful Christine Rose . In the middle foreground of the stage is a low pulpit behind which sits Reverend Zahab with Reverend Hickoop on his right and Reverend Mudgett on his left . Joseph with his shepherd 's staff is standing to the left of Mudgett . Up behind the preachers as if on ascending bleachers the main body of the choir is gathered , consisting of young People  --  Pallie Joth , Ficey Poplin , Epsy Tutts , Punky Spiel , Siffy Sowars , Nymphy Goggong , Dizzie Dosher , Clossy Gush , Gonora Belch and Ota Pippin . To the right of the pulpit on a lower level is what in common parlance is known as the " old women 's corner . " Here a little group of the older local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and black sunbonnets  --  is gathered  --  old Minky Icks , Wixie Crisp , Daphne Dudd , and Letha Mogue . Little Ludie Dudd is standing close to her mother . Letha is holding the hand of her idiot boy Sippiehaw , a 19-year-old over-large youth in a knee-trousered child 's suit . Over to the left a contrasting group , older men , is assembled in dark clothes suitable for the mournful occasion  --  Hiteous Belch , Belove Boushee , Dodo Dudd and Didymus Trout . Little Doremus Dudd is close to his father . Just to the left front of this group of men is a reed organ . Euphrosine Spiel is playing it , her baby-doll face lifted in the song . Standing by the organ and conducting the singing is mustached Firthy Goadges with his humn book , his long arm sweeping back and forth in the air . To the right of the organ is Coy Schofield , now beginning to make his soft vibrato on the drumhead . Everybody joins in the hymn  --  the young and the old , men and women alike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependeth Lo ! the book exactly worded , Wherein all hath been recorded ; Thence shall judgment be awarded.When the Judge His seat attaineth , And each hidden deed arraigneth , Nothing unavenged remaineth .

They are dressed in white robes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with holes for eyes and mouthpieces cut into them  --  frightful creatures resembling the dreaded Ku Klux Klan . Christine , scarlet-robed and her eyes blind  --  folded with a black bandage , moves woodenly along . Behind the three come Zekiel and Ishma , with Giles behind them . All eyes of the congregation are fastened on the trio as they slowly advance toward the little mercy seat in front of the podium . A brilliant spotlight floods in on the little bench in a tight enclosing circle . Here and there young people rise up to see better , and Sippiehaw Mogue , frightened , begins to blubber . His mother Letha pats him comfortingly on the shoulder , takes out a hand-sized cookie from her handbag and pacifies him . The two Dudd children Doremus and Ludie are also frightened and cling to their parents as they stare with big eyes at the hooded figures and the sinful woman . Mean-while the song has continued . ) Thou the sinful woman savest , Thou the dying thief forgavest , And to me a hope vouchsafest , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blestGrant her thy eternal rest.A-men . ( Without any pause of any gap , Zahab cries out. ) p. 77 ZAHAB Listen to the word ! ( He lifts the big open Bible from the lectern and holds it up . The voice of the narrator now speaks loudly and compellingly through the scene , and everyone sits motionless , awed and listening . ) NARRATIVE VOICE And the Book of Life shall be opened , and the dead shall be judged out of those things which are written in the Book . And the sea shall give up its dead , and hell shall deliver up them that are to be judged , every man accorgind to his works . And who soever is not found written in the Book of Life shall be cast into the lake of fire . ( The deacons have brought Christine to the edge of the little circle around the mercy seat .

She stands there in her white bridal-like dress Cries of joy and thanksgiving break out among the people , the song never slackening. ) p. 80 VOICES Hallelujah ! OTHER VOICES Praise God ! She is repenting ! STILL OTHERS She will be saved ! ( Zahab throws the scarlet robe down and puts his foot on it , then points for Christine to kneel .

The religious fervor has not yet seized him , but he is obviously affected by it , even as he keeps looking concernedly toward the immobile Christine .
