" We do n't want a reversal on this case , as we 've had in the recent past , because of anything that 's been published that is prejudicial to a fair trial . " With these cautionary words to reporters . Illinois Judge Herbert Paschen prepared to preside over the trial of Richard Speck , the 25-year-old ex-seaman who is accused of the savage and systematic murders of eight young student nurses in Chicago last July . To head off what he thought might be sensational press coverage . Judge Paschen set down some unusually specific restrictions on what newsmen could do and print . In 14 carefully worded directives , reporters were forbidden to carry or use any kind of camera , tape recorder or other electronic equipment in the courthouse : to make courtroom sketches of anyone involved in the trial : to leave or enter the courtroom while the trial was in session : or to publish the names of any juror , whether empaneled or excused , until after the verdict . Witnesses , jurors , lawyers and anyone else officially connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and court stenographers were prohibited from making a copy of the record available to anyone but the prosecuting and defense attorneys . Finally , only 27 newsmen were accredited by the court and given reserved seats each day . Unaccustomed to such curbs , reporters and editors objected . The Chicago Tribune filed suit in Illinois Supreme Court to have the judge overruled , headlined its story : TRIBUNE FIGHTS COURT GAG . The rulese were a bit stiff-and in a few cases even silly . And after listening to the protests , Judge Paschen eased up on some points . The names of excused jurors could be printed , and a copy of the court record could be obtained each evening during the trial proper . As the selection of the jurors began last week in Peoria , it was also clear that reporters could leave and return during sessions as long as they did not stampede . After five days of effort , not a single juror had been empaneled. , while 121 had been dismissed . Many objected to the death penalty , but the most frequent reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by pretrial publicity .
