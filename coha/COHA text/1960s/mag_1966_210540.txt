The Japanese housewife used to be a timid , tittering soul who knelt obediently at her husband 's feet and spoke only when spoken to . But the women have now organized , and they can be a formidable power . This became painfully clear to the government last week when Miss Tsuruko Haruno , vice president of the Housewives Association of Japan , glared through her bifocals and charged that the Japanese family was about to be taken to the cleaners . <P> The ladies had a point . In the past three years , one of the few bright spots in Japan 's inflation-ridden economy has been the cost of dry cleaning , and the thanks are due to some 1,500 enterprising operators who installed automatic dry-cleaning equipment and cut prices almost in half ( from 970 to 560 for a man 's suit ) . Now , charged the redoubtable Miss Haruno , the traditional dry-cleaning establishments-through their organization , the National Federation of Cleaning and Environmental Sanitation Associations-were trying to lobby the upstarts out of business . The Japanese Diet , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automated shops to adopt a variety of expensive " sanitation " measures , and hire unneeded engineering technicians to watch the operation of the machines . <P> The bill never got through . The housewives ' campaign was quickly taken up by the Tokyo press , and soon block headlines and black editorials were condemning the dry cleaners ' lobby . The furor hit Premier Eisaku Sato , whose popularity keeps dropping as prices keep rising , where it hurt most . Worried about the latest opinion polls , which showed that only 28.8% of the Japanese public supports him , Sato warned his party leaders to " proceed slowly " on the bill-which in his language meant drop it . Economic Planner Aiichiro Fujiyama chimed in to say that it should be " studied further " - which in his language meant drop it immediately . The bill was quietly dropped . <P> Euphoric , Miss Haruno promptly set off on a victory tour of shops using automatic dry-cleaning equipment . " Listen to those machines , " she crowed . " They sound like the three cheers of banzai. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
