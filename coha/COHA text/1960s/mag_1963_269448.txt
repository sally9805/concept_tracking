Despite the fact that one New York paper was ready to quit fighting and start publishing ( see above ) , the city 's 13-week-old newspaper strike seemed to go on and on . And despite the fact that Cleveland 's unions were anxious to settle , Cleveland 's 14-week-old strike also seemed endless . But neither city has anything on Portland , Ore . There , an almost forgotten dispute has dragged on since November 1959 , and is not one pica closer to settlement than it was when it began . But unlike New York or Cleveland , Portland has not been without its newspapers for one strikebound day . It is , in fact , the only U.S. city that ever went into a strike with two dailies-the Oregonian and the Oregon Journal-and wound up with three . The newcomer is the tabloid Reporter , a strike-born paper that was first published by union members in February 1960 . <P> Little David . The Reporter 's survival is a measure of the bitterness of Port land 's strike , which began with a stereotypers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was soon punctuated by picket-line brawls and the dynamiting of newspaper delivery vans . Every other strike paper that has been started in the U.S. in the last 30 years-nearly a score in all-has done a quick fadeout as soon as the regulars returned to the newsstands . In Portland the regulars never really left ; for six months they published a joint , typo-marred paper ; then they hired enough nonunion help to resume separate operations . <P> To keep the Reporter going in the face of this determined opposition , the newspaper unions dug deep into their treasuries . Eighty Portland locals put up $150,000 to buy and remodel an abandoned Wells Fargo stable ; the hayloft still serves as the Reporter 's city room . The International Typographical Union shipped sev eral carloads of equipment from Miami , including an ancient Hoe press that was dubbed " Little David , " and leased the whole lot to the Reporter for a token $10 a year . <P> With a circulation of just under 60,000 , the Reporter has given its rivals little room for complacency . Since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is down 28,600 to 213,614 , the Journal a whopping 57,300 to 131,364 . Both have resorted to giving away stuffed Easter bunnies and toy elephants to lure their readers back . <P> Pointless Sacrifice . Little David &; Co. have not done badly for a slingshot operation , but fact is that they have barely pricked the hides of Portland 's Goliaths . Since Newspaper Collector Samuel Newhouse added the money-losing Journal to his chain in 1961 , he has been consolidating its noneditorial operations with those of the Oregonian ( which he bought in 1950 ) , and claims to be confident of eventually turning a profit . The Oregonian has slashed its noneditorial manpower by 30% , is so fat with ads that it shows a profit of more than $1,000,000 a year . <P> The Reporter , in the meantime , has run up a deficit of more than $536,000 despite the fact that it can get away with penny-pinching salaries , since 132 of its 283 employees still draw strike benefits from the I.T.U. and the Stereotypers ' Union ; the American Newspaper Guild shelled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
