In the age of Disneyland and Freedomland , could Texas be far behind ? Yup . as a matter of fact . But now , on a 35-acre site halfway between Dallas and Fort Worth , a ten-gallon version of the modern , thematic amusement park has just opened to the public . The theme , of course , is TEXAS , mister , hubris spelled out in smoke signals ; and the name of the place was originally Texas Under Six Flags . But that just would not do . " Texas , " someone pointed out , " is under nothin ' . " So , as thousands of children and adults turned up to see what the new $10 million park was like , they entered beneath a sign that said : Six Flags Over Texas . <P> The new park is circumscribed by a narrow-gauge railway , crossed by a 350-yard " Astrolift , " and subdivided topically into six sections : Spain , France , Mexico , Republic of Texas , the Confederacy , and the U.S. , representing Texas history , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domination . As in Anaheim and The Bronx , river boats are caught in rifle crossfire and nearly clobbered by beaver-felled trees , but Six Flags is no mere copy . Typically , the roofs of the train cars are titanic sombreros , a giant stuffed bull shaves past an overgrown matador , and landscapers have turned a Texas-sized swamp into " Xochimilco , " the lake garden near Mexico City . Coming closer to home , an Indian chief holds storytelling sessions . No-good varmints hold up the bank , the post office , the train , the stagecoach ride ; and the legendary Judge Roy Bean administers his rule of " Law West of the Pecos , " calling for the noose and provoking jail breaks . When amidst such adventuring a kid gets lost , he is sent to the Johnson 's Creek School , where he has to sit at a slant-top desk until his parents reclaim him . <P> Built by Dallas Real Estate Developer Angus Wynne Jr. , Six Flags Over Texas will stay open six months of the year , and figures on drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million . Freedomland 1.5 million ) . In the first five days , 37,000 visitors stampeded the grounds . They toured the river in the French section with a Texas-twanging pilot ( " Good evening , mess amiss " ) , heard a red , white and blue band play the " Six Flags Over Texas " march 30 times a day , saw four hoodlums arrested after spilling soda pop out of the windows of the aerial lift . <P> For all this , children pay $2.25 , adults $2.75 , all rides included . And since no self-respectin ' Texan so much as pulls on a pair of boots unless they 're air-conditioned , all the waiting areas for the Six Flags rides are bathed in curtains of cool air . Moreover , up in the native oak trees are 103 electric fans so powerful that if they were all dipped into the Gulf at the same time , they would drive Texas six feet into New Mexico .
