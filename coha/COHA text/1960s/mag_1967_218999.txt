The soldier on the line in Viet Nam . <P> PETER K. BROS Alexandria , Va . <P> <P> Sir : Wretched Humanity , terrorized in China , Southern Arabia and Yemen ; dying of hunger in India and Palestine ; beset by war in Nigeria , the Near East and North and South Viet Nam ; stifling in slums and poverty the world over ; and enslaved in East Germany and countless other nations . <P> <P> ( MRS . ) EMILY BENDER <P> GIORGIANA BENDER Vienna <P> Sir : The ghetto rioter and the hippie . One is protesting that he does not have , the other is turning away from what he has . Future historians might wonder why they did n't exchange places . <P> <P> ( MRS . ) BETTY C. CHARLES Sedalia , Mo . <P> <P> Sir : Harold Holt , who made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the closest friendly ally of the U.S. <P> <P> MICHAEL J. BUCKLEY Sydney <P> Sir : Representative Wilbur C. Mills , who may have kept America from sinking farther into a British-like welfare-state morass-and saved the value of our dollar . ( MRS . ) PATRICIA C.

McCoRMiCK Tarrytown , N.Y . <P> <P> Tossing Thunder Eggs <P> Sir : Not as a parent but as a teacher , I can attest to the thesis of your Essay , <P> " On Being an American Parent " Dec. 15 , that today 's pampered youth yearn for discipline ; finding it withheld at home , they often seek it in the classroom . Although it 's In to complain about assignments and deadlines , most students , not yet ready for independence , find security in this kind of regimentation . Many a class troublemaker who harasses his teacher is selfconsciously pursuing a reprimand . I recall one unruly college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I shall never forget : " I know my behavior is lousy . Can you make me stop ? " Yes , I probably can , but is it my job ? <P> NANCY SEFTON Portola Valley , Calif . <P>
