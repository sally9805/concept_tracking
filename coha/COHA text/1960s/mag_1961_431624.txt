 | Let 's Look at Those " Alarming " Unemployment Figures @# @# FOR MONTHS the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has been pouring out a stream of doleful figures depicting the worst " unemployment crisis " in the United States since the Great Depression of the 1930 's . Almost daily some administration official tells us that nearly seven percent of our labor force is out of work . Meanwhile , Congress has passed one emergency spending bill after another on the ground , in part or in whole , that it will help employment . ( It is estimated that this legislation will add 18 billion dollars to the annual cost of our federal government over the next few years . ) All this unemployment news out of Washington provides excellent ( odder for the communist line , of course . Said The Communist Worker recently , " Only in the socialistread communist countries are there no crises , no mass layoffs , no unemployment . Only when social-ism is adopted in the United States will such crises be done away with . " Clearly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real facts behind the unemployment headlines . Fact No. 1 is this : The unemployment " crisis " rests on the credibility of the monthly unemployment report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics . Through the years the definitions and methods used by BLS to obtain its figures have steadily been altered to magnify the unemployment problem . The U.S. unemployment total is not an actual count but an estimate obtained through a " probability sample " akin to a public-opinion poll . Once a month 550 part-time Census Bureau enumerators visit 35,000 households selected as repre-  | sentative of the United States economically , geographically and socially . They ask a few questions such as , " How many people here want a job ? " They list as " employed " all residents over 14 who had a job the previous week ; as " unemployed " those not working the week before but looking for work ; and as " not in the labor force " those not working and not looking for jobs . On the average , each answer is multiplied by 1400 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the U.S. population . Originally , a person was classed as " looking for work " only if he actually looked . Then , in the 1930 's , it was decided that this was unfair to non-lookers , because they were discouraged by the " lack of job opportunities . " In 1940 , therefore , Washington started classifying anybody who wanted a job as looking for work , even if he said he had not looked because he was sick or " guessed " that no work was available . These " inactive " unemployed were separately identified until 1945 . Then BLS gave up making any distinction between active and inactive unemployed , and encouraged enumerators to classify non-lookers as unemployed rather than " irritate " interviewees by asking further questions . This gave enumerators free rein to use their own discretion as to how many persons in a household who were not at work were actually " unemployed . " With such encouragement from the top , it is no wonder that enumerators have become increasingly skillful at finding " hidden unemployment . " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country turned up noticeably less unemployment than BLS was reporting . In 1950 the regular census takers found 20 percent less unemployment than BLS enumerators . In 1954 even more dramatic evidence of the degree to which the attitudes of the enumerators can cause a rise in the number of unemployed came to light . That year BLS revamped its field forces , dispersed the households to be interviewed over a larger sample area , and gave its new enumerators intensive training in sniffing out elusive cases of " marginal and occasional workers " who could be classified as unemployed . In their first month the new polling personnel found 3,100,000 Americans out of work , while the old enumerators found only 2,400 , 000 ? a difference of 700,000 or 22 percent ! Since the two groups agreed on the number of Americans working , the 22-percent spread between th " unemployed " figures was wholly attributable to the greater zeal of the new enumerators in classing borderline cases . BLS kept the more " efficient " new enumerators , let the others go . In addition to this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of categories in which th unemployment results from per sonal choice or at least is not depend 1961 THOSE " ALARMING " UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES 69  | ent on " economic factors beyond the individual 's control . " So classified , for example , are : persons temporarily unable to work at their jobs because of labor disputes in other industries ; persons who have quit their jobs to try to improve their economic status ; persons who have quit from dissatisfaction and have become floaters ; persons looking for part-time or temporary jobs to earn pin money ; persons who are actually unable to work , but who nevertheless try to find employment ; seasonal workers re-entering the labor market at the opening of the period of seasonal activity ; anybody who has obtained a job to start within the next 30 days . A review of the last 20 years of the Bureau of Labor Statistics ' curious operations makes it clear that the claimed rise in unemployment from recession to recession has , to a large extent , been engineered . And now the process of juggling statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about to move another step forward : under study in Washington are strongly backed proposals to count as unemployed persons working less than 40 hours a week or working at less than top grade and salary . Why such a bureaucratic compulsion to classify people as unemployed ? The answer is this : under the Employment Act of 1946 , the federal government committed itself to a policy of promoting maximum employment and of setting forth such levels of employment as are needed to carry out the policy . Consequently , the worse unemployment grows ? or can be made to appear ? the easier it is to push Uncle Sam into new federal spending programs and new controls over the economy . Fact No. 2 : U.S. unemployment statistics can not be compared with those of the rest of the world . News stories frequently state , " While the United States worries about finding jobs for its five million unemployed , the concern of most other industrialized nations is to find enough workers to fill empty jobs . " But in Britain , France , West Germany , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( countries with lower reported unemployment rates than the United States ) , the official report of persons out of work is obtained through an actual count of persons who have registered themselves as looking for work in order to collect unemployment compensation . These individuals must report , sometimes daily , at government employment agencies to prove their availability to take a job . In these countries " marginal and occasional workers , " such as housewives , children and old people , are generally excluded from consideration. * Last May , when U.S. newspapers headlined " 5,000,000 Americans Out of Work , " Dr. Seymour Wolfbein , Deputy Assistant Secretary of La ? By contrast , the United States listed as unemployed last May 854,000 housewives living with their husbands , 876,000 teen-agers and 167,000 persons over the " retiring age " of 65.  | bor , told the New York Times : " If we applied the same measuring rod as Europe , our unemployed would he three million . " If Britain used our system , according to a recent study reported by the First National City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1959 Sweden gave the U.S. measuring plan a one-month trial . Sweden 's unemployment almost trebled . Comparisons with the Soviet Union are impossible . In 1930 , with the abolition of unemployment insurance and the adoption of a system of forced and assigned labor , the U.S.S.R. " solved " its unemployment problem simply by ceasing to report any statistics . Fact No. 3 : The United States has a fine employment story to tell , but it goes largely untold . Since World War II , the United States has been passing through what might be called a second Industrial Revolution . This is a revolution of increased productivity , and it has drastically affected the distribution pattern of the U.S. working force . Since 1947 , manufacturing output has gone up 6o percent , with only a ten-percent increase in the number of workers required . Farm production has soared to even greater heights in spite of a 3opercent decline in the number of farm workers . The slack has been taken up by a 4o-percent increase in the number of Americans in white-collar occupations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enviable position of having more work performing services than producing goods . And since 1947 we 've t creased the number of gainful employed workers from 58 million to nearly 67 million ( an average one and a half jobs per family ) . ' I latest report shows a record family income of $6900 a year . True , some Americans have n been able to keep pace economical with the rest of the country . The are , for the most part : young people who fail to complete high school and so start with the less desirable jobs and reach a ceiling on advanc ment soonest ; manual laborers an unskilled workers who have bee caught in advancing automation Negroes who , starting with educ tional handicaps and discrimination in hiring , make up 20 percent c the unemployed ; workers in the 4 to-65 age group , who compose 4 percent of the long-term ( that is , out of work 15 weeks or more ) unemployed ; those in depressed area left behind by the changing geography of U.S. industry ( West Virginia coal mines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) . From these ranks comes our " hard core " of unemployed . Fact No. 4 : Considerably more it being done about our hard-core problem than the news out of Washington would suggest . Each month the individual states , via their unemployment security programs ( from money obtained through pay-roll taxes on the working population ) , pay out in un1961 THOSE " ALARMING " UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES 71  | employment compensation average weekly individual stipends of $34 . This is far more than the working wage in most countries . More fundamental is the point that present projections show that 70 percent of the 26 million young people growing up in the 1960 's will have high-school educations or better . This compares with 6o percent of the more than 15 million who matured in the 1950 's . That is the local taxpayers ' contribution to the prevention of unemployment . For persons already caught up in unemployment , the cure is harder but not impossible . When Armour &; Co. closed down its Oklahoma City packing plant last year , the company offered free vocational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could pass an aptitude test conducted by the State Employment Service , and could show a reasonable prospect of getting a job in the field they selected . Of these , 170 applied for and 6o enrolled in courses from typing to welding . Many wound up delighted with new jobs . Ford Motor Co. ' s long-established in-plant training program has been even more successful . Four years ago , Ford removed the age ceiling on employes eligible for four years of classroom instruction and supervised apprentice training ( at wages running to more than $3 an hour ) . It trains , on the average , 2000 mployes a month for skilled occupations . Of those who remain with Ford , many can expect to wind up in top jobs : two Ford plants now have managers who were $1-an-hour employes before entering the company school . Plans in the offing in Washington would supplement such company training programs with a revival of GI-style on-the-job training and a program of federal subsidies to students enrolled in vocational schools . Also planned , subject to Congressional approval , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one part of the country to migrate to areas where their abilities are needed . In addition , Congress has passed an aid-to-depressed-areas pill . THESE emergency actions should not overshadow the most needed action of all : the long-overdue reform of the government 's method of reporting unemployment . Before the January change of administration , President Eisenhower 's Budget Director , Maurice Stans , personally inserted in the Labor Department 's budget a $300,000 appropriation request to conduct a " study in depth " to discover how many of the reported unemployed actually are in the market for jobs . Says Stans : " Modern governments are so heavily dependent upon statistics in making decisions that more and more national policies of immense importance for every American are determined by them . Billions of our dollars now ride on the accuracy of our monthly unemployment report . "
