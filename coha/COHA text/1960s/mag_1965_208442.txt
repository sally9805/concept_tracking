The long-awaited Viet Cong summer offensive at last seemed under way . <P> From the suburbs of Saigon to the rain forests around Danang , the Commu nists mounted a savage series of am bushes that snatched away the initiative from the government forces and killed more than 1,000 South Vietnamese troops . The deadliest assaults came in the Red-rife Central Highlands , with the Viet Cong attacking in battalion and even regiment strength as they swept down from the craggy Annamite chain . <P> " The V.C. are coming out of the bloody hills , " said one stunned American offi cer . They were indeed . <P> Thunder in the Compound . The bold est bit of Red butchery took place at Bagia , a tiny hamlet near Quangngai ( see map , opposite page ) , where three South Vietnamese battalions were mousetrapped and mowed down in the worst single battle of the war to date . <P> The Viet Cong - numbering nearly 1,000 - started slowly , by ambushing a single battalion engaged in a routine roadclearing operation . Then , as relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traps on the would-be rescuers . It was the same trick-in the same place-that had destroyed several French regiments in 1953 , just a year before Dienbienphu . Some of the ambushed government soldiers panicked , ripping off their uniforms and throwing away their weapons to hide out in hamlets and paddyfields . Those who surrendered received no mercy : many were found shot through the head and disemboweled . <P> The Communist intent was clearly to capture Quangngai , the provisional capital . And well they might have-except for a hot dose of U.S. airpower . The handful of government reserves held tight in Quangngai as a Red barrage from mortars , recoilless rifles and howitzers thundered against the Bagia redoubt . Reports from a detachment of montagnard mercenaries , who bravely scouted the area on bicycles , showed that the Viet Cong were less than a mile from the town . In the dark before dawn , monsoon clouds hung wet and heavy over Quangngai , but there was just enough room for a flight of C-123 " flareships " to sweep in under the ceiling and illuminate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skyraiders and helicopters , which lashed the perimeter with rockets , napalm , and cannon fire . Nonetheless , 500 government troops were killed at Bagia . <P> llyushins for Hanoi . Barely had the shock of the disaster worn off than the Viet Cong struck again-this time at Lethanh , a district capital in mountainous Pleiku province . In the initial assault , the Reds overran the town , held it for three hours while other Viet Cong units ambushed three relief convoys in succession at almost the same spot on the highway . The toll : 106 government soldiers dead , 20 wounded or missing . Other Viet Cong traps clanged shut near Kontum and Quin-hon , and a full battalion of Reds struck the town of Binhchanh , just ten miles west of Saigon . The defending Ranger company was saved by armed U.S. helicopters , but the very fact that the Communists could mount a battalion-sized assault that close to the capital left many military men shaken .                    @
