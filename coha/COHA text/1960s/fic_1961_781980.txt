 | " I did n't mean it that way . " " You 're small for thirteen . You look too frail for the heavy work of this studio . " " To draw one does not need big muscles . " He realized that he had been baited into saying the wrong thing , and that in addition he had raised his voice . The apprentices had turned at this contretemps . After a moment Ghirlandaio 's good nature asserted itself . " Very well , suppose you sketch for me . What will it be ? " Michelangelo 's eyes traveled over the workshop , swallowing impressions the way country youths break bunches of grapes in their mouths at autumn wine festivals . " Why not the studio ? " Ghirlandaio gave a short disparaging laugh , as though he had been rescued from an awkward position . " Granacci , give Buonarroti paper and charcoal . Now , if you have no objections , I will go back to my work . " Michelangelo found a point of vantage near the door from which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench to sketch . Granacci lingered by his side . " Why did you have to suggest such a difficult theme ? Take plenty of time . He 'll forget you 're here ... " His eye and hand were good working partners , grasping the essentials of the large room : the worktable in the center with its apprentices on both sides , Ghirlandaio on his platform under the north window . For the first time since entering the studio his breathing was normal . He felt someone leaning over his shoulder . " I 'm not finished , " he said . " It is enough . " Ghirlandaio took the paper , studied it for a moment . " You have worked at another studio ! Was it Rosselli 's ? " Michelangelo knew of Ghirlandaio 's dislike of Rosselli , who conducted the only other painters ' workshop in Florence . Seven years before Ghirlandaio , Botticelli and Rosselli had been called to Rome by Pope Sixtus IV to create wall panels for the newly completed Sistine Chapel . Rosselli had caught the pontiff 's eye by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every cloud , drapery and tree with gold , and won the coveted prize money . The boy shook his head no . " I 've drawn in school when Master Urbino was n't looking . And I 've copied after Giotto in Santa Croce , after Masaccio in the Carmine ... " Mollified , Ghirlandaio said , " Granacci was right . You have a strong fist . " Michelangelo held his hand in front of him , turning it from back to palm . " It is a stonecutter 's hand , " he replied proudly . " We have little need for stonecutters in a fresco studio . I 'll start you as  | an apprentice , but on the same terms as though you were ten . You must pay inc six florins for the first year . . " " I can pay you nothing . " , Ghirlandaio looked at him sharply . " The Buonarroti are not poor country people . Since your father wants you apprenticed ... " " My father has beat me every time I mentioned painting . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Apothecaries ( : wild agreement . Why will he not beat you again when you tell him ? " " Because your willingness to accept me will be a defense . That , and the fact that you will pay him six florins the first year , eight the second , and ten the third . " Ghirlandaio 's eyelids flared . " That 's unheard of ! Paying money for the privilege of teaching you ! " " Then I can not come to work for you . It is the only way . " The color grinder was twirling his pestle idly in the air while he gazed over his shoulder at the scene . The apprentices at the table made no pretense of working . The master and would-be apprentice had reversed positions as though it were Ghirlandaio who , needing and wanting Michelangelo , had sent for him . Michelangelo could see the " No " beginning to take form on Ghirlandaio 's lips . He stood his ground , his manner respectful both to the older man and to himself , gazing straight at Ghirlandaio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should do . I will be worth it to you . " Had he shown the slightest weakness Ghirlandaio would have turned his back on him . But before this solid confrontation the artist felt a grudging admiration . He lived up to his reputation of being a man " lovable and loved " by saying : " It 's obvious we shall never get the Tornabuoni choir finished without your invaluable help . Bring your father in . " Out on the Via dei Tavolini once again , with the early morning merchants and shoppers swirling about them , Granacci threw an arm affectionately about the smaller boy 's shoulder . " You broke every rule . But you got in ! " Michelangelo flashed his friend one of his rare warming smiles , the ambercolored eyes with their yellow and blue specks sparkling . The smile accomplished the redesigning for which his crayon had groped earlier in front of the bedroom mirror : when parted in a happy smile his lips were full , revealing strong white teeth , and his chin thrusting forward achieved sculptural symmetry with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family house of the poet Dante Alighieri and the stone church of the Badia was for Michelangelo like walking through a gallery : for the Tuscan treats stone with the tenderness that a lover reserves for his sweetheart . From the time of their Etruscan ancestors the people of Fiesole , Settignano and Florence had been quarrying stone from the mountains , hauling it by oxen to their land , cutting , edging , shaping and building it into homes and palaces , churches and loggias , forts and walls . Stone was one of the richest fruits of the Tuscan earth . From childhood they knew its feel and smell , the flavor of its outer shell as well as its inner meat ; how it behaved in the hot sun , in the rain , in the full moonlight , in the icy tramontana wind . For fifteen hundred years their ancestors had worked the native pietra serena , serene stone , building a city of such breath-taking beauty that Michelangelo and generations before him cried : " Never shall I live out of sight of the Duomo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground floor of the house the Buonarroti clan rented in the Via dell'Anguillara . " A rivederci , as the fox said to the furrier , " Granacci twitted . " Oh , I 'll take a skinning , " he responded grimly , " but unlike the fox I shall come out alive . " He turned the sharp corner of Via dei Bentaccordi , waved to the two horses whose heads were sticking out of the open-top door of the stable across the street , and climbed the rear staircase to the family kitchen . His stepmother was making her beloved torte : the chickens had been fried in oil earlier in the morning , ground into sausage with onions , parsley , eggs and saffron . Ham and pork had been made into ravioli with cheese , flour , clove , ginger , and laid with the chicken sausage between layers of pastry , dates and almonds . The whole dish had then been shaped into a pie and was being covered with dough , preparatory to being placed in the hot embers to bake . " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have something special for you today : a salad that sings in the mouth . " Lucrezia di Antonio di Sandro Uhaldini da Gagliano 's name was longer than the written list of her dowry ; else why should so young a woman marry a forty-three-year-old graying widower with five sons , and cook for a household of nine Buonarroti ? Each morning she rose at four o'clock in order to reach the market square at the same time the contadini arrived through the cobbled streets with their pony carts filled with fresh fruits and vegetables , eggs and cheese , meats and poultry . If she did not actually help the peasants unload , at  | least she lightened their burden by selecting while the produce was still in the air and before it had a chance to settle in the stalls : the tenderest , slender green beans and piselli , peas , unblemished figs , peaches . Michelangelo and his four brothers called her Il Migliore , The Best , because every ingredient that went into her cooking had to be The Best . By dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She cared little about her clothing , paid no attention to her plain dark face with its suggestion of sideburns and mustache , the lackluster hair pulled tightly back from her brow . But as Michelangelo gazed at her flushed cheeks , the excitement in her eyes as she watched her torta baking , moving with authority and grace from the fire to her majolica jars of spices to sprinkle a fine dust of cinnamon and nutmeg over the crust , knowing every second of the seven-hour morning precisely where she was on schedule , he saw that she exuded radiance . He knew his stepmother to be a docile creature in every phase of her marriage except the kitchen ; here she was a lioness in the best fighting tradition of the Marzocco , Florence 's guardian lion . Wealthy Florence was supplied with exotic foods from all over the world : aloes , zedoary , cardamom , thyme , marjoram , mushrooms and truffles , powdered nuts , galinga . Alas ! they cost money to buy . Michelangelo , who shared the bedroom with his four brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents ' predawn debates while his stepmother dressed for marketing . " Everyday you want a bale of herrings and a thousand oranges . " " Lodovico , stop cutting costs with a cheese parer . You are one who would keep money in the purse and hunger in the belly . " " Hunger ! No Buonarroti has missed his dinner in three hundred years . Each week do n't I bring you in a fresh veal from Settignano ? " " Why should we eat veal every day when the markets are full of suckling pig and pigeon ? " On those days that Lodovico lost he gloomed over the account books , certain that he would not be able to swallow a bite of the bramangiere of fowls , almonds , lard , sugar , cloves and expensive rice with which his young irresponsible wife was ruining him . But slowly , as the fragrances seeped under the door of the kitchen , through the family sitting room and into his study , it would eat away his fears , his anger , his frustration ; and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prodigious dinner , then push his chair back from the table , slap his bulging viscera with widespread fingers and exclaim the one sentence without which the Tuscan 's day is drear and futile : " Ho mangiato bene ! I have eaten well ! " With this tribute Lucrezia put away the remains for a light evening supper , set her slavey to wash the dishes and pots , went upstairs and slept until dark , her day complete , her joy spent . Not so Lodovico , who now went through the inverse process of the morning 's seduction . As the hours passed and the food was digested , as the mem-  | ory of the delicious flavors receded , the gnawing question of how much the elaborate dinner had cost began eating at him and he was angry all over again . Michelangelo walked through the empty family room with its heavy oak bench facing the fireplace , the six-foot bellows propped against the stone , its wall chairs with leather backs and leather seats : all prodigal pieces that had been made by the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Via dei Bentaccordi and the stables , was his father 's study , for which Lodovico had had built in the downstairs carpenter shop a triangular desk to fit into the forty-five-degree angle caused by the joining of the two streets at this end curve of the old colosseum . Here Lodovico sat cramped over his gray parchment account books . As long as Michelangelo could remember , his father 's sole activity had been a concentration on how to avoid spending money , and how to retain the ragged remnants of the Buonarroti fortune , which had been founded in 1250 and had now shrunk to a tenacre farm in Settignano and a house with a legally disputed title close by this one which they rented . Lodovico heard his son come in and looked up . Nature had been opulent to him in only one gift , his hair : since it grew freely he sported a luxurious mustache which flowed into his beard , cut square four inches below his chin . The hair was streaked with gray ; across the forehead were four deep straight lines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and family records . His small brown eyes were melancholy with tracing the lost fortunes of the Buonarroti . Michelangelo knew his father as a cautious man who locked the door with three keys . " Good morning , messer padre . " Lodovico sighed : " I was born too late . One hundred years ago the Buonarroti vines were tied with sausages . " Michelangelo watched his father as he sank into his work-reverie of the Buonarroti records , the Old Testament of his life . Lodovico knew to the last florin how much each Buonarroti generation had owned of land , houses , business , gold . This family history was his occupation , and each of his sons in turn had to memorize the legend . " We are noble burghers , " Lodovico told them . " Our family is as old as the Medici , Strozzi or Tornabuoni . The Buonarroti name has lasted three hundred years with us . " His voice rose with energy and pride . " We have been paying taxes in Florence for three centuries . " Mic  --  hclangelo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission , had to bow when given an order . It had been duty rather than interest that led t he boy to learn that when the Guelphs took over power in Florence in the middle of the thirteenth century their family rose rapidly : in 126o a luonarroti was councilor for the Guelph army ; in 1392 a captain of the Guelph party ; from 1343 to 1469 a Buonarroti had ten times been a mein-  | ber of the Florentine Priori or City Council , the most honored position in the city ; between 1326 and 1475 eight Buonarroti had been gonfaloniere or mayor of the Santa Croce quarter ; between 1375 and 1473 twelve had been among the buonuomini or Council of Santa Croce , including Lodovico and his brother Francesco , who were appointed in 1473 . The last official recognition of the waning Buonarroti family had taken place thirteen years before , in 1474 , when Lodovico had been appointed podesta , or outside visiting mayor , for the combined hamlets of Caprese and Chiusi di Verna , high in the rugged Apennines , where Michelangelo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's six months ' residence . Michelangelo had been taught by his father that labor was beneath a noble burgher ; but it was the son 's observation that Lodovico worked harder in figuring out ways not to spend money than he would have had to work in earning it . Within the Buonarroti fortress there had remained a few scattered resources , enough to let him eke out his life as a gentleman providing he spent nothing . Yet in spite of all the skill and dedication Lodovico brought to his task their capital had dribbled away . Standing in the recessed wall of the eight-foot window , letting the thin March sun warm his bony shoulders , the boy 's image went back to their home in Settignano , overlooking the valley of the Arno , when his mother had been alive . Then there had been love and laughter ; but his mother had died when he was six , and his father had retreated in despair into the encampment of his study . For four years while his aunt Cassandra had taken over the care of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his grandmother , Monna Alessandra , who lived with them , and the stonecutter 's family across the hill , the stonecutter 's wife having suckled him when his own mother had been too ill to nourish her son . For four years , until his father had remarried and Lucrezia had insisted that they move into Florence , he had fled at every opportunity to the Topolinos . He would make his way down the wheat fields among the silvergreen olives , cross the brook which marked the division of the land , and climb the opposite hill through the vineyards to their yard . Here he would silently set to work cutting the pietra serena from the neighboring quarry into beveled building stones for a new Florentine palace , working out his unhappiness in the precision blows in which he had been trained in this stonecutter 's yard since he was a child and , along with the stonecutter 's own sons , had been given a small hammer and chisel to work scraps . Michelangelo pulled himself back from the stonecutter 's yard in Settignano to this stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have just come from Domenico Ghirlandaio 's studio . Ghirlandaio has agreed to sign me as an apprentice . "  | During the silence that pulsed between them Michelangelo heard one of the horses neigh across the street and Lucrezia stir the embers of her fire in the kitchen . Lodovico used both hands to raise himself to a commanding position over the boy . This inexplicable desire of his son 's to become an artisan could be the final push that would topple the shaky Buonarroti into the social abyss . " Michelangelo , I apologize for being obliged to apprentice you to the Wool Guild and force you to become a merchant rather than a gentleman . 11 But I sent you to an expensive school , paid out money I could ill afford so 11 that you would be educated and rise in the Guild until you had your own mills and shops . That was how most of the great Florentine fortunes were started , even the Medici 's . " Lodovico 's voice rose . " Do you think that I will now allow you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the family name ! For three hundred years no Buonarroti has fallen so low as to work with his hands . " " That is true . We have been usurers , " angrily responded the boy . " We belong to the Money Changers Guild , one of the most respectable in Florence . Moneylending is an honorable profession . " Michelangelo sought refuge in humor . " Have you ever watched Uncle Francesco fold up his counter outside Orsanmichele when it starts to rain ? You never saw anyone work faster with his hands . " At the mention of his name Uncle Francesco came running into the room . He was a larger man than Lodovico , with a brighter countenance ; the working half of the Buonarroti partnership . Two years before he had broken away from Lodovico , made considerable money , bought houses and set himself up in style , only to be lured into a bad investment in foreign currencies , lose everything and have to move back into his brother 's house . Now when it rained he scooped up his velvet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coins from between his feet and ran through the wet streets to his friend , Amatore the cloth cutter , who allowed him to set up his table ender cover . Francesco said in a hoarse voice : " Michelangelo , you could n't see a crow in a bowlful of milk ! What pervcrsc pleasure can you derive from injuring the Buonarroti ? " The boy was furious at the accusation. " 1 have as much pride in our name as anyone . Why ca n't I learn to do fine work that all Florence will be proud of , as they are of Ghiberti 's doors and I ) onatello 's sculptures and Ghirlandaio 's frescoes ? Florence is a good city for an artist . "  | Lodovico put his hand on the boy 's shoulder , calling him Michelangolo , his pet name . This was his favorite of the five sons , for whom he had the highest hopes ; it was this affection that had given him courage to spend money for three years of schooling at Urbino 's . The master had been too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son had preferred drawing in his notebooks to learning his letters from the collection of Greek and Latin manuscripts . As for rhetoric , the boy had been bound by his own rules of logic which the persuasive Urbino had been unable to alter . " Michelagnolo , the things you say about artists are as true as the word of a bench-talker . I 've been too angry at your stupidity to do anything but beat you . But you 're thirteen now ; I 've paid for your training in logic , so I should practice logic with you . Ghiberti and Donatello began as artisans and ended as artisans . So will Ghirlandaio . Their work never raised their social position one braccio , an arm 's length , and Donatello was so destitute at the end of his life that Cosimo de ' Medici had to give him a charity pension . " The boy flared at this attack . " That 's because Donatello put all his money into a wire basket hung from the ceiling so his assistants and friends could help themselves when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like washing an ass 's head with lye , " observed Francesco , for the Tuscan 's wisdom is a web of proverbs ; " you lose both the effort and the lye . Every man thinks that rubble will turn into gold in his hand ! What kind of dreaming is that ? " " The only kind I know , " cried Michelangelo . He turned back to Lodovico . " Bleed me of art , and there wo n't be enough liquid left in me to spit . " " I prophesied that my Michelangelo would recoup the Buonarroti fortune , " cried Lodovico . " I should have spoken with a smaller mouth ! Now , I 'll teach you to be vulgar . " He started raining blows on the boy , his right elbow crooked stiffly so that he could use his arm as a club . Francesco , not wanting to fail his nephew in this critical moment of his youth , also began hitting the boy , boxing his ear with the heel of his palm . Michelangelo lowered his head as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point in running away , for then the argument would have to be resumed later . Deep in his throat he sounded the words of his grandmother : " Pazienza ! Patience ! No man is born into the world whose work is not born with him . " From the corner of his eye he saw his aunt Cassandra bulking in the doorway , a big-boned woman who seemed to put on flesh from the air she breathed . Cassandra of the enormous thighs , buttocks and bosom , with a voice that matched her weight , was an unhappy woman . Nor did she feel it her duty to dispense happiness . " Happiness , " said Aunt Cassandra , " is for the next world . " The boom of Aunt Cassandra 's voice demanding to know what was going  | on now hurt his ear more than her husband 's palm . Then , suddenly , all words and blows stopped and he knew that his grandmother had entered the room . She was a retiring woman in black , not beautiful but with a finely modeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family crisis . Lodovico did not like to give his mother offense . He slumped into his chair . " That 's the end of the discussion ! " he announced . " I have brought you up not to crave the whole world ; it is enough to make money and serve the Buonarroti name . Never let me hear again about this being apprenticed to artists . " Michelangelo was glad that his stepmother was too deeply involved in her torta to permit her to leave the kitchen ; the room was too crowded now for more spectators . Monna Alessandra went to her son 's side at the account desk . " What difference does it make whether he joins the Wool Guild and twists wool or the Apothecaries Guild and mixes paints ? You wo n't leave enough money to set up five geese , let alone sons . " Iler voice was without reproach ; had it not been her husband , Lionardo Buonarroti , whose bad judgment and bad luck began the downfall of the family ? " All five boys must look to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wishes , and Michelangelo into a studio . Since we can no longer help them , why hinder them ? " " I am going to be apprenticed to Ghirlandaio , Father . You must sign the papers . I 'll do well by us all . " Lodovico stared at his son in disbelief . Was he possessed by an evil spirit ? Should he take him to Arezzo and have him exorcised ? " Michelangelo , you are saying things that make me swell up a dozen times in anger . " He shot his last and crushing bolt . " We have not a scudo to pay for any apprenticeship to Ghirlandaio . " This was the moment for which Michelangelo had been waiting . He said gently : ' " There is no need for money , padre . Ghirlandaio has agreed to pay you for my apprenticeship . " " 1 lc will pay ! " L.odovico lunged forward . " Why should he pay me for the privilege of teaching you ? " " Because lie thinks I have a strong fist . " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair . " Except Cod keep us , we shall be destroyed . Truthfully , I do n't know whew you come from . Certainly not from the Buonarroti . All this must be your mother 's side , the Rueellai . " Ile spat out the name as though it were a mouthful of wormy apple . It was the first time Michelangelo could remember hearing the name spoken  | in the Buonarroti house . Lodovico crossed himself , more in perplexity than piety . " Truly I have conquered myself in more battles than a saint ! " 5 ? Domenico Ghirlandaio 's was the most bustling and successful bottega in all Italy . In addition to the twenty-five frescoed panels and lunettes for the ' I'ornabuoni choir at Santa Maria Novella , which had to be completed in the I wo years remaining of the five-year contract , he had also signed agreements to paint an Adoration of the Kings for the hospital of the Innocenti and to design a mosaic for over a portal of the cathedral . Every few days he made a trip on horseback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bing from a small altarpiece to the hall of a ducal palace . Ghirlandaio , who never sought a commission , could refuse none ; on Michelangelo 's first day iu the studio he told him : " If a peasant woman brings you a basket that she wants ornamented , do it as beautifully as you can , for in its modest way it is as important as a fresco on a palace wall . " Michelangelo found the place energetic but good-natured . Twenty-eightyear-old Sebastiano Mainardi , with long black hair cut to imitate Ghirlandaio 's , a pale , narrow face with a jutting bony nose and protruding teeth , was in charge of the apprentices ; he was Ghirlandaio 's brother-in-law , though not , insisted Jacopo dell'Indaco , imp son of a baker , through any willing of his own . " Ghirlandaio married him to his sister in order to keep him working for the family , " Jacopo told Michelangelo . " So be on your guard . " Like most of Jacopo 's deviltries , this one contained a kernel of truth : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained in the workshop of their father , an expert goldsmith who had originated a fashionable wreath , called a ghirlanda , which the Florentine women wore in their hair . I ) omenico 's two younger brothers , David and Benedetto , were also painters . Benedetto , a miniaturist , wanted to paint only the minute and precise aspects of a woman 's jewels or flowers ; David , the youngest , had signed the contract for the Santa Maria Novella along with his brother . Domenico Ghirlandaio had moved on from his father 's studio to that of lialdovinetti , the master of mosaics , where he had remained until he was twenty-one , leaving reluctantly to open his own studio . " Painting is drawing , and the true eternal painting is mosaic , " he declared , but since few wanted mosaics any more he had turned to fresco , becoming the greatest absorber and eclectic in Italy . He had learned everything that the earlier fresco paintcis , from the time of Cimabue , had to teach . In addition he added something peculiarly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Mainardi as a brother-in-law after the younger apprentice had helped him paint his masterly frescoes in the church at San Gimignano , a neighboring town of seventy-six towers . Mainardi , who now took Michelangelo in tow , was amazingly like Ghirlandaio : good-natured , talented , well trained in the studio of Verrocchio , loving above all things to paint , and agreeing with Ghirlandaio that it was the beauty and charm of a fresco that was important . Paintings had to tell j I a story , either from the Bible , religious history or Greek mythology , but it was not the painter 's function to look behind the meaning of that story , to search for its significance or judge its validity . " The purpose of painting , " explained Mainardi to his newest apprentice , " is to be decorative , to bring stories to life pictorially , to make people happy , yes , even with the sad pictures of the saints being martyred . Always remember that , Michelangelo , and you will become a successful painter . " VI If Mainardi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sixteen-year-old Jacopo , with the monkey-like face , was the ringleader . He had a gift for appearing to be busy without doing a lick of work . He welcomed the thirteen-year-old boy to the studio by warning him gravely : " Doing nothing else but hard work is not worthy of a good Christian . " Turning to the table of apprentices , he added exultantly , " Here in Florence we average nine holidays every month . Add Sundays to that and it means we only have to work every other day . " " I ca n't see that it makes any critical difference to you , Jacopo , " commented Granacci with a rare burn of acid . " You do n't work on workdays . " The two weeks flew by until the magic day of his contract signing and first pay dawned . Michelangelo suddenly realized how little he had done to 11 earn the two gold florins which would constitute his first advance . So far he had been used as an errand boy to pick up paints at the chemist 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wash it in a barrel with a running hose . Awakening while it was still dark outside , he climbed over his younger brother Buonarroto , sprang out of the bed , fumbled in the bed-bench for his long stockings and knee-length shirt . At the Bargello he passed under a body hanging from a hook in the cornice ; this must be the man who , failing to die when hanged two weeks before , had uttered such vengeful words that the eight magistrates had decided to hang him all over again . Ghirlandaio was surprised to find the boy on his doorstep so early and his buon giorno , good morning , was short . He had been working for days on a study of St. John Baptizing the Neophyte and was upset because he could not clarify his concept of Jesus . He was further annoyed when interrupted by his brother David with a batch of bills that needed paying . Domenico pushed the accounts aside with a brusque gesture of his left hand , continuing to draw irritatedly with his right .  | " Why ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone to do my painting ? " Michelangelo watched the scene with apprehension : would they forget what day it was ? Granacci saw his friend 's expression . He slipped off his bench , went to David , murmured something in his ear . David reached into the leather purse he kept hooked onto his wide belt , crossed the room to Michelangelo and handed him two florins and a contract book . Michelangelo quickly signed his name alongside the first payment , as stipulated in the Doctors and Apothecaries Agreement , then wrote the date : April 16 , 1488 Joy raced through his veins as he anticipated the moment when he would hand the florins to his father . Two florins were not the wealth of the Medici , but he hoped they would lighten the murky atmosphere around the Buonarroti house . Then he was aware of an enthusiastic hubbub among the apprentices and the voice of Jacopo saying : " It 's agreed , we draw from memory that gnome figure on the alley wall behind the bottega . The one who draws the most accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Granacci , Bugiardini , Tedesco , are you ready ? " Michelangelo felt a dull pain in the chest ; he was being left out . His had been a lonely childhood , he had had no intimate friend until Granacci recognized in his young neighbor a talent for drawing . So often he had been excluded from games . Why ? Because he had been small and sickly ? Because there was not enough laughter in him ? Because he communicated with difficulty ? He so desperately wanted to be included in the companionship of this young group ; but it did not come easy . At the end of his first week Granacci had had to teach him a lesson in getting along with one 's contemporaries . Thirteen-year-old , heavy-boned Giuliano Bugiardini , a simple-natured lad who had been friendly to Michelangelo from the moment he entered the studio , had done a practice study of a group of women . Bugiardini could not draw the human figure and had no interest in it . " What 's the use ? " he demanded . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seeing the sacklike outlines , Michelangelo had impulsively picked up a stub pen and made a number of quick strokes which had put limbs under the heavy dresses of the women and infused them with a sense of movement . Bugiardini blinked his heavy eyelids a few times to see his figures spring to life . He was free of envy and did not resent the corrections . It was the thirteen-year-old Cieco , who had been apprenticed to Ghirlandaio at the conventional age of ten , who had taken offense . The sharp-tongued Cieco cried out : " You 've been studying from a female nude model ! " " But there 's no such thing in Florence , " protested Michelangelo .  | Tedesco , rawboned redhead , fruit of an early invasion of Florence , asked in a voice edged with hostility , " Then how do you know about the movements of a woman 's breasts and thighs , that you can put real people under their clothes ? " " I watch the women picking beans in the fields , or walking along the road with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye sees , your hand can draw . " " Ghirlandaio is not going to like this ! " crowed Jacopo joyously . That evening Granacci said confidingly : " Be careful about raising jealousies . Cieco and Tedesco have been apprenticed for a long time . IIow could they sec any justice in your being able to draw better instinctively than they can after years of training ? Praise their work . Keep your own to yourself . " Now , at the apprentices ' table , Jacopo was completing the details of the game . " Time limit , ten minutes . The winner to be crowned champion and host . " " Why ca n't I compete , Jacopo ? " Michelangelo cried . Jacopo scowled . " You 're just a beginner , you could n't possibly win , and there would be no chance of your paying . It would n't be fair to the rest of us . " Stung , Michelangelo pleaded , " Let me join in , Jacopo . You 'll see , I wo n't do too badly . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't have a longer time . Everyone ready ? " Excitedly , Michelangelo picked up charcoal and paper and began hammering down the outlines of the gnarled figure , half youth , half satyr , which he had seen several times on the rear stone wall . He could summon lines from his memory the way the students at Urbino 's school had so miraculously brought forth verses of Homer 's Iliad or Virgil 's Aeneid when the master demanded them . " Time limit ! " cried Jacopo . " Line up your drawings , center of the table . " Michelangelo ran to the table , put his sketch in line , quickly scanned the other sheets . He was astonished at how unfamiliar , even incomplete they appeared . Jacopo stared at him with his mouth wide open . " I ca n't believe it . Look , everyone , Michelangelo has won ! " There were cries of congratulation . Cieco and Tedesco smiled at him for the first time since their argument . He glowed with pride . He was the newest apprentice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... . Buy everyone dinner ! His stomach sank as though he had swallowed his two gold florins. 1 le counted heads ; there were seven of them . They would consume two lifers of red wine , soup-of-the-country , roast veal , fruit .. . making a sizable hole in one of the gold pieces that he had waited for so eagerly to turn over to his father . On the way to the osteria , with the others rushing ahead laughing heartily  | among themselves , a loose thread began flapping in his mind . He ran the spool of his thoughts backward , fell in step beside Granacci . " I was gulled , was n't I ? " " Yes . " " Why did n't you warn me ? " " It 's part of the initiation . " " What will I tell my father ? " " If you had known , would you have made yourself draw badly ? " Michelangelo broke into a sheepish grin . " They could n't lose ! " There was no formal method of teaching at Ghirlandaio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaque which Ghirlandaio had nailed to the wall alongside his desk : The most perfect guide is nature . Continue without fail to draw something every day . Michelangelo had to learn from whatever task each man had at hand . No secrets were kept from him . Ghirlandaio created the over-all design , the composition within each panel and the harmonious relation of one panel to the many others . He did most of the important portraits , but the hundred others were distributed throughout the studio , sometimes several men working on a single figure and on a one-day spread of plaster . Where there was an excellent angle of visibility from the church , Ghirlandaio did the entire panel himself . Otherwise major portions were painted by Mainardi , Benedetto , Granacci and Bugiardini . On the lateral lunettes , which were hard to see , he let Cieco and Baldinelli , the other thirteen-year-old apprentice , practice . Michelangelo moved from table to table , doing odd jobs . No one had time to stop work to teach him . He watched Ghirlandaio complete a portrait of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then draw it for the cartoon of the Visitation panel . " Oil painting is for women , " Ghirlandaio said sarcastically . " But this figure will go well in the fresco . Never try to invent human beings , Michelangelo ; paint into your panels only those whom you have already drawn from life . " David and Benedetto shared with Mainardi a long table in the far corner of the studio . Benedetto never worked freehand . It seemed to Michelangelo that he paid more attention to the mathematical squares on the paper before him than to the individual character of the person portrayed .  | Nevertheless he was an expert with the instruments for squaring up . He told Michelangelo : " Remember that the face is divided in three parts : first , the hair and forehead , then the nose , then the chin and mouth . Now take the proportions of a man . I omit those of a woman because there is not one of them perfectly proportioned . The arm with the hand extends to the middle of the thigh . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight faces ; and equal to his width with the arms extended . Always remember that a man has on his left side one less rib than a woman . . . Michelangelo tried drawing to Benedetto 's geometric plan , with its plumb line and compass half circles , but the restriction was a coffin into which he could squeeze only dead bodies . Mainardi however had an accurate hand and a self-assurance that breathed life into his work . He had painted important parts of both lunettes and all the panels , and was working out a color pattern for the Adoration of the Magi . He showed Michelangelo how to tint flesh in tempera , going twice over the naked parts . " This first bed of color , particularly for young people with fresh complexions , must be tempered with the yolk of an egg of a city hen ; the red yolks of country hens are only fit to temper flesh colorings of old or dark persons . " From Mainardi , Michelangelo learned to let the green tint under the flesh colors be just visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the nose with a little pure white ; to outline the eyelids and lashes with black . From Jacopo he received not technical instruction but news of the city . Nothing nefarious was safe from Jacopo . He could pass by virtue all his life and never stumble over it , but his nose smelled out the nether side of human nature as instinctively as a bird smells manure . Jacopo was the town 's gossip gatherer and crier ; he made the daily rounds of the inns , the wine- and barbershops , the quarters of the prostitutes , the groups of old men sitting on stone benches before the palazzi , for they were the best purveyors of the town 's yarns and scandal . Each morning he walked to the workshop by a circuitous route which enabled him to tap all of his sources ; by the time he reached Ghirlandaio 's he had a shopping basketful of the night 's news : who had been cuckolded , who was going to be commissioned for what art project , who was about to be put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a manuscript copy of Cennini 's treatise on painting ; although Jacopo could not read a word , he sat on the apprentices ' table with his legs crossed under him , pretending to spell out the passages he I : ( l nicniorized : " As an artist your manner of living should always be regulated as if you were studying theology , philosophy , or any other science ; that is to say ,  | eating and drinking temperately at least twice a day . . . ; sparing and reserving your hand , saving it from fatigue caused by throwing stones or iron bars . There is still another cause , the occurrence of which may render your hand so unsteady that it will tremble and flutter more than leaves shaken by the wind , and this is frequenting too much the company of women . " Jacopo threw back his head and laughed froth bubbles at the ceiling , then turned upon the quite astonished Michelangelo , who knew less about women than he did of Ptolemy 's astronomy . " Now you know , Michelangelo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want the Ghirlandaio frescoes to tremble and flutter like leaves in the wind ! " Amiable , easygoing David had been well trained in enlarging to scale the individual sections and transferring them to the cartoon itself , which was the dimension of the church panel . This was not creative work , but it took skill . He demonstrated how to divide the small painting into squares and the cartoon into the same number of larger squares , how to copy the content of each small square into the corresponding square of the cartoon , pointing out how mistakes that were almost unnoticeable in the small drawing became obvious when blown up to cartoon size . Bugiardini , whose clumsy body made it appear that he would have trouble whitewashing his father 's barn , nevertheless managed to get a spiritual tension into his figures for the Visitation , even though they were not accurate anatomically . He made Michelangelo spend one whole dinner period sitting for a sketch . After two hours Bugiardini said , " Have a look at your portrait . I have already caught the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Bugiardini , you have painted me with one of my eyes on my temple ! Look at it ! " Bugiardini studied Michelangelo 's face , then his sketch . " It seems to me that your eye is exactly as I painted it , and so is your face . " " Then it must be a defect of nature , " responded the boy . Taking an indirect route home , Michelangelo and Granacci entered the Piazza della Signoria where a large crowd was gathered , and climbed the steps of the Loggia della Signoria . From here they could see into the ringhiera of the palace where an ambassador of the Turkish sultan , garbed in eggshell turban and flowing green robes , was presenting a giraffe to the councilmen of the Signoria . Michelangelo wished he could sketch the scene but , knowing that he could capture only a small part of its complexity , he complained to Granacci that he felt like a chessboard , with alternating black and white squares of information and ignorance . The next noon he ate sparingly of Lucrezia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now because the others were taking their riposo , afternoon nap . he had decided that he must study the drawing of his master .  | Under Ghirlandaio 's desk he found a bundle labeled Slaughter of the Innocents , took it to the apprentices ' table and spread out the dozens of sheets for the fresco . It seemed to him , poring over the finished fresco , that Ghirlandaio could not portray motion , for the soldiers with their swords upraised , the mothers and children running , created confusion and an emotional chaos in him . Yet these rough studies had simplicity and authority . He began copying the drawings and had made a half dozen sketches in quick succession when he felt someone standing behind him . IIe turned to find a disapproving frown on Ghirlandaio 's face . " Why are you plying into that bundle ? Who gave you permission ? " Michelangelo put down his charcoal , frightened . " I did n't think there was any secret about it . I want to learn . " He regained his composure . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to earn those gold florins . " The appeal to his logic served less to banish Ghirlandaio 's anger than the intensity in the boy 's eyes . " Very well . I 'll take some time with you now . " " Then teach me how to use a pen . " Ghirlandaio took his newest apprentice to his desk , cleared it and set up two corresponding sheets of paper . He handed Michelangelo a bluntnibbed pen , picked up another for himself , started crosshatching . " Here 's my calligraphy : circles for the eyes , angular tips for the nose , like I ; I this ; use the short nib to render a mouth and score the underlip . " Michelangelo followed the older man with quick movements of the hand , noting how Ghirlandaio in sketching a figure never bothered to finish the legs but tapered them down to nothing . Ghirlandaio could hang a convincing drapery on a figure with a few rapid strokes , do a woman holding up her dress with delicate grace , achieve a lyrical flow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures individuality and character . A look of rapture came over Michelangelo 's face . This was the happiest he had been . With pen in hand he was an artist , thinking out loud , probing his mind , searching his heart for what he felt and his hand for what it could discern about the object before him . He wanted to spend hours at this work desk , redrawing models from a hundred different angles . Ghirlandaio was aware of the eagerness in the boy 's face , the excitement in his hand . " Michelangelo , you must not draw for its own sake . This figure is not usable in a fresco . " Seeing how well his apprentice followed him , Ghirlandaio took from his desk two more of his drawings , an almost life-size study of the head of a smooth-checked , full-faced , wide-eyed and thoughtful man under thirty , with robust modeling , the drawing of the hair finely decorative ; the second , the baptism of a man within the choir of a Roman basilica , done with a beauty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching for the sheets . " You 've learned everything that Masaccio has to teach . " The blood drained from Ghirlandaio 's dark face ; had he been insulted , judged a copier ? But the boy 's voice was full of pride . Ghirlandaio was amused : the rawest apprentice was complimenting the master . He took the drawings from him . " Sketches are nothing , only the finished fresco counts . I shall destroy these . " They heard the voices of Cieco and Baldinelli outside the studio . Ghirlandaio got up from the desk , Michelangelo picked up his paper and new pen , quickly reassembled the bundle of the Slaughter of the Innocents , had it tied and back in its corner by the time the boys came into the room . Locked in the big drawer of his desk , Ghirlandaio kept a folio from which he studied and sketched while he was conceiving a new panel . Granacci told Michelangelo that it had taken Ghirlandaio years to assemble these drawings of men he considered masters : Taddeo Gaddi , Lorenzo Monaco , Era @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many others . Michelangelo had spent enthralled hours gazing at their altars and frescoes with which the city was lavishly endowed , but he had never seen any of the working studies . " Certainly not , " replied Ghirlandaio brusquely when Michelangelo asked him if he might see the portfolio . " But why not ? " cried Michelangelo desperately . Here was a golden opportunity to study the thinking and techniques of Florence 's finest draftsmen . " Every artist assembles his own portfolio , " said Ghirlandaio , " according to his own tastes and judgment . I have made my collection over a period of twenty-five years . You build your own . " A few days later Ghirlandaio was studying a sketch by Benozzo Gozzoli of a nude youth with a spear , when a committee of three men called for him to accompany them to a neighboring town . He failed to put the drawing back into the locked drawer . Waiting until the others had left for dinner , Michelangelo went to the desk , took up the Benozzo Gozzoli sketch . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy ; and an errant idea popped into his mind . Could he fool Ghirlandaio with it ? The sketch was thirty years old , the paper soiled and yellowing with age . He took some scraps into the back yard , ran his finger over the earth , experimented with rubbing the dirt along the grain of the paper . After a while he brought his copy out to the yard , and slowly began discoloring his own sheet . Old drawing paper had a smoky quality around the edges . He returned to the studio where a fire burned in the hearth , held his discolored scraps over the smoke for testing , and after a moment his copy of the youth . Then he put the imitation on Ghirlandaio 's desk and secreted the original .  | During the weeks he watched Ghirlandaio 's every move ; whenever the teacher failed to return a sketch to the portfolio , a Castagno , Signorelli or Verrocchio , the boy remained behind to make a reproduction . If it was late afternoon he would take the sheet home and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fire in the downstairs hearth and stain the paper the proper color . At the end of a month he had assembled a portfolio of a dozen fine sketches . At this rate his folio of master sketches would become as thick as Ghirlandaio 's . Ghirlandaio still came in early from dinner occasionally to give his apprentice an hour of instruction : in the use of black chalk ; how to work in silver point , and then to intensify the effect with white chalk . Michelangelo asked if they might sometimes draw from nude models . " Why should you want to learn to draw the nude when we must always paint it under drapes ? " demanded Ghirlandaio . " There are n't enough nudes in the Bible to make it profitable . " " There are the saints , " replied the boy ; " they have to be nude , nearly , when they are being shot with arrows or burned on a grill . " " True , but who wants anatomy in saints ? It gets in the way of spirit . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No . All of character that 's necessary to show can be done through the face . . . and perhaps the hands . No one has worked in nudes since the pagan Greeks . We have to paint for Christians . Besides , our bodies are ugly , misproportioned , full of boils , fever and excrement . A garden of palms and cypresses , oranges in bloom , an architectural design of a straight stone wall with steps running down to the sea . . . that is beauty . And noncontroversial . Painting should be charming , refreshing , lovely . Who can say that the human body is any of these things ? I like to draw figures walking delicately under their gowns . . . " " ... and I would like to draw them the way God made Adam . " With June the summer heat clamped down on Florence . The boy packed away his calzoni , long hose , and stuck his bare feet into sandals . He wore a light cotton shirt . The back doors of the studio were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the green-leafed trees . For the festival of San Giovanni the bottega was locked tight . Michelangelo rose early , and with his brothers walked down to the Arno , the river which flowed through the city , to swim and play in the mud-brown waters before he met his fellow apprentices at the rear of the Duomo . The piazza was covered by a broad blue awning sown with golden lilies to represent heaven . Each Guild had built its own cloud , high up in which sat its patron saint on a wooden frame thickly covered by wool , surrounded  | by lights and cherubs and sprinkled with tinsel stars . On lower iron branches were children dressed as angels , strapped on by waistbands . At the head of the procession came the cross of Santa Maria del Fiore , and behind it singing companies of wool shearers , shoemakers , bands of boys dressed in white , then giants on stilts six cubits high , hooded with fantastic masks , then twenty-two Towers mounted on carts and carrying actors who gave tableaux out of Scripture : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed Lucifer being cast out of heaven ; the Tower of Adam presented God Creating Adam and Eve , with the serpent making its entrance ; the Tower of Moses acted out the Delivery of the Law . To Michelangelo the tableaux seemed endless . He had never liked biblical plays and wanted to leave . Granacci , enchanted with the painted scenery , insisted on staying to the very end . Just as high mass was beginning in the Duomo a Bolognese was caught stealing purses and gold belt buckles from the worshipers jammed before the pulpit . The crowd in the church and piazza turned into an angry mob shouting , " Hang him ! Hang him ! " carrying the apprentices along with them to the quarters of the captain of the guard , where the thief was promptly hanged from a window . Later that day a tremendous wind and hailstorm struck the city , destroying the colorful tents , turning the racecourse for the patio into a marsh . Bugiardini , Cieco , Baldinelli , Michelangelo huddled inside the Baptistery doors . " This storm came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holy day , " cried Cieco . " No , no , it 's the other way round , " protested Bugiardini . " God sent the storm as punishment for our hanging a man on a religious holiday . " They turned to Michelangelo , who was studying the pure gold sculptures of Ghiberti 's second set of doors , their ten glorious panels populated layer upon layer by all the peoples , animals , cities , mountains , palaces of the Old Testament . " What do I think ? " Michelangelo said . " I think these doors are the gates of paradise . " At Ghirlandaio 's the Birth of St. John was ready to be transferred to the wall of Santa Maria Novella . Early as he arrived at the studio , Michelangelo found himself to be the last . His eyes opened wide at the excitement , with everyone bustling about , collecting cartoons , bundles of sketches , brushes , pots and bottles of color , buckets , sacks of sand and lime , pointing sticks . The materials were loaded on a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire studio with Ghirlandaio at its head like a commanding general and Michelangelo , as the newest apprentice , driving the cart through the Via del Sole to the Sign of the Sun , which meant they were entering the Santa Maria Novella parish . He guided the donkey to the  | right and found himself in the Piazza Santa Maria Novella , one of the oldest and most beautiful in the city . He pulled the donkey up short : in front of him loomed the church , which had stood uncompleted in its rustic brick from 1348 until Giovanni Rucellai , whom Michelangelo counted as an uncle , had had the good judgment to choose Leon Battista Alberti to design this facade of magnificent black and white marble . Michelangelo felt a quickening at the thought of the Rucellai family , the more so because he was not permitted to mention the name in the Buonarroti house . Though he had never been inside their palace on the Via delta Vigna Nuova , when passing by he always slowed his pace a little to see into the spacious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to study the architecture of Alberti , who had designed the stately building . Gangling Tedesco was the unloading foreman , gustily bossing the thirteen-year-olds in his moment of command . Michelangelo entered the bronze doors , a roll of sketches in his arms , and stood breathing the cool incenseheavy air . The church stretched before him in the form of an Egyptian cross ll over three hundred feet long , its three pointed ogive arches and rows of majestic pillars gradually decreasing in distance from each other as they approached the main altar behind which the Ghirlandaio studio had been working for three years . Its lateral walls were covered with bright murals ; immediately over Michelangelo 's bead stood Giotto 's wooden crucifix . He walked slowly up the main aisle , savoring every step , for it was like a journey through Italian art : Giotto , painter , sculptor , architect , who legend said had been discovered by Cimabue as a shepherd boy drawing on a rock , and brought into his studio to become the liberator of painting from its dark Byzantine lifelessness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and here on the left of the church Michelangelo saw the living , glowing evidence of his Trinity  --  Masaccio , arising from God alone knew where , began to paint and Florentine art was reborn . Across the nave to the left he saw a Brunelleschi crucifix ; the Strozzi family chapel with frescoes and sculptures by the Orcagna brothers ; the front of the major altar with its Ghiberti bronzes ; and then , as the epitome of all this magnificence , the Rucellai chapel , built by his own mother 's fani-11 ily in the middle of the thirteenth century when they had come into their fortune through a member of the family who had discovered in the Orient how to produce a beautiful red dye . Michelangelo had never been able to get himself to mount the few stairs leading to the Rucellai chapel , even though it contained the supreme art treasures of Santa Maria Novella . A grudging family loyalty had kept him out . Now Iliat Inc had made his break from the family and was going to work here in Santa Maria Novella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enter without feeling an intruder on that side of the family which after his mother 's death had cut all communication , caring nothing of what hap-  | pcued to the five sons of Francesca Rucellai del Sera , daughter of Honda RucelIai ? 1-Ie put down the package he was carrying and walked up the stairs , slowly . Once inside the chapel with its Cimabue Madonna and marble Virgin and Child by Nino Pisano , he fell to his knees ; for this was the very chapel where his mother 's mother had worshiped all through her youth , and where his mother had worshiped on those feast days of family reunion . Tears burned , then overflooded his eyes . He had been taught prayers but he had only mouthed the words . Now they sprang to his lips unbidden . Was he praying to the beautiful Madonnas or to his mother ? Was there t my a difference ? Had she not been very like the Madonnas above him ? Whatever vague memories he had of her melted into those of the Lady . he rose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers sentiently over the marble drapery . Then he turned and left the chapel . For a moment he stood on top of the stairs thinking of the contrast between his two families . The Rucellai had built this chapel around 1265 , at the same time that the Buonarroti had come into their wealth . The Rucellai had recognized the finest practitioners , almost the creators of their arts : Cimabue in painting , somewhere around the close of the thirteenth century , and Nino Pisano in 1365 . Even now , in 1488 , they were in friendly competition with the Medici for the marble sculptures being dug up in Greece , Sicily and Rome . The Buonarroti had never commissioned a chapel . Every family of similar wealth had done so . Why not they ? Behind the choir he could see his comrades loading supplies up on the scaffolding . Was it enough to say that it had happened because the Buonarroti were not and never had been religious ? Lodovico 's conversation was interlarded with religious expressions , but Monna Alessandra had said of her son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he does n't obey them . " The Buonarroti had always been bard men with a florin , sharing the native shrewdness about money and the fierce concentration in guarding it . Had the willingness to invest solely in houses and land , the only true source of wealth to a Tuscan , kept the Buonarroti from ever wasting a scudo on art ? Michelangelo could not remember having seen a painting or sculpture of the simplest nature in a Buonarroti house . This took considerable doing for a family of wealth living for three hundred years in the most creative city in the world , where even homes of modest means had religious works that had come down through the generations . He turned back for a last Iook at the frescoed walls of the Rucellai chapel , realizing with a sinking heart that the Buonarroti were not only stingy , they were enemies of art because they despised the men who created it .  | A shout from Bugiardini on the scaffolding called him . He found the entire studio moving in harmony . Bugiardini had put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hatching a rough surface on which he was now plastering the precise area to be painted that day . With Cieco , Baldinelli and Tedesco he took up the cartoon , which they held over the wet panel . Ghirlandaio pounced the lines of the figures onto the fresh intonaco with a pointed ivory stick , then gave the signal for it to be taken away . The young apprentices scrambled down the scaffolding , but Michelangelo remained to watch Ghirlandaio mix his mineral earth colors in little jars of water , squeeze his brush between his fingers and commence his painting . He had to work surely and swiftly , for his task had to be completed before the plaster dried that night . If he delayed , the unpainted plaster formed a crust from the air currents blowing through the church , and these portions would stain and grow moldy . If he had failed to gauge accurately how much he could do that day , the remaining dry plaster would have to be cut away the following morning , leaving a discernible seam . Retouching was forbidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would discolor the fresco , turn it black . Michelangelo stood on the scaffolding with a bucket of water , sprinkling the area just ahead of Ghirlandaio 's flying brush to keep it moist . He underli stood for the first time the truth of the saying that no coward ever attempted fresco . He watched Ghirlandaio moving boldly forward , painting the girl with the basket of ripe fruits on her head , the billowing gown then in fashion which made the Florentine girls look like carrying matrons . Next to him stood Mainardi , painting the two older , sedate aunts of the Tornabuoni family , come to visit Elisabeth . Benedetto was highest on the scaffold , painting the elaborate crossbeamed ceiling . Granacci had been assigned the serving girl in the center ; g I of the background , bringing in a tray to Elisabeth . David was working on Elisabeth reclining against the richly carved wooden bedboard . Bugiardini , who had been allotted the window and door frames , summoned Michelangelo to his side , flicking his fingers for him to sprinkle some water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just painted above Elisabeth 's head . " Have you ever seen a more beautiful window ? " he demanded . " Brilliant , Bugiardini , " replied Michelangelo . " Particularly the open space that we see through . " Bugiardini studied his work , puzzled but proud . ii " You like that part too ? Funny , I have n't painted it yet . " The climax of the panel was reached when Ghirlandaio , with Mainardi assisting , painted the exquisite young Giovanna Tornabuoni , elaborately robed with the richest of Florentine silks and jewels , gazing straight out at Ghirlandaio , not in the least interested in either Elisabeth , sitting up in her  | high-hacked bed , or John , suckling at the breast of another Tornabuoni beauty sitting on the bed-bench . The panel took five days of concentrated work . Michelangelo alone was not permitted to apply paint . He was torn : part of him felt that though he had been in the studio for only three months he was as qualified to work the wall as the other thirteen-year-olds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all of this feverish activity had nothing to do with him . Even when he felt most unhappy about being excluded , he wanted to run out of the choir and the studio to a world of his own . Toward the end of the week the plaster began to dry . The burnt lime recovered its carbonic acid from the air , fixing the colors . Michelangelo saw that his belief that the pigments sank into the wet plaster was a mistake ; they remained on the surface , covered by a crystalline coating of carbonate of lime which fitted them the way the skin of a young athlete contains his flesh and blood . The entire panel now had a metallic luster which would protect the colors from heat , cold and moisture . But the amazing fact was that each day 's segment was drying slowly to the very colors Ghirlandaio had created in his studio . And yet , when he went alone to Santa Maria Novella the following Sunday during mass , weaving his way through the worshiping Florentines in their short velvet farsetti , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and high-crowned hats , he felt let down : so much of the freshness and vigor had leaked out from the drawings . The eight women were still lifes in mosaic , as if made of hard bits of colored stone . And certainly it was not the birth of John to the modest family of Elisabeth and Zacharias ; it was a social gathering in the home of a merchant prince of Italy , utterly devoid of religious spirit or content . Standing before the brilliant panel , the boy realized that Ghirlandaio loved Florence . The city was his religion . He was spending his life painting its people , its palaces , its exquisitely decorated rooms , its architecture and streets thronging with life , its religious and political pageants . And what an eye he had ! Nothing escaped him . Since no one would commission him to paint Florence he had made Florence Jerusalem ; the desert of Palestine was Tuscany , and all the biblical people modern Florentines . Because Florence was more pagan than Christian , everyone was pleased with Ghirlandaio 's sophisticated portraits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The forms were superb ; but where was the substance ? His eyes hazed over as he tried to formulate words to shape the thoughts pushing against each other inside his head . He too wanted to learn how to set down accurately what he saw . But what he felt about what he saw would always be more important .  | He drifted over to the Duomo , where young men gathered on the cool 11 marble steps to make laughter and view the passing pageant . Every day in Florence was a fair ; on Sundays this richest city in Italy , which had supplanted Venice in its trade with the Orient , was out to prove that its thirtythree banking palaces were providing wealth for all . The Florentine girls were blond , slender , they carried their heads high , wore colorful coverings on their hair and long-sleeved gowns , high-necked , with overlapping skirts pleated and full , their breasts outlined in filmier fabric and color . The older ail men were in somber cloaks , but the young men of the prominent families created the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing their calzoni with each leg dyed differently and patterned according to the family blazon . Their suite of attendants followed in identical dress . Jacopo was sitting on top of an old Roman sarcophagus , one of several that stood against the jagged tan brick face of the cathedral . From here he kept up a running comment about the passing girls while his scandalous eye sought out the ones to whom he awarded his highest accolade : " Ah , how mattressable . " Michelangelo went to Jacopo 's side , ran his hand caressingly over the sarcophagus , his fingers tracing out in its low relief the funeral procession of fighting men and horses . " Feel how these marble figures are still alive and breathing ! " his voice carried such exultation that his friends turned to stare at him . Now his secret had burst into the open of the Florentine dusk , with the sinking sun setting the domes of the Baptistery and cathedral on fire . His hunger had gotten the better of him . " God was the first sculptor ; He made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give His laws , what material did He use ? Stone . The Ten Commandments engraved on a stone tablet for Moses . What were the first tools that men carved for themselves ? Stone . Look at all us painters lolling on the Duomo steps . How many sculptors are there ? " His fellow apprentices were stunned by the outburst . Even Jacopo stopped searching for girls . They had never heard him speak with such urgency , his eyes glowing like amber coals in the fading light . He told them why he thought there were no more sculptors : the strength expended in carving with hammer and chisel exhausted mind and body alike , in contrast to the brushes , pens and charcoal which the painter used so lightly . Jacopo booted . Granacci answered his young friend . " If extreme fatigue is the criterion of art , then the quarryman taking the marble out of the mountain with his wedges and heavy levers has to he considered nobler than the sculptor , the blacksmith greater than the goldsmith and more important than the architect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michelangelo flushed . He had made a bad start . He studied the grinning faces of Jacopo , Tedesco and the two thirteen-year-olds . " But you have to agree that the work of art becomes noble in the degree to which it represents the truth ? Then sculpture will come closer to true form , for when you work the marble the figure emerges on all four sides .... " His words , usually so sparse , spilled over each other : the painter laid his paint on a flat surface and by use of perspective tried to persuade people that they were seeing the whole of a scene . But just try to walk around a person in a painting , or around a tree ! It was an illusion , a magician 's trick . Now the sculptor , ah ! he carved the full reality . That was why sculpture bore the same relationship to painting that truth did to falsehood . And if a painter blundered , what did he do ? He patched and repaired and covered over with another layer of paint . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form that it held . He could not glue back broken parts . That was why there were no more sculptors today , because it took a thousand times more accuracy of judgment and vision . He stopped abruptly , breathing hard . Jacopo jumped down from his perch on the lid of the sarcophagus , extended his two arms to indicate that he had taken over . He was bright ; he liked painting and understood it even though he was too lazy to work at it . " Sculpture is a bore . What can they make ? A man , a woman , a lion , a horse . Then all over again . Monotonous . But the painter can portray the whole universe : the sky , the sun , the moon and the stars , clouds and rain , mountains , trees , rivers , seas . The sculptors have all perished of boredom . " Sebastiano Mainardi joined the group and stood listening . He had taken his wife for her weekly walk , then returned to the Duomo steps and the company of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he enjoyed more than that of women . There were spots of color on his usually pale cheeks . " That 's true ! The sculptor needs only a strong arm and an empty mind . Yes , empty ; after a sculptor draws his simple design , what goes on inside his head during the hundreds of hours that he has to pound these chisels and points with a hammer ? Nothing ! But the painter has to think of a thousand things every moment , to relate all the integral parts of a painting . Creating the illusion of a third dimension is craftsmanship . That 's why a painter 's life is exciting , and a sculptor 's dull . " Tears of frustration welled in Michelangelo 's eyes . He cursed himself for his inability to carve out in words the stone forms that he felt in his innards . " Painting is perishable : a fire in the chapel , too much cold , and the paint begins to fade , crack . But stone is eternal ! Nothing can destroy it . When the Florentines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blocks ?  | Built them into new walls . And think of the Greek sculpture that is being dug up , two , three thousand years old . Show me a painting that 's two thousand years old . Look at this Roman marble sarcophagus ; as clear and strong as the day it was carved . .. " " And as cold ! " cried Tedesco . Mainardi raised his arm for attention . " Michelangelo , " he began gently , " has it ever occurred to you that the reason there are no sculptors left is because of the cost of material ? A sculptor needs a rich man or organization to give him a supply of marble and bronze . The Wool Guild of Florence financed Ghiberti for forty years to make the doors of the Baptistery . Cosiino de ' Medici supplied Donatello with the resources he needed . Who would provide you with the stone , who would support you while you practiced on it ? Paint is cheap , commissions are abundant ; that 's why we take on apprentices . And as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatal mistake , what about the painter working in fresco ? If the sculptor must sec the form inherent in the stone , must not the painter foresee the final result of his color in the fresh wet plaster and know precisely how it will turn out when dry ? " Michelangelo numbly had to agree that this was true . " Besides , " continued Mainardi , " everything that can ever be accomplished in sculpture has already been created by the Pisanos , by Ghiberti , Orcagna , Donatello . Take Desiderio da Settignano or Mino da Fiesole ; they made pretty , charming copies of Donatello . And Bertoldo , who helped Donatello cast his figures , and was there to learn the secrets that Donatello learned from Ghiberti : what has Bertoldo created except a few miniatures reduced from Donatello 's great concepts ? And now he 's sick and dying , his work done . No , the sculptor can do little more than copy , since the range of sculpture is so narrow . " Michelangelo turned away . If only he knew more ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures in space . Granacci touched the boy 's shoulder comfortingly . " Have you forgotten , Michelagnolo , what Praxiteles said ? Painting and sculpture have the same parents ; they are sister arts . ' " But Michelangelo refused to compromise . Without another word he walked down the cool marble steps , away from the Duomo , over the cobbled streets to home . 9 . The night was sleepless . IIe rolled and tossed . The room was hot , for I , odoyico said that air coming in a window was as bad as a crossbow shot . Buonarroto , who shared the bed , was placid in sleep as in all other things . Though two years younger than Michelangelo , he was the manager of the live boys .  | In the bed closer to the door , with the curtains drawn around it , slept the good and evil of the Buonarroti progeny : Lionardo , a year and a half older than Michelangelo , who spent his days yearning to be a saint ; and Giovansinrone , four years younger , lazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire to I , ucrezia 's kitchen because she had disciplined him . Sigismondo , the youngest , still slept in a trundle at the foot of Michelangelo 's bed . Michelangelo suspected that the boy would never be anything but a simpleton , since he lacked all capacity to learn . Quietly he sprang out of bed , slipped into his loincloth brache , short drawers , shirt and sandals , and left the house . He walked down the Via k il'Anguillara , the streets freshly washed and the stoops scrubbed , to Piazza Santa Croce , where the Franciscan church stood rough and dark in its unfinished brick . As he passed the open-sided gallery his eyes sought the outline of the Nino Pisano sarcophagus , held up by its four carved allegorical figures . He turned left on the Via del Fosso , built at the second limit of t he city walls , passed the prison , then the house belonging to the nephew of St. Catherine of Siena , and at the end of the street , at the corner of the Swallows , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Via i'ictrapiana , Street of the Flat Stones , which led through Piazza Sant'Amhrogio , in the church of which were buried the sculptors Verrocchio and yIiuo da Fiesole . From the piazza he followed the Borgo la Croce until it led to a country road called Via Pontassieve , at the end of which he came to the Affrico Itiv ( r , an affluent of the Arno , its green banks covered with trees and luxuriant vegetation . After crossing the Via Piagentina he reached Varlungo , a little cluster of houses at what had been a Roman ford , then turned once again to the left and made his way up the slope toward Settignano . I lc had been walking for an hour . Dawn flashed hot and bright . He paused the hillside to watch the mammal hills of Tuscany emerge from their 41.11 I , sleep . He cared little about the beauties of nature that so moved painters : the red poppies in the growing green wheat , the stands of almost hla k cypresses . No , he loved the valley of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the supreme carver : the lyrical hills , each range composed Ii a draftsman 's hand , complementing the succeeding ranges as they rolled Dark , with nothing the eye could see that was carelessly conceived . In the r Lo itv of its air distant peaks , rolling ridges , villas , trees though miles away , food out to be touched , their form tactile . Here nature 's perspective worked in reverse : the more distant the object , the nearer at hand it seemed . The Tuscan was a natural sculptor . When he took over the landscape hr built his stone terraces , planted his vineyards and olive orchards in harnrorly with the hills . No two haycocks were shaped the same ; each family tnhrritcd a sculptural form : circular , oblong , umbrella , tent , which stood at a sign for the farm . I IW ; I  | He climbed the cart road into the hills , closed in by the walls that are the buttress of the Tuscan 's life , giving him privacy and security and at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as thirteen feet high to hold the descending slopes , and built to last a hundred generations . Stone was the dominant factor : with it he built his farms and villas , enclosed his fields , terraced his slopes to retain his soil . Nature had been bountiful with stone ; every hill was an undeveloped quarry . If the Tuscan scratched deep with his fingernail he struck building materials sufficient for a city . And when he built of dry rock , his walls stood as though masoned . " The skill with which men handle stone tells how civilized they are . " ? He left the road where it turned off for the quarry at Maiano . For four years after his mother died he had been left to roam this countryside , though it was the proper age for him to he in school . There was no master at Settignano , and his father had been too withdrawn to care . Now he climbed through land of which he knew every jutting boulder and tree and furrow . His upward push brought him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gray stone church . This was the heart of the stonemason country , having bred the greatest scalpellini in the world , the generations that had built Florence . It was only two miles from the city , on the first rise above the valley floor , and an easy haul to town . It was said of Settignano that its surrounding hills had a stone heart and velvet breasts . As he walked through the tiny settlement toward the Buonarroti home he passed a dozen stoneyards scattered among the poderi or farms . Shortly , he came to the big yard that had produced Desiderio da Settignano . Death had caused him to drop his hammer and chisel at the age of thirty-six , but even by that time he was famous . Michelangelo knew well his marble tombs in Santa Croce and Santa Maria Novella , with their exquisite angels , and the Virgin carved so tenderly that she appeared asleep rather than dead . Desiderio had taken in Mino da Fiesole , who was just a young hewer of stones , and taught him the art of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome in grief over the loss of his master . Now there was no sculptor left in Florence . Ghiberti , who had trained Donatello and the Pollaiuolo brothers , had died some thirty-three years before . Donatello , who had died twenty-two years ago , had operated a studio d ( for half a century , but of his followers Antonio Rossellino had been dead nine years , Luca della Robbia six , Verrocchio had just died . The Pollaiuolo brothers had moved to Rome four years ago , and Bertoldo , Donatello 's favorite , Intl heir to his vast knowledge and workshop , was fatally ill . Andrea and C:iovanni Bella Robbia , trained by Luca , had abandoned stone sculpture for enameled trim cotta reliefs . Yes , s ( nll ) tnrc was dead . Unlike his father who wished he had been born  | a hundred years before , Michelangelo asked only that he could have been born forty years ago so that he could have been trained under Ghiberti ; or thirty years , so he could have been apprenticed to Donatello ; or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he could have been taught to work the marble by the Pollaiuolo brothers , by Verrocchio or Luca della Robbia . He had been born too late , into a country where for two hundred and fifty years , since Nicola Pisano had unearthed some Greek and Roman marbles and begun carving , there had been created in Florence and the valley of the Arno the greatest wealth of sculpture since Phidias completed his work on the Greek Parthenon . A mysterious plague which affected Tuscan sculptors had wiped out the very last of them ; the species , after having flourished so gloriously , was now extinct . Sick at heart , he moved on . io . Down the winding road a few hundred yards was the Buonarroti villa in the midst of a five-acre farm , leased to strangers on a long-term agreement . I lc had not been here for months . As always he was surprised by the beauty and spaciousness of the house , hewn two hundred years before of the best Maiano pietra serena , graceful in its austere lines , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a silversmith 's decoration . He could remember his mother moving in the rooms , weaving on the broad downstairs porch , kissing him good night in his big corner room overlooking the Buonarroti fields , the creek at the bottom , and the Topolino family of stonemasons on the opposite ridge . IIe crossed the back yard and the bone-textured stone walk past the stone cistern with its intricate hatching and crosshatching from which he had taken his first drawing lesson . He then scampered down the hill between the wheat on one side and the ripening grapes on the other , to the deep creek at the bottom , shaded by lush foliage . He slipped out of his shirt , short drawers and sandals and rolled over and over in the cool water , enjoying its wetness on his anxious tired body . Then he crouched in the hot sun for a few moments to dry , put on his clothes and climbed refreshed to the opposite ridge . IIc paused when he came in sight of the yard . This was the picture he loved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father working with tempered iron chisels to round a fluted column , the youngest son beveling a set of steps , one of the older two carving a delicate window frame , the other graining a door panel , the grandfather polishing a column on a  | pumice wheelstone with thin river sand . Behind them were three arches , and under them scurrying chickens , ducks , pigs . In the boy 's mind there was no difference between a scalpellino and a scultore , a stonecutter and a sculptor , for the scalpellini were fine craftsmen , bringing out the color and grain of the pietra serena . There might be a difference in the degree of artistry , but not in kind : every stone of the Pazzi , Pitti and Medici palaces was cut , beveled , given a textured surface as if it were a piece of sculpture : which to the Settignano scalpellino it was . Lesser craftsmen were confined to making routine blocks for smaller houses and paving stones for the streets . Yet so proud were all Florentines of their Iil simplest paving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being jostled in the cart that was taking him to the Palazzo della Signoria for hanging , cried out in protest : " What idiots were these , who cut such clumsy blocks ? " The father heard Michelangelo 's footsteps . " Buon di , Michelangelo . " h " Buon di , Topolino . " " Come va ? How goes it ? " " Non c'e male . Not bad . E te ? And you ? " " Non c'e male . The honorable Lodovico ? " " He goes well . " Topolino did not really care how things went with Lodovico : he had forbidden Michelangelo to come here . No one got up , for the stonemason rarely breaks his rhythm ; the two older boys and the one exactly Michelangelo 's age called out with welcoming warmth . " Ben venuto , Michelangelo . Welcome . " " Salve , good health , Bruno . Salve , Gilberto . Salve , Enrico . " The scalpellino 's words are few and simple , matching in length the single blow of the hammer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak at all : one , two , three , four , five , six , seven : no word from the lips , only the rhythm of the shoulder and the moving hand with the chisel . Then he speaks , in the period of pause : one , two , three , four . The sentence must fit the rest count of four or it remains unsaid or incomplete . If the thought must be involved it will be spaced between several work counts of seven , filling two or three counts of four . But the scalpellino has learned to confine his thinking to what can be expressed in the single four-count pause . There was no schooling for the stoneman . Topolino figured his contracts on his fingers . The sons were given a hammer and chisel at six , as Michelangelo had been , and by ten they were working full time on the stone . di There was no marriage outside the stone ring . Agreements with builders and architects were handed down from generation to generation , as were the quarrying jobs at Maiano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arches hung an oblong piece of pietra serena with examples of the classic treatments of the stone : herringbone , subbia punch-hole , rustic ,  | crosshatch , linear , bevel , centered right angle , receding step : the first alphabet Michelangelo had been given , and still the one he used more comfortably than the lettered alphabet with which he had been taught to read the Bible and Dante . Topolino spoke . " You 're apprenticed to Ghirlandaio ? " " Yes . " " You do not like it ? " " Not greatly . " " Peccato . Too bad . " " Who does somebody else 's trade makes soup in a basket , " said the old grandfather . " Why do you stay ? " It was the middle brother asking . " Where else is there to go ? " " We could use a cutter . " This was from Bruno . Michelangelo looked from the oldest son to the father . " Davvero ? It is true ? " " Davvero . " " You will take me as apprentice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You earn a share . " His heart leaped . Everyone chipped in silence while Michelangelo stood above the father who had just offered him a portion of the food that went into the family belly . " My father ... " " Ecco ! There you are ! " " Can I cut ? " The grandfather , turning his wheel , replied : " Every little bit helps , ' said the father who peed into the Arno because his son 's boat was beached at Pisa . " Michelangelo sat before a roughed-out column , a hammer in one hand , a chisel in the other . He liked the heft of them . Stone was concrete , not abstract . One could not argue it from every point of the compass , like love or theology . No theorist had ever separated stone from its quarry bed . He had a natural skill , unrested after the months of being away . Under his blows the pietra serena cut like cake . There was a natural rhythm between the inward and outward movement of his breath and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chisel across a cutting groove . The tactile contact with the stone made him feel that the world was right again , and the impact of the blows sent waves of strength up his skinny arms to his shoulders , torso , down through his diaphragm and legs into his feet . The pietra serena they were working was warm , an alive blue-gray , a reflector of changing lights , refreshing to look at . The stone had durability , vet it was manageable , resilient , as joyous in character as in color , bringing an Italian blue-sky serenity to all who worked it .  | stone , not in the arms or tools . The stone was master ; not the mason . If ever a mason came to think he was master , the stone would oppose and thwart him . And if a mason beat his stone as an ignorant contadino might beat his beasts , the rich warm glowing breathing material became dull , colorless , ugly ; died under his hand . To kicks and curses , to hurry and dislike , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It could be smashed by violence but never forced to fulfill . To sympathy , it yielded : grew even more luminous and sparkling , achieved fluid forms and symmetry . From the beginning he had been taught that stone had a mystic : it had to be covered at night because it would crack if the full moon got on it . Each block had areas inside where it was hollow and bent . In order for it to remain docile it had to be kept warm in sacks , and the sacks kept damp . Heat gave the stone the same undulations it had in its original mountain home . Ice was its enemy . " Stone will speak to you . Listen as you strike with the side of your hammer . " Stone was called after the most precious of foods : carne , meat . The scalpellini respected this stone . To them it was the most enduring I I : material in the world : it had not only built their homes , farms , churches , town , but for a thousand years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride of workmanship , a living . Stone was not king but god . They worshiped it as did their pagan Etruscan ancestors . They handled it with reverence . 1,1 Michelangelo knew them as men of pride : to care for their cattle , pigs , 1,1 vines , olives , wheat , this was ordinary work ; they did it well in order to eat well . But working the stone , all ! that was where a man lived . Had not the Settignanese quarried , shaped and built the most enchanting city in all Europe : Florence ? Jewel of the stonecarver 's art , its beauty created not by the architect and sculptor alone but by the scalpellino without whom there would have been no infinite variety of shape and decoration . Mon ; c Ma ri'licrjt a , a formless woman who worked the animals and fields : is well as the stove and tub , had come out of the house and stood under the ; itch , listening . She was the one about whom Lodovico had said bitterly , when lirlu  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Topolinos had taught him to work the stone with friendliness , to  | seek its natural forms , its mountains and valleys , even though it might seem solid ; never to grow angry or unsympathetic toward the material . " Stone works with you . It reveals itself . But you must strike it right . Stone does not resent the chisel . It is not being violated . Its nature is to change . Each stone has its own character . It must be understood . Handle it carefully , or it will shatter . Never let stone destroy itself . il ! I " Stone gives itself to skill and to love . " His first lesson had been that the power and the durability lay in the " A child sent out to nurse will take on the condition of the woman who feeds him . " She had suckled him with her own son for two years , and the day her breast ran dry she put both boys on wine . Water was for bathing before mass . Michelangelo felt for Monna Margherita much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affection and security . lle kissed her on both cheeks . " Buon giorno , figlio mio . " " Buon giorno , madre mia . " " Pazienza , " she counciled . " Ghirlandaio is a good master . Who has an art , has always a part . " The father had risen . " I must choose at Cave Maiano . Will you help load ? " " Willingly . A rivederci , nonno , grandfather . A rivederci , Bruno . Addio , Gilberto . Addio , Enrico . " " Addio , Michelangelo . " They rode side by side on the high seat behind the two beautiful-faced white oxen . In the fields the olive pickers were mounted on ladders made of slender tree stalks , notched to take the light crossbar branches . Baskets were tied around their waists with rope , flat against the stomach and crotch . They held the branches with their left hand , stripping down the little black olives with a milking movement of the right . Pickers are talkers ; two to a tree , they speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the contadino not to talk is to be dead a little . Topolino said under his breath : " Daws love another 's prattle . " The road , winding along the contour of the range , dipped into a valley and then slowly climbed Mount Ceceri to the quarry . As they rounded the bend of Maiano , Michelangelo saw the gorge in the mountain with its alternating blue and gray serena and iron-stained streaks . The pietra serena had been buried in horizontal layers . From this quarry Brunelleschi had chosen the stones for his exquisite churches of San Lorenzo and Santo Spirito . High on the cliff several men were outlining a block to be quarried with a scribbus , a point driven against the grain to loosen the hold from the main mass . He could see the point marks in successive layers through the stone formation , layers of stone peeled off as though stripped from a pile of parchment sheets . The level work area where the strata fell after they were loosed was shimmering with heat and dust from the cutting , splitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lean , sinewy men who worked the rock from dawn to dark without fatigue and who could cut as straight a line with hammer and chisel as a draftsman with pen and ruler : as concentrated in their hardness and durability as the rock itself . He had known these men since he was six and began riding behind the white oxen with Topolino . They greeted him , asked how things went : a primordial people , spending  | their lives with the simplest and most rudimentary force on earth : stone of the mountain , thrown up on the third day of Genesis . Topolino inspected the newly quarried stone with the running commentary Michelangelo knew so well : " That one has knots . Too much iron in this . Shale ; it 'll crumble into crystals like sugar on a bun . This one will be hollow . " Until finally , climbing over the rocks and making his way toward the cliff , he let out his breath sharply : " Ah ! Here is a beautiful piece of meat . " There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Michelangelo had been shown how to handle the density of the material without pulling his arms out of their sockets . He planted his legs wide , swung his weight from the hips ; Topolino opened the first crack between the stone and the ground with an iron bar . They moved the stone over the boulders to open ground , then with the help of the quarrymen the block was fulcrumed upward through the open tail of the cart . Michelangelo wiped the sweat from his face with his shirt . Rain clouds swept down the Arno from the mountains to the north . He bade Topolino good-by . " A domani , " replied Topolino , flicking the lines for the oxen to move off . Until tomorrow , Michelangelo thought , tomorrow being the next time I take my place with the family , be it a week or a year . He left the quarry , stood on the hill below Fiesole . Warm rain fell on his upturned face . The dark clumps of leaves on the olives were silver green . In the wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . Below him Florence looked as though someone were sprinkling it with gray powdered dust , blotting out the carpet of red tile roofs . Only the mammal dome of the cathedral stood out , and the straight proud upward thrust of the tower of the Signoria , complementary symbols under which Florence flourished and multiplied . He made his way down the mountain , feeling fifteen feet tall . 11 . Having taken a day off without permission , Michelangelo was at the studio early . Ghirlandaio had been there all night , drawing by candlelight . lie was unshaven , his blue beard and hollow cheeks in the flickering light giving him the appearance of an anchorite . Michelangelo went to the side of the platform on which the desk stood niaiestical ! v in command of its bottega , waited for Ghirlandaio to look up , then asked : " ! s something wrong ? , ( : hirlaudain rose , raised his hands wearily to breast height , then shook  | his fingers up and down loosely , as though trying to shed his troubles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the dozens of incomplete sketches of the Christ whom John was to baptize . The figures were slight to the point of delicacy . " I 'm intimidated because of the subject , " Ghirlandaio growled to himself . " I 've been afraid to use a recognizable Florentine . . . " He picked up a pen and flicked it swiftly over a sheet . What emerged was an irresolute figure , dwarfed by the bold John whom Ghirlandaio had already completed , and who was waiting , bowl of water in hand . He flung down the pen in disgust , muttered that he was going home for some sleep . Michelangelo went into the cool back yard and began sketching in the clear light that broke open Florence 's summer days . For a week he drew experimentally . Then he took a fresh paper and set down a figure with powerful shoulders , muscularly developed chest , broad hips , a full oval stomach , and a robust pair of thighs rooted firmly in big solid feet : a man who could split a block of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shocked when Michelangelo showed him his Christ . " You used a model ? " " The stonemason in Settignano who helped raise me . " " Christ a stonemason ! " " He was a carpenter . " " Florence wo n't accept a working-class Christ , Michelangelo . They 're used to having him genteel . " Michelangelo suppressed a tiny smile . " When I was first apprenticed you said , The true eternal painting is mosaic , ' and sent me up to San Miniato to see the Christ Baldovinetti restored from the tenth century . That Christ is no wool merchant from Prato . " " It 's a matter of crudity , not strength , " replied Ghirlandaio , " easy for the young to confuse . I will tell you a story . When Donatello was very young he once spent a lot of time making a wooden crucifix for Santa Croce , and when it was finished he took it to his friend Brunelleschi . It seems to me , ' said Brunelleschi , that you have put a plowman on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was most delicate in all its parts . ' Donatello , upset at the unexpected criticism from the older man , cried , If it were as easy to make this figure as to judge it . . . Try to make one yourself ! ' " That very day Brunelleschi set to work . Then he invited Donatello to dinner , but first the two friends bought some eggs and fresh cheese . When Donatello saw the crucifix in Brunelleschi 's hall he was so amazed that he threw up his arms in resignation , the eggs and the cheese that he had been holding in his apron falling to the floor . Brunelleschi said laughingly : " What are we to have for dinner , Donato , now that you have broken the eggs ? ' " Donatello , who could not take his eyes off the beautiful Christ , an-  | swered , It is your work to make Christs , and mine to make plowmen . " Michelangelo knew both crucifixes , the one of Brunelleschi being in Santa Maria Novella . Stumblingly he explained that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was so slight that it looked as though it had been created to be crucified . With Donatello 's figure the crucifixion had come as a horrifying surprise , even as it had to Mary and the others at the foot of the cross . He suggested that perhaps Christ 's spirituality did not depend on his bodily delicacy but rather on the indestructibility of his message . Abstract theology held no interest for Ghirlandaio . He turned back to his work , the automatic gesture of dismissal for an apprentice . Michelangelo went into the yard and sat in the baking sun with his chin resting on his chest . He had made a nuisance of himself . A few days later the studio was buzzing . Ghirlandaio had completed his Christ and was blowing it up to full size with color for the cartoon . When Michelangelo was permitted to see the finished figure he stood stunned : it was his Christ ! The legs twisted in an angular position , a little knock-kneed ; the chest , shoulders and arms those of a man who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protruding stomach that had absorbed its quantity of food : in its power and reality far outdistancing any of the still-life set figures that Ghirlandaio had as yet painted for the Tornabuoni choir . If Michelangelo expected Ghirlandaio to acknowledge him , he was disappointed . Ghirlandaio apparently had forgotten the discussion and the boy 's drawing . The following week the studio moved en masse to Santa Maria Novella to start the Death of the Virgin in the crescent-shaped lunette topping the left side of the choir . Granacci was pleased because Ghirlandaio had given him a number of the apostles to paint , and he climbed the scaffolding singing a tune about how passionately he loved his sweetheart , Florence , the object of all Florentines ' romantic ballads . Up the scaffold went Mainardi to do the figure kneeling to the left of the recumbent Mary , and David on the extreme right , doing his favorite subject , a Tuscan road winding up a mountainside to a white villa . Santa Maria Novella was empty at this early hour except for a few old women in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been taken down to let fresh air into the choir . Michelangelo stood irresolutely beneath the scaffolding , unnoticed , then began to walk the long center nave toward the bright sunlight . He turned to take a final look at the scaffolding rising tier upon tier in front of the stained-glass windows , ( lark now in the slight western light ; at the glowing colors of the sevcr , Il conipletcd panels ; the Ghirlandaio artists , tiny figures weaving across the lunette ; at the wooden stalls at the base of the choir covered with canvas , t he sacks of plaster ; Ind sand , the plank table of painting materials , all bathed in a soft glow .  | At the center of the church were a few wooden benches . He pulled one in place , took drawing paper and charcoal out of his shirt and began drawing the scene before him . Ile was surprised to see shadows climbing down the scaffolding . " It 's time for dinner , " announced Granacci . " Funny how painting spiritual subjects can give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today is Friday and you 'll have fish instead of bistecca . Go along with you , I 'm not hungry . " The empty church gave him the chance to draw the architecture of the choir . Long before he would have imagined it his comrades were climbing back up the scaffolding . The sun arched to the west and filled the choir with rich color . He felt someone staring holes through him from behind , turned to find Ghirlandaio standing there . Michelangelo remained silent . Ghirlandaio whispered hoarsely , " I ca n't believe that a boy of such tender years can have received such a gift . There are some things you know more about than I do , and I have been working for over thirty years ! Come to the studio early tomorrow . Perhaps we can make things more interesting for you from now on . " Michelangelo walked home , his face suffused with ecstasy . Granacci teased : " You look like a beatified Fra Angelico saint floating above the paving stones . " Michelangelo looked at his friend mischievously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a saint , not with your crusty disposition . But all honest effort to re-create that which God created originally ... " ... is a form of worship ? " " Has in it a love of God 's universe . Else why would the artist bother ? " " I have always loved God , " replied Michelangelo simply . The next morning he waited impatiently for the first gray ash to sift into the narrow strip of sky over the Via dei Bentaccordi . In the Via Larga the country people were dozing in their carts as the donkeys and oxen clopclopped over the stones with their produce for the Old Market . He saw Giotto 's Campanile standing pink and white in the first streaked dawn . Even in his eager rush through the streets he had time to marvel at the dome which Brunelleschi had had the genius to build after the vast space had stood open to the skies and the elements for more than a hundred years , because no one knew how to close it without the use of traverse beams . Ghirlandaio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the greatest of all bores . Draw up a stool . " The boy sat before Ghirlandaio , who pulled aside the curtain behind him so that the north light fell on them . " Turn your head . A little more . I 'm going to sketch you as young John  | leaving the city to go to the desert . I had n't found a satisfactory model until I saw you working in Santa Maria Novella yesterday .... " Michelangelo swallowed hard . After his sleepless night 's dream of originating whole cartoons with which to fill the still empty panels ... ! Ghirlandaio had not meant to deceive his apprentice . He summoned Michelangelo , showed him the over-all plan for the Death of the Virgin , added casually : " I want you to collaborate with Granacci in this scene of the apostles . Then we 'll let you try your hand at the figures on the left , together with the little angel beside them . " Granacci had not a jealous bone in him . Together they sketched the apostles , the one bald-headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning after mass , " said Granacci , " let 's come back to the studio and I 'll start you at bedrock . " Granacci had been speaking literally : he put Michelangelo to work on the rock wall at the back of the studio yard . " Your wall has to be sound ; if it crumbles your fresco goes with it . Check for saltpeter ; the slightest patch and your paint will be eaten up . Avoid the sand that has been taken from too near the sea . Your lime should be old . I 'll show you how to use a trowel to get a full smooth surface . Remember , plaster has to be beaten with the least possible amount of water , to the consistency of butter . " Michelangelo did as he had been instructed , but complained : " Granacci , I want to draw with a pen , not a trowel ! " Granacci replied sharply : " An artist has to be master of the grubbiest detail of his craft . If you do n't know how to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a perfect surface ? " " You 're right . I 'll beat it some more . " When the mixture was right Granacci handed Michelangelo a square board to be held in one hand , and a flexible five-inch trowel with which to apply the plaster . Michelangelo soon had the feel of it . When the plaster had dried sufficiently Granacci held an old studio cartoon against the wall while Michelangelo used the ivory pointing stick to outline several figures , then with Granacci still holding took up the little bag of charcoal to fill the holes , Granacci removed the cartoon , the boy drew a connecting outline with red ochre and , when this had dried , dusted off the charcoal with a feather . Mainardi came into the studio , saw what was going on and forcibly turned Michelangelo to him . " You must remember that fresh plaster changes its consistency . In the  | morning you have to keep your colors liquid so that you do n't choke up its pores . Toward sundown they have to be kept liquid because the plaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the day . But before you can apply colors you have to learn how to grind them . You know there are only seven natural colors . Let 's start with black . " The colors came from the apothecary in walnut-sized pieces of pigment . A piece of porphyry stone was used as a base , a porphyry pestle to grind with . ' I'hough the minimum grinding time was a half hour , no paint was allowed on a Ghirlandaio panel that had been ground hard for less than two hours . " My father was right , " commented Michelangelo , his hands and arms blackened with the pigment : " to be an artist is first to be a manual laborer . " Ghirlandaio had entered the studio . " Hold on there , " he exclaimed . " Michelangelo , if you want a real mineral black , use this black chalk ; if you want a slag black you 'll need to mix in a little mineral green , about this much on your knife . " Warming to the situation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors you have to mix two parts of the finest sinopia with one part white well-slaked lime . Let me show you t he proportions . " David appeared in the open door , one hand clutching a sheaf of bills , ender his other arm an account book . " What 's the good of teaching him about colors , " he exclaimed , " if he does n't know how to make his own brushes ? Good ones are not always available . Look here , Michelangelo , these hog bristles are taken from white pigs ; but be sure they 're domestic . Use a pound of bristles to a brush . Bind them to a large stick like this ... " Michelangelo threw his stained arms ceilingward in mock despair . " I Iclp ! You 're crowding my whole three years of apprenticeship into one Sunday morning ! " When Granacci 's fresco was ready Michelangelo went up onto the scaffold to serve as his assistant . Ghirlandaio had not yet given him permission to handle a brush , but he worked for a week applying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the time he completed his own drawings for the Death of the Virgin and was ready to create his first fresco . The early October air was crisp and lucid . The crops were in , the wine pressed , the olive oil secure in hig jars ; the contadini were cutting back the trees and hauling home the branches for winter warmth , the fields were lying fallow as the foliage tinned a russet brown to match the warm tan stones of the crenelated SiE ; noria tower . The two friends climbed the scaffolding loaded with buckets of plaster , w.itcr , brushes , mixing spoons , the cartoon and colored sketches . Michelangelo laid a modest area of intonaco , then held the cartoon of the white  - -  baited and bearded near saint with the enormous eyes . He used the ivory  | stick , the charcoal bag , the red ochre connecting line , the feather duster . Then he mixed his paints for the verdaccio , which he applied with a soft brush to get a thin base . He picked up a finely pointed brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful Roman nose , the deep-set eyes , the shoulder-long waving white hair and mustache flowing gracefully into the full-face beard . Freehand , glancing only once at his sketch , he put in the old man 's neck , shoulder and arm . Now ready to apply paint in earnest , he turned to Granacci with big eyes . " I ca n't be of any more help to you , Michelagnolo mio , " responded Granacci ; " the rest is between you and God . Buona Fortuna . Good luck . " With which he scrambled down the scaffolding . Michelangelo found himself alone at the top of the choir , alone on his perch above the church and the world . For a moment he suffered vertigo . How different the church looked from up here ; so vastly hollow and empty . In his nostrils was the dampness of the fresh plaster and the pungence of paint . His hand clamped the brush . He squeezed it between the fingers and thumb of his left hand , remembered that in the early morning he would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verde and began to shade all those parts of the face that would be darkest : under the chin , the nose , 1the lips , the corners of the mouth and the eyebrows . Only once did he go to the master of the studio for help . " How do I mix the exact shade I had yesterday ? " " By the weight on your knife of the amount you cut off the pigment cake . The hand can judge more accurately than the eye . " For a week he worked alone . The studio stood by to assist if called , but no one intruded . This was his baptism . By the third day everyone knew he was not following the rules . He was drawing anatomical nude bodies of male figures , using for models two men he had sketched unloading in the Old Market , then draping them with robes , the reverse of the practice of suggesting a man 's bones by the folds of a cloak . Ghirlandaio made no effort to stop or correct him , contenting himself with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way God made Adam . " Michelangelo had never seen an angel , and so he did not know how to draw one . Even more perplexing was what to do about the wings , for no one could tell him whether they were made of flesh or some diaphanous material out of the Wool or Silk Guild . Nor could anyone give him any info ' ntation about- the halo : was it solid , like a metal , or atmospheric like a r ; iinl ) onV ' The youngsters ragged him mercilessly . Ilj " You 're a fake , " cried Cieco . " Those are no wings at all . " " Anil a timid , " added 13aldinclli . " They fade into the robe so no one can sec litchi. "  | " That halo could be taken for an accidental marking on the wall , " contributed Tedesco . " What 's the matter , are n't you a Christian ? " " Have n't you any faith ? " Michelangelo grinned in sickly fashion . " My angel is the carpenter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carve a pair of wings for him ... " His two figures were a distinct picture by themselves , located in the bottom corner of the lunette under a cone-shaped mountain crowned by a castle . The rest of the lunette was crowded with more than twenty figures surrounding the Virgin 's high-pillowed bier , the saints ' and apostles ' apocryphal faces set at slightly different angles of anguish . It was even difficult to find Mary . When Michelangelo came down from the scaffold the last time , Jacopo passed David 's little black hat and everybody contributed a few scudi to buy wine . Jacopo raised the first toast : " To our new comrade . . . who will soon be apprenticed to Rosselli . " Michelangelo was hurt . " Why do you say that ? " " Because you 've stolen the lunette . " Michelangelo never had liked wine , but this cup of Chianti seemed particularly galling . " Shut up with you now , Jacopo . I want no trouble . " I , ate that afternoon Ghirlandaio called him aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresco , either of praise or criticism ; it was as though he had never mounted the scaffold at all . He looked up from his desk , his r ' es dark . " ' They are saying I am jealous . It is true . Oh , not of those two figures , t hry 're immature and crude . If they stand out , it 's not because they are bettr. : drawn but because they do n't fit into our studio style . My six-year-old l ( idolfo comes closer to copying the bottega method than you do . But let thrrc be no mistake , I am jealous of what will ultimately be your ability to d ur w. , , r11ichelangelo suffered a rare moment of humility . Now what am I going to do with you ? Release you to Rosselli ? Asourcdly not ! There is plenty of work ahead in these remaining panels . PreIsur the cartoon for the figures of the assistants on the right . And try not to make them stand out like bandaged toes . " Michelangelo returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ( landaio 's drawings out of the desk and put back the originals . The next ' twining Ghirlandaio murmured as Michelangelo went by : " ' Thank you for returning my drawings . I hope they have been helpful . "  | The valley of the Arno had the worst winter weather in Italy . The skies overhead were leaden , the cold had a creeping quality that permeated stone and wool and bit at the flesh within . After the cold came the rain and the cobbled streets were running rivers . Anything not cobbled was a bog of mud . The only bright spot was the arrival of Isabella d'Aragona on her way north to marry the Duke of Milan , with her large train of ladies and gentlemen sumptuously gowned by her father , the Duke of Calabria . Ghirlandaio 's studio had but one fireplace . Here the men sat at a semicircular table facing the flames , crowded together for warmth , their backs cold but their fingers getting enough heat to enable them to work . Santa Maria Novella was even worse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drafts that blew through the church rattled the planks and leather thongs of the scaffolding . It was like trying to paint in a high wind , with one 's nostrils breathing ice water . But if the winter was intense , it was brief . By March the tramontana had stopped blowing , the sun 's rays had a little warmth in them again , and the skies were powdered with a touch of blue . On the second of these days Granacci burst into the studio , his usually placid eyes blinking hard . Michelangelo had rarely seen his friend so keyed up . " Come with me . I have something to show you . " Granacci secured David 's permission and in a moment the two boys were in the street . Granacci guided Michelangelo across town toward the Piazza San Marco . They paused a moment as a procession passed carrying relics of San Girolamo , a jaw and an armbone richly bound in silver and gold , from the altar of Santa Maria del Fiore . On the Via Larga , opposite one side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in here . " He pushed the gate open . Michelangelo entered , stood confounded . It was an enormous oblong garden , with a small building , or casino , in the center ; in front , and directly at the end of a straight path , was a pool , a fountain , and on a pedestal a marble statue of a boy removing a thorn from his foot . On the wide porch of the casino a group of young men were working at tables . All four walls of the garden were open loggias displaying antique marble busts : of the Emperor Hadrian , of Scipio , the Emperor Augustus , Agrippina , Nero 's mother , and numerous sleeping cupids . There was a straight path leading to the casino , lined with cypresses . Coming from each corner of the quadrangle and centering on the casino were other tree-lined paths curving tlnnough green lawns as big as meadows . Michelangelo could not take his eyes from the loggia of the casino where  | two young men were working over a piece of stone , measuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chisels . Ile turned to Granacci , stuttered : " Who . . . what . . . is this ? " " A sculpture garden . " " But ... what for ? " " A school . " " . . . school ? " " To train sculptors . " His knees sagged . " What sculptors . . . ? " " This garden belonged to Clarice de ' Medici . Lorenzo bought it for her , to be her home in case of his death . Clarice died last July , and Lorenzo has started a school for sculptors . He has brought in Bertoldo to teach . " " But Bertoldo is dead ! " " No , he was only dying . Lorenzo had him carried here on a litter from Santo Spirito hospital , showed him the garden , and told Bertoldo he must restore Florence to its days of greatness in sculpture . Bertoldo got dff the litter and promised Lorenzo that the era of Ghiberti and Donatello would he re-created . " Michelangelo 's eyes devoured the garden , moving around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vases , the bust of Plato beside the gate . " That 's Bertoldo now on the porch , " said Granacci . " I met him once . Shall I present you ? " Michelangelo shook his head up and down savagely . They walked down the gravel path , circled the pool and fountain . Half a dozen men from fifteen to thirty years old were working at board tables . 11crtoldo , a figure so slight as to seem all spirit and no body , had his long white hair wrapped in a turban . His red cheeks glowed as he instructed two boys in roughing a piece of marble . " Maestro Bertoldo , may I present my friend Michelangelo . " Bertoldo looked up . He had light blue eyes and a soft voice that strangely carried over the blows of the hammer . He looked at Michelangelo . " Who is your father ? " " Lodovico di Lionardo Buonarroti-Simoni. " " 1 have heard the name . Do you work stone ? " Michelangelo 's brain stood numb . Someone called to Bertoldo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loggia . Granacci took Michelangelo 's hand and led him through the rooms of the casino , one displaying Lorenzo 's collection of cameos , coins and medals , another examples from all the artists who had worked for the Medici family : Ghiberti , who won Lorenzo dc ' Medici 's great-grandfather 's contest for the Baptistery doors ; Donatello , who was Cosimo de ' Medici 's protege ; Benozzo Gozzoli ,  | who had frescoed the chapel in their palace with portraits of the Medici in his Journey of the Wise men to Bethlehem . Here were Brunelleschi 's models for the Duomo , Fra Angelico 's drawings of saints for San Marco , Masaccio 's sketches for the church of the Carmine , a trove that staggered the boy . Granacci again took him by the hand , led him down the path to the gate and out into the Via Larga . Michelangelo sat on a bench in the Piazza San Marco with pigeons thronging about his feet and the heel of his palm pressing his forehead bruisingly . When he looked up at Granacci @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How did they get in ? " " Lorenzo and Bertoldo chose them . " Michelangelo groaned . " And I have more than two years left at Ghirlandaio 's . Mamma mia , I have destroyed myself ! " " Pazienza ! " consoled Granacci . " You are not an old man yet . When you 've completed your apprenticeship ... " " Patience ! " exploded Michelangelo . " Granacci , I 've got to get in ! Now ! I do n't want to be a painter , want to be a marble carver . Now ! How can I get admitted ? " " You have to be invited . " " How do I get invited ? " " I do n't know . " " Then who does ? Someone must ! " " Stop pushing . You 'll shove me clear off this bench . " Michelangelo quieted . Tears of frustration came to his eyes . " Oh , Granacci , have you ever wanted anything so hard you could n't bear it ? " ... no . Everything has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Granacci gazed at the naked longing on his friend 's face . " Perhaps . "  | HE WAS drawn to the garden on the Piazza San Marco as though the ancient stone statues had magnets buried within them . Sometimes he did not know that his feet were carrying him there . He would find himself inside the gate , lurking in the shadow of the loggia . He did not speak to anyone , did not venture down the path through the meadow to the casino where Bertoldo and the apprentices were working . He just stood motionless , a hunger in his eyes . Thrashing deep into the night , as his brothers lay sleeping around him , he thought , " There must be some way . Lorenzo de ' Medici 's sister Nannina is married to Bernardo Rucellai . If I went to him , told him I was Francesca 's son , asked him to speak to Il Magnifico for me ... " But a Buonarroti could not go to a Rucellai , hat in hand . Ghirlandaio was patient . " We must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull our scaffolding down to the lower panel , Zacharias Writing the Name of His Son . Time is growing short now . Suppose you start drawing instead of running the streets ? " " May I bring in a model for the neophyte ? I saw one in the Old Market , unloading his cart . " " Agreed . " The boy sketched his roughhewn young contadino just in from the fields , naked except for his brache , kneeling to take off his clodhoppers ; the flesh tones a sunburned amber , the figure clumsy , with graceless bumpkin muscles ; but the face transfused with light as the young lad gazed up at John . Behind him he did two white-bearded assistants to John , with beauty in heir faces and a rugged power in their figures . Granacci hovered over him uneasily as the figures emerged . " Ghirlandaio is incapable of drawing such figures . " " Bandaged toes , eh ? " ( ; hirlandaio was too swamped in designing the remaining half dozen panels to interfere . This time when Michelangelo mounted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He experimented with flesh tones from his paint pots , enjoyed this culminating physical effort of bring-  | ing his figures to life , clothing them in warm-colored lemon-yellow and rose robes . Yet always at the back of his mind he was crying : " Two whole years ? How will I endure it ? " Ghirlandaio was working him hard . " We 'll move you over to the other side of the choir now for the Adoration of the Magi . Prepare the cartoon for the last two standing figures here on the right . " The Adoration cartoon was already so crowded with figures that be derived little pleasure from adding two more . Returning from dinner , Granacci announced to the apprentices ' table : " It 's just a year ago today that Michelangelo started . I 've ordered a damigiana of wine brought in at sundown ; we 'll have a celebration . " Silence greeted him ; the studio was crackling with tension . At the center table the apprentices had their heads down over their work . Ghirlandaio was sitting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mosaics , his scowl blacker than the base of his beard . " It Magnifico has summoned me and asked if I would like to send my two best apprentices to his new Medici school , " he declared . Michelangelo stood riveted to the planks of the studio floor . " No , I would not like to send my two best apprentices , " cried Ghirlandaio . " To have my bottega raided . And certainly not on the day that Benedetto is invited to Paris to paint for the King of France . I have half a dozen panels to complete ! " He glared down at the assemblage . " But who dares say No ' to Il Magni fico ? You , Buonarroti . You would like to go ? " " I have been hanging around that garden like a starved dog in front of a butcher stall , " pleaded Michelangelo . " Basta ! Enough ! " It was the angriest Michelangelo had ever seen him . " Granacci , you and Buonarroti are released from your apprenticeship . I 'll sign the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , all of you ! 1 ) o you think I am Ghirlandaio Il Magnifaco , with millions to support an academy ? " Joy drenched Michelangelo to the skin like a tramontana rain . Granacci stood glum . " Granacci , taro mio , what is it ? " " I like paint . I ca n't work with stone . It 's too hard . " " No , no , my friend , you will be a fine sculptor . I will help you . Just wait and sec. " ( ; ranacci achieved a wistful smile . " Oh . I will conic with you , Michelangelo . But whatever will I do with a li ; inioucr and cltiscl ? I 'll cut myself off at the knees ! " Michelangelo could not concentrate . After a little time he left the big table tin ! went I o ( : Itirl ; ntdaio 's desk . IIc wanted to thank the man who only a year ; ago haul taken him in ; hut he stood below the desk , stars in his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ express gratitude to a man for letting you abandon him ? Ghirlandaio saw the conflict on the boy 's face . When he spoke , it was softly , so no one else might hear . " You were right , Buonarroti : fresco is not your trade . That neophyte you did for me looks as though it were carved out of rock . You have talent as a draftsman ; with years of training perhaps you can transfer it to stone . But never forget that Domenico Ghirlandaio was your first master . " In front of the Buonarroti house that evening Michelangelo muttered to Granacci : " You 'd better come in with me . With two of us in the same sack he 's not so likely to drop it off the Ponte Vecchio . " They climbed the main stairway to avoid the kitchen and Michelangelo 's stepmother , went quietly into the family room where his father sat hunched over the angular corner desk , dwarfed by the fourteen-foot ceiling . The room was cold ; it took the Florentine sun the better part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is news . I am leaving Ghirlandaio 's . " " Ah , splendid ! I knew you would come to your senses . You will join the Wool Guild ... " " I 'm leaving to become a student at the Medici sculpture garden . " Lodovico was caught between joy and befuddlement . " . .. Medici garden . . . what garden ? " " I 'm going too , Messer Buonarroti , " added Granacci ; " we are to be apprenticed to Bertoldo , under the guidance of Il Magnifico . " " A stonecutter ! " Lodovico threw anguished arms ceilingward . " To be a sculptor , Father . Bertoldo is the last master left . " " One never knows the end of a piece of bad luck : it has more turns than a snake . If your mother had n't been thrown from her horse you would not have been sent to the Topolinos to nurse ; you would have known nothing of stonecutting . " Michelangelo did not risk an answer . Granacci spoke . " Messer Buonarroti , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and never got stone dust in their lungs . Your son has an affinity for sculpture . " " What is a sculptor ? Lower than a painter . Not even a member of the Twelve Guilds . A laborer , like a woodchopper . Or an olive picker . " " With one big difference , " Granacci persisted courteously ; " the olives are hu  --  sscd for oil , the wood is burned cooking soup . Both are consumed . Art has a magic quality : the more minds that digest it , the longer it lives . " " Poetry ! " screamed Lodovico . " I 'm talking hard common sense to save Ike life of my family , and you recite poetry . " Molina Alessandra , his grandmother , had come into the room . " ' Tell your father what Lorenzo , II Magnifico , is offering , Michelagnolo.  | He is the richest man in Italy , and known to be generous . How long is the apprenticeship ? How large the wage ? " " I do n't know . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " sneered Lodovico . " Do you think we have the wealth of the Granacci , that we can support you in your follies ? " A flush mottled Francesco Granacci 's blond cheeks . He spoke with unaccustomed bluntness . " I asked . Nothing is promised . No contract . No pay . Just free instruction . " Michelangelo shifted his legs and torso to receive Lodovico 's culminating burst of rage . Instead Lodovico collapsed onto a hard leather chair with a heavy plop , tears coming to his eyes . Detachedly Michelangelo thought : " It 's funny about us Florentines : not one drop of our blood is salted with sentiment , yet we cry so easily . " He went to his father 's side , put a hand on his shoulder . " Father , give me a chance . Lorenzo de ' Medici wants to create a new generation of sculptors for Florence . I want to become one of it them . " Lodovico looked up at his most promising son . " Lorenzo has asked specifically for you ? Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much easier it would be for everyone if he could tell a few simple lies . " Lorenzo asked Ghirlandaio for his two best apprentices . Granacci and I were chosen . " His stepmother had been listening at the kitchen door . She came into the room . Her face was pale , the dark side hairs standing out in stark relief . To Michelangelo she said : " I have nothing against you , Michelangelo . You are a good boy . You eat well . " She turned to Lodovico . " But I must speak for my people . My father thought it would be an honor for us to be connected with the Buonarroti . What do I have left if you let this boy destroy our position ? " Lodovico gripped the sides of his chair . He looked weary . " I will never give my consent . " Then he walked out of the room , taking his wife and mother with him . In the lacerated silence Granacci said : " IIc 's only trying to do his duty by you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's judgment is better than his ? It 's asking too much . " " Should I lose my opportunity ? " flared Michelangelo angrily . " No . But rcincnibcr he 's doing the best he can , with a bullheaded son forking bins into a situation which he has not , forgive me , the intellect to nnc ! crst ; nul . " Mii'bii ; ngclo blinked in silence . " You love your Either , do n't you , Granacci ? " " I envy you . "  | " Then you should be kind to your father . " " Kind ? " " Yes , since you have no intention of being hurt by him . " The Medici sculpture garden was unlike Ghirlandaio 's bottega ; it did not have to earn its living . Domenico Ghirlandaio was always rushed , not only to earn money for a large family but because he signed so many contracts with completion dates . Nothing could be further from pressure than the atmosphere into which Michelangelo stepped on the warm April day when he began his apprenticeship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garden was : " Take your time . Do n't make haste . We have only one mission here : to learn . We have nothing to sell but training , nothing to push to completion but your own skill and artistry . You have only to grow . Calma ! Prepare yourself for a lifetime of sculpturing . " The first person to greet him was Pietro Torrigiani , a powerfully built blond green-eyed beauty . He said with a flashing white-toothed smile : " So you 're the lurker . The Ghost of the Garden . You haunted these porticoes . " " I did n't think you noticed me . " " Noticed ! " replied Torrigiani . " We were devoured by your eyes . " Bertoldo loved only two things as well as sculpture : laughter and cooking . his humor had in it more spice than his chicken alla cacciatora . He had written a cookbook , and his one complaint at having moved into the Medici palace was that he had no chance to celebrate his recipes . But sculpture he could and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , red-checked face and pale blue eyes was the inheritor of all the communicable knowledge of the Golden Age of Tuscan sculpture . He linked his thin arms through those of the new apprentices . " True , not all skill is communicable , " he explained . " Donatello made me his heir , but he could never make me his peer . He poured his experience and craftsmanship into me the way molten bronze is poured into a cast . No man can do more . Without Donato , I would have been a maker of gold jewelry ; after more than half a century with him , I remained only a miniaturist . Try as he would he could n't put his finger on my fist , nor his passion in my bowels . We all are as God made us . I will show you everything Ghiberti taught Donatello , and Donatello taught me ; how much you absorb depends on your capacity . A teacher is like a cook ; give him a stringy chicken or a tough piece of veal , and not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Michelangelo laughed out loud . Bertoldo , pleased with his own humor , turned them toward the casino . " And now to work . If you have any talent , it will come out . " Michelangelo thought , " Just let them put a hammer and subbia in my hands and they will see the chips fly ! " Bertoldo had no intention of putting these tools into the hands of a beginner . He assigned Michelangelo a drawing desk on the portico between seventeen-year-old Torrigiani and twenty-nine-year-old Andrea Sansovino , who had been apprenticed to Antonio Pollaiuolo and whose commissioned work was to be seen in Santo Spirito . Supplying him with materials from the inner rooms , Bertoldo said : " Drawing is a different medium for the sculptor . A man and a block of stone arc three-dimensional , which immediately gives them more in common than a man and a wall or a panel of wood to be painted . " Michelangelo found the apprentices in the garden akin to those at Ghirlandaio 's . Sansovino was the counterpart of Mainardi : already a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terra cotta ; with Mainardi 's sweet disposition , giving generously of his time and patience to the beginners . At the other end of the scale was Soggi , a fourteen-year-old like Cieco , who had stumbled into sculpture and to Michelangelo 's rigorous eye was totally without talent . And there was the inevitable Jacopo , in this case twenty-year-old Baccio da Montelupo , as thoughtless as a wren and , like Jacopo , an amoral , carnal Tuscan who scavenged each night 's scandal for the morning 's tall tale . On Michelangelo 's first morning of work Baccio burst in late with the day 's most exciting news : a monster had been born in Venice , with one eye behind each ear ; in neighboring Padua another monster had been born with two heads , and two hands for each arm . The next morning he told of the Florentine who consorted with bad females " so as to save as much as possible his wife 's virtue . " I-ie was particularly good with contadini humor ; he told of the patrician Florentine lady , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasant coming out of Santo Spirito : " Is the mass for the villani , ill bred , over ? " " Yes , madam , " replied the peasant , " and the mass for the puttane , whores , is about to begin , so hurry ! " Bertoldo clapped his hands in delight . The counterpart of Granacci was Rustici , fifteen-year-old son of a wealthy ' l'usc:un nobleman , who worked for his own pleasure and the honor of creating art . Lorenzo had wanted Rustici to live in the Medici palace , but the young ; man preferred to stay by himself in rooms in the Via de ' Martelli . Michelangelo had been at the garden only a week when Rustici invited him to ( ginner . " I , ike Bertoldo , I enjoy the homely details of cooking . I 'll put a goose in the oven to bake in the morning . "  | Michelangelo found Rustici , rustic , living up to his name , for the ment was filled with animals : three dogs , an eagle chained to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's estate who kept screeching : " Va ' all ' inferno ! Go to hell ! " Even more distracting was the porcupine Rustici had trained to be a pet , who moved restlessly under the dinner table pricking Michelangelo 's legs with his quills . After dinner they entered a quiet room with family paintings on the walls . Against this aristocratic background , the rustic became the cultured young man . " You can draw , Michelangelo . From this perhaps you will evolve into a sculptor . Then let me warn you : do not go to live in the luxuriousness of the palace . " Michelangelo gave a repudiatory snort . " Little danger of that . " " Listen , my friend : it 's pleasant to get used to the expensive , the soft , the comfortable . Once you 're addicted , it 's so easy to become a sycophant , to trim the sails of your judgment in order to be kept on . The next step is to change your work to please those in power , and that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rustici . " The apprentice to whom he became closest was Torrigiani , who looked to Michelangelo more like a soldier than a sculptor . Torrigiani fascinated Michelangelo ; he also terrified him when he knitted his brows and spoke in his deeply resonant voice . Torrigiani came from an ancient family of wine merchants , long since noble , and was the most audacious of the apprentices in handling Bertoldo . He could also be quarrelsome , having alienated sevcral of his fellow apprentices . He gave Michelangelo a quick , warm friendtalking to him constantly from the adjoining worktable . Michelangelo had never known anyone as handsome as Torrigiani ; this kind of physical l rauty , almost of human perfection , left him weak in the face of his own lack of fine features and smallness of stature . Granacci watched the relationship with Torrigiani grow . To Michelant:clo 's question whether Granacci did not think Torrigiani magnificent , t:c:niacci replied guardedly : " 1 have known him all my life . Our families are associated . " " You have n't answered my question , Granacci @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peck of salt with him . " 1 lc had been in the garden for a week when Lorenzo de ' Medici entered wit h a young girl . Michelangelo now saw close up for the first time the man who , without office or rank , ruled Florence and had made her a mighty tcpnblic , wealthy not only in trade but in art , literature , scholarship . Lotrnz.o dc ' Medici , forty years old , had a roughhewn face that appeared to have been carved out of dark mountain rock ; it was an irregular countenance , nut at all handsome , with muddy skin , a jutting jaw , lower lip which pro'Hided beyond the upper , a turned-up nose , the up-tilting end of which  | bulked larger than the bony bridge ; large dark eyes , cheeks showing dark hollows beyond the corners of the mouth ; and a mass of dark hair parted in the center , then combed down to the middle of each eyebrow . He was dressed in a long sienna-colored robe , with purple sleeves , the tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just over medium height , with a sturdy physique which he kept in condition by days of hard riding , and hawking . He was also a trained classical student , an omnivorous reader of Greek and Latin manuscripts , a poet whom the Plato Academy likened to Petrarch and Dante , the builder of Europe 's first public library for which he had assembled ten thousand manuscripts and books , the largest collection since Alexandria . He was acknowledged to be " the greatest patron of literature and art that any prince has ever been , " with a collection of sculptures , paintings , drawings , carved gems , open to all artists and students for study and inspiration . For the scholars who had gathered in Florence to make it the scholastic heart of Europe , he had provided villas on the slope of Fiesole , where Pico della Mirandola , Angelo Poliziano , Marsilio Ficino and Cristoforo Landino translated newly found Greek and Hebraic manuscripts , wrote poetry , philosophic and religious books , helped create what Lorenzo called " the revolution of humanism . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite topic of conversation in Florence : of how he had weak eyes , and had been born without a sense of smell . Now , as he listened to Lorenzo speaking to Bertoldo , he realized that the voice had a harsh , unpleasing quality . Yet this would appear to be Lorenzo 's only unpleasing quality , just as the weakness of his eyes was his only weakness , and the lack of a sense of smell the only lack with which he had been born . For Lorenzo , single richest man in the world , courted by rulers of the Italian city-states , as well as dynasties as powerful as Turkey and China , had an open , lovable nature and a total lack of arrogance . Ruler of the Republic , in the same sense that the gonfalonieri di giustizia and the Signoria were governors of the law and ordinance of the city , he had no army , no guard , walked the streets of Florence unattended , speaking to all citizens as true equals , living a simple family life , romping on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists , literary men and scholars of the world . Therein lay his genius . He exercised absolute authority in matters of policy , yet governed Florence with such good judgment and inherent courtesy and dignity that people who might otherwise be enemies worked together harmoniously . Not even his able father , Piero , or his genius grandfather , Cosimo , called Pater Patriae , Father of his Country , by all Tuscany for creating a republic out of Florence 's several hundred years of bloody civil war between the opposing factions of Guelphs and Ghibellines , had obtained such happy results . Florence could sack Lorenzo , Il Magnifico , and his palace , on an hour 's notice and drive him out . He knew it , the people knew it , and this knowledge made Lorenzo 's untitled governing work . For  | just as there was no arrogance in him , there was no cowardice : he had saved his father 's life in a dashing military coup while only seventeen and had risked his own life by invading the camp of Ferrante in Naples with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Florence , to save his city from invasion . This was the man who stood just a few feet from Michelangelo , talking affectionately to Bertoldo about some antique sculptures that had just arrived from Asia Minor that day : for sculpture was as important to Lorenzo as his fleets of ships sailing the world 's seas , his chains of banks throughout Europe and the Mediterranean , his millions of golden florins ' worth of produce and trade each year in every commodity from Florence 's wool , oil , wine to the exotic perfumes , flavorings and silks of the Orient . From some Lorenzo commanded respect because of his wealth , from others because of his power ; but by the scholar and artist he was respected and loved for his passion for knowledge ; for the freedom of the mind , imprisoned more than a thousand years in dark dank dungeons , which Lorenzo de ' Medici had pledged himself to liberate . Now Lorenzo stopped to chat with the apprentices . Michelangelo turned his gaze to the girl walking beside him . She was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-sleeved gown of rose-colored wool , a gamurra with its full skirt falling in soft , loose pleats , and a tight-laced bodice under which she wore a pale yellow blouse with a high rounded neck . Her slippers were of brocaded yellow and on her thick dark hair was a rose satin cap encrusted i pearls . She was so pale that not even the rose-colored cap and gown could t blow color into her thin cheeks . As Lorenzo passed his table with an imperceptible nod , suddenly Miclielangelo 's eyes met those of the girl . Ile stopped in his work . She stopped in her walk . He could not take his gaze from this slender , piquant-faced girl . She was startled by the ferocity of expression in his face from the pouring of his energies into the drawing het ore him . Color pulsated upward in her ivory cheeks . Michelangelo felt this awakening between them in quickened breath . For a moment he thought she was going to speak to him , for she moistened her pale lips . Then with a quivering movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put his arm about the girl 's tiny waist . They strolled past the fountain , made their way to the gate and out into the piazza . M ichclangelo turned to Torrigiani . " Who was that ? " " The Magnificent One , you idiot . " No , no , the girl . " " . .. girl ? Oh , Contessina . His daughter . Last one left in the palace . " " Contessina ? Little countess ? " " Yes . Lorenzo used to call his other daughters Contessina ' as a nick-  | name . ' When this puny one was born he had her baptized Contessina . Why do you ask ? " " No reason . " 3 ? Lodovico had never given his consent to Michelangelo 's entering the garden . Although the family knew that he had left the Ghirlandaio studio , ilf they were avoiding the descent into sculpture by declining to acknowledge it . They rarely saw him ; he left at dawn when all were asleep , except his ii stepmother , already out marketing , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fowl , and worked at the garden until dark , loitering as long as possible on the way home so the family would be in bed and there would be only his brother Buonarroto lying awake to ask the news 1 of the day , or his grandmother waiting in the kitchen to give him a light supper . " You 're outgrowing your shirts , Michelagnolo , " Monna Alessandra said , " and your stockings are shabby . Your father feels that since you chose not to earn . . . but no matter . I 've had this money put away . Buy yourself what you need . " He pecked at her leathery cheek ; theirs was the abiding love in the family , and they knew only sketchily how to communicate it . He was austere by nature , and had no desire for things . " I 'll be carving soon and covered from head to foot with stone dust . No one will notice the clothes . " She respected his pride , put the few coins back in a pouch . h @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here for you . " Granacci saw no need to rise so early each morning or to return so late at night ; only at midday did the boys come and go together . Granacci was growing more depressed each day , his hunched-over shoulders seemed only an inch or two above Michelangelo's. i ! " It 's that cold clammy clay , " he complained . " I hate it . I try to model as badly as possible so Bertoldo wo n't tell me I 'm ready for carving . I 've tried pietra dura , hard stone , a dozen times and every blow of the hammer goes i ? I through me instead of the stone . " " But , Granacci , carissimo , marble has resonance , " Michelangelo pleaded . " It 's receptive . Pietra dura is like stale bread . Wait until you work marble , that 's like sinking your fingers into fresh dough . " Granacci searched his friend 's features , puzzled . " You 're so flinty about everything , but put marble in your mouth and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cauldron of drawing . Almost the first sentence Bertoldo uttered to him was : " Here in the garden drawing is the sine qua non ; when you arrive in the morning draw your left hand , then  | take off your shoes and draw your feet ; it 's good practice in foreshortening . " " How about drawing my right hand as well ? " " Another humorist in our midst , " groaned Bertoldo with delight . Even when he had worked the pietra serena for the Topolinos Michelangelo had shifted the hammer from right hand to left , feeling no difference in precision or balance . When he had drawn his left hand from a number of positions he shifted the pen and drew his right , first gazing at his palm , then turning it over with the fingers stretched rigidly outward . Bertoldo came by , picked up the sheet with the half dozen drawings crowding each other on the paper . " The hogshead gives the wine it contains , " he murmured softly . " I took no offense . My right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models were drawn from every quarter of Florence , provided through I , orenzo : scholars in black velvet ; soldiers with bullnecks , square heads and thick arching eyebrows ; swashbuckling toughs ; contadini off their carts ; bald-headed old men with hooked noses and nutcracker chins ; monks in black cloaks , black caps with their flaps turned up over their gray hair ; the gay blades of Florence , handsome , with Greek noses running straight from the brow , curly hair worn low on their necks , round empty eyes ; the wool dyers with stained arms ; the callused ironmongers ; the burly porters ; plump house servants ; nobles in red and white silk hemmed with pearls ; slender boys in violet ; chubby children to serve as models for putti . Michelangelo grumbled at Bertoldo 's harsh criticism of a torso he had drawn : " IIow can we draw only from the outside ? All we see is what pushes against the skin . If we could follow the inside of a body : the bone , muscle . . . To know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guts and blood . Never have I seen the inside of a man . " " Dio fottuto ! " swore Bertoldo softly . " God is scuttled ! Doctors are allowed to dissect one body on a special day of the year , in front of the City Council . Other than this it is the worst crime in Florence . Put it out of your mind . " " My mouth , yes ; my mind , no . I 'll never sculpture accurately until I can sec how a human body works . " " Not even the Greeks dissected , and they were a pagan people without a t ; Lurch to forbid . Nor did Donatello need to cut into a human body for his vclous knowledge . Do you need to be better than Phidias and Dona-tello ? ? " Better , no . Different , yes . " Michelangelo had never seen Bertoldo so agitated . He reached a hand to the old man 's thin arm , patted it quietingly . In spite of these daily shocks , they became friends . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the boy into the casino .0 l , l stood over him for hours while Michelangelo copied Egyptian amulets ,  | Greek medallions , Roman coins , holding each precious work of art in his hand while he explained what the ancient artist had tried to achieve . To his surprise Michelangelo also acquired the devotion of Torrigiani , who now moved his workbench closer to Michelangelo 's . Torrigiani had an overwhelming personality ; he swept Michelangelo off his feet with his charm , his attentions , his vivacity . He was a dandy who garbed himself in colorful silk shirts and a broad belt with gold buckles ; he stopped at the barber in the straw market every morning before coming to work to be shaved and have his hair combed with a perfumed oil . Michelangelo was a messy worker : he got charcoal on his hands , which he then forgetfully rubbed into his face ; he spilled paint on his shirt , ink on his stockings . Torrigiani turned in a good day 's work yet managed to keep immaculate his bright yellow linen camicia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunic with a " T " embroidered on the shoulder in yellow silk , the dark blue jersey calzoni . He had evolved a sculpturing stance which kept the stone dust and chips out of his clothes and hair , unheard of for stonecarvers , who emerge at the end of a day 's work looking like monoliths . He was an object of wonder to Michelangelo , who was flattered when Torrigiani put a powerful arm around his shoulders , held his handsome face close to his and exclaimed about his latest design . " Michelangelo mio , you do the cleanest work and get dirtier doing it than anyone I know . " Torrigiani was always in motion , laughing , posturing , talking good sense and nonsense , but never still , never quiet , waving his hands with their emerald and pearl rings , needing to dominate the air about him . His robust singing voice rang out over the lush spring meadow with its wild flowers , and the scalpellini in the far corner of the garden who were building a library to house Lorenzo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the apprentices walked in the morning to study the early sun on the Giottos in Santa Croce , or the afternoon rays on Filippino Lippi 's Young St. John and Two Saints in Santo Spirito , or to catch the sunset glow on the sculptured figures on the Campanile , designed by Giotto and executed by his pupil , Andrea Pisano , Torrigiani slipped his arm through Michelangelo 's , wooed him , kept him a captive though enchanted audience . " Ali , to be a soldier , Michelangelo . To fight in mortal combat , to kill the enemy with sword and lance , conquer new lands and all their women . That is the life ! An artist ? Bah ! It is work for the sultan 's eunuchs . You and I must travel the world together , amico mio , find combat and danger and treasure . " Nli ( Iu l ; uu elo felt a deep affection for Torrigiani , a love almost . I-ie felt himself to he simple ; to have won the admiration of so beautiful and desirable ; i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one who never drank .  | He now had to unlearn much that he had accumulated at Ghirlandaio 's stns io ecause of the differences my drawing l sco au for scut ture .

The painter draws to occupy space , the sculptor to displace it .

" The painter draw . to reveal the particular , the sculptor draws to unearth the universal . Comprendi ? Understand ? " he demanded , Michelangelo was silent . " Most important of all , the painter draws to externalize , to wrench a shape , out of hi ' h seT land set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internalize , to pull a shape out of the world and solidify it within himself . " Some of this Michelangelo had sensed , but much of it he recognized as the hard wisdom of experience . " 1 am a stufato , a stew , " apologized Bertoldo . " Everything that every sculptor in Tuscany has believed for two centuries has been poured into my head . You must forgive me if it leaks obiter dicta . " Bertoldo , burdened with the task of rearing a new generation of sculptors , was a dedicated teacher , unlike Ghirlandaio , who simply did not have the Time . Sculptors are at best monosyllabic men , the sounds of the hammer and chisel their overlanguage and their true speech , drowning out small voices and smaller worlds . Bertoldo was the exception . " Michelangelo , you draw well . But it is also important to know whyone least draw well .

" u , clangelo held his day 's work in his hand , searching it as though to ui , crsfand better what Bertoldo was saying , seeking to find in it some part uT what Iertoldo wanted there . " Thawing is the supreme way of blotting out your ignorance of a , sub. - c o ( man ex aortec , esta ishing wis. om in its place , just as Dante  | did when he wrote the lines of the Purgatorio . Yes , yes , drawing is like reading : like reading Homer so that you will know about Priam and Helen of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caesars . " Michelangelo lowered his head . " I am ignorant . I do not read Greek or Latin . Urbino tried for three years to teach me , but I was stubborn , I would not learn . I wanted only to draw . " " Stupido ! You have missed my point . No wonder Urbino had trouble teaching you . Drawing is learning . It is discipline , a measuring stick with which to see if there is honesty in you . It 's a confessional ; it will reveal everything about you while you imagine you are revealing someone else . Drawing is the poet 's written line , set down to see if there be a story worth telling , a truth worth revealing . " The old man 's voice became soft , affectionate . " Remember this , figlio mio : to draw is to be like God when He put breath into Adam ; it is the outer breathing of the artist and the inner breathing of the model that creates a new third life on paper . The act of love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : through which everything on earth is born . " Yes drawin was the hr eath of life , he had known that ? yet forhmi.Lwas of an en ns. j He began remaining behind at night , unknown to anyone , picking up tools and working the scraps of stone lying about : yellowish-white traver1 Ij'I tines from the quarries of Rome , pietra forte from Lombrellino , conglomerate breccia from Impruneta , dark green marble from Prato , mottled reddish-yellow marble from Siena , pink marble from Gavorrano , transparent cipollino marble , blue and white flowered bardiglio . But his greatest joy came when someone left behind a fragment of pure white Carrara . As a child he had stood before the marble cutters , hungering to get his hands on this precious stone . It had never been possible ; white marble was rare j and costly , only enough was brought in from Carrara and Seravezza to fulfill commissions . Now surreptitiously he began to experiment with the point , the toothed and flat chisels , working surface textures on the marble as he had on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finest hour of the day for him , alone in the garden , with only the statues for company . Soon , soon , he must have these tools in his hand for good ; he must be able to pick them up first thing in the morning because they were his natural appendages , like arms and legs . He always remembered , when dark fell , to chisel off the contours he had worked so no one would know , to clear away his chips , throwing them into the stone pile in the far end of the garden . Inevitably he was caught ; but by the last person he would have expected to surprise him . Contessina de ' Medici came to the garden nearly every day now , if not with Lorenzo , then with Poliziano or Ficino or Pico della Miraudola , her father 's Platonic scholars . She spoke with Granacci , with  | Sansovino and Rustici , whom she apparently had known a long time ; but no one introduced Michelangelo . She never spoke to him . He knew instantly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was all eyes , when she entered the gate . He felt a heightened consciousness , as though all movement around him , even of the sun and air , had been speeded up . It was Contessina who freed Granacci from the drudgery of stone . He spoke to her of his feelings ; she told her father . One day Lorenzo came into the garden and said : " Granacci , I 'd like a big panel , a Triumph of Paul Emilius . Would you undertake to paint it ? " " Would I ! When need is highest , help is highest . " When Lorenzo turned aside , Granacci pressed his left hand to his lips and fluttered the fingers to Contessina in gratitude . She never paused to look at Michelangelo 's work . Always she stopped at ' I'orrigiani 's table , standing at the far side of the desk so that she was facing Michelangelo , and he could see her every gesture , hear her laughter as Torrigiani amused her . Though he watched , fascinated , their eyes never met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausted . Ile could not understand this . He cared nothing for girls . Not even a year of Jacopo 's tutelage had led him to discern which were " mattressable . " There were no girls in his family , none in their small circle of friends . He could hardly remember having talked to one . He had never even wanted to sketch one ! They were alien to him . Then why was it painful when he saw her laughing in comradeship with Torrigiani , only a few feet away ? Why did he become furious with Torrigiani , and with her ? What could she mean to him , this princess of the noble Medici blood ? It was a kind of mysterious malady . He wished she would stay away from tlac garden , leave him in peace . Rustici said she seldom used to come . Why now , every day , staying for an hour or more ? The more passionately he threw himself at the blank pages the more conscious he was of her standing shivering at Torrigiani 's workbench , flirting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own every stroke of the charcoal like a personal affront . It was a long time , deep into the heat of summer , with the wild flowers dead and the garden meadows burned brown , before he realized that he was jealous . Jealous of Torrigiani . Jealous of Contessina . Jealous of the two of them together . Jealous of each of them separately , apart . And he was appalled . And now she had discovered him in the garden after the others had left . She was with her brother Giovanni , the fat one with the cast in his eye , about his own age , fourteen , Michelangelo would have guessed , already a cardinal-elect ; and her cousin , the illegitimate son of Lorenzo 's beloved brother Giuliano , stabbed to death in the Duomo by Pazzi conspirators .  | Michelangelo had been only three at the time , but Florentines still talked of the sight of the conspirators hanging from the windows of the Signoria . The first words slipped out unannounced . " Buono sera . " " Buono sera . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ va ? " This was Contessina . " Non c'e male . " Like a Settignano stonemason . He had been carving a herringbone pattern on a piece of pietra serena . He did not stop working . " The stone has a smell . " " Of freshly picked figs . " " And this ? " She pointed to a piece of marble on the bench beside him . " Does it smell of freshly picked plums ? " " No , it has hardly any . " He chipped a piece . " Here , smell for yourself . " She crinkled her nose , laughing at him . He set himself before the marble , began raining blows with the chisel that sent the chips flying . " Why do you work so . . . so furiously ? Does n't it exhaust you ? It would me . " He knew of her frailty , the consumption in her family that had taken her mother and sister within the past year . That was why Lorenzo was so devoted to her , Rustici said , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no , cutting stone does not take strength out of you , it puts it back in . Here , try working this white marble . You 'll be amazed at how alive it comes under your hands . " " Under your hands , Michelangelo . Will you finish that design on the pietra serena for me ? " " But it is nothing , just herringbones , such as we carve for garden walks or cistern covers . " " I like it . " " Then I will finish . " She stood still , just above him , as he crouched over the stone . When he came to a hard spot he looked around for a bucket of water , saw none , spat precisely on the area he wanted to soften , then continued the sweep of the chisel over the stone . Amused , she asked , " What do you do when you run dry ? " He gazed up at her , his face flushed . " No good scalpellino ever ran out of spit . "  | With the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Soggi . His enthusiasm had been withering like the grass of the meadow . He had won no prizes or commissions , and although Bertoldo had been paying him a few coins , his earnings were higher only than Michelangelo 's , which were non-existent . For this reason Soggi thought that Michelangelo might join with him . One breathless evening late in August he waited until everyone had left , then flung down his tools and came to the newest apprentice . " Michelangelo , let 's you and I get out of here . All this stuff is so . . . so impractical . Let 's save ourselves while there is still time . " " Save ourselves , Soggi ? From what ? " " Look , do n't be blind . They 're never going to give us any commissions or money . Who really needs sculpture in order to live ? " " I do . " The emotions of disgust , renunciation and even fear carved on Soggi 's lace were more eloquent than anything the lad had been able to work into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to find work ? If Lorenzo should die ... " " But he 's a young man , only forty . " " ... then we would have no more patron , no more garden . Are we to wander about Italy like beggars with hats in our hands ? Do you need a marble cutter ? Could you use a Madonna ? A Pieta ? I can make you one , if only you 'll give me a roof and victuals . " Soggi swept his few personal possessions into a bag . " Ma che ! I want to be in a trade where folks come to me . Every day ! For pasta or pork , for wine or calzoni . People ca n't live without these things , every day they must buy . So every day I must sell . On what I sell , I will live . I have a practical nature , I have to know that each day I will earn so many soldi . Sculpture is the last of the luxuries , on the very bottom of the list . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list . What do you say , Michelangelo ? They have n't paid you a single scudo . Look how ragged your clothes are . Do you want to live like a pauper all your life ? Quit now , with inc . We 'll find jobs together ... " Soggi 's outburst was deeply felt ; it had been building up for weeks , perhaps months . Yet at the back of his mind Michelangelo was a little amused . " Sculpture is at the top of my list , Soggi . In fact , there is no list . I say , ' Sculpture , ' and I 'm finished . " " Finished is right ! " agreed Soggi . " My father knows a butcher on the 1'c11tc Vecchio who is looking for help . The chisel , it 's just like a knife .... " ' 1 ' he next morning when Bertoldo heard of Soggi 's departure he shrugged .  | " The casualties of sculpture . Everyone is born with a little talent ; but dill with most people , how quickly the flame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thin white hair . " We always had this in the studios . You start out knowing that a certain amount of teaching will be wasted ; but you ca n't withhold for that reason , or all your apprentices will suffer . These Soggi , their prompting is not love or affinity for sculpture , but the exuberance of youth . As soon as this first flush begins to fade they say to themselves , Stop dreaming . Look for a reliable way of life . ' When you are the master of a bottega you will find this to be true . Sculpture is hard , brutal labor . One should not become an artist because he can , but because he must . It is only for those who would be miserable without it . " The next morning moonfaced Bugiardini , no taller , but plumper , arrived as the new apprentice for the garden . Michelangelo and Granacci embraced him warmly . Granacci , having completed his painting for Lorenzo , had shown so much talent at organization that Lorenzo had asked him to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive , spending his days making sure that the proper stone , iron or bronze arrived , setting up contests for the apprentices , getting modest commissions from the Guilds . " Granacci , you must n't , " protested Michelangelo . " You have as much talent as anybody in this garden . " " But I enjoy it , " replied Granacci mildly . " Then stop enjoying it . If we need charcoal , or a model , let us get them II for ourselves . Why should you give up your work to help us get ours done ? " Granacci was not insensible to the compliment embedded in Michelangelo 's fury . " There 's time for everything , caro mio , " he replied . " I have painted . I will paint again . " But when Granacci returned to painting Michelangelo was angrier than ever : for Lorenzo had pressed him into service to design stage settings for a morality play , banners and arches for a pageant . " Granacci , idiota , how can you stand here singing so happily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the pageant ? " " But I like doing what you call trivia . Everything does n't have to be profound and eternal . A pageant or a party are important because people get pleasure from them , and pleasure is one of the most important things in life , as important as food or drink or art . " " You . . . you . . . Florentine ! "  | As the days of fall deepened , so did Michelangelo 's friendships . On feast days or church holidays , when the garden was locked tight , Rustici invited him for dinner , then took him through the countryside looking for horses , paying farmers , stablemen , grooms for the privilege of drawing in their barns and fields . " Horses are the most beautiful of God 's creatures , " exclaimed Rustici . " You must draw them over and over again , every horse you can find . " " But , Rustici , I never intend to sculpture a horse . Only men . " " Once you know a horse , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arezzo , twice Michelangelo 's age , had his own philosophy . " An artist must return frequently to the soil ; he must plow it , sow it , weed it , harvest the grain . The contact with the earth renews us . To be only an artist is to feed on oneself , and go barren . That is why I ride my mule home to Arezzo every few weeks . You must come with me , Michelangelo , and feel the tilled earth under your feet . " " I 'd like to visit Arezzo with you , Sansovino , if there 's any marble I can plow a furrow through . " It was only at home that he was unhappy . Lodovico had managed to keep a rough check on how much each of the apprentices at the garden was receiving of prize money , awards and commissions ; he knew that Sansovino , Torrigiani and Granacci were earning good sums . " But not you ? " Lodovico demanded . " Not one single scudo . " " Not yet . " " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not you ? " " I do n't know . " " I can only come to one conclusion : that you ca n't compete with the others . " " I have not . " " Would n't Lorenzo know if you had any talent as a sculptor ? " " Undoubtedly . " " But he has never noticed you ? " " Never . " " Allora ! I 'll give you another four months to make it a full year . Then if I , orenzo still thinks you 're dry fruit , you 'll go to work . " But Lodovico 's patience lasted only four weeks . He cornered Michelangelo in his bedroom of a Sunday morning . " Does Bertoldo praise your work ? " " No . " " Does he say you have talent ? "  | " No . " " He gives no encouragement ? " " He gives me instruction . " " It is not the same thing . " " Ammesso . Admitted . " " Does he praise the others ? " " Sometimes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " It could not be . " " Why not ? " " I draw better than they . " " Draw . What does that mean ? If they are training you to be a sculptor , why do n't you sculpture ? " " Bertoldo wo n't let me . " " Why not ? " " He says I 'm not ready . " " But the others sculpture ? " " Yes . " " And they show no sign of letting you start on the stone ? " " None . " " Does n't it look hopeless to you ?

" Michelangelo walked over to Lodovico 's chair and put a finger lightly on his father 's shoulder . " ' Trust me , Father . I am not looking for wool on an ass . " Affairs grew no better for him at the garden ; they seemed indeed to become worse . Bertoldo was pushing him hard , never pleased with anything he did , jumping from one foot to the other crying : " No , no , you can do it better . Again ! Again .

" " When Bertoldo considers you ready to enter contests , he 'll say so . Until then ... " " 0 Dio ! " swore Michelangelo under his breath . " Until then I 'll be sleeping in the Loggia della Signoria where my father ca n't get at me with a stick . " There was something else he was unhappy about but could not mention to Granacci : with the wet weather Lorenzo had forbidden Contessina to leave the palace . To Michelangelo she did not seem frail . Ile felt a flame in her , a flame strong enough to consume death . Now that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the days long and unbroken without the excitement of waiting . In his loneliness he turned to Torrigiani . They became inseparable . Michelangelo raved about Torrigiani : of his wit , his flair , his physique . . . Granacci raised an eyebrow . " Michelangelo , I am in a difficult position : I ca n't say too much without  | appearing jealous and hurt . But I must warn you . Torrigiani has done this before . " " Done what ? " " Lavished his affection , won someone over completely , only to fly into a rage and break off the relationship when there is someone new to romance . Torrigiani needs an audience ; you are providing him with that audience . Do not confuse this use with loving you . " Bertoldo was not so gentle . When he saw a drawing of Michelangelo 's in which he had imitated one that Torrigiani had just completed , he tore it into a hundred shreds . " Walk with a cripple for a year and at the end you will limp . Move your desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Michelangelo had reached a boundary of patience . He put an arm as brittle as an autumnal leaf about the boy 's shoulder . " And so : on to sculpture . " Michelangelo buried his head in his hands ; his amber-colored eyes were intense with feeling , sweat broke out on his forehead . Relief , joy , misery were mixed together , making his heart pound and hands tremble . " Now what is sculpture ? " demanded Bertoldo in a mentor 's tone . " It is the I ' art which , by removing all that is superfluous from the material under treatment , reduces it to that form designed in the artist 's mind ... " " With hammer and chisel , " exclaimed Michelangelo , recovering his calm . ... or by successive additions , " persisted Bertoldo , " as in modeling in clay or wax , which is by the method of putting on . " Michelangelo shook his head vigorously . " Not for me . I want to work directly on the marble . I want to work as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stone . " Bertoldo smiled wryly . " A noble ambition . But it takes a long time for an Italian to reach back to the Greeks . First you must learn to model in clay and wax . Not until you have mastered the putting-on method can you dare the method of removing . " " No stone ? " " No stone . Your wax models should be about a foot high . I had Granacci buy a supply of wax for you . To render it supple we use a little of this animal ' II fat . So . If on the other hand you need more tenacity , you add turpentine . Va bene ? " While the wax was melting Bertoldo showed him how to make an armature , using sticks of wood or iron wires , and after the wax had cooled , how to make it into rolls . Once the framework was up , Michelangelo started  | applying the wax to see how close he could come to creating a threedimensional figure from a two-dimensional drawing . This then was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duomo . For this he had argued the virtues of sculpture over painting . The real task of the sculptor : depth , the round , the dimension that the painter could only suggest by the illusion of perspective . His was the harsh world of reality ; no one could walk around his drawing , but anyone could walk around his sculpture , and judge it from every side . " And so it must be perfect , not only from the front but from every angle , " said Bertoldo . " Which means that every piece has to be sculptured not once but three hundred and sixty times , because at each change of degree it becomes a different piece . " Michelangelo was fascinated ; Bertoldo 's voice swept through him like a flame . " Capisco . I understand . " Ile took the wax , felt the warmth against his palms ; for hands hungry for stone , the roll of wax could not be pleasant . But Bertoldo 's words gave him impetus to see if he could build a head , torso , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not easy . " But the sooner begun , " he cried , " the sooner ended . " After he had massed his wax on the skeletal frame he followed Bertoldo 's orders to work it with tools of iron and bone . After achieving the roughest approximation , he refined it with his strong fingers . The results had a touch of verisimilitude , some raw power . " But no grace whatever , " criticized Bertoldo ; " and not the slightest facial tr , cmblance . " " I 'm not doing portraiture , " growled Michelangelo , who absorbed instruction like a dehydrated sponge thrown into the Arno , but bridled at criticism . " You will . " " May I speak plainly ? " " I lave you any other way ? " " The devil with portraiture . I never will like it . " " Never is longer at your age than mine . When you 're hungry and the Duke of Milan asks you to do his portrait in a bronze medallion . . . " Michelangelo glowered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held his ground . He talked of expression and grace and balance . ( ) t t he interrelation of the body to the head : if the figure had the face of an old mean , it had to have the arms , body , legs , hands and feet of an old man . If it had the face of a youth , it had in like manner to be round , soft and sweet In expression , the flow of the drapery had to be turned so it suggested a young nude beneath . The hair and beard had to be worked with delicacy . liau  --  cio was the leaven . On those days when Torrigiani had the vapors and milks ; or Sansovino was suddenly homesick for Arezzo ; or Michelangelo recd to move ahead to clay ; when Bertoldo reproved Rustici for drawing  | horses while sketching from a male model ; when Granacci developed a splitting headache from the constant noise of hammer on chisel ; when Bertoldo , racked with cough , moaned that he could have saved himself a lot of trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment that Baccio rushed to the rescue , bringing with him the humor of the wineshops and brothels .

' If you went to bed with me more often , ' replied the young wife tartly , It would cost you only a penny each time . ' " " No , I do n't keep him on as the garden clown , " explained Bertoldo . " He ' y1 has a promise of talent and is never unperceptive . Baccio as much as anyone in this garden has the will to dedication . He does n't like to study , he is dedicated to purity ; perhaps that 's why Baccio is devoted to lasciviousness . " The weeks passed . Bertoldo insisted that Michelangelo perfect himself in the transcription from charcoal to wax . When Michelangelo could stand no more he threw down his bone tools , walked to the far end of the garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fury cutting building blocks for Lorenzo 's library . The foreman , not sure he should permit this uprising , asked the first time : " Why do you come to us ? " " I must wear this wax off my fingers . " " Where did you learn to chip stone ? " " In Settignano . " " Ah i " Each day for an hour or two he worked with the scalpellini . The pietra serena blocks between his legs and under his hand lent him durity . Bertoldo capitulated . " Alla guerra di amor vince chi f ugge , " ' he said . " ' In a love fight , he who flees is the winner . ' We will go on to clay . . . . Remember that clay worked in a damp state shrinks .

" " You 've used the word , " grinned Michelangelo . " I must be getting closer . " February closed in , with fogs down from the mountains and rain enveloping the walled city until every street became a river . There were few hours of gray light to work by , the churches and palaces were too damp to visit for copying . They were confined to the inner rooms of the casino , with each apprentice sitting on a high stool over a brazier of hot coalBertoldo was s. forced to remain in bed for days at a time . The wet clay seemed clammier and colder than ever . Frequently Michelangelo worked by oil light , fie-  | quently alone in the icy casino , not happy , but more content to be here than anywhere else . April was only a couple of months away . And so was Lodovico 's decision to take him out of the garden if he had not reached some paid capacity . Bertoldo , when he came wrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michelangelo knew that he must speak . He showed Bertoldo the clay figures he had been modeling , asked permission to copy them in stone . " No , figlio mio , " croaked Bertoldo hoarsely , " you are not ready . " " The others are ; I am not ? " " You have much to learn . " " Admitted . " " Pazienza , " exclaimed Granacci . " God shapes the back to the burden . " There were several thorns festering . Bertoldo drove him the hardest , accompanied by a constant stream of criticism ; try as he might , Michelangelo could earn no word of praise . Another sore spot was that he still had not bcen invited to the palace . Bertoldo would cry : " No , no , this modeling is overcaressed ; when you see the sculpture in the pa lace you will understand that marble wants to express only the most intense and profound of sentiments . " Michelangelo thought , " Well then , invite me , and I will see ! " When Lorenzo invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Bertoldo ? Lorenzo ? Himself ? He could not tell . The exclusion implied rejection . He felt like the ass who carries gold and eats thistles . ' I ' hen , on a cold but sharply bright end-of-March day , Bertoldo stood over a clay model Michelangelo had just completed from studies of ancient demigods , half human , half animal . " ' There 's a newly discovered Faun at the palace , " said Bertoldo . " We unpacked it last night . Pagan Greek , beyond doubt . Ficino and Landino think about the fifth century before Christ . You must see it . " Michelangelo held his breath . " Right now would be the best time . Come along . " They crossed the Piazza San Marco and turned down the Via Larga . Bertoldo raised one layer of the heavy wool scarf wound double around his neck , placed it across the lower half of his face to protect his mouth from the piercing cold . On the Via de ' Gori side the Medici palace had used the wall td t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michelozzo had completed it thirty years before for Cosimo . It was large enough to house a tlmucrons family of three generations , the government of a republic , the nnucagencent of a world-wide business , a center for artists and scholars who toweled to Florence : a combined home , office , shop , university , bottega ,  | art gallery , theater and library : austere , with a majestic simplicity that characterized the taste of the Medici . " There is no bad art in the palace , " said Bertoldo . The stonework thrilled Michelangelo as he paused on the Via Larga for a moment to gaze in admiration . Though he had seen the palace a hundred times it always seemed fresh and new . What superb craftsmen these scalpellini were . Each rough protruding block of the rustic ground floor was chiseled with the authority of a piece of sculpture : the surface resourcefully textured by the calcagnolo , the edges beveled with a lyrical " curve-out-ofmass " that made the huge blocks sing ; and no two stones any more duplicates than two marble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a row of iron rings to which visitors ' horses were fastened ; at the corners were large bronze holders in which the night torches were placed . Around the palace on both streets ran a high stone bench on which the convivial Florentines could chat and sun themselves . " Each stone of the rustic is so good , " said Michelangelo , breaking the silence , " it could be set up on a pedestal and placed in the loggia . " " Perhaps , " agreed Bertoldo , " but for me , too ponderous . They make a building look too much like a fort . I prefer those flat regular stone panels of the second floor , and even better the miniature stones of the third floor , each carved like a gem . That 's what makes the palace grow lighter as it rises in space . " " I have never realized , " said Michelangelo , " architecture is almost as great I'I ! an art as sculpture . " Bertoldo smiled indulgently . ' I 111 " Giuliano da Sangallo , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sculpture : the designing of forms to occupy space . If the architect is not a sculptor all he gets is enclosed walls . If you need work , you will design a palace instead of a Pieta . " The corner of the Via Larga and Via de ' Gori was an open loggia which the Medici family used for their feasts and festivities , considered as entertainments by the Florentines , who insisted on seeing what was going on . The loggia had magnificent thirty-foot arches carved out of pietra forte , strong stone ; it was here that citizens , merchants and politicos came to confer with Lorenzo , artists and students to discuss their projects . For all there was a glass of sweet white Greco wine , " the perfect drink for gentlemen , " and a cake of welcome . They entered through the massive gate and came into the square courtyard held up with its three complete arches on each side P by twelve heroic columns with decorated capitals . Bertoldo pointed proudly to a series of eight sculptured classical figures between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' They 're mine . I copied them from antique gems . You 'll see the originals  | in Lorenzo 's collection in his studiolo . They 're so good people mistake them for Donatellos ! " Michelangelo frowned : how could Bertoldo be content to run so far behind his master ? Then his eye moved to two of the great sculptures of the city : the Davids of Donatello and of Verrocchio . He rushed with a cry of joy to touch the pieces . Bertoldo came to stand by him , running his practiced hand over the magnificent bronze surfaces . " I helped cast this piece for Cosimo . It was intended to stand right here in this courtyard , to be looked at from every side . Flow excited we were ! For centuries we had had only the relief , or figures attached to their background . This was the first isolated bronze to be cast in more than a thousand years . Before Donatello , sculpture was used to ornament architecture : in niches , doors , choir stalls and pulpits . Donato was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Michelangelo gazed openmouthed at Donatello 's David , so young and soft , with long curls of hair and high-nippled breasts , the slender arm holding a gigantic sword , the left leg curved so gracefully to put the open-sandaled foot on Goliath 's decapitated head . It was a double miracle , Michelangelo thought : that the bronze casting had come out with such a satin-smooth perfection ; for this he knew Bertoldo shared the credit ; and that so delicate a figure , almost as slight as Contessina 's , could have killed Goliath . he had only another moment to study three Roman sarcophagi under the arches , and two restored statues of Marsyas , before Bertoldo started up the great staircase to the chapel above , with its Gozzoli frescoes so brilliant in color that Michelangelo cried out in astonishment . Then as Bertoldo led him from room to room his head began to spin : or here was a veritable forest of sculptures and gallery of paintings . He did not have enough eyes in his head or strength in his legs to move from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No good Italian artist since Giotto or Nicola Pisano was unrepresented . Marbles by Donatello and tcsiderio da Settignano , by Luca della Robbia and Verrocchio , bronzes by Net t oldo .

There were ( : astaguos , Filippo Lippis , Pollaiuolos and a hundred others from Venice and Bruges . They reached Lorenzo 's studiolo , the last of a suite of beautiful rooms on what was called " the noble floor of the palace , " not Lorenzo 's office but Ins small writing room , its vault sculptured by Luca della Robbia , Lorenzo 's desk against the back wall under the shelves that held his treasures : jewels , cameos , small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | crowded room intended more for pleasure than work , with small painted tables by Giotto and Van Eyck , antique bronzes and a nude Hercules above the fireplace , small bronze heads on the lintels above the doors , glass vases designed by Ghirlandaio . ; ' " What do you think ? " Bertoldo demanded . " Nothing . Everything . My brain is paralyzed . " " I 'm not surprised . Here is the Faun that arrived from Asia Minor yesterday . His eyes are telling you how much he has reveled in the carnal joys . Must have been the first Florentine ! Now I will leave you for a few minutes while I get something from my room . " Michelangelo went close to the Faun . He found himself looking into I ' II gleaming , gloating eyes . The long beard was stained as though red wine had been spilled in merriment . It seemed so intensely alive that Michelangelo felt it was about to speak , yet inside the wicked smile the lips and teeth were no longer visible . He ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carving , but it was gone . he threw back his head and laughed , the stone room echoing the sound . The blood had begun to circulate again in his veins . " Have you lost your mouth by boasting of your droll adventures ? " he cried out to the Faun . Then he took drawing paper and red crayon from inside his shirt , sat at the far side of the room and sketched the Faun , giving it lips , teeth and an impudent tongue , as he imagined they would have appeared when the Greek sculptor carved them two thousand years before . He felt someone at his shoulder , then a faint perfume came to his nostrils , He whirled about abruptly . Many weeks had passed since he had seen her . She was so slight a little ! ' body , displacing such a modest amount of space . Her eyes were omnivorous , consuming the rest of her pale sensitive features by dissolving them in the warm brown liquid of her pupils . She was dressed in a blue gamurra trimmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sleeves . In her hand was a Greek parchment copy of Isocrates ' Orations . He sat motionless , consumed like herself in her eyes . " Michelangelo . " How could there be so much joy from this mere pronouncing of a name which one heard all day without emotion ? " Contessina . " " I was studying in my room . Then I knew someone was here . " " I did not dare hope I would see you . Bertoldo brought me to see the art . " " Father wo n't let me come with him to the garden until spring . You do not think I will die ? " " You will live to bear many sons . " Color flooded her cheeks . " I have not offended you ? " he asked apologetically .  | She shook her head . " They told me you were blunt . " She took a step or two closer to his chair . " When I am near you I feel strong . Why ? " " When I am near you I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , light sound . " I miss the garden . " " The garden misses you . " " I should not have thought it noticed . " " It noticed . " She turned from the intensity in his voice . " Your work , it goes well ? " " Non c'e male . " " You 're not very communicative . " " I do not aspire to be a talker . " " Then you should mask your eyes . " " What do they say ? " " Things that please me . " " Then tell me . I carry no mirror . " " What we know of others is our personal secret . " He felt exposed , humiliated for showing any emotion which he could not name . He picked up his sketching paper . " I must work now . " She stamped her foot . " One does not dismiss a Medici . " Anger flared into her eyes , darkening their translucence to opaque , then a tiny smile moved in . " You will not hear such stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a variety of my own . " She put out her hand . It was small , the fingers as fragile as birds in his rough , powerful paw . He knew enough not to squeeze . Then after an instant he felt a stirring , a warmth , a robust shaking of his hand in her strong grasp . " Addio , Michelangelo . " " Addio , Contessina . " " Work well . " " Grazie mille . " She was gone , out the door of her father 's study , leaving behind a faint perfume in his nostrils , a forging of the blood in his hand as though he had been working with a perfectly balanced Swedish iron chisel . he applied the red crayon to the paper . 9 ? That night he tossed and turned , sleepless . His first year in the garden was almost up . Suppose that Lodovico should go to Lorenzo , as he had threatened , and demand that his son be released ? Would Lorenzo be willing to  | antagonize a good Florentine family ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet he simply could not go away without once having got his hands , on a piece of stone . He could stand the empty-handed hunger no longer . He leaped out of bed , hurtled into his clothes in the moonlight , bent on reaching Settignano by dawn and spending the day cutting pietra serena blocks and columns . But when he had run noiselessly down the circular staircase to the Via dei II Bentaccordi he stopped short . Into his mind there flashed the picture of himself working with the sealpellini at the rear of the garden where all L , ail stones were stored . He saw one in particular , a modest-sized piece of white marble , lying in the grass a short distance from the building blocks . It came ' 1 ; I to his mind that this block was exactly the right size for the piece of sculpture i he envisioned : a Faun like the one in Lorenzo 's studiolo , but his own ! Instead of turning to his left and following the street of the ditch toward the open country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benci with its handsome , sleeping Bardi palaces to the high wooden gate in the city wall , identified himself to a guard , crossed the Ponte alle Grazie and climbed up to the ruins of the Belvedere fort , and sat on a parapet with the shimmering Arno at his feet . Florence , luminous in the full moonlight , so close that he felt he could touch the Signoria or Duomo with his fingers , was a sight of such incredible beauty that he drew in his breath sharply . No wonder the young men of the city sang their romantic ballads to their town , with whom no girl could compete . All true Florentines said , " I will not live out of sight of the Duomo . " For him the city was a compact mass of pietra serene , the streets cut through with a mason 's chisel , looking like dark rivers , the cobbled piazzas gleaming white in the moonlight . The palaces stood sentinel , a couple of ranges higher than the modest houses clustered so tightly about them ; and piercing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santa Maria Novella , the magnificent three-hundred-foot thrust of the Signoria . Making a little group of its own were the great red dome of the cathedral , the glistening small white dome of the Baptistery , the noble flesh pink of the Campanile . Around all was the turreted , tower-studded city wall . And sitting there , above his beloved city , he knew what he must do . The moon was beginning to sink beyond the hills ; the last of the mist of luminous gray powder settled down on the housetops and was absorbed . Light subtly suggested itself in the east , then flared as though the sun had been hovering jealously below the horizon waiting only a signal to precipitate itself upon the stage of the Arno Valley and rout the magical mystical moonlight with fierce proof of its own greater power to light , to heat , to ' I ! make everything known . Cocks began to crow in the farms upriver , bordering the marsh Iake ; the guards at the gate gave the cries to open the heavy f ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill , walked along the river to the Ponte Vecchio , the bridge with its meat stalls just being opened by sleepy apprentices , and continued down to the Piazza San Marco and the garden . He went directly to the marble block in the grass beyond the new building site , picked it up in his arms and struggled under its weight down the path to the rear . Here he righted a sawed tree trunk , set the marble block securely upon it . Ile knew he had no right to touch this marble , that at least by implication he had rebelled against the authority of the garden , overthrown Bertoldo 's iron-edged discipline . Well , he was on his way out anyway if his father had his say ; and if Bertoldo was going to sack him , let it be done in front of a piece of sculpture for which he had been brought here in the first place .

In the back of his mind a voice said : " ' Phis is love . " I le was not frightened , or even startled . He recognized it for the simple tenth . It was his primary need that his love be reciprocated . Marble was the hero of his life ; and his fate . Not until this very moment , with his hands tenderly , lovingly on the marble , had he come fully alive . For this was what he wanted to be all his life : a white-marble sculptor , not ! ling more , nothing less . Ile picked up Torrigiani 's tools and set to work : without drawing , withnut wax or clay model , without even charcoal markings on the tough outer in of the marble .

For three nights he had worked behind the v siiiu ; for three days he had hidden it beneath a wool cloth . Now he carried to his workbench . Now he was willing for Bertoldo to see it : his own Faun , with full sensual lips , set of saucy white teeth , insouciant tongue bandy peeping through . He was polishing the top of the head with pietra tudita and water to grind away the tool markings and white dots when the  | apprentices arrived and Lorenzo came down the walk . He stopped in front of the workbench . " Ah , the Faun from my studiolo , " said Lorenzo . " Yes . " " You left out his beard . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is n't the job of the copyist to copy ?

" " I was n't questioning his age . It 's just that you left him all his teeth . " Michelangelo gazed at his statue . it " I was making amends for the other mouth that decayed . " I " You should have known that there are always some wanting in fellows of his age . " " In a man , yes . But in fauns ? " He could not resist an impish grin .

" " The sculptor is master of time : he can age his subjects forward or back . " Lorenzo seemed pleased . " I see you have removed an upper tooth . And two lower ones in the other corner . " " For balance . " " You have also closed his gums where the teeth had been . " Michelangelo 's eyes danced . " It was perceptive of you to rework the entire mouth .

Then he too left .  | The next morning a page in varicolored stockings and scarlet coat appeared in the garden . Bertoldo called out : " Michelangelo , you are wanted at the palace . Accompany the page . " " You 've gotten yourself sacked ! " exclaimed Baccio . " For stealing that marble . " Michelangelo looked at Bertoldo , then Granacci . Their expressions told him nothing . He went with the page , entered the rear garden through an old hattlemented wall , stared with bulging eyes at the box trees cut into the shape of elephants , stags , ships under full sail . He stopped short in front of a fountain with a granite basin on which stood Donatello 's bronze Judith . " If you please , sir , " cried the page , " II Magni fern must not be kept waiting .

There were only two pieces of sculpture in the room , marble busts of I , orenzo 's father and uncle by Mino da Fiesole . Michelangelo walked quickly to the bust of Piero , Lorenzo 's father , his fare flushed . " See this high polish : as though a thousand candles were burning within . " I , orenzo rose , stood by Michelangelo 's  --  side to study the sculpture . " ' That was Mino 's special gift : he could make white marble appear like watrui flesh .

Then Mino had courage . " I n the silence that followed Michelangelo 's face suddenly went crimson . I le bowed stiffly from the waist . " I did not present my greetings , messere . I became excited about the sculpture and began talking . " I , orenzo waved this aside . " I forgive you . How old are you , Michelangelo ? " " Fifteen . " " Who is your father ? "  | " Lodovico di Lionardo Buonarroti-Simoni . " " I have heard the name . " He opened his desk , took out a parchment folio . From it he spread out dozens of drawings . Michelangelo could not believe what he saw . " But . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just so . " " Bertoldo told me he destroyed them . " Lorenzo leaned over his desk toward him . " We have put many obstacles , in your path , Michelangelo . Bertoldo has borne down hard , with harsh criticism and little praise or promise of reward . We wanted to make sure you had . . . stamina . We knew you had a real talent but did not know your it character . If you had left us for lack of praise or money awards ... " There was a silence in the beautiful room , permeated with the delicious aromas of parchment pages , leather bindings and freshly printed sheets . Michelangelo 's eyes roamed the walls , seeing titles in a dozen different languages of which he could make out not a letter . His back teeth had so locked 11 that his tongue had no room to move or speak . Lorenzo came around to the boy 's side . " Michelangelo , you have the makings of a sculptor . Bertoldo and I are convinced that you could become heir to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent . I should like you to come and live in the palace . As a member of my family . From now on you need concern yourself only with sculpture . " " I like best to work in marble . " Lorenzo chuckled . " No thanks , no expression of pleasure at coming to live in the palace of a Medici . Only your feeling for marble . " " Is n't that why you invited me ? " " Senz'altro . Will you bring your father to me ? " " Tomorrow . What must I call you ? " " What you will . " " Not Magnifico . " " Why not ? " " What meaning has a compliment if one hears it night and day . . . " ... from the lips of sycophants ? " " I did not say that . " " With what name do you think of me ? " " Lorenzo . " " You speak it with affection . " " So I feel . " " Do not in the future ask me what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpected from you . " Once again Granacci offered to plead for him with Lodovico . Lodovico could make no sense out of what Granacci was telling him .  | " Granacci , you are leading my son astray . " " The Medici palace is not really astray , Messer Buonarroti ; they say it is the finest palace in Europe . " " But what does it mean , a stonecutter in a fine palace ? It is the same as a groom . " " Michelangelo is not a stonecutter . He is a sculptor . " " Non importa . Under what terms does he go into the palace ? " " You do not understand , messere : he is not to be paid . " " Not to be paid ! Another year of waste ! " " Il Magnifico has asked Michelangelo to come to live in the palace . He will be as a member of the family . He will eat at table with the great of the world . . . " " Who eats with the powerful will have his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will learn from the Plato Academy , the finest scholars of Italy , " continued Granacci stolidly . " And he will have marble to carve . " " Marble , " groaned Lodovico , as though the word were anathema . " You can not refuse to speak to Il Magnifier ) . " " 1 will go , " mumbled Lodovico . " What else can I do ? But I do n't like it , not at all . " In the palace , standing before Lorenzo in the studiolo , with Michelangelo at his side , the son found the father humble , almost pathetic . And he felt sorry for him . " Buonarroti-Simoni , we would like Michelangelo to live with us here , and become a sculptor . Everything will be provided for him . Will you concede the boy ? " " Magnifico messere , I know not how to deny you , " replied Lodovico , bowing deeply . " Not only Michelangelo , but all of us , with our lives and wits , arc at the pleasure of Your Magnificence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I have never followed any craft or trade . I have lived on my meager innc , attending to the few possessions left to me by my ancestors . " " Then make use of me . See if there is in Florence something I can do for yttt . I will favor your interest to the utmost of my power . " Iodovico glanced at his son , then looked away . " I know not how to do anything but read and write . The companion of Marco Pucci in the customhouse has just died , and I should be pleased to have his place . " " The customhouse ! It pays only eight scudi a month . " " It seems to me I could fitly discharge that office . " Lorenzo raised both hands to elbow height , shook his fingers as though It ) tid t hem of water . " I had expected you would request something much grander . But if you titanic to become the companion of Pucci , you can do so . "  | He turned back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark homely face . " It is sixty years since my grandfather Cosimo invited Donatello into his home to execute the bronze statue of David . " ROOK THREE : The Palace PAGE escorted him up the grand staircase and along the corridor to an apartment opposite the central courtyard . The page knocked . Bertoldo opened the door . " Welcome , Michelangelo , to my home . Il Magnifico thinks I have so little time left , lie wants me to teach you in my sleep . " Michelangelo found himself in an L-shaped interior dividing into separate rooms . There were two wooden beds covered with white blankets and red coverlets , each with a coffer at its foot . Bertoldo had his bed on the inside of the I , ; covering a wall above his head was a painted tapestry representing the Palazzo della Signoria . There was a big cupboard turned catercorner against the inside angle of the L , filled with Bertoldo 's books , including the pigskin-bound manuscript of his cookbook , bronze candlesticks which hr had designed for Donatello ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of his sculptures . Michelangelo 's bed was in the door half of the L , from which he could ece the sculptures on the cupboard but nothing of Bertoldo 's bed area . On the wall opposite the bed was a wooden tablet with the Baptistery painted on it , and next to a window overlooking the Via de ' Gori a hatrack and a table with a vase and pitcher of water . " This arrangement will give us privacy , " said Bertoldo . " Put your things to he coffer at the foot of your bed . If you have any valuables I 'll lock them In this antique chest . " Michelangelo glanced at his small bundle of clothes and darned stockings . " My only valuables are my two hands : I like to keep them by my side . " " ' I'Iccy 'll take you farther than your feet will . " ' I'hev retired early , Bertoldo lighting the candles in the bronze holders while sent flickering fingers of light into both wings . They could not see tuc Ic tither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they could talk in a quiet tune . The one thing they could both see was the catercornered cupboat d , with the models of Bertoldo 's work . " Your sculptures look beautiful in the candlelight . " Bel I old() was silent for a moment . " Poliziano says , Bertoldo is not a sculptor n ncini:utnres , he is a miniature sculptor . ' "  | Michelangelo drew in his breath sharply . Bertoldo heard the sound of protest , said softly : " There is an element of truth in that cruel witticism . Is n't it a bit pathetic that from your pillow you can take in with one glance my whole lifetime of work ? " " But , Bertoldo , sculpture is n't measured by how many pounds it weighs . " " By any measurement it is a modest contribution . Talent is cheap ; dedication is expensive . It will cost you your life . " " What else is life for ? " Bertoldo sighed . " Alas , I thought it was for many things : falconing , testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adage , Life is to be enjoyed . ' The sculptor must create a body of work . He must produce for fifty to sixty years , as Ghiberti and Donatello did . He must produce enough to permeate the whole world . " The old man was tired . Michelangelo heard him sigh into sleep . He himself lay awake , his bands locked behind his head . He could think of no difference between " Life is to be enjoyed " and " Life is work . " Here he was , living in the Medici palace , enjoying the contemplation of unlimited art works to study , and a corner of the sculpture garden full of beautiful marble to carve . He fell asleep with a smile on his lips . He woke with the first sunlight , quietly dressed and went out into the halls of the palace . He ran his hands over the antique marble of Marsyas , the figures of Faustina and Africanus ; studied the richly colored Venetian paintings in what appeared to be a withdrawing room ; contrasted portraits in paint by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent an hour in the chapel glorying in the Benozzo Gozzoli frescoes of the Three Wise Men of the East coming down the hill from Fiesole ; knocked on doors and entered to find himself gazing in wide-eyed wonder and awe at Donatello 's Ascension , Masaccio 's St. Paul , Uccello 's Battle of San Romano .. . until he became so lightheaded he thought he must be in a dream . At eleven he returned to his room to find that the palace tailor had left a new outfit on his bed . In a festive mood he slipped on the colorful silks , then stood before the mirror surveying himself with satisfaction . It was amazing how much more attractive the new clothes made him look , the crimson berretto sending color into his cheeks , the cowl collar of the violet cloak making his head seem better proportioned , the golden shirt and stockings adding a sheen of gaiety . He remembered the day , two years before , when he had sat on his bed redrafting his features with a crayon while awaiting Granacci 's summoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delighted at the changes in himself . He had not only added a couple of inches of height , now standing five feet four , but he had put on some weight . The high bone ridges of his checks no longer seemed skeletal ; and with the growth of his mouth and  | chin it was not so noticeable that his ears were placed too far back on his head . He combed his curly hair forward to cover part of the too broad forehead . His small , heavy-lidded eyes seemed more widely open , their secure expression reflected his having found a place for himself in the world . People need no longer think his face out of plumb . He worshiped beauty in others ; and had so little himself . At thirteen he had reconciled himself to being small , burdened with an insignificant figure . I laving the deepest admiration for the magnificent strength and proportion of the male body , his own mediocre limbs and torso had seemed a tattered cloak . Now he no longer cut so dull a figure . In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , Bertoldo . . . I was just ... " " You fancy yourself in that raiment ? " " I did n't know I could look like this . " " You ca n't . They 're for festa only . " " Is n't Sunday dinner a holiday ? " " Put on this blouse and tunic . Come the Day of the Virgin , you can show ofl . Michelangelo sighed , took off the violet cloak and unlaced the fine yellow linen blouse , then glanced mischievously at his teacher . " Ah well , put not an embroidered crupper on a plow horse . " ' ' hey made their way up the broad staircase from the entresol to the long foyer , then turned sharply to their right into the dining room . He was surprised to find himself in a severe room without a single work of art . The panel frames and lintels were done in gold leaf , the walls in a cool cream color , quiet and restrained . There was a table across the end , seating a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it two more tables formed c l J , seating another dozen inside and out , so that no one was more than a few slender gilt chairs from Lorenzo , and sixty could dine in intimacy . They were early . Michelangelo held back in the doorway . Lorenzo , who h.ul Contessina on his right and a Florentine merchant on his left , saw them . " Ah , Michelangelo , come sit near us . We have no prearranged places ; whoever comes first takes the nearest empty seat . " Contessina put her hand on the chair next to hers , inviting him to join her . As he sat down he noticed the beautiful table settings : square-shaped vrvstal glasses with gold trim , silver plates with the Florentine giglio , lily , inlaid in gold , silver knives , spoons with the Medici crest of six raised balls : three , two and one . As he presented his compliments to Lorenzo , palace pages were removing green plants to reveal the palace orchestra in a shell%lived niche behind him : a harpsichord with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large lute . " Welcome to the palace , Michelangelo , " said Contessina . " Father says you are to be one of the family . Am Ito call you brother ' ? "  | He knew he was being teased , asked himself , " Why was I born with a heavy tongue ? " After a moment he replied : " Perhaps cousin ' would be better ? " Contessina chuckled . " It 's pleasant for me that your first dinner is on a Sunday . Other days women are not permitted at table . We have our meals in the upper loggia . " " Then I am not to see you during the week ? " he blurted out . Her eyes were as round as Giotto 's O. " The palace is not that large . " He watched the colorful array of diners as they entered as though into the court of a king , while the musicians played Un Cavaliere di Spagna : Lorenzo 's daughter Lucrezia and her husband Jacopo Salviati ; Lorenzo 's second cousins Giovanni and Lorenzo de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were orphaned ; Prior Bichiellini , brilliant and bespectacled head of the Augustinian Order at the church of Santo Spirito which housed the libraries of Petrarch and Boccaccio ; Giuliano da Sangallo , who had designed the exquisite villa at Poggio a Caiano ; the Duke of Milan en route to Rome with his retinue ; the ambassador from the Sultan of Turkey ; two cardinals from Spain ; reigning families from Bologna , Ferrara , Arezzo ; scholars from Paris and Berlin bringing manuscripts , treatises , works of art ; members of the Signoria of Florence ; bland , homely Piero Soderini , whom Lorenzo was training to become chief magistrate of Florence ; an emissary from the Doge of Venice ; visiting professors from the university of Bologna ; prosperous city merchants and their wives ; visiting businessmen from Athens , Pekin , Alexandria , London . All came to pay their respects to their host . Contessina kept up a running identification . Here were Demetrius Chalcondyles , head of Lorenzo 's public Academy of Greek and co-publisher of the first printed edition of Homer ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manuscripts who supplied the libraries of the late Pope Nicolas V , Alessandro Sforza , the Earl of Worcester , and the Medici ; the English scholars Thomas Linacre and William Grocyn , who were studying under Poliziano and Chalcondyles of Lorenzo 's Platonic Academy ; Johann Reuchlin , the German humanist and disciple of Pico della Mirandola ; the monk Fra Mariano , for whom Lorenzo had built a monastery outside the Porta San Gallo designed by Giuliano da Sangallo ; an emissary bearing news of the sudden death of Matthias of Hungary , who had admired " the philosopher-prince Lorenzo . " Piero de ' Medici , oldest son of Lorenzo , and his elegantly gowned wife Alfonsina Orsini , came in late and had to take places at the foot of one of the long tables . Michelangelo saw that they were offended . " Piero and Alfonsina do n't approve of all this republicanism , " Contessina whispered . " They think we should hold court , with only Medici allowed at the head table , and the plebeians seated below us. "  | Giovanni , Lorenzo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Giova. with his tonsure fresh-shaved , the eye with the cast involuntarily blinking . II le had his mother 's light brown hair and fair complexion , was tall and corpulent , with a heavy face and plump underchin . Giulio , illegitimate son of Lorenzo 's dead brother , was dark , handsome , saturnine . His eyes slashed through the assemblage , separating every personage and relationship . He missed nothing that could be useful to him . The last to enter was Nannina de ' Medici on the arm of a handsome , brilliantly dressed man . " My aunt Nannina , " murmured Contessina , " and her husband Bernardo Rucellai . He 's a good poet , Father says ; he writes plays . Sometimes the Plato Academy meets in his garden . " Michelangelo 's eyes studied every aspect of this cousin of his mother . He said nothing to Contessina of the relationship . The musicians began to play Corinto , the music of which had been set to one of Lorenzo 's poems . Two servingmen who stood at the lifts began hauling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diners with heavy silver trays of fresh-water fish , Michelangelo was staggered to see a youngish roan in a multicolored shirt pick up a small fish , put it to his ear , then to his - south as though talking to it , and after a moment burst into tears . All eyes were centered on him . Michelangelo turned his perplexed gaze on Contessina . " Jacquo , the palace buffoon . Laugh . Be a Florentine . ' " " Why are you crying , Jacquo ? " asked Lorenzo . " My father was drowned some years ago . I asked this little fish whether he ever saw him anywhere . He said he was too young to have met him and suggested that I ask those bigger fish who may know more about the matter . " Lorenzo , amused , said , " Give Jacquo some of the big fishes so that he may interrogate them . " The laughter had an annealing quality ; strangers at Lorenzo 's table who had never met and perhaps came from diametrically opposed ways of life began talking with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of fun and had been shocked to find a buffoon at Lorenzo 's table , felt his disapproving scowl soften . Contessina had been watching him . " Do n't you like to laugh ? " " I am unpracticed . No one laughs in my house . " " You are what my French tutor calls un homme serieux . But my father is a serious man too ; it 's just that he believes laughter can be useful . You will see when you have lived with us for a time . " The fish dish was removed and he was served with fritto misto . Michelangelo was too fascinated watching Lorenzo as he spoke in turn to some thirty or forty guests to more than taste the food . " Il Magni fzco , does he work through the entire meal ? " " I lc enjoys all these people , the noise and talk and fun . Yet at the same  | time he sits down with a hundred purposes in mind , and rises with them all accomplished . " The servants at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with rosemary in their mouths . Il Cardiere , an improviser upon the lyre , entertained by singing the news and gossip of the week accompanied by satiric comments in rhymed and cadenced verse . After dessert the guests promenaded in the wide foyer . Contessina slipped her arm through his . " Do you know what it means to be a friend ? " she asked . " Granacci has tried to teach me . " " Everyone is a friend to the Medici , " she said quietly , " ... and no one . " 2 . The following morning he and Bertoldo walked through the sentient air ' ; of early spring , the sky a cerulean blue , the stones of Florence fire-gold as 1 ' they absorbed the sun . Above them on the hills of Fiesole each cypress , villa and monastery stood out from the green-gray background of olives and vines . They went to the far end of the garden , to the collection of marble blocks . It was as though they were standing in an ancient cemetery whose tumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to his protege with a shy expression in his pale blue eyes . " Admittedly , I am not a great marble carver . But with you perhaps I can become a great teacher . " 11 " Here 's a beautiful piece of meat , " Michelangelo cried impetuously . Bertoldo smiled at this use of the quarryman 's vernacular . " The figure you want to carve must run with the block . You will know whether you 're going with the grain by the way it chips when you hit it . To see how the veins run , pour water on the block . The tiny black marks , even in good marble , are iron stains . Sometimes they can be chipped off . If you hit an iron vein you will feel feel ibecause it is much harder than marble and it will be your metal on the metal of the stone . " " Makes my teeth grind to think of it . " " Every time you hit the marble with a chisel you mash crystals . A mashed crystal is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn to carve great blocks without crushing the crystals . " " When ? " " Later . " Bertoldo told him about air bubbles , the spots in the marble that fall out or become hollow after weathering . They can not be seen from the outside , and one must learn to know when they are inside . It was like selecting an apple ; one could tell it was wholesome because it bulged forth in healthy  | form into space , while a rotting apple tended to become concave , as if being subdued by space . " Marble is like man : you have to know everything that is in it before you start . If there are concealed air bubbles in you , I 'm wasting my time . " Michelangelo made a childish joke which Bertoldo ignored , going instead for a set of tools from the shed . " Here is a punch . It is a tool to remove . Here are an ugnetto and a scarpello . They are the tools to form . " Bertoldo demonstrated that even when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want he must work with rhythmical strokes so that he achieved circular lines around the block . He was never to complete any one part , but work on all parts , balancing relationships . Did he understand ? " I will , after you turn me loose among these marbles . I learn through my hands , not my ears . " " Then take the wax out ! That Faun was n't too bad , but you arrived at your results through blind intuition . For consistent results you have to know why you are doing what . " The outdoor sculpture workshop was a combination forge , carpenter 's and blacksmith 's shop . There was on hand a supply of beams , wedges , wooden horses , saws , bevels , hammers , wood chisels to repair the handles of hammers . The floor was cement to allow for solid footing . Standing alongside the forge were newly arrived rods of Swedish iron that Granacci had bought the day before so that Michelangelo could make himself a full set of nine chisels . Bertoldo told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the best charcoal and produced a slow , intense , even heat . " I already know how to temper tools for pietra serena , " said Michelangelo . " The Topolinos taught me . " With the fire started , he reached for the blower , an enclosed wheel with - Metal slabs about its circumference , to feed it a good draft . " Basta , " exclaimed Bertoldo . " Tap these iron rods together and see if t hey ring like bells . " The rods were good grade iron , all except one , which was discarded . When the fire was hot enough he became immersed in making his first set of tools . He knew that " the man who does not make his own tools does not make his own sculpture . " The hours passed . They did not stop for dinner . I ) usk was falling when the old man became faint , his skin ashen gray . He would have fallen if Michelangelo had not caught him in his arms . He carried him to the casino , marveling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rod of Swedish ore . He put his teacher down gently on a chair . " ' low could I have let you work so long ? " he groaned . A little color spread over the brittle bones of Bertoldo 's cheeks . " It is not enough to handle marble ; you must also have iron in your blood . " The next morning Michelangelo rose in the dark , quietly so that he would  | not waken Bertoldo , walked through the sleeping streets in order to be in the garden at dawn . He knew that it was the first rays of the sun that revealed the truth about marble . Under these piercing rays marble was almost translucent ; all veins , faults , hollows were mercilessly exposed . Quality that could survive the earliest sun would be intact when night fell . He went from block to block tapping with his hammer . The solid blocks gave out a bell-like sound , the defective ones a dull thud . One small piece that had been exposed to the weather for a long time had developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away the membranous coating to get to the pure milky substance below . Wanting to learn the direction of the vein , he held his hammer tightly and fractured off the high corners . He liked what he saw ; took a piece of charcoal and drew the head and beard of an old man on the marble . Then he pulled up a bench , straddled the block , gripping it with both knees , picked up hammer and chisel . His body settled down with a soughing movement . Tensions within him fell away with each falling chip . Stone filled him out , gave him body ; he felt implemented and whole . His arm grew lighter and stronger with the passing of the hours . These metal tools clothed him in their own armor . They made him robust . He thought , " As Torrigiani loves the feel of a gun in his hand , Sansovino the plow , Rustici the rough coat of a dog , and Baccio a woman , just so am I happiest with a block of marble between my legs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marble was the heart of the universe , the purest substance created by God ; not merely a symbol of God but a portrait , God 's way of manifesting Himself . Only a divine hand could create such noble beauty . He felt himself a part of the white purity before him , felt its integrity as though it were his own . He remembered Bertoldo quoting Donatello : " Sculpture is an art which , by removing all that is superfluous from the material under treatment , reduces it to that form designed in the artist 's mind . " Was it not equally true that the sculptor could never force any design on the marble which was not indigenous to its own nature ? He had the impression that , no matter how honestly a sculptor designed , it would come to nothing if it did not agree with the basic nature of the block . In this sense a sculptor could never be completely master of his fate , as a painter could be . Paint was fluid , it could bend around corners . Marble was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigorous discipline of a partnership . The marble and he were one . They spoke to each other . And for him , the feel of marble was the supreme sensation . No gratification of any other sense , taste , sight , sound , smell , could approach it . He had removed the outer shell . Now he dug into the mass , entered iii the biblical sense . In this act of creation there was needed the thrust , the penetration , the beating and pulsating upward to a mighty climax , the total  | possession . It was not merely an act of love , it was the act of love : the mating of his own inner patterns to the inherent forms of the marble ; an insemination in which he planted seed , created the living work of art . Bertoldo entered the shop , saw Michelangelo at work , cried out , " No , no , that 's wrong . Stop ! That 's the amateur way to carve . " Michelangelo heard the voice over the pounding of his hammer , turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his Irgrretto . " Michelangelo ! You 're beginning at the wrong end . " Michelangelo did not hear him . Bertoldo turned away from the sight of his apprentice cutting a furrow through the stone as though it were quince jelly . Ile shook his head in amused despair . " As well try to keep Vesuvius from erupting . " 3. ' f iat evening he bathed in a tub of hot water placed for him in a small room at the end of his hallway , put on a dark blue shirt and hose and accompanied Bertoldo to Lorenzo 's studiolo for supper . He was nervous . What would he say ? The Plato Academy was reported to be the intellectual heart of Europe , a university and a printing press , a fount of literature and a worldexploring expedition which had for its purpose the turning of Florence into a second Athens . If only he had listened to Urbino when his teacher had been reading from the old Greek manuscripts . ' there was a fire crackling in the hearth , warm light in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant air of camaraderie . Seven chairs were drawn up to a low table . The shelves of books , Greek reliefs , cases of atncos and amulets made the room intimate and cozy . The Plato group received him casually , then returned to their discussion of the comparative worth of medicine and astrology as sciences , giving Michelangelo an opportunity to sort out the faces and personalities of the four scholars who were reputed to be the outstanding brains of Italy . Marsilio Ficino , fifty-seven , had founded the Plato Academy for Cosimo , . orcnzo 's grandfather . He was a tiny man , under five feet , and though suffering the continuing ills of the hypochondriac he had translated all of Plato and become a living dictionary of ancient philosophies by translating the body of Egyptian wisdom before devouring the work of the sages from At istotic through the AIexandrians , Confucianists , Zoroastrians . Trained by his father to be a doctor , he was well acquainted with the natural sciences as well . Ile had helped introduce the printing of books in Florence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to listen to his lectures . In his beautiful villa in Careggi , which Cosimo had had Michelozzo design for him , and which was managed by his nieces , he burned an  | undying lamp in front of a statue of Plato , whom he was trying to have canonized as the " dearest of Christ 's disciples , " an act of heresy as well as inverted history for which Rome had very nearly excommunicated him . His nieces quipped : " He can recite the whole of a Plato dialogue but he can never remember where he left his slippers. " lil Michelangelo next turned his ' attention to Cristoforo Landino , about sixtysix , tutor of Lorenzo 's father , Piero the Gouty , and of Lorenzo himself , brilliant writer and lecturer , training the Florentine mind to free itself from dogma and to apply the findings of science to nature . He had served as confidential secretary to the Signoria , was experienced in politics , and a leader of the Medici circle for three generations . He was the Dante authority , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comedy printed in Florence . His lifetime work centered around the Italian language , the volgare , which almost singlehanded he was turning from a despised argot into a respected language by translating into it Pliny , Horace , Virgil . He was known in Florence for his revolutionary credo : " The deepest basis for action is the clear supremacy of contemplation and knowledge . " In Lorenzo he had found the hero of Plato 's Republic : " The ideal ruler of a city is the scholar . " Perched on the edge of a stiff leather chair was Angelo Poliziano , thirtysix years of age , who was said by opponents of the Medici to be kept close at hand because by contrast he made Lorenzo appear attractive . Yet he was acknowledged to be the most fantastic scholar there : publishing in Latin at the age of ten , invited into the Florentine Cornpagnia di Dottrina at twelve to be trained by Ficino , Landino and the Greek scholars brought to Florence by the Medici . He had translated the first books of Homer 's Iliad by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become tutor to his sons . One of the ugliest of men , he was possessed of as lucid and limpid a style as any poet since Petrarch ; his Stanze per la Giostra di Giuliano , II a book-length poem celebrating the tournament of Giuliano de ' Medici , Lorenzo 's younger brother , killed by the Pazzi , had become a model for Italian poetry . Michelangelo 's eyes now went to the youngest and most attractive of the group , twenty-seven-year-old Pico della Mirandola , who read and wrote in twenty-two languages . The other members of the group teased him by saying , " The only reason Pico does n't know a twenty-third is that he ca n't find one . " Known as the " great lord of Italy , " with a sweet and sincere nature , unspoiled by his soft golden hair , deep blue eyes , flawless blond skin , slender figure , Florentines called him " beautiful and beloved . " His intellectual concept was the unity of knowledge ; his ambition , to reconcile all religions and philosophies since the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his mind the totality of human learning . To this end he read Chinese philosophers in Chinese , Arabic in Arabic , Hebrew in 1 , I c.  | brew , believing that all languages were rational divisions of one universal language . Of all Italians the most divinely gifted , he yet made no enemies , even as ugly Poliziano could make no friends . The door opened . Lorenzo entered , limping from an attack of his recurrent gout . He nodded to the others , turned to Michelangelo . " This is the sancta sanctorum : most of what Florence learns is started in this room . When we are in the palace , and you are free , join us . " Lorenzo moved an ornamented screen and knocked on the dumb-waiter behind , from which Michelangelo assumed that the studiolo was directly below the dining room . He heard the platform moving inside the shaft , and within a few moments the academicians were taking plates of cheese , fruit , bread , honey , nuts and setting them on the low table in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; nor was there anything but milk to drink . Though the talk was light , Michelangelo perceived that the group met for work ; and after supper " wine made the hair swell . " The table was cleared , the plates , fruit rinds and nutshells dispatched down the lift . At once the conversation became serious . Sitting on a low stool beside Bertoldo , Michelangelo heard the case against the Church , which the scholars in this room no longer considered synonymous with their religion . Florence in particular was a seat of disaffection because Lorenzo and the majority of his fellow townsmen agreed that Pope Sixtus of Rome had been behind the Pazzi conspiracy which had resulted in the murder of Giuliano and the almost fatal stabbing of Lorenzo . The Pope had excommunicated Florence , forbidding the clergy to fulfill the duties of their office . ! Florence in turn had excommunicated the Pope , declaring the papal claims to power were based on such eighth-century forgeries as the Donation of Constantine . The Pope in an effort to crush Lorenzo had sent troops into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neighboring town of Poggibonsi ... . With the advent of Innocent VIII in 1484 , peace had been re-established between Florence and Rome ; but as Michelangelo heard the evidence summarized by the men around the table , it appeared that much of the Tuscan clergy had become increasingly immoral in personal conduct as well as in clerical practice . The outstanding exception was the Augustinian Order at Santo Spirito , living in flawless self-discipline under Prior Bichiellini . Pico della MirandoIa put his elbows on the low table , resting his chin on his clasped hands . " I think I may have come upon an answer to our dilemma over the ( : lunch : in the form of a Dominican monk from Ferrara . I 've heard him breach there . He shakes the ribs of the cathedral . " 1 , andino , whose white hair was worn long in back , with tufts coming over his forehead , leaned across the table , so that Michelangelo could see the fine network of wrinkles circling his eyes . " ' This monk , is lie all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " replied Pico , " he 's a brilliant student of the Bible and St. Augustine . He feels even more strongly about the corruption of the clergy than we do . " Angelo Poliziano , of the heavy features and coarse black hair worn stringlike down over his ears and covering part of the rough skin , moistened his overly red , projecting underlip . " It 's not only the corruption , it 's the ignorance that appalls me . " Ficino , light-conplected , with a bright , perceptive face and tiny nose and mouth , cried out eagerly : " It 's been a long time since we 've had a scholar in a Florentine pulpit . We have only Fra Mariano and Prior Bichiellini . " " Girolamo Savonarola has given himself over to years of study , " Pico assured them . " Plato and Aristotle as well as Church doctrine . " " What are his ambitions ? " asked Lorenzo . " To purify the Church . " " Nothing more ? What about power ? " " Only the power within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ... " proffered Lorenzo . " If Your Excellency will request his transfer of the Lombard Fathers ? " " I 'll attend to it . " The subject settled , the oldest , Landino , and the youngest , Pico , now turned their attention to Michelangelo . Landino asked if he had read what Pliny wrote about the famous Greek statue of the Laocoon . " I know nothing of Pliny. " li " Then I shall read it to you . " He took a book down from the shelf , quickly thumbed through it and read the story of the statue in the palace of Emperor Titus , " a work that may be looked upon as preferable to any other production of the art of 1 11 painting or of statuary . It is sculptured from a single block , both the main figures as well as the children , and the serpents with their marvelous folds . " hl Poliziano followed with a description of the Venus of Cnidos from Lucian , which represented Venus standing before Paris when he awarded her ih the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statue at the tomb of Xenophon. iII Michelangelo will wan t to read Pausanias in tho original , " said Pico . I I , 1 will bring you my manuscript . " " I do n't read Greek , " said Michelangelo a bit ashamedly . " I will teach you . " " I do not have the gift for languages . " " No matter , " interceded Poliziano , " in a year you will be writing sonnets in Latin as well as Greek . " To himself , Michelangelo murmured , " Permit me to doubt . " But it would be bad manners to kill the enthusiasm of these new friends who were now 6I arguing among themselves as to which books he should be taught from .  | " ... Homer . For Greek , he is the purest . " " Aristophanes is more fun . To laugh while learning ... " Ile was relieved when the group turned its attention away from him . The most important idea he gleaned from the swift , learned talk was that religion and knowledge could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : urd Rome , before the dawn of Christianity , had built gloriously in the arts , humanities , sciences , philosophy . Then for a thousand years all such wisdom and beauty had been crushed , declared anathema , buried in darkness . Now this little group of men , the sensual Poliziano , the lined Landino , the tiny hicino , the golden-haired Pico della Mirandola , these few fragile men , led and aided by Lorenzo de ' Medici , were attempting to create a new intellect under the banner of a word Michelangelo had never heard before : I humanism . What did it mean ? As the hours wore on he found himself caught up in interest . So much u , that when Bertoldo signaled that he was leaving , slipping out quietly , ' Michelangelo remained . And as each of the Platonists poured out his thoughts he slowly gathered the sense of what they meant : We are giving the world back to man , and man back to himself . Man shall no longer be vile , but noble . We shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Without a free , vigorous and creative mind , man is but an animal , and he will die like an animal , without any shred of a soul . We return to man his arts , his literature , his sciences , his independence to think and feel as an individual , not to be bound to dogma like a slave , to rot in he , chains . At the end of the evening when he returned to his room and found Ncrtoldo still awake , he blurted out : " ' They make me feel so stupid . " " ' They are the best minds in Europe . They can give you heroic themes to ponder on . " Then to console the tired youth , he added , " But they can not carve marble , and that is a language as eloquent as any . " The next morning he reached the garden early . Torrigiani sought him out iii the workshed where he had set up his bearded old man to practice on . " 1 'm consumed by curiosity , " cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Michelangelo told his friend of the room he shared with Bertoldo , how in had wandered down the long halls , free to handle the art treasures , of the guests at the Sunday dinner and his exciting supper in Lorenzo 's strnliolo with the Platonists . Torrigiani was interested only in personalities . " What are Poliziano and Pico della Mirandola like ? " " Well , Poliziano is ugly until he starts to speak , then his words make brut hc:nitiftil . Pico della Mirandola is the best-looking man I 've ever seen , trod lailli , int . "  | * Palm Sunday was a warm spring day . On his washstand he found three gold florins which Bertoldo said would be left for him each week by Lorenzo 's secretary , Ser Piero da Bibbiena . He could not resist the temptation of showing off to his family . On his bed he laid out another new outfit , the white blouse embroidered with grapes and leaves , the short surcoat with cape sleeves belted in front with silver buckles , the wine-colored stockings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he met him in the Piazza San Marco so they could walk home together . Rustici stared at him as he came down the path and , when Michelangelo was close enough , mimicked : " I 'm plain . " Then , more acidly , " Spread your tail . " " My tail ? " " All peacocks have colorful tails . " " Oh , now , Rustici , " he wailed , " ca n't I wear them even once ? " " Ca n't I wear this jewelry just once ? Ca n't I drink this rare wine just once ? Order these servants around just once ? Squander some gold coins just once ? Sleep with this pretty girl just once ? ... " " All the temptations of the flesh in one sonnet . Truly , Rustici , I feel as though I were dressed up in a costume for a pageant . But I would like to impress my family . " " Val via , " growled Rustici . " Go your way . "  | Torrigiani came stalking down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black velvet hat flying . He hauled up short in front of Michelangelo . " I want to talk to you , alone . " Torrigiani seized his arm . Michelangelo held back . " Why alone ? We have no secrets . " We shared confidences . Until you moved into the palace and became so important . " There was no mistaking the emotion behind Torrigiani 's outburst . Michelangelo spoke gently , hoping to placate him . " But you live in your own palace , Torrigiani . " " Yes , and I do n't have to play cheap little tricks like knocking out a faun 's teeth to ingratiate myself with the Medici . " " You sound jealous . " " Of what ! Of an insufferable prig ? " " Why a prig ? What 's the connection ? " " Because you know nothing about happiness or comradeship . " " I 've never been happier . " " Yes , setting down charcoal lines with your grimy hands . " " But good charcoal lines , " protested Michelangelo , refusing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face . " Are you implying that mine are not ? " " Why do you always bring a discussion back to yourself ? You 're not the renter of the universe . " " ' 1'o myself , I am . And I was to you too , until your head got swollen . " Michelangelo stared at him in amazement . " You were never the center of my universe . " ? " Then you deceived me . You 're sucking up for your commissions an awl nl long time in advance . " The sun went cold on Michelangelo 's face . He turned and ran as hard as he could , out of the garden and down the Street of the Cuirass Makers . The carpenter and grocer sitting in the sun before their shops pulled at their caps respectfully ; otherwise his new clothes were no more of a success ut home than they had been with Rustici . His father felt hurt , as though the finery was in some way a reproach to him . Michelangelo took the three gold florins from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's desk . Lodovico gazed at them without comment , but his stepmother Lucrezia bussed him happily on both cheeks , her eyes blight with excitement . " Now tell me ! What sauces do they use on the pasta ? " Michelangelo racked his brains , wanting to please . " 1 ca n't remember . "  | " Then the meats . Do the palace cooks use zedoary ? What of their famous sole cooked with banana strips and pine nuts ? " " Forgive me , madre mia , I do n't know . " She shook her head in despair . " Do n't you remember what you chew ? Then make friends with the cooks . Write down the recipes for my sake . " Now the full family had assembled in Lodovico 's combination office and sitting room . His grandmother was happy because he was meeting the great men of Florence . His brother Giovansimone was interested in the parties . Il , f His aunt and uncle were pleased because of the gold coins he had brought home . Buonarroto wanted to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold coins every week ? Were the stone and materials taken out of his salary ? His father called for attention . " How do the Medici treat you ? Il Magnifico ? " " Well . " " Piero ? " " He is arrogant ; it is his nature . " " Giovanni , the cardinal-to-be ? " *  | on his brother Francesco . " A gift is a whim . Next week there may be nothing ! " Michelangelo thought his father was going to throw the money at his head . He had meant only to bring home his earnings like a dutiful son .. . perhaps bragging a little . But the three gold florins were more than Lodovico would earn in months at the customs . Michelangelo realized that he had been indelicate , for now , with his head on his chest , Lodovico commented , " ' Think how many millions of florins the Medici must have if they can give a fifteen-year-old student three of them each week . " Then , with a quick movement of his hand , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucrezia seized the moment to summon them to table . After dinner the family reassembled in the sitting room . Lionardo , silent during the earlier discussion , placed himself in front of Michelangelo to proclaim in a pontifiral voice : " Art is a vice . " " Art , a vice ! " Michelangelo was amazed at his brother . " How . . . why ? " " Because it is self-indulgence , concentration on your own lust to create instead of contemplating the glories of what God has created . " " But , Lionardo , our churches are plastered with art . " " We have been led astray by the devil . A church is not a fair ; people nccrst go to pray on their knees , not to see a play painted on the walls . " " ' Then there is no place for a sculptor in your world ? " I ionardo clasped his hands , gazing devoutly through the ceiling . " My world is the next world , where we will sit at the right hand of God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Now I have two fanatics on my hands . " Ile left for his midday nap , followed by the rest of the family . Only Molina Alessandra remained sitting quietly in a corner . Michelangelo too wanted to leave ; he was feeling tired . The whole day had been a disappointment . I , ionardo would not let him go . He moved into a frontal attack on Loicnro and the Plato Academy as pagans , atheists , enemies of the Church , ant ic'hrists. " 1 promise you , Lionardo , " began Michelangelo placatingly , " I have heard no sacrilege , irreverence , at least not to religion itself . Only to the abuses . ( , mcnzo is a reformer ; he wants to cleanse the Church . " " Cleanse ! A word that infidels use when they mean destroy . An attack on the Church is an attack on Christianity . " Now in a high rage Lionardo accused Lorenzo de ' Medici of carnality , dchanc-hcry , of leaving the palace at midnight to ride out with his cronies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t ) t these charges , I know nothing , " said Michelangelo quietly , " but he is ct Ulowcr . SlumId he not love ? "  | " He was a philanderer before the death of his wife . It is common knowledge . His lust has already enfeebled his body . " Fle wondered how his brother came into possession of such charges . He did not think of Lorenzo as a saint ; he had heard him say laughingly to Landino , " I do not err through wickedness , but rather through some part of my nature that loves pleasure , " and he remembered Lorenzo 's reply to Ficino , " I can not regret that I love the pleasures of the flesh ; for the love of painting , sculpture and literature are also sensual in nature . " All this seemed to him to be the private affair of a virile , effective man . " Only a toady like yourself would be unable to see that Lorenzo is a tyrant , " continued Lionardo . Michelangelo thought , " This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He became increasingly miserable , his clothes felt tight and ridiculous . " He has destroyed the freedom of Florence , " cried Lionardo . " He has made things soft and easy for the people . He gives them bread and circuses . ... The only reason he has failed to take a crown and become king is that he is too devious ; he likes to work behind the scenes , controlling every move while the Tuscans are reduced to pawns ... " Before Michelangelo could reply , Molina Alessandra said , " Yes , Lionardo , he is softening us . He has kept us from civil war ! For years we destroyed each other , family against family , neighborhood against neighborhood , with blood flowing in the streets . Now we are a unified people . Only the Medici can keep us from each other 's throats . " Lionardo refused to answer his grandmother . " Michelangelo , I wish one last word with you . " Michelangelo faced his brother across a heavy mahogany table . IIe had never been able to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " This is my farewell to you . I leave the house tonight , to join Girolaino Savonarola in San Marco . " " Then Savonarola has arrived ? Lorenzo invited him . I was in the studiolo when Pico della Mirandola suggested it , and Lorenzo agreed to write to Lombardy . " " A Medici lie ! Why should Lorenzo summon him , when it is Savonarola 's intention to destroy the Medici ? I leave this house as Fra Savonarola left his family in Ferrara : with only a shirt on my back . Forever . I shall pray for you on the floor of my cell until there is no skin left on my knees and the blood comes . Perhaps in that blood you can be redeemed . " Michelangelo could see from Lionardo 's burning eyes that there was no use in answering . He shook his head in mock despair , thought : " Father is right . How did this sane , sensible , money-changing Buonarroti family , who have had nothing but conformists for two hundred years , hatch two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lionardo , " We shall not be too far apart , only a few hundred feet across the Piazza San Marco . If you lean out the window of your monastery cell you will hear me cutting stone in the garden . " 5 ? ice following week , when he again found three gold coins on his washstand , he decided not to take them home . He went looking for Contessina , found her in the library . " I must buy a gift . " " For a lady ? " " For a woman . " " Jewels , perhaps ? " " No . " Sullenly . " She is the mother of my friends , the stonecutters . " " I low about a linen tablecloth bordered with openwork ? " " ' I'hey have a tablecloth . " " I las she many dresses ? " " The one she was married in . " " A black dress for mass , then ? " " I , xcellent. " " 1 low big is she ? " 1 lc looked bewildered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinned . " With a pen I know everything : even a woman 's proportions . " " I will ask my nurse to take me to the shop to buy a length of black wool . My sarta will cut it to fit your drawing . " " You are kind , Contessina . " She wanted no gratitude . " It is nothing . " I Ic went to the outdoor market in the Piazza Santo Spirito and puri Used gifts for the other Topolinos , then arranged with one of the grooms in the basement of the palace to borrow a horse and saddlebag . Sunday morning after attending mass in the palace chapel he packed the bag and sc  --  t out for Settignano , with the sun burning warmly on his bare head . At fiat he had thought he would change to his old clothes so that the Topolinos would not think he was putting on airs , but quickly realized that this would be in affectation . Besides he fancied himself in the dark blue shirt and hose which he was already wearing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Ihm , n ; urroti house on the ridge opposite , enjoying their weekly hour of idleness after returning from mass in the little village church . They were so surptiscd to see him come riding up the road on a silver-gray stallion , sitting on a silver saddle , that they forgot to say hello . Michelangelo too was silent . l lc got down from the horse , tied him to a tree , took off the saddlebag and  | emptied it onto the rough board table . After a moment of silence the father asked what the packages were . Michelangelo replied : " Gifts . " " Gifts ? " The father gazed at his three sons in turn , for except to children , Tuscans do not give presents . " Are you late for the last Befana , or early for the next ? " " Both . For four years I ate your bread and drank your wine . " The father replied roughly , " You cut stone for your soup . " " I took my first money home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring the second . " " You have a commission ! " cried the grandfather . " No . Each week Lorenzo gives me spending money . " The Topolinos scrutinized one another 's faces . " Spending money ? " asked the father . " You mean wages . " " I receive no wages . " " Oh , it is keep money : for your room and food ? " " I do not pay for room and food . " " It is purchase money ? For your calze , or for marble ? " " Everything is provided . " " Then what is it for ? " " To spend on whatever comes to mind . " " If you have food , bed , marble , what would come to mind ? " " Pleasure . " " Pleasure ? " The family rolled this word on their tongues as though it were a new fruit . " What manner of pleasure ? " Michelangelo thought about that . " Well , gambling at seed cards , for example . " " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " After a moment : " To be shaved in the straw market . " " Do you have a beard ? " " Not yet . But I could have oil put in my hair like Torrigiani does . " " Do you want oil in your hair ? " " No . " " Then it is not a pleasure . What other ? " In desperation : " Well , the women who wear a cowl with a bell on their heads when they walk on Saturday afternoons . " " Do you want these women ? " " I use it as an illustration . I could buy candles to burn before the Virgin . " " That is a duty . " " A glass of wine of a Sunday afternoon ? " " That is a custom . " He walked to the table . " It is to bring things to your friends . "  | Slowly , amidst a deep silence , he began distributing his gifts . " To min madre , for mass . For Bruno , a leather belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stockings . A nonno , a wool scarf for your throat in winter . For Father Topolino , high boots for when you work in Cave Maiano . Enrico , you said that when you grew up you would own a gold ring . Eccolo . " For a long moment they gazed at him , speechless . Then the mother went into the house to put on the dress ; the father pulled on the high boots ; Bruno clasped the belt about his waist ; Gilberto donned the new gold shirt ; the grandfather stood wrapping and unwrapping the soft wool scarf around his neck . Enrico mounted the horse , the better to admire his ring iu privacy . Then the father spoke . " All of these . . . these gifts : they are from spending money ? " " All . " " And Lorenzo , he gives you this money to buy us gifts . " " Yes . " " He is truly The Magnificent One . " Michelangelo noticed another package on the table . Perplexed , he opened it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " How about a linen tablecloth ? " Contessina had put this gift in the saddlebag as her contribution . The color rose to his cheeks . Dio mio ! How could he explain it ? He thrust the cloth into the hands of Mother Topolino . " This is a gift from Contessina de ' Medici . For you . " The Topolinos were stupefied . " Contessina de ' Medici ! How would she send us a tablecloth ? She does not know we live . " " Yes , she does . I told her about you . Her sarta sewed your dress . " The nonno crossed himself . " It is a miracle . " Michelangelo thought , " Amen . It is true . " Each of the Plato Four had his own villa in the country around Florence . They came in several times a week to lecture and work with Lorenzo in the studiolo . Lorenzo seemed eager that Michelangelo take advantage of these opportunities , and so he attended faithfully . The Platonists tried to interest him in Latin and Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the two languages was a drawing similar in nature to his figure drawing . He took their manuscripts and assignments to his room , pored over them for hours . . . and learned little . " Nothing sticks ! " he wailed to Bertoldo . Stopped , the men taught him to read aloud , poetry in the vulgate : Dante ,  | Petrarch , Horace , Virgil . This he enjoyed , particularly the discussions that followed his reading of The Divine Comedy , with the interpretation of its philosophy . The Platonists complimented him on his growing clarity of diction , then brought in Girolamo Benivieni , whom they described as " the most fervent partisan of poetry in the volgare , " to teach Michelangelo how to write his own verse . When he demurred on the grounds that he wanted to become a sculptor , not a poet , Pico said : " The structure of a sonnet is as rigorous a discipline as the structure of a marble relief . When Benivieni teaches you to write sonnets he trains your mind in the rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take advantage of his talent ! " Landino reassured him , " We will not try to weaken your carving arm by replacing hammer and chisel with pen and ink ! " Poliziano added , " You must not give up studying poetry . You must continue to read aloud . To be a complete artist it is not enough to be a painter , sculptor or architect . One must also be a poet , if one is to attain full expression . " " I do so poorly , " Michelangelo complained one night to Benivieni when he had tried to make the lines scan ; " how can you bear to read my clumsy attempts ? " Benivieni , also a talented musician , clucked at Michelangelo 's despair , sang a gay song of his own composition , then replied , " My early efforts were no better ; worse , if anything . You will think you are a bad poet until the day comes when you have a need to express something ; then you 'll have the tools of poetry at hand , meter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your workbench . " On religious holidays when Lorenzo closed the garden , Michelangelo would ride horseback to Landino 's villa on the hill in the Casentino , which had been given to him by the Florentine Republic for his commentaries on Dante ; to Ficino 's villa at Careggi , a castle with battlements and covered galleries ; to Pico 's The Oak or Poliziano 's Villa Diana , both on the slopes of Fiesole . At the Villa Diana they would settle down in a garden pavilion like the one in which the characters from Boccaccio 's Decameron spun their tales , and listen to Poliziano read his newest poem : Come where green the grass is , Green the trees are turning . Have no fear , fair lasses , Every lad is yearning ; Beasts and birds are burning All with love the May ... . Youth 's a brittle jewel . Grass again is greening , Age knows no renewal . Fair ones , be not cruel To your loves the May .  | An idea began to shape in Michelangelo 's mind : he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diana , with a sculpture workshop and an annual stipend from Lorenzo which would enable him to buy Carrara marbles tram which to carve great statues . Was there any reason why he should not be so treated ? He was in no hurry , but when Lorenzo did give him one he would like it to be in Settignano , among stonecarvers . The days and the weeks passed , drawing from live models , transferring the figures to clay , experimenting with scraps of stone to bring forth a knee joint , a hip movement , the turn of a head on its neck , learning how to avoid a welt when the point of his punch broke , studying Lorenzo 's Greek sculptures for techniques . Lorenzo also pushed his education . One Sunday morning he asked Michelangelo to accompany the Medici family to the church of San Gallo where they would hear Fra Mariano , to whose cloister Lorenzo went when he wanted a serious discussion on theology . " Fra Mariano is my ideal , " said Lorenzo , " he has graceful austerity , elegant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You will hear . " Era Mariano preached in a mellow voice , harmonious cadences and apt words . He complimented Christianity on its resemblance to Platonism , quoted from the Greeks , declaimed lines from the Latin poets with polished eloquence . Michelangelo was captivated ; he had not heard this manner of priest before . When Fra Mariano modulated his voice he was charmed ; when Mariano unfolded his argument he was convinced ; when Mariano illustrated with a funny anecdote he smiled ; when he pressed with serious tncths he yielded to their force . To Lorenzo he said , " I understand better now what the Academy means by modern religion . " One of Piero 's grooms knocked on the door of his apartment and entered . " His Excellency , Piero de ' Medici , commands Michelangelo Buonarroti to present himself in His Excellency 's anteroom at the hour before sunset . " Michelangelo thought , " How different from his father , who asks if it would give me pleasure to join him . " To the groom he replied courteously , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was ample time for a soak in a round wooden tub in the bathing closet at the end of the hall , sitting with his knees clasped under his chin , wondering what the crown prince of the Medici dynasty , who had never favored him with anything more than a formal bow , could want of him . Some instinct told him that his peacock outfit of embroidered shirt and violet clock was precisely what Piero would approve . Piero 's suite was on the first floor of the palace , just over the open loggia is the corner of the Via de ' Gori and Via Larga . Michelangelo had never been ice this wing of the palace , not even to see the art works he had heard discussed , because of Piero 's coolness . Now his feet dragged along the corridor leading to Piero 's suite , for on the walls there was a brilliant painting  | by Fra Angelico and a delicate marble relief by Desiderio da Settignano . The groom was waiting outside Piero 's anteroom . He admitted Michelangelo . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray damask embroidered with jewels , was sitting motionless in a high-backed purple throne chair . Covering the wall behind was a tapestry of leaves and flowers , and on the wall to her left , a large oil portrait of her , the cheeks a pale alabaster . Piero pretended he had not heard Michelangelo enter . He stood on a multicolored Persian carpet with his back to his guest , studying a bone tabernacle with glass panels , inside which were painted stories of Christ . Alfonsina stared at Michelangelo imperiously , giving no sign of recognition tion but sniffing slightly as she always did , as though Florence and the Florentines smelled bad . She had from the beginning made no attempt to I ! II conceal her contempt for the Florentines . To the Tuscans , who had hated Rome and everything Roman for centuries , this was infuriating . And Piero de ' Medici , half Orsini by inheritance , was now having the other half of his heritage usurped by this second Orsini . Piero wheeled around , his long thick hair waving down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the chin . Without any formal greeting he announced : " We instruct you , Michelangelo Buonarroti , that we wish Madonna 11 Alfonsina 's portrait sculptured in marble . " " Thank you , Excellency , " replied Michelangelo , " but I can not carve portraits . " " Why not ? " Michelangelo attempted to explain that his purpose was not to create any one person . " I could not capture a likeness , as this painter has , that would satisfy you . " I " l " Twaddle ! I order you to carve my wife in marble ! " Michelangelo gazed at Piero 's contemptuous expression , heard his father 's voice saying , " What is it , to be a stonecutter in the Medici palace ? The same as a groom . " Madonna Alfonsina spoke for the first time . " Kindly remove this discussion to your own room . " Piero angrily opened a door and stalked through . Michelangelo surmised that he had best follow . He closed the door behind him and was surprised to find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won in tournaments , were many fine works of art : Botticelli 's Pallas , Bertoldo 's Bellcrophon , and in niches , ancient painted wood sculptures against a golden ground . Involuntarily he exclaimed : " Your Excellency has superb taste in the arts . " Piero was not propitiated . " When I want your opinion I will ask for it . In the meanwhile you will explain why you think you are better than any other of our hirelings. "  | Michelangelo clenched his anger with his back teeth , forcing himself to reply politely . " I am a sculptor . Resident in this palace at your father 's request . " " We have a hundred tradesmen living off this palace . What they are told to do , they do . You will commence tomorrow morning . And see that you make Her Excellency into a beautiful statue . " " Not even Mino da Fiesole could do that . " Piero 's eyes flashed . " You . . . you . . . contadino ! Pack your rags and get out of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing clothing from the chest onto the bed . There was a knock . Contessina entered with her nurse . " I hear you have been feuding with my brother . " IIe leaned down to take something from the bottom of the chest . " Stand up here and talk to me ! " Imperiously . He rose , went close to her . " I have nothing to say . " " Is it true that you refused to carve Alfonsina 's portrait ? " " I refused . " " Would you refuse if my father asked you to do his portrait ? " Michelangelo was silent . Would he refuse Lorenzo , for whom he felt so deep an affection ? " Would you refuse if I asked ? " Again he was trapped . " Piero did not ask me , " he replied quietly . " He ordered me . " There were hurried footsteps in the corridor . Lorenzo came into the room , his skin unusually dark , his eyes snapping . The nurse stammered : " Excellency . . . I tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I will not have this happen in my home . " Michelangelo 's eyes blazed . " I asked your father to cede you to me , did I not ? " " Yes . " " Then I am responsible for you . " " I have no apologies to offer . " " I am not asking for apologies . You came in here as one of the family . No one will treat you as . . . as an entertainer . . . or order you out of your own home . " Michelangelo 's knees went weak . He sat down on his bed . Lorenzo spoke more gently . " But you , too , have much to learn ... " " Admitted . My manners ... " " ... that you do not rush back here every time you are offended , and start packing your possessions . That is poor loyalty to me . Is that under-stood ? "  | Michelangelo rose , trying to hold back the tears . " I owe Piero an apology . I said something unkind about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . What you wish to say to him in return is your own business . " Contessina lagged behind to whisper over her shoulder : " Make it up with Piero . He can cause a lot of trouble . " 7 ? The time had arrived to try a theme . What was a theme ? And which themes interested him ? " It must be a Greek theme , " decreed the Plato Four . " It should come out of the legends : Hercules and Antaeus , the Battle of Amazons , the Trojan War , " proffered Poliziano , with particles of cantaloupe clinging to his enormous dark lips . " It would be in the mood of the frieze on the Parthenon at Athens . " Michelangelo said , " But I know little of such matters . " Landino , his face grave , replied : " That , my dear Michelangelo , is what we have been trying to suggest for the past months : that as your ex officio tutors we teach you about the Greek world and its culture . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the music of violas and clavichords . " What I think our friends are trying to say is that they would like to guide you back to the golden age of paganism . " They told him stories of the twelve tasks of Hercules , Niobe suffering for her dying children , of the Athenian Minerva , the Dying Gladiator . Lorenzo moderated the discussion in his slightly unpleasant voice . " Do not issue edicts to our young friend . He must come to a theme of his own free will . " Michelangelo pulled back into his seat and sat with his head resting on the back of the chair , his eyes gleaming amber in the candlelight that brought whorls of red to his chestnut hair . He listened to his own voices . One thing he knew for certain : his first theme could not come from Athens or Cairo or Rome or even Florence . It had to come from him , something he knew and felt and understood . Otherwise he would be lost . A work of art was not like a work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be born within . Lorenzo had asked , " What do you want to say ? " To himself he replied , " Something simple , about which I can feel deeply . But what do I know ? Even about myself ? That I want to become a sculptor , and that I love marble ? I can carve no sculpture out of these sentiments . " Then , against the murmur of voices , he saw himself standing on the  | steps of the Rucellai chapel the day he had first gone with the Ghirlandaio studio to Santa Maria Novella . He saw the chapel vividly before him , the ( ; iinabue and Nino Pisano Madonnas , and felt again his love for his mother , his sense of loss when she was gone , his aloneness , the hunger for love . It had grown late . The meeting broke up . Lorenzo remained . Though at times his tongue was said to have a rough edge , he spoke with naturalness and clarity . " You must forgive our Platonists their enthusiasm , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bust . Landino gives the finest literary banquet of the year on Plato 's anniversary . For us , Plato and the Greeks are the key that has let us escape from a dungeon of religious prejudices . We are trying to establish here in Florence another age of Pericles . In the light of our ambition , you must understand the excesses of our zeal . " " If you are not tired , Lorenzo , " said Michelangelo , " could we make a little tour of the palace and look at the Madonnas and Child ? " Lorenzo took up the highly polished bronze lamp . They went down the corridor until they came to the anteroom of Lorenzo 's office , in which there was a Donatello marble relief , so remote and impersonal , Michelangelo thought , as to prevent identification . From here they went to Giuliano 's bedroom . The youngest Medici continued to sleep , the covers pulled up over his face , while Michelangelo and Lorenzo discussed Pesellino 's Madonna and Child with Two Little Angels , painted on a wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lippi Virgin Adoring Child on the altar of the chapel , about which Lorenzo explained that the models were the nun , Lucrezia Buti , with whom Fra Filippo had fallen in love , and the child of their mating , Filippino Lippi , now a painter who had been trained by Botticelli , even as Botticelli had been trained by Fra Filippo . They examined the Neri di Bicci Madonna ; then went on to Luca della Robbia 's Madonna and Child with the Medici crest , all in high glowing color ; and finally to Lorenzo 's bedroom to see the Botticelli Madonna of the Magnificat , painted for Lorenzo 's father and mother some twenty years before . " Those two angels kneeling before the Virgin and Child are my brother Giuliano and myself . When the Pazzi murdered him , the brightest light went out of my life . . . . The portrait of me is an idealization , as you can see . I am a homely man , and not ashamed of it ; but all painters think I want to he flattered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they make my dark skin light , my turned-up nose straight , my scraggly hair as beautiful as Pico 's . " Lorenzo shot him a piercing look , lips compressed , brow stern . " You appear to know I do n't need flattery . " " Granacci says I 'm crusty , " said Michelangelo , embarrassed .
