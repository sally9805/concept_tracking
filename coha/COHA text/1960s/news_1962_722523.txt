txt LETTERS : ON WEST AFRICA pg . 244 LETTERS : ON WEST AFRICA To the Travel Editor : IN his July 17 artielir on West Africa , Archibald Van Vorhees ' says that he prefers the former colonies 01 the French to those of the British . One reason he gives is that in his youth he was told : The British went to their colonies ? to administer , while the French went to theirs to live . Later he says , when telling how bring the capital of a former English colony is : " The British ' never neglected the religion and education of their colonialicharges . " I have no more interest in French colonies than in English , but I have been doing a lot of thinking since the trouble in Algeria , and I had con* to the conclusion some time ago that the reason England had less trouble in India than France has had in Algeria is that she administered that country better and that she gave the Indians better educational op= portunities .

Your June 3 walking tour of San Francisco was an intersting one but must be amended because of another high-rise apartment building going up , which , along with meandering freeways , are slowly eliminating this city 's unique beauty , to the anger of many residents . The view from Vallejo Street on Russian Hill , mentioned as a " marvelous panorama , " is about to be blocked almost in half by a new skyscraper going up on the block below . A privileged score of persons will have a view eliminated to thousands behind the structure and many more who walk upon the street . An ordinance has been recently passed limiting buildings to forty feet in height in some sections here , but it is spotty and not completely effective . Commercial interests seeking to capitalize on the city 's beautiful setting and views are gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . San Francisco . sume ) in and on a small station wagon . We have been camping for several years with only five children and have had marvelous exciting adventures . In fact , we are leaving this week for a three-week tour through Canada . We have a station wagon ( large ) and find a distinct lack of leg room , carrying much less equipment than Mr. Stockdale , and this with an elaborate roof carrier of =Usual capacity . I just hope that there were not too many prospective campers who read this pessimistic article by Mr. Stockdale . Camping , to us , is a happy care-free experience that lets us get close to nature , live with the elements and affords us an inexpensive way of seeing and exploring our vast continent . I would like you to publish this letter in the hope of perhaps gathering back some of the frightened campers into our fold . PHILIP COHEN . Teaneck , N. J.

I inquired about the approximate 30 per cent discrepancy ( 14 cents is the approximate exchange ink London ) and was informed that " British money is n't any good over here . " I asked a policeman where I could get help in locating a hotel for my family and was told to go to the information desk . After a thirty-minute wait , the young lady informed me that they could not help , but that she would look up the number of any hotel I would like to phone . The Redcap who helped me get family and luggage into a taxi was polite and helpful , a wonderful departure from the course of unhappy events . The taxi driver , however , behaved in stereotyped fashion . He grumbled about our not going to Manhattan . He used audible profanity in navigating the Parkway . At the hotel , he shook his head contemptuously when I gave him $5 to cover the $3.50 fare . Heat is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SYLVESTER V. POINTKOWSKI . Director of Public Relations , New York Transit Authority . New York . DOCTOR IN THE TENT To the Travel Editor : Just what is Mr. Stockdale trying to prove in his June 24 article on camping ? If he is trying to show how cautious concerned he is for his family ' ' health , and welfare , his list is far from adequate . How about a surgical kit in case of appendicitis , or maybe he will need some blood plasma or codeine . Better still , why make the trip at all unless he has a medical degree ? Has the welcome mat really been brought out of dead storage ? If so , we would like to take this opportunity to say high time  --  and hurrah !
