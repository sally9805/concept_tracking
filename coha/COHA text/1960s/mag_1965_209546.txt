" What a helluva bore , " yawned a controller at Houston 's Manned Spacecraft Center as Astronauts Frank Borman and James Lovell monotonously orbited the earth last week . By week 's end , as Gemini 7 completed its seventh uneventful day in space , the flight had indeed escaped the spine-tingling crises that enlivened-and plagued-earlier shots . But the ennui in Houston and elsewhere in the U.S. was a high accolade . It demonstrated that flawless performance has become commonplace , that near-perfect timing , preparation and execution of Gemini flights have become routine . <P> <P> Higher in Tone . Without major troubles to occupy them , the astronauts were free to concentrate on minor ones . <P> Early in the flight they complained that their sleep was being interrupted by the noise of a motor that automatically tightened cuffs around Lovell 's thighs for two out of every six minutes-part of an experiment designed to keep the heart from getting lazy in a weightless environment . Houston promptly agreed to turn the motor off during the ten-hour sleeping period . <P> To alleviate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 on a radio band that would not interfere with normal voice communications . Some of the popular tunes , like Fly Me to the Moon , seemed more appropriate for the Apollo program , others for a teen-age hangout . But later in the week , largely at the urging of NASA Secretary Geri Ann Vanderoef , the Kraft Music Hall , as it was called in honor of Flight Director Chris Kraft ( TIME cover , Aug. 27 ) , took on an elevated tone with selections from Bach , <P> Handel , Glinka and Dvorak . Against this soothing background , Astronaut Lovell was allowed to strip off his space suit and fly in his underwear . He thus became the first U.S. astronaut to fly without a pressurized suit , which affords the only protection against a sudden , accidental decompression of the Gemini spacecraft . <P> Higher in Orbit . The Gemini 7 astronauts chalked up some other , more significant firsts . Once in orbit , they fired thrusters to turn Gemini and adjust its velocity , then flew in formation with their detached , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with setting stars on the earth 's horizon , they were able to navigate precisely without aid from computers on the ground . They were also able to track the first three minutes of the spectacular flight of a Polaris missile as it was fired from beneath the Atlan tic by the nuclear submarine Benjamin Franklin . <P> <P> Only a few minor troubles marred the otherwise perfect flight . A fuel-cell warning light flashed on , but the cell itself appeared to be operating perfectly . The astronauts were unable to spot another light-a laser beam projected from a station in Hawaii-and thus could not conduct a planned laser voice-communications experiment . Astronaut Borman also sheepishly reported that a urine-sample bag had come apart in his hand . <P> <P> " Before or after ? " queried Houston . <P> " After , " Borman reported ruefully . <P> " Sorry about that , Chief , " said Flight Surgeon Charles Berry . <P> Late in the week , when accelerated preparations at Cape Kennedy all but guaranteed that Gemini 6 and Astronauts Wally Schirra and Tom Stafford would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered into a new orbit .
