txt Unless the trend described in these columns yesterday is reversed , the city administration faces complete frustration in its housing and planning programs . The situation is not being helped by the , current confusions concerning Waterside , the imaginative plan for housing on a platform in the East River , which is sponsored by the Housing and Redevelopment Board and is about to be voted on by the Board of Estimate . Criticism of Waterside centers on the small propor tion of low and moderate income housing in relatior to more expensive units , and on the tax abatement given to the developer . Both criticisms miss the point Waterside is just the kind of housing that the city urgently needs to maintain its vanishing middle-class base , a productive and essential part of the population that has so much to do with keeping the city alive , It is the kind of imaginative and progressive planning that is essential to make the city a better and more humane place to live . It involves the kind of financing - ? utilization of private investment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by cities everywhere as the effective answer to housing shortages . Without city aid , equivalent apartments would be built to higher rents and lower standards . Without city sponsorship , there would be no coordinated provision for desirable riverfront amenities , and they would be for private , not public , use . Whatever the city will receive in taxes for building over the river will be found money , since the area returns no revenue now . What the city gives is a subsidy for the kind of superior land use which no private builder will provide without incentive . This is not , as charged by the opposition , a subsidy for housing the rich . It is not extra money in the builder 's pocket , an equally ridiculous accusation in a limited-profit project . It is a way of reducing rents below speculative luxury levels . It does not subtract in any way from resources for housing the poor . Suggestions to the contrary are irresponsible distortions of fact .

Mortgage interest rates and rents are already higher than they would have been six months ago . With constantly rising costs , financial backing is jeopardized by further delays . New York 's - housing decisions have been largely based on a kind of cautious cynicism that holds up , or holds over , all progressive plans . If Waterside is defeated , and that would be a defeat for New York , it will no doubt be the victim of the spurious reasoning that is sabotaging so much of the city 's current efforts  --  the kind of irrational , emotioncharged hostility aroused by any housing except that for the poor . - The poor are not helped by finessing other housing needs . Admittedly , only low-cost housing makes popular politics . To vote against Waterside would be a dubious political ploy for obvious political hay , or a willful misunderstanding of New York 's requirements . - It would give the Board of Estimate the doubtful dis , Unction of keeping the city 's curious housing record : . intact : few hits , many errors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
