In a casual fancy , S. J. Perelman once concocted an actor of surpassing ego . " I see a fresh new concept of drama knocking at the door , " he said . " A theatre without plays . . . devoid of scenery and untrammeled by actors . " <P> " And what would be left ? " <P> " Just me . Face facts-the day I donned greasepaint , a whole profession became obsolete . " <P> Perelman named his actor Basil Woolwine . He could just as well have called him Anthony Newley . In the latest case of lifelessness imitating artlessness , Newley continues his long love affair with Newley . Can Heironymus Merlcin Ever Forget Mercy Humppe and Find True Happiness ? " is a real ego trip , " says the Director-Writer-Star . But it is less a trip than a misfired space shot blasting $1,250,000 to ashes . <P> As in his theatrical I-pieces , Stop the World and The Roar of the Greasepaint , Newley again presents himself as an overpainted everymannikin , this time named Heironymus Merkin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> As a youth , Merkin is tempted by the Devil ( Milton Berle ) . From then on , girls fall in line beside his bed . From time to time Merkin is visited by Death ( George Jessel ) who gazes at Merkin with basilisk eyes and bleats standup jokes that are as dead as vaudeville . Eventually , even he sighs , " I think I should warn you I 'm getting new material . " <P> A wise move . The script by Herman Raucher and Newley never graduates to the sophomoric . Female characters are given Ian Fleming labels with a touch of Li'l Abner : Polyester Poontang , Miss Maidenhead Fern , Trampolena Whambang and Miss Hope Climax . Jokes consist of lethal single entendres like " Heironymus lays them in the aisles , " or Berle 's remark as he rows a boat on a sandy beach : " I have n't passed water in three days . " Between them , Newley rants some chants that are mislabeled songs , appears more naked than his victims , and plots along in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . <P> Hello World . " I still do n't think that Anthony Newley is a household name , " Newley complains offscreen . " It 's a bit of a bummer , as they say . " <P> The Heironymus bummer began shooting on the isle of Malta . But " the editor of the Times of Malta started a campaign about the decadent film unit , " he says . " Suddenly there were cops everywhere . They were pressuring me not to shoot the scene where I make love to Mercy in the grass . Eventually we did shoot it ... we had to go in the grass very deep . " If he had trouble with the fuzz , it was even worse with some of the cast . " Berle is one of the great monsters of our time , " he says . " You believe he 's the Devil because he 's such an s.o.b . anyway . " <P> As far as the film 's sexual interludes go-and they manage simultaneously to go too far and not far enough-those , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm really antifeminist , " he admits . " If a man really loved women , he 'd treat them with more respect . " But then , how can you offer respect when you do n't have much , even for yourself ? " Perhaps once you stop being hungry , you do n't produce such good stuff , " says Newley the film critic . " I 'm beginning to lose it . My work-all of it - is a hobby now . "
