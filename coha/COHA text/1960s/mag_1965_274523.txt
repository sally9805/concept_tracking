For a tall man , France 's Charles de Gaulle has mastered a difficult diplomatic trick : the art of stooping without actually bending an inch . He likes to employ it whenever his allies get particularly incensed at his prideful , nationalistic policies , since it invariably produces a smile of relief all around without changing anything . Last week , as the 15 ministers of the NATO Council assembled in London to a fanfare from six trumpeters of the Royal Regiment of Artillery . De Gaulle , though not present himself , was at his stooping best . <P> Knee Flexing . His timing was , of course , superb , since nearly everyone was mad at him . British Prime Minister Harold Wilson bluntly told the council that " no nation , however great , can think in terms of going it alone , without allies and without regard for world opinion . " Belgium 's Paul-Henri Spaak was just as pointed , warning that " whatever makes nations retire within themselves , out of a somewhat old-fashioned pride , is out of date and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened , Ludwig Erhard in a speech relayed via Early Bird to the U.S. but meant in part for the Elyse Palace , said : " We learned the bitter lesson that power politics guided by excessive nationalist feelings is doomed to failure . Europe can not be German , French or Russian . " <P> So le grand Charles flexed his knees . Suddenly . France sweetly agreed to a draft statement on German reunification that emphasized U.S. concern in the matter . This was a sharp reversal from earlier French insistence that reunification was primarily a " European " concern . Shrugged De Gaulle 's official spokesman : It was never his government 's intention " to remove the U.S. from a solution of the German problem . " What was more , the French gently papered over their differences with the U.S. on policy in Viet Nam and the Dominican Republic . Fortnight ago , Paris was hinting it intended to recognize the Dominican rebels ; last week France announced without a trace of embarrassment that it never recognized " governments , " only " states . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erhard , who has been buffeted for weeks by a series of ill foreign winds . One from the Middle East finally blew itself out last week with the formalization of diplomatic relations between West Germany and Israel-a historic decision that surprisingly drew hardly a squeak from the Arabs . Another has been Erhard 's deteriorating relations with Treaty Partner France . But from the Elyse Palace came another balm-a friendly longhand letter from De Gaulle saying he would be glad to move up the date of his next meeting with Erhard . De Gaulle even implied he would be glad to talk about German reunification . <P> For his part , Erhard , though gratified , made it plain that the chat might not be as pleasant for the general as their last , where De Gaulle airily promised new impetus to European integration , on which he has since reneged . Erhard intends to talk tough-and pointedly disclosed at week 's end that before he saw De Gaulle he was going to the U.S. for a chat with Lyndon Johnson .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
