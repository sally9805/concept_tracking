LOST EMPIRES by J. B. Priestley. 364 pages . Atlantic-Little , Brown . $5.95 . <P> SIR MICHAEL &; SIR GEORGE by J. B. Priestley. 244 pages . Atlantic-Little , Brown . $4.95 . <P> <P> Britain 's J. B. Priestley writes rather more than the average man talks . In the past 44 years he has published 37 plays , 29 volumes of nonfiction and 22 novels . His worst novels read as easy as a rug unrolls , and his best novels ( Angel Pavement , The Good Companions ) sound like Dickens updated and not too much marked down . Now 71 , Priestley gives no evidence of deceleration-in recent months he has published two new novels in the U.S. Lost Empires is a warm , rowdy , old-fashioned tale about the vaudeville circuits in Britain half a century ago . Sir Michael &; Sir George is a broad burlesque of bureaucrazy in Britain 's welfare state . Both books provide the considerable Priestley public with no end of delightful antics by a delightful antique . <P> <P> THE EGYPTOLOGISTS by Kingsley Amis and Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> <P> Kingsley Amis ( Lucky Jim ) and Robert Conquest ( onetime literary editor of The Spectator ) were educated at Oxford , and both are sometime university dons . Between them , they have produced 18 books , including six novels and four volumes of poetry ; in collaboration , they have edited the science-fiction " Spectrum " anthologies . Now they have attempted a comic novel . Like many others , this one assumes that there is surefire hilarity when British characters natter away with upper-class accents on low-class subjects . Not so . This story , about a group of lecherous London husbands who organize the scholarly sounding Metropolitan Egyptological Society as a cover for some amorous prowling , is about as funny as King Tut 's tomb . And just as lively . <P> <P> THE TWISTED THING by Mickey Spillane. 219 pages . Dutton. $3.95 . <P> <P> " You lousy slob ! " says Dilwick the police chief . " Shut up , pig , " says Mike Hammer-for him , an exquisitely genteel response . He has already extracted several of Dilwick 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatal phlebotomy with a .38-cal. slug . The action in Mickey Spillane 's 18th book is embossed with his usual delicate imagery ( " The sun was thumbing its nose at the night " ) , characterization ( " On some people skin is skin , but on her it was an invitation to dine " ) , and grammar ( " You lay there , kid " ; " I thought I could discern shouts " ) . As always , the forces of law , order and decency prove no match for Spillane 's private eye , whose impatience with those virtues amounts to a crusade . The people who lay around reading Spillane books-50 million copies sold to date-must discern the same message .
