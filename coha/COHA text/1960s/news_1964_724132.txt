txt New York A flaring controversy over New York State 's power to enforce racial balance in schoolrooms has alarmed many people here because it opens up significant political implications . Not only New York but the whole United States could be affected . The match that lit the fuse was a decision by the appellate division of the State Supreme Court . This upheld the right of the State Education Commissioner , Dr. James E. Allen , to order local school districts to move children from school to school to achieve white-Negro balances in enrollments . It at once aroused spirited opposition from parents , taxpayers ' groups , and others . New Note Injected According to a spot check by this newspaper , many people now fear that this opposition is strengthening the so-called " white backlash " elements in the North . Immediately , a new note is injected into the presidential campaign . Many " backlash " voters , opposed to any administrative action aimed at hastening integration , strongly support Sen. Barry Goldwater , who needs all the northern votes he can muster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developments in every state , told The Christian Science Monitor flatly : " Artificial methods like New York 's , to deliberately produce integration , will drive the moderates of the United States into Goldwater 's arms . Political Effects Seen " This is the type of action which is likely to give Goldwater votes in most of the states where racial difficulties exist . " On the other hand , teachers and some other educators applauded the court decision precisely because it backed the civil-rights cause to the hilt . " This will create emotion , but we have to face the facts , " said Dr. Frederick C. McLaughlin , director of the Public Education Association . Objections Natural " People object to slum clearance , despite the good the clearance does for the general community . " People will object to integration . But it must come . Dr. Allen is right . Appeasement never strengthened anybody except the person appeased , " commented Al Shanker , president of the United Teachers ' Federation . " The more temporizing and delay there is in taking forthright action to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when such action becomes unavoidable . Time Stressed " The longer these matters are unresolved , the longer those who oppose integration can hope they can modify the plans being put forward . " What New York State does has influence , in such questions . It is moving toward integration in schools much faster than all but a handful of other states . Very few other states give their education commissioners the power to act that Dr. Allen has . The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in New York says the court decision " clears the way for the commissioner to act firmly throughout the state wherever de facto segregated schools are maintained , " An NAACP official listed nine other school districts in the state where the NAACP intended to press for action . The ruling which touched off the current controversy referred specifically to the School District of Malverne , a comfortable Long Island suburb . Authority Backed But the forceful , nine-page decision , handed down in Albany by Associate Justice Herbert D. Hamm , appeared to range over wider ground than the purely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissioner in his authority . The background to the decision is this : Last year the NAACP asked the commissioner to correct racial imbalance at the Woodfield Road School , Malverne , which has 75 percent Negro enrollment . The NAACP brought a suit before Dr. Allen . On June 17 , 1963 , the commissioner warned that any school with a nonwhite enrollment of more than 50 percent was in danger of becoming racially unbalanced . Test Case Set Up In what was seen as a test case , he directed the Malverne school system to reorganize . He designated Malverne as an " attendance area " rather than a number of neighborhoods , and ordered that all children through third grade were to go to two schools . Each of these had a Negro enrollment of about 14 percent . All children from the fourth to the sixth grades were to attend the Woodfield Road school ? thus reducing its imbalance . Grades six through high school were to continue at their regular schools . Parents React Sharply Parents involved were furious . They protested the reorganization to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court upheld him , reversing Justice Isadore Book-stein . The case is not yet over . White parents protesting the case have indicated they will carry their fight to the State Court of Appeals . It is understood they are also prepared to go to the Supreme Court of the United States for a ruling if necessary . Some people close to the Malverne situation claim the white parents are not objecting on racial grounds at all . Opposition Asserted The executive secretary of the Parents ' and Taxpayers ' Coordinating Council for New York State , Mrs. Rosemary Gunning , told The Christian Science Monitor : " The point here is that the rights of parents to choose the environment they want their children brought up in is being disregarded  --  and for dubious educational reasons . " " And , ironically , you 'll find that the majority of Negro parents are opposed to this shifting children around . I know . " This %low is denied by NAACP officials .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
