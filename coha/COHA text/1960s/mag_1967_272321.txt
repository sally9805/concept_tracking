Ever since the Paris house of Balmain made her wedding dress 17 years ago , Thailand 's Queen Sirikit has been true to the designer in her fashion . The results have been dazzling for both . For six years , the Queen was listed among the world 's ten best-dressed women . For his part , Balmain now picks up about $500,000 in annual business from Sirikit , a fact that rankles the house of Dior deeply . Last week , when Sirikit and King Bhumibol paid a state visit to the Shah of Iran and Empress Farah Diba , Dior dispatched six of its staff members to study Sirikit 's tastes in couture and see if they could n't recommend a few designs that she might buy on a Paris spree later this spring . " I prefer Balmain because I happened to know him before I knew Dior , " Sirikit kept insisting to friends . Evidently Dior will have to content itself with fashioning glad rags for Farah Diba , who spends a mere $80,000 per year on such vanities . <P> The morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joke about the approaching ordeal . No one was sure of election but that the possible rejection of some chum cast its gloom over the day . <P> - Stover at Yale <P> The Tap Day ordeal is not quite so horrible these days as it used to be . Still , all the Yalie juniors were holding their breath somewhat as the tappers fanned out from the windowless " tombs " of Yale 's secret senior societies to perform the annual laying on of hands to select new members to their august company . Elihu , Scroll &; Key , and the other four recognized societies chose more than 100 third-year men . Like Dink , Olympic Swimming Champion Don Schollander , 20 , who brought back four gold medals from Tokyo in 1964 , was tapped for Skull &; Bones . In grateful awe , he accepted . <P> Political Gagman Art Buchwald got the star billing , of course . But still , Bill Moyers , 32 , won his share of the laughs when he rose to address the Women 's National Press Club in Washington . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is owned by Captain Harry Guggenheim , Moyers told the " true inside story " of how he came to leave the White House . " The President called me in one day and said : ' Bill , when you took over as press secretary , the polls were 60-40 for me . Now they 're 40-60 against me . In those days the credibility gap was just a line in one of Everett Dirksen 's sonnets . Now it 's a national issue . What do you think ? ' When I said I thought I 'd better call Harry Guggenheim , you know what the President did ? He gave me a dime. "
