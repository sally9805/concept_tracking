Ski jumping is something like walking on water-the first step is the hardest . The view from the top is discouraging : the ice-slick starting slope falls away at an abrupt 35 for take-off speeds up to 60 m.p.h .. and the ambulance at the end of the landing run seems so far away that it might be a Tootsie Toy . Once a jumper starts , there is no turning back : a wobbly takeoff , a sudden updraft. a slight miscalculation can mean a bone-shattering spill - and many a star of this perilous sport admits to frequent tussles with panic . <P> Nose to Tip . Such jitters apparently never afflict Toralf Engan , 26 , a brown-haired , slightly built sporting-goods salesman from Trondheim . Norway . Engan has been skiing since he was three , jumping since he was seven , and outjumping almost everyone for nearly a decade . " When I jump . " he says . " I feel like a bird . Birds are n't afraid to fly . Why should I be ? " <P> Awaiting his turn in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glassy wax surface on his skis . Then he is on his way , whistling down the slide , tucking his body into a ball to get more speed . Soaring high above the hill , arms pressed tightly along his sides , body tilted forward until his nose is inches from the tips of his skis , Engan has perfect balance . " Until I touch down , " he says . " I could just as well close my eyes . " <P> Through the Fog . Form counts heavily in points ; yet Engan wins mainly because of the fantastic distance he can fly . He was sick and unable to compete for the 1960 Olympic team . But last year he won 22 of the 24 major events he entered , including the 65-meter world championship at Zakopane , Poland . Last week , competing against 72 jumpers from 14 nations in the German-Austrian Four Hills Championship , Engan demonstrated why he is the odds-on favorite to win an Olympic gold medal in 1964 . <P> At Oberstdorf , he turned in the longest jumps of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Berg Isel ski jump , site of next year 's Olympic jumping , Engan broke the hill record with a 298-ft. jump . Fog and snow made a nightmare of Germany 's Garmisch-Partenkirchen a few days later . But Engan still went 292 ft. - 16 ft. past the " critical point . " or safety limit of the hill . After the first three hills , he had the championship sewed up . " All he needs , " said a competitor , " is to toss his shoes over the edge . " Yet on the fourth hill at Bischofshofen. he still jumped 320 ft. , longest leap of the entire series . <P> Engan 's rivals call him " the world 's safest jumper " because he has never been injured in 15 years of competition . Crowds of up to 135,000 turn out to watch him make like a bird . He is a national hero in Norway , where his biography is a bestseller , and in Austria children mimic his style on tiny backyard ski jumps-the one who jumps farthest gets to call himself Toralf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
