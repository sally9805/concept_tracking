Status Cymbal Not my pun . It 's a department in a new magazine called Status , dedicated not to The Beautiful People , as in Vogue , or to the playfuls , as in Playboy , but to The Regtless Ones . People laughed , as the old ad went , when Igor Cassini announced a year ago that he planned to publish it . Things had n't been going so well for the former Cholly Knickerbocker of the New York Journal-American since he was indicted in 1963 on a federal charge for failing to register as a foreign agent for the former Trujillo regime , fined $1o,000 and dropped by his paper . Even Cassini admitted that the greatest difficulty in launching a new publication ? described as " a critical journal of elegance " and devoted to " people who are . . . bored with the banal , the mediocre and the common " was the number of persons who were convinced it would never appear . Yet here it is at 75 cents a copy , initially reported as backed by " people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identified , " by an Italian weekly called Le Ore ( which in turn is financed by a Swiss banking interest called the Golden Arrow , S.A. ) , and printed and distributed by the Curtis Publishing Company . It is not only on expensive slick paper , 100 pages thick and with many color reproductions , but graced , if that is the word , by such names as Alberto Moravia , William Saroyan , Salvador Dali , Joseph Wechsberg , Nat Hentoff and others who might be expected to have sufficient ? and preferred ? alternative outlets . But what gives the magazine its real , its unique , . cachet is the writing of Mr. Cassini himself , which has to be read not to be believed . In the November issue , after stating that Status has " spliced together a gay nosegay ? with serious overtones , " the editor and publisher invites us to join in the game of In and . Out : " Played like one , but the end of the game suggests the staggering importance of the stakes . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " After telling us that pop art refrigerators are in and Lady Bird Johnson is out , he amplified his philosophy bysaying that although this is a " fun game which any number can play , destroying and creating people and things on a month-to-month basis " it is actually " playing for the future structure of our society . " " We all need status symbols for our ultimate security , but J. Pierpont Morgan and his yacht Corsair just do n't do it for us any more . " What does is to know that Thanksgiving and Chastity ( virginity ) are In ( " Status feels it is not necessary for a woman to sleep around " ) ; that Thomas Wolfe and credit cards are Out , and that " real pearls in the navel are In . " So is something called Merkin-makers . As for The Restless . Ones , there are three pages of them , snapshots above , inimitable Cassini prose below . Here we learn that Status ' Paris correspondent , Cynthia Grenier , has just signed a contract with Pocket Books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her experiences as a Playboy correspondent " ) ; that one of the men heiress Barbara Hutton did n't Marry will shortly be in New York , leaving behind the $75,000 villa that his wife Penny ( you know , the monocled George Ansley 's daughter ) bought ; and that an enterprising young Dutchman called Shippers has prepared a program of smells , the " first of its kind in the world . " 10 a.m . Orange . 11 a.m . Pencils . But Status can be even more serious . It can propose a successor to fashion model Shrimpton , and present Dali 's observations , among other startling insights , that a rhinoceros ' behind is " nothing short of a sunflower folded double . " It prints serious recipes and serious reviews of the cultural scene , serious photographs , and in this particular issue , a perfectly good piece by Paul Gardner on what 's wrong with television documentaries . Half of the magazine could be pirt of any fashionable glossy on the newsstands . But not Cassini . He makes all the difference . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonus should determine how long Status will be around . . . or Out .
