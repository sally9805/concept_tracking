txt Letters to The Times pg . 34 Letters to The Times Cost of Medicare Public Held Misinformed on Bill 's Economic Consequences To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : J. Douglas  --  prown in The Times of May 30 accuses. the American Medical Association of deliberate , clever and precious propaganda to confuse the American people . If the A. M. A. spokesman of May 20 was clever , the political proponents of the KingAnderson bill cynically delude the public about its benefits , costs and practicality . Dean Brown does n't seem to know that the New Jersey State Legislature , only fifteen miles from Princeton , has penuriously not committed New Jersey to the Kerr-Mills Act , presumably because it expects to get out from under the obligation to pay state funds for what the Federal Government will pay if the King-Anderson bill becomes law . And what about the dozen or so other states which have chosen not to go along with the Kerr-Mills Act ? Will they elect to come under its provisions once the King-Anderson bill is law ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to do so if the King-Anderson bill is passed ? Medicine Debased To paraphrase one of economics ' favorite laws , a bad law will always drive a good law out of circulation . The abuse of health insurance plans has already debased good medicine ? chiefly , I say , because the public 's appetite for medical care is not matched by its wish to pay for it . I firmly believe that if education is the concern of the state , then so should health be ; not just the health of a jrivileged class that lets its dignity be cheapened by the maudlin designation of senior citizen , but of all citizens . Medical care Is an economic goods which competes with other commodities for the consumer 's dollar or the tax dollar . Health and education are rhetorically priceless but economically not boundless . The taxpayers are already grumbling about elementary and high school budgets and rejecting school bond referenda . The cost is being questioned . So with government health programs . The preliminary estimate for the King-Anderson bill was one billion dollars ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two billion . If we are to have socialized medicine  --  and I am not opposed to it ? let us first have a definition of the ingredients that go into health , and what we should are to be pay the for .

GEORGE R. WALKER . Concord , Mass. , June 8 , 1962 . Governor 's Bias Stand To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Tam : I was shocked to read in The Times a report of the speech of Democratic National Chairman ' Bailey charging Governor Rockefeller with racial prejudice . I am aware of the fact that it is stated that anything is fair in love , war and politics . But to deliberately charge Governor Rockefeller or any member of his family with racial prejudice , when the Governor 's record and that of his family prove just the opposite , is. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Democratic State Chairman , William , who dissociated himself from this charge and apologized on Bailey 's behalf to the Governor , ; No public official is perfect , though Governor Rockefeller 's term of office has demonstrated his ability as an administrator  --  and a , humanitarian . qwq There you will find equal duplicNew York , June 6 , 1962 .

There you will find that the United States will explode bombs in the atmosphere despite anguished cries from reputable ' scientists all over the world . It is time for a change . If thin change does not occur it 's all over for mankind . This change must take the form of a new kind of thinking . Thinking which looks at reality .

It 's pure nonsense to justify destruction of the earth for one ideology or another which will go out of fashion in due time .. BERNICE BAUMAN . Mount Vernon , N. Y. , May 31 , 1962 . Funds in the Market Improved Discipline Wanted to Prevent Withdrawing Money Supply To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES There is general agreement that the basic need of our economy is an increase in total demand for goods and services . If we could achieve this we would have increased sales , production and profits , lower unit costs and less unemployment . Why is demand slack ? If it is because of an insufficient money supply the obvious remedy is to increase the money supply . This could be done , without resort to budget deficits , by allowing the Federal Reserve to require commercial banks to pay a moderate rate of interest on their excess reserves , which now amount to about $500 million . If these excess reserves were fully utilized there would be an increase in the money supply of about $3 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Federal Reserve can regulate bank reserves at will , but at present the banks can offset and nullify Federal Reserve policy by not putting their excess reserves to work . If , on the other hand , the money supply is now ample to finance the desired increase in gross product then the trouble is that a portion of the money supply is not being used . In this case we shall have to reexamine the discipline of the market , as it applies to those who own or control investment funds , and see why it is not as effective- as it should be . Effect of Reinvestment privilege . Hospitalization is not the answer , nor is social legislation , though one wonders if beneficiaries of public funds were not permitted to vote on welfare bills whether the politicians would be so nobly moved . Everybody loves his baby , and Dean Brown 's baby is Social Security . But this baby is likely to eat us out of house and home , and by the time we achieve social adequacy we will have lost individual equity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? is one of those miracle drugs whose complications will be passed on to the next generation . So who cares now ? NICHOLAS G. DEMY , M. D. Somerville , N. J. , June 4 , 1962 . U. S. Position Criticized To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIM ES : In your editorial of May 31 " The U. N. 's Future Form " you mentioned again Russia 's record of duplicity , insincerity , agreement breaking , etc.
