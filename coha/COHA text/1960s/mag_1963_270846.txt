A Gross of Cheers <P> Sir : I read your cover story of Dr. Calvin Gross Nov. 15 with great interest and a deep feeling of pride . My friend and classmate through elementary and high schools has been living up to everyone 's expectations . You depict a person of near-infallibility . I must agree with you .

PITTS President <P> Miles College <P> Birmingham <P> <P> Up the Goldwater Tree <P> Sir : Senator Goldwater 's reactionary plans Nov. 8 , if carried out , would interrupt the natural growth of the American Tree of State . Instead of merely trimming the tree at its edges as the true conservative would do , or grafting on new branches as the liberal would do , Senator Goldwater would tear the tree out by its roots , leaving not the idyllic green pasture of Jeffersonian democracy but the torn black earth of destruction . <P> <P> ALAN K.
