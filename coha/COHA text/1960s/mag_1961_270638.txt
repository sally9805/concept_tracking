SOME PEOPLE , PLACES , &; THINGS THAT WILL NOT APPEAR IN MY NEXT NOVEL ( 175 pp. ) - John Cheever-Harper ( $3.50 ) . <P> About six months ago , Author John ( The Wapshot Chronicle ) Cheever announced publicly that " life in the U.S. in 1960 is hell . " Since hell is a private estate , it might be supposed that he could have been speaking merely for himself . But his scores of short stories and now this book of new ones prove plainly , of course , that he was speaking as well for his not-so-fictional characters . The hell he has staked out for them is by now unmistakably Cheever country ( nice house , nice income , nice wife , nice kids , all of it tasting of despair and a thick tongue the morning after ) . But only rarely is there a true hellion to be found there . There are , rather , middleclass , earthly sufferers whose jobs are as uncertain or as unsatisfying as their moral underpinnings , their visions of goodness constantly clouded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtake them and their neighbors . <P> Some People , Places , &; Things That Will Not Appear in My Next Novel could easily turn out to be a misnomer . If the title is accurate , it would be good news , for Author Cheever is in danger of getting bogged down in his talent-lined rut . He promises in the future to drop " all lushes , " but The Scarlet Moving Van is the story of the handsome All-America football star who is so frightened by life that he turns to the jug and throws away the stopper . His Brimmer is another charming lush whose great wastes of emptiness can be filled in only with the help of alcohol and indiscriminate sex . Typically they are men with much in them that is good , and Author Cheever registers their fright and decline with delicate ruefulness and in writing that is unfailingly readable . But how they got that way is something that he too casually skirts . <P> The Death of Justina is a more explicit try at sketching a corner of hell in suburban U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , but the town is so carefully zoned that in his neighborhood there are no undertakers and none are permitted to come from outside to pick her up . The only solution , his doctor tells him , is to take her across the zoning line in his car . But Justina 's death is merely the incident that fires the smoldering discontent of a man whose daily stint is to commute to the city and turn out TV commercials . Cheever is almost surely speaking for himself when his frustrated adman says : " There are some Americans who , although their fathers emigrated from the Old World three centuries ago , never seem to have quite completed the voyage , and I am one of these . " <P> Abroad , Cheever seems to find a new freedom ; the three stories about Italy have the charm and knowingness that come only to a writer who has thrown away the guidebook . But hell , at least Cheever 's hell , is ever waiting just around the corner . In The Golden Age , the U.S. " situation-comedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is one . Somewhat guiltily he tries to create the impression that he is a poet-but poetic justice triumphs . Up to his rented castle comes a delegation headed by the mayor . They have just seen an episode of The Best Family , and they have been moved . Says the mayor : " Oh , we thought , Signore , that you were merely a poet . "
