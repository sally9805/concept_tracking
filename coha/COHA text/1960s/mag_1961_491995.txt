Love Made Me an American By OLGA FIKOTOVA CONNOLLY Iwas running along the Santa Monica Beach one day last year . The question an old man had asked me was still on my mind . At first I laughed it off , but then I remembered how many times I had heard it before . Why do all these people ask me if I am a wrestler ? I wondered . Do I look lake a person who would particularly enjoy grappling on a sweaty mat ? That incident might very well have been the last blow to my injured vanity , but when ithappened I was completely preoccupied with something which seemed far more important : the hard training for Olympic competition . I had a difficult time with my training . There was something lacking  --  not hard work or determination , but something else I just could n't pin down , My husband was the one who found the trouble . " Olga , " he observed one afternoon , " I have noticed for quite a time already that you do n't enjoy your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but your mind is elsewhere . " Then he explained why it was different for me in America in 1960 than it had been in Czechoslovakia in 1956 . Taking care of my home and husband and giving constant attention to my little baby Mark diverted my interest from athletic activities . Furthermore , I was working part time in a laboratory and studying part time , with hopes of one day resuming medical studies . Moreover , I was feeling responsible for putting us into debt because I wanted to go to the Olympic Games again . Most married American amateur athletes 16 have financial worries when it conics to international competition , and when there are two competing in one family , the problems double . I have been engaged in sports for a long time . Ever since I was a little girl I have loved the beauty of perfect motion . When I was small 1 loved to dance for my parents to the exciting radio music of the Czech folk songs . Long walks with my mother and father through the fields on the outskirts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned to skate when I was four years old . Figure skating was a great love of mine during the war . Although I was taking no formal lessons , I learned many of the routines as I saw other children practice them . When my skates became too small for me , I wore them on my bare feet . I would n't say anything to my mother , knowing that my parents could n't afford to buy me a new pair . My toes became so seriously frostbitten that today my husband sometimes whispers in my ear , " I love you  --  even with your curly little toes . " When I was about fourteen the kids from the neighborhood asked me to play European handball with them . This is a game which can be compared to basketball , but instead of baskets there are goals , as in soccer . The first position I tried to play was that of goalie . I stayed in the handball goal for three and a half years , becoming the youngest member of the Czechoslovakian national women 's handball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived as a top player the game started to lose its challenge for me . Therefore , when a basketball team was formed in my school , I joined it . After two years I became adept enough at the pivot to make my second national team . this time in basketball . However , I never became a top player , chiefly because by this time I was in my senior year of secondary school and preparing for final exams . Some years before , I had slipped from a roof and seriously fractured my arm . The six weeks I spent in the hospital gave me medical ambitions . While in the gymnasium ( the equivalent of high school plus two years of college ) I had taken volunteer-nurse courses and worked in the hospital every weekend . In 1952 I passed the entrance exams for the Medical School of Charles University in Prague . After entering the school , the amount of time I could spend on the basketball court was drastically reduced . Besides , the team had been assigned a new coach , whom I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me in about the same way , I found myself most of the time on the bench . Eventually I found myself something else to do . Hiking and skiing with my friends , in order to get some of nature 's fresh air and sunshine , became my every weekend recreation . In the spring of 1955 a fellow student found somewhere an old rubber discus . He brought it to school and said , " Olino , learn to throw this , and you will go to the Olympics in Australia , next year . " Everybody laughed . " Yes , " said another voice , " we 'll start saving for the victory celebration now . A bottle of champagne for your return . " " Just get a big one , " I answered . An old coach I knew was the director of a sports school for youth , only ten minutes away from my student quarters . After a visit with him , I declared at school , " I am betting one bottle of champagne with every one of you that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your daily schedule to add a two-hour track-and-field workout to a full day of lectures , studies and laboratory work ? I did it as follows : I worked out at five A.M. , then rushed to the streetcar and to school , came home , ate a huge meal , took an hour 's nap and then got up to study . After midnight I took a few practice spins , with a book serving as a discus , before quitting for the day . Summer vacation came as a welcome change , believe me . I moved from Prague to Libis , a small town about twenty miles distant , where my parents lived and worked in a chemical plant . My daddy , who himself used to be an athlete , became so enthused about my training that he was never absent during the workouts . His fervor infected even my mother , who up to then had never been too keen to see me in basketball or handball matches , because she was always frightened I would twist my ankle or break a rib . My mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were several great meets in my first summer of throwing . To my sweet surprise and to the bitter disbelief of my opponents , I always managed to make one or two fair enough throws to get third , second or , sometimes , first place . With the fall came the championship of Czechoslovakia . A 156-foot throw gave me the title and the nomination to the national team in track and field . My fellow students now really started to save for the champagne . Another school year came , and with it the five-A.m. - to- one- A.m. race again . By the spring of 1956 the schoolwork was absorbing me completely , and in a series of pre-Olympic competitions I performed rather poorly . Still I continued my training routine  --  sprinting , jumping , throwing and gymnastics . Once , while doing a few tired last-minute push-ups before climbing into bed . I fell asleep in the center of the carpet . I woke up in the morning with the rug design neatly printed on my face . With the help of all the saints , I passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final one before the summer vacation . Totally exhausted , I retreated to my parents ' house . After four days of sleep , intetrtipted only by short walks and meals , my dad and I headed for the stadium . My discus flew that day as though it were equipped with a rocket . In fifteen official competitions between then and November , I ( Continued on Page 52 ) never threw under 160 feet . ( The winning women 's Olympic discus throw in 1952 had been 168 feet , eight and a half inches . ) Several times I broke the Czechoslovakian national record . Early in November my discus and I were shipped to Melbourne to show what we could do . " You have always been an exhibitionist , " claimed my old Uncle Jarda , the sports expert of our family . Statistically he attempted to prove that 1 had never done too well when there were less than 2000 fans at a meet . He said , " With over a hundred thousand spectators at the Olympic Games , the odds are overwhelmingly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was off to Australia . It is hard to enjoy fully a trip through foreign countries when you have such a responsible assignment as representing your nation in the Olympic Games . In Melbourne we were greeted with the warmth of a city living only for the Olympic Games . The Olympic Village on the outskirts of town was filled with Australian hosts trying successfully to please everybody . 1 had not the slightest idea that I did n't arrive merely at a new continent , but at the crossroad of my life . My rendezvous with fate started very innocently . Walking out from an equipment shack on the muddy practice field . 1 bumped into one of the thousands of athletes living in the village and sharing training facilities . The dirt which nearly covered the large " U.S.A. " on his shirt told me he had just finished training and was returning his equipment . Ten minutes 1 spent comparing my Czech accent with a Bostonian one in a fragmentary English conversation . I found myself wishing I had spent more time with my English home lessons in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a proper Bostonian . We walked in the village for hours , discussing our interests , philosophies and plans for the future . They differed indescribably . Our main concern , however , was the coming competition . I competed on the very first day after the opening ceremonies . I thought it would never arrive . Suddenly the day came , and then I thought , If I only had a few more mornings of preparation ! At the morning qualifications in the women 's discus very few onlookers were present . Yet the tension of the athletes is greater in the preliminary elimination than it is in the " for-real " competition in the afternoon . There is a line on the grass marking a distance which must be thrown in order for an athlete to make the finals . Nearly everybody has thrown over this line countless times , but suddenly the silly mark seems to move farther and farther away before your eyes . Well , the Melbourne competition , as tense as it was , ended luckily for me . I qualified for the finals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . one and a quarter inches  --  three feet ahead of two Russian girls , IrMa Beglyakova and Nina Ponomareva . When I held the Bold medal in my hand , 1 could think only about my family hearing the news over the radio and Uncle Jarda saying , " The reason she won was because of the hundred and five thousand spectators . " My family was not celebrating my victory alone . Track and field is a tremendously popular sport in Europe . There are never less than 30,000 people watching a major competition in Czechoslovakia . And when the firs ! medal on the first day of the Games went to a girl from little Libis , you can understand why beer was on the house in all the restaurants in my home town . With my competition over I was again seeing my American from the equipment shed . The remaining days of the sixteenth Olympiad went by quickly . t can not explain clearly how it happened , but two life plans became one . We told each other , " We will meet again after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 did not get home until January . We had come to Australia by plane , but we left by ship , the Soviet Gruzia . When at last we reached Vladivostok in Russia , our ship was escorted into the harbor by Soviet Navy vessels with all their flag signals up . The air was filled with the songs of a hundred sirens as we slowly pulled up to the dock . From Vladivostok the Russian , Czech and Bulgarian athletes went by train to Moscow . It is an unusual experience to travel on a trans-Siberian train in the deep of winter , when workers must steadily clear a way through five to ten feet of snow . Every few hours we stopped for the Siberiaks , a hearty people who waited for hours for the train bringing the athletes to come by their towns . " Long live the heroes , " they would cheer , and rush into the train compartments . " No time for sleeping . Come out and celebrate ! " It was around Christmas , and small trees all trimmed with sparkle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could n't disappoint such people , and for nine days around the clock we were celebrating Christmas in temperatures averaging 30 degrees below zero . Finally we arrived in Moscow . It was New Year 's Eve , and the athletes were T FIE invited to the traditional ball in the Kremlin . Five orchestras , from a symphony beginning to a jazz-band ending , played in various halls of the palace . In the middle of the laughter and excitement the door opened , and Premier Khrushchev and his guests from the government of China came in to shake hands with the Olympic athletes . After my return to Czechoslovakia I was assigned to a little job in the best orthopedic clinic in Prague . This meant very much to a medical student . I had planned originally to retire from athletics for good and concentrate purely on my studies . But something else had happened . I had fallen in love with a brave and true boy from another world . I loved my parents and could not picture leaving them . 1 loved my medical studies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted the top athlete of the year by the people in national balloting , and i received the highest sports honor in Czechoslovakia , the title of " supreme master of sports . " All this had to be left behind for a man I knew barely a month  --  a man with a different background , education and religion . He was a Catholic , while I was a Protestant . He came from the West , while I came from east of the Iron Curtain . Yet , 1 loved the man and knew that despite all these differences , our thoughts and ideals had the same direction . Perhaps the keenest insight into our relationship was to be made by the Protestant clergyman marrying us , who said , " Your backgrounds and the influences on your lives have been completely different , but the basic Christian teaching has made you one in love . " My parents were happy in the thought of my wedding , but deeply sad because it would mean thousands of miles between us . How I admired their love and // absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father after meeting my future husband , " Though I spoke so little to this boy of yours , he is good . I have no worries about you . I let him to take you . " When I had a moment of apprehension my mother said , " Olushko , nobody is getting married completely sober minded . Go after your heart 's calling . I do n't think you will get hurt . " We had three weddings in Prague : . civilian , according to Czech law , in the City Hall ; Catholic , in the unique Gothic fourteenth-century Tyn Church : and Lutheran . in St. Salvator 's Church , one of the monuments of the Protestant movement . Although the weddings were held on a working day , Wednesday morning , huge crowds of people filled the churches and the City Hall . The large Old Town Square was overflowing with a seething throng of 20,000 . I will never forget the faces of the men and women who had shown to me so much love for bringing Czechoslovakia its only gold medal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought us to a realization of the hunger for happiness and friendship among the tense nations of the world . It was all summed up best in an editorial from The New York Times of March 22 , 1957 , which was read with emotion by United States Ambassador U. Alexis Johnson to more than 100 guests at the wedding reception he gave for us at his beautiful Prague residence ; " This poor old world of ours is quarreling , divided and perplexed . . . The H-bomb overhangs us like a cloud of doom . The subway during the rush hours is almost impossible to endure , The common cold is still with us . But Olga and Harold are in love , and the world does not say no to them . Cynicism sweeps drearily across the landscapes of the earth , but Olga and Harold love each other in the way that began in the dawn of time .... " Consequently and naturally they are going to get married . Somehow this seems like a ray of light , intelligence and beauty in a world where ministers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth in search of intelligence , light and beauty and do not often find them . There should be , we think , a little quiet dancing in she streets next Wednesday . " Our honeymoon was spent in packing my clothes , my mother 's kitchen utensils 1 could n't leave behind , and an army of friends  --  my stuffed animals . On the way to taking the S. S. America to the United States we stopped in Vienna and then in Paris as the guests of the French Sports Federation . After we sailed , the ship 's officer kept reminding me for five days , " Do n't miss the Statue of Liberty . You will never forget the view as long as you live . " So on the last morning I kept watching anxiously through the thick fog . Suddenly we were attacked by a flock of noisy wild men with flashing cameras and endless questions . My sad squeaking , " Let me out to see the statue , " was smothered . We kept waving and smiling , and there was nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What a labyrinth of cement and steel was New York ! The cars seemed to be driving not only along the streets but also up and down the skyscrapers . Although we slept on the thirty-second floor of a hotel , 1 could hear horns blowing in my ears the whole night . I suppose this is a typical teeling for a foreigner entering New York City for the first time . Later he starts to differentiate among the various aspects of ( Continue , 1 from Pap . 52 ) the city , I can not wait until my way will lead that way again . I can not leave unmentioned the two main events of my first visit to New York , One was the reception given us at City Hall by the moor . the memory of which will forever remain highlighted by his vivid description of the intricate wiring system that protects the windows and ledges of the building from the pigeons . The other was our appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show and meeting this man who even remembered us two years later on the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our story came from Las Vegas and Hollywood . We chose to remain amateur athletes . My adjustment to a new society was hindered by language difficulties . If I ever thought for a minute that I knew basic English , I was totally wrong , There are funny stories about my language difficulties  --  and a heartbreaking one too . My anxiety to immediately continue medical studies caused me to sit for half a year in the Boston University , understanding but a few words of the lectures . I flunked one subject from four , and had to withdraw for a time because of absolute nervous exhaustion . With the loss of language I felt I had lost my personality . Therefore , I started to work hard on the English language  --  especially the jungle of idiomatic American expres.sions  --  to regain my confidence . My husband , an English and history teacher , supervised my study . He taught me also American tradition and the backgrounds and philosophies of the greatest men this country has produced . My favorite became Benjamin Franklin . The United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletes . That , perhaps , influenced me the most to stay in competition . However , 1 found that the general public 's opinion of competitive athletics for women  --  track and field especially  --  was , in my new homeland , as it was twenty years ago in Europe . " The hands of our girls , " a New England school principal told me , " are created to play violin . Please , do not put into their heads ideas about competition . We had recently a great fight to keep them from forming a basketball team . " " For seven years I played the violin , " I replied angrily , " and my hands were good for it as well as for winning the Olympic Games . " I had been invited by the student council to speak at an assembly in an all-girls school . I made the remarks I wanted to , and the girls cheered . The principal was politely angry . I will never forget the day when i entered the Harvard University field to practice . The baseball players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sweat suit , on the Harvard grounds ! Unbelievable ! Shocking ! Wen , it did n't take a great deal of intelligence to discover that I would have a hard time staying on the top in athletics . Here the meets in track and field for women are organized for the most part in deep seclusion , whereas in Europe the events are held in the same stadium . Moreover , in the United States the meets for women are very , very scarce . In these circumstances I found very little pleasure in throwing the discus and was about to retire . However , I met here and there individuals and groups who were trying sincerely to improve the state of women 's physical education and sports . Because of them i stayed . I hoped that my television appearances and competitive showing would help to conquer the deep prejudice . In September , 1958 , my husband found a better teaching opportunity in Santa Monica . California . and I found my dream of living under the palm trees . live minutes from u beach . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned out to be the same uninspiring affairs they were back east . Quietly I started to look for some other activity . I found fun in tennis and tried golf . " You ' night make a good golfer . after all , " mumbled the owner of a local driving range when . after about twenty misses , I finally manged to hit the ball , and it landed beyond the 250-yard mark . I did not become a golfer , because by that time I was working intensively on my first great achievement in the United States . On the first of May , 1959 , in the Santa Monica Hospital 1 delivered a big-eyed , bald-headed baby boy of eleven pounds , thirteen ounces . Time magazine reported that a son , Mark , was born to husky Olga Fikotova Connolly , the Olympic champion discus thrower . This business about me being husky was a constant annoyance , It made me feel uncomfortable . My shoulders happen to be straight and wide , and I am live-ten , but I was never considered the huge or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties when you are not the standard size . This was especially painful when there happened to be a nice sale in some dress shop . I would never fit into a dress that was on sale  --  it would either be too small for my shoulders or thighs or too big for my waist . When my baby was born  --  with my new responsibilities as a mother  --  I had to decide whether to continue in competitive sports . It was a year before the 1960 Olympic Games , and less than a year before my naturalization as a citizen of Uncle Sam . 1 took the hard way . It turned out to he harder than I thought . My routine before the 1956 Olympics was like a lawn party , compared with the one I chose for myself now . The Olympic tryouts were coming . tried to get myself as strong as possible to make up for the lost time . My 165 pounds seemed so little , compared with some other top competitors in the world , 1 set out on a strength and weight-gaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondary part of my training . I kept pushing 150 pounds over my head , squatting with 240 pounds for my legs and repeatedly picking up 260 pounds from the floor to strengthen my back . I was getting stronger , but no bigger . Yet , I wanted more weight . " Olga , you are plenty heavy . You do n't need to get any bigger to throw far. - But I did n't listen to this plea of Bruce Conner , a physical therapist who trained me in his gym . I started instead to drink quarts of milk and eat enough for three . was throwing 170 to l80 feet in practice , but as a rule I did n't do as well as I should have in the rare meets . Most of all , I guess , it was the missing spectators . Those empty stands  --  was my uncle right ? I headed for Rome weighing 178 pounds . It did n't help me a bit . My performance was below that in 1956 , 1 finished seventh . Nina Ponornareva of Russia broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 8 ' i " . In Melbourne , where I weighed only 164 pounds , I had something else that I have lost along the way : explosion and a fiery fighting spirit built up by the number of hard matches in Europe . A woman does not need to be immense to win . A number of slim . attractive European girls have done extremely well against much bigger , stronger and heavier women . Our team had one exceptional performer in the 1960 Olympic Games  --  Wilma Rudolph , the Clarksville , Tennessee , girl . She would have never become a triple gold-medal winner for the United States in Rome if she had n't attended Tennessee A. and 1. , the only college in the country which has a serious track program for women and an excellent coach to go with it . But even Tennessee A. and I. has yet to produce a champion in an event other than running . Developing top performers in the technical dis ciplines  --  like jumping or throwing  --  requires a nationwide program of clinics and competitions for the talented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the talent ? The public schools are the spawning grounds of the American male Olympic champions , but the schools are making every effort to keep hard exercises and competition for girls out of their curriculums . They want to keep American women feminine , they say . I feel that is a doubtful argument . Did n't such stars of femininity as Greta Garbo , Ingrid Bergman and Gina Lollobrigida come from Europe , where educators are not afraid to let the girls build their healthy bodies just as much as the boys do ? On my return from Rome last September I decided to try and combat the unfounded fears connected with athletic women by becoming as slim and attractive as possible . Perhaps in some small way , my example could help convince women that real exercise is good for them , as well as for their daughters . I started to work on my self-improvement . I exercised half an hour every day with my sixteen-month-old , who enjoyed himself tremendously . I canceled potatoes , noodles and spaghetti from my diet for a while . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a container of magic brown powder . " This is reputed to be quite remarkable for quick reducing , Add a quart of water and drink your pounds away , " she said . The entire day my stomach sadly moved around pieces of an extraneous , irresistible cucumber , wrapped up in a chocolate-flavored liquid . At nine P.M. I gave up . I settled the matter with three thick peanut-butter-andjelly sandwiches . I am sure the diet in the container may be useful , but l can not exist on it . So I depended mainly on will power , calorie counter and lettuce . I utilized my knowledge of nutrition to have my diet well-rounded , and to eliminate any possible error , I never skipped the daily vitamin pill . Besides an everyday tone-up at home , I worked hard every second day in a gym . The 1400 calories I allowed myself each day were less than half of what I was used to . My husband would laugh every night when I demanded a recount , hoping to find a few leftover calories for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saccharin ? " he would suggest sweetly . The dieting is over . From now on a careful eye on the scale and my daily exercise will keep me , as the athletes say , in shape . I lost thirty pounds and I now fit into a Size 12 dress . 1 lost four inches from my southern pole , two inches from my waist and no inches where I did n't want to lose . Although retired from corn-petition , 1 can still throw the discus 160 feet . What did it prove ? It proved that you can exercise very hard and not only keep your femininity but improve your appearance . It proved how right thousands of women all over the world are to be addicted to athletics , which keeps them young and attractive . If many American girls and women started to really exercise and compete in sports , it would bring such a flood of beautiful figures that the Hollywood directors would go from one nervous breakdown to another . What does the future hold for me , an ex-Olympic champion , a mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story how my plans always get twisted and turned around . However , my great desire is still to return to my medical studies , get my diploma and use it for people who need help . It will be difficult but I 've traveled hard roads before .
