txt President de Gaulle turned to the French people once more tonight with an impassioned plea for a personal vote of confidence and asserted that he would resign if he did not get it . In a 50-minute televised interview , he told the nation that there " could be not the slightest doubt " that he would step down immediately if the voters , in the referendum April 27 , turned down his proposals for regional reform and transformation of the Senate . " Here I am , submitting a solemn proposal of reform to our country , " he said . " If the French people , by chance  --  for that is the word  --  were to oppose this reform , what kind of man would I be if I failed to draw the consequences of such a profound rupture at once and ridiculously tried to maintain myself in my present functions . " The reform bill would create 22 relatively autonomous regions , including Corsica , each // a regional assembly , and would transform the Senate into a purely consultative assembly dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would no longer succeed on the President 's death . The text of the reform , which is 10,000 words long , involves modification of at least 20 of the 92 articles of the Constitution . Once more the 78-year-old general cast himself in the role of a giant who is bearing the burden of the nation 's savior and guide , not because of any personal ambition but because , of historical necessity . " One day one will measure the depth of the chasms that were spared the fatherland because the people gave me its confidence whenever I turned to it , " he said . He recalled that through 30 years he had taken exceptional risks when the destiny of the nation was in the balance , but that he had never failed to submit to its judgment . He did not say so , but this obviously was his strongly felt answer to the opposition 's frequent charge that he has embraced dictatorial ways .

" On all these occasions , because I had confidence in the nation , I asked it to have confidence in me , " the President said . Then , turning straight toward the camera and stretching his hands forward in an imploring gesture , he added : " This time once more I put the question before Frenchwomen and Frenchmen . It is necessary to say yes ' to a great reform in order to push back the threats that are hanging over France . " For the program , taped at Elysee Palace this morning , he was sitting in his study with Michel Droit , a Gaullist editor , who posed nine general questions , permitting General de Gaulle to address himself to the principal aspects of the referendum .

It is almost generally assumed that the Government will win a majority , though the margin may be narrow . While the campaign officially opens Wednesday , Government officials have been hard at work . So far the efforts seem to have failed to shake the country out of its indifference . Twenty-five per cent of the voters intend to say yes and 23 per cent no , according to a poll published by the French Public Opinion Institute . The remaining 52 per cent either intended to abstain or said they were undecided , the poll found . This represents a gain of a percentage point for the Government over the previous poll , 10 days ago . The poll showed what everybody knr'ws  --  that the overwhelming majority will cast their votes simply for or against the Gaullist regime . Many Frenchmen are more or less unhappy with the regime but they do not wish to see the general leave .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
