" Share the guilt " seems to be the theatrical slogan of the hour . The Man in the Glass Booth asks playgoers to share guilt for the massacre of the Jews . The Great White Hope asks playgoers to share guilt for the oppression of the Negro . Both are dramas of contrition with little internal life ; they would scarcely stir , except for the borrowed adrenaline of newspaper headlines , past history , and the emotional sympathies of the already converted . For the price of a mea culpa , the audience is made to feel good by feeling bad . <P> The Great White Hope , by Howard Sackler , is a sprawling , episodic semi-documentary that traces the rise and fall of Jack Johnson , the first Negro heavyweight champion of the world . In the play he is called Jack Jefferson , and James Earl Jones roars through the role with the jungle magnetism and pride of a lion . In a concentrated off-Broadway apprenticeship , Jones often played a kind of jolly brown giant ; here he plays an avenging black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buries himself in a part . Instead , he devours the part and then radiates its presence in him . <P> From the time that Jefferson becomes champion , he appears to threaten and diminish the white world , in and out of boxing . Corrupt promoters begin scurrying around for a " great white hope " to restore racial supremacy . Full of arrogant self-regard and a casual contempt for blacks as well as whites , Jefferson all too easily stokes the hostility of his foes . <P> His subtlest and most infuriating affront is sexual . He loves a white girl , who lives and travels with him as his common-law wife . Jane Alexander invests this role with the tenderness , passion and loyalty of a star-crossed Desdemona . When Jefferson is convicted of a Mann Act charge , he jumps bail and flees to Europe . A hounded exile , he drifts from country to country , reaching a kind of symbolic degradation when he shuffles through the role of Uncle Tom in a Budapest cafe and is booed . Still , he rejects a standing offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his jail sentence . Broody , badgered and in a kind of psychic agony , he finally turns on his white woman as the symbol of all his woes and throws her out . In a sequence of tear-jerking melodrama rather than honest emotional power , she commits suicide . Cowed and crushed , Jefferson accedes to his arranged defeat in Havana . <P> The play has the aspect of a minor saga , but Edwin Sherin has directed it like a stampede : all decibels and no deftness . Either everyone shouts , or everyone postures in animated tableaux that look like posters left over from some social-protest movement of the ' 30s . Ostensibly pro-Negro , the play peculiarly caters to the stereotyped image of the Negro as forever singing , dancing , fighting , drinking and wenching . As for the question of racial injustice , the play provides a kind of false catharsis . It is the equivalent of appointing a congressional committee to investigate an air crash . It eases the conscience without facing the tragedy .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
