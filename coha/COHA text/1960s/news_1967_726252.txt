txt George , S. Moore was elected president of ? . the Metropolitan Opera ? Association yesterday , replacing Anthony A. Bliss . Mr. Moore 's election followed rumors in music circles for . several weeks that Mr. Bliss was going to be replaced . Mr. Bliss , who had held the post fol. 11 years , will continue as a member of . the , Metropolitan 's board and executive committee . Mr. Moore , president of the First National City Bank , has been . a board member .. and 1958 . His term a0 president began yesterday after the vote at the board 's annual meeting , held at the opera house in Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts . Mr. Moore , in a telephone interview , denied : that the Met 's recent financial problems were a factor in the replacement of Mr. Bliss . He said : ' " I 've been working very actively with the " opera for ! diet . years. , It 's been a team effort . " He would not discuss the reasons for the change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a two-page statement issued last evening by Francis Robinson , an assistant manager . Mr. Moore was ' unopposed and was elected unanimously . He had been selected by the board 's nominating committee , which met four weeks ago . Their choice was circulated to the 37-member board three weeks before yesterday 's session to afford an opportunity for other names to be entered . Authoritative sources ' close to the Met 's board noted three factors that contributed to Mr. Bliss 's replacement by Mr. Moore  --  labor relations , the ballet and the national company of the opera . In the first , Mr. Bliss 's negotiations with the Met musicians that led to a brief strike before the opening of this season were felt to be too " soft " in contrast to a view on the part of other Met management that a harder line should have been taken with the orchestra . The five-year agreement with the musicians , announced on opening night last September , for which ' the union had granted its members a waiver to perform , raised the average base pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Proponent of Ballet Mr. Bliss had been a stanch proponent of improving the stature of the opera 's ballet troupe . He felt that the ballet should become more equal with the opera . Others in the Met management have argued that such a goal ' can be realized over the years only with a considerable outlay of money . The outgoing president had also , favored maintenance of the Met 's national company . The company finished its first season recently with a deficit of more than $1-million , and it was decided to suspend operations for next season . Others on the board felt that the opera 's money and energy should be concentrated on the company in New York . The move to the $45.7-million opera house in Lincoln Center brought with it a severe financial crisis . Last November the Met decided to raise the price of tickets , the first time it had ever clone so in midseason . The top ticket went from $13 to $15.50 , and other seat prices were increased about 20 per cent . Season subscribers were asked ? to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their subscriptions . Mr. Bliss and Mr. Moore both spoke in gloomy terms of the financial position . The Met had estimated that costs in its new home wound be $14-million a-year , or $3-million more than those for the old house . Instead , increased labor costs for more backstage employes , and breakdowns in new equipment raised the opening-season figure to $17-million . As a result , the company found that it needed $5.4-million instead of the $3.7-million it had , anticipated to make up the deficit that would be incurred even after all , its tickets were sold . Back on the Track ' In the Met 's statement , Lauder Greenway , re - elected as board chairman , said : " We temporarily lost control of our costs . We are happy to report that things are now back on the right track . " - " We adopted a revised laudg- et on Nov. 1 , including ' actual expenses to that date and projections for the : balance of the current season , " Mr. Greenway said . " We have operated within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deviation from that budget since that date . " Asked to comment upon the change , Rudolf Bing , general manager of the Met , said : " I am not a member of the board . I am a loyal servant of the board and had extremely happy years with Mr. Bliss , who was outstandingly successful . He had the distinction of leading the company to the new house . " However , some sources reported that in recent years Mr. Bliss had been in disagreement with Mr. Bing on a number of issues , among them the operation of the Met 's ballet company and the national company , both of which Mr. Bliss strongly favored . Mr. Bliss , a member of the law firm of Milbank , Tweed , Hadley &; McCloy , was not available for comment last night . Despite the Met 's financial headaches , some observers were reluctant to link these to Mr. Moore 's election . They pointed out that a &; treasurer , Mr. Moore has had a prominent role in these matters . ' Mr. Moore , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At yesterday 's meeting , Mr. Greenway officially confirmed to the board earlier announcements that the opera has exercised its option on Mr. Bing 's services as general manager through the 1969-70 season . Mr. Greenway told the board that this action " should put to rest unwarranted rumors about any present change in our general managership . " " I would like once more to call attention to the unstinting devotion and talent of Mr. Bing , who , during this most trying year , has succeeded in maintaining the traditionally high standards of the Metropolitan , " Mr. Greenway said . At the meeting , Mr. Moore 's post as treasurer was given to Gordon M. Hill , who had been assistant treasurer . James Jaffray , a board ' member , was elected assistant treasurer . ' mind= Van Norden was elected secretary and Herman E. Krawitz , ' who had served as secretary , was elected assistant secretary . He is also an assist-I ant manager .

In addition to Mr. Bliss , the members of the executive committee , which guides the opera 's policies , are Walker G. Buckner , John W. Drye Jr. , Francis Geelet , William Rockefeller , Grant G. Simmons Jr . and Royall Victor Jr . Charles M. Spofford , who has been ill , continues as executive committee chairman . Mr. Moore is 61 years old , a Yale man and a Republican . He became president of the First National City Bank in 1959 . A man of widespread interests , he has debated Inca . economics with John Kenneth Galbraith . In 1965 , Mr. Moore caused a furor when he resigned as chairman of the financial advisory committee of the New York World 's Fair in a disagreement over financial policies with Robert Moses , the fair 's president .

He was one of the ' group that strongly urged building a new home for the Met.
