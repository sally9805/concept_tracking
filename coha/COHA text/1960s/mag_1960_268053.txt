The original of the passage quoted on page 56 : <P> So he bent down , put his head into the hole , and called out : <P> " Is anybody at home ? " <P> There was a sudden scuffling noise from inside the hole , and then silence . <P> " What I said was , ' Is anybody at home ? ' " called out Pooh very loudly . <P> " No ! " said a voice ; and then added , " You need n't shout so loud , I heard you quite well the first time . " <P> " Bother , " said Pooh . " Is n't there anybody here at all ? " <P> " Nobody . " <P> Winnie-the-Pooh took his head out of the hole , and thought for a little , and he thought to himself , <P> " There must be somebody there , because somebody must have said ' Nobody . ' " So he put his head back in the hole , and said : <P> " Hallo , Rabbit , is n't that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a different sort of voice this time . <P> " But is n't that Rabbit 's voice ? " <P> " I do n't think so , " said Rabbit . " It is n't meant to be . " <P> " Oh ! " said Pooh . <P> He took his head out of the hole , and had another think , and then he put it back , and said : <P> " Well , could you very kindly tell me where Rabbit is ? " <P> " He has gone to see his friend Pooh Bear , who is a great friend of his . " <P> " But this is Me ! " said Bear , very much surprised . <P> " What sort of Me ? " <P> " Pooh Bear . " <P> " Are you quite sure ? " said Rabbit , still more surprised . <P> " Quite , quite sure , " said Pooh . <P> " Oh , well , then , come in. "               @ @ @ @ @ @
