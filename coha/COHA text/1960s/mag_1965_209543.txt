ABC has long played third fiddle to NBC and CBS . Although it has sales of $421 million and operates 401 movie theaters , it has not had the plentiful cash with which its rivals dominate the TV screen . But last week the word at ABC was money-lots of it . After a year of dickering , the International Telephone &; Telegraph Co. ( 1964 sales : $1.5 billion ) agreed to acquire ABC in a move that , if it goes through as expected , will produce a new **25;408;TOOLONG colossus . The combination would outrank Radio Corp . of America ( 1964 sales : $1.8 billion ) and its NBC subsidiary , leave CBS as the only major network without a big corporate shelter. * <P> Chopped Down . The proposed merger by stock swap , which must be approved by the stockholders and will probably receive more than the normal amount of scrutiny in Washington , is the work of Harold S. Geneen , I. T. &; T. 's hard-driving president since 1959 . When he took over I. T. &; T. , Geneen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ailing giant would become " one of the most important companies of the next decade . " <P> To turn his fancy into fact , Geneen chopped down a somnolent executive hierarchy and tightened Manhattan-headquarters control over I. T. &; T. 's global spread ( 195,000 employees , 27s factories and offices in 52 countries ) . He also became one of the corporate world 's most expansion-minded executives . He has made 35 acquisitions , including an auto-rental company ( Avis ) and a mutual-fund management company ( Hamilton ) , has moved into heating and ventilating equipment , consumer finance and life insurance . One result : the doubling of both I. T. &; T. 's sales and its profits ( $63 million ) . <P> The I. T. &; T.-ABC merger should bring big benefits to both companies . I. T. &; T. gets the bulk of its income from its activities as a major world supplier of telephone and electronic equipment and services and as a big producer in Europe of TV sets , refrigerators and record players . The new combine would end that heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autonomous " subsidiary headed by President Leonard H. Goldenson , 60 , would get from the merger the needed financial resources with which to build stronger programs . <P> Delighted Simon . The merger would also end any chance of a takeover by ABC 's largest stockholder , Norton Simon , the West Coast industrialist . Simon , in fact , seems delighted . One reason : he already has a $17 million paper profit on the 9.9% of ABC common stock held by his Hunt Foods and Mc-Call Corp . <P> The tie-up could also speed satellite communications for ABC radio and television . A major stockholder in Comsat , I. T. &; T. last month asked approval from the Federal Communications Commission to build and operate a satellite earth station in Puerto Rico , where it runs the telephone system . The station would connect the U.S. , Europe and Latin America with live TV , telephone and other services . <P> <P> * NBC 's news of the week was the departure of President Robert Kintner , 56 , who was scheduled to move up to board chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no unofficial leak . The reasons , presumably , were personal .
