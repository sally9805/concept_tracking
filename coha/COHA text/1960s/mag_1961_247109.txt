Last week the best-known Baptist in the world , Evangelist Billy Graham , was in a controversy with some members of his own church over what they considered his un-Baptist views on baptism . <P> The fundamental distinguishing belief of Baptists is that baptism should be administered only to believers as a sign and symbol of their conversion-not as a means of grace , or cleansing from sin , or a setting apart , as with other forms of Christianity . The corollary to the Baptist tenet is that infants are too young to believe and therefore must not be baptized . Yet in an interview in the biweekly Lutheran Standard , official publication of the 2,300,000-member American Lutheran Church . Graham was quoted as saying : " I still have some personal problems in this matter of infant baptism , but all of my children with the exception of the youngest were baptized as infants . I do believe that something happens at the baptism of an infant , particularly if the parents are Christians and teach their children Christian truths from childhood . We can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a miracle can happen in these children so that they are regenerated , that is , made Christian , through infant baptism . " <P> " Strange thoughts , these . ' ' editorialized the Washington weekly Capital Baptist . " We do not believe in baptismal regeneration for adults , who are supposed to know what they are doing , much less for infants ... If Graham really believes the things he is quoted as saying , he probably has started the biggest controversy that Baptists have had for many a moon . " <P> At week 's end , Graham said he deplored the controversy , and felt that the Lutheran Standard had " misinterpreted several statements I made . " His children , he explained , were baptized at the age of 9 and 10 by their own choice in the Presbyterian faith of their mother . Describing his as " an ecumenical family , " Convinced Baptist Graham said that while he respects the opinions of those who have different views on baptism " my personal convictions are those of my denomination .
