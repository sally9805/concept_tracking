Britain 's deflationary policy may be turning out to be all too stringent . Through high taxes and credit restrictions , Prime Minister Harold Wilson is trying to reduce consumer spending and raise exports and investments . But Wilson realizes that it is hard to cut consumer spending without simultaneously drying up investment-because in large part , investment is a response to demand . The country , headlined the Guardian , appears to be HEADING FOR A DEEP RECESSION . <P> So far , the main effect of the three-month-old Wilson squeeze has been to pinch vital private capital investment much harder than most Britons had expected . The government 's Board of Trade last week predicted that investment will drop 7% or 8% next year . The Confederation of British Industry expects an even worse fall-15% to 25% during the next twelve months . <P> Capital for investment is becoming scarcer because of Wilson 's extraordinary Selective Employment Tax ( TIME , Sept. 16 ) . By forcing employers to pay a frankly discriminatory head tax on workers in the service trades and giving tax rebates to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift British workers out of areas that serve the consumer and into those that serve the pound . The tax is siphoning cash out of corporate treasuries at an annual rate of $2 billion , which is about one-fourth the amount that private industry normally invests in capital improvements . One other result of the deflationary policy has been a jump in unemployment , which rose last month by 100,000 , to 370,000 . Reflecting some Britons ' fears of depression-style mass layoffs , one cartoonist drew a portly Wilson in a wide-lapelled 1930 suit with a breadline in the background . At the same time , the Labor government 's spending has expanded despite Wilson 's promise of restraint . In September , public-housing starts topped private housing 18,000 to 14,900 . By the second half of 1967 , predicts the London and Cambridge Economic Bulletin , public capital spending will exceed private capital investment , $3.70 billion to $3.65 billion , thus giving nationalized industry predominance in the British economy for the first time . The decline of demand , employment and profits has eroded investor confidence . Prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , down 22% since June . The pound , too , slipped on world money markets , and the Bank of England had to come to its aid once more with support purchasing .
