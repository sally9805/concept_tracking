FOLKSINGERS <P> In Portugal , Amlia Rodrigues is considered the world 's greatest singer . When she sings on television , theaters empty ; there are fist fights in the cafs , and worried queues leading to the squares that have public television sets . At 43 , she is everything to Lisbon that Edith Piaf was to Paris , and because she is a singer of fados , she is also considered a liberator , a philosopher , an antagonist , a revolutionary . <P> She is , in fact , a kind of savior . When she became a fadista in the late ' 30s , the fados were in bad flower because of their unpleasant exaltation of poverty , disease and death . Amlia , reeking of pathos , rescued the art of the fado by lifting its emotional sights to the level of pain , nostalgia and despair . Such suffering is delicious to the Portuguese , and the fados cover everything-defeated souls , wasted nights , strange shadows . Americans who have a feeling for the blues can understand the spirit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've felt the fado . <P> Bed &; Bullfights . Fados sound like torch songs sung from the top of a mosque : sobs , wails , cries from the soul . Even when performed by as dulcet a fadista as Amlia , they are more forlorn than a foghorn , more despairing than a moan . Fado means destiny in Portuguese , and the Weltschmerz of a good fado gets a physical grip on its audience ; like " ffillie Holiday 's blues , fados encourage a state of mind well beyond the reach of popular music . <P> Some scholars hear in fados " the sweet crying " of African slave songs or Gregorian chants . By the 18th century , Portuguese sailors were singing the sad songs to prostitutes , who sang them to aristocrats and other opinion makers . The first great fadista was Maria Severa , a gypsy prostitute who sang in a low-life casa do fado in the 1830s . She devoted her 26 dissolute years to bed and bullfights , wine and fado , and her legend is so much with the Portuguese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Ashes &; Fire . Portuguese love the fado most when they are away from Portugal ; saudade , an untranslatable word that means something like galloping nostalgia , occurs in nearly every song . But even at home , the Portuguese seem eager to have their hearts broken . " A wild group of students can roar into a tavern , " a medical student says wonderingly , " and immediately they become despondent , wailing their favorite fado . " Positive-thinking Portuguese try unsuccessfully to combat this downbeat sense of life ; if such songs must be sung , a Portuguese intellectual has urged , " let us suffer en famille and avoid letting foreigners think we have invented a new kind of yawn . " <P> Fado 's dark charms are , indeed , perceivable beyond Portugal . Amlia has sung in New York and Hollywood , made a dozen successful visits to Bra zil and just finished a triumphant engagement in Mexico City . But back home , her spell is so strong that she easily persuades Portugal 's leading intellectuals and composers to write songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of the dejected lovers and sentimental ladies who anonymously contribute most fado lyrics .
