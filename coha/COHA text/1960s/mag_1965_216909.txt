Latest bench mark on U.S. manners and morals : <P> Dr. Roswell Johnson , director of health services at Brown University and its women 's college , Pembroke , last week acknowledged that he had prescribed birth-control pills for " a very , very small " number of girls ( perhaps as many as five ) in his official capacity . The girls were over 21 and intending to be married . He emphasized that he had had lengthy consultations in each case , because " I want to feel I 'm contributing to a solid relationship and not to unmitigated promiscuity . " <P> Brown President Barnaby Keeney stoutly backed his health director . Dr. Johnson 's position , said Keeney , " implies discretion to treat cases as seems best to him . After examination of the circumstances , he decided to prescribe contraceptive pills . It is common practice to do so before marriage . "
