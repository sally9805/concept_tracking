Boola Boola , Babe Ruth , and a Jug of Whiskey Sours A story by Milton White Ikeep , among my Yale memorabilia , the New York Times Sunday sports section for November 20 , 1932 . The paper carries complete coverage of the Yale-Harvard game played the preceding day in one of the worst rainstorms in New Haven 's history . Walter Levering ran 45 yards for a touchdown in the first period . Pat Sullivan earned the extra point when he carried the ball across on an ingenious run after finding it impossible to put the slippery ball in position for Curtin to kick from placement . Levering ran 55 yards for another touchdown in the third : and the last touchdown came on a 24-yard fourth-down pass from Lassiter to Marting on the first play of the final period . Yale beat Harvard , 19 to 0 , the most decisive victory over the Crimson in thirty years . I keep the copy of the sports section primarily because of a small news item on Page 4 , following the detailed account of the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downpour with Mrs. Ruth until even his massive physique could not stand it any longer . He left in the fourth quarter totally unnoticed . He was just another bedraggled figure heading for the exits . " I have no quibble with the New York Times , but their report is inaccurate , and for a long time I meant to write to the editor . The truth is / noticed Babe Ruth leave the Yale - Bowl . I sat next to him throughout most of the game . He invited me to share his gallon jug of whiskey sours . Marge Fulton missed all of that . Marge was to be my date for the game . Her father arranged it . early in November . I remember that I was walking back to Fayerweather after Freshman English class ( Henry IV , Part I ) when I saw Mr. Fulton , who is from Springfield , my hometown , step out of a taxicab on Elm Street . Mr. Fulton hailed me , hurried toward me , and at the same time looked back , signaling the driver to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bespectacled , and weighed only eighty-eight pounds . Mr. Fulton , tall , pot-bellied , with an enormous shock of white hair , seized my hand and pumped it . " What luck ! " he shouted at me . " I stopped over on my way back from New York just to see you . " He clapped me on the shoulder . " So you 're a freshman at Yale ! " he cried , sweeping his hand in the direction of the Old Campus . You look all settled in . " He glanced up at the windows of the dormitories around Berkeley Oval and lowered his voice . " I might as well come to the point . " he said . " How would you like to invite Margie to the Yale-Harvard game ? Send her a letter . You do n't have to say anything about my seeing you . And do n't worry about the expense . I 'll send you a check in a few days . " " Well , " I said , embarrassed . I stared across the street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Fulton had five daughters  --  but I really liked Marge . I had taken her to my senior prom at Central High School . " I 'll write Marge , " I said , " but you do n't have to send me a check . " Mr. Fulton held up his hand . " I know how things are at home with your Dad . I 'll send you fifteen dollars . I just want you and Margie to have a good time . Okay ? Fine ! " He looked down at me , clapped me on the shoulder , and tugged me along with him to the taxicab . " You do n't have to send me any money ! " cried , as the taxicab pulled away , but Mr. Fulton only winked . At that time of morning most of Yale was in class . Berkeley Oval was quiet . The bright November sunlight pointed up the soot in the aged red brick of the buildings surrounding the open courtyard  --  White , Berkeley , Lampoon , Haughton , and Fayerweather  --  al doomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . " Aprs nous , le deluge , " we freshmen said . As I stared at the morning sunlight on the red-brick Round House near the entrance to the Oval and at the six bare trees in the courtyard , it occurred to me that a fellow had only four Yale-Harvard games to attend in his lifetime as Milton White teaches English at Miami University in Oxford , Ohio , where he took , his A.B . and M.A. degrees . He attended Yale for one year as a member of the Class of 1936 . His novel , " Listen , the Red-eyed Vireo , " came out in 1961. an undergraduate . I probably could n't afford to go to the games played in Cambridge ; that left me only the two games in New Haven . I pushed open the door to the suite I shared with Mike Sayles . Mike stepped out of his bedroom wearing a shining new raccoon coat that reached almost to his ankles . He also wore a black derby . " Snazzy , eh ? " he said , smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone Mike 's age wearing a derby . " I think I have a date for the Yale-Harvard game , " I said to Mike . " Swell . We 'll have a party , " Mike said . He 'd already invited his girl , Jan Browning , down from Smith for the game . In a burst of enthusiasm I said , " I 'll pay for the gin if you get it . " Mike knew a bootlegger on Temple Street . " We 'll split , " Mike said . That night Mike and Art Keyes went to the Paramount to see Trouble in Paradise with Miriam Hopkins and Herbert Marshall and Kay Francis . I liked Lubitsch 's movies , but I did n't go . Instead I put thirty-five cents in an empty Lucky Strike tobacco tin and stayed in my room and read Plautus . Somehow I had the feeling that Mr. Fulton would forget to send a check . ( I never did get one . ) For the next two weeks I saved every cent I could . Roxanne , the musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Lyon Phelps recommended it , but I did n't go . On Sundays , when Commons was closed , I ate only one meal : at eleven o'clock in the morning I went to the Waldorf Cafeteria on Chapel Street and ordered bacon and eggs and home-fried potatoes , then around six o'clock I ate an apple . That carried me until Monday morning when Commons opened . I had just one letter from Marge , accepting my invitation to the game . She said she 'd arrive in New Haven at 10:40 A.M. on Saturday , the nineteenth . She added that she 'd arranged to stay overnight with her aunt , who lived out near the Yale Bowl . On the Saturday of the Yale-Harvard game , after breakfast at Commons , I trudged through the rain to the La Belle Florists , way down Chapel Street a couple of blocks past Woolworth 's . Earlier in the week I 'd arranged with the lady florist who worked there to pick up a white chrysanthemum for only thirty-five cents . The rain dripped from my slicker as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue and white rihbon onto the chrysanthemum . " Beautiful ! " she said , holding up the corsage. 72 BOOLA BOOLA , BABE RUTH , AND A JUG OF WHISKEY SOURS The chrysanthemum looked small to me , but I did n't say anything . The rain , when I stepped outside , had turned into a downpour . I debated whether to take a trolley car back to the campus , decided against it , and trotted across town , holding the box with Marge 's corsage under my slicker . When I arrived at Fayerweather I found a telegram under the door . Marge had wired that she was fighting the grippe , but she 'd try to get to New Haven , anyway . I was to meet the 10:40 train . " Oh , fine ! " I said to the bowl of guppies on the mantel . The 10:40 was posted ten minutes late . Rain swept across the platform as I waited for Marge 's train to arrive . At eleven o'clock I walked back into the station and stood in the wet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a white-haired lady carrying a Pomeranian that to get to Port Chester the lady would have to take the train coming in on Track 6 and then change to a local at Stamford . The station smelled of wet wool and chewing gum . The attendant told me at last that the train would be thirty-three minutes late . Track 6 , when I returned to it , was packed with Yale men waiting , glaring up at the rain . I had to stand at the edge of the platform , out from under the roof . By the time the Springfield train swung into sight around the bend , my trousers were soaked from the rain , and the cardboard box containing Marge 's chrysanthemum had become soggy . The fellows on the platform stepped back as the train steamed past us , then they pushed forward , peering into the coach windows . The platform exploded into frantic waving and shouting , bodies thudding , heads ducking the rain . I saw Mrs. Fulton , Marge 's mother , climb out of a coach near the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carried an overnight case . My heart sank as I elbowed my way through the crowd toward her . Mrs. Fulton , a round , ruddy woman in a black coat with a huge fox collar , saw me and raised a pudgy hand . " Margie could n't come ! Grippe ! " she cried . " I 've come instead . " " Oh , " I said . I handed her the chrysanthemum . " How sweet ! " Mrs. Fulton said . Two nuns under a large black umbrella stopped beside us . One of them leaned forward , tapped me on the shoulder , and told me that she was Sister Theresa . Her companion was Sister of the Nativity . " We have suitcases back in the coach , and it 's impossible to find a porter , " she said . Rain dribbled from her umbrella onto my head . " You 're dripping rain , Sister Theresa , " said Sister of the Nativity . I thought she looked like Lillian Gish wearing steel-rimmed glasses . Mrs. Fulton nodded of the nuns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . pushing me . Sister of the Nativity led me up the aisle of the coach . " Perhaps Sister Theresa and I should have asked someone else , " she said , looking back at me . She pointed to two enormous Gladstone bags on the overhead rack . " I can manage , " I said . Sister of the Nativity spread a copy of the Springfield Republican on the seat . I climbed up , lifted one of the suitcases off the rack , and tumbled into the aisle . My cap fell off . The man in the seat ahead sprang to his feet . With a sigh , he reached up to the rack , lifted off the remaining suitcase , and handed it to me . Sister of the Nativity cleared the aisle for me . I staggered after her , lugging the two Gladstone bags . Mrs. Fulton and Sister Theresa stood far down on the platform under Sister Theresa 's black umbrella , chatting . Mrs. Fulton peeked out from under the umbrella . " Here he comes , " she called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow the Pomeranian , its leash trailing free , to dart past her . The white-haired Port Chester lady hurried along the platform calling , " Fanfan ! Fanfan ! " The Pomeranian skidded to a halt beside me , looked up , barked twice at me , and sank its teeth into the cuff of my trousers . " Good heavens ! " cried Sister of the Nativity . " Naughty ! " the Port Chester lady cried , pull-ing Fanfan from me . The cuff of my trousers ripped . The lady pressed Fanfan to her breast . " He 's never done that before ! " she said , frowning at me accusingly . Fanfan licked her cheek , then barked at me . Mrs. Fulton and Sister Theresa hurried forward , mumbling sympathy . The Port Chester lady glanced at the blue and white ribbon on Mrs. Fulton 's corsage , and turned to me . " Are you Yale ? " she cried . " Oh , I am sorry . " At the corner of College and Elm , Mrs. Fulton and I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railroad station  --  and , thoroughly drenched , we ran along Elm Street toward Berkeley Oval . A couple of white petals fluttered from the chrysanthemum on Mrs. Fulton 's shoulder . In the entry to Fayerweather I tripped on the torn cuff of my trousers . Art Keyes , a towel over his shoulder , had come into the corridor on his way to the lavatory . I saw him glance at me , then at Mrs. Fulton . I shrugged and closed the door to the suite behind me . " So this is Yale , " Mrs. Fulton said , survey-73 ing the study . " Somehow I thought it would be fancier . " She stared at the bowl of guppies on the mantel and the Yale 1936 banner on the wall . " You could call it homey , " she said . She draped her coat over a chair , slipped out of her shoes , and examined her wet stockings . " Gin ? " I asked , pointing nonchalantly to the two bottles on the table . " There 's grapefruit juice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have whiskey ? " Mrs. Fulton asked . " Well , gin will do . " She competently opened a bottle , poured gin generously into the tumbler I handed her , and added a dash of grapefruit juice . " There , " she said , sipping . The shout " Fiiiyer ! Fiiiyer ! " resounded at that moment throughout Berkeley Oval . " What in the world ! " Mrs. Fulton cried . Glass in hand , she hastened toward the rain-streaked window and looked out at the two fellows and their girl friends dashing past in the rain , on their way to Haughton . The gin had warmed me . " It 's the sex-crazed onga-onga crying for its mate , " I explained to Mrs. Fulton . " When any young female passes through Berkeley Oval , all the fellows lean out the dormitory windows and yell ' Fire . ' It 's a tradition . " I threw open the window , stuck my head out into the rain , and yelled " Fiiiyer ! " " The onga-onga ? " Mrs. Fulton said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fulton frowned , then shrugged , walked back to the table , and refilled her glass . She picked up her overnight case . " My stockings are wet . I 'll have to change , " she said . She looked down at the torn cuff of my trousers . " I 'll sew up that tear for you . " Icould hear Mrs. Fulton humming behind the closed door of my bedroom as she sewed the rip in my trousers . Staring out at the rain , I shifted my position on the study window seat so that my bathrobe covered my bare feet  --  I was drying my shoes and socks on the radiator . For want of anything better to do , I padded across the study and fed the guppies on the mantel . The cry " Fiiiyer ! " echoed once again in the Oval . " To the window , man ! " Mrs. Fulton shouted to me , through the closed door of the bedroom . Dutifully I flung open the window , wrapped my robe tight over my chest , leaned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Yale man and his date who dashed past . A taxicab pulled up to the curb on Elm Street and I saw my roommate , Mike Sayles , step out and start running toward Fayerweather . As he leaped up the entry steps , he saw me leaning out the window in my bathrobe . He looked startled . " My roommate 's coming , " I shouted to Mrs. Fulton . Mike burst in and stopped short in the center of the study . " Hey ! " I said to him . " I 'm finished ! " Mrs. Fulton called , She opened the bedroom door and stepped into the study , smiling at Mike , holding my trousers out to me . " This is Marge 's mother , for heaven 's sake , " I said . I added quickly , " A dog bit me at the railroad station . At least he ripped my trousers . " " I see , " Mike said . He inspected the two bottles of gin , and tucked the unopened bottle under his arm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For heaven 's sake , " I said . I stalked into the bedroom to put on my trousers . Mike called to me , urging me to hurry : they were going to have lunch at the Taft  --  Jan had reserved a table  --  and after lunch they were all going to listen to the football game on the radio in Bill Cailsen 's room . Bill was a junior , with a room in Branford . " No one 's going out to the Bowl , " Mike said . I opened the bedroom door . " I 'm going to the game , " I said . " In this downpour ? " Mike asked . Mrs. Fulton sighed , lifted the depleted bottle of gin , and poured herself a drink . " It 's misherable outside , " she said . Mike left a minute later . I watched him climb into the taxicab where Jan Browning waited . Mrs. Fulton stood beside me at the window , sipping her drink . " You 're missing a good time with your young friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , AND A JUG OF WHISKEY SOURS " Fiiiyer ! Fiiiyer ! " shouted a fellow from a window in Berkeley . Mrs. Fulton chuckled . Suddenly she turned on her heel , hurried to the door leading out to the corridor , and disappeared . By the time I stepped into the corridor , a commotion had already broken out in the lavatory . Mrs. Fulton , beaming , emerged , clutching two rolls of paper . Art Keyes , dripping from his shower , a towel wrapped around his midriff , peeked out the lavatory , his face incredulous . As Mrs. Fulton hurried past me , she chuckled again . She threw open the window in the study , leaned out , and yelled " Fiiiyer ! " at two girls running across the Oval . Then , leaning far forward out the window , she sent a roll of tissue sailing high into the air . The tissue caught in the branch of a tree . The roll unfurled soggily in the rain . Voices across the Oval cheered . Mrs. Fulton shouted " Fiiiyer ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With horror , I heard the increase of intensity in the cries echoing throughout the Oval . A barrage of tissue soared from the windows of Berkeley , White , Fayerweather , and Haughton . Rain plastered the tissue against the bare branches of the trees in the yard . Mrs. Fulton lifted her glass in a gesture that encompassed all of Yale , then flung the glass into the Oval . The fellows leaning out the dormitory windows cheered her . Mrs. Fulton stepped back into the room and smiled at me . " There ! " she said . Five minutes later we stood on Elm Street , dodging the spray of the taxicabs that sped past us , unheeding our signals . Mrs. Fulton held a soaked copy of the Yale Daily News over her head . " You 're too timid ! " she shouted at me , over the downpour . A taxicab turned the corner at College Street . Mrs. Fulton stepped into the road and held up her hand . I caught the surprised look on the driver 's face as he slammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taxicab and smiled at the two men in the back seat . " Are you Yale ? " she asked . " You wo n't mind dropping me off at my sister 's , will you ? " Without waiting for an answer she took her overnight case from me and climbed into the taxicab ; then she leaned out and shook my hand . " It 's been glorious ! " she said . " Now , go and join your friends , have a wonderful time . " She slammed shut the door and lowered the window . " Fiiiyer ! " she cried , and the taxicab pulled away . The bells in Harkness Tower tolled the hour . Determinedly , I sloshed across the campus to Chapel Street , rain dripping off the brim of my cap , streaking my glasses . In the Waldorf Cafeteria I gulped down a dish of macaroni andcheese and a glass of milk . I trudged through the rain again to the nearest trolley stop and boarded a trolley car marked Yale Bowl . The car was empty . Rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far in back and tried to look out at the streets of New Haven ( I 'm on my way to the Yale-Harvard game , I told myself ) , but I could hardly see through the rain and steam that covered the windows . At the end of the trolley line , soaked , I sloshed the remaining blocks to the Yale Bowl , hating the smell of wet wool . The Bowl lay surrounded by a sea of mud and water . The people around me. hurrying toward the ramps , wore slickers , rubber boots , sheepskin coats , and ponchos fashioned out of dime-store oilcloth , and they talked about rain , rain , rain . Ten minutes before game time the Bowl seemed almost deserted . Wide pools of water covered the empty playing field . Most of the spectators had ignored their seat reservations and were huddled together in a section on the 50-yard line . I found myself all alone in the center of a section of seats on the 30-yard line . I could hear the rain beating down on my slicker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember my first Yale-Harvard game like that , so I edged my way through the empty rows of benches toward the 50-yard line . I sat by myself a few feet away from most of the crowd . In the row behind me a man and woman seated on the aisle held a large piece of linoleum over their heads as protection against the rain . The man beckoned . " Come on over , " he called to me . " You do n't want to sit alone ! " I climbed over the bench and moved across the aisle . The couple smiled up at me from under the linoleum . The man was Babe Ruth , He looked just like all the pictures I 'd ever seen of him . At that moment , heads lowered against the rain , the Yale and Harvard teams sloshed onto the playing field . The crowd stomped and cheered . The Yale Band struck up " Boola Boola . " " Sit down . Have a drink , " Babe Ruth said to me , over the sound of the cheering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Ruth shifted the piece of linoleum so that part of it covered me , too . Babe Ruth lifted a gallon jug from under the bench , poured something that looked like a whiskey sour into a paper cup , and handed it to me . " To Eli Yale . " he said . My hand was shaking . " Eli Yale , " I said . Babe Ruth grinned at me and raised his paper cup against the rain , and that is the way the moment has stopped for me , for all time .
