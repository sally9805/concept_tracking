SAM HARK-HARKALARK walks on stage and stands behind his counter . Then , EDWARD OWLETT enters and takes his place at his counter . MR . HORNIMAN enters with two bags of money , one for SAM and one for TED , then leans upon a pedestal . SAM ( to audience ) . How do you do ? I am Sam . This is a play , pure and simple , and in the play this is a bank somewhere in Stratford , not far from this theatre.The distinguished-looking gentleman is the President of the bank , Mr. Telford Horniman , who came over from America forty-five years ago . The seedy-looking young man is Edward Owlett , or Ted , who has been with the bank six years.All of us are imagined of course , for the purpose of the structure , style , form and meaning of the play , if any.We all know that nothing here is real as we know reality outside this theatre , in the street , in the remainder of London , and in the world itself , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since total success would make it necessary for us to leave the theatre immediately , and I do n't believe we want to do that.Two hours more or less , including the intermission , is what 's at stake , plus the price of admission . For which we hope to provide you with a little amusement.This is the cue for a bell to ring indicating that the bank is open . Now , it does n't matter that bells do not ring before banks are opened . Nothing of that sort matters in this play , if in fact it matters anywhere else . ( HORNIMAN rings a school-bell . ) There it is . We have used up a little time during which to become settled , and perhaps to expect the worst . We begin , then . Sam the Highest Jumper of Them All , or The London Comedy . ( Suddenly . ) Action . Lights . Madness . ( He smiles . ) Perhaps you wo n't mind awfully . Thank you . ( SAM returns to his place . A man comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to borrow a little money . OWLETT Yes , sir , how much ? MAN Well , I need a hundred pounds . OWLETT What security do you have ? A house ? A car ? Furniture ? MAN ( Shakes his head . ) OWLETT Anything at all ? MAN I 've got three small children . OWLETT The bank wo n't lend you any money on three small children . MAN Two boys and a girl . ( He shows snapshot . ) Here 's a picture of them . Dan . John . And Rose . OWLETT Dan , John , and Rose . They 're nice-looking kids . Better try to borrow from a friend . MAN They need money , too . Could I borrow , then , fifty pounds ? OWLETT Without security the bank would n't let you have one pound . MAN Why not ? What 's a bank for ? HORNIMAN Yes , yes , what seems to be the trouble , Mr. Owlett ? OWLETT This man needs one hundred pounds , sir , but he has n't got any security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Rose . p. 4 HORNIMAN ( to MAN ) . Dan , John , and Rose do n't count , my dear man . The bank will be only too happy to lend you at six per cent interest any amount you care to name if you will be good enough to come to the bank only when you are able to abide by the rules . If you are to borrow 10,000 , for instance , you must have something tangible and real that is worth at least 30,000 . MAN I 've got a good job . It 's just that it does n't pay as much as I need . Could n't you make an exception ? HORNIMAN Impossible , sir . If everybody who needed money expected a loan without security the banks would fail in a year . MAN Why ? HORNIMAN Because people do n't pay their debts unless they have to . MAN I 'll pay my debt . HORNIMAN You may very well intend to do so , but in the meantime you may also die , and then where would the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but if I did , where would my kids be ? Are n't kids worth something ? HORNIMAN Not to the bank . I 'm afraid there is no point to any further discussion , Mr. Owlett . ( He goes back to his pedestal . TED hands back the snapshot . The MAN stands perplexed and angry , looking around the bank , then goes . MISS GALWAY steps up to SAM 'S window . SAM opens the book and reads her name. ) p. 5 SAM You wish to make a deposit , Miss Galway ? GALWAY No thank you . I 'd like to make a withdrawal , if I may . SAM In that case you will have to write out a cheque . GALWAY I 'd very much like to take out all of it , if I may . SAM One pound , six and two ? You wish to close your account , Miss Galway ? GALWAY Yes . I 'm going to have a baby . SAM Oh ? I 'm afraid there 's a closing charge of tuppence , Miss Galway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leave the pound ? GALWAY I 'm afraid not . Having a baby is rather expensive , ( Pause . ) Not having a baby is rather expensive , too , SAM Very well , Miss Galway . We 're certainly sorry to lose your account . GALWAY Oh , I 'm sorry to have it lost . SAM Has our service been satisfactory ? GALWAY Oh , yes . You 've always treated me with a great deal of kindness here at this bank . SAM Then we may expect the opening of a new account when fortune favours ? p. 6 GALWAY Yes , I think so . If fortune ever does . SAM I 'm sure it will some day . An inheritance perhaps . GALWAY An inheritance would be most welcome . I 'd certainly like things to be a little nicer for my daughter or son than they have been for me . Having things nicer is rather expensive too , is n't it ? SAM Yes , I 'm afraid it is . GALWAY Even just a little nicer . SAM ( Stamps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One pound six shillings . The account is closed , then . GALWAY Thank you ever so much . SAM Goodbye , Miss Galway . GALWAY Goodbye , Mister ? SAM Hark-Harkalark . Sam Hark-Harkalark . GALWAY Goodbye , Mr. Hark-Harkalark . If it 's a boy , perhaps you wo n't mind if I give him your name . SAM Sam ? GALWAY No , your other name . SAM Oh , you could n't do that . Your husband would n't like it . GALWAY ( Quickly ) Really ? Do you know him ? Have you seen him ? Woolworth Rockefeller Ford ? He 's an American soldier . p. 7 SAM Oh , I know he is , but I 'm afraid I have n't seen him . ( She takes her place behind another girl at FATHER FINNEGAN 'S table . ) FINNEGAN Nothing today , Coral , my dear . CORAL Nothing at all ? Not even sixpence like yesterday ? FINNEGAN The pension money will come again day after tomorrow , however . ( CORAL goes . ) Nothing , Pearl , my dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shall I have it stopped ? FINNEGAN Oh no , that would be murder . GALWAY I do n't want to . It 's just that without a father to help me bring up my baby , I thought it might be better for my baby not to be born . Sometimes I almost wish I had n't been born . I wo n't go where I 'm expected to go . I 'm too ashamed . FINNEGAN I will help you , somehow . Whenever there is nowhere else to go please come here . GALWAY This afternoon ? FINNEGAN Yes , this afternoon . GALWAY ( Softly ) Thank you . ( She goes . FATHER FINNEGAN picks up a Qantas satchel and goes . ANN MOON enters and goes straight to SAM 'S window. ) p. 8 ANN I 'd like to take out all of my money , please . SAM Are you going to have a baby , too ? ANN Is that a condition of closing the account ? SAM Oh no . I just thought perhaps you might have met an American , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SAM ( Reads from her bank book . ) Ann Moon . One pound eight and four , minus a closing charge of tuppence . ANN But I need the full amount  --  for new shoes . SAM I 'll pay the tuppence out of my pocket . ANN Oh no , I do n't want you to do that . SAM It 's all right . You see , this is my first day as a full-fledged clerk , after almost a year as office boy , and I wo n't miss the tuppence at all . ANN Are you sure ? SAM Quite . And I 'm glad you 're not going to have a baby . I mean , if you did n't want to have one , on account of the population explosion . It 's not actually an explosion of course , but I 've heard they 're asking women to think twice about it . ANN I do n't have to think about it at all . ( Pause ) I 'm glad you 've been promoted . p. 9 SAM I 've worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first day ? SAM Yes , and you 're my second transaction . I know I 'm being watched . Behind me , that 's Mr. Horniman himself , the President of the bank . ( Pause ) He started here forty-five years ago . ANN Forty-five years is a long time . SAM Not at all . It only seems long afterwards . In any case , I 'm going to do exactly what he did . ANN Does n't he mind if you chat this way ? SAM Oh no , that 's precisely what he wants me to do . This is a family bank , he says . Everybody who comes here is a member of our family . This bank is made of flesh and blood . It is not a machine . And we 're not in a hurry the way some of the other banks are . There is always time to be courteous and considerate , he says . ( HORNIMAN goes . ) ANN He 's going now . SAM Oh , I know he 's going . ANN How do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-hour . He can be very kind , but he does n't like any liberties to be taken . When you speak to him you 've got to be awfully respectful . Only the people who have been here thirty years are permitted to address him as Mr. Horniman , and most of them do n't do it . They say sir , too . p. 10 ANN Do you really want to stay thirty years just to be able to say Mr. Horniman ? SAM Forty if need be . ANN Does it mean all that to you ? SAM To be President of the bank ? What else is there worth being ? ANN There must be something else . I 'd hate to imagine what you might believe would be worth being had you gone to work a year ago for an undertaker . SAM Oh , no , I 've always been a banker . ANN I would n't work in a bank for anything in the world . SAM Why not ? ANN Why , the danger of it , for one thing . The robbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This button right here  --  just barely touch it and the alarm sounds , and it 's very loud . ANN Do you mean noise can stop a bullet ? You could be standing there , alive one minute , and dead the next . And then where would your great career be ? Where would you be ? And not only that . You might endanger the lives of everybody else in the bank . SAM Well , I certainly would n't want to endanger the lives of others . I 'd feel most unhappy if somebody else got killed , too . p. 11 ANN You would n't mind so much if it was only yourself ? SAM No , of course not . My duty is to defend the money . ANN Do you really believe money is more important than life ? SAM Ah , well , I can see you do n't understand banking . ANN I believe you want to be a hero of some kind . SAM If I had no choice , I would n't mind . It would mean immediate promotion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Smiles , stamps the book , and initials it . ) One pound eight and four , then . It 's been awfully nice chatting with you , Miss Moon . ( HORNIMAN enters . ) ANN I 've enjoyed it , too , but I hope you wo n't be dead before evening . Population explosion or no population explosion , it 's rather interesting to be somebody . Considering the alternative , it 's fascinating . And I know I would n't care to be dead suddenly . Not for all the money in the world . Me for me and my poverty for ever . SAM Life is surely more than just selfishness . ANN How much more ? Forget it . For all we know , tomorrow money may be abolished by law . p. 12 SAM Are you a Communist of some kind , or what , Miss Moon ? ANN Oh no , I 'm studying ballet . To me everything 's a dance . Always has been . Do you dance ? SAM No , but I 'd like to learn . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Could we ? ANN I do n't know why not . SAM I 'm at Number Thirty-three East Best-Two-Out-of- Three . Where are you ? ANN Angel Lane . Two twenty-two . SAM We 're neighbours . Strange I 've never seen you before . ANN I 'm in town a lot . SAM May I call ? ANN Of course . May I ? SAM May you ? I should say you may . We 're not rich yet , of course . ANN You do n't have to be rich . SAM Do n't you ? ANN Of course not . Good-bye . Take care . Do n't be a fool if you can possibly manage . SAM Really ? Why ? ANN Well , I suppose it 's because I like you . SAM You do n't ! p. 13 ANN I do . And I 'd like to see you again . Why would n't I ? SAM Well , I never imagined a girl who is studying ballet would like me . ANN And I wo n't forget the tuppence that came out of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ANN MOON goes almost dancing . SAM smiles watching her go . A GYPSY WOMAN and a TIPSTER arrive outside the bank . ) TIPSTER All right , then . What are you selling ? GYPSY For a shilling I 'll read your palm . ( TIPSTER hands her shilling and holds out his hand . ) You have some connection with horses . Ninety-nine per cent you 're a crook , one per cent doubtful , but your personality 's good . ( She goes to SAM 's window and reaches for the money , HORNIMAN stands near . ) SAM Oh no , madam , you 're not allowed to take the money . GYPSY It 's not yours . ( She goes to TED 'S window . ) GYPSY ( Places coins on counter . ) Give me silver for these coppers , boy . And for a shilling I 'll read your palm . p. 14 OWLETT ( Gives her coin . Softly . ) For sixpence I 'll read yours . ( She holds out her hand . ) I see a dark man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . GYPSY Ah , you 're a gypsy yourself , boy . I have a daughter who 'll teach you the truth . She 's eleven . Can you wait a year ? HORNIMAN Conclude your transaction , Mr. Owlett . Conclude it . ( GYPSY walks straight at HORNIMAN making him step out of her way . ) ( The TIPSTER stops two men with newspapers . ) TIPSTER It would be a lie for any man in the world to pretend that he knows the winner of any horse race , but it is not a lie when I tell you that I know , because that is the truth . I do know . I 'm not asking ten bob for this information , I 'm not asking five bob . Half a crown is the price I ask , but try to get a secret from America for less than half a million pounds . I have the winner of the three- thirty at Alexander Park . Half a crown and he 's yours . ( The two men collect the tips , going around in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion . ) TIPSTER Ike . Mac . Nik . Moa . Mike . Jack . Dick . Joe . p. 15 MAN But which horse is going to win ? TIPSTER That 's all , boys . ( They freeze . ) HORNIMAN That was about the foolishness and desperation of people wanting to get something for nothing . On another level , it was about other people and other things . Ike , Mac , Nik , Moa , Mike , Jack , Dick , Joe . These are the first names of an assortment of men who are presently world famous . Their last names are n't mentioned because in fifty years they may be forgotten , and then of course the names will stand for horses only . Which may be just as well , most likely . ( TIPSTER enters bank . ) TIPSTER Let me have a quid for these coins , boy . SAM Yes sir . ( TIPSTER takes a wad of notes from his pocket . SAM seeing this . ) Would n't you like to open an account , sir ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . TIPSTER How much money earns how much money ? SAM Any amount earns two per cent per year . TIPSTER ( Handing him the wad . ) Two hundred and ninety- nine quid . p. 16 SAM ( Finding one more . ) Three hundred . Your name , sir ? TIPSTER My real name ? SAM I 'm afraid so . TIPSTER Tully Turnpenny . SAM Three hundred pounds , now on deposit and drawing two per cent interest per year in favour of Mr. Tully Turnpenny . Your address , sir ? TIPSTER Five two seven Wapping Basin . Now , if you want to pick up a little easy money for yourself , my boy , back Dancing Girl in the four o'clock at Alexander Park . No charge . SAM Thank you , sir . ( TIPSTER goes . ) ( MR . HORNIMAN watches SAM and nods with approval as TED notices . ) HORNIMAN Sam , in all the years of my banking experience , I have never seen a more brilliant beginning . OWLETT He 's as good as President of the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . ( Calls out to the two horse-players . ) Over here please , over here . Make your deposits over here , please . HORNIMAN Mr. Owlett . In a bank it is not proper to cry out like a street hawker. p. 17 OWLETT Sorry , sir . HORNIMAN Sorry 's not enough . It may very well be that your place is not here face to face with the public . If so , I have other work for you . OWLETT ( Quickly , fearfully ) Yes , sir , it may very well be , but I most certainly would appreciate another chance , sir . HORNIMAN You 've already been at that window six years , but still hardly anybody favours you with a deposit . A few withdrawals every day , a few requests for loans without security , a few gypsies , and that 's all . Are you sure banking is the career for you ? OWLETT Oh yes , sir , I live and breathe banking . HORNIMAN But almost nobody proper ever comes to your window , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what appears to be bitter silence . OWLETT Money is a strange thing , sir . It does strange things to people , sir . HORNIMAN ( Annoyed ) I beg your pardon , Mr. Owlett ? OWLETT I mean , sir , money seems to mean so much , sir , so very much to the people who come to my window , sir , that I hesitate to engage them in any kind of light talk , sir , but it is n't that I could n't , sir , it 's simply that I feel , sir , they would rather I did n't , sir . p. 18 HORNIMAN It does n't matter what you imagine they 'd rather . It 's part of your work to keep our transactions cheerful , hopeful , hearty , human , as Sam Hark- Harkalark does . OWLETT Yes , sir . May I please have another chance , sir ? HORNIMAN One more chance , then , Mr. Owlett , but that 's all I can spare , I 'm afraid . There is other work . The wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You may be happier . OWLETT Yes , sir , but I 've never been happier than I am here . HORNIMAN Your happiness is so near despair , I wonder what your unhappiness is like . OWLETT Cheerful , sir , hopeful , hearty , human , sir . HORNIMAN Try again , then . I shall be near observing . OWLETT ( He gets to his knees . ) Yes , sir , thank you , sir . HORNIMAN All right now , I know I 'm much too kind for my own good , but there is a limit , Mr. Owlett . Back to your place . Attract your transactions , as Mr. Hark-Harkalark does . I will not allow barking . OWLETT No barking , sir . Thank you , sir . ( HORNIMAN goes . ) Dirty rat . p. 19 SAM What 's the matter , Ted ? OWLETT You 're doing me , Sam . When did I er do you ? You 're taking all the transactions . He wants to put me back to office boy . My wife 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter 'll laugh at me . SAM You 're not married , Ted . OWLETT I mean later . Send some of the transactions over here , will you ? SAM How ? I ca n't disappear , can I ? OWLETT Then , tell me what to do . What do you do ? SAM I do n't do anything . Stop worrying , will you ? There 's no need to worry . OWLETT Oh no , no need at all . After six years at this window he wants to put me back to office boy , but there 's no need to worry . I may have to pack up and go to Hong Kong or Singapore . New York or Hollywood . Far , far away . No need to worry at all , Sam . SAM Do you want me to tell Horniman I want to go back to office boy ? OWLETT He would n't think of letting you go back to office boy . Six years of fear and trembling for nothing . SAM What are you afraid of ? OWLETT Horniman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mistakes . Accidents . The H Bomb . I 'm afraid of everything . But now , since this morning , most of all , I 'm afraid of you , Sam . You 're going to kill me , I believe . p. 20 SAM I 'll go and tell him right now . I do n't want the promotion . OWLETT Go and tell him that , and he wo n't put me back to office boy , he 'll sack me , that 's what he 'll do . Just send some of the transactions over here . SAM Well , I 'll do my best . ( WALLY WAILER , a rock and roll singer , enters . He plays guitar and sings . During song PEARL GALWAY and an American soldier come on and dance , then go their separate ways . ) OWLETT Wally Wailer , the richest poor boy in London .

Now , how was I to know you were his wife ? And how was I to know he was a killer ? I am sorry in the uproar , I ran out of the nearest door , But I had to , darling Nellie , for my life . The tears are in my eyes , for all the world to see.I am sorry you were killed , darling Nellie.It was fate , I guess , or something just as bad.I am sorry , but I 'm glad it was n't me.Yes , I 'm sorry , but I 'm glad it was n't me . ( SAM hides under desk. ) p. 21 OWLETT I 'll be happy to look after you , Mr. Wailer . WALLY No hurry . I 'll wait . I 'm superstitious . Move from this window , and I might lose me voice .

It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , now , let 's see what we have here . Two thousand pounds . Congratulations , Mr. Wailer , that 's quite a sum . WALLY I feel most fortunate to have been given my glorious voice , and most grateful for the support of the public , and the devotion of the teenagers . OWLETT Ice agers . Stone agers . SAM There it is , then , Mr. Wailer . You 've got close to thirty thousand pounds in that account now , sir . WALLY But I really do n't care for money , you understand . I 'm paid in another coin . The affection of the people . The respect of the government . The love of the little children . OWLETT How about cats ? How are you doing with them ? p. 22 SAM England is proud of you .

What 's wrong with this one ? SAM Well , nothing really , but I thought you might not mind . DAISY Oh , I get it . You want to have a look at my back . ( She shows her back . ) SAM Well , thank you , but I thought you might not mind letting my friend attend to your transaction . p. 23 DAISY You mean , you do n't want to see me ?

If I do n't get the feeling , I do n't get the coin . SAM What 's that got to do with coming to this window ? BLIND MAN Well , not long ago you gave somebody a coin or two , did n't you ? SAM Well , come to think of it , I did , at that . Ann Moon , tuppence . BLIND MAN Well , I knew that from ten feet off . So I came here . It is n't that anybody cheats a blind man .

DATCHIKVILI I will try , but this bank is now ready to be robbed . p. 26 OVERBOARD You 're not trying , Captain Datchikvili . DATCHIKVILI As long as there is one empty stomach in this world I can not permit myself to enjoy funny stories . OVERBOARD I beg your pardon ? DATCHIKVILI I am crazy about funny stories .

DATCHIKVILI Where are n't they ? They are everywhere . Right here . All over London . All over England . All over America , even . OVERBOARD All over Russia ? DATCHIKVILI Only between meals . Russian stomachs between meals become not empty but ready for more food . In the last five years the production of wheat , barley , oats , rye , beef , lamb , dairy products , eggs , cheese , butter , leaf and root vegetables , tea , tobacco , wine , vodka , brandy the production of all these good things has increased thirty per cent . p. 27 OVERBOARD Well , I 'm glad .

Would you like to go in and meet the President ? DATCHIKVILI No , it 's a capitalist bank and it will soon be robbed . That is enough for me .

OVERBOARD Well , I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please forgive me for taking up your time , but I have never seen a million pounds and before I die , I want to do that .

And it is not something to laugh at . OVERBOARD The President of the bank happened to have in his vault at that time not one million pounds but ten million , and he invited the poor man to go into the vault with him to see the money . While they were in the vault the bank was held-up . A very alert young clerk quickly shut the vault door and turned the dial , so that the door could not be opened again for a week . The robbers went off with a comparatively small sum of money , and were later apprehended . In the meantime , the President of the bank informed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a week . DATCHIKVILI This is a funny story ? OVERBOARD Perhaps not . At any rate , the poor man decided to count the money to pass the time , and so he had something to do . The President on the other hand could only think of his home and his wife and his children and his fire and his supper and his brandy after supper and his bed , and so he suffered terribly . At last , a week went by , and the door of the vault was opened . DATCHIKVILI Yes , yes , please do n't stop . p. 29 OVERBOARD Now , in the meantime , all of London had taken a great deal of interest in their terrible ordeal . Which of them would d.e , which go mad , and so on . DATCHIKVILI Yes , yes . OVERBOARD Well , they both marched out . The President of the bank went back to his work , and the poor man went back to the street . DATCHIKVILI I do n't get it . OVERBOARD I have n't finished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm dying . OVERBOARD The President turned out to be the poor man , and so of course the man who had gone out into the streets was actually the President . He was never seen again . DATCHIKVILI Either I am controlling myself very good , or this funny story is not funny . OVERBOARD The point is that the same shocking experience can affect people differently . DATCHIKVILI The funny stories of Russia are funny . OVERBOARD ( Going ) Ah , well . Perhaps it 's just as well you did n't laugh , because it would only have made you feel guilty and unhappy . Shall we go along then ? p. 30 BLIND MAN ( To the audience . ) Now , you see , we 've got all this stuff going on , all these people messing about the bank , and Stratford , and London , and of course we want to make something of it , but so far we have n't , have we ? Well , it takes time . ( Girl walks on stage carrying a revolver on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gun , a toy for idiots . The way it works is this . Gunpowder is made to explode , sending a piece of metal somewhere , making the most useless sound in the whole vocabulary of sounds . From this beginning has come the machine-gun , the cannon , the rocket , all of the bombs , and a million variations of the one basic nothing sound . Bang ! Ridiculous , meaningless ( Enter MAN and WOMAN ) , a belittlement of silence , sound , and everything worthwhile it has taken us centuries to make . This noise , this insult to the human spirit , is heard in many plays , so let 's hear it too . MAN-TO-BE-EXECUTED ( After taking long puff at cigarette . ) My name is  --  I ca n't remember my name . But I am guilty  --  of trying to improve the world . And myself  --  are n't you ?

Gun shot . MAN falls . Scream . Police whistle. ) p. 31 WOMAN Oh , my God . ( Fish , dog , and teddy bear fall from above . MAN picks them up , hands one to WOMAN , and they go off . ) BLIND MAN Nobody can say what just happened , because too much happened at the same time , on account of the inferior order of excitement created by the pistol shot . And yet history is an elaborate and inaccurate account of just such stuff , multiplied and enlarged a million times . Thus , history is not gospel , it is gossip . The gun then : noise , violence , fear , hysteria , pain , confusion , grief , shame , lies , death , and the fantasy memoirs of generals . And that 's enough of that . ( Girl enters with tray and egg-beater . He puts the gun back and lifts the egg-beater . ) What 's this for ? GIRL He did n't say . ( He looks at the egg-beater and puts it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these people actually in the play so far ? SAM On my word , I do n't know , and for that matter I do n't know who Sam is . Hark-Harkalark , that is . Myself . The character I 'm playing . I do n't understand the bloke . BLIND MAN You do n't have to understand him . Just as nobody is required to understand himself . Just as nobody ever has , either . And that includes the greatest men you might care to bring to mind . You know their names . Great names . The greatest . If they had understood themselves , they might not have lived as they did , and we might not have had them brought to our attention so unforgettably . I am speaking very clearly and calmly because whenever somebody is saying very little or nothing at all , it is absolutely necessary that he be heard without excitement , otherwise it might be imagined that he is saying something , perhaps a great deal . ( The AMBASSADOR comes down the aisle and up on to the stage. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what is it ? AMBASSADOR I am the Ambassador . OWLETT For the love of God , great China has n't been recognized by America yet  --  with more than six hundred million people . Do n't tell me we have ? AMBASSADOR I am the Ambassador from the audience . We want cordial relations with the play , and I have been sent to establish and maintain them . SAM Please do so , Mr. Ambassador . AMBASSADOR From the audience to the play , greetings . Sholem Aleichem . SAM Great writer . Great humorist . AMBASSADOR From the moment since the curtain went up we have been here . And our seats are comfortable . SAM That 's good . AMBASSADOR We are a civilized people . SAM That 's good , too . AMBASSADOR And we hope that the play is also civilized . Is it ? SAM Mr. Horniman , I think this question ought to be answered by you . HORNIMAN From the play to the audience , through its Ambassador . Our government rejoices in the friendship of your government , and prays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the warmth of your proximity . p. 33 SAM What 's that mean ? HORNIMAN Glad you 're here . And we hope that you have found it possible to resist any impulse to abandon us . SAM What 's that mean ? HORNIMAN Do n't go home . SAM Why should they ? They 've just come . HORNIMAN Diplomatic language . Although we are a new nation with an unrevealed identity , we live in the expectation of making our identity known , and having done so , we dare to hope that this revelation shall neither offend nor alarm you , but rather please and appeal to you . SAM What 's that mean ? HORNIMAN We like you , please like us . SAM That sounds like a square deal . What about the part about being civilized ? HORNIMAN Well , of course , the answer is that we are civilized , because the audience is . In a sense you , the audience , are the play more than we are , for while we are the players who in concert are making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who are the true players and the true play . SAM Are you sure ? HORNIMAN No . We welcome your Ambassador , and look forward eagerly to a deepening . p. 34 SAM Of what ? HORNIMAN Everything , of course . AMBASSADOR Where do I sit ? SAM A chair for the Ambassador , please . ( A chair is brought out by the stage manager , and the AMBASSADOR sits down . ) SAM And now , Mr. Ambassador , how can we make you feel more at home ? After all this must be a strange country for you . AMBASSADOR I would like to learn the language as quickly as possible . What is it ? SAM Is n't it English ? AMBASSADOR I do not mean the philologic language . What is the inner language of the play ? GYPSY ( Who has just entered . ) Romany of course . Even all is not all . ' How could it ever be , since all has no beginning and no end ? SAM What 's that mean ? GYPSY Live and let live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess . Nobody is greater than anybody else . Relax . SAM Did that help at all ? AMBASSADOR Not really , but the fault may be mine . Now what 's this play about ? p. 35 SAM The dead , the dying , and the unborn . In short , us . AMBASSADOR All of us ? SAM We rather hope so . AMBASSADOR I see . Thank you . SAM On with the play then , please , everybody . ( Off stage the cry of a London newsboy is heard . ) " No war . How much longer can this go on ? Too many people . Everybody wants to get into the act . World 's number one problem is too many people . Too many people . " OWLETT Hear that , Sam ? Too many people . SAM Yes , it 's like I told Ann Moon . There 's this population explosion . ( Exit HORNIMAN . ) OWLETT Ann Moon ? Who 's Ann Moon ? SAM The girl who dances . You know . My second transaction . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OWLETT You gave her tuppence , did n't you ? SAM I did n't mean to make it as public as all that . OWLETT What 'd you do it for ? ( AMBASSADOR walks around them . ) SAM Oh , I do n't know . It 's not every day I get promoted . No , that 's not what I mean . It 's not every day I meet a girl like Ann Moon . p. 36 OWLETT Give every girl you meet tuppence , and you wo n't have very much left for yourself at the end of the week . SAM I enjoy giving . If I had a million pounds , I believe I 'd give it away . OWLETT It 's easy to give away a million pounds when you have n't got it . SAM If you had a million pounds , would you give it away ? OWLETT Not tuppence . Why should I give away my million pounds ? SAM You have n't got it . It does n't cost anything to want to give it away . OWLETT I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . OWLETT I do n't want to . SAM You 'll never get rich . OWLETT Did the rich get rich by giving away a million pounds ? SAM I 'm not talking about the rich . I 'm talking about the poor with money . OWLETT What poor with what money ? If they 've got money , they 're not poor any more . They 're rich , and how long does it take the poorest man in the world to know he 's rich , and act accordingly ? p. 37 SAM How long ? OWLETT The transformation is instantaneous . No matter what he was a moment ago , he becomes an instant blackguard . And would n't I like it to happen to me ? SAM But you would n't give any of it to anybody else ? OWLETT I would n't . SAM Why not ? OWLETT I need all the help I can get from a million pounds . SAM Well , if you had a million , do you think a million would be enough ? OWLETT Yes , I believe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? OWLETT I would n't be afraid of Horniman any more . ( Quickly ) Here he comes . ( TED starts counting a bundle of notes quickly ) HORNIMAN ( With an armful of brand new notes ) Sam , as a reward for the brilliant beginning you have made on your very first day as a full-fledged clerk , I am bringing you half a million pounds in brand new five-pound notes . SAM Half a million , sir ? HORNIMAN ( Proudly ) Half a million pounds . p. 38 SAM Sir , is n't that just a little more than I am likely to need for the day 's transactions ? HORNIMAN Of course it is , and that 's just the point . I know a banker when I see one . I want you to know my trust in you is absolute and implicit . That 's what this means . Now , just sign this receipt , please . Count the money at your leisure . Always do that , Sam . Check the money . Make sure it 's all there . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more  --  well , I need n't urge you to report it . Right there . ( SAM , with shaking hand , begins to sign . ) SAM I 've run out of space here , sir . HORNIMAN Just turn the page over and spell out the rest of your name on the other side . ( SAM does so . ) Very good . ( He reads the signature . ) Sam Hark- ( Turns the slip of paper over . ) Harkalark . Carry on , then . OWLETT Sir ? HORNIMAN ( A little annoyed ) Yes , Mr. Owlett ? What is it ? OWLETT Do you have any new notes for me , sir ? To sign for ? HORNIMAN Certainly not , Mr. Owlett . I will reward you when you deserve to be rewarded . p. 39 OWLETT Yes , sir . Thank you , sir . HORNIMAN Carry on . OWLETT Sir ? HORNIMAN ( Blowing up ) Yes ? Please continue . Do n't say sir , and stop . OWLETT What can I do to deserve to be rewarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Emphatically ) Be a banker . AMBASSADOR Hold it . Hold it , please . OWLETT Yes ? AMBASSADOR What does the President of the bank mean by saying , " Be a banker , be a banker ? " OWLETT He means he wants me to stop being Edward Owlett , and I ca n't , because that 's who I am , you see . Edward Owlett . Nobody else . AMBASSADOR Who would he prefer you to be ? OWLETT Well , nobody in particular . He just wants me to stop being me . AMBASSADOR Why ? OWLETT Well , you see , I 've been at this bank so long and I 've become so good at seeming to be awfully humble that he is beginning to suspect I consider bankers in general contemptible , and he himself the most contemptible banker of all . p. 40 AMBASSADOR But he 's not quite sure ? OWLETT Not quite . How could he be ? With all my grovelling ? AMBASSADOR The grovelling , then , is actually a performance ? OWLETT Yes , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a performance six years ago , but little by little more than half of the time I forget that it is a performance and so it 's real , too . AMBASSADOR Had n't you better think of another career ? OWLETT I barely thought of this one . AMBASSADOR I think I understand now . I 'm sorry I had to interrupt . HORNIMAN Not at all . We want you to interrupt whenever you feel the need of a certain amount of clarification . AMBASSADOR Is there anything you would care to add to Mr. Owlett 's comments ? HORNIMAN Sam , perhaps it would be more to the point if you added a word or two to Mr. Owlett 's comments . SAM Ted 's my best friend and he 's got a great sense of humour . You never know when he 's playing a practical joke and when he 's serious . You might get the impression he has n't got anything to live for , but I 've seen Ted eat fish and chips and nobody who eats fish and chips the way Ted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition of great expectations . Ted still expects plenty . p. 41 HORNIMAN Thank you , Sam . I believe that threw a little additional light on the matter . ( Music like thunder is heard . ) SAM ( To AMBASSADOR ) Now , that storm . Perhaps I 'd better explain it . We just do that . AMBASSADOR You just do it ? It does n't mean anything ? SAM What could it possibly mean ? It 's a storm . If we were not in London , if we were in another time entirely , an earlier time , the time of caves , for instance , it would mean we 'd better get to the caves as quickly as possible . AMBASSADOR On account of the rain . SAM On account of our fear . Of the unknown . Of large things not understood . A kind of language unknown to us . A language of the gods , so to say . Or the language of God , the one God . AMBASSADOR I had no idea . Would it be asking too much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? AMBASSADOR Yes , I believe I do . SAM Again , please . ( After listening , the AMBASSADOR blows his nose loudly . ) SAM Are you all right , Mr. Ambassador ? p. 42 AMBASSADOR Yes , yes , thank you , quite all right . It 's just that for a moment there a strange feeling of loneliness took possession of me , and it rather hurt , I must say . Was that intended ? SAM Well , no , but of course we 're glad to accept just about anything of that order that might come along . AMBASSADOR And so there you are , the two of you , at work in the bank , one favoured , and one not . Now , what 's going to happen ? SAM Well , next is the hold-up . AMBASSADOR ( As FATHER FINNEGAN and the GYPSY WOMAN come in . ) The bank is to be robbed , is it ? FINNEGAN ( As he speaks the GYPSY WOMAN draws near and looks intently at his face . ) In a manner of speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day I visit a bank somewhere in London . On my way to the bank , I pray . I ask for a small miracle . Nothing so extraordinary as the raising of the dead . I pray for money , on behalf of those who have not yet been born . Perhaps the miracle shall be a rich man near the end of his time , who shall in a sudden burst of understanding hand me a great sum of money . Or a thief who shall take it by force , and , while making his escape , hand it to me . I do n't know how it shall happen , but here I am again , in another bank , in another neighbourhood of London , a total stranger . I have no business in any bank , but in my religion the bank is the church , and I come to it as others go to their Church . To me the shabbiest bank is even more beautiful than the greatest cathedral . For this is where the money is , and money is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AMBASSADOR All the same , you shall rob this bank , is that it ? FINNEGAN I do n't believe so . GYPSY ( Points at FATHER FINNEGAN . ) That man lives by the grand and secret law which is beyond written law , and by which the Romany people have always lived in freedom  --  and poverty . He is out of Gemini . FINNEGAN Sagittarius , I believe , the Archer . GYPSY You were only told it was Sagittarius . You did not mark the time of your arrival , or the circumstance . It was marked for you , and inaccurately , as most markings are . Your mother perished , and your father was not there , knew nothing of you , lived and died knowing nothing of you . FINNEGAN You know me , Madam ? GYPSY I do now . I did n't until I saw you , and I did n't see you until now . The concern of your whole life has been for the unwanted , the forsaken , the alone . Every dog has his day . Here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that right ? SAM Yes , that 's right . HORNIMAN Be a banker , Mr. Owlett , be a banker . OWLETT Yes , sir . p. 44 HORNIMAN Observe Mr. Hark-Harkalark , and learn how to be a banker . OWLETT Yes , sir . ( HORNIMAN goes . TED studies FATHER FINNEGAN . Begins to write a hold-up note , as a practical joke . SAM is busy counting the new bank-notes very quickly . TED observes him . ) Oh , Sam 's the banker , all right . You 're the banker , are n't you , Sam ? ( SAM gestures that he 's counting and is n't to be interrupted . TED holds the note before him , reads it . ) " Put all of the money into the Qantas satchel or expect the worst . A word to the wise is sufficient . Q. " HORNIMAN ( Quickly ) Will you come to my office a moment , please , Mr. Owlett ? ( SAM drops some notes , which scatter , and he stoops to pick them up . TED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FINNEGAN Now ? GYPSY Now . ( FINNEGAN goes to SAM 'S window . SAM gathers up the fallen notes , and stands . He finds FINNEGAN at his window . He finds the hold-up note . He looks from the note to FINNEGAN , who now places the Qantas bag on the counter . ) SAM ( Picks up the note , reads it very slowly . ) " Put all of the money into the Qantas satchel or expect the worst . A word to the wise is sufficient . Q. " ( Aside ) He ca n't do this . I 'll press the button and sound the alarm . ( A large WOMAN , and a MAN , not together , come in . The MAN carries a ticking clock . ) Who are these people ? Are they part of his gang ? What 's that clock ? ( The WOMAN fishes through a small purse . The MAN places the clock on the floor and searches through his pockets . ) Is it a bomb ? p. 45 ANN ( Comes in dancing . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? ( She goes . ) SAM But I may not be able to make it tonight . I may be dead . ( Suddenly ) Dead ? ( He begins to put the brand-new notes into the satchel . ) GYPSY Oh , the purity of it , the absolute innocence , the rightness , the beauty . ( FINNEGAN looks up in gratitude , takes the satchel , bows to SAM , and goes , slowly , to his table , and starts handing money to CORAL and PEARL . ) AMBASSADOR Is that the robbery ? SAM The first part of it . AMBASSADOR And who has seen it ? SAM Well , I have and you have . AMBASSADOR And these other people ? SAM They have n't . They 've been busy with their own lives . AMBASSADOR Quite . ( Girls and FINNEGAN go . ) OWLETT ( Returns ) Mr. Horniman has just been informed by the Bank of England that each of the new notes is defective and must be returned and destroyed . p. 46 SAM What 's the matter with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who signs every Bank of England note well , it 's too complicated to explain . The notes are signed Good God . Mr. Horniman wants me to take them back . SAM Well , it 's too late , I 'm afraid . OWLETT Why ? SAM The bank 's been robbed . OWLETT Well , press the alarm button , for God 's sake . ( SAM presses the button . Swan Lake is heard . The AMBASSADOR gets to his feet , confused . The MAN and WOMAN imitate ballet dancers . The music stops . ) SAM The alarm has been sounded , and the robber ca n't be far , so I cry out : ( He speaks evenly . ) Stop that man . This cry is always for somebody harmless . Stop that man , he 's taken my hat , for instance . It is never for anybody really sinister . Now , immediately after crying stop that man , I make a great leap over the counter . ( He takes one step . ) And then I run with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps . ) But this woman stands in my way . Not me , madam . And this man also stands in my way . Not me , sir . I 'm Sam Hark-Harkalark . Well , all they know is that somebody cried stop that man , and I 'm the only man who 's moving , so of course they believe I must be the man to stop . But I break through just in time to come face to face with a London Bobby who wants to catch the bank robber . There I stand like Oliver Twist scrubbed and bathed , and here comes the club . ( The Bobby strikes him over the head . ) Now , here , we could have had a song and dance , if we really wanted to : If the bloke who spoke out of turn , And was hit over the head , is n't down or dead , Hit him another over the head.Hit him another over the head . ( The Bobby hits him another over the head . ) Now , I 'm out like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He makes a stiff fall and is caught by the MAN with the clock , who lets him down gently , flat on his back . ) Second part of the robbery . p. 47 HORNIMAN ( Enters . ) Is that Sam ? ( TED nods . He goes to SAM . ) What 's the matter with Sam ? CLOCK He robbed the bank , but we caught him , did n't we ? WOMAN I 'd very much like to faint , if I may . CLOCK By all means . ( She leans back . He supports her . ) HORNIMAN Sam robbed the bank ? Mr. Owlett , do you know anything about this ? OWLETT No , sir . I was in your office at the time . HORNIMAN Are you sure you know nothing about this ? OWLETT Only what Sam told me when I came back to fetch the defective notes . They were gone . HORNIMAN All of them ? OWLETT Yes , sir . HORNIMAN ( Looking up . His mind working quickly . ) All two million pounds , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it half a million ? HORNIMAN Two million , Mr. Owlett . They were all gone ? OWLETT ( Catching on ) Yes , sir . p. 48 HORNIMAN Well , wake him up . We 've got to ask him to identify the robber . CLOCK You mean , he is n't the robber ? HORNIMAN I 'm not sure . In any case , I 'm very sorry , but this is the end of the banking career of Sam Hark-Harkalark . Bring him along to my office then , please , officer . ( They all go off leaving TED to look after the two transactions . The WOMAN changes twelve pennies for a shilling and departs . MAN with clock goes to TED 'S window , presents his book , and some money for deposit . ) OWLETT ( Aside ) Be a banker , be a banker . ( Marks book . ) Thank you , Mr. Wiseguy . CLOCK Who ? OWLETT ( Looks at name in book again . ) Wiseguy ? Is n't that what it says here ? Artie Wiseguy ? CLOCK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you five years ago . Ca n't you read your own handwriting ? OWLETT I 'm sorry , sir . I must have written Wiseguy . Is n't that your name ? CLOCK My name is Arthur Wishingwell . OWLETT Artie Wiseguy is the name that 's in the book , sir . p. 49 CLOCK I do n't care what name is in the book , it 's not my name . OWLETT Well , you 've always got your address . Three thirty-nine Cobbler 's Road . CLOCK Is that written in there , too ? OWLETT Yes , of course . Is n't three thirty-nine Cobbler 's Road your address ? CLOCK No , it 's not my address . OWLETT That 's what 's in the book . CLOCK Well , is the book my book ? OWLETT It 's the book you brought . CLOCK How much is in the account ? OWLETT A hundred and thirty-seven pounds seven shillings and thruppence . Is that correct ? CLOCK No , it 's not correct . OWLETT How much do you make it ? CLOCK One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thruppence . OWLETT Somebody left off a one up at the top of the figures , I expect . CLOCK Let me look at that book . OWLETT Yes , sir . ( He hands him the book. ) p. 50 CLOCK The name written here is quite clearly Arthur Wishingwell . My name . The address is five twenty- five Upper Crown Road , and that 's my address . The amount in the account is one thousand one hundred and thirty-seven pounds seven shillings and thruppence . All very clearly written . OWLETT Then , everything 's all right ? CLOCK Well , I do n't know . Now . How do I draw out my money ? OWLETT Well , you just take your book to the bank and say so . CLOCK Well , here 's my book and I 'm saying so . I want to draw out all of my money . OWLETT Yes , that 's exactly the way to do it , and then the clerk will count out the money and give it to you , minus a closing charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take your tuppence and give me the rest . If this is banking , I 'd rather put my money in a cracked teapot . OWLETT Yes , sir , but of course accidents will happen and people will make mistakes . CLOCK Not at a bank , on my money , they wo n't . OWLETT Sometimes the mistakes are in your favour , sir . p. 51 CLOCK Well , here 's another pound . Deposit it . OWLETT ( Takes the pound note and enters it in the book . ) Thank you , sir . CLOCK ( Looks into book . ) Well , this time you have n't made a mistake . OWLETT I 'm sorry . Better luck next time , perhaps . CLOCK Now , if you had made a mistake , if you had written two thousand one hundred and thirty-eight pounds seven shillings and thruppence , instead of one thousand , and I asked you to close the account , would you hand me two thousand one hundred and thirty-eight pounds seven shillings and thruppence ? OWLETT Oh yes , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that what I wrote ? Two thousand ? CLOCK No , it 's still one thousand . ( OVERBOARD . DATCHIKVILI and a DOCTOR walk across the stage . ) OVERBOARD By jove , you were right about the robbery . Two million pounds . OWLETT Half a million . OVERBOARD A gang , most likely . ( They go into HORNIMAN 'S office. ) p. 52 CLOCK ( Gets out another pound . Places it on the counter with his book . ) OWLETT What 's this ? CLOCK I 'd like to deposit another pound . OWLETT ( Makes the entry in the book . ) Yes , sir . Thank you , sir . ( They both sing TEA FOR TWO . CLOCK takes the book . ) Any mistake ? CLOCK No , there is n't . OWLETT Want to try again ? CLOCK I do n't know if I 've got any more money on me . ( He searches his pockets . ) OWLETT Smashing weather . CLOCK Yes , is n't it . No , I 'm afraid I 've deposited all the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? CLOCK Oh no , I 've got to get back to work . I 've got a dozen stopped clocks to fix , but I 'll be back again soon , hoping for a favourable mistake . OWLETT I 'll be very careful . ( CLOCK salutes TED , who returns the salute , and CLOCK goes . ) AMBASSADOR You tried out a new way of being a banker , did you ? p. 53 OWLETT Yes , and I must say , it worked very nicely , too . Now , Scotland Yard and Interpol are in Mr. Horniman 's office asking Sam a lot of questions . And a Doctor . ( FATHER FINNEGAN is seen seated at his desk miming distributing the money to imaginary girls . ) OWLETT And that 's Father Finnegan , handing out the money to the girls , of course . AMBASSADOR But where are the girls ? OWLETT They 're right there , queued up . AMBASSADOR It is n't necessary for us to see them ? OWLETT Five thousand girls ? Not until they make the movie . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office accompanied by the DOCTOR , DATCHIKVILI , OVERBOARD , HORNIMAN and a POLICEMAN . ) DOCTOR All right now , off we go to the clinic for x-rays . I 'm afraid there has been a concussion , and you may have to go to hospital for observation . SAM You can go to hospital for observation . I 'm going home . ( To TED , astonished ) He sacked me . He says I 'm in on the robbery . He says I 've been working a whole year with a gang of international crooks . He says there was no hold-up note . p. 54 OWLETT Well , he 's wrong there . There was a hold-up note . I know there was . HORNIMAN How do you know , Mr. Owlett ? You were in my office at the time of the robbery . OWLETT Well , I know Sam would n't say there was a hold-up note if there was n't one . HORNIMAN Well , where is it , then ? We 'll turn it over to Scotland Yard and in no time at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that so , Inspector Overboard ? OVERBOARD Not quite . We 'll know a little more than we know now . SAM He wants to put me in jail . OVERBOARD There is no evidence at all that this lad is implicated in the robbery . The fact is , Mr. Horniman , I 'm astonished that your own security officer was not on the premises . HORNIMAN As I told you , I was obliged to send him on a banking errand . OVERBOARD And your alarm system works in a most peculiar manner , Mr. Horniman . HORNIMAN Well , a short circuit , most likely . DOCTOR Sam , how did you come by this name , Hark-Harkalark ? SAM My great-great-grandfather was stepped over in a pub by Shelley , Stepped right over him in the Green Man . Quite an honour . So he took the name . p. 55 DOCTOR But I do n't believe Shelley wrote that poem . SAM Joe Shelley ? Of course he did n't . He did n't write any poem . He trained larks . DOCTOR Trained them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any rate to try not to be , high-larking about all the time , not a care in the world . Slowed them down . Taught them peace . Gave them dignity . A missionary he was . ( The DOCTOR looks at OVERBOARD , DATCHIKVILI , and HORNIMAN . ) OWLETT How 's your head , Sam ? SAM I do n't know . ( Steps forward , smiles . ) Act One Finale now , complete with message : People are O.K. BLIND MAN The bank has been robbed . Who robbed the bank ? Was it Father Finnegan , who went off with the money ? ( FINNEGAN enters . ) Was it Ted Owlett who wrote the hold-up note , as a joke ? Was it Sam , who put the money into the satchel ? Was it Ann Moon , who planted the seed of fear in Sam 's soul ? ( Enter ANN MOON . ) Was it the alarm system which failed ? Or did the human conscience rob the bank ? ( Everybody comes on stage . ) It really does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's plenty more where that came from . And where did it come from ? p. 56 AMBASSADOR It came from the people , of course . POLICEMAN Nothing is worth a damn without them . DATCHIKVILI Everything is from them and therefore must be for them . GYPSY They made religion , and they can throw it out , make it over , call it blasphemy , or let it please or bore them . SAM They made art , and they can take it or leave it , believe or disbelieve it , use or refuse to use it . OWLETT They made science . Science did n't make them . If science unmakes them , it wo n't be science , it will be a few of them unmaking the lot of them . FINNEGAN They very nearly made the universe by noticing it at all , making a guess and then a second guess . OVERBOARD They invented the law , or no . And then they answered it with freedom , or yes . ANN In order to rejoice , they invented choice : yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . HORNIMAN Superior me , inferior you . WALLY They invented song and dance , wine , whisky , and games of chance . OWLETT And then they did something very funny  --  they invented money . p. 57 BLIND MAN If it were n't for the people the human race would fail . OWLETT But who wants the human race ? Its lazy , it 's stupid , it has n't got any class , it 's crude . HORNIMAN It 's always coughing , its nose is always running , and it always smells . SAM No government can afford to be rude , and so it will never be said to its face , but the fact of the matter is , to hell with the human race . OWLETT Remember , it has not yet been established that the radioactive fall-out from H Bomb tests is destroying the human race at its source , in the genes . All we know at this point is that all over the world strange things are happening . GALWAY The radioactive fall-out is n't going to do anything strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world is prepared to assure you again and again that nothing strange is going to happen to your baby  --  until it does . HORNIMAN May I remind you that the economy of the world is now sounder than it has ever before been , solely because of the enormous employment and business created by the rivalry between the great nations in connection with bombs , rockets , missiles , and other things of this sort which are still secret ? p. 58 CLOCK The making of destructive power ? HORNIMAN Only potentially destructive . Only if need be . SAM And he sacked me . He said I 'm part of an international gang of criminals . Oh , boy , get a load of him . ( To the audience ) And that 's the end of Act One . WALLY SINGS Too many people , the wise men warn.Too many kids who should never have been born.Too many people who take too long to die.Too many people , not counting you and I. EVERYBODY You and I are here to stay , We are the wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And to hell with all the rest . DANCING AND SINGING@@ At the bank , SAM 'S counter has been replaced by a small black tombstone : SAM 1960 SAM wears black athletic trunks , a white jersey with a large red number 1 on it , and white tennis shoes . By means of a plain chair , a pot-rack , and a long feather-duster , which he places on the floor , SAM sets up the high-jump . SAM Act Two . Now , this is where things get worse . Or better . Or stay the same . If we do n't make it now , our goose is cooked . AMBASSADOR Now or never , is that it ? SAM Precisely . What 's the theatre for now ? What can a play say that 's worth saying now ? Drop your bomb and be damned ? Drop it or stop it ? Were you proud to be a human being when we bombed Hiroshima ? Around the moon the rockets fly , and here we are , not even flying a kite . WALLY ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help me fly this kite.I only want to see the moon , Flying in the night-time sky.The day-time is the only time , And darkness comes , too soon , too soon.For me this world is quite all right , Somebody help me fly this kite . p. 60 AMBASSADOR What now ? SAM We shall try to fly a kite , at any rate . AMBASSADOR Why ? SAM This is not a Summit Meeting . AMBASSADOR Why not ? I 'm ready for a Summit Meeting if you are . I think we ought to discuss disarmament , nuclear tests , radioactive fall-out , and accidental war . Could n't we have a touch of that in the play , too ? SAM If you like . AMBASSADOR Stop wasting our money on weapons . Better schools and more teachers might be a good idea , for one thing . Stop polluting and poisoning the air of the world and the people who have to breathe the air . There must be better things to test , for better reasons . Stop making powerful weapons that any eccentric in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to save civilization , or six or seven other things he might think of on the spur of the moment . In short , do n't drop the bomb , boys . Your mothers will be ashamed of you . SAM That seems to cover the situation pretty well . AMBASSADOR I do n't think the language was diplomatic enough , actually . SAM Meeting closed , and on with the play , Sam the Highest Jumper of Them All . ( He turns quickly , to study the high-jump . The AMBASSADOR watches him a moment , and then stands to one side. ) p. 61 WALLY ( Sings ) Who is old and who is new ? Who can do what you ca n't do ? Sam  --  Sam , Hark-Harkalark.Who knows all and more than all ? Who 's got heart from wall to wall ? Who 's the highest jumper of them all ? Sam 's the man we 're waiting for , Nineteen years outside our door , Except for Sam we 'd be at war , Sam the highest jumper of them all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his thinking , and then TED , and MR . HORNIMAN . SAM 'S GRANDMOTHER stands near the tombstone , watching him . She carries his grey banking suit over her arm , and holds a sealed letter in her hand . ) GRANDMA Sam ? ( There is no reaction from SAM . ) I could shout and I do n't believe he 'd hear me . ( SAM moves slowly around the high-jump , followed by his GRANDMOTHER , whom he does not see . ) ( The people who are in his thoughts speak softly . ) ANN Try not to be a fool , if you can manage . I 'm coming to visit tonight at seven . All right ? OWLETT Oh , Sam 's the banker all right . You 're the banker , are n't you , Sam ? p. 62 HORNIMAN I am sorry , but this is the end of the banking career of Sam Hark-Harkalark . GRANDMA Sam ! What 's this , now ? SAM ( Notices her for the first time . ) Oh , it 's you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was ? SAM Nobody , really . ( The three people go in silence . ) GRANDMA Now , Sam , they 're coming at four , and you 've simply got to be ready for them . SAM I wish you would n't interrupt me when I 'm working . GRANDMA Working , Sam ? SAM Yes , of course . I 'm finding out what I 've got to do next , and how I 've got to do it . GRANDMA Well , just what do you believe you 've got to do ? SAM Jump . GRANDMA ( Indicates high-jump . ) Is that what that 's for ? SAM Yes , of course . GRANDMA And that get-up you 've been in since morning ? SAM These are my track clothes . You remember when I wore ' em at school . p. 63 GRANDMA That was a long time ago , Sam , and you were at school , and that 's all in the past . SAM Well , it 's back in the present now . GRANDMA ( Pointedly ) Sam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , and the day before that , they 're coming back again in a few minutes . SAM ( Indifferently ) Let ' em come . ( He begins to study the high-jump again . ) GRANDMA ( Quickly ) Do n't you dare go back to work . I tanned you when you were a small boy , when your poor mother was killed in the blitz , and your poor father was killed in Burma , fighting the heathen , and you were fished out of the rubble and ruin of a whole block of smashed houses , scratched and bruised but still alive  --  I tanned you then , Sam , and I 'll do it again , if I must . SAM What heathen was he fighting ? GRANDMA Oh , one of the various heathens . Now , you listen to me . It is n't going to do for the visitors to see you this way . SAM What way ? GRANDMA First , you do n't look right . Second , you do n't sound right . Third , you do n't act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're beginning to say you 're ill . SAM Crazy ? GRANDMA They 're hinting your grandfather and I must have you looked after . SAM In the looney bin ? GRANDMA For three hours last night your grandfather tried to write a letter to The Times , another to the Home Secretary , and another to a lawyer whose name he got out of the telephone directory . But he could n't write to them , so he wrote to you , Sam . ( She hands him the letter . ) SAM But I see him when he gets home from work . GRANDMA All the same , he wanted to write to you . ( He opens the envelope , unfolds the sheet of paper , turns it right side up , and reads the letter . ) SAM Sam , something 's wrong somewhere , and it 's not your fault . But ever since the robbery , you 're not the same . If you can stop being changed , Sam , I wish you would , because then I would n't need to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems small at first , but little by little it moves out until it 's the trouble with the whole world . And I 'm too old and ignorant to try to do anything about that , Come back , if you can , Sam . ( SAM thinks for a moment . ) What does he mean ? p. 65 GRANDMA Stop being like this . Think before you speak . Help the police find the robber . Do n't say the things you 've been saying to the newspaper reporters . SAM What have I been saying ? GRANDMA Do n't you know ? SAM They ask and I answer . Is n't that what I 'm supposed to do ? GRANDMA Your answers are too wise for a young man . It is n't wise to be wise , Sam . When you are wise , people have got to believe you 're crazy . SAM Well , let 's keep the reporters out of here , then . GRANDMA There 's a bobby out front and another in the back to keep the reporters out , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the papers . SAM Well , let 's keep everybody out , then . GRANDMA You might as well know , Sam  --  you 're being kept in . SAM I have n't wanted to go out . GRANDMA Yes , I know , but you 're being kept in by the ones we ca n't keep out . Now , get into your grey banking suit , before they 're here . SAM No , I 'm going back to work the minute they 're gone . ( A door chime ) p. 66 GRANDMA Well , it 's too late now , I 'm afraid . Please think before you speak . ( She goes quickly . SAM watches her go , then shakes his head quickly several times as if to clear it . He steps back , and waits . The visitors are INSPECTOR OVERBOARD , CAPTAIN DATCHIKVILI , the DOCTOR , and a social-working PRINCESS . ) OVERBOARD Well , how do you feel today , my boy ? SAM Inspector , when you ask a question like that , do you expect the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? OVERBOARD ( Looks at the DOCTOR . ) Well , you 're quite right , Sam . I 'm not a doctor , and so my question is academic . Let me put it this way . I hope you are well and happy . SAM I hope you are , too . OVERBOARD Thank you . May I present her Serene Highness PRINCESS No , no , please , Inspector . I am here solely as a social-worker . How do you do ? ( She makes the royal wave of the arm twice , smiling with condescension . ) SAM How do you do ? PRINCESS How many of you are there ? SAM Just the one . p. 67 PRINCESS Oh , no , I mean , how many in your family ? SAM Three . PRINCESS You and your father and mother ? SAM Grandfather and grandmother . PRINCESS And where are they ? SAM ( Moves his head slightly . ) My grandmother let you in . PRINCESS And your grandfather  --  where is he ? SAM I was about to tell you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me . My grandfather 's at work . PRINCESS What does he do ? SAM He 's a sandwich man . PRINCESS He makes sandwiches ? SAM He wears them . PRINCESS He wears them ? Is that possible ? SAM Two sign boards . PRINCESS Oh yes , I believe I did see an old man doing that once : " Boycott South American Goods ? " ( She means South African , of course . ) How long has he had the job ? SAM Since yesterday morning . He had a lot of jobs like that until a year ago when I went to work at the bank and asked him to quit . p. 68 PRINCESS You 'd rather he did n't work ? SAM Yes , of course . PRINCESS And your grandmother ? Does she work ? SAM She looks after my grandfather and me . PRINCESS Does that take up all of her time ? SAM Yes , it does . PRINCESS ( With an unbelieving superior air ) Really ? GRANDMA ( Annoyed ) Now , look here , Miss . OVERBOARD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) GRANDMA Yes , I do understand . And I would like to know how much longer my grandson and my husband and I must put up with this sort of thing ? PRINCESS You know who I am , and you speak to me in that tone of voice ? GRANDMA You are a social worker uninvited in this house , and I 'm inviting you to get out . PRINCESS Doctor , have you questioned her ? DOCTOR Yes , to a certain extent . PRINCESS And what have you learned ? p. 69 DOCTOR They 're an old English family . Londoners . PRINCESS ( Glancing aloofly from one face to another , speaking in a witheringly soft and refined tone of voice . ) The situation is all too clear to me , and so I shall return immediately to the social centre and hand in my report . DOCTOR ( Holds out his arm . ) May I be permitted to urge you not to hand in a report at this time , please ? PRINCESS You may not . ( She waves to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please do n't worry about this , and may we be alone with Sam ? ( GRANDMA goes . ) Sam , I notice a change in you . You 're wearing tennis shoes and shorts and an athletic jersey with a large number one on it . Why ? SAM ( Looks straight ahead , as if in a trance . ) Well , I just thought I would n't wear out my good-clothes , so I put on these old clothes . DOCTOR And what 's that over there ? ( Indicates high-jump . ) SAM Oh , that 's just a kind of haphazard arrangement of furniture . DOCTOR What 's it for ? p. 70 SAM Nothing . DOCTOR It must be for something , Sam . SAM Well , maybe it 's for looking at , then . DOCTOR But you 're not looking at it . SAM Well , I thought my grandfather might enjoy looking at it when he came home from work . DOCTOR I 'm sure he will . I know I enjoy looking at it . Does it have a purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could it be something to jump over ? SAM That 's not for you to jump over , Doctor . DOCTOR Why not ? SAM It 's for me to jump over . DOCTOR Well , jump over it , then , Sam . SAM I 'm not ready yet . DOCTOR You 've got your tennis shoes on . SAM I 've got to work before I jump . DOCTOR What sort of work ? SAM I 've got to think . I 've got to learn a lot . DOCTOR About what ? SAM About everything of course , because only by understanding a lot about everything will I be able to understand about jumping , too . p. 71 DOCTOR What is it that you want to understand about jumping , Sam ? SAM In the first place I want to find out what jumping is , and in the second place I want to find out how I am going to jump higher than any other human being has ever jumped . DOCTOR You want to jump higher than anybody else has ever jumped ? SAM And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to . DOCTOR But why , Sam ? SAM Why does anybody do anything harder or better than anybody else ? DOCTOR Well , you tell me . Why ? SAM To be somebody . That 's why I 'm going to jump very high . DOCTOR But that cross-bar ca n't be much more than two feet high . Anybody could jump over that . SAM I believe a good place to begin is at the beginning . A little while ago the cross-bar was on the floor . DOCTOR Did you jump over the bar , then ? SAM No . DOCTOR Why not ? p. 72 SAM I 'm studying the problem . DOCTOR When do you plan to jump ? SAM When I 'm sure I 'll be able to jump higher than anybody else . DOCTOR I believe the world 's record is higher than seven feet now , Sam . A chap in the United States . SAM Yes , I know . Seven feet , one and one-fifth inches , to be exact . John Thomas . DOCTOR ( Raising his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , would n't it ? SAM Yes , that 's about right . DOCTOR That 's pretty high , is n't it , for a chap your size ? SAM Not if you understand everything the way I 'm beginning to . I do n't expect to jump until the cross-bar 's at seven feet three inches . DOCTOR That 's awfully high , Sam . SAM I may not jump until it 's at seven feet four , or five , even . DOCTOR Why not ? SAM Because I 'll know I can do it , and the higher the better . DOCTOR For what ? SAM For me . For jumping . For everybody . If I can do it , it can be done . And if it can be done in a simple thing like jumping , imagine the things that can be done in thinking . p. 73 DOCTOR All right , Sam , let 's say you 've got the cross-bar at seven feet five , and you 're ready , and the whole world 's waiting to see you make the jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whoop , zoop , and over . DOCTOR Whoop , zoop , and over ? SAM Whoop , zoop , and over . DOCTOR What 's the whoop ? SAM That 's all your thinking , all your understanding , all your concentration . DOCTOR And the zoop ? SAM That 's demonstrating it . Not an ounce of wasted energy . Not a flicker of a flaw in the movement . All of it pure , as natural and as easy as breathing when you 're asleep . DOCTOR Why not when you 're awake ? SAM Too many distractions . Too many things that have no connection with the problem , but of course after I 've worked hard , even when I 'm awake the naturalness will be with me , and will carry me over . DOCTOR As light as a feather ? SAM Nothing like that at all . A feather can only fall . Only animals can jump . DOCTOR Birds fly . p. 74 SAM That 's another thing entirely . DOCTOR All right , then , let 's say you make the jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DOCTOR Well , specifically , what ? SAM Fame , wealth , importance . DOCTOR You want to be rich and famous and important ? SAM Who does n't ? DOCTOR Oh , I can imagine that a lot of people do n't . I might even say I do n't . SAM Why not ? DOCTOR I suppose it 's because I know I ca n't be . SAM I do n't know that . If I know anything , I know I can be . DOCTOR By jumping ? SAM As a beginning . One thing leads to another , you know . DOCTOR Sam , do you want my candid opinion ? SAM I know your candid opinion . DOCTOR You ca n't do it , Sam . It 's a physical impossibility . SAM Talk that way to Jesus walking water where would the world be ? p. 75 DOCTOR Then , being a good Christian is how you expect to do it , is that it ? SAM No , because I 'm not a Christian , good or bad . DOCTOR Why not ? SAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that ? SAM My religion average . I 'm none of any of ' em , but at the same time I 'm a little of all of ' em . DOCTOR Are you a Jew , too ? SAM Of course . DOCTOR And a Muslim ? SAM Yes . DOCTOR A Buddhist ? SAM Why not ? A lot of people are Buddhists , and if there 's something there for them , there must be a little something there for me , too . DOCTOR And races and colours , what about them , Sam ? SAM I 'm all races and colours , too . DOCTOR Are you a negro ? SAM Of course . ( Remembering ) And there I stood all of a sudden  --  white ! Drumming me toes on the Mission floor because all the others were black . Gad , what embarrassment , what inferiority . p. 76 DOCTOR Sam , what do you believe in ? SAM Freedom for India . DOCTOR But India is free . SAM I am speaking of more freedom . ( Pause ) For everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To be alive decently , of course . DOCTOR All right , Sam . We 'll talk again tomorrow . SAM You think I 'm crazy , do n't you ? DOCTOR We do n't use a word like crazy any more , Sam . It 's really meaningless , you know . But I do believe something happened when you were hit over the head . SAM Bet your life something happened . I came to my senses . DOCTOR Well , let 's hope so . ( DOCTOR , DATCHIKVILI and OVERBOARD leave , and SAM goes off . The BLIND MAN enters . ) BLIND MAN Well , now , we 've come to madness , have n't we ? Our boy has flipped his lid . Twice . First when he put the money into the satchel , and then when he decided to jump higher than anybody else in the world . And so of course he must be mad . But he 's fighting it out , as we all do . To be alive in the human body is the basic madness , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer not to be an animal at all . But it 's too late now , because long ago he exchanged his innocence , or ignorance , for wisdom , or guilt . Thus , sanity is simply the concealing of madness , and after centuries we have got pretty good at it . ( Girl enters with the tray again . The BLIND MAN picks up the egg-beater . The girl goes . He holds it up . ) This is an egg-beater , a toy for egg-eaters . The way it works is this . You turn this crank , and these blades go whirling around , making a sound that is not unpleasant to hear and ca n't hurt a fly . From this beginning has come the electrical mixer , in all of its various sizes and shapes , all drills , from the dentist 's to the oceanographer 's , the gramophone , the pencil-sharpener , automation in general , and the mechanical brain in particular . This brain is said to be capable of thinking , but so far the biggest one of all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States , a brain weighing ninety thousand tons and occupying an area larger than this theatre , has not even accidentally manufactured one thought that might be considered real , unique , original , or funny . Thus , the mechanical brain is only an egg-beater in another form . The egg-beater has been used only in those contemporary plays which affected absolute realism and consequently achieved a dull order of fantasy . Let us therefore put the egg-beater to work in this play , too ( MAN 'S WIFE is at TED 'S counter in the bank with a bowl . MAN stands near by. ) p. 77 MAN My name is John Edward George Henry London , and I am guilty  --  of  --  being a willing slave . I work all day , putting automobile motors together , one little part into one larger part , which in turn is put into a still larger part , until the whole automobile is turned over to a cheerful idiot in a red jacket who goes ninety miles an hour directly into a brick wall , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home at night in despair , only to hear my cheerful wife cheerfully whirling the egg-beater , making another omelet , because I once made the mistake of telling her she made the best omelets in the world , and fifteen years and five kids later , she still wants to bring romance back into our marriage . Well , it ca n't be done , can it ? But on she whirls and whirls , ever hopeful . WIFE Oh , hallo , dear . The omelet will be ready by the time you take a shower , and change your clothes . MAN Take a shower ? Change my clothes ? WIFE Yes , dear . And then I 've made plans for the evening . MAN You have ? What sort of plans ? WIFE Well . You know . A bottle of wine . Candlelight . Soft music . Our song .. ( Sings opening two lines of Rule , Britannia ! ) You know . MAN Do n't I , though ? p. 78 WIFE Do you like my dress ? It 's six years old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it 's as good as new . Do you like it ? MAN Yeah , sure . WIFE And I 've put six eggs in the omelet . MAN Six ! What 's that supposed to mean ? WIFE Do n't you remember ? MAN Ah , yes . Who could forget ? ( Sings a little of Rule , Britannia ! as he marches around the counter , puts his arms around her from the back , kisses her on the neck . She howls happily and whirls the egg-beater . He goes . She hands back the egg-beater , and goes . ) BLIND MAN It 's fun . Being a survivor , I mean . It 's good to be a survivor . But when I think of the millions who did n't make it , who were murdered , by us , I feel guilty all over again . ( TED and HORNIMAN take their places . ) But that 's another theme in another play , entirely . Back to this one , then . OWLETT Sam 's mad of course , and there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HORNIMAN What are you mumbling about , Mr. Owlett ? OWLETT Sam , sir . p. 79 HORNIMAN What about him ? OWLETT Sam 's mad , but of course we 're not , are we , Mr. Horniman ? HORNIMAN You have not been at the bank thirty years . You are not permitted to address me as Mr. Horniman . OWLETT Yes , sir . Why did you say two million pounds had been stolen when only half a million had , sir ? HORNIMAN Two million pounds were stolen . OWLETT Half a million by the robber , and a million and a half by you , sir ? HORNIMAN That 's right . OWLETT What did you do it for , sir ? It 's against the law to steal . HORNIMAN I know the law . I knew the law before you were born . OWLETT What did you do it for , sir ? HORNIMAN I might never again have such an excellent opportunity . OWLETT Sir , how did you do it , exactly ? I 've given the matter a great deal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , sir . HORNIMAN It was quite simple . The Bank of England sent me two million pounds . I delivered half a million to Sam , for which he signed a receipt . After the robbery , I changed the figures on the receipt from half a million to two million . p. 80 OWLETT Forgery , too , Mr. Horniman ? HORNIMAN The form , Mr. Owlett ! When will you understand the importance of the form . OWLETT Forgery , too , sir HORNIMAN No , not forgery at all . I simply erased the old figures and wrote in new ones . OWLETT ( With feigned admiration ) And then , sir ? HORNIMAN I took home the million and a half . They were defective in any case , as you know . Imagine the Chief Cashier G. O. Dodd , writing Good God instead . OWLETT Yes , sir , I did imagine it . HORNIMAN Hence I have both the million and a half defective plus the two million covered by the insurance , not defective . OWLETT Sir ? HORNIMAN Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't say sir , and stop . OWLETT Sir , now I 'm really beginning to understand banking . HORNIMAN You 're no good face to face with the public , and that 's the first thing a banker 's got to be . OWLETT Sir , the public likes me. p. 81 HORNIMAN They do ? OWLETT Yes , they do , sir . HORNIMAN Do they like me ? OWLETT No , they do n't , sir . HORNIMAN Why not ? OWLETT There 's something sneaky about you , sir . Crooked , clever , calculating , cagey , cruel . HORNIMAN Cruel , too ? OWLETT Sir , you are one of the cruellest nonentities of all time . HORNIMAN Well , it has n't been easy . OWLETT You 'd cheat your mother , sir . HORNIMAN She cheated me . OWLETT Sir , you 'd open the tight little fists of ragged children in the streets and take sticky candy out of their hands . HORNIMAN Candy 's not good for them . OWLETT Sir , you 'd leave the little children standing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HORNIMAN Tears act as a cleansing agent and keep their eyes healthy . OWLETT You are a criminal . HORNIMAN ( Blows up ) Mr. Owlett , unless you can respect the form of speech long established in this bank , I 'm afraid I must put you back to office boy . p. 82 OWLETT Sir , I can respect the form of speech , and I do respect it , sir . HORNIMAN But you forget again and again . OWLETT Sir , may I please have one more chance ? HORNIMAN One more chance , then , but see that you do n't forget again . OWLETT ( On his knees ) Oh , I wo n't , sir . Thank you , sir . HORNIMAN ( Taking him by the elbow . ) All right , now . Up on your feet . ( He helps TED up . ) Back to work , then . OWLETT Yes , sir . Thank you , sir . HORNIMAN Think about banking . Sam 's all right . He 's not crazy at all . OWLETT Yes , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HORNIMAN I know that foolish psychologist is trying to say Sam 's crazy , but I say the psychologist is crazy . Sam 's part of an international gang of crooks . We have no evidence that he 's not . Where 's the hold-up note , for instance ? Sam will deliberately stay crazy until he gets his cut of that stolen money . OWLETT Yes , sir . HORNIMAN Did you see any hold-up note ? p. 83 OWLETT See it sir ? HORNIMAN No , of course not . Nobody saw it , because there was none . It was Sam and his gang . OWLETT Yes , sir , Sam and his gang , sir . HORNIMAN Do your work , then . ( He goes . ) OWLETT I nearly lost my job again . ( The DOCTOR , the RUSSIAN and OVERBOARD enter . ) DOCTOR Unless we can make Sam jump , I 'm afraid he 's in serious trouble . Delusions of grandeur . Paranoia . Schizophrenia . OVERBOARD Make him jump ? DOCTOR Oh no , we 've got to encourage him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better in Russia . DOCTOR I 've read accounts of some of your experiments , and I must say they are impressive . Your method , as I understand it , is love , home , and work . Well , Sam is loved , and he is home , and so Sam ought to go back to work , but of course Mr. Horniman wo n't have him . If we can get Sam to jump , I 'm sure he 'll be eager to seek employment at another bank . OVERBOARD The police are not finished with Sam yet , Doctor . p. 84 DOCTOR Why not ? That boy never stole anything in his life . You know that , Inspector . OVERBOARD I 'm not saying he has , but it may very well be that Sam is part of something he himself does n't understand . The fact is I 'm baffled by the whole thing . I have no reason to do so , but I feel that Mr. Horniman is involved in the case in some way or another , and of course that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OVERBOARD Why not ? DATCHIKVILI I do n't know . Now how do we get Sam to jump ? DOCTOR Let me explain . And please do everything precisely as we plan . ( They go . ) ( FATHER FINNEGAN , FINNEGAN , carrying the Qantas satchel , comes back into the bank . He goes to TED 'S window , places a slip of paper on the counter . TED looks at him . Lifts the paper . ) OWLETT ( Reading ) Put all of the money into the Qantas satchel or expect the worst . A word to the wise is sufficient . Q. ( Aside ) If Horniman finds me with this , he 'll sack me . ( To FINNEGAN ) Did you write this ? FINNEGAN Oh no . I found it at the bottom of the satchel , and I thought I 'd better bring it back . Where 's the other boy ? p. 85 OWLETT Sam ? FINNEGAN Well , I do n't know his name . OWLETT Sam Hark-Harkalark . FINNEGAN I believe that belongs to him . OWLETT Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll give it to him . I know he 'll thank you for it . FINNEGAN If you will tell me where I may find him , I would like to give it to him myself . OWLETT ( Quickly ) Sam 's in Patagonia . He lives there . All of Sam 's people are Patagonians . Hark-Harkalark , that 's an old Patagonian name . FINNEGAN But you said you 'd give it to him . OWLETT By post . I 'd post it . Airmail . He 'd get it in the morning . Do n't worry about this little note , Sam 'll get this note out there in Patagonia and be glad to have it back . FINNEGAN I wanted him to know how much good his kindness did in a frequently unkind and unfeeling world . OWLETT I 'll write it all down in my letter . How much good in a frequently unkind and unfeeling . They do n't come like Sam any more . When they made Sam , they broke the mould . FINNEGAN And I wanted to shake his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , sir . I 'll shake hands for Sam any day . ( He shakes hands vigorously , at the same time watching for HORNIMAN . ) FINNEGAN I 'm flying home this afternoon after an absence of twenty-seven years , and I wanted to see one last time the only man I ever met who understood . OWLETT Yes , sir , I do n't understand the way Sam does , but I understand a little in my own way , and I 'll put that in the letter , too . Back to Australia ? FINNEGAN Oh no . I 'm from Dublin . Well , actually a little out of Dublin . Killiney . I 'll be there again long before the sun goes down . OWLETT Yes , sir , back in Killiney before the sun goes down . FINNEGAN Tell him  --  ( He stops . ) OWLETT Yes , sir ? FINNEGAN I would like him to pick up where I leave off . To give as he has given , and to go on giving , even when he has nothing . OWLETT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving , even nothing . I 'll tell him . FINNEGAN Thank you . OWLETT Glad to do it . p. 87 FINNEGAN ( In the middle of the bank looking around . ) I want to remember this holy place . OWLETT ( Nervously ) Yes , sir , holy . FINNEGAN Tell him OWLETT ( One desperate wave ) I 'll tell him everything . ( FINNEGAN goes as HORNIMAN arrives and watches him go . TED tries to make the hold-up note disappear but it remains in his hand . ) HORNIMAN Well , I see you 've been at work for a change , Mr. Owlett . OWLETT Yes , sir . I 've been very busy face to face with the public . HORNIMAN What was that last transaction ? OWLETT Sir , that last transaction was a deposit . HORNIMAN Well , you see , when you put your mind to work , you attract deposits . You attract them , just as Sam  --  ( He stops suddenly . ) Well , there you are . ( He gazes down at the tombstone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the most brilliant young men suddenly turn against their fathers , and join international gangs of thieves ? p. 88 OWLETT Sir , maybe Sam did n't join an international gang of thieves . Maybe Sam ought to have his place back , sir . HORNIMAN ( Slowly , dramatically . ) Do you think I have n't wanted to ask him back a thousand times ? I have . But no , no , not until he has confessed and paid his debt to society . Thirty or forty years at Wormwood Scrubs , but with good behaviour  --  ( Earnestly ) O Absolom , Absolom . Carry on . Attract another deposit . You 're not Sam , but you 're  --  OWLETT Ted , sir . Teddy . HORNIMAN ( Annoyed ) Never mind that Teddy stuff , Mr. Owlett . You 're a kind of rock . Simple and not very bright , but rocky . ( He looks at the tombstone again , shakes his head mournfully and goes . ) OWLETT There must be an easier way to get rich . ( He puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) ( SAM studies the cross-bar a moment , thinks deeply and suddenly makes a very good jump . He hears music from Capriccio Espagnol . ANN MOON comes running , kisses him , and runs off . SAM makes the jump again . The music again . Now , DAISY DIMPLE , in a razzle-dazzle costume , comes along . SAM takes one look , and extends an arm , stopping her. ) p. 89 DAISY Do n't you like me , Sam ? SAM Of course I like you , Miss Dimple . But I do n't want a Sex Bomb , who is n't anything else . DAISY But I 'm not just a Sex Bomb , Sam . I 'm an All-Around Bomb . A Cooking Bomb . A Sewing Bomb . I 've got white teeth , and good strong bones . SAM You 've got to be able to meet my intellectual friends , and they would n't expect you to dress like that . DAISY Do n't you like the way I look ? SAM I do , but what about my friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . All that low murmuring . They would n't understand you . DAISY But you understand me , do n't you , Sam ? SAM It 's not enough for me to understand you . My friends have got to understand you , too . DAISY Oh no , Sam , let them understand somebody else . SAM I 'm afraid it would n't work , Miss Dimple . I love Ann Moon , and we 're going to be married . DAISY You could marry Ann Moon , and marry me , too , could n't you ? I mean , like on the side ? SAM Oh no , I do n't want to be a blackguard . p. 90 DAISY It would be like you were two different Sams . One for her , and the blackguard for me . SAM But I ca n't be two different Sams . DAISY How do you know ? Like have you tried ? SAM Well , like I do n't want to , because if I can be two , I can be three or four , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sam . Like do n't decide now . ( She goes , moving slowly . ) ( SAM jumps again . Music . The AMBASSADOR stands . ) AMBASSADOR Sam . Now that you 've jumped higher than anybody else in the world , tell me  --  how does it feel to be famous ? SAM I was always famous . It 's just that I never before did anything spectacular to demonstrate it . AMBASSADOR Then you do n't really feel any different ? SAM I do n't think so . AMBASSADOR What about all the money you 've earned ? Has the money changed you ? SAM No , I do n't think so . AMBASSADOR But you do live in a mansion now , and you 've got a summer home in Tanganyika . p. 91 SAM Yes , I like to be where the lions are free . When lions are out of cages , when they 're home , they walk around as if the whole place had been made just for them . I like to see lions walking around that way . AMBASSADOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you do ? SAM All of it ? AMBASSADOR Every penny of it . SAM I 'd go back to work . AMBASSADOR But you 'd be awfully unhappy , would n't you ? SAM I 'd miss the lions a little . AMBASSADOR Not the money ? SAM I 'd miss the money , too , I suppose , but once you know you 're poor again , you know , do n't you ? AMBASSADOR I hope you wo n't mind my saying so , Sam , but I expected you to be a little more  --  well , eccentric . AMBASSADOR You mean crazy , do n't you ? SAM Well , yes , on account of the distorted stories in the papers . Is that what happened ? AMBASSADOR I do n't believe I 've noticed what happened . What did happen ? SAM Well , first the robbery , of course . Then , at the same time , your decision to jump higher than anybody else in the world , but your refusal to jump at all . And then suddenly your jump of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your tour around the world , jumping in every major city . Seven feet four inches in New York , four and a quarter in San Francisco , four and a half in Tokyo , five in Hong Kong , five and a half in Bombay , five and three-quarters in Athens , six in Rome , six and a half in Paris , seven in Berlin , seven feet seven and a quarter inches in Stockholm . All perfect jumps . And then in Moscow  --  total failure . p. 92 AMBASSADOR Total failure in Moscow ? SAM Well , I mean the first time . You knocked down the cross-bar . I think it 's understandable we felt you 'd been sabotaged . Especially after the Russians were so tactless as to bring out their best jumpers , and Malko Duzka of Alma-Ata cleared the bar at seven feet seven and three-quarter inches , breaking your record by half an inch . How did that happen , Sam ? SAM I told Malko how to do it . AMBASSADOR Why ? SAM I told all of the jumpers how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . AMBASSADOR What did you tell Malko ? SAM Whoop , zoop and over . The Japanese insisted on translations and interpretations , and so did a lot of other people , but Malko did n't . He understood immediately . AMBASSADOR Were n't you annoyed when he broke your record ? SAM No , I was glad . I hope he breaks it again . AMBASSADOR Not much chance of that , Sam . You went back to Karl Marx Stadium the following night in Moscow and cleared the bar at seven feet nine inches . SAM I wanted to give Malko and all the other jumpers of the future something to work for . p. 93 AMBASSADOR At seven feet nine inches were you worried you might not be able to make it ? SAM Yes , I was . AMBASSADOR You did n't want to let England down ? SAM Well , yes , but it 's not that alone . I did n't want this method of extending the human limits to fail , for any of us . And I was worried I might not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on account of the politics and propaganda that had come into the whole thing . Too many people were telling me I had to do it for England , and France , and Italy , and America , and the white race , and democracy , and freedom , and of course high jumping does n't have anything to do with all those trade marks . AMBASSADOR Trade marks ? SAM Yes , just like Bovril , Guinness , Schweppes , and all the others . AMBASSADOR You could n't concentrate ? SAM Not the way I wanted to , because I began to believe in the trade marks . The people who wanted me to believe in them were such decent people , you know . They were n't fools . They were great men , some of them . And they believed in the trade marks , not blindly or unreasonably , but intelligently . They did n't mean to do it , but they made things awfully difficult for me in Moscow . It got so bad I began to believe I would n't be able to clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches . p. 94 AMBASSADOR But you did clear it at seven feet nine inches . SAM Because before jumping I said that if I did clear it , it would be because I was jumping for people  --  for all people . And not for any government . And of course nobody was happier than Malko Duzka himself . AMBASSADOR Sam , may I ask a very difficult question ? SAM Sure . AMBASSADOR What are we to do ? All of us ? All over . The world 's smaller than ever and the weapons are greater than ever . Now , what are we to do ? SAM We do n't really have any choice , do we ? We have got to put up with ourselves , have n't we ? AMBASSADOR Yes , but how ? SAM By not being afraid of one another , and by not scaring ourselves in trying to scare others . AMBASSADOR Individuals , or governments ? SAM Both . AMBASSADOR One last question . Without war can the world economy be maintained ? That is the question . SAM ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( SAM goes off. ) p. 95 BLIND MAN ( Enters ) Well , there 's the theatre for you , and there 's nothing like it . The last arena in which everything is still possible . Well , Sam 's winning his fight , as we have seen . He has n't jumped higher than anybody else in the world , but he has jumped , and he may now be willing to believe that he can not jump higher than anybody else in the world , or he may decide that he does n't want to . We do n't know , but we 'll soon find out . ( He goes . ) ( SAM , dressed , comes in with a satchel . His GRANDFATHER , wearing a News of the World sign , comes in . ) SAM ( Quietly ) Are you finished for the day , Grandpa ? GRANDPA No , I 've got to go back for a couple more hours , but I want to be here when they arrive . SAM Let 's not have any good-byes , shall we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SAM I do n't mind . GRANDPA I do . SAM If I 'm crazy , I 'm crazy . I did n't invent it . GRANDPA You 're a great man . SAM No , I 'm not . p. 96 GRANDPA Well , if you 're not , nobody is . Nobody ever has been . SAM A little maybe , inside . But I want to forget all about it , the same as everybody else . GRANDPA But you 're not everybody else . You 're Sam . No matter what happens , I want you to remember that . At first I wanted you to change back . To be the way you had been . But not any more . Whatever you do , do n't change . Do n't give over , like I did , like your father did , like everybody does . Giving over is even worse than being mad , Sam . ( The DOCTOR , OVERBOARD and DATCHIKVILI are brought in by SAM 'S GRANDMOTHER . SAM 'S GRANDFATHER seizes SAM 'S satchel . ) DOCTOR Not in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you to ask Sam any more questions , Doctor . DOCTOR I want to help Sam . GRANDPA I do n't want you to help him . DOCTOR Sam 's condition indicates the need of urgent therapeutic measures . GRANDPA I know all about Sam 's condition . Unlike the rest of us , he 's decently mad . We 're just sad mad . DOCTOR I have had the authority for more than a week to take Sam away , but I have deliberately chosen not to exercise that authority . p. 97 GRANDPA Do n't speak that silly language of intimidation in this house , sir . I sat and talked with Sam until three this morning . Now , I 'm going to ask you in a nice way to get out of here . SAM No , Grandpa , I do n't want him to get out . Ask me any question you like , Doctor . DOCTOR I do n't want to upset your grandfather , Sam . SAM Ask me anything . GRANDPA There 's only one question to ask , Sam . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than anybody else in the world ? SAM Yes , I do . DOCTOR ( Looks from one face to another . ) Well , I will go now , and I give you my word , sir , Sam will not be taken away from you until you ask that he be . GRANDPA Perhaps the doctor ought to be asked to stay with Sam a little longer . GRANDPA Do you want the doctor to stay ? GRANDPA Yes , I do . GRANDPA Do you , Sam ? SAM Yes , Grandpa . GRANDPA And if he believes you must be taken away ? p. 98 SAM How far away can anybody be taken ? We 're all here somewhere or other . Inspector , I do n't know anything more about the robbery than I 've already told you . OVERBOARD I know that , Sam . We 're at work on a number of other clues . SAM And , Doctor , I am mad . GRANDPA No , Sam , do n't say that . SAM I know I am , Doctor , better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my madness . And you can only know or imagine your own . What do you want to do ? DOCTOR What do you want to do , Sam ? Everybody here wants to help you . We even want to help you jump higher than anybody else . ( SAM turns . ) It is n't really impossible at all , Sam . When I said it was , I spoke foolishly . It is possible for you to jump seven feet , perhaps higher . And it may even be necessary for you to do so . If it is , we want to help you . But you must not jump now . Even two feet . SAM Why not ? DOCTOR Oh , I know you want to , but do n't do it , Sam . You 're like a tiger who 's got to leap across a great deep canyon . It 's awfully far across . If you do n't make it , you 're gone . You 've got to look across and keep looking . p. 99 SAM ( Looks at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to jump , too . You think you 're ready , but you 're not . ( SAM stands , very relaxed . The DOCTOR looks at OVERBOARD and DATCHIKVILI . ) Hold him ! Do n't let him jump ! ( They seize SAM suddenly , and they all fall . SAM gets up . ) SAM What 's the matter with you blokes ? DOCTOR Well , I guess our little scheme failed , Sam . You might as well know we tried to trick you into jumping . SAM You want me to jump ? DOCTOR Yes , of course . SAM Why ? DOCTOR Well , if you would jump , we 'd know you 're all right again . SAM ( Jumps quickly . ) Like this ? DOCTOR How the devil did that happen ? But you just said you still believe you can jump higher than anybody else in the world . SAM I still do , but I do n't want to any more . On account of my talk with my grandfather last night . DOCTOR Case closed . Patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding , sir . I am a member of a profession it is impossible not to dislike now and then , but we have only three choices , God , family , or the psychiatrist . Last night you and Sam chose the family . It is a good choice . ( He goes quickly . OVERBOARD and DATCHIKVILI nod and go . SAM 'S GRANDFATHER goes. ) p. 100 SAM ( Takes down the high jump . ) Well , we 're almost home now , and so are you . AMBASSADOR Is this the end ? SAM Well , actually , there is no end . There never is . We just like to start somewhere , and so of course we have got to stop somewhere . Anywhere will do . AMBASSADOR But so much is still unfinished . SAM Yes , that 's how it always is . But soon morning comes , and we start all over again . ( On the other side of the stage TED is at his counter . ) ( OVERBOARD and DATCHIKVILI bring HORNIMAN out of his office . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a hundred times , do n't say sir , and stop . What is it , Mr. Owlett ? OWLETT Why are the police holding your arms , sir ? HORNIMAN That 's precisely what I would like to know , Mr. Owlett . OVERBOARD You 're under arrest , Mr. Horniman . OWLETT Oh , no , you ca n't arrest him . He 's the President of the bank . p. 101 DATCHIKVILI He is also a thief . HORNIMAN This is entirely the consequence of a misconception . No crime has been committed . A mistake has been made . OVERBOARD Shall we go ? OWLETT Sir , they 're taking you away . HORNIMAN Gentlemen , will you please be good enough to listen to my faithful clerk . OVERBOARD Have you something to say , Mr. Owlett ? HORNIMAN Tell them , Mr. Owlett . OWLETT Me ? Tell them ? HORNIMAN Yes , of course . My life 's at stake . Tell them . ( He kneels . ) Ted . Teddy . Give me one more chance . OWLETT This is entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed . A mistake has been made . HORNIMAN ( Gets up . ) There , gentlemen . May I go , now ? OVERBOARD I 'm afraid not . Actually , we solved the case soon after the robbery . It was simply a matter of getting the evidence , which we now have . OWLETT Who robbed the bank ? OVERBOARD Mr. Horniman robbed the bank of a million and a half pounds . We found the money under his bed in a satchel. p. 102 HORNIMAN It was n't me . OWLETT It was n't him . HORNIMAN You will be promoted in the morning . It was n't my bed . OWLETT It was n't his bed . HORNIMAN You will be Vice-President in the morning . It was n't my satchel . OWLETT It was n't his satchel . HORNIMAN ( To OVERBOARD , annoyed ) I hope you 're satisfied . All this humiliation in front of the whole world . There you are . The truth of the matter . My own clerk . OVERBOARD Mr. Owlett will be expected to testify at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We must think of the public , above all things . OVERBOARD We are thinking of the public , Mr. Horniman . Come along . HORNIMAN One moment , please . Gentlemen , you are both men of the world . In the interest of the national economy , which will surely be undermined by a sensational trial , full of misunderstandings , distortions , clever legal questions , bewilderment , confusion , photographs , first person singular stories in the Mirror , Sketch , and Graphic : do n't do this thing . You have a wife and three small children , I believe . p. 103 OVERBOARD And another coming . HORNIMAN I am prepared to undertake full responsibility for their well-being . OVERBOARD So am I. HORNIMAN For every pound you are prepared to lavish upon these dear ones , the future statesmen , bankers , and captains of industry of proud England , I am prepared to lavish two . OVERBOARD Shall we go ? HORNIMAN Three , sir . ( To DATCHIKVILI ) And you , Captain , from beyond the iron curtain , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia we would ask you four thousand funny questions . OVERBOARD Come along , now . HORNIMAN Sound the alarm , Mr. Owlett . Ca n't you see the bank is being robbed . OWLETT But the last time we sounded the alarm , it played Swan Lake . HORNIMAN I pray you , sir . Sound the alarm . ( TED presses the alarm button . This time the music is from " Le Cid " by Massenet . ) HORNIMAN ( Loudly , over the music ) You see me here , ye Gods , one of the mighty falling , a poor old man , as full of grief as age , wretched in both . If it be you that turn these hearts against their father , fill me with noble anger . But soft ! How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank . What violent light out yonder circles and breaks amidst the galaxy ? It is the East . The stars , the moon , the sun , undone . All undone . p. 104 SAM End of Act Two , and end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the London Comedy . AMBASSADOR What about Act Three ? SAM That 's outside , where we shall all soon be . Good-bye , then . God bless , good luck , until we meet again . ( He shakes hands with the AMBASSADOR who goes across the orchestra pit . ) On with the world , then . Thank you very much . OVERBOARD Shall we go , then ? HORNIMAN ( Being dragged away ) A misconception , gentlemen . A misconception . ( WALLY WAILER plays and sings " We Were Only Having Fun " , and the whole company sings and dances , as the curtain comes down. )
