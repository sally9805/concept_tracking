txt CAPE KENNEDY , Fla. , Thursday , June ** prep- arations were pushed here early today for the start at 101 A.M. Eastern daylight time of this country 's most ambitiousl space venture to date . Fueling was completed during the night for a 62-orbit flight in which , it is hoped , an orbiting rocket stage will be approached , inspected arid perhaps even touched . If the rocket stage is sailing smoothly through space , Maj. Edward H. White 2d of the Air Force , floating free on a tether , may propel himself with a space gun close enough to reach out and feel it . It is more probable that the rocket will be tumbling too fast to permit such a bold attempt . With sharp fixtures on either end , it could be lethal to an astronaut whose life depends on a fragile , oxygen-inflated spacesuit . Second Gemini Flight The rocket will be the second and final stage of the Titan 2 vehicle , which is to place in orbit the two-man spacecraft . Major White 's excursion into raw space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , known as Gemini 4 , will be the second of the manned Gemini vehicles . The first made a three-orbit flight on March 23 and proved so successful in its space maneuvers that a far more ambitious program has been outlined for Gemini 4 . If the latter 's scheduled maneuvers are carried out , feats will have been achieved that the Russians apparently have not yet attempted  --  feats with military as well as scientific significance . These include maneuvering close to another vehicle in orbit , inspection and photography of that vehicle by a free-floating astronaut and personal maneuvers in space with a space gun . The space gun is a device that conjures up memories of Buck Rogers and other comic strip heroes . It squirts a jet of compressed oxygen , pushing the free-floating astronaut through space . After he steps out of the hatch , Major White will continue to orbit with the vehicle . Hence he will coast along with it through the near vacuum , of space . Only a gentle push will be needed to send him one way or another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet cosmonaut who is the only man so far to leave his capsule to float in space . When he tugged at his tether to return to the ship he came back so fast that he had to fend himself off . This spun the ship one way and he slipped off in , the other direction . Soviet Difficulties Another difficulty on that Soviet flight , of which the American astronauts are mindful , was that for a while , in space , Colonel Leonov apparently could not find his vehicle . He had spun a few times head over heels and . peering out through the visor of his stiff , tightly inflated suit , he could not see the craft , Voskhod 2 . The instructions to Major White are to keep an eye continuously on Gemini 4 . Furthermore . Maj. James A. of the Air Force . the spaceship commander . will keep an eye on his companion and maneuver the ship so that Major White will remain in front , visible through the windshield . The flight , if all goes well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . The Gemini cabin is so small , for such a prolonged journey ' that a number of items will be , jettisoned to reduce the clutter- : ing . These include a half-dozen de-1 vices not needed after Major ' ' White makes his side trip into , spare : two extra visors for hisl helmet . special mittens. the 25-j foot tether. the bag in which ; the cord was originally stowed . ' the chest pack with its emer- , gency air supply and possibly ' the space gun . Later , as the days wear on , and more and more food pack-1 ages are opened , the astronautsl may again release the oxygen from their cabin and open theJ hatch to throw out the food wrappers . There are , as yet , no fines for littering in space . While this debris would nor-1 orally stay close to the vehicle the astronauts can easily pull , away from it by firing some of l the small rockets constituting , , the Orbit Attitude and Maneuver I System . It is this OA MS system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projected for the initial orbits . More Realistic Test In any event , the debris tossed ' out will not remain in orbit long . The fringes of the atmosphere will clutch at it and soon drag it down to disintegrate on re-entry . Major White 's encounter with the booster rocket will not be a full-fledged test of redezvous techniques , because it is not planned that Gemini 4 stray far from the rocket during the first two orbits . Normally , after launching , the Gemini would pull away from its booster , entering a quite different orbit . In this , case the astronauts will try to , keep it within a quarter of a , mile all the way around , approaching , within 20 feet to- , ward the end of the second orH bit so that Major White can climb out and attempt an inspection . A more realistic test of ren- , dezvous will take place at the start of the fifth orbit , about , 4 P.M. By then the astronauts will have altered the shape of their orbit sufficiently to depart 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasks is to photograph the booster rocket as it coasts in orbit . No close-up pictures have ever been obtained of such a rocket after it has performed its task . The camera Major White will use , provided by the Department of Defense , will will be fastened to his space suit . One of the fears has been that the rocket and Gemini 4 jI would develop opposite electric charges . It was proposed that I this might result from the interlaction of each object with the l thin , ionized wisps of air at that altitude or from the firing of altitude rockets . If Major White carried such Jan electric charge , like someone Iwho has walked a wool carpet on a dry day , it was feared that ja spark might jump between jhim and the rocket , setting off the latter 's destruction charge . Such charges are incorporated ' in the design for activation by radio command if the rocket misbehaves . However , the project officials dimissed all such suggestions. , Because the thin air at that height is ionized , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could no accumulate on either vehicle , they said . The ionization is caused by separation of electrons front atoms of the high atmosphere . The 62-orbit flight will not be the longest of the space age . Soviet Maj. Andrian G. Nikolayev completed 64 orbits in a solo flight in August , 1962 . It will be by far the longest two-man flight , however . The best Soviet tandem effort was 17 orbits in March by Colonel Leonov and Col. Pavel I. Belyayer.
