txt Columbia University has issued a charter to a student group that seeks equal rights for homosexuals . The organization , called the Student Homophile League , is reported to have about a dozen members , and it says it has both homosexual and heterosexual members . A girl from Barnard is reported to be a member . According to the chairman of the Student Homophile League , this is the first such group ever chartered by a college in this country . He says that charters will be sought at other colleges including Stamford , the University of Chicago , the University of California at Berkeley , the University of Connecticut . Trinity , Bucknell and the University of Maryland . The chairman , who used the pseudonym Stephen Donaldson , said in a telephone interview last night that the organization had been formed because " we wanted to get the academic community to support equal rights for homosexuals . " Before the university issued the charter , there were delays because the league refused to give the names of its officers and of five members . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names were supplied with the , understanding they would be kept confidential . The charter was issued by the Committee on Student Organizations , which is made up of student and faculty officials . The chairman of the committee , Dr. Harold E. Lowe . assistant to the vice pr.ssident cf refused the petition until the names were supplied . Dr. Lowe said last night that before the charter was granted the eight names submitted by tie leagtle were checked and found to be students. ? " It is a bona fide student organization , " he said , " and we saw no reason why , we should turn down the request for a charter . " The head of the Student Homophile ' League said last night , in reply to a question , that before he first began campaigning for a charter his roommates had asked him to move from their quarters after they learned he was homosexual . " But I should say , " he added , " that they asked me with great apologies and said they realized , they should n't feel that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The chairman of the league . who said he is bisexual , moved . He said that thif , incident was not the reason he decided to try to charter the Student Homophile League . ' It was just the general situation that prompted this , " he said . In their effort to get the charter , the league members conferred frequently with the Rev. John D. Cannon , chaplain of the university . The Episcopalian said in an interview yesterday that he pointed out to them that as members of such an organization they might subject themselves , eventually , to dangers of discrimination . " They look upon this as a civil libertarian organization , " he said . " To my knowledge there has been no adverse reaction among the faculty . " However , there has been a mixed reaction among the students , as indicated by letters that followed the appearance of the story in school 's paper , The Columbia Spectator , on April 27 . " At first , " said Charles L. Skoro. who wrote the story in The Spectator , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April Fool hoax , but now they realize it is for real . " An editorial in the college daily has praised the action , which has been defended and attacked in letters from students . In its declaration r'f principles . the league lists 13 points , including the fellowing : C " The homosexual has fundamental human right to live and to work with his fellow man as an equal in their common quest for the betterment of human society . " q " The homosexual has a ! fundamental human right to develop arid achieve his full poten-tia and dignity as a human cbieeitnyg. , , and member of human soThe declaration then says that " the homosexual is being unjustly , inhumanly and savagely discriminated against by large segments of American society . The first discussions among the students that led to the charter began about a year ago . For several months , according to the chairman , it operated as a completely " underground group .

Three days later , the group began the first of a series of talks with the Committee on Student Organizations . The hitch developed on submission of the names of the three officers and five other members . Finds were said to have been supplied for the organization by some Columbia alumni who were reported to have learned about it from advertisements in magazines for homosexuals . The chairman of the league says it is not controlled by any other group but " maintains liaison " with homosexual groups . With permission of the chaplain , the league has been using his office for meetings when he is not working there . In trx sessions since obtaining a chillter , the league has considered the possibility of how to gh about opening a drive for mem ? bers . This is admittedly difficult since the members now in the league are trying to conceal their identities .
