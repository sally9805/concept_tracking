txt Ministers of the European Common Market today accepted an A-nerlean Kennedy round proposal on grains and in so doing came near a solution to this vital area of the trade liberalization negotiations . Differences between the United States and the Common Market in grains and chemicals had threatened at several points in the four-year-old negotiations to lead to Kennedy round failure . In Geneva earlier this week , while the Kennedy round hung in the balance , a Swedish diplomat , Nils Montan , brought the chief United States and Common Market negotiators together at lunch where they were ' able to resolve differences ' that had threatened to end the talks . Details on Page 67 . Major Issue Tomorrow the ministers discuss chemicals , where Ameri-i can protectionism is the major issue . The effect of today 's agree-1 ment is to brighten considerably the prospects for a successful Oonclusion to the negotiations on Sunday , the deadline the 53 participating nations have , given themselves . ? Success would mean that over the next five years the world would see the biggest round of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would mean cheaper imports . For example , Volkswagens would probably cost less in the United States , and French cheeses and Swiss watches and Japanese cameras ? unless of course the middle man is able to pocket the profits . Trade Increase It would probably mean a big increase for world trade , which has already been expanding rapidly in the postwar years . But economic advantages are not all the Kennedy round would bring . There could be portant political effects . The major aiin of the late President Kennedy when he got his Trade Expansion . Act through Congress was to liberalize trade between Europe and // the United States and thus strengthen the foundations of the Atlantic Alliance . The alliance is not so solid as it was , but this has not changed the original political objectives . Failure of the Kennedy round could have given the forces , of protectionism the upper hand on both sides of the Atlantic with dangerous political consequences . Special Authority The Trade Expansion Act gave the President special authority to enter into multilateral trade negotiations , hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide in grains , the American chief negotiator , William M. Roth , decided yesterday to trim the American demands at the same time it meant the community would have to trim its demands . The compromise , which drastically reduces the scope of a new international grain agreement that is part of the Kennedy round negotiations , was brought to the ministers today by Common Market chief negotiator Jean Rey , a member of the Common Market commission and the man strongly tipped to be its new president . For years the Americans had been saying that as part of - the grains agreement they had to have guaranteed access for their farmers in the community market . Agreeable to Access The community was willing to grant this access , binding it at a. level , however , that was well below what grain exportnations , such as the United States , ? Canada , Australia and Argentina now enjoy . The Americans demanded 13 per cent of the market for exporters , which is what the exporters now have . The community said this was unacceptable because under new farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , want to expand their production . The community was willing to grant 10 per cent , or possibly 11 per cent . Each percentage point represents about 700 , - 000 tons of grain . Senate Opposed The American Senate , which would have to ratify a grains treaty , would never accept 10 per cent . Both positions were firm and it became clear there would be no grains agreement without some give . So Mr. Roth decided to remove the access requirement ' from the grains package . Without a grains agreement , the Americans said there would ' be no Kennedy round . Removal of access left only two major American demands ? a. somewhat higher world price for wheat and an undertaking by the industrialized countries such as the Common Market member states  --  France , West Germany , Italy , Belgium , the Netherlands and Luxembourg ? to give wheat to the hungry , countries as part of an international food aid program . World Market For its part , the community had been demanding strict organization of the entire world market in grains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a world price fixed for secondary feed . grains . These demands were unacceptable to the United States . They were dropped today by the Common Market in accepting the American compromise . Thus , what will emerge from the Kennedy round will be simply a three-year extension of the existing international wheat agreement , where only the world price is controlled , together with the additional element of food aid . World Price On a new world price , . both the community and the United States are fairly close together . They both agree to figures in the area of $1.71 to $1.74 a bushel . Canada and Australia want a higher price ; Japan and Britain , major importers , a lower one . But it looks as if the new world price will average out somewhere in the American . community range . In food aid , it is also a question of bringing figures already on the table a little closer together . Americans are asking for a program of five million to six million tons . Common Market ministers have agreed to three million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering 4,500,000-tons in which the community share would be 22 per cent , or about one million tons . Mr. Rey had been given flexibility to make such offers as part of his negotiating mandate from the ministers . The Common Market accepted the American compromise with some regret . It has always held that solution to commodity problems lay in the organiza-f tion of markets on a global scale . The grains compromise is clearly a minimum solution . Sicco Mansholt , a Dutchman who is the top agricultural expert ' on the Common Market commission , told newsmen tonight the community had a " long-term political ' solution " while the United States had a " short-term commercial proposition . " The American move in withdrawing access requirement was seen by most observers here as a particularly astute one , for with a minimum grains agreement without the full-scale organization of markets , the Common Market is left committed to an accord signed in 1962 pledging it to take " appropriate " measures to remedy any decline in imported hard winter wheat .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
