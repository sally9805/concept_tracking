txt HUE , South Vietnam , Friday , May ** students sacked and burned the United States cultural center and library in this city yesterday in the most violent outburst of anti-Americanism since the current political crisis began 10 weeks ago . The burning was widely interpreted here as a sign that the leaders of the anti-Government movement  --  Thich Tri Quang , the militant Buddhist mqnk , and Lieut . Gen. lsiguyen Chanh Thi , who was remo+ed as I Army Corps commander ? were growing desperate . Student leaders said they had attacked the cultural center because of American support for the governing junta and because they had received no reply to a letter of protest they sent to President Johnson Wednesday night . American sources said that the letter had been forwarded to Washington but that no answer was forthcoming . In Saigon , the South Vietnamese Foreign Minister , Tran Van Do , expressed the " consternation and sincere regrets " of the Government for the assault on the cultural center . Page 4 .

An American official said that " the will and ability of these troops : o defend us is somewhat luestionable . " This morning a column of 125 3uddhist monks and nuns was // temporarily halted by the troops two blocks from the consulate . After a few minutes , however , the soldiers - helped the Buddhists push aside barbedwide barricades . When . . the marchers arrived in front of the consulate , , they ? began ' a 48-hour hunger ' strike . Two monks cut their chests with razor blades and ' wrote in blood messages to ?

In yesterday 's - attack , the rampaging students smashed windows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even pried the brass letters identifying the library from the facade of the modern two-story concrete structure . Almost all the 10,000 volumes were destroyed . One long-haired teen-ager hurled a dozen steel chairs through the glass front of a large bookcase . Others gleefully smashed a tinted portrait of President Johnson . At least 40 South Vietnamese civilian and military policemen ' and combat troops sat or stood on the sidewalk during the methodical dismantling ' of the th building , which was the object of a Buddhist attack in . February , 1965 . They made no attempt to interfere and refused to telephone the Fire Department . No one was in the building when about 1,000 students arrived at 4:20 P.M. The director , Albert Ball of Los Angeles , had received a warning that the attack was imminent and had ordered an emergency evacuation . James R. Bullington , the acting United States consul at Hue , which is 440 miles northeast of Saigon , declined to comment on the incident . Other officials said it almost certainly meant the end of the American cultural program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Answer ' About 100 students staged a hunger strike outside the consulate yesterday and today . At 10 A.M. they joined 6,000 townspeople in a colorful funeral procession for Lieut . ' Nguyen Dai Thuc , the Vietnamese officer killed here May 17 by a machine-gunner in an American helicopter . The lieutenant had been attempting to assassinate a Government official . ' The students asked Mr. Bullington to observe a- ceremony marking the end of their . hunger strike and to give them Mr. Johnson 's answer . Standing in the driveway in front of the consulate , he gave them instead a copy of the President 's statement . at a weekend news conference in Washington : " That is no proper answer , " a. student leader said . " We shall have to take . stronger action . " " If you have something ' to say , say it , " the consular official replied , his lips trembling with anger . " I do not appreciate receiving ill-concealed threats . " Again the students asked him to attend the ceremony , but Mr. Bullington ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we , are too busy . " After a heated meeting in the auditorium of the science faculty at the University of Hue , the students marched three blocks to the cultural center . At the head of the procession was a student carrying a Vietnamese flag and two others bearing a blue banner that ? said : " Down with the American protectors of the Ky clique . " Nguyen Van Dien , a 26-yearold medical student wearing a tobacco brown polo shirt , jumped onto the parapet in front of the building and began issuing orders . He sent about 40 students into the library and kept the rest at some distance from the building by shouting , blowing a whistle and brandishing a .45-caliber pistol . The 40 students raced through the library , smashing plateglass doors , windows and bookcases , carrying armsfull of books into the court and , ripping ' posters from the walls . Soon there was a huge pile of tables , chairs , books , newspapers and other debris in the courtyard . On the top were a switchboard , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books ? " The Story of Our Flag , " " Kennedy , " and " The T.V.A. Today . " Mr. Dien doused the pile with gasoline and set it afire . Within minutes the flames had spread to the wooden bookcases inside , and the corrugated metal auditorium roof had collapsed . While other students ransacked Mr. Ball 's second-floor office , throwing couches and chairs into the street , those who had stayed outside pelted the Ibuilding with stones . - ? Every window was smashed . Mr. Ball had seemed more resigned than angry when a Vietnamese woman tiptoed into his office to whisper that the center was about to be attacked . While his office burned Mr. Ball watched from his jeep parked nearby . Nearly all of the attackers were young men . A few serene looking Vietnamese girls , dressed in the flowing national costume and holding pastel parasols , smiled their approval from a relatively safe distance . A fire truck finally rolled up almost an hour after the attack began , but- even then the firemen made no attempts to put , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby houses . The fires burned for more than four hours . Premier Ky has ' isolated Hue by stationing a battalion of 500 marines at a pass 38 miles south of here .
