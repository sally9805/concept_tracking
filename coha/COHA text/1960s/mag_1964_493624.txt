. Conspiracy on the Right The National Director of Public Relations for the John Birch Society , former Congressman John H. Rousselot , says that a " substantial number " of the Society 's membership are policemen . He may be exaggerating , or not have meant what he said . Nevertheless , it was learned last week that Birchers have tried to gain control of the Santa Ana , California , police department . They are engaged , an investigator reports , in " a power play to get the chief and replace him with someone over whom they could exercise control " ; the chief has been the victim of anonymous phone calls before dawn , fire trucks sent to his home on false alarms , unordered flowers sent to him COD , and the theft of his badges . In Philadelphia too , 14 or 15 policemen are known to be members of the Society , and the mayor has said that henceforth they will be given restricted duty . We are dealing here with a six-year-old , semi-secret society ; " a monolithic body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who adds that it operates under " completely authoritative control at all levels . " Membership dues for men are $24 a year , for women $12 . Membership may be revoked at any time by a duly-appointed officer of the society , " without the reason being stated . " Directives are passed along through a monthly Bulletin . Members are encouraged to infiltrate such organizations as the PTA , to harass speakers at meetings , to create front organizations ( such as the Committee to Impeach Earl Warren or the Committee to Investigate Communist Influences at Vassar College ) . Membership figures are confidential , but one good estimate is that they have doubled in the past year and are now slightly over 50,00o . In 1963 in California , the Society had 300 chapters ; today in that state it is believed to have 724 . Onehundred-and-sixty people seem to be employed on its national staff . In a report filed in 1962 with the Commission of Charities in Massachusetts , the Society stated that it had that year an income of $8z6,000 ; in 1963 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But in the December , 1963 , Bulletin , Mr. Welch said : " At the end of 1963 , we are running at the level of expenses of approximately $2 million a year , " and that the Society was " pouring printed materials of the very best quality for the purpose out of here at the average rate of $20,000 worth in retail value every week , and getting it sold and read . " Mr. Rousselot 's idea that " there is absolutely nothing wrong with police being members of the John Birch Society " deserves scrupulous examination . If the Society were merely an educational association interested in the problems ( or evils ) of Communism , Mr. Rousselot 's view would be hard to refute . But the Society appears to be much more than that . We say " appears , " because so much is shadowy . We do know from the Society 's literature that it is " political " in quite a different sense than , say , the Republican Party . In spirit and structure it resembles the American Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today a membership in the neighborhood of io , 000 . But it 's a free country . Why pick on cops'for joining anything ? There is a practical and important reason why . When any significant number of citizens lose confidence in the fairness , the impartiality of its police ( or military ) force , trouble is inevitable . If the public has reason to suspect that guardians of law and order ? in New York City or St. Augustine , Florida ? are refractory or biased , the public peace itself is put in jeopardy . And can one doubt that a great many citizens suspect the fairness and impartiality of members of an organization whose founder believes that " Milton Eisenhower is a Communist and has been for 3o years " ; who thinks it " beyond any reasonable doubt " that " Dwight Eisenhower is a dedicated conscious agent of the Communist conspiracy ... " ; or who could say in 1961 that " Communist influences are now in almost complete control of our federal government " ? What place have policemen in a clandestine organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republican Party , wrote in 1961 : " We hope to increase our impact tremendously on the political scene , through education of others and dedication of ourselves , in 1962 and especially by 1964 . . . . What is not only needed , but is absolutely imperative , is For some hard-boiled , dictatorial and dynamic boss to come along to deliver himself approximately as follows . . . . ' You fellows , over there , all of you , get the heaviest clubs you can find , spread yourselves out no more thinly than you have to along the whole length of this wall , and do n't hesitate to break the heads of any saboteurs you find monkeying with it . Do n't even hesitate to break the heads of those you find creeping toward the wall , if you are sure of their evil intentions , just as a warning to the rest of the dirty gang ' . " When Mr. Rousselot says that " police membership is a private matter , " he is in error . It is like the error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it altogether wrong for public authorities ever to inquire into the associations of government employees . It is of concern to constituted authorities if a cadre exists within a law enforcement unit with private aims sharply at variance with those of constituted authority . The fact that there is no constitutional right to be a policeman is , however , an irrelevancy . Everyone , police-man or not , has a constitutional right to be dealt with fairly by government . Because that right is fundamental , no member of any police department ought to be disciplined or discharged without having had a full and fair hearing in which his exact connection with the Society is ascertained . But then what ? Membership in or association with a group can not be grounds for taking away a man 's job or demoting him , unless the activities of the group in question are plainly proved to be incompatible with a man 's official duties . That has not yet been plainly , and publicly proved . It can not be unless the full story of the John Birch Society is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it imposes , what in practice it does ; in brief , we need a responsible investigation of the conspiratorial Right , centering on the John Birch Society , but extending to the Minutemen , whose leader , Robert Bolivar DePugh , announced on November 4 that , " the hopes of millions of Americans that the Communist tide could be stopped with ballots instead of bullets have turned to dust . " The Minutemen boast of between 25,000 to 46,000 members ; again , no outsider knows how close to the truth these figures are . We do know that no tenet of democracy requires that the state tolerate within its borders paramilitary organizations . But who has the subpoena power , the standing , the staff ? and the objectivity ? to carry forward such an inquiry ? Representative Charles Joelson ( D , N.J. ) has proposed a " deep and thorough " investigation of the Minutemen by the House Un-American Activities Committee . But HUAC is a discredited body , incapable of commanding general confidence , unless it receives a massive transfusion of new blood ? new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of witnesses . No mayor , or even a state attorney general , has sufficient authority to gather in the necessary evidence on all these national organizations . The Civil Rights Commission could perhaps usefully explore one group ? the Ku Klux Klan ? with special attention to the role its members have in police work . The Commission at least begins with the advantage of having a model procedural code . It would not publish suspicion as fact , leak private testimony to the press , give no chance for anyone to rebut evidence . But a broader inquiry is in order , one conducted by a special committee , bipartisan in character , of either the House , the Senate or both . If there are conspiracies on the Right , let 's find out how they operate , what they want , and how they are financed . It may be said that The New Republic is calling for a return to snooping and spying by government ; in brief to " McCarthyism . " If the investigation proposed here were conducted as Joe McCarthy ran his , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 5o 's need not be repeated . NOVEMBER 28 , 1964 Perils of the UN A solution of the debt issue that threatens to disrupt the United Nations ? the Russians and their satellites are refusing to pay assessments for the cost of UN peace-keeping operations in the Congo and the Middle East , and the United States insists that if they do not they should lose their voting rights in the General Assembly ? may be found as this issue of The New Republic goes to press . What , however , seems more likely is that the crisis will be kept up through December , right to the last possible minute of the eleventh hour , when a slight but significant change in someone 's collision course ( the US of course hopes it will be Russia 's ) will enable the international organization to slip safely into calmer water as well as into 1965 . Meantime , the atmosphere inside the green glass skyscraper on the East River is charged with plots and subplots , rumors , threats and blandishments , all as prelude to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postponed ) and the dreaded debate on the debts . The crisis has been long anticipated . But until this month , few people took seriously American warnings that , should the Russians fail to pay up , the US would try to invoke Article 19 of the Charter to deprive the Soviets and most of their satellites of their votes in the Assembly . American officials have all along been optimistically predicting that the Soviets will finally give in . Under the UN rules , the Soviet Union can evade the penalty of lost voting rights by paying a mere $5.8 million . Though Russia 's assessed debt is $52.6 million , a member can be two years in arrears without penalty . The 1962-63 assessment figure for Russia is $46.8 million ; by paying the difference between this and the October , 1964 , total of $52.6 million , the Soviet Union could stay within the rules . Most UN diplomats seem convinced , even now , that there is a great element of bluff in the US stand . After all , there is a basic contradiction between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Johnson spoke during the election campaign , and a policy of apparently pushing the Soviets to the wall . And yet , having gone to such lengths to affirm repeatedly that nothing will satisfy Washington but Soviet payment of its share of peacekeeping costs , or the application of Article 19 , perhaps the US has painted itself into a corner . The Soviet stand is that the peacekeeping operations in the Middle East were not approved by the Security Council , only by the Assembly , and that those in the Congo were initially approved by the Council but later ( under the direction of the Secretary-General , the late Dag Hammarskjold ) took a form and direction neither anticipated nor agreed to by the Russians . On July 20 , 1962 , the International Court at The Hague ruled against Russia by calling both peacekeeping forces part of regular UN operations . Soviet and American spokesmen have made hundreds of speeches and declarations to prove the respective rightness of their cause . These , however , have very little effect on most delegates ; what matters to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one should fear more . What , after all , is the UN to many new ( and poor ) nations ? It is , first of all , the only platform from which they may remind the world From time to time that they exist . It is also in some cases the only source of economic and technical aid . Finally , the UN may turn out to be their only protector if they are attacked . These small countries now find themselves between the hammer and the anvil . If they do not go along with Ambassador Stevenson , the US may withhold its contribution to the UN 's technical assistance program ; without that contribution of $57.8 million ( 4o percent of the total ) the whole UN-aid scheme would collapse . On the other hand , the Russians threaten to walk out of the UN if a majority votes to suspend their rights , and if Russia walked out it would mean the ruin of the world body . In such circumstances , it is not surprising that a number of committees have been formed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find a compromise . There is still considerable opinion in the UN that if no compromise is reached , the Soviet threat to leave is more serious than the American threat to cut financial support . Many of these smaller countries , therefore , will not support a resolution to deprive the Soviets of their voting right . True , Ambassador Stevenson and his aides claim that the Americans have a majority ; they even show " confidential figures " to support their point . But the claim is widely disbelieved . The American position is further weakened by the fact that what seems to be an American-Soviet contest is in fact a three-corner fight , the third antagonist being France . The French are keeping very quiet , but they side with the Russians , though de Gaulle 's motives in refusing to pay his share of the UN 's Congo operation are different from those of the Soviets . For the USSR , the Congo operation was merely a UN cover for US policy . For de Gaulle , it was inadmissible that the UN should intervene in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed that there was any danger of a Communist takeover in the Congo ; i.e. , it was geography rather than a UN force which prevented direct Soviet intervention . For de Gaulle , moreover , the Congo precedent is highly dangerous . Encouraged by it , the UN ? composed , as de Gaulle sees it , mostly of irresponsible countries who vote frivolously ? might tomorrow order a " peacekeeping " operation somewhere for which they will not pay and to which they will not send their own troops . Last but not least , de Gaulle 's refusal to pay up must be seen as another pressure play to convince Washington that if it does not accept France as an absolutely equal partner , it will find her a troublesome opponent . For the past few years , the impact of the United Nations on world affairs has been steadily diminishing . The main reason is , of course , the egotism of big and small countries alike . None is yet prepared to surrender even a part of its national sovereignty to an international body . World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or before December 31 ; but the long-awaited Kennedy Round of world-trade talks will not , it seems , get seriously underway before January , and then may continue right through next year and into 1966 ( President Johnson 's authority to make tariff cuts , under the 1962 Trade Expansion Act , expires in October , 1967 ) . What this means is that by some date in 1966 , 14 countries in Europe including Britain and Czechoslovakia , and the United States , Canada and Japan , may have reached agreement to make a start with reducing industrial tariffs , by stages and eventually by as much perhaps as 3o percent . This prospect seems an " uneffectual fire " compared with the bright dawn the late President Kennedy thought he saw , when he confidently talked of trade negotiations to cut most tariffs in half , and abolish tariffs altogether on those industrial goods that are mostly manufactured by the United States , Britain and the six countries which constitute the European Common Market . It took 18 months of haggling over ground rules to get to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the items on which they did not want across-the-board tariff cuts , thus at last clearing the way for bargaining about the trade categories on which across-the-board cuts are at any rate discussable . And there have been other formidable obstacles in the way of the negotiations . Germany 's politically powerful , high-cost wheat farmers by resisting any reduction of grain prices almost provoked a French walkout . Just when this situation seemed at least to have eased last week , the Italians complained that even the lower grain prices approved by the Commission of the European Economic Community would raise Italy 's cost of living to an intolerably high level , through increased beef and milk prices . And the atmosphere has also been disturbed by American beef quotas , an American tax on capital exports and doubling American tariffs on glass and carpets , and by an emergency 15-percent surcharge imposed by the new British Labour government on practically all British imports . Under the circumstances , one should perhaps be thankful that there still seems a reasonable prospect of any kind of trade talks at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiated , it is probably fair to say that the high hopes of 1962 were almost certainly exaggerated . Nor need this incur charges of hindsight : Mr. Oscar Gass said so quite plainly at the time , in two articles in The New Republic in March , 1962 . Even if Britain had got into the Common Market ? and the larger aspirations of the Trade Expansion Act were more or less pinned to that ? Mr. Gass took leave to doubt that reducing or even removing tariffs that average ( in the US case ) only 11 percent would solve either the US problems of slow growth and stubborn unemployment , or the still more intractable difficulties confronting the underdeveloped countries of the world . The 122 nations attending the United Nations trade conference in Geneva in the spring of this year made it painfully plain then that they regard the Kennedy Round as an overrated operation that is being conducted within the basic framework of a " club " of rich NOVEMBER 28 , 1964 ( and almost entirely white ) countries , and which is highly unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems . This view has some justification . Food , industrial raw materials and fuels make up go percent of the value of the less-developed nations ' exports ; petroleum accounts for 12 percent of US imports and , even so , the US has excepted it from the Kennedy Round of tariff-cutting negotiations . The underdeveloped countries ' share of world trade has shrunk from 3o to zo percent in a decade . Their attempts to wriggle out of their growing difficulties by borrowing have simply landed them with a disastrous mass of short-term debts . The Secretary of State says that a failure of the Kennedy Round will be a breach of faith with the less-developed countries , but how in fact will those countries be assisted by the industrialized nations taking in more of one another 's washing ? The Kennedy Round may conceivably end by making the rich a little richer , but that will only make the poor countries relatively still poorer , unless the industrialized nations quickly reach agreement to open their doors to what the poor have to sell , on preferential terms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledgement of the debt owed to Southern Negroes by the Democratic Party and by most Americans . The Goldwater strategy of carrying the whole South would have succeeded , in spite of considerable white-minority support for President Johnson in the states he carried and in some he did n't , but for the substantial Negro vote . In all parts of the South the Negro vote went Democratic by better than 95 percent but , in the 11 states of the old Confederacy , only in his own state of Texas did Johnson have a clear majority of white votes . Goldwater carried Mississippi , Alabama , Louisiana , South Carolina and Georgia in the South , but a majority of the whites in five other states also voted for him . The six Southern states that Johnson carried are the only states in the South where more than 45 percent of Negroes eligible to vote are registered . In most Southern states , Negroes who had long played parts in the Republican Party 's state organizations were ejected from those roles before the Republican Party convention . In the Goldwater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party of Lincoln were to be more than replaced by great Republican gains among Southern white voters . Democratic politicians , who for decades had led the South 's resistance to civil rights including Negro voting , defected to the Republicans . Others sat the campaign out , including Senator Richard Russell and Senator Herman Talmadge of Georgia . Georgia 's moderate Governor Carl Sanders was left to lay his political life on the line for Johnson . The votes were counted and Sanders came up short ; and the White House has since shown more interest in rapprochement with the two Senators than in rewarding the loyal Governor . The invitation to Georgia politicians to President Johnson 's deer-hunt at his Texas ranch was phoned not to Sanders , but to Russell . Once , Sanders was regarded as a likely man to beat Russell in 1966 . The immediate moral for Southern politicians seems to be that if you ca n't win for the party , do n't try . Solidly Democratic Negro votes saved Democratic Congressmen . The only notable Republican gains in the South below the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Senator Albert Gore of Tennessee defeated his Republican opponent by 73,500 votes ; the Negro vote was 153,500 . In the second district of Louisiana , Democratic Representative Hale Boggs won by 17,900 votes ; the Negro vote was at least 25,000 . There were a number of such cases . The Negro vote explains the retention of the few Southern Congressmen who survived the election after voting for the civil rights bill . Representative Ross Bass won a Senate seat in Tennessee by 52,300 votes ; the Negro vote was 157 , goo . Representative Charles Weltner of Atlanta was reelected by 12,300 votes ; the Negro vote was 32,100 . The Republican white onslaught was not without its ironies , for in Alabama it destroyed half a century of conservative Democratic seniority by the defeat of Representative George Huddleston Jr . of Birmingham and two other Congressmen ; and in Mississippi it removed in the name of Goldwater conservatism as conservative . a voice as there was in the US House , the voice of Democrat W. Arthur Winstead . The five Southern states that Goldwater carried have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old Confederacy . His margins were highest where Negro registrations are lowest ; as , for example , in Mississippi ( 28,500 out of 422,50o Negroes were eligible ) where Goldwater had his biggest margin , 306,000 . Without the increases in Negro voter registration in the past two years that the Voter Education Project has produced , Goldwater would have carried Florida and Virginia . The Voter Education Project coordinated registration activities of the five major civil rights organizations and local groups . It ends this year , but registration will remain an important object of the Southern Negro movement .
