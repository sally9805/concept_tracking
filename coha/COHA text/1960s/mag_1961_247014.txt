Either we must have a war against Russia before she has the atom , and win it , or lie down and say , " Come and govern us . " <P> - Bertrand Russell , Nov. 20 , 1948 <P> Shortly after Russia did get " the atom , " by exploding its first bomb in 1949 , the great philosopher began pleading with the West to lie down before world Communism . One day last week , Lord Russell , 89 , walked into London 's Bow Street Magistrates ' Court accompanied by Lady Russell , 61 , and three dozen fellow members of Britain 's ban-the-bomb movement , which advocates unilateral Western dis armament . Together , they stood charged* of planning a giant sitdown demonstration in Parliament Square , of " inciting members of the public " to attend even after the Ministry of Works declined permission for the rally , and of being " likely to persist in such unlawful conduct . " Asked the court clerk : " Are any of you willing to be bound over to be of good behavior and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " No ! " <P> Having prudently brought along an overnight bag , Russell obviously hoped to go to jail ( " If you condemn us , " said he , " you 'll be helping our cause " ) , and Magistrate Bertram Reece obliged . Amid gallery cries of " Fascist ! " and " Shame ! " , he imposed a two-month sentence , later reduced to one week for health reasons . Then the frail old man was whisked un ceremoniously away ( unknown hands had written three hasty words in the dust on his Black Maria : " Ban the bomb " ) to Brixton jail . It was a homecoming : Russell had spent six months of World War I there for his pacifist views . <P> Confined to the prison hospital on a liquid diet prescribed by his physician , Russell issued a gloomy statement : " I am to be silenced for a time , perhaps forever , for who can tell how soon the great massacre will take place ? " Fellow Prisoner Arnold Wesker , one of Britain 's more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Barley ) , was less pessimistic . Sentenced to one month , Wesker asked for and received pencils , paper and a partly finished manuscript . His request for a typewriter and secretary as well was turned down . <P> The jailing of Bertrand Russell , together with Anglican Missionary Michael Scott , a leading spokesman for Negro rights , only gave further momentum to the giant sitdown demonstration still scheduled for the weekend . Despite the underlying grimness , the whole affair took on a sort of gaiety . Among the latest eager ban-the-bombers were Angry Young Man John Osborne ( " I shall be happy to go to gaol for six months " ) , Actresses Wendy Hiller and Vanessa Redgrave , Playwright Shelagh Delaney ( Taste of Honey ) , Jazz Singer George Melly , Poet <P> Sir Herbert Read . As the list of celebrities grew to cocktail-party proportions , the Spectator observed wryly that " to spend a month in prison in the company of Reverend Michael Scott-and soon perhaps of Mr. John Osborne and Miss Shelagh Delaney-would make many of the campaign 's humbler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under the seldom used Justices of the Peace Act of 1361 , passed at the end of the long war with France to keep armed men wandering about England from committing violence .
