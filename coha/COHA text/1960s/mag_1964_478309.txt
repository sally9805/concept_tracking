1964 will tell whether labor 's political power , as an adjunct to the Democratic party , is live lion or paper tiger . Various polls , during the summer , indicated heavy Goldwater sentiment among Steelworkers in Pittsburgh , Gary , Youngstown. and Chicago . An Auto Workers local in McKeesport , Pennsylvania , which in 1960 had gone 78 per cent for Kennedy was found to be only 60 per cent for Johnson . From other industrial centers came similar tidings of Democratic defections arising in the main from the " white backlash . " Yet most labor leaders are now convinced that their constituents will turn out in comparatively larger numbers than ever before and that 70 per cent of them will cast their ballots for Johnson , thus providing him with the decisive margin of victory . This would be the most impressive performance in years . Stevenson got only an estimated 55 per cent of their vote in 1956 , Kennedy only 63 per cent in ' 60 . The prevailing optimism is due , in part , to a different and largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top echelon of the union world to the Goldwater candidacy . Frightened and aroused as never before , they are supporting Johnson with a unanimity that pervades all 130 national unions affiliated with the AFL-CIO , representing 13.5 million members . Goldwater has been forsaken even by such devout Republicans as Maurice Hutcheson , head of the Carpenters , James Suffridge , chief of the Retail Clerks , and Lee W. Minton , president of the Glass Blowers , Moreover , the majority of the 1.5 million " independent " Teamsters regard Goldwater with something of the same affection that James R. Hoffa displays toward former Attorney General Robert Kennedy . Even the conservative craft unionists in the Plumbers , Printers , Pattern Makers , and others see this fall 's election as a stark confrontation 44 THE RIDDLE OF THE LABOR VOTE between the labor movement and right-wing extremism . At the grass roots it will be preeminently a test of strength between COPE Committee on Political Education ) , which serves as the political arm of the AFL-CIO --  -- and Goldwater 's shock troops , recruited from the John Birch Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Texans for America , the Minutemen , the National Right to Work Committee with its allies in the Business and Industry Political Committee ( sponsored by the NAM ) , and the Medical Political Action Committee ( sponsored by the AMA ) . No labor leader needs to be told that these groups are the enemy . He has been scarred by duels with their lobbyists and propagandists , who oppose every cause unions cherish . But now , for the first time , the resources of these visceral foes of labor are openly pooled in a Presidential contest . In sheer numbers , the labor people will not be outdone . COPE is counterattacking with 500,000 election workers . Each one is supposed to get twenty voters to the polls . And if the simple arithmetic of the labor vote were all that mattered , neither the unions nor the Democrats would have much to worry them . About three-quarters of the country 's union members are concentrated in sixteen states , * which , together , command 293 electoral votes ( 23 more than are needed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an average 19 per cent of the voting-age population , and it is the task of the COPE volunteers to make sure that they register and vote . But this can be a useful exercise ? from labor 's point of view ? only if there is some certainty that the dues-payers will pull the Democratic lever . Since this can hardly he taker for granted , COPE has been mounting an ideological campaign unprecedented in sweep and verve . It is specifically designed to offset the Goldwater magnetism . I observed this struggle fur men 's minds as it is being waged in a section of Connecticut within the jurisdiction of the Greater New Haven Labor Council , AFL-CIO . Represented here are one hundred different unions whose forty thousand members work in " In New York State , for example , there arc 2.1 million trade unionists ; 1.5 million in Pennsylvania ; and 1.3 million each in California and Illinois ; 1.1 million each in Ohio and Michigan ; 700,000 in New Jersey ; 565,000 in Indiana ; 550,000 in Massachusetts ; 510,000 in Missouri ; 420,000 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and roughly 200,000 each in West Virginia , Oregon , and Connecticut.such diverse fields as aerospace , apparel manufacture , brewing , construction , rail and highway transport , insurance , retail trade , police protection , and fire fighting . One out of three jobs in the area depends on military contracts ? a situation which highlights the extent to which the effects of defense spending permeate the entire economy . The Council 's racial and religious spectrum includes Yankee Unitarians , Polish Catholics . and Negro Methodists along with many others . Connecticut has , of course , an indigenous New England atmosphere that sets it apart from the rest of the country . Political observers , however , generally agree that such regional differences , except perhaps in the South , are of diminishing importance , particularly in a Presidential election . " I 'm for Goldwater Because . . . " President of the New Haven Council is Vincent J. Sirabella ? an unusually reliable barometer of labor sentiment . Part Italian , part Irish , at forty-two he has the build of a Green Bay Packer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piety . He is a man of torrential energy , a devoted and intellectual Catholic who combines his reading in modern theology with an insatiable appetite for books and articles on public affairs to compensate for a formal education that ended at the age of thirteen . A one-time dishwasher , busboy , waiter , bartender , and business agent for the Hotel and Restaurant Workers , he has never lost touch with the rank and file . Over the years he has effectively translated their needs and desires into programs of economic and political action . Believing ? as did our must perceptive World War II jump generals and tank commanders ? that the place for the leader is at the head of his troops , he has joined every picket line in the New Haven area for the past five years . At election time he leaves headquarters to go out and punch doorbells . Before November third he will have made some eight hundred house-to-house calls . In the course of his rounds to date he has encountered plenty of ardent emotional Goldwater adherents . Nonetheless as early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the labor vote in New Haven will go to Johnson . He adds that , " In the great payoff states of the Middle Atlantic , the Midwest , and the West Coast , the labor movement will do far better for the Democratic party than ever before . " Neither Mr. Sirabella nor the other sanguine labor prophets minimize the visible and invisible roadblocks ahead . They are formidable indeed . But so too are the forensic weapons union strategists have forged . I saw them put to use in the course of weeks spent in and around New Haven talking to union men and women in meeting hall , in bar and grill , and in their homes . Few of Goldwater 's union supporters parade their anti-Negro bias when you start questioning them . But as they warm up , it becomes the pervasive theme . A railroad trainman , for example , who described himself as a Democrat for Goldwater began by complaining of the money wasted on foreign aid and bureaucracy ; he praised Gold-water 's " forthrightness and honesty " and charged Johnson with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thirty years and never saw poverty until the other day . I disagree with Goldwater on Social Security but I do n't think he can change that . It 's the law . he 'd be too sensible to try . " Then he reached the heart of the matter . " Goldwater knows the Administration is going about civil tights the wrong way . " A sheet-metal worker got to the point more swiftly and more explicitly . " Goldwater. now he 's got the guts , he tells you plain what the average politician won't. " he said . " He tells the truth about Cuba and Vietnam . Our boys are being killed there . The white man 's rights ought to be protected , too . There ought to be new stipulations about it in the big print and the fine print . I got a two-family house . If I ca n't choose the tenant , if a Negro wants it , and I do n't want him , they can force me , demonstrate in front , You ca n't cram it down people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he continued , " and want to hire , I ought to do it on qualifications , not because a man 's colored . The Negro who can hold down a job , he knows that . It 's the ones with weak minds and strong backs that this CORE and others of them appeal to . Look at the crime , thieves , muggers , winos , shiftless unmarrieds , and punks with chips on the shoulder . Look at how they f . . all day , on my tax money and yours ? we work . Why do n't the colored get off relief now and do something for themselves instead of blaming everybody ? Yes sir , this will be my first Republican vote and I 've been voting since 1936 . " A cafe waiter was equally candid . " I 'm for Goldwater because he 's for segregation , " he said . " That 's why I like him . I know about Social Security and his bad union record . But Negroes are getting too aggressive , trying to push in everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The head of a local government-workers union told me he personally deplored this kind of racism and would stick with the Democrats himself . But he wound up with his own apologia for the renegades to Goldwater . " The national , state , and municipal administrations have been bending over backwards on the side of the Negro , " he said . " Whites resent it . And everybody resents the billions , the five or seven billions , I do n't know just how much , we 're pouring into foreign aid instead of doing more for our own people . I hear complaints about that all the time . What attracts the younger generation to Goldwater is the recklessness , you might call it the daring , of youth . And , they 're angry over the tearing up of American flags in West Africa . I 'm with them there . Lots of us are sick and tired of having America sticking second tit all over the world . " What Started This Rumor ? Many of the less skilled and informed workers genuinely fear that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to " work for half the pay " and thus take the white man 's job and lower wage standards . This worry is fed by a rumor which has spread across the country that the civil-rights act will compel the white worker to step aside while the employer fills " job quotas " for the Negro . Nobody knows just where or when this idea got started . It is attributed variously to statements by Senator Lister Hill , during the debate over the civil-rights bill , to the " preferential-hiring " doctrine advocated by some Negro spokesmen , and to a whispering campaign fostered by agents provocateurs from the Goldwater camp . Last August the rumor reached such proportions that COPE urged shop stewards and other local union officials to keep explaining that the worker 's seniority is fully protected by collective-bargaining provisions which , under a Goldwater Administration , would be vitiated , even expunged . And the AFL-CIO has developed a new educational program to separate facts about the civil-rights act from fantasy and to encourage every union to combat discriminatory practices in its own ranks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be called a diversionary tactic to deal with the white-backlash problem . He is selective about it , however , for he believes it is a waste of time to bother with the irreducible hard core of Goldwater supporters . He describes them as " impervious to argument as religious fanatics " and as " sick with insecurity and spite . " In his view COPE should not anywhere aspire to " nineteen out of twenty labor votes for the Democratic party , but make sure of six out of ten , and go for broke for seven . " He is therefore concentrating on those who merely lean toward Goldwater . To convert them , he uses an approach along these lines : " If the choice is whether your kid has to go to school with a Negro child , or if you have to have a Negro as a neighbor , or whether you will he eliminated by nuclear war , what will you choose ? You know that Goldwater wants to give the decision to use nuclear weapons to commanders in the field who in Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as American . This is literally a life-ordeath decision , Do n't you think it ought to be left up to the President of the United States , or do you want to run the Goldwater kind of risk ? not just for yourself but for your wife and your children ? " Mr. Sirabella and his aides are coaching election campaigners in this strategy . It seems to be effective . A rubber worker , for instance , told me , " At the lunch break , when we get talking about the election , the thing that keeps coming up most often is that Goldwater is the most likely to get us into war . Not necessarily a nuclear war , but any kind of shooting war . Nobody wants the American people to be shoved around , and we 've got to have a big stick , but keep our nerve , too , like Johnson does . But we do n't want war , period . " A machinist agreed . " When Goldwater said he wants the generals in the field to signal when to drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " I do n't care how much he tries to explain it from now on . Just listen to the women talking at the supermarket ? they know that Johnson is a cool operator who can keep the peace . That 's going to be more important than this backlash . " Such confidence might be more fully justified if the white-backlash vote were only what it appears to he on the surface . Labor leaders sense , however , that Senator Goldwater is exploiting a psychological substratum of protest , which often is not directed at Negro intransigence per se . It is a convenient whipping boy for what is. in effect , a new mass revolt against the stale tensions of work without challenge , the emptiness of escapist distractions , the lack of place and purpose in a society whose complications breed anxiety that seems beyond the individual 's comprehension and control . Senator Goldwater becomes a magnet for all the free-floating discontents of a new middle class , which is union-made economically , but which is without the occupational prestige , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the century 's turn to the onset of World War II , gave to the old middle class its prideful and definitive role in the community . " Goldwater knows a lot of people are mad but they do n't know why , " said a tool-and-die maker . " He 's the mad man 's candidate , how about that ? " Back to Bread and Butter No more equipped to deal with such imponderables than anyone else , labor leaders have reverted to something they well know how to handle , the bread-and-butter interests of their following . It is relatively simple to portray Goldwater as the mortal enemy of the labor movement and of the living standards it has won for itself and for others . He is , after all , on record as favoring those right-to-work laws which impair a union 's ability not only to organize , but to stabilize and discipline its membership after it has been signed up . It can be argued that , in his effort to uproot industry-wide collective bargaining , he is seeking to repeal that section of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a human being is not a commodity , " and thus to equate labor with the inanimate articles which in interstate commerce come under the Sherman Antitrust Act . The vision of Senator Goldwater as a " union-busting " forerunner of the authoritarian state seems to be taking hold . This was the ease with several people I questioned , including a woman garment worker , a male brewery worker , a teamster , an electrician , and an insurance worker , none of whom are especially fond of Negroes , and one of whom " would like to ship them to Africa . " All , however , expressed alarm that the Senator ? in the words of AFL-CIO President George Meany ? " thinks that the country would be better off without a trade-union movement " altogether . This is also the view of a steelworker who has studied at night to become a laboratory technician . " I 've been in the labor movement thirty-two years , " he said , " and this is the worst candidate the Republicans have ever put up . He is opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wants to eliminate all these advances . " To hammer home this message , COPE publications and the labor press continuously feature the Goldwater box score in the Senate , which shows him " wrong " in fifty-three key roll-call votes , when he opposed ? among other proposals ? a rise in minimum wage , tax reduction for lower-income groups , and the extension of federal aid to the handicapped and the elderly , and to education . COPE emissaries break these items down into simple colloquial specifics . In face-to-face contact , from San Diego aircraft plant to Bangor sawmill , they ask , " Would you vote for a man who says $1.25 an hour is too much for you to earn " and " who has refused to let people like us have another hundred dollars a year in tax relief while allowing big businessmen to deduct fancy ' entertainment ' expenses on their tax return " and " who wouldn't. let the poor blind and crippled have another four bucks a month " and " who would n't let people over sixty-five who depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day for food , rent , clothing , and medicine " and " who does n't want the government to spend another five dollars a year on your kid to get him decent classrooms and good teachers ? " And the jackpot question is : " Would you vote for a guy who would take your union away from you and let management push you around in the old ' take it or leave it ' way ? " The impact of this technique is slightly weakby ened by a certain ambiguity in the President 's past performance . As one shop steward put it : " It 's hard to be all out for Johnson . He has a lousy labor record . " This statement is not without foundation . But in labor 's book the Presidential and the Congressional Johnson are very different phenomena . Labor leaders by and large are willing to forget , for instance , that the latter voted in 1947 to override President Truman 's veto of the Taft-Hartley Act or that in 1959 , as Senate Majority Leader , he had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stringent provisions of the Landrum-Griffin Act to regulate internal union affairs . ( In a recent biography of the President , Mr. William S. White ascribes to him a vote in favor of Labor 's Magna Carta , the Wagner Act , which would have been difficult since the law was passed in 1935 and Mr Johnson did not get to Congress until 1937 . ) It was the memory of Johnson 's record on labor legislation that caused dismay among union leaders when Kennedy chose him as his running mate in 1960 . But 1964 is something else again , and not only because labor leaders feel that they were of some assistance to Mr. Johnson in making up his mind about Hubert Humphrey . Lesson of the Stacked Deck Soon after taking over the Presidency , Mr. Johnson began mending labor fences with high diligence and skill . He knows that he needs the labor vote as the vital mass base in the Democratic party coalition . And the labor movement knows it needs him for self-preservation , if nothing more . Evidence of this new mutuality is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent Democratic Convention were labor leaders . As pragmatists they admire the President 's mastery of the political art , and as activists they find him temperamentally congenial and inspiring . They trust him to furnish , quid pro quo , not a whole loaf in terms of their aspirations but some thick slices , buttered . They are sure that he will redeem his party 's platform pledge to repeal the Taft-Hartley Act 's Section 14-B which , for seventeen years , has been undermining union security and growth . They also believe that he will help them push toward a minimum wage of two dollars an hour and a shorter work week of thirty-five hours . Above all , they are persuaded that the Johnson Administration wants to move toward a full-employment economy . This is proving a cogent campaign theme . 48 THE RIDDLE OF THE LABOR VOTE For ? apart from his fear of Negro competition and despite the boom ? the American worker is worried , even obsessed , about automation and defense cutbacks . He knows these have not brought the dread consequences often prophesied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has been displaced by electronic ganglia or cancellation of military contracts . No statistics , no Dow Jones averages , no debates over whether unemployment is more " structural " than " frictional " can persuade him that he may not he next . COPE is making much of Administration steps toward more employment opportunity , such as the antipoverty act , as portents of still more to come . COPE is also seeking to crystallize and transform into votes a widening belief that in case of economic decline or disaster , President Johnson and the Democratic party can be relied on to do something positive and remedial , whereas Senator Goldwater and his version of the Republican party would merely lecture the jobless on their lack of gumption in being thrown out of work . " We know Goldwater very well , " a UAW lathe operator said . " We know he is out to get us . Bury us . We know he 's the kind of guy who 'd give you an extra buck , like a handout to make him feel good , but would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you work for it . earn , and are entitled . Everybody in the plant knows that if a Tdefense contract has to be canceled. the Democrats will phase it out . They 'd try to be human about it . But the Republicans like Goldwater , not Rockefeller , will just think about their golf score . " The image of a cold and heartless Goldwater took shape in the minds of many union men and women who watched on TV the right-wing coup in San Francisco . " That convention was a stacked deck . " a Steelworkers official said . " He denied others freedom , ordinary courtesy . Underneath that easy manner , and just-folks thing , there was something mean . cruel . It showed I could n't trust him to handle power . As the issues get analyzed , pinpointed , itemized , Goldwater will make fewer inroads into the labor vote . It will drop away from him . " An Army to the Suburbs abor leaders look upon the 1964 election as a test of their missionary effectiveness in particular and of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to invigorate COPE in recent years are uneasy over the failure of thelabor movement , as a whole , to indoctrinate the rank and file with the rudiments of political economy and thus show the connection between ballot box and breadbox . Others wonder if this year they may not pay a penalty for their reluctance to act more vigorously on the premise that , for the labor movement , political power has become less the surrogate than the precondition for economic power ; that what happens in legislative hall , executive mansion , and judicial chamber not only shapes the environment in which collective bargaining is conducted but also determines to an increasing extent whether there will be anybody or anything to bargain about . Labor leaders are well aware that there is no deliverable labor vote , as a bloc , but only a profile of political dispositions ; that it is not just the union member but the whole man who goes to the polls . His political choices are determined not only by his affiliation with the union but also by his religion and ethnic origin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ties and traditions of his family and its status strivings . Senator Goldwater ? according to his biographer Jack Bell ? " ? thinks that COPE is the best political organization he has ever seen . But it has never been able to express the self-interest of its constituents with the passion and precision of the world 's most influential " trade union , " the American Medical Association . Moreover , not a few workers still believe that voting , like lovemaking , is a distinctly private transaction , and that the union should restrict itself to wages , hours , work conditions . Others think it is appropriate for the union to inform members about the voting records of various candidates , but without advocacy , and to encourage everybody to go to the polls , but as Americans , not just as trade unionists . With the help of the Teamsters and other independents at the local level , COPE hopes to turn out possibly 80 per cent of the potential labor vote , and further forecasts that the 20 per cent of this vote which has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such expectations are based not only on Goldwater 's " vulnerable " labor position , but also on the meticulous canvassing that COPE has been doing . It was among the first to grasp the political meaning of shifts away from the central city to fringe suburbs , whose population rose 48.6 per cent during the 1950-60 decade and perhaps another 4 per cent since . COPE discovered , as its able research director , Mary Godard Zon , points Mr. Conservative . Doubleday , 1962 . It was recently reissued. out , that from the early to the late 1950s , when union families were moving from metropolis to an established suburb , they were scattered , hard to reach , and would often try to " fit in , " or belong , by acquiring the political coloration of their new neighbors . More recently , however , large-scale housing developments near Detroit , St. Louis , Baltimore , San Francisco , and other industrial centers have been creating new suburbs of their own . They are virtually self-contained , from church to shopping center . They are occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are therefore not exposed to social pressures and views any different from those they have left behind . This new suburban labor vote is one of COPE 's prime targets . Furthermore , instead of concentrating only on union lists , its canvassers this year will cover nonunion people of lower and medium income block by block , as part of the most massive register and get-out-the-vote drive in union annals . COPE is spending about $4 million in this effort and in contributions to the campaigns of various state and federal candidates . What the budget of the Goldwater foot soldiers will be is unknown . ( COPE contends that in 1963 the major right-wing alignments now supporting Goldwater were spending $25 million a year on political and related activities . ) But they are numerous , palpitant , and ? as Rockefeller forces learned in California ? grim and determined . In the past five Presidential elections the labor vote has repeatedly upset forecasts , whether based on economic determinism , the psychology of the underdog , precinct profiles , the counsels of labor leaders , the insights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these combined . But this year the riddle of the labor vote is losing much of its enigmatic character as COPE continues to stitch together for the worker 's enlightenment the hazards of nuclear incineration ; the loss of influence over the sale of his labor ; a dwindling job market ; an uncaring government . In identifying these and other perils with the Goldwater candidacy , the labor movement is waging a scare campaign which is giving it a cohesiveness and thrust beyond anything in its history and which may well last beyond November third . A major paradox of the Goldwater counterrevolution is that the Senator is providing the labor movement with just the kind of adversary it has long required for political clarity and consensus . " On this one , " says a packinghouse worker , most of us feel it will make a difference who gets in . " The prospects , therefore , are that the labor vote for Johnson and Humphrey can even exceed , in terms both relative and absolute , that cast in 1936 to help attain for the Roosevelt-Garner ticket its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
