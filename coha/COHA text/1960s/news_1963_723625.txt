txt Letters to , The Times Insuring Exchange Firms Solvency Protection for Clients of Stock Exchange Houses Asked TO THR EDITOR OF THR NEW YORK TIMES : Your editorials regarding protection of clients of stock exchange firms are entirely justified , and I believe actions toward this goal are necessary . The result of the insolvency of Ira Haupt and the enforced liquidation of Williston &; Beane must be followed by measures that insure clients against loss due to inability of an exchange member house to discharge its financial obligations . The record on this score is excellent . From Richard Whitney to DuPont , Homsey , no bankruptcy has occurred on the New York Stock Exchange . The voluntary restitution in the case of DuPont , Homsey and the rescue of Williston &; Beane are no assurance that another Haupt-type debacle could not occur , nor in fact that many could not occur . The Securities and Exchange Commission has pointed to the necessity for corrective measures on abuses of various descriptions . This was a valuable and important study , and to some degree an indictment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different subject . Some firms will be careless , greedy , stupid or fraudulent . There can be no certain safeguard for protection . But there can be rulings tantamount in their protective quality to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for banks and savings loan associations . The new administration of the American Exchange brought a cleansing to that organization , But that has to do with ethics . Probably the New York Stock Exchange has done some cleansing too since the S.E.C. reports . But the mitigation ( far cry from elimination ) of derelictions is not a guarantee of solvency . A betterment of the ratio of net worth to debt might help , but it would not insure clients against insolvencies . The country is prospering . Now is the time , with the Haupt debacle so fresh and alarming , for a real solvency insurance law for exchange members . EUGENE MESSNER . New York , Dec. 9 , 1963 . Resisting Quill 's Demands To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TI NI Es : Your editorial of Dec. 4 " BreakEven Fare " has much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subway rider , voice one very small doubt as to the effectiveness of a 25-cent fare ( or a 30-cent , or a 50-cent fare ) in securing for the hapless passengers of our mismanaged subway system something approaching adequate service in the interest of the public ? Is there even the slightest hope that our city government and our Transit Authority will resist in the future the outrageous demands of transit system boss Quill ? Or that our already overpaid transit system employes will hereafter pay attention to maintenance duties now being disgracefully neglected , as shown by the fact that not once , for weeks , has subway traffic operated unhindered by at least one exasperating delay on one or other of the three lines ? A. H. FROENIF . Jackson Heights , L. I. , Dec. 4 , 1963 . Douglas 's Remark Assailed To THE EDITOR OF TIlE NEW YORK TIDIES : The Times of Dec. 2 reported that Senator Paul H. Douglas , while participating in a Boston radio interview about a proposed bill making it a Federal offense to assassinate the President or the Vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in order to prevent ourselves from becoming a Latin-American republic . " Suppose that a Senator in Brazil , of equal standing in my country , were to retaliate by quoting one of the mildest commentaries by responsible United States citizens printed in your press about the fourth assassination of a United States President . An example would be the statement by the grandson of President Woodrow Wilson , Dean Francis Sayre of the Washington Cathedral : " We have been present at a new crucifixion , this one following the murder of Medgar Evers in Mississippi and the bombings resulting in the death of eight Negro children in Birmingham . " ( James Reston 's article , Nov. 25.1 In 141 years of independence Brazil has never had the assassination of a head of state or one of its people murdered because of the color of the world could ill afford to lose , it is not Christian ? not even intelligent  --  for a man of the intellectual reputation of Senator Douglas to utter an unfair remark that , to begin with , has the dubious value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin-American nations with a record similar to Brazil 's . It would be quite revealing to work up statistics by country of the Presidents of each of the North and Latin-American states who met their death at the hand of an assassin . You 'd be surprised ! JULIO N. COELHO . New York , Dec. 2 , 1963 . Succession to Presidency Appointment of New Vice President Preferred to Present System TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I have read many recent newspaper articles concerning the ? succession to the Presidency in the event the Vice **25;406;TOOLONG should die in office . The present arrangement , which has the Speaker of the House next in line , is unsatisfactory because the Speaker may not necessarily be a member of the same party and also , and more importantly , he may not possess the necessary , background and information to assume the duties of the Presidency . In effect , the present setup should mean that , when the majority party in the House of Representatives chooses the Speaker , one of the questions should be " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , obviously , should blot be one of the qualifications for being Speaker . The most logical solution to the problem would be for the Vice President , on becoming President , to appoint a man of his choosing to he the new Vice President . Or , in the event the Vice President should du in office , the President should a/p , point another Vice Presideht . I admit that at first glance this seems to be an " un-American " way of doing things , but is n't this really the way a Vice President is chosen in the first place ? After a Presidential candidate is nominated by his party , he makes known his choice for running-mate and the convention then " nominates " that person for its Vice-Presidential candidate . As voters , we have no choice as to whom we want for Vice President ? in 1960 , we could not , for instance , vote for Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Lodge . This I think is a good thing , for it helps to assure continuity of program and policy in the event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has now become an office of importance . ALBERT KUTZIN Huntington Station , L. I. , Dec. 8 , 1963 , Eternal Flame as Symbol To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES Many who have tried to give order to their thoughts and feelings in these days of poignant sorrow must feel grateful to the Rev. George A. Trowbridge for his letter in your columns of Dec. 10 . His simple suggestion , so well explained and so compassionately expressed  --  that tile " eternal flame " over President Kennedy 's grave should continue as a symbol during the official period of mourning , but thereafter be reserved , perhaps , for the Tomb of the Unknowns  --  this suggestion seems worthy of consideration at the highest level , President Kennedy 's bruised body now lies at the crown of the Arlington National Cemetery . From that beautiful and matchless site millions and millions will turn and look upon the whole capital city of the nation he loved and served , and will be conscious of his deathless spirit . This is our homage to him , a mortal man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we presume to speak also in the name , of Eternity . WHITNEY H. SIIEPARDSON . New York , Dec. 11 , 1963 . To Keep Eternal Light To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TINIES The Rev. George A. Trowbridge 's suggestion that the flame over President Kennedy 's grave be snuffed out , seems calculated to lessen the spirit of generosity and charity which his death generated , Certainly a new climate of cooperation and tolerance has been developing , of which the flame , burning over the capital , is a constant reminder . To suggest that it be made simply a trapping of mourning to be put off after a decent interval is to deny the very real agony of reappraisal so many of our citizens have endured in the face of the awful truth of John Kennedy 's death . The flame stands not only as a tribute W President Kennedy , but as a symbol of man 's striving for the right , the just , the good . To look up on the hill and find the light out would seem prophetic . VIRGINIA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1963.
