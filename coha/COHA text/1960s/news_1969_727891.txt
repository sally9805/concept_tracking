txt The Nixon Administration is embarking on a determined but politically difficult campaign to shift the Federal welfare focus from aiding the aged to caring for kids . The basic concept : Tax dollars can be better spent preventing educational and health handicaps in children  --  particularly poor children  --  than treating such disabilities later in life . " The President is deadly serious about this  --  a national commitment to the first five years of life . He wants to make this a central theme of this Administration , " declares a high-ranking White House official . As one result , the President already has ruled out reductions in programs for children in the current round of anti-inflation belt-tightening . But the broader impact is envisioned when the Vietnam war ends , permitting expansion of domestic programs . The Administration 's expressed objective is gradually to funnel a steadily larger share of ever-growing Federal revenues to youngsters , though not disregarding the needs of the aged . Higher HEW Outlays Such an approach could require a significant increase in outlays by the Department of Health , Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totals $50.5 billion even after a downward revision by the Nixon Administration . Says HEW Secretary Robert Finch : " I 'd like to see a great chunk of resources put in at the lower end of the age spectrum and hold ( spending ) at the top end . " The obstacles are substantial . Congress ' approval would be required for such a reordering of priorities , and the old folks exert immense influence there . The AFL-CIO and senior citizens ' organizations are active lobbyists for the aged . Voting clout aside , many lawmakers feel sincere concern for the plight of the typical senior citizen . Other well-established social welfare programs also have powerful constituencies who could feel short-changed by a new concentration on children ( " It implies writing off the present generation , " a planner in the poverty war complains ) . Finally , although a Federal campaign for children could have wide popular appeal , its major beneficiaries at least at the start would likely be Negro children and jobless parents . Thus , conservative forces in the Cabinet and in the Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Proposed Policies Whatever the difficulties , here are some of the youth-oriented policies the Nixon Administration will probably attempt to pursue : ? Enlargement of cash payments for needy children , either through a guaranteed annual family income , as favored by Secretary Finch , or a more conventional bolstering of existing public welfare programs . In any case , the emphasis will be on aiding poverty-stricken parents , in the hope that more Federal money will hold families together and enable adults to provide more adequately for their children . The sharpest increases would occur in the South , where welfare payments for children now are the lowest . ? Restraints on increases in Social Security payments . Many Nixon Administration officials question the need for regularly raising these retirement benefits every few years . Mr. Nixon has called for a 7% rise in Social Security outlays next year , sufficient only to cover cost-ofliving increases since February 1968 , in contrast to the 10% boost proposed by the Johnson Administration . ? Expansion of health care programs for mothers and children , in hopes of preventing costly medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high command will enthusiastically underwrite free immunization campaigns with a new German measles vaccine soon to be available , in an effort to curtail crippling birth defects from that disease . More broadly , the long-range goal would be to expand comprehensive maternal care for all povertystricken mothers . Now only about 125,000 , or less than 20% , receive such Federally financed help . ? More spending for family-planning services , particularly information about contraception , so that an impoverished mother could avoid too-frequent child-bearing and the accompanying risk of birth defects , while lightening the economic loqd on her family . In the coming year , an estimated $67 million will be spent on family-planning aid for about 1.3 million women . To reach all five million poor women of child-bearing age would cost about $90 million more annually , experts estimate . ? Enlargement of day-care programs , not only to enable mothers to work but to educate and otherwise help their young children . Present Federal services reach about 45,000 children at a cost of $27 million annually ; communities already are being encouraged to pool day-care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the service more effective and more comprehensive . ? Improvement of preschool education efforts , particularly Head Start . Recent studies find youngsters without Head Start doing as well academically as those who participated , and the experts ' conclusion is that even earlier and more sustained " intervention " in the life of the impoverished child is essential to prevent lifelong learning disabilities . Thus , preschooling will be provided , at least experimentally , to children under age three ; more followup services-will be furnished to Head Start graduates through their early grade-school years , and the search for ways to stimulate infant intelligence will be intensified . It would be misleading to suggest that a sudden shift in Federal spending from the aged to the very young is imminent . The Administration 's intent Is a gradual expansion of programs for kids while holding down increases in expenditures on the aged . However , it 's likely that the old folks will get the lion 's share of Federal social welfare expenditures for many years to come . In the fiscal year starting July 1 , Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in Social Security benefits ) on the 20 million Americans 85 and older , or $1,750 per capita . In contrast , $15 billion is earmarked for the 81.5 million Americans Under 21 , or $190 per capita ' ( for the aged , per-capita outlays for health care alone will be more than double this amount ) . The imbalance has diminished somewhat in the last decade , as the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations sought to emphasize programs for children as part of their push against poverty . But the new Administration may find it difficult to depart further from the traditional priority for the aged . One reason is that doling out more cash to old folks is automatically achieved through Social Security and Medicare benefits . " It is easier to write bigger Social Security checks for the aged ; it is much harder to deliver better educational services to children , " observes a Budget Bureau expert . Some of the Administration 's specific ideas could provoke criticism , too . Welfare experts worry about big day-care centers providing nothing more than baby-sitting , ignoring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack increasing Federal involvement in family affairs and infant training . Militant Negroes might claim that expansion of Federal birth control programs is aimed at reducing the black population . The most fundamental uncertainty of all centers on the new Administration 's willingness to expand spending on social programs . All signs now point to substantial post-Vietnam increases in Federal domestic outlays , but other demands could interfere  --  military needs for new equipment , public pressure for tax relief , state insistence on revenue-sharing . Nonetheless , the Finch forces appear firmly committed to expanding early-childhood programs . " When you Start talking about breaking the poverty cycle . . . the emphasis has to be on the child and changing his attitude and environment , and I do n't think you can start too young in that respect , " declares John Veneman , HEW - Under Secretary and a key Finch confidant .
