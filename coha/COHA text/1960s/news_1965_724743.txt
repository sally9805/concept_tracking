txt The Supreme Court declared unconstitutional today major provisions of Louisiana 's subversive activities and Communist-control law . It also held that Federal courts may enjoin state court criminal proceedings under statutes that unconstitutionally threatened to deny citizens freedom of speech . The decision overruled a previous doctrine under which Federal courts had abstained from enjoining state criminal proceedings to give the state courts an opportunity to rule upon the laws themselves . It also outflanked a Federal law of 1958 that limited the Court 's power to enjoin state proceedings . Today , the Court held . that , since the petitioners had been arrested but not yet indicted when the United States suit was brought , state " proceedings " had not commenced . The decision further held that Louisiana authorities had been using the law to harass officers of the Southern Conference Educational Fund , Inc. , who had been active in civil rights matters . It will prevent Louisiana ofIficials from trying James A. Dombrei vski , executive director lof the fund , and two other fund , officers , Benjamin E. Smith and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of a Communist front organization . Mr , Dombrowski and Mr. Smith were also charged with ' failing to b reiister as required by the state law as members of the National Lawyers Guild . In an opinion written by Jus- , Lice William J. Brennan Jr. , the Court held that the ' ' chilling effect " on freedom of expression by prosecutions under unconstitutionally vague state laws justified the intervention , of Federal courts . , The three men were arrested in October , 1963 , after their offices had been raided by police ' officers and officials of the state Un-American Affairs Committee . A state judge voided the arrest warrants for lack of probable cause , and the three brought suit for a Federal injunction before a state grand jury had had an opportunity to indict them . A three-judge District Court ' panel dismissed the suit , with one judge b dissentins " , and the three were indicted by the state grand jury . JusticeBrenna.fi 's opinion held two major sections of the law unconstitutional . Definitions Too Broad First , it said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Further , it held that Louisiana could not proceed with a criminal action against the three until a state court had given a narrow definition of the term in a civil declaratory action suit . A second section was struck down because it accepted the ' findings of the United States Attorney General and various committees as conclusive proof that the organizations were Communist-front groups , without requiring that the organizations be given a hearing and proferred other safeguards by the body that made this determination . Justice Brennan said that where prosecutions were threatened under such laws , " because ' of the sensitive nature of con , stitutionally protected expression , We have not required that all cf those subject to overbroad regulations risk prosecution to test their rights . " " For free . expression ? of transcendent value to all society , , and not merely to those exercising their rights  --  might be the loser , " he said . Federal courts may proceed under traditional equity principles in such'situations to prevent irreparable injury by nejoining the threatened prosecution , the opinion said . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrelevant , the opinion went on . since the state officials would have succeeded in harassing the men , even if they were found not guilty . Today 's decision , legal observers believe , may provide effective protection to civil rights advocates in the South who are threatened with harassment The New York Times WRITES DISSENTS : Justice William 0 . Douglas of the Supreme Court . He composed dissenting opinions in the registration cases . through so-called massive-resistance laws of the states .
