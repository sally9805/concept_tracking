Although some thought it dead , the idea of a New York afternoon newspaper is still very much alive at the Daily News . The paper has been talking it over with the unions and has shown a dummy issue to prospective advertisers . This week the directors of the Chicago Tribune-Daily News meet in Florida to ponder a decision . " The News is farther down the road toward bringing out a paper than anyone else has been , " says International Typographers Union Boss Bert Powers . <P> One reason for venturing into the afternoon field is the desire to reach a higher-income , " quality " audience that the morning tabloid misses . That would mean putting out a paper much like the one envisioned by the New York Times before it gave up the idea . As one Daily News editor puts it : " The Times 's biggest problem was that by aiming at the quality market it was cutting its own throat . " The News does not face that dilemma . <P> No Roadblocks . The News 's dummy is standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will publish five days a week and skip weekends so as not to compete with the Sunday News. * Likely contributors include Old Herald Tribune Hands Eugenia Sheppard , Dick Schaap and Judith Crist . The News hopes to avoid depleting its own staff and recruit almost entirely from the outside . So far , the Newspaper Guild has responded favorably . " We wo n't put roadblocks into the launching of the paper , " says Guild Executive Vice President Tom Murphy , who is happy to have some new jobs . <P> With a projected circulation of over 400,000 , the News feels , its paper could be printed at 20% less cost than the short-lived World Journal Tribune . The News has faster , more modern presses than the WJT and is more centrally located in Manhattan . The city 's big retailers , however , are remarkably slow to advertise in any untried medium ; many are happy enough with the morning New York Times , the afternoon Post and the surrounding suburban papers . Running , on the average , some 30 pages fatter since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ever . Despite forecasts of imminent death all these years , it has outlived all other afternoon challengers . " Why should I worry about another paper starting ? " asks Publisher Dorothy Schiff . " I 'm only worried about nuclear warfare . " <P> * Starting in February , however , New York will get a new Sunday paper , the Knickerbocker News . Put out by the publishers of Funk &; Wagnall 's Dictionary , it will contain many of the columnists , comics and features that used to appear in the World Journal Tribune but now have no New York outlet , although they are carried by out-of-town papers .
