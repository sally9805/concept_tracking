The Leo 's Roar <P> Sir : I found your article on astrology March 21 merely gently cynical . Why was it not aggressively antagonistic , as any honest investigation should have been ? Take the zodiacal list of careers . I observe that they are all professional ; is there no place for a few million Indians who are destined to careers as peasants ? <P> I wasted an hour of my time with a dictionary of art and artists . Taking 100 artists at random , I found that only nine of them were born under Gemini , which governs artists ; and that another eight were born under Libra-which governs statesmen , managers , judges . I am a Leo : leader , politician , entertainer . I happen to be a retiring , bookish scientist . I have never led anything more potent than a nature hike ; never been more political than my vote ; and even my best friends admit I am a bore .

PLEETH <P> Haifa , Israel <P> Sir : Mankind believes that the phases of the moon affect crops ; he knows that various radiations influence plant growth and that radio waves are altered by sunspots , yet he stubbornly refuses to believe that he himself can be influenced by forces outside his immediate environment . <P> Of course , no one can prove that astrology is true ; nor can it be refuted , since , like religion and philosophy , it is based largely on conjecture and metaphysics . <P> The main obstacle to looking objectively at astrology is , as usual , man 's refusal to maintain an open mind toward something that may be beyond his current comprehension . If astrology were presented to the public under the title of " Cosmic Influences on Terrestrial Activity , " it would undoubtedly be taken much more seriously . <P> RITA Ross ( Sagittarius ) <P> Somerset , N.J. <P> Sir : Shakespeare , as usual , offers the final triumphant words of common sense in unshakable terms ( though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) : <P> " This is the excellent foppery of the world , that , when we are sick in fortune , often the surfeit of our own behavior , we make guilty of our disasters the sun , the moon , and stars ; as if we were villains on necessity ; fools by heavenly compulsion ; knaves , thieves , and treachers by spherical predominance ; drunkards , liars , and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence ; and all that we are evil in , by a divine thrusting on . An admirable evasion of whoremaster man , to lay his goatish disposition to the charge of a star ! My father compounded with my mother under the Dragon 's Tail , and my nativity was under Ursa Major , so that it follows I am rough and lecherous . Tut ! I should have been that I am , had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing . " <P> E.
