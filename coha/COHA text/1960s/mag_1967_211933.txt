In New Mexico early one morning last week , Georg Schrieber , lighting designer for the Santa Fe Opera Company , heard explosions in his sleep . " I was dreaming , " he recalls , " and I remember thinking it sounded like the fireworks at the end of Hans Werner Henze 's opera The Stag King . Then I realized that could n't be right and I woke up . " Five hundred feet from the ranch house where Schrieber was staying , the company 's redwood theater was engulfed in lurid flames . At dawn , all that was left of one of America 's hand somest outdoor music facilities was a tangle of charred timbers . <P> Only hours before the blaze broke out , the company had marked the midpoint of this summer 's season with the U.S. premiere of Paul Hindemith 's first full-length opera , Cardillac ( 1926 ) . The work reflects Hindemith 's youthful expressionisms although its intricately polyphonic writing and its theme-the creator v. society-also presage such products of his maturity as the 1938 opera Mathis der Maler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E.T.A . <P> <P> Hoffmann story about an 18th century Paris goldsmith who is so obsessed with his creations that he sells them reluctantly , then reclaims them by killing his customers . Hindemith set it to a craftsmanlike score that has strong choral writing and moments of trenchant emotion ; much of the time it also justifies the quip that the hero is not Cardillac but counterpoint . <P> Rumbling Thunder . Conductor Robert Craft and Director Bodo Igesz made the most of the fact that Cardillac is swifter and more dramatic than Hin demith 's later operas . The elements cooperated too : distant thunder rumbled over the Rio Grande Valley as a vengeful Paris mob killed Cardillac , and through the wide opening at the rear of the stage , the near-capacity audience of 1,100 could see lightning flickering above the blue Jemez Mountains . Hin demith 's complex melodies were traced with clarity and polish by a well-schooled , predominantly American cast , notably Baritone John Reardon , whose demented Cardillac was powerful dramatically as well as vocally . <P> Cardillac was the 18th modern opera produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since he founded the troupe ten years ago . For a while , in the glare of last week 's fire , it also looked like the last . All of the company 's orchestral scores and most of its costumes were burned , along with the Cardillac sets . But before the ashes had cooled , Crosby was calmly laying plans to rebuild his theater and making arrangements to continue the season on a reduced scale . Two days later , the company was back in business with a. performance of Rossini 's Barber of Seville in the gymnasium of a Santa Fe high school .
