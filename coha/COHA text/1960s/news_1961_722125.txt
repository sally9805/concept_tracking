txt Advertisers are planning to boost their outlays next year , but each dollar is likely to buy a bit less than it would have purchased in 1961 . Those are the chief findings of a survey of three dozen ad directors of sizable U S. corporations Most companies now are drawing up . or have already completed , budgets for 1082 national advertising campaigns in newspapers , magazines , radio , television and other media . Of the executives interviewed , only five say their companies will spend less on ads next year than in 1961 , while 13 look for no change and 18 are budgeting increases . Their reports , on the average , indicate a spending rise of 5% to 10% next year , as compared with 1961 . But the corporate ad men , by and large , think increases in advertising rates will account for most of the boost in spending . " Just to stand still , an advertiser will have to increase his budget 5% to 7% because of added media costs , " says an official of the Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year will be about the size of the increase in our overall advertising budget , " says Max F. Barry , advertising manager of California Oil Co. of Perth Amboy , N.J. John Fellows , advertising manager of Timken Roller Bearing Co. of Canton , Ohio , says he already has received notices from 50 newspapers and magazines that ad sates will be higher in 1962 . The Reression 's Impact National advertising includes almost all advertising other than that placed directly by local businessmen . National ad spending this year is reflecting the impact of the recession ; though many ad men argue against it , corporations tend to cut ad outlays along with other costs as sales decline . National advertisers this year will spend $3.9 billion on television , radio , newspaper , magazine and outdoor advertising , down from $4 billion in 1960 , estimates Advertising Age , a trade publication . There 's no breakdown between national and local direct mail advertising , but the total outlay ie expected to inch up to $2.2 billion this year from $2.1 billion in 1960 . The only other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases play a big part in this year 's slatistics , just as they are expected to do in 1962 . Advertising rates of consumer magazines ? those of general interest  --  in August averaged 9% higher than a year earlier , according to Standard Rate &; Data Service , Inc. , a New York firm that specializes in keeping tabs on ad charges . In the same period , av- erage , ad rates of daily newspapers rose 5% , while business publications were up 4% . Television networks ' time and talent charges for the current season , which began in September , are up 3% to 5% from last season . Advertising budgets for 1962 are based to a large extent on sales prospects . They could be cut back if those prospects fail to materialize  --  or expanded if sales outrun expectations . Steel Strike Is a Threat A key element of uncertainty in the 1962 ad outlook : The possibility of a steel strike . Steel industry labor contracts expire June 30 , and a prolonged strike could cut production  --  and sales  --  in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example . It 's unlikely that such a strike would affect 1962 models , since it would begin near the end of the model year . But if any strike stretched into the fall , it could crimp output of  --  and advertising for  --  the 1963 cars . For the present , however , auto makers are among the more optimistic industries as to the 1962 sales outlook and accordingly are beefing up their ad budgets . " Our own advertising expenditures will be up appreciably on anticipation of a strong sales year and the fact that we 're introducing a wider range of models , " says Robert J. Fisher , advertising and sales promotion director of Ford Motor Co . Says the ad director of another auto company : " The more cars we sell , the more money we spend on advertising . We 're looking for a 20% increase in our ad outlays over 1961 . " Gail Smith , director , of advertising and market research for General Motors Corp. , reports , " Overall expenditures on our 1962 lines will be up over 1961 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be adversely affected by a prolonged steel strike is heavy machinery . The ad manager of a company that makes heavy construction equipment says he has submitted to top management an ad budget for only ' the first six months of 1982 . " A steel strike , " he says , " could change our plans for the last half of the year . " U.S. Steel to Hold Line But one company that would be in the center of any steel strike  --  U.S. Steel Corp. ? expects its 1962 ad outlays to equal 1961 , even if there is a walkout . " We did n't cut back our advertising during the 1959 steel strike , " says John Veckly , U.S. Steel ad director . " In the event of a strike , however , it 's very possible that there would be variations in emphasis of different products . " Less confident of the 1962 sales outlook , but still optimistic , are the makers of home appliances . Appliance sales dropped during the recession , but producers say they 've noted a pickup lately . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roy A. Lewane , advertising manager of Scovill Manufacturing 's Hamilton Beach division in Racine , Wis . " We may well revise our budget upward for the last half of 1962 if sales continue going well . " With appliance sales down , " we cut back our magazine expenditures for 1961 and the first part of , 1962 , " says the ad manager of a company that manufactures refrigerators and washing machines . " If business continues to improve , we hope to get back into a substan- tial print ( magazine ) program the last half Of 1982 . " Stiff competition is the rule in most industries , so many companies are rushing out new products and pushing into new areas in efforts to boost sales . Such moves are an important spur to ad outlays . A spokesman for Best Foods division of Corn Products Co. , for example , says his division will spend " somewhat " more on advertising next year than in 1961 , because of national introduction of its Knorr soup mixes .

" At the same time , there 's no letup in competition on our existing lines , so there 's no opportunity to cancel out dollars on the older products . " The company also Is moving some of its existing lines into new areas . It recently launched its Ritz crackers in England and introduced its Dromedary Scone Mix , developed by its British subsidiary , in the U S. market . Minnesota Mining &; Manufacturing Co looks for a " good increase " in ad spending next year to promote new products . The company expects to step up its use of daytime TV . " Daytime television is improving in programing , " says a 3-11I spokesman , " and it has a huge audience of housewives . " One of the sharpest ad budget boosts for 1982 is planned by Xerox Corp . of Rochester , N.Y . Xerox plans to spend 401 ' , more next year than it did in 1981 , chiefly because of its decision to advertise its new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company will sponsor 20 minutes of the thricemonthly , hour-long " CBS Reports , " a news documentary show .

Stretching Ad Dollars With advertising costs on the /Ise , most companies are stepping up efforts to get the most from each ad dollar These efforts involve market tests and studies , alterations in ad-buying procedures and changes In media . Wallace T. Drew , vice president and director of marketing for Cray , Inc , says his company has begun using electronic computers for correlating data on market outlets , sales , advertising media and ad rates to try to help the company 's executives determine how they can best channel ad outlays . The cosmetics maker 's advertising budget for this fall is " much higher " than a year ago , according to Mr. Drew " We anticipate our spring budget for 1962 will be much greater than last spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to determine the effectiveness of regional TV ads , as compared with newspaper advertising , according to R S. Lowell , director of advertising and sales promotion . Results of the tests will help set the company 's ad strategy for 1962 . U S. Plywood estimates its 1982 ad outlays will top 1981 by 10 ? e . In 1982 , Hagen Chemicals &; Controls , Inc. , of Pittsburgh plans to spend 25 , , more than It spent this year on research to measure the effectiveness of its ads .

Among the minority of companies planning cutbacks in 1962 ad outlays , several are affected by a provision of the defense appropriations bill passed by Congiess this year The provision sharply limits the ad outlays that defense contractors ran count as costs of the work they are doing for the Government Only ads seeking new employes and scat ce materials may he included .
