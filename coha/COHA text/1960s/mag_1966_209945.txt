All the way from Washington , Chester Nimitz had studied the statistics of disaster . None conveyed so urgently the task that faced him as the sight that met the admiral at Pearl Harbor on Christmas Day , 1941 . Where three weeks earlier the proudest flagships of the U.S. Navy had swung at anchor , only small boats plied through the oil slick , still bringing ashore the dead crewmen of a dead fleet . <P> <P> Thirty-seven years earlier , his Annapolis classbook had taken a curiously prophetic bearing on the sailor who was to lead his nation out of the greatest naval disaster in its history . " He is a man , " it had said , " of cheerful yesterdays and confident tomorrows . " So he proved to be . As new Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet , Nimitz set out first to restore the Navy 's shattered nerve-and then to restore the Navy . " I have complete confidence in you men , " he briskly assured the ashen-faced staff at Pearl Harbor . " We 've taken a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ultimate outcome . " In less than two years , U.S. shipyards enabled him to begin to fight on even terms . In the meantime , perilously outnumbered , Nimitz played a brilliant game of parry and thrust . <P> <P> Break in the Chain . Japanese strategy was to 1 ) destroy the rest of the Pacific fleet that had miraculously been on patrol when the dive bombers struck Pearl Harbor , and 2 ) build such strong defenses on its newly won island bases that no new U.S. force , no matter how strong , could possibly break through to disturb the inner empire . The island of Midway , 1.136 miles northwest of Pearl Harbor , was to be the final link in this defense chain . At the end of May 1942 , some 200 ships , the bulk of the Imperial Navy , converged for an invasion of Midway and a second surprise attack on the battered Pacific fleet . <P> <P> By then , Nimitz was ready . From a reading of the Japanese " Purple Code , " deciphered by Army cryptographers nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned at invasion point " AF . " Washington thought that " AF " was Hawaii itself . Nimitz was certain it was Midway . He bolstered the little island with every plane he could spare , ordered nearly every ship in his command to rendezvous just outside what he thought would be the farthest radius of Japanese air patrols . Nimitz urged on his commanders the same policy principle of " calculated risk " that he himself had followed in ordering his ships to Midway . He explained : " You shall interpret this to mean the avoidance of exposure of your force to attack by superior enemy forces without good prospect of inflicting , as a result of such exposure , greater damage on the enemy . " <P> Unmentionable Word . His gamble paid off . In the resulting battle , the enemy lost four irreplaceable carriers and the momentum that had propelled him from victory to victory . For the Japanese , Midway became an unmentionable word . Nimitz indulged himself in a rare pun : " Perhaps we will be forgiven if we claim that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than three years of hard , bitter fighting remained , that single , three-day battle marked the turning point of the Pacific war , the beginning of the end of Japanese ambitions .
