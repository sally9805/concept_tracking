Geoffrey Wagner , a British novelist now living in this country , announced recently in an English magazine that , " American publishing has become big business . " In his view , this is a calamity . " Most small publishers of interest , " he says , are being swallowed up by a few big firms . The survivors , he claims , are adopting a " blockbuster technique " which has " resulted in astronomical pre-publication deals , movie tie-ins , etc . " Although " the killings are much bigger than they used to be , " Mr. Wagner believes this is a bad thing , especially for novelists . It helps nobody but the insolent and materialistic publishers , " gloating over their stock exchange 1 isti ngs . " This lament is simply an echo of rumors which have been rustling around in the American ( and British ) literary world for several years . So long as they were confined to this milieu ? notoriously flighty and gossip-prone ? they could do little harm . About 1961 , however , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumors , fads , and hunches . Soon a lot of supposedly hardheaded brokers , speculators , and investment counselors convinced themselves that publishing really was becoming a big business , with an extraordinary growth potential . The upshot was that a good many people got badly burned . They started buying publishing stocks ? the relatively few available to the public on the stock exchanges and over-the-counter ? with no more discrimination than they had shown a little earlier , when they plunged into the so-called space-age and electronics industries . Prices shot up , in spite of warnings from several worried publishers that there was no rational basis for such enthusiasm . The boom was brief . In 1962 publishing stocks dropped as swiftly as they had risen , to an average of less than half of their previous highs . At this writing , however , they are beginning to creep up again . Brokers are issuing surveys of the publishing industry ; some investment funds are showing an interest ; and even a few authors ? inspired perhaps by accounts such as Mr. Wagner 's ? have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some use to try to sort out the facts from the myths about publishing ; and to look at the various parts of the business such as text-book , paperback , juvenile , and " trade " publishing ? which operate in quite different ways . ( It would be unfair to expect Mr. Wagner to do this . After all , he specializes in fiction . ) To begin with , is publishing actually Big Business ? In comparison with other industries ? steel , chemicals , automobiles , air lines , or even the ladies ' garment trade ? it is quite small . The total sales of all American book publishers climbed above 81 billion a year only in 1960 ? and that includes all texts , encyclopedias , reference books , and paperbacks , as well as trade books i.e. , ordinary hardbound fiction and non-fiction sold through bookstores . For the last decade book sales have been growing at a steady but unspectacular rate of about 10 per cent a year ; they may total close to $1.5 billion in 1963 . Do a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Publishing is one of the most competitive of all businesses . Nobody can be quite sure how many firms are engaged in it , since anybody can bring out a book now and then for only a modest investment . But if you count only those firms which published at least five books in 1962 , you would find ( according to Publishers ' Weekly ) 470 of them . No one company published as much as 3 per cent of the total number of titles . Are " most small publishers of interest " being swallowed up by their giant competitors ? Far from it . Every year some companies disappear , through bankruptcy or merger , but new ones constantly take their place . Today there are more firms in the business than ever before ? and some of the liveliest and most " interesting " are only a few years old . The representative firm ? if one can speak of such a thing in so diverse an industry ? probably has got bigger ( in sales volume and number of titles published ) in recent years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of population and of the whole economy . Then , too , rising costs of paper , printing , postage , and everything else have forced publishers to look for every possible economy ; and some savings do result from large-scale operations . As a consequence , many houses have tried to round out their line with paperback , juvenile , and other departments , in addition to the traditional trade books . This seems , however , to be a self-limiting process . Publishing is a peculiarly personal business . Whenever a firm gets so big that it can no longer give constant , intimate attention to each author ? if it begins to turn out books like so many cans of beans ? then it probably is on the verge of a decline . Its writers will soon drift away to smaller , nimbler , ment with the rest of the world have led to a growing interest in serious non-fiction ? particularly history , biography , politics , and international affairs . This kind of subject matter , for the same reason , is attracting many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more exciting . and sometimes more fantastic , than the world of fiction . When men are exploring sunken cities beneath the sea , preparing journeys to the moon , building megadeath weapons , creating new nations by the score , cruising under the polar ice cap , and staging rebellions every other weekend , it is hard for a novelist ? short of genius ? to compete . As Philip Roth recently said : " The actuality is continually outdoing our talents , and the culture tosses up figures daily that are the envy of any novelist The world we have been given , the society and the community , has ceased to be as suitable or as manageable a subject for the novelist as it once may have been . " 3 . Many former buyers of light fiction ? romance , Westerns , mysteries , adventure stories ? now get the same commodity on television , free . 4 . Among serious fiction writers . one large group now seem ( in the words of a veteran publisher ) to be " more concerned with self-expression than with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetic novelists . With them , and with most of the critics who make " serious " literary reputations , storytelling has become disreputable . Their main concern is with sensibility , with the inner drama of the psyche , not with the large events of the outside world . Often they are accomplished craftsmen . Their style is luminously burnished . . . they write en two levels , or even three . . . their work contains more symbols than a Chinese band . it may plumb the depths of the human soul ... it may be ( in Felicia Lamport 's phrase ) as deeply felt as a Borsalino hat . But all too often it just is n't much fun to read . If such exercises in occupational therapy do n't sell very well , the author has small grounds for complaint .. He has written them , after all , primarily to massage his own ego and to harvest critico-academic bay leaves . Since he is n't interested in a mass audience , why should it be interested in him ? Does this ' neon that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not . Publishers remain incorrigibly hope-fu ; last year they brought out 1,787 new novels ? an all-time high ? even though they probably lost money on a majority of them . ( A first novel , for example , is lucky to sell more than three thousand copies ; while the publisher 's break-even point is about seven thousand . ) They keep trying because there is always a chance that the next unknown novelist will turn out to be a Richard McKenna . His first book , The Sand Pebbles , won a major prize novel contest , was serialized in the Saturday Evening Post , became a book-club selection and stood for many weeks at or near the top of the bestseller list . Then , too , every good publisher brings out some novels every year which he knows will lose money , simply because he believes in the book 's quality or the author 's notyet-fully-developed talent . If he is a sensible businessman , why does n't a publisher take on only best-sellers ? Some have tried ; but they have been no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody has yet figured out a system for predicting with certainty how a novel or general non-fiction book will sell , or whether it may be a book-club selection , or what appeal it may have for reprinters . The successful trade-book editor still has to operate on an indefinable mixture of taste , experience , hunch , and personal conviction . Against such unpredictable odds , how can a publisher survive ? If he depended only on trade books , his chances would make an actuary blanch . But , although such books get most of the public attention and practically all of the review space , they make up only a small part of the book business ? less than S per cent of total sales . Consequently the prudent publisher usually tries to hedge his bets by developing other lines . For example , textbooks or juveniles or paperbacks , each of which brings in more money for the industry as a whole than hardbound trade books do . ( In the case of textbooks , nearly four times as much . ) Moreover , juveniles and textbooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales seem to
