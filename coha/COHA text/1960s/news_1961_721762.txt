txt " This is an explosive situation that has n't exploded . " That was the way a Federal official described the impact of 50,000 Cuban refugees on Miami . The refugees  --  there are about ? enough to fill the 52,000-seat Polo Grounds  --  have come to this resort city to escape the regime of Premier Fidel Castro . On March SC , Miami was designated a " distressed area " by the Department of Labor . The level of unemployment in Dade County is 6.8 per cent . But seven nights a week Pan American flight 422 comes in from Havana with a fresh load of refugees . Other flights and escapes by boat bring the total number of arriving exiles to about 125 a day  --  almost 900 a week . 33,000 Jobless In County Without counting the refugees , there are 30,300 more breadwinners in Dade County than there are jobs . To keep adding refugees to this workscarce economy is to put it under corrosive and steadily mounting pressures . A church relief executive , writing to his headquarters , observed : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been both generous and helpful . But the generosity of the moment tends to sour as a temporary crisis shows signs of becoming permanent . " Relief measures , developed on short notice and without previous experience , may buy time for days or weeks , but not for months . One sees each day more evidence of a growing resistance in hostility among whites , Negroes and Spanishspeaking groups , many of them unemployed and unaided , who see their job potential threatened . " Seek Service Jobs A large downtown drug and variety store had employed mostly local sales help until last fall , when it began taking on bilingual Cubans . Now , of nine girls in blue smocks on the floor during the day shift , only one is an old hand . A large proportion of the service staffs of the hotels in Miami Beach , especially kitchen workers and bellhops , are refugees . " The main difficulty is they go to the back door and offer their services for any price . " a spokesman for a waiters ' union said . The Cubans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what seems to be a genuine lightness of heart . If they can , they do much for one another , especially within broad family circles . For example , Mrs. Angelita C. Sanchez counts forty-three members of her clan here . For a time eighteen of them were living in her five-room rented cottage . A relief administrator said of the refugees : " When they first come here they are absorbed by their relatives and friends , which shows the nobility of the relatives , and after a few weeks , when they find they ca n't get work , they come in here and say , ' I ca n't keep on living in their house , ' which shows the nobility of the guests . " They 're not spongers . But the one who rents the place gets poorer and poorer . " Unequal Competition The situation is explosive because so many of the refugees are looking for work , competing with unskilled United States citizens for the Iower-paying jobs . The competition is not always equal . Because they have learned how to live on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cubans can afford to work for less money than a native Floridian , who can not support his family and pay his bills with less than $60 a week . The refugees are largely educated , middle or upper-class Cubans , including many professionals , and they make eager , desirable employes , " You remember the depression ? That 's what it will be like here  --  breadlines , " a labor union executive said . Another reason the situation is explosive is that many of the Cubans here are in revolutionary ferment , often at crosspurposes . Right-Wingers profess to see the strong taint of Castro or communism on LeftWingers , and Left-Wingers berate Right-Wingers for alleged complicity with the former dictator , Fulgencio Batista . " I would gladly kill that man today , " a labor leader in exile said of a former Batista , aide , bringing both fists down on a desk in a tiny windowless office of a misty revolutionary meeting hall . Five other leaders sat arotind  --  the desk , gathered under a bare bulb hanging by a wire from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orlol . Esteban ? Ventura , who headed the national police and is now living here . However , his enemies appear to be acutely aware that bloodshed would be to the disadvantage of the whole Cuban community . A tall , gray-haired man nearly 60 years old stepped out of a Augee food center carrying milk . A photographer prepared to take a picture , but the man objected . " Take me when I have a machine gun in my hands , not when I have two containers of milk , " he said . A street battle occurred here two weeks ago among factious refugees . The police are on the alert for others . The dangerous time is the late afternoon and evening . A plan is now being worked out to open several large schools for after-hours use as recreation centers . Optimism Expressed Despite the apprehension , there is a certain confidence that there will be no explosion . Assessments vary , there is some whistling in the dark , but there is so much self-consciousness here that the optimism appears to be justified . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert King High , observed : " Our economy is statistically shown to be based about 62 per cent on tourists , and because of that we are an area that has just so many jobs , and when you fill them , there just are n't any more . The situation will be worse when our season ends . " In mid-April , the tourist havens will cut back their service payrolls . So far this year , hotel and motel business is 11 per cent below that of 1940 . Beyond this slowness in the season , there has been no disruption whatever of tourist pleasures here . The designation of Miami as a " distressed area " has real impact in the lives of fathers who are already behind in their mortgage payments and can not get work of any . kind . But outwardly , Miami still looks like a boom town of pleasure . But Dr. Russell Stevenson , resident director of the Protestant Latin-American Emergency Committee , said : " For the refugee , Miami 's a. dead-end street at the moment ? as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nursing their grievances is concerred , and as far as settling down in a Spanish ghetto and not getting absorbed into the whole American community is concerned . " Marshall Wise , director of the Federal Emergency Cuban Relief Program , said : " I do n't see how the community here  --  local , state or county  --  could possibly afford to bear this burden . The community has strained itself to the seams already . This is basically a national problem . " President Kennedy has designated $4,000,000 in mutual security funds for the relief of Cuban refugees in the United States . There is no other substantial-source of cash help . The Federal figure would come to about $80 for each refugee here , but there is a marked reluctance among the Cubans to ask for helg , and so far only a few moreihan an 5,000 have been en/ rolled for welfare checks . The maximum grant is $100 a month for each family The largest and busiest voluntary relief center - here is the Spanish Catholic Center , which occupies half of a four-story building annexed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street , the city 's main shopping area . Within three miles of the Federal Government 's Cuban Refugee Center there are ten centers operated by Protestant Churches under the administrative umbrella of the Protestant Latin-American Emergency Committee . Several social welfare agencies also offer help . Used clothing , bundles of groceries , clinic treatment , classes in English , small cash gifts and counsel can be obtained at most Of these . The centers are , for the most part , dependent upon contributions to keep their work going . Cubans will frequently break off chatting with a reporter , lapse into formality long enough to make what sounds like a prepared statement of gratitude to the people of the United States , and then go on chatting . One man , thinking it insufficient to speak his gratitude , insisted on writing it out and signing it . This is not to imply that the refugees are ungrateful . They have fled their homeland , leaving possessions behind . They have last much . They have received genuine kindness here , and they are grateful in the ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their movements remind them to pay their obeisance with carefulness , and they do . They are not the only ones ' who are self-conscious . The United States Government is aware that , if Dr. Castro loses power , the refugees will carry back to Cuba strong views of the United States : The refugees here are mostly of the opinionmaking class , and the United States wants their opinion to be high . Mayor High commented : " There has been no serious police problem as the direct result of the addition to the community of thousands of people who speak another language , a people who have come here without any money , and some who have come here with just the shirts on their backs and some without even that . " I regard this as the greatest opportunity that the United States has had to show that we are what we say we are . I like the Cubans , and they know I like them , and I respect them . and they know I respect them , and I just can't. believe they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
