Italy found itself with a new government last week , its 27th since 1945 and quite possibly its most unwieldy . Incoming Premier Mariano Rumor named 27 Cabinet members , a postwar record . They will be supported by perhaps as many as 57 under secretaries ( up from 40 ) , vying for cars , chauffeurs , parking spaces and all the other perquisites of office . There were reasons for the glut . Rumor was intent on maintaining as broad a base of political support as possible , and his crowded Cabinet represented nearly every faction in his lumpy Center-Left government . Despite the skepticism that greeted the crazy-quilt coalition , however , the formation of a government was no small achievement in itself , in view of recent intraparty strife and rising domestic turbulence . Last week strikes and demonstrations by millions of workers and students broke out from Sicily to the industrial North . <P> A majority of the Cabinet posts , as expected , went to Rumor 's Christian Democratic Party . The C.D. 's 17 Ministers represent every shading in the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the far left and the Fanfanani ( followers of former Premier Amintore Fanfani ) to Rumor 's own moderate rightists . The wildly fragmented Socialists picked up a total of nine ministries , including foreign affairs for veteran Socialist Leader Pietro Nenni , 77 . The deputy premiership , too , went to a Socialist-Francesco de Martino , who is Nenni 's subordinate in the party but has now become his superior in the government . Only the far-out leftists were unrepresented . The Republicans , third and smallest party in the coalition , picked up one ministry . <P> Once his Cabinet was sworn in by President Giuseppe Saragat at the Palazzo Quirinale last week , Rumor continued work on the policy statement that he will present to the Parliament . He will almost certainly reaffirm Italy 's commitment to NATO , call for reform of university and school laws and press for increases in worker pensions . Rumor 's skill in allotting posts across the coalition 's entire range assures him of support from about 360 of the chamber 's 630 deputies . All his agility as a compromiser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce the social reforms that Italy so urgently needs .
