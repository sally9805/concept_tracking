Outspoken as they were , McKissick and the committee on presidential credibility were the soul of restraint compared to what followed . Sweeping in with the brisk authority of a North Sea gale , British Press Lord Cecil King , 66 , promised that his strictures on the U.S. press would be " mild and moderate . " But anyone who reads King 's raw and racy London Daily Mirror ( circ. over 5,000,000 ) should have known that mildness and moderation are not traits that he admires . <P> <P> " I merely deplore that you are producing unreadable , unmanageable newspapers , " he began . " Some of your foreign correspondents and your Washington correspondents are excellent journalists . As guests at the dinner table , they are good value . On television they have an impressive fluency and sonority . In the magazines , they write well , brilliantly sometimes . " Yet what they write for their daily papers is often " quite appalling , long , loose , rambling and repetitive . " This lifeless writing results , King declared , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news of its own inherent drama . They cast away the succulent flesh and offer the reader dry bones , coated with an insipid sauce of superfluous verbiage . They reject the flashing , illuminating phrase , which can make an unknown foreign statesman come vividly alive , or a dash of wit which may relieve the tedium unavoidably contained in much important news . " <P> <P> Sacred Cows . By trying so diligently to be objective , said King , U.S. newspapers fail to " reflect the vitality of life in the American city , which is so striking to the British newspaperman . No New York paper communicates the salt tang of life , the wit of New York , its physical and intellectual energy , its cynicism and idealism , its pursuit of profit and of scholarship . " <P> Editorials , continued an unflagging King , are even worse . " Could a real living journalist have assembled in his human mind such a collection of dim platitudes which lead so inexorably to a non-conclusion ? " As for columnists , " I wonder if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap ; if it was not possible for an editor or a publisher to obtain for a song so much copy of such high respectability ? " Many columnists " conceal an idea the size of a pea in a stack of dry straw . Does nobody discipline them ? Does nobody make them rewrite or throw a column away ? Are they sacred cows that are allowed to wander unmolested through your pages ? " <P> Since local retailers will always need an advertising medium , King concluded , " the newspaper may stay alive as a business , while its primary function is ebbing away . In America , television journalism , radio journalism , magazine journalism are all livelier and more professional than the newspapers . "
