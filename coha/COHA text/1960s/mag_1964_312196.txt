Ever since Moscow and Peking openly split on Communist ideology , Mao Tse-tung 's high command has been quietly cracking down on everyone rash enough to question the hard-line Marxism separating him from the hated Khrushchev revisionists . Apparently , the purges have not been too successful , for last week the shadow of dialectic oblivion was falling on Mao 's two most influential victims so far , and it had be gun to look as if the biggest public brainwash since 1957 was not far away . <P> Latest victims were two widely respected intellectuals , Central Committee Member Yang Hsien-chen , party the oretician and former president of the elite Higher Party School , and Historian ( and onetime English professor ) Chou Ku-cheng , whose General History of China has been a standard work for nearly 30 years . Their crime was pure heresy : contradicting Mao 's infallible doctrine that " everything tends to divide into two , " which is the very foundation for Peking 's dialectical battle with Moscow . According to the " one-into-two theory , " disputes are never resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peaceful coexistence is impossible . " The contradictions and struggle between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism can not be dealt with by mediation , " warns Peking . <P> According to Yang , the one-into-two doctrine is backwards , suggesting that the Moscow-Peking split is therefore reparable . " The law of the development of things is that two merge into one , " he said in a series of lectures and articles that were widely read by party intellectuals . " All opposing social forces are merging . To study dialectics is to learn the capability of linking two opposite ideologies into one . " <P> Historian Chou went even farther . According to the Peking People 's Daily , he was " in recent years " teaching the " convergence of all ideologies - the revolutionary , the unrevolutionary , the nonrevolutionary , and even the anti-revolutionary . " Charged the newspaper angrily : " There is no ' convergence , ' but only round after round of struggle as a result of which either you or I will live or die . " <P> In all probability , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But disgrace was doom enough for the pair since it presumably means they will publish no more books and teach no more classes . Which might go to prove their point that even the class struggle has its limits .
