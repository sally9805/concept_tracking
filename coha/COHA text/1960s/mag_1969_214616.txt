The U.S. Secretary of the Interior these days is a kind of super-Noah , charged with rescuing a nearly lost legion of imperiled animal species . Almost 55,000 people-Indians , Eskimos , Aleuts-are also his special wards . He has the duty and considerable power to salvage the vitiated environment : polluted air , desecrated lands and impure water . Yet , when Richard Nixon appointed him to the office , Walter Hickel seemed to many critics to be more of an anti-Noah . <P> As Governor of Alaska , Hickel had been closely identified with the oil interests . Prior to his extended and embarrassing confirmation hearings before the U.S. Senate Interior Committee , he made such unfortunate observations as : " I think we have had a policy of conservation for conservation 's sake . " Several Senators and the nation 's most potent conservation organizations bitterly opposed Hickel 's appointment . In only eight weeks , however , the new Secretary has shown an extraordinary flair for confounding his critics . Michael Mc-Closkey , acting executive director of the powerful Sierra Club , says : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think their minds are not closed to welcome evidence . " <P> Systematic Slaughter . That is what they have been getting of late . Last week Hickel make a brief , bravura-like foray into the Florida Everglades to expose an impending natural disaster-the extinction of the American alligator ( Alligator mississipiensis ) . One of 87 species threatened with extermination in the U.S. , alligators are being systematically slaughtered by poachers who hunt them for their valuable skins . <P> <P> Encouraged by the huge profits to be made , 200 full-time and 3,500 part-time poachers kill an estimated 40,000 alligators every year . They work in relative safety , able to lose themselves quickly in the labyrinthine waterways when park rangers come along . <P> By publicizing the alligator problem , Hickel is bringing powerful pressure to bear on Congress to adopt strong conservationist legislation . He supports a measure that would make it a federal offense to ship across state lines any animal or bird considered to be threatened with extinction , or their skins , pelts or plumage . Carrying with it a maximum penalty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law might serve to slow down some of the alligator-skin traffic . <P> While the alligator is one of the most seriously endangered species , there is another vanishing animal that Hickel has moved to protect-Alaska 's musk ox ( Ovibos moschatus ) . When Hickel was Governor of the state , the legislature passed a law to permit hunting of the helpless musk ox . Hickel vetoed it . Recently , the Alaska legislature passed a new bill allowing the hapless ox to be hunted . As Interior Secretary , with power over federal acreage , Hickel immediately placed Nunivak Island , the federally owned haven for musk oxen , off-limits to all hunters. -
