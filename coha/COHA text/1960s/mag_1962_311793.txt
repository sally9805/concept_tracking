The proposed union of four major American Protestant churches is a cart with four wheels-and one of the wheels is slow to turn . The Presbyterian and Episcopal churches and the United Church of Christ continue generally to favor the dramatic project that Presbyterian Eugene Carson Blake put forth in 1960 . But the largest denomination involved , the 10 million-member Methodist Church , has deep doubts . Washington 's John Wesley Lord , though he is one of the few Methodist bishops who speak out strongly in favor of merger , says : " Methodists have the least enthusiasm , and with good reason . We 're strong ; what do we need ? " <P> Many , like Chicago 's Bishop Charles W. Brashares , fear that all talk of complete merger is just that-all talk . Says Bra-shares : " Talk of unity can be a red herring to keep us from doing something that we should be doing . " <P> Within the atmosphere of general hesitancy , many Methodist clergymen see specific obstacles to merger : <P> &gt; " We look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Detroit . Bishop Marshall Russell Reed . " As long as the Episcopal Church holds to apostolic succession . I do n't see how there could be a merger . " A basic difference between the Methodists and the Episcopalians centers on the Episcopal belief that a minister must be ordained by a bishop who himself was consecrated in the line of succession from the time of Christ 's Apostles . Methodist ministers are ordained by both a bishop and other elders , who do not claim that they are part of an unbroken chain back to the time of Christ . <P> &gt; " Any proposed merger would involve concessions on someone 's part . " says Dr. William D. White , pastor of the Elmhurst ( Ill . ) Methodist Church . " For instance , Methodists are against drinking , while Episcopalians believe in moderation . " <P> &gt; " I have no doubt that churches and denominations can be too small to function effectively in the world . I am just as sure that they can be too big , and I suggest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bishop Gerald Kennedy of Los Angeles . " If I could cast one vote which would make all Christians Methodists , I would not cast the vote . " <P> &gt; " I 'm very much interested in unity , but I 'm not interested in union , " argues Dr. Theodore Palmquist , pastor of Washington 's Foundry Methodist Church . " In Protestantism , division is our strength because we allow for differences in opinion . If you 're more emotional you can go to an emotional church ; if you like ritual , you could choose the Episcopal Church . " <P> A recent Boston University poll of Methodist clergy and laymen found only 23% advocating that Methodists " should seek full union with all Christian bodies willing to explore the possibility . " Sixty-three percent preferred that Methodists only cooperate with other Christian bodies in activities that can be done better to gether than separately . Says the Rev. H. F. Lawhorn of Atlanta 's Capitol View Methodist Church : " We ought to remember what Christ said-'Other sheep have I , . not of this fold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman Catholic , which claims more than 42 million believers in the U.S. , 550 million in the world .
