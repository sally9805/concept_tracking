contributions might be valuable enough to give it added prestige . With equally serious purpose , he had accepted the presidency of the New Orleans Chess Club and gave the most careful attention to directing it . Moreover , everything about life in New Orleans seemed perfect and complete to him . Though she would not go to see Edwin Booth in Richard III and Much Ado About Nothing at the Gaiety or Hackett in The Merry Wives of Windsor at the St. Charles , his mother was persuaded to occupy with him a loge grillee at the Orleans Theater , where two grand and two comic operas were given each week ; indeed , she could not very well decline , for such loges , screened as they were from public gaze , were almost universally accepted as suitable for persons of both sexes who were in second mourning , as well as ladies who were enceinte . The season was a brilliant one , including such offerings as William Tell , Robert le Diable , Il Trovatore and Les Huguenots . It was seldom that Paul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took up fencing again , practicing regularly at Pepe Llulla 's salle d'escrime in Exchange Place , where he had taken his first lessons ; and he was never missing at the family dinners and the informal soirees given by his friends . All these diversions were a source of genuine pleasure ; so were the long rambles which he managed to make part of his daily routine . The sights of the city streets held his rapt attention , their sounds were music to his ears . He seldom passed a flower vendor without buying a nosegay for his mother or a boutonniere for himself and he was almost as likely to accept a small brown paper square containing the typical rice cakes known as calas tout chaud . He resisted the siren song of " Eks ! Fresh eks ! Tres por oun dima , " for fresh eggs , like salty oysters would be delivered straight to the door ; but sometimes he succumbed to the cry of " Glace a la vanille ! " and , accepting the peddler 's glass , ate the ice cream as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also usually paused when he heard the musical note produced by striking a metal triangle with a metal bar , thus announcing the approach of the marchand de gaufresthe shaving cake man ; and the familiar figures of the chimney sweeps , the scissors grinders , and the palmetto merchants were all a welcome and integral part of his life . He never failed to stop and greet them with a smile and the same courtesy that they accordedhim . What did New York have to offer that could compare with this pleasant , easy understanding and comradeship between the privilegedand the lowly ? Nothing , absolutely nothing ! People in New York scurried through the streets as if the loss of a single minute was a disaster ; there was no time for fellowship . He had traveled and triumphed and it had been a great experience , it had given him a sense of fulfillment ; now he was ready to rest on his laurels in the surroundingsp207which he knew and loved . He was , therefore , disturbed , rather than otherwise , when Charles de Maurian brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Challenge to European Chess players . " he read . " The American Chess Association , it is reported , are about to challenge any player in Europe to contest a match with the young victor in the late passage of arms , for from 2,000 to 5,000 dollars a side , the place of meeting to be New York . If the battle-ground were to be London or Paris there can be little doubt , we apprehend , that a European champion would be found , but the best players in Europe are not chess professionals , but have other and more serious avocations , the interests of which forbid such an expenditure of time as is required for a voyage to the United States and back again . " " Staunton must have a vivid imagination , " Paul said , handing the clipping back to Charles . " Of course , there has n't been any such challenge . " Then , noticing a rather strange expression on his friend 's face , he added hastily , " That 's right , is n't it ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you mean , technically ? " " Well , perhaps officially would be the better word . As far as I know , the American Chess Association has n't officially issued any challenge . But you must realize that you had hardly defeated Paulsen when the idea of one began to take form . Did n't you ? " " NoIwell , after I made the speech of presentation to Paulsen when he won the gold medal , I said that I challenged all the magnates of the Old World to enter the lists against him . Of course , I was just talking . But afterward I realized , when I said that , I was subconsciously wishing I could be the one to pick up the glove . However , I never told anyone I felt that way . I was rather ashamed that I had . And I do n't any more . " " There was no reason why you should have been ashamed . As you see , other people have felt the same way . " " Then there has been a challenge ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knowofficially . But I think there will be very soon now . " " What makes you think so ? " " Whythis clipping for one thing . And other things , too . " " What other things ? " " Wait and see , " said Charles , pocketing his slip of paper . " Want to have a game , giving me odds of Rook ? " He declined to discuss the matter any further and , indeed , Paul did not press him to do so . The former continued to feel disturbed , rather than exultant , at the possible turn of events and Charles was quick top208realize this . Accordingly , it was not until after one of the committees of the Orleans Club , of which he was a member , had actually sent a formal challenge to the great English master , that De Maurian showed Paul a copy of it : " On behalf of the New Orleans Chess Club , we have the honour to invite you to visit our city , and there meet Mr. Paul Morphy in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to observe that we are prompted no less by the desire to become personally acquainted with one whom we have so long admired than by the very natural anxiety to ascertain the strength of our American players by the decisive criterion of actual conflict over the board ... . " It must now be a matter of general desire to fix , by actual contest with the best European amateurs , the rank which American players shall hold in the hierarchy of Chess . " For this purpose it was suggested that Mr. Morphy , the winner at the late Congress and the present American champion , should cross the ocean and boldly encounter the distinguished magnates of the TransAtlanticChess circles ; but it unfortunately happens that serious family reasons forbid Mr. Morphy , for the present , to entertain the thought of visiting Europe . " It therefore becomes necessary to arrange , if possible , a meeting between the latter and the acknowledged European champion and to us it is a subject of congratulation that the sceptre of Trans-Atlantic chess is wielded by one who , with respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for other reasons , enjoys facilities for accepting our invitation possessed by no other European player ... . " Fully subscribing to the wisdom of the proposal made by you in the introduction to the Book of the Tournament , we beg leave to express our entire willingness to insert a clause providing that one half at least of the games shall be open ones .... ' With this letter was enclosed a list of propositions for the conditions of the match , to which Staunton was invited to suggest any alterations he might deem advisable . The proposed stakes were $5,000 a side ; and , should the English player lose , the sum of $1,000 ( 200 ) was to be paid to him out of the stakes to meet his expenses in accepting the challenge . The winner of the first eleven games should be declared the victor . The place of the match should be New Orleans , and the date of commencement May 1st , or any other day in 1858 agreeable to Staunton . The time occupied in deliberating on any move should not exceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flush , which fast became deeper and deeperp209spread over his face . When he had finished , he looked up at his friend with genuine consternation . " I ca n't think what made you do it , Charles ! That isI know you meant it kindly , I know you and the others who signed their names to it are fond of me and proud of me . But Staunton is n't going to like this at all . I do n't like it at all ! It 's presumptuous , it 's preposterous to supposefor a minute that a man like Staunton would come all the way to New Orleans to play with me ! Family reasons , indeed . ' What do you think he 's going to say to such a suggestion as that ? " " I 'm eagerly waiting to find out , " Charles replied calmly . " There are family reasons why it would be hard for you to go to Europe , are n't there ? " " Of course there are ! Hard ! Reasons that would make it impossible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to come to New Orleans ! " " Well , then the next step will have to be taken . " " What step ? " " The step that overcomes all the reasons that prevent you from going to Europe . " " Charles , you 're dreaming . " " There 's no harm in that , is there ? Now let 's have a game . The usual odds ? " The Carnival season was now approaching its height and Paul was thankful , rather than otherwise , for the fresh diversion that this offered to those he was already enjoying at the opera , the salle d'escrime and the soirees . He did not want to dwell on the scorn and sarcasm which would probably characterize Staunton 's reply to the presumptuous challengeif he sent one . The revival of enthusiasm for Carnival celebrations in the circles where Paul moved offered opportunities for a welcome change of thought . During the Forties , the time-honored festivities had deteriorated to a point where many Creoles took only a half-hearted interest in them and no active part . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , after unorganized maskers had engaged in a free-for-all fight , through clouds of flour and dust , with the most ruffianly elements of the city ; and the general feeling of distaste had found public expression in L'Abeille : " Thousands of persons who yesterday had located themselves in the windows , balconies , and upon the sidewalks of the different streets through which the procession of masquers usually pass , were sadly disappointed in their non-appearance , " the paper stated . " This long established custom , which in the palmy days of the Ancien Regime was wont to be celebrated with grotesque pageantry . . . has , within the last few years , been gradually falling into disuse , not the lessp210so from the abandonment of the old master spirits who led on the merry crowd , than from the lewd and miserable crew who , of late years , have been permitted to join in the celebration . It is the custom , however , more honored in the breach than in the observance ' and we hope it will be henceforth be regarded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comeback had been staged soon after the Fifties were ushered in , but this was due largely to the fine display of the volunteer fire companies and to the spectacular performance of Jenny Lind , rather than to any carnival organization . It was not until six years later that a welcome new order of things began with the newly-formed Mystic Krewe of Comus , an offspring of the " Cowbellion de Rakin Society " which had long flourished in Mobile . As 1857 had marked the period of the Morphys ' deepest mourning , they had heard little and seen nothing of the Krewe 's first triumphs ; now they shared the gratification of their friends in the revival of what they regarded the true spirit of Carnival through such an appropriate medium . Even though half-mourning still prevented their attendance at the beautiful ball in the Orleans Theater , they joined the enthusiastic crowds to watch the parade , which had for its design " The Classic Pantheon , " and in the general excitement which it aroused . For days its Tableaux Roulants were the main topic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by butterflies ; Ceres drawn by oxen , Bacchus by leopards and Diana by stags . Juno had her peacocks , Venus her swans , Aurora her winged horse . On and on came the floats , lighted by Negroes who acted as torchbearers , and each tableau , as it came into view , seemed to surpass its predecessor in splendor . Everything had combined to make the celebration a success : the weather had been perfect , there had been no disorders , and out-of-town visitors , including many from Mobile , had helped to swell the crowds to some twenty thousand eager onlookers . By night , " the whole city was in motion and both public and private masquerade balls supplemented the more exclusive private entertainments . Like the tableaux , each sought to surpass the others in magnificence and the fancy dress affairs given by the Young Men 's Society , in which the " Celestial Empire Club " arrayed in scarlet Chinese costumes , went through a series of pantomimes and drills , was very generally accorded the highest claim . " The following day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair of the kind ever gotten up in this city . In years agone , " it continued , " there were many brilliant and novel features in the celebration of Mardi Gras ; but , in the memory of our oldest inhabitants , nothing which would begin to compare in taste , brilliancy and beauty with that of the Mystic Krewe last night . " Charles de Maurian knew better than to interpolate a false note inp211the cheerful chatter which at last prevailed again in the Morphy drawing rooms . Therefore , as weeks went by and still no unwelcome answercame to the challenge , Paul concluded that the question had been dropped . At last , however , Charles sought him out again with anothercopy of the Illustrated London News in his hand and passed it over to him without comment . " We have been favored with a copy of the deft which the friends of Mr. Paul Morphy , the chess champion of the United States , have transmittedto Mr. Staunton , " he read . " The terms of this cartel are distinguished by extreme courtesy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The exception in question , however , ( we refer to the clause which stipulates that the combat shall take place in New Orleans ! ) appears to us utterly fatal to the match : and we must confessour astonishment that the intelligent gentlemen who drew up the con-ditions did not themselves discover this . Could it possibly escape theirpenetration that if Mr. Paul Morphy , a young gentlemen without family tics or professional claims upon his attention , finds it inconvenient to anticipate , by a few months , an intended voyage to Europe , his proposedantagonist who is well known for years to have been compelled , by laborious literary occupation to abandon the practice of Chess beyond the indulgence of an occasional game , must find it not merely inconvenient , but positively impracticable , to cast aside all engagements and undertake a journey of many thousand miles for the sake of a chessencounter ? Surely the idea of such a sacrifice is not admissible for a single moment . If Mr. Morphyfor whose skill we entertain the liveliest admirationbe desirous to win his spurs among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his purposed visit next year ; he will then meet in this country , in France , and Germany , and in Russia , many champions whose names must be as household words to him , ready to test and do honour to his prowess . " " What did I tell you ? " Paul said angrily , handing back the paper . " Could it possibly escape the penetration of Mr. Morphy 's friends that if a young gentleman without family ties or professional claims would find it inconvenient to cross the Atlantic , his proposed antagonist , a gentleman engaged in laborious literary occupations , could hardly undertake a journey of many thousand miles for the sake of a chess-encounter . ' I 'm not surprised at Staunton 's attitudeof course , he wrote that article himself ; he has free access to the columns of the Illustrated News ! But he has n't had the courtesy to write the Committee a personal letter , has he ? " " No , " Charles confessed , " he has n't . No doubt he thought such an . admission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . "  | " If he was discourteous , it was only what you deserved for being presumptuous . Besides , what about this trip to Europe next year ? This is the first I 've heard of it ! You 've put me in a very awkward position . " Charles had never seen his friend so excited . " Listen , Paul , " he said , speaking very earnestly , " you admitted , when you found out we had sent the challenge , that you knew why we had done itbecause we 're proud of you . And it is n't just New Orleans that 's proud of you any more . It is n't just New Orleans and New York . You do n't suppose for a moment , do you , that we acted without authority ? Why , six months ago , at the dinner of the Congress , Perrin said , in replying to a toast to the living players of France and England , that he hoped and believed the defeats he himself had undergone in those countries would be fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You were there when he made that statement . You must have heard him ! " " I suppose I did . Yes , I know I did . But I thought that was just talk , too , like my presentation speech to Paulsen . " " It was n't anything of the sort . The challenge was sent in our name because that was our privilegeyou belonged to us first . But you do n't any morethat is , we have to share youwith the world . I believe you when you say you did n't realize , in making that presentation speech to Paulsen , that you were secretly wishing that you could be the one to pick up the glove . I know you thought you were just talking . But do n't forget there 's many a true word spoken in jest . You were speaking some of them that day . " Paul was sitting with his head bent , his whole attitude one of depression , rather than hope . His face was half hidden , but Charles knew it was suffused with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he suspected that tears were very close to the veiled eyes . He put his arm around his friend 's shoulder . " Listen , Paul , " he said again . " Fred Edge has resigned from the New York Herald . He 's already started for England as a sort of avant courier for you . He did n't ask your consent , because he knew you would n't give it . But he 's acting with authority , too . " And , as Paul still did not answer or look up , Charles continued , in a gentler voice , " We 're counting on you , cher . I 've already talked to your mother and she agrees that we 're right . She wants you to go as much as we do . I 've engaged passage for you on that new Cunarder , the Arabia , sailing June 9th from New York . All your friends there are delighted at the prospect of seeing you again . And I understand there is an American family visiting in London just now that you wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not being indiscreet when I mention the name of Sheppard . The ladies are being presented at one of the June Drawing Rooms . "  |p214There  was not time to take the inland route back to New York ; it would have to be the Gulf of Mexico , the Caribbean and the Atlantic again . But , by a happy chance , the Philadelphia was about to sail from New Orleans ; at least seasickness would be somewhat assuaged amidst familiarsurroundings and familiar faces , at least there would be another enchanting interlude at Havana . The misgivings Paul felt as he started on this second journey were not for the earlier part of it , but for the part that was to come later . This time , too , the ocean was kinder to him than it had been the previousautumn ; instead of spending most of his days huddled miserably in his berth , he stayed on deck a great deal and , to his pleased surprise , he found congenial spirits among his fellow passengers . The acquaintances he had already made in Havana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to them and his prospects abroad had been instrumental in causing both the Captain General and the Bishop to include him in invitations to their respective palaces . At the end of the first lap of his journey , it was reassuring to find the St. Denis Hotel and the Metropolitan Club familiar territory , peopled with familiar friends ; and even the hustle and bustle of New York had lost the terrifying quality of their tension . Paul 's embarkation on the Arabia marked a red letter day in his personal life , as well as in the history of American chess . It was , perhaps , inevitable that there should have been a reaction to this sunny mood , even if he had not again fallen a victim of seasickness . At best , ocean travel seemed to him a monotonous experience , at worst , an endurance test . The size of the Arabia2,400 tons with accommodationsfor 180 passengershad at first reassured him , and her estimated speed of thirteen knots was also in her favor ; at that rate , the transAtlanticvoyage should not last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed beforehand . By the time the ten days were up , Paul had changed his mind . The Arabia pitched and rolled in midoceaneven worse than the Philadelphia when rounding Cape Hatteras ; the voyage seemed interminable . When Paul finally arrived at Liverpool in a dismal drizzle on the 21st of June , even the almost indomitable buoyancy of Fred Edge , who was again waiting to meet him , was temporarily blighted by Paul 's deep depression . " I 'm sorry you 've had such a miserable crossing , but that 's behind you now and I 'm sure you 'll enjoy the trip to London , " Edge told himp215with determined cheerfulness . " Lovely countryside , quite unlike any you 've ever seen : thatched cottages , village greens , flourishing hedges , rolling pastures , flocks of sheep , herds of fine cattle . " And , as none of this seemed to raise Paul 's spirits in the least , he rattled on , " I 've engagedrooms for us at Lowe 's Hotel on Surrey Street . The proprietor is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have much the same setup as you did in New YorkI mean , Lowe 's more or less the counterpart of Denis Julian , as regards both his business and his avocation . The place looks very comfortable to me . Not that you 'll be there much . Most of your time will be spent at the clubs , of course St. George 's , veryaristocratic ; the London Chess , right in the heart of the city ; the Philidorean Rooms , only recently opened . Each has its special backgroundand its individual attractions . For instance " " Suppose you wait to tell me about them when we 're settled in the train . Do you think I could get some coffee ? I believe perhaps if I could have a small black " Edge doubted this , regretfully . " We can have tea though , " he said , still speaking with great good cheer . " It 's almost tea time . And the tea 's very goodstrong , black , India tea . We English drink it with lots of milk and sugar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American ! " " Well , I 'm about half and half , I suppose . In New York , I feel like an American and in London , I feel like an Englishman . You know the old adage , When in Rome , etcetera . ' Well , that 's what I try to do . New York 's a wonderful city , but so is London . " " Is it always as cold as this , the latter part of June ? " " No , not always . . . . Well , here we are at Customsa mere formality . In just a few minutes now , we 'll be in our comfortable railway carriage , drinking nice hot tea . That 'll warm you up . " " I do n't feel as if I 'm ever going to be warm again . And you keep talking about going to London . We ca n't do that right away . We 've got to go first to Birmingham . We 've barely time to reach there for the beginning of the tournament . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postponed until August . " " You must be mistaken . Why , I had a letter from Mr. Thomas Avery , the President of the Birmingham Chess Club , enclosing this item from the Illustrated London News . " He took a clipping from his wallet andread aloud from it : " ANNUAL MEETING OF THE CHESS ASSOCIATION . It was noticed in our columns last week that the Chess-players ' Derby day was fixed to commence on the 22nd of June . The arrangementsof the local committee are , of course , not yet complete , but it is whispered that they have succeeded in insuring the presence of thep216American chess phenomenon , Paul Morphy , an attraction , of itself , sufficient to secure the largest attendance which has been known for years . ' There you are ! Surely someone would have let me know if there had been any change . " Fred shook his head doubtfully . " Yes , I should think someone would have . Still , I 'm very sure " Paul , however , was not to be dissuaded . Eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had not confided to Edge and which had no relation to chess , he persisted in taking the train to Birmingham . The drizzle by this time had become a downpour , and the long twilight , so beautiful in fair weather , seemed only to prolong a period of gloom between day and night ; the charm of the countryside was effectively dimmed by this semi-obscurity and the " good strong India tea " was not at all to Paul 's taste . He sat shivering in the part of the railway carriage farthest from the windows , which two English fellowtravelers had flung wide open , his warmest overcoat buttoned tightly around him and supplemented by a knitted muffler . Any further attempts to cheer him , Edge finally realized , were doomed to failure . Even so , he could hardly have foreseen an unrelieved continuance of untoward circumstances . He had been right about the postponement of the tournament ; there were no reservations for them at the Station Hotel , no message for them at the desk and no sign of preparation for such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were rather grudgingly accommodated in a small chilly room and , the kitchen having already closed , went dinnerless to bed . A note , dispatched early the next morning to Mr. Avery , resulted in an immediate call from that gentleman , whose regret at the inconvenience to which Mr. Morphy had been put was genuinely and most politely expressed ; but mingled with his apologies was the inescapable suggestion that postal service in the States must leave much to be desired . He had written to Mr. Morphy , advising him of the change in date as soon as this had been made ; he could not understand why his second letter had not been received before their distinguished guest left New Orleans . Of course , he would look forward to seeing Mr. Morphy again in August or , if they could prevail on him to stay on now for a few days , Mr. Avery was sure some offhand games could be arranged and Mr. Morphy would be a most welcome visitor , though no official contest could take place . Mr. Morphy , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cordiality failed to obliterate Paul 's first unfavorable impression of Birmingham which , moreover , his first experience with an English breakfast had intensified rather than improved . " Good strongp217India tea " had again made its appearance , along with porridge , kippered herring , grilled kidneys and toast on a rack to insure its coolness . A beverage presented as coffee had also been served , but Paul failed to recognize it as such and turned from it with repugnance . At a later hour , the bacon and eggs , undeniably excellent , might have placated him , but he did not consider them suitable for early morning consumption . Rain was still falling steadily and the hotel parlor , where he and Fred received their unhappy visitor , seemed to have absorbed much of the dampness in the outer atmosphere ; he was cold , hungry and annoyed . It required all his savoir-faire to reply that he appreciated Mr. Avery 's kindness , but that there were urgent reasons why he must reach London as soon as possible . Mr. Avery was not to give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably quite true that the American mail service could not compare in efficiency with that of the British Isles . They parted wtih mutual respect , if without mutual heartiness . Fred Edge was not suffering from either hunger or cold , as he had enjoyed his breakfast and was used to the English climate , but he , too , was annoyed . Why on earth could n't Paul have taken his word about the postponement of the tournament , instead of making this unnecessary stop ? The rooms at Lowe 's Hotel had been engaged for the night before and Lord Lyttleton , the President of the British Chess Association , together with several members of the St. George 's Club , had been expecting to welcome them there . Now the rooms might well have been let to someone else and the reception committee disbanded ; it would be hard to straighten these matters out , And what were the urgent reasons why Paul now wanted to reach London which were unconnected with chess and unaccounted for , as far as he , Fred , was concerned ? His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which Paul seemed to be indulging . This time , it was he who withdrew from companionship in the railway carriage , He was very close to sulking ; and it was Paul who broke in on the silence into which Fred had retreated . " Do you happen to know the dates of the Drawing Rooms ? " Paul inquired . " The dates of drawing rooms ? " Fred repeated . " What drawing rooms ? " " The ones that are held at Buckingham Palace . When young ladies are presented to the Queen . " " Ohthose ! No , I 'm sure I do n't . As I do n't know any young ladies who are likely to be presented to the Queen , there 's no reason why I should have been interested . "  | " Do the newspapers announce the dates and give the names of the young ladies beforehand ? " " I do n't know that , either . If they do , I have n't paid any attention to such announcements . Why should I ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I do happen to be interested . I have reason to believe that some friends of mine either have recently been presented or are shortly to be . I understand that all nationals have to be recommended by their own Ministers . I suppose I can get the information I need from the American Legation . I 'll go there the first thing tomorrow morning . " " My dear fellow , you ca n't do that ! At least until we 've found out what plans Lord Lyttleton may have made for you ! " " Could n't we find that out tonight ? I would n't like to go to the Legation , to make a first call , after normal visiting hours . But surely it does n't matter how late we go to the club ! " " Normally , it would n't . But you see they were prepared to receive you , formally , last evening . Since we did n't show up or send them any message beforehand , we ca n't simply break in on them now . As soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go around and find out the lay of the land . Then I 'll let you know about an appointment for tomorrow . But that 's got to be your first consideration . Otherwise , you might make an unfavorable impression . " Conversation again languished . But , before they reached London , the rain ceased and Paul admitted to himself , although not to Fred , that the fresh verdure of the countryside , the thatched cottages and fine flocks and herds in the rolling pastures did indeed have a great deal of charm . He was also intrigued with the vehicle which Fred selected from a row of similar ones drawn up outside the railway station : a low-hung , twowheeled , covered cab , drawn by one horse , with a driver perched on an elevated seat at the rear who permitted his reins to fall loosely over the top of the cab , but who started off at a goodly clip , as soon as he had them comfortably enclosed behind doors which folded over them like an apron . This was called a hansom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of J. A. Hansom , who had patented the style of conveyance some twenty-five years earlier . It had become amazingly popular , almost immediately . " I 'm not surprised . I think it 's very chic myself , " Paul said enthusiastically , and Fred sighed with relief . He had begun to be afraid that nothing was going right with this enterprise on which he had counted so much , which he had indeed made a considerable personal and professionalsacrifice in order to further . But if the mere sight of a hansom cab , let alone the experience of riding in one , could improve Paul'sp219mood , surely the comfortable quarters awaiting him at Lowe 's Hotel and the welcome he was sure to receive at St. George 's should certainly raise his spirits still further . Dinner , though it lacked seasoning and sauces , at least provided a great improvement on the fare in Birmingham . The sole , the beef , the cheese and the strawberries were really excellentbut did the English never cook potatoes except by boiling ? And , as for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really did not know which was worse , as an excuse for a sweet ! However , he admitted that he was adequately nourished when he and Edge left the dining room and said he would start unpacking while Fred went on to the club to reconnoitre and find out whether or not it was too late to present himself there that evening . Edge returned with a favorable reply : Lord Lyttleton had departed for the night , but had left a message saying he hoped Mr. Morphy would lunch with him the next day ; it was believed that Herr Lowenthal , who was also visiting London , and who expressed himself as being most eager to seeing Mr. Morphy again , might be among the other guests on this occasion . Meanwhile , Mr. Boden and Mr. Barnestwo of the " Five Great B 's " who formed such a strong phalanx among London amateurs were still on hand and so was a rather eccentric clergyman , whose name was actually Owen , but who insisted on being called only " Alter , " both in conversation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiarities , he was an excellent player . If this would be agreeable to Paul , " Alter " would engage him that very night ... . Paul had not the slightest desire to go out again ; he had still not wholly recovered from the effects of his seasickness , and his experience in Birmingham had done nothing to improve his condition . But he realized that he had been ungracious to Edge and was eager to make amends for this ; besides , the prospect of another drive in a hansom was really inviting . Instead of cutting Edge off short , as he had before , when the latter tried to describe the characteristics of the various clubs , he listened with unfailing interest , as they went clip-clop along the streets . It was apparently so called , partly because George was the Christian name of its founder and partly because its first meeting had been held at Beattie 's Hotel on George Street in the province of St. George . It had begun its existence in a burst of prosperity and popularityand , from the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its large , well-proportioned rooms . But , unfortunately , Mr. Beattie went into bankruptcy and St. George 's was turned out of doors . For several weeks , the club was homeless ; then it found refuge in the Polytechnic Institution , on Regent Street , where one of the chess addicts was a large stockholder . There again it was soon in flourishing condition ; its mem/bership became more and more distinguished ; and it was in this locale that Staunton played his first match with St. Amant and lost it . " But he won the second , as I recall it , in Paris , " Paul said . " Yes , and then declined to play again after stakes had been deposited for a third and final match . He pleaded ill health and went home . " Edge hesitated for a moment , before adding with obvious reluctance , " It 's unfortunatethat he 's beginning to acquire a reputation for finding some sort of excuse for not playing if he thinks there 's a chance that a game may go against him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to permit any risk of such an accusation . Like Caesar 's wife , he should be above suspicion . " " But if he really were ill , " Paul said tolerantly . " Well , let 's forget about him for a moment I suppose I 'll be meeting him within a day or two and then I can form my own estimate of him . Go on with your history of St. George 's . Is it still in the Polytechnic Institution ? " " No , its members were n't able to dine there , so they dwindled away . Then they were offered apartments at the New Palace Club Chambers in King Street , St. James 's , which suited them to a T. But here we are , so you 'll see for yourself . " Paul was more than ready to agree with Edge on that score ; from the moment he entered the club , he found the atmosphere of St. George 's agreeable and the companionship of his fellow chess players congenial . The informality of his first visit actually proved an advantage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation turned naturally to a variety of subjects : Mr. Morphy 's Louisiana background , which was unfamiliar but fascinating territory to his new acquaintances ; his various voyages over waters equally unfamiliarand fascinating ; his stopovers in Havana , which none of the others had visited and which seemed to them even more exotic and entrancing than New Orleans and the Mississippi River . His stature as a traveler gave him added prestige as a chess player and , to his great relief , interest centered elsewhere than on his first impressions of England . Seated in easy chairs around a coal fire , with decanters and glasses in easy reach , the members of the club surrounded their guest and made him feel that they were honored to welcome him in their midst . The conviction that no contests should be staged and no challenges issued before the morrow was so unanimous that it did not need to be put into words ; and the hour for Lord Lyttleton 's luncheon was set so convenientlylate that Edge could offer no reasonable objection to a call at the American Legation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet otherwise than pleased with his reception . Philip Dallas , the son of the Minister and also First Secretary of Lega/tion , welcomed him warmly . Of course they already had word of his coming , this amiable young man assured him , and were confidently looking to him to " twist the lion 's tail . " He must dine with them as soon and as frequently as his other commitments would allowwhat about that night for a starter ? And what would Mr. Morphy especially like to do in London , whom would he especially like to meet ? What were his major interests , other than chess ? Horse racing ? Boating ? Dancing ? The stage ? Sightseeing ? Paul was forced to interrupt the seemingly unending flow of hospitableoffers . He deeply appreciated the kindness of Mr. Dallas , but he must of course consult Lord Lyttleton before making any binding engagements . Meantime , he would be greatly obliged if Mr. Dallas would tell him where to get in touch with some friends of his who were , he felt sure , well known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their daughters , Berenice and Charmian . " Why , of course I can ! " Philip Dallas exclaimed without a moment 's hesitation . " On the rue des Saints PeresI 'm not sure of the number , but that 's not in the least necessarythe Hotel d'Ambres is all you require . Luck was certainly with them , having an establishment like that offered them , right in the heart of the Faubourg St. Germainthe most tightly guarded stronghold of the French artistocracy . Of course , when I refer to the Hotel d'Ambres , I 'm talking about a hotel particulier-a private palacenot a public hostelry , and this is said to be a perfect gem of seventeenth century architecture , with some of the finest boiseries , tapestries and Louis XIVth furniture in the Capital . But , after all , Jacques d'Ambres wo n't be needing it himself as long as he 's stationed in London as an attache of the French Embassy , and it 's quite in characterfor him to make a beau geste , especially where lovely ladies are concerned . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean to tell me the Sheppards are in Paris ? " " Why yes , my dear fellow , did n't you know that ? They left immediately after the Drawing Room last week . They 'd had all of May here , as well as a good share of June ; they 'd got as much out of a London Season as they could possibly hope for , a lot more than most people would expect . So , of course , it was natural for them to get what they could out of a Paris Season before the 14th of July . And I 'll wager they 'll get a good deal , with the setting and introductions Jacques has provided for them . By the way , he 's a mighty good chap , you 'll enjoy meeting him . Just as soon as you let me know when you 're free for a meal , I 'll get in touch with him , too . Now , before you dash off to that luncheon with Lord Lyttleton , Father wants to meet you . Nonsense , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just down this corridor . I 'll go ahead to show you the way . " Edge had agreed to wait for Paul at Lowe 's , so that they could go on to St. George 's together . He sprang up , eager and smiling , as his protege entered the room ; but , even before the latter spoke , Fred realized that something untoward had already undone the good work of the convivialevening they had spent at the club . " I 'm afraid what I 'm going to tell you may disappoint you , " Paul said . " It may even be rather upsetting to you . I am sorry if it is , but I ca n't help it . I agreed to come to London for two reasons : to play chess with Staunton and to meet some friends here . I 've just learned that my friends have already left for Paris . Of course , I still want to play with Stauntonthat is , if he does n't stall . From the hint you dropped yesterdayand from some stray remarks I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he does . I 'll wait a reasonable length of time , I wo n't give anyone a chance to say I have n't kept my side of the bargain . But I do n't propose to be put off indefinitely to no purpose . I intend , as soon as possible , to present myself at the Hotel d'Ambres , rue des Saints Peres , Paris . "  |p22430  , Vincent Square , Westminster , London , July 24 , 1858 . Chas . A. de Maurian , Esq . Sir , At the request of Mr. Paul Morphy , I undertake the pleasant task of informing you relative to the events which have transpired in relation to him since his arrival in England . Mr. Morphy , as you will easily understand , being so much at the mercy of this or that Knight errant desirous of breaking a lance with him , as to be precluded any chance of corresponding with his friends . And I think , too , that the eternal fitness of things ' would demand that Achilles should not be his own Homer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August has given your compatriot the advantage of measuring swords with a number of our leading amateurs . On his arrival in London , Morphy immediately sought out the St. George 's members showing extreme desire to test his skill . The fatigues of an Atlantic voyage had , however , told somewhat upon him , and although he vanquished every successive opponent , it was not , at first , in that startling proportion which he has since realized . Up to the present moment , he has played nineteen games with Mr. Barnes of which the latter scored six to Morphy 's thirteen , but the final eight were gained , one after the other by the last named gentleman , proving conclusively a certain superiority . Mr. Boden who ranks among the ten principal European players , has tested his powers nine times . winning one , drawing three and losing five . The Rev. John Owen , whose nom de guerre is Alter , ' won the first game through Morphy 's carelessness , but lost the following four ; his opponent assuring me that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of almost equal ability have bit the dust , ' and I beg to refer you to the Postscriptum for a correct list of the casualties . Boden enjoyed the reputation of being the leading player at the Grand Chess Divan in the Strand , perhaps the greatest Chess Forum in the world , where still linger the memories of Kieseritzky , Anderssen , Heyderbrandt and others . Boden , then in all the pride of ambition , replied with Mephistophelian sneer that Morphy would soon find his match . ' The first two games between them came off at the Divan , relinquished afterwards for a private room , the former gentleman not wishing to peril his reputation further , as the result was Morphy 1 , drawn 1 , Boden 0 , and as he expressed himself as highly disgustedat the score becoming public , as he purposely played private to obviatepublicity . A prominent member of the St. George 's Club stated a few days ago that he could not have believed that any man could beat Boden in such proportion ; to which observation he saw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may very properly be quoted . Morphy crossed the ocean , and threw down his gauntlet in the very sanctumof his adversarythe den of the dragonthe St. George 's Club . No way now for Staunton to refuse . Accept he must , but play , will he ? And men are now betting odds of 5 to 4 at the St. George 's , the London and the Divan , that Staunton will find some pretext for not playing . He does not like thep225present appearance of things , for during the past fortnight although Morphy has been playing right and left , with men of all shades of strength , he has not lost a game , more especially in view of the match now progressing between Morphy and Lowenthal . Lowenthal was the proposer of this match , which was offered by him in the most friendly spirit , with an eye , also to wiping out his former defeat by a boy of thirteen years old , which , you of course , remember . The game was well played on both sides . The first game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won by Morphy . The fourth was one of our hero 's happiest efforts ; from the first to last Lowenthal never had a chance , and he resigned after two hours and a quarter play at the thirty-first move . Lowenthal has acted throughout , Morphy states , in the most friendly manner . Morphy 's scores with leading players here , in off hand games , stand as follows : ( Staunton will not publish them in the I. L. N. they being too much in Morphy 's favour . ) Morphy 13 Barnes 6 Drawn 0Morphy 5 Boden 1 Drawn 3Morphy 4 Owen 1 Drawn 0Morphy 6 Lowenthal 0 Drawn 0Morphy 2 Hampton 0 Drawn 0I promise you , Sir , that during Morphy 's stay in Europe you shall be kept perfectly au courant of his battles , etc . I beg to remain , Sir , Yours very respectfully , Fred B. Edge . Edge had been so engrossed in the composition of this letter that he had not even heard Paul enter the room . Now , after signing his name with a flourish and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his friend was seated beside him , also holding a letter in his hand . " Why , hello ! " he said . " You 're just in time to see what I 've written your friend de Maurian . If there 's anything you want to add or change , you can write a postscript . " He handed the sheets to Paul , who read through the text attentively and then handed them back , shaking his head . " No , " he said . " There 's nothing I want to change or addas far as Charles is concerned . He 'll be very pleased with the picture you presented and I do n't want to cause him any unnecessary anxiety . But perhaps I 'd better show you a letter I 've written myself , before I sendit . The missive which Paul in turn handed over for inspection coveredonly part of a single sheet . Howard Staunton , Esq . ( Edge read . ) As we are now approaching the Birmingham meeting , at the termination of which you have fixed our matchp226to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preliminaries during this week . Would you be good enough to state some early period when your seconds can meet mine , so that a contest which I have so much at heart , and which from your eminent position excites so much interest in the chess world , may be looked upon as a fail accompli ? I am , dear sir , Yours very respectfully , Paul Morphy . Edge was the one who now shook his head . " I 'm sorry that you felt you had to write . But I 'm not surprised . Whenever you 've spoken to Stauntonand Lord knows you 've had plenty of chances to do that , meeting as often as you havehe 's put you off . I do n't wonder you felt the only way to pin him down was to get something on paper . And I do n't wonder you 're hurt , either . " " I 'm not hurt , exactly . But I 'm puzzledfor all sorts of reasons . At first , Staunton declined to play with me because it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that was easy enough to understand and even if it had been convenient , no one should have expected a mature professional man to leave his home and his work and cross the ocean to play with a boy he 'd hardly heard of . He never should have been asked to do soit was a presumptuous proposal , as I have n't hesitated to tell my friends who made it . I 'm not surprised he resented it . But I 've tried to make an amende honorable . I 've shown him I realized it was fitting that Mahomet should go to the mountain , not the other way around . I 've been courteous . I 've been patient . I have n't hurried him or harried him . I 've proved through my games with others that I know how to play , that he would n't be demeaning himself by taking me for an antagonist . " " I 'm afraid that 's just the trouble . I 'm afraid you 've won too many games while you 've been waiting around . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? That he wo n't risk losing his title ? " " Well , it looks rather that way , does n't it ? A champion does n't need to beg for some weeks of preparation ' the way Staunton has . He does n't need to talk about the pressures of professional commitments along other lines . He has too much self-confidence for that . He 's eager to prove his prowess , the way you are . " " It 's not so much that I 'm eager to prove my prowess . It 's that I came to England on purpose to play with Staunton , not with all the famous B 's , ' not even with Lowenthal , though nothing could have been more pleasing to me than to meet him again . I do n't like to leave any/thing undone that I 've started out to do . However , as I 've told you before " " Yes , as you 've told me before , you had a second purpose in coming to London and you 've found that the only way you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have been patient , you have been courteous . But ca n't you go on being patient and courteous just a little longer ? As an Englishman , I do n't want to have you thwarted in both the projects for which you came to London . Let 's see what Staunton says in answer to that letter . " All that Staunton said in answer to the letter was a repetition : he would like a few more weeks to prepare . A second communication from Paul , offering to leave the terms of the contest entirely to Staunton , was still unanswered when the tournament at Birmingham began . And Paul 's bewilderment was considerably increased when he received a telegram from Mr. Avery asking him to take the first train from London : Mr. Staunton was already there , the Committee was eagerly awaiting the arrival of Mr. Morphy before making the final plans for the contest . This time , when Paul sought out his friend , he was almost speechless with rage . Staunton had declared , unequivocally beforehand , that he would play nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his intention of competing in the tournament . " And if he thinks this is the way he can force my hand , he 's mistaken ! " Paul shouted . Edge had never heard him raise his voice but once beforein his moment of supreme excitement at the New York Chess Congress . " I agreed not to play because that was his agreement ! I 'm not going back on mine ! " " You do n't mean you 'll refuse to go to Birmingham ! " " No , I wont refuse to go to Birmingham . I 've promised to give a blindfold display there on the twenty-seventh and I keep my promises ! But I sha n't be there when the meeting opens on the twenty-fourth . And if the tie in which I 'm drawn for the first round goes by default to my opponent , I sha n't dispute the verdict ! " It was impossible to calm him and , after a few minutes , Edge gave up trying to do so . He was still in a state of feverish excitement when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night at the Station Hotel . When they met the next morning for breakfast , they were hardly seated when Paul made an electrifying announcement . " You 've probably heard that there 's going to be a public soiree tonight . I 'm going to fling a question at Mr. Howard Staunton in a voice loud enough for everyone to hear . Before all present , I 'm going to ask him to fix his date or , if he wo n't , why not . "  | " Paul , you wouldn'tyou could n't be guilty of such a gaucherie . It would counteract everything you 've done so far . Everything that has won you so much admiration and respect ! " " I do n't care . I 've stood all I can from Staunton . The time comes when you have to speak to men who are beneath your contempt in their own language , if you speak to them at all . That 's when you 've made the sad discovery that they do n't understand anything else . " " Then it 's better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ordinarily , I 'd agree with you . This is an extraordinary occasion ! " He pushed away his plate with even more visible distaste than usual for an English breakfast and did not even pretend to drink his " good strong India tea . " Edge , in a last desperate effort to calm him , suggested that they should take a quiet stroll through the courtyard of Queen 's College . " Why not ? I do n't give my exhibition until this afternoon . It might be a good way to pass the time . " Neither had any idea , in accepting it as such and nothing more , that Caissa , the patron deity of chess , was at last playing into their hands . They had hardly entered the tranquil enclosure when they caught sight of a group advancing from the further end . It was led by Lord Lyttleton and at his side was Mr. Howard Staunton . Mr. Avery followed with several other gentlemen . Paul glanced swiftly in their direction and quickened his pace . Lord Lyttleton , as usual , greeted him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked around Morphy , could not avoid meeting him head on . Thus confronted , as Paul afterward said contemptuously , " His gambit was not good . " " I regret that I 've not been able to find a favorable occasion to answer your latest letter , Mr. Morphy , " he said rather haltingly . " I am sure you must recognize at least some of the reasons for my hesitation to give a definite reply to your request that I would set a definite date for our contest . " And , as Paul bowed without replying , and all the others were obviously waiting attentively for Staunton 's next words , he went on still more haltingly , " You see , I 'm entirely out of play . " " I can not believe that you are not still the world 's champion , howeverout of play you may be , " Paul said icily , bowing again . " Yes , but I 'm engaged in a very important literary work . I am under bond to my publishers , who are pressing me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pressure , " Paul , who had heard all this many times before , said still more icily . " Perhaps by October you will have been released from some of the strain under which you are now laboring. "  | " I really can not say . We are already almost at the end of August and " " November then ? Or December ? " The surrounding silence had become oppressive ; courtesy compelled Staunton to put an end to it . Besides , he did not like the way Avery was looking at him , still less the way Lyttleton avoided doing so . " Well , Mr. Morphy , " he began and stopped . But there was no help for it now , he would have to go on . " Well , Mr. Morphy , " he said a second time , " if you will consent to the postponement , I will play you at the beginning of November . " " Choose your own time , by all means . As I have said , I do not wish to add to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now you have convinced me you need that . But whatever arrangements you make , please let them be final . " " Yes , of course . I will see my publishers and let you know the exact date within a few days . " Once more Paul bowed . Then he stepped aside , permitting the group he had confronted to advance . He did not move again until they were out of sight and hearing . Afterward , he turned to Edge and laughed . " This afternoon , I will give my blindfold exhibition , " he said . " This evening I will go to the public soireenot to make a scene , but to re-ceivecongratulations . Tomorrow we will return to London and start packing . The next day we will spend making farewell visits to everyone who has been so kind to us . And the day after that we will be on ourway to Paris , where we will remain until early November . " The blindfold exhibition was a brilliant performance before a brilliant gathering , the congratulations with which Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left for London in high spirits and the news that Lowenthal had defeated Staunton at the tournament , bya score of two to zero , which reached him a few days later , was not calculated to lower these . Edge was afraid that a paragraph , appearing in the form of an answer to an imaginary correspondent , in Staunton 's Illustrated London News , might have that effect , but judged it wiser to show this to his friend himself , rather than let Paul discover it or hear it from some outside source . Nevertheless , it was with many misgivings that he handed over the paper . " As you surmise , knowing the authority , ' the slang of the sporting paper in question regarding the proposed encounter between Mr. Stauntonand the young American is bunkum . ' In matches of importance it is the invariable practice in this country , before anything definite issettled , for each party to be provided with representatives to arrange 230 The Chess Playersthe terms and money for the stakes . Mr. Morphy has come here unfurnishedin both respects ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , it is clearly impossible , until they are , that any determinate arrangement can be made . 2 . The statement of another contemporary that the reduction in the amount of stakes from 1000 a side to 500 was made at the suggestion of the English amateur is equally devoid of truth ; the proposal to reduce the amount having been made by Mr. Morphy . " " I hope you 'll ask for an immediate retraction of those unblushing misstatements , " Edge said hotly , as Paul contemptuously tossed the paper aside . " Why , without mentioning Englishmen , of whom there are plenty , I 'll take my oath that there are any number of Americans in both London and Paris who would assert you could be backed against Staunton for ten thousand pounds and that the money could be raised within twenty-four hours ! " " I do n't doubt that you 're right . And since that 's so , why do we need to bother with an answer ? Besides , when a man resorts to such measures as these , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The best thing to do is to let him go on and do it . " It was in this nonchalant mood that Paul continued his packing.  |p233Des|pite  his many triumphs and the kindness and courtesy with which he had been treated during his two months ' stay in England , Paul was still smarting with resentment against Staunton when he finally set out for France . Nothing about the trip was calculated to raise his spirits . Edge , who by this time had become his alter ego , did not succeed in rousing him until it was too late for them to catch the morning train ; hence , since their belongings were already packed , they strolled about aimlessly until early afternoon and finally reached Dover in time to take an evening boat . But when they landed at Calais , they found they could not get to Paris that night . Paul had been dreadfully seasick duringthe crossing , and his initial experience on French soil was unfortunate : he spoke the language so fluently and with such a complete absence of accent , that the landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , entitled to the passport which he presented for examination . Not until he had given them a summary of the settlement , manners and customs of Louisiana did they consent , after much shrugging of shoulders , outspreading of hands , and whispered consultationamong themselves , to return his papier regle to him . Even so , the price of this release was the confiscation of most of his underlinen , a procedure which the officials assured him " was customary . " Having made their escape from the customs house , the two young men started out to the Hotel Dessin , secured rooms for the night and , after dinner , went for a stroll , which instead of refreshing them , depressedthem still further . Cynically , they agreed that Calais might have been a magnificent town " before the discovery of architecture , " but if William the Conqueror were to revisit it , he would find it unchanged , except that it was now dirtier than it could have been in his day ! Their general malaise at least had the effect of serving as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible , and they did not miss their morning train a second time . At quarter before eight , they were on one of the dingy cars which , with frequent stops , crawled along for ten hours before it reached Paris . Again , at the Gare du Nord , an inspection of baggage took place ; but fortunately , this time , Paul 's French aroused no suspicions and his remaining underwear was not claimed as a forfeit . He and Edge were released without argument and were free to take a fiacre to the Meurice . The very sight of the brilliant streets and the luxurious apartments of the beautiful hotel acted as a stimulant ; and after an excellent dinnerp234at the Restaurant des Trois Freres Provenceaux , Paul needed no urging from Edge , who already knew Paris well , to win his consent for another stroll . They ambled down the Palais Royale and past the Theatre Francaisand , as they went along , Edge gave no indication that he had any special goal in view ; but when they reached the Cafe de la @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pushed open the wide door and motioned toward the interior . This was so dense with tobacco smoke that , at first , it was almost impossible to form a definite idea of its size , style or occupants . But through the haze , they managed to make out the massive figure of the patron , Pierre Morel , who was colloquially and affectionately known as the Rhinoceros . He acknowledged their presence without animosity , but also without either curiosity or enthusiasm . As far as he was concerned , they were just two more customers ; Paul had emphatically said that he did not wish to announce his arrival in Paris until the next day , and Edge had respected his wishes to this extent , without being able to resist the temptation of showing him the place which had been designatedas the scene for his future triumphs . When their eyes became more accustomed to the clouded atmosphere , they were able to see that they were in a large room filled with tables placed so close together that passage among these was difficult ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards , dominoes and chess were in full progress . This room led into another which was much more ornate ; its massive ceiling was decorated in the cornices with shields , three of them bearing the names of Philidor , Deschappelles and Labourdonnaisthe most celebrated frequenters of the cafe . A fourth shield bore only the foundation date , with space for the name of some future customer , deserving of special tribute . Here the air was not so heavy , for smoking was forbidden ; but there was no lessening of noise around the two billiard tables , encircled by additional groups of card and chess players . In both rooms , the hubbub was so great as to make anyone , not an habitue , wonder how the concentration required for a serious match could be possible . The variety of strange tonguesGerman , Swedish , Italian , Greek , Russian created a veritable babel ; and the classes of society represented were as manifold as the languages . The military ranged in rank from private to colonel ; the clerical from shabby cures to stately monsignori @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Italians gave an effect of quarreling while they talked , the Swedes one of calm detachment ; and here and there , among the gamesters , a man sat by himself , with a cup of coffee in front of him , quietly reading from a newspaperprinted in some language which bore no resemblance to those in ordinary European use.  |p235Paul  , at first slightly displeased at having been ushered , without warning , into the place which he had had no intention of visiting until the next day , found himself drawn , against his will , toward a group clustering around two men whose absorption in their game of chess was so complete that they seemed oblivious of their surroundings . Their skill was of no mean order ; fascinated , Paul began to watch them , unconsciousof the passage of time , but finding it difficult to maintain complete silence ; every now and then a play which was either advantageous or disastrous seemed to him so inevitable that some kind of an admonitionwas indicated . But , like the other observers , he managed to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cashier , the only woman in the room ; could this dame de comptoir tell him the names of those two experts , he asked . One of them was a M. Journoud , " un de nos plus forts , " she told him ; she did not know the other . Many strangers came there . In fact , they were expecting an American , a M. Morphy . Their client , M. Arnous de Riviere , had just received a letter , saying that this celebrity was about to leave London for Paris and Herr Harrwitz , a Prussian , who was presently in Valenciennes , would be returning the latter part of the week in order to meet him .. . . The game between M. Journoud and the stranger had ended in a draw and the crowd around them was breaking up . Paul looked around for Edge and it was a minute or two before he succeeded in locating his friend . Then he spoke with some impatience . " You know I did n't intend to come here until tomorrow . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't you want to come upstairs and see the private quarters of the Cercle des Echecs ? That 's were you 'll be playing , unless you 'd rather stay in this mob . " " I do n't intend to play anywhere tonight and I 've seen as much of this place as I want to , for the moment . Do you mind if I call a fiacre and leave you ? I 'd like to pay a rather private visit . " " Do n't be so bashful about it . That 's what every young man wants to do when he first gets to Parisand as long as he stays here . " " We 're not talking about the same thing , " Paul said coldly . " If what you have in mind attracts you , please do n't let me interfere . I 'm going to pay my respects to Mrs. Albert Sheppard and her daughters . Suppose we do n't try to make connections again until tomorrow morning . " It was a beautiful balmy night , with bright stars shining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly over a great expanse of clear sapphire sky . Open air cafes , where rubicundwaiters bustled back and forth with their trays , were doing ap236thriving business ; and the streets were still thronged with pedestrians . Paul had been fortunate enough to secure an open victoria , instead of a closed hack , and , consequently , could look about him in every directionand savor all he saw to the full . The vehicle was shabby , the horse which drew it skinny , and the driver , who kept muttering unintelligibly beneath his breath , so seedily clad as to emphasize his obvious lack of prosperity . But if his conveyance had been a golden coach , drawn by superb snow-white steeds , and driven by a functionary in elegant livery , Paul 's sense of enchantment could have been no greater . As the victoria rumbled over the cobblestones on its leisurely progress toward the Faubourg St. Germain , the cafes became less numerous and the crowds began to thin . A quiet , not unlike that of the countryside , pervaded these secluded streets ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the one on the rue des Saints Peres at which the driver finally drew up behind an elegant , if somewhat somber , private carriage which was already stationed there . As Paul descended from his creaking old vehicle , telling the cocher to wait for him , the outer door , which led to a vast courtyard , was opened by a concierge and a tall , bearded man , wearing the ribbon of the Legion of Honor and carrying one of those black bags which , all over the world , signify that their possessor is a physician , came slowly forward from the direction of the monumental building beyond . " Good evening , M. le docteur , " Paul said , stepping inside the court , despite the sputtered protests of the concierge , who tried to block his passage . " I 'm an old friend of the Sheppards ' , Paul Morphy of New Orleans . Is it indiscreet to ask if one of the ladies is ill ? " The doctor set down his bag and extended his hand . " M. Morphy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much excitement ? " And , in an aside to the still protesting concierge , he muttered , " Taisez vous . Ce monsieur est ami de la maison . " " I do play chess . I do n't know about the excitement , " Paul replied , grateful for the prompt intervention and acceptance . " But wo n't you please tell me . . . it 's rather late to be making a professional call , unless there 's an emergency . " " Or a social one , either , is n't it ? " the doctor inquired with a smile which did much to relieve Paul 's anxiety . " But I can understand your concern . The young ladies , I am glad to say , are in blooming health . But Mme Sheppard grows frailer all the time and she suffers increasingly from attacks of faintness , one of which was the cause of my presence here tonight . It is impossible to tell , until such an attack has passed , whether it was merely the result of undue fatigue , emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have found no indicationsp237pointing to a present cardiac disturbance ; but I should not have been able to enjoy untroubled rest later on if I had not come when I was called . Madame 's circulation is poor at best ; she was chilly , even on such a fine evening as this ; but when the really severe weather sets in , her condition is bound to cause me grave concern , unless there is a great improvement , which alas ! I can not foresee . She should arrange to leave Paris and go to the Riviera or else return to your New Orleans which , I understand , has a delightful climate . " " And she does n't want to ? " The doctor shrugged slightly . " I think it is really a matter of indifference to her . She has developed a certain lassitude , an unwillingness to make decisions , especially if they involve moving about . But she has come to have confidence in my treatment of her and , naturally , I must confine my practice to Paris . Undoubtedly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasantly settled here , as you will see when you go in . " " Then it is all right for me to go in ? " " Indeed , yes . I hope you did not take my little jest about a social call too seriously . I have given Mme Sheppard a soothing draught , so perhaps it would be better if you did not disturb her tonight . Her elder daughter , Mlle Berenice , is sitting with her and will continue to do so until she is really asleep . But her husband is in town just now and he and Mlle Charmian are in the salon . I have just left them there . Go in , by all means . I am sure they will be delighted to see you . As I am , to have met you . " With a courtly bow and a second word of admonition to the concierge , the doctor passed through the great outer door . Paul saw him walk toward the waiting carriage before he was swallowed up in the dimness of the street . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shake his head and look at Paul suspiciously , he did not try to stop the visitor 's rapid progress across the huge paved court , bare except for the low stone posts , looped together by iron chains , which flanked it on either side . Paul was accustomed to large houses built flush to the street , with a patio in the rear , to which a driveway usually led direct ; but he had never previously been to one with such a grim and guarded approach . However , the facade which he now faced , though its dimensions were imposing , was less formidable in character than the courtyard ; green shutters brightened its dun-colored walls , twin lanternsshone on either side of the entrance and the demilune , by which this was approached , harmonized with its general pattern . Paul needed no second bidding to run up the steps and ring the bell . There was a slight delay about admitting him and he chafed with impatience . Thoughp238he could not see them , because of the drawn curtains , he could hear Charmian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should be made to wait before he was permitted to join them . When the door was finally opened by a manservant , whose startled manner and rumpled uniform both suggested that he had not expected to be summonedagain , once the doctor had left , Paul spoke loudly enough to make certain that he would be overheard . " I am M. Morphy of New Orleans . M. le docteur , whom I met , just as he was leaving , assured me that Mlle Charmian and M. Sheppard would be glad to see me . " The words were not out of his mouth before father and daughter appeared in the wide doorway , leading from the drawing room to the front hall , and brushed aside the hesitant servant . Mr. Sheppard wrung his hand warmly and Charmian , without abashment , threw her arms around his neck . " Come in , come in ! Glad to see you ! Of course , we 're delighted ! But we really did n't expect you until tomorrow . " " I 'm not supposed to be here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the first time , tomorrow noon . But I purposely came a day early , to have an eveningor at least part of an eveningto myself . As a matter of fact , I 'd have been here yesterday if we had n't missed the morning train from London and been obliged to spend the night in Calaisa dismal place , if I ever saw one ! Then Fred Edge , who 's still with me , played a trick on me ; he suggested an after-dinner stroll and , the next thing I knew , he was pushing me inside the Cafe de la Regence . But at least he had the decency not to give me away and I escaped withoutbeing recognized . So of course I came straight here . " " Of course ! Come in and sit down . My Missus is a little under the weather and Berenice is staying with her . But I think Berenice will be down in a few minutes . Meanwhile " He looked from Paul to Charmianand laughed . " Meanwhile , I guess you two would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Missus myself . " " I 'm terribly sorry to hear Mrs. Sheppard is n't well . But if you 're sure my visit is n't inopportune " " Does n't look that way to me , " Mr. Sheppard said , laughing again . Charmian had now taken Paul 's arm and , while her father was talking , made small cooing sounds of pleasure . " Then I wonder . . . . I kept my cab , a victoria . It 's such a lovely night , perhaps you 'd let Charmian come for a little ride with me , sir . " " Let Charmian ! I like that ! What do you think he is ? A sort of jailer ? " " You see , " Mr. Sheppard said genially . It was obvious that he wasp239in a very good mood , much better than Paul would have expected on the part of a man whose wife had been sufficiently ill to indicate that a physician should be summoned late in the evening . " No monkey business , though . Paris is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pretty shrewd about spotting runaways and pretty stern in dealing with them . " " I assure you , sir " " Oh , Paul , ca n't you ever take a joke ? Come , let 's go ! I do n't even need a hat , do I ? " Paul had really hoped to catch a glimpse of Berenice , whom he liked very much and , since Mr. Sheppard had said she would " be down in a few minutes , " it was on the tip of the visitor 's tongue to suggest that the excursion be delayed that long , even though he had been the one to propose it . But both Mr. Sheppard 's joviality which , Paul suspected , might be partly due to the amount of excellent wine he had consumed with the evening meal , and Charmian 's unconcealed eagerness to be off , deterred him from making such a suggestion . He shook hands with Mr. Sheppard again and kept abreast of Charmian as she ran quickly down the steps and across the court . She paused long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who now looked more surly than ever . But she had leaped lightly into the victoria before Paul could proffer his help . " I have to sit on your right , " she told him . " Otherwise , everyone who sees us out together will think I 'm a naturally naughty girl and that you want to let people know you think so , too . You do n't , do you ? You do n't want other people to think so , either , I 'm sure . " " You know I think you 're the loveliest , sweetest , purest girl in the whole world ! You know I 'd kill anyone who had the indecency to so much as hint otherwise . " " What are you talking about ? You would n't kill a fly ! " " Yes I would if " " Well , do n't let 's talk about killing ! Let 's tell the cocher where to go and then settle back for a nice quiet visit with lots of kisses . " " In an open victoria ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris , if they want to , even if it is n't any Gretna Green . . . . Have you been to the Bois de Boulogne yet ? " " I have n't been anywhere except from the Gare du Nord to the Meurice to leave my bags and to the Restaurant des Trois Freres Provenceaux to eat my dinner , and down the street to the Cafe de la Regence where I found myself , as I told you , before I had any idea that was where we were headed . Then I came straight to see you . "  | " Which , of course , is what you should have done . Now say , Cocher , Bois de Boulogne , et allez doucement . ' Then you wo n't need to speak to him again for hours . And , of course , we can put up the top of the victoria , if you want to . But it 's pretty dark in the Bois anyway . " He had been completely unconscious of the flight of time , Paul told himself honestly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he started to wind it , when he was back in his room at the Meurice and saw that the hands were pointing to four o'clock . It was unforgivable that he should have kept Charmian out so long , especially when her mother was ill , that he should have been so late in taking her home that Berenice had long since gone to bed , that only Mr. Sheppard , who gave every indication of having been napping , between brandies , should have good-naturedly waited up for them and said , with a yawn , " Well , I guess boys will be boys and girls will be girls . " It was incomprehensible that Paul should have forgotten the real reason why he had come to Paristo play chess with a formidable antagonist , whom it would requireall his skill to defeat . He should have gone to bed early , he should have had a long night 's rest ; above all , he should have avoided anything that would be emotionally stirring . And instead , he had spent hours riding about a city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really slept ! was certainly somnolent , at least in the parts where he had gone in the shabby victoria , with his arm around Charmian'sslim yielding waist , and her shining head on his shoulder , except when she raised her lips to meet his . . . . He undressed and lay down on his bed . But he was too overwrought for sleep . He told himself he must regain his composure , he must stop thinking about Charmian and yearning for her and remember only his obligations to the sponsors who looked confidently forward to his meeting with Harrwitz . But how could he ? How could any man , who had spent hours with his beloved after a long separation from her , think of anyone or anything else ? At noon , as agreed , he met Daniel Harrwitza small man with a well-developed head and large piercing black eyesat the Cafe de la Regence . For the first time , in his long succession of triumphs , Paul lost the game.  |p242Admittedly  , the circumstances under which the game was played were unfavorable to Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made no effort to justify his defeat by dwelling on these . " Harrwitz won because he made the best moves , " he insisted when Edge began to murmur . " Tu sais , je ne suis pas homme aux excuses . " He was fond of describing himself in this way when other chess players pleaded illness , lack of preparation , strange surroundings or the burdens of professional duties as alibis for inferior play ; and his recent experience with Staunton had made him doubly averse to changing his own attitude . Besides , next to Staunton , there was no antagonist he was as eager to engage as Harrwitz . This Prussian had literally given himself up , body and soul , to chess . He rose early in the morning , went directly to the Cafe de la Regence , and remained there , playing steadily except for the brief intermission when he dineduntil late in the evening . He followed this schedule with absorption day after day , whereas all others regarded as past masters of the game had supplementaryinterests and varied pursuits : St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editor and an analyst ; Anderssen a professor of mathematics ; Heyderbrandt a diplomat and Lowe a hotelkeeper . True , Staunton had once been as constant in his attendance at the London Divan as Harrwitz now was at the Cafe de la Regence and had become so rabid on the subject of chess that he actually caused the bosoms and tails of his shirts to be printed with kings , rooks and pawns ; but that was before literary pursuits had begun to divert him . There was no possible chance , as far as Paul could see , that Harrwitz could or would find the same excuses as Staunton or invent others . If he , Paul , could beat Harrwitz , he would , in truth , be the chess champion of the world . When his antagonist , delighted with the results of the first game , shook hands with him as they bade each other good-bye , displaying even more cordiality than when they had greeted each other a few hours earlier , and said they had better settle the preliminaries of the match the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meantime , " Edge said as he and his protege walked back to the Meurice , " you 'll go to bed at once and get a good long sleep . " " I 'm sorry to disappoint you . I have an engagement for this evening . " " This evening ! Why man , there 's no evening left , even by Continental standards ! It 's night already . "  | " Very well , I wo n't argue about phraseology . The point is I want to change my clothes . They 're saturated with the smell of smoke . That 's why I 'm returning to the Meurice . But I 'm going straight out again . " " Paul , if you stay out most of the night a second time , the same thing will happen tomorrow that happened today . " " All right then , it will . I 'm sure you find this hard to believe , but there are some things that matter to me more than chess . " Again , as when he had been confronted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived in England , Edge found that argument was unavailing ; and once more it was four o'clock in the morning before the truant returned to the hotel . However , he was ready and waiting for Harrwitz when the Prussian appeared at the Cafe de la Regence shortly after noon . This time Harrwitz , though he had insisted on playing in one of the large public rooms the day before , willingly adjourned to a private parlor ; but , upon arrival there , he began to impose conditions for the match rather than to discuss these . There must be no seconds , he said , and no umpires . Paul , who had not foreseen such a restriction , had already asked two outstanding players from the enemies ' camp , De Riviere and Journoud , to act in the former capacity ; he was distressed and embarrassed at the idea of withdrawing his invitation ; and , though their courteous and understanding attitude did something to assuage his feelings , he could see that these were shared by a newcomer on the scene : Eugene Lequesne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing as a chess player . Harrwitz was not popular at the Regence ; in fact , many of its habitues had declinedto play with him , because of his offensive manners , and he had more than once been obliged to accept a casual visitor to the cafe as an opponent , because no one else would put up with his insolence . Now , as he delivered his ultimatum , Lequesne glanced anxiously at the outsider ; but Paul , despite his chagrin , managed to answer tranquilly . " I am sorry I did not realize earlier that Herr Harrwitz objected to seconds . But the mistake is mine . I should have acquainted myself better with his habits of play . " " Very well , " the Prussian said harshly , " before you make any more mistakes , let me acquaint you further with my habits of play , as you call themmore accurately , the conditions upon which I am willing to play with you . I shall insist that you accept all bets offered and that the winner of the first seven games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Paul said , still tranquilly . " And that we shall play only four out of every seven days every week . " " That will suit me admirably , " Paul answered , this time smilingly , asp244he began to visualize more and more leisure for visits to the Hotel d'Ambres and drives through the Bois de Boulogne . " And the match shall be played in the public part of the cafe . " This pronouncement was not so easy to meet with a smile . It had been one thing to play with a crowd of onlookers at the tournament in New York ; they were not allowed to approach the contestants and silence was strictly enforced on both groups . At the Regence , there was constant movement , noise and confusion , as in any cafe ; and , to make matters worse , Harrwitz had displayed a rollicking contempt for his antagonist throughout the first game and , at the end of it , had leaned across the table , seized Paul 's hand and , turning to the crowd , announced in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster than if he had won ! " To be sure , the public 's response to this sally had been less jovial than he had hoped ; again , his bad manners had made him offensive to the habitues of the Regence and not a few thought that Morphy would retaliate by refusing to go on with the match and that they would not blame him if he did . Lequesne now felt the same way ; although this was his first meeting with Morphy , he had been quick to admire and recognize the other 's sensitivity . He was relieved when he heard Paul say , a second time , " Very well , " as quietly as he had the first , and add , " Shall we start right away ? " " Why not , now that everything is amicably settled ? " Harrwitz responded . He led the way back to the large smoke-filled main room , selected a table without consulting Paul 's choice in the matter and made his first move belligerently . Paul was by this time so weary and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Temporarily , he had forgotten that a victory over Harrwitz represented his supreme ambition . He played not only inattentively but carelessly , while Harrwitz smiled sardonically , rolled about in his seat and addressed bystanders in loud and boastful tones . While he did not actually say , " You see ? It takes very little trouble to beat this poor young fellow ! " the inference was plain and , unfortunately , it was based on fact . For the second time , he was an easy winner . " Two down and five to go ! " he shouted , rising and pushing back his chair . " Yes , five to go , Herr Harrwitz , " Paul answered , gathering up the chessmen . He still spoke quietly , but there was a different quality in his voice . It was not dull with fatigue , like the infrequent comments he had made during the last few hours ; it was steady and purposeful again . He was245aware , despite the restrained courtesy of the crowd in the face of the Prussian 's boorishness , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but , no longer indifferent , he was determined to regain it . He remained where he was for a few minutes , chatting with Lequesne , De Riviere and Journoud ; then he bade them good night , said that this time he would follow his mentor 's advice about a long sleep , and linked his arm through Fred 's as they went out of the door . " Those chaps will be surprised , wo n't they , " he said , " when Harrwitzstarts to loseand continues to lose from now on ? " Paul was a good prophet . Harrwitz did not win again . During the third and fourth games , Paul scored beautifully , and without hesitation or excitement . At the end of each , he was showered with congratulationsfrom the same persons who , such a short time before , had looked so woefully crestfallen . When he won the fifth game , Harrwitz , whose conduct had become less belligerent , was plainly uncomfortable . In an aside to an acquaintance , he confessed that Morphy was proving stronger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter , asking for an " intermission " ; Mr. Harrwitz , it appeared , was in " ill health . " Paul laughed as he turned the missive over to Edge . " What are you going to say in reply ? " Fred asked with interest . " Oh , with many expressions of sympathy for his indisposition , I 'll suggest a respite of ten days or so . But I think I 'll also suggest that when we start playing again , we do so daily , with the exception of Sunday . Meanwhile , I 'm not sorry , you know , to have ten days free . " From the beginning , Paul had made no mystery of his visits to the Hotel d'Ambres and , though Fred had at first protested against these , because he saw in them a menace to Paul 's prowess at chess , his disapprovalhad gradually become less outspoken and , as a matter of fact , less intense . When Paul lost the second game with Harrwitz , Fred had referred so angrily to the subject that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed to go to the opera with him that evening , instead of rushing off once again to the rue des Saints Peres , he had been somewhat appeased . Paul had not thought it necessary to inform his friend that this change of program did not indicate a corresponding change of heart . Charmian had a previous engagement which she either could not or would not break and , after two rapturous midnight drives through the Bois and the promise of more , Paul had realized that it would be unwise to say or do anything which might cause her to resent a protest on his part . As a matter of fact , if he were not to be with her in a delicious solitude a deux , there was nothing which could possibly have given him more pleasure than attending an operatic performance.  |p246He  had inherited his mother 's love for music and might even have excelled her in ability along those lines if he had put as much time and effort into it as she had . Edge , who had not been previously aware of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had acquired , not only while sitting in a loge grillee at the Orleans Theatre , but also during the course of the soirees held in the Morphys ' drawing room . He listened with respectful attention while his friend informed him that Madame Morphy was herself composing an opera which she had tentatively entitled Lorraine , which was still unfinished , but of which they had great hopes ; and then went on to analyze , in critical detail , such great works as William Tell , Il Trovatore and Les Huguenots . La Part du Diable , the production of the present evening , was , of course , rather trivial by comparison ; but it served well enough for a pastime , if nothing better offered . . . . Nothing better offered , as far as Charmian was concerned , for the following evening , either ; and again Edge was delighted with Paul 's compliance , when the latter consented to accept an invitation for dinnerat the residence of a certain Monsieur Doazun , who was himself a chess expert of no mean standing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once more Paul 's compliance was based not only on a desire to please and placate his friend , but because he was in a favorable position to do so . True , Charmian had been engaged for dinner and the rest of the evening ; but she had been free earlier in the day and had suggested that he might like to have tea with her in the gardenit was really worth seeing . The bait of a garden was quite unnecessary ; tea with Charmian , no matter where it was served , would have represented to Paul an ambrosialfeast in Elysian Fields . Nevertheless , once seated at a table on a green lawn , near a fountain with a backdrop of an ivied wall and flanked by noble trees and age-old statues , he did not remain unmoved by his surroundings , much less oblivious of them . The severity of the vast entrance court at the front of the palace had left him totally unpreparedfor the gracious verdure , trickling waters and warm marbles of the grounds at the rear . Actually , it was incorrect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they comprised a series of gardens , leading from the terrace on which the doors and windows of the ground floor opened . It would have been impossible to believe , beforehand , that such stately spaciousness , combined with such quietude and such luxuriance , could prevail against the noise and crowding of a great city . Charmian had been waiting for him when he arrived , and had drawn him from the vestibule , paved in great squares of black and white marble " It looks just like a giant chessboard , does n't it ? " she hadp247asked him laughinglyinto a small drawing room for a swift embrace . The others were waiting for them in the garden , she told him ; she had n't been able to arrange , today , for them to have much time alone ; they would have to make the most of what they did have . Lacking leisure for the expression of their feelings , they achieved even greater intensity than before ; never had Paul permitted himself to clasp Charmian so closely or to kiss her so passionately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eager . Neither heard Berenice when she first called from the further end of the terrace , to tell them Papa and Mama were already waiting for them at the tea table ; she was obliged to come nearer . Inevitably , Paul realized with some confusion that she must have seen them locked in each other 's arms ; but this confusion was so permeated with ecstasy that it did not trouble him , especially as Charmianseemed quite unconcerned at the consciousness that Berenice had been a witness to their rapture . Indeed , he told himself triumphantly , this would indicate , more definitely than anything that had happened previously , that he was an accepted and , therefore , a privileged suitor . Berenice greeted him warmly but calmly , her attitude that of an affectionatesister . Surely , everything was well in the best of all possible worlds . Nevertheless , despite his conviction of this , he was momentarily shocked by the appearance of Mrs. Sheppard . She looked old enough to be the girls ' grandmother , instead of their mother , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not a ray of color in her face , which had lost most of its former beauty ; her soft skin had become a mass of wrinkles , and her once abundant golden hair was scanty and had turned snow white . Her loose dress hung in folds on her emaciated form and her heavy rings slipped about so freely on her thin fingers that Paul kept expecting them to fall off . Only her smile was as sweet as ever and her eyes as kind . " I am so glad to see you , Paul , " she said cordially . " Come and sit beside me and tell me about your triumphs . " " I have n't had any in Paris so far , Mrs. Sheppard , " he said , accepting the proffered seat . " Oh , but you will ! I do not go out in society any more , because I do not seem to be very strong , just now , and , besides , it is so pleasant here that I am more than content to remain in this lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time . But my husband and Charmian assure me that everyone regards you as the coming sensation of the season . " " Indeed they do , " Charmian agreed . " The reason I could n't ask you to dine here last night or the night before , Paul , was because we werep248going to parties both evenings , one given by the Duchesse de Trevisse and the other by the Princess Mathilde . And in both places everyone was talking about you . The Princess wants you to come to her next soiree ; she told me to invite you . I thought perhaps we could go together . She has a perfectly wonderful house on the rue de Courcelles and receives every Tuesday . You 'd like to go , would n't you ? You 'd see everyone worth knowing in Paris there . " " I see everyone I really want to see here and now , " he said , glancing happily around the table , " and I ca n't imagine a more wonderful place than this . " " That 's because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that horrible cafe . But you 'll change your mind when you see the Princess and her house . Wo n't he , Papa ? " " He might . And then again he might n't . I understand this one has some special attraction for him . " They all laughed , as if Mr. Sheppard had said something extraordinarilywitty and original . Berenice had unobtrusively taken over the task of pouring the tea , for her mother 's frail fingers were now shaking uncontrollably . But , as her family seemed to be accepting her condition without anxiety , Paul thought that perhaps it was not as serious as it seemed . She went on talking to him in her kindly way . " You must feel free to come here whenever you have leisure and inclination , Paul , " she said . " If my husband and Charmian are not at home , Berenice and I will always be glad to see you . And you have a friend with you in Paris , have n't you ? A Mr. Edge ? Next time you come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that could be a very good idea , for more reasons than one , Paul said to himself as he thanked her . Fred and Berenice might take a liking to each otherwhy not ? Fred was a personable , as well as an agreeable fellow , and Berenice could easily have passed for a beauty had it not been necessary for her to bear comparison with Charmian ; and not even Charmian had a more delightful manner or more lively intelligence . He appreciated the devotion of Berenice to her invalid mother , but he hoped this would not deprive her of the normal pleasures to which her youth entitled herpleasures such as he and Charmian enjoyed . But no , that would be too much to expect , because no one in the whole world had as much to offer a man as Charmian , no other man was as fortunate as he . He glanced across the table and caught her eye . She looked him full in the face , smiled and bit her lip ever so slightly ; he could see two white teeth resting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little before they came together again . The movement was so quick and so subtle that hep249was sure no one but himself could have noticed it , but in it he read an invitation . Before he left that afternoon , they must embrace again and when he kissed her , it must be not only passionately , but fiercely and questingly . He had not yet proved his power to wound or even bruise in the name of love and she wanted him to do so ; his essential gentleness had prevented him from realizing this . He had not yet discovered all the secret sweetness of that beautiful red mouth ; his essential reserve had prevented him from seeking it ... . He was not sure whether or not he should give her a signal that he had understood . But the sudden temptation to do so was so strong that he could not resist it . He nodded ever so slightly , before turning away to devote his undivided attention to her mother . " Who is this Princess that Charmian is talking about ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least he must pretend interest . " Why , do n't you know ? " Charmian exclaimed , setting down her cup . The question had not been addressed to her , but it was obvious she felt her mother unequal to answering it . " She 's the Emperor 's first cousin and a great favorite of hisin fact , when they were both very young , they were engaged , but the match was broken off for family reasons and she married a horrible Russian prince instead . Now she 's legally separated from the brute and lives her own lifea perfectly wonderful life . She 's rich , she 's beautiful , she 's the toast of Paris , she has I do n't know how many admirers at her feet . But she does n't care about any of them , except " " That 'll do , young lady . No need to try and tell Paul about the Princess all at once . Leave a little for him to find out for himself ... . How about it , Mother ? Finished your tea ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheppard had , it appeared , finished her tea and did not care for any cake . Her appetite , she told Paul apologetically , did not seem to be very hearty . And yes , her husband , who was always so thoughtful , was right ; she was beginning to notice a change in the air , now that the sun was setting . Perhaps she had better go into the house . But she hoped Paul would not hurry away on that account . And he was to remember they were expecting him back soon and that he was to bring Mr. Edge when he came the next time . She rose , gathering a shawl of lacy white wool around her and took her husband 's arm . Albert seconded his wife 's invitation and they moved slowly away in the direction of the terrace . Paul had rather expected that Berenice would go with them . Instead , she poured herself another cup of tea and helped herself to more cake . " I do n't think any of us have told you the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's really very interesting . Would n't you like to hear something about it ? " Actually , there was nothing Paul wanted less at that moment . He looked from one sister to the other and saw that Charmian was again biting her lower lip and that the expression of Berenice was inscrutable . He swallowed hard . " Yes , very much , " he said , because it was obvious he could say nothing else . " It was built by the grand aumonier of Louis XIII , but he ruined himself with its costly construction . So he was forced to rent it and Queen Christina of Sweden leased it for her Ambassador , the famous Hugo de Groot . After that , it was bought by the Duchess of Villars , who spent another fortune on it . When she died , she left it to her niece , the Marquise de Tourcelles . Eventually , just before the Revolution , it was occupied by the Marquis de Flammaran . " " You 're skipping , " Charmian interrupted . " If you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as the stupid parts ? The poor Marquise de Tourcelles never got much fun out of the place , because her mean old husband clapped her into prison and managed to keep her there . He thought she was too frivolous and flirtatious . Just the same , she loaned it to the Marquis de Cavoye , whom she liked very , very much , just as the Princess Mathilde likes Monsieur de Nieuwerkerquevery , very much , even if Papa did shut me up when I tried to tell you about him . By-and-by , this favorite gentleman of the marquisebought it . Lots of people still call it the Hotel de Cavoye , instead of the Hotel d'Ambres , though it 's been in Jacques ' family a long time now . By the way , did you meet Jacques while you were in London ? " " No , I 'm sorry to say I did n't . Philip Dallas very kindly tried to arrange it , but there never seemed to be a time when we were all free . " " Oh well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going back to London , are n't you ? " " Yes , in November . " There was a short silence . Charmian crumpled the last piece of cake to which she had helped herself and glanced first at Paul and then at Berenice . " Are n't you going on with your history lesson ? " she asked her sister . " You have n't told Paul about the boiseries yetthat those in the banquetinghall came from the Hotel de Crillon and those in the main drawing room from the Hotel Saint Senoch . I 'm sure all that would be vitally interesting to him . And do n't forget the marble mantelpieces , either , or the portrait of Villars by Tourniere or any of the rest of it . " It was impossible to escape the note of sarcasm that had crept intop251her voice . Paul tried to do so and , to his distress , found that he could not . But Berenice , if she were aware of it , seemed undisturbed by it . " Why do n't we show him these treasures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked in her calm way . " I think Papa and Mama are right , it is getting a little cool . " " I 'm not in the least cool . I think this is the pleasantest part of day in a garden . Do n't you , Paul ? " It was , undeniably , very pleasant . The shadows were beginning to lengthen under the great trees and the birds were beginning their twilight twitter ; the musical sound of the fountain 's trickling water mingled with their chirping . An early moon , still only a slender crescent , shone in a sky which had changed in color from turquoise to sapphire and its beams silvered the statues . If only he and Charmian could be alone here ... . A footman came quickly across the terrace and , approaching the table , began to gather up the tea service . As he did so , he spoke in an aside to Berenice and she rose hesitantly . " Mama has sent for me , " she said . " I 'm afraid I must go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charmian ? " " Of course I 'm sure , " Charmian said shortly . " Then we 'll see the boiseries another time , Paul . " Berenice walked slowly in the direction of the house and twice she stopped , as if still doubtful whether or not to go on . Once she turned around and waved to them . Paul waved in return , but Charmian sat stubbornly still . " Berenice is spying on us , " she said angrily . " She saw us kissing each other , before we came out . " " Yes , I believe she did . Just the same , I do n't think she was shocked . She realizes we love each other , that I want nothing in the world so much as to marry you . " " I do n't know that she was shocked . She may have been , because she 's a terrible prude . But that 's not the main reason she does n't want you to kiss me , that she was determined not to leave us . She 's jealous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Did n't it ever occur to you that she 's in love with you ? " " Of course not ! She 's fond of me in a sisterly way and I 'm very glad she is . I 'm fond of her , too , in a brotherly way . But " " But you were n't ever tempted to kiss herin a brotherly way ? " " No , of course not . I 've never been tempted to kiss anyone but you . " " Do you expect me to believe that ? " " Yes . In the first place , because it happens to be true . In the second place , because I 've told you so and I want to feel that you rely on my word . " 252 The Chess Players " All right , I believe you . And now you must believe me when I tell you something . " " What is it ? " " That you need more practice in kissing . " It was hardly a wonder that , when Paul returned to the Hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jocund companion . As they dressed for Mr. Doazun 's dinner , Paul described the gardens of the Hotel d'Ambres , repeated , parrot-like , what he had learned of its history , and informed Edge that the latter was included in the next invitation to tea . Fred was understandably pleased and flattered . He was also moved to more curiosity about the owner of the Hotel d'Ambres and the reason for its loan to the Sheppards than he had previously felt . " You say this hotel , as you call itI must say I think that 's a damn queer way to talk about a palacebelongs to the Marquis d'Ambres and that he 's loaned it to the Sheppards . How did he happen to do so ? " " I 've told you that , too . He 's an attache of the French Legation in London . He wo n't be needing it for a long time himself and , according to Phil Dallas , there 's nothing he enjoys more than making a beau geste . " " I see . . . how old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . I did n't ask . " " Is he married ? " " I did n't ask that , either . What difference does it make ? " " None , I suppose . Except that if he had a wife he might not feel so free to make a beau geste in the direction of a family with two marriageabledaughters . " " Nonsense ! He made it chiefly on Mrs. Sheppard 's account . She 's a pitiful invalid . She does n't go out at all . That beautiful garden is a godsendto her . D'Ambres must have known it would be . " " I see , " Fred remarked again . " So you 're sure he is n't sweet on either of those charming girls ? ' " No , I did n't say that . Of course he may be . I imagine a good many hopeful gentlemen are . But I am sure there was n't any bargain about this , that he was n't given any encouragement . Because neither of those charming girls is sweet , as you call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I see , " Fred remarked a third time . And the subject was not mentionedagain . As might have been expected , Mr. Doazun 's dinner was a great success.  |p254At  the end of ten days , Herr Harrwitz declared himself sufficiently well to play again and again was beaten , which left a score of Morphy four , Harrwitz two , drawn none . The Prussian immediately suffered another relapse . Paul had enjoyed every minute of the interval which had been free from chess and , to a lesser but by no means inconsiderable degree , so had Edge . Both had been frequent visitors at the Hotel d'Ambres and Edge had instantly fulfilled Paul 's hopes by losing his heart to Berenice . ? ' I Though her calm cordiality could not be interpreted as encouragement to his ardor , he admired her all the more because , as he put it , inelegantlybut effectively , it was plain to see that she was not one of those girls who would drop into your mouth like a ripe cherry . Her devotion to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from resenting the amount of time she spent with the invalid , he was convinced she would reveal the same amount of unselfishness in all her relationships . He did not complain because she did not have more leisure for visitors and almost none at all for going out ; he set this down both to her present credit and as a good omen for the future . As far as Charmian was concerned , he was quite content to leave his friend a clear field . He acknowledged and praised her beauty , but he was sincere in saying that Berenice was more his type . Paul , though puzzled by such a declaration , was so glad to take it at face value that he did not question it . Nothing , he told himself blissfully , could have been more ideal than his present position in relation to every one of the Sheppards . Berenice continued to treat him like a fondly regarded brother , Mrs. Sheppard like the son whom she had desired in vain , Mr. Sheppard like a prospective son-in-law who was wholly acceptable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of an official betrothal , Mr. Sheppard staved him off , but much less emphatically than he had the first time . Now that Paul had achieved his majority , he would , of course , be justified in feeling that his suit should not be dismissed as a boyish fancy ; he was old enough to give serious consideration to matrimony and to have such consideration treated with respect . On the other hand , he had not settled down yet , as far as either locale or profession was concerned ; he was traveling from place to place , committed to a series of chess tournaments . Once he was back in New Orleans and had begun the practice of law , they would discuss the subject of a formal engagement again , and Mr. Sheppard had no doubt that they would see eye to eyep255in the matter . Meanwhile , Charmian was getting a good deal out of her European experience , and her father thought it was better to keep to its present pattern , at least for the time being . Once she had settled down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which were educational , as well as enjoyable . Besides , Charmian was the sort of girlas Paul probably did not have to be remindedwho would need to have her fling some time and it was much better that she should do so now rather than later . Mr. Sheppard did not see that Paul would gain anything by having the engagement announced ; as far as her father could make out , Charmian was giving her suitor as many privileges as any man had a right to expect until he was actually married . It was because this was indeed the case and Paul in no position to deny it , that he did not press his point any further . Whenever he and Charmian were by themselves , she accepted and returned his embraces without hesitation . As a matter of fact , she often seemed to invite them , as she had that first day in the garden . She showed no embarrassment when they were occasionally surprised in each other 's arms , and she not infrequently took his hand in hers or leaned against his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who all seemed to take such caresses for granted . It was unimaginable to any gently bred Creole that a girl of good breeding and good character would permit , much less encourage , such liberties on the part of a man whom she did not regard as her future husband . Indeed , though the code was now somewhat less rigid than in the days of Alonzo and Telcide , Paul felt sure that his brother Edward had never been as " privileged " as he was himself , duringthe period of courtship . He might well consider himself fortunateand he did ! because of such discrepancy in customs as apparently existed between those of New England and those of the Deep South . As long as he and Charmian and all her family knew that she was his prospective bride , and he was allowed to treat her as such , what did it matter whether or not the rest of the world knew of his supreme good fortune ? It was , of course , the intervals when they were by themselves that gave him the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the small drawing room which led from the vestibule with the " chessboard " pavement , and which seemed to him an ideal mise-en-scene for love making . The grand salon beyond , with its white hoiseries , its immense crystal chandeliers , its endless expanse of polished parquetry and its stiff , scattered Louis XIV furniture , struck him as not only formal but forbidding of both aspect and atmosphere ; there was always a certain chilliness about it . But the petit salon , with its wall covering of crimson brocade , its incidental panels of green and gold ,  |p256its  jewel-toned Persian rugs , its glowing family portraits and its charming bibelots was warm and friendly and intimate . On cool daysand there were soon an increasing number of thesea fire burned under the marble mantel and , at dusk , candles flickered beneath shades of rosecoloredsilk . Only the firelight and the candlelight illumined the room ; otherwise , it was engulfed with kindly shadows . Next to the sweet privacy of the petit salon , Paul came to value the hours spent in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunny days and where the Sheppards sat at leisure with their more familiar friends . Paul and Fred quickly became part of the congenial group and , from this , their circle expanded to embrace the haut monde at whose soirees they were also welcome guests . The first invitation from the Princess Mathilde was swiftly followed by a second and a third ; but next to the Sheppards , the house that Paul was soon visiting most often was that of the Baronne de la Sange , a beautiful West Indian who insistedshe was drawn to him " because he was a lazy Creole like herself . " As a matter of fact , she had achieved almost as exalted a status as a hostess as the Princess Mathilde ; she was renowned as the patroness of the arts , and the most celebrated sculptors , painters and authors flocked to her salon every week . But there was nothing of the pedant about her ; she was witty rather than learned and possessed of such abundant health and spirits that she never showed the slightest sign of strain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amant or Lequesne at her side to stop her when she made a serious mistake , she would play game after game , meanwhile keeping the entire company in a state of merriment by her sallies ; and when she found that her fellow Creole was almost as fond of music as he was of chess , she included the principalsingers from the opera in her guest list , and even prevailed upon the famous baritone , Graziani , to play against Paul with odds of Queen . Afterward , the great singer referred to the match , in which he eventually played not only one game but three , jestingly and at the same time proudly . " I am accused of not taking my lessons with Preti seriously enough , " he said . " Hereafter , when anyone asks me if I understand chess , I shall say , Certainly ; I sometimes play with Mr. Morphy ! ' " Before coming to Paris , Paul had been under the impression that the creation , direction and expansion of soirees was wholly a feminine prerogative . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " at home " every Friday evening and who , while providing opportunities for whist , ecarte and other card games for his guests , was himself always to be found in a corner with the Duke of Brunswick , Count Isouard , Signor PretiGraziani 's teacherand other devotees of chess . This was the group which claimed Paul as its own ,  |p257not  only at these Friday receptions , but on every other logical occasion and some which seemed far less logical . The Duke of Brunswick declined to be separated from a chessboard even when he went to the opera ; and when Paul and Fred were invited to share his avant scene loge at a performance of Norma , Paul found he was expected to sit with his back to the stage , playing chess from the beginning to the end of the evening ! It was , perhaps , this experience , more than any one other , that made him feel that he had had enough , at least for the present , of being a social lion or , more exactly , merely a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Paul supplied a want which Paris had been feeling for some timethe want of a hero . Lequesne had asked for the honor of making his bust ; the press of Paris had begun to print humorous bits about him ; he never had a free evening . Paul had been understandably pleased and flattered by these various indications of his growing fame , and he neither sought nor desired to change his mode of life during the first " intermission " for which Harrwitz asked ; as he told Edge , he was by no means sorry to have ten days free . But when the Prussian asked for a second respite , Paul announced his intention of playing eight blindfold games , simultaneously , in the public cafe . The announcement caused great excitement . The press heralded the news ; crowds of strangers came pouring into the Regence , eagerly questioning its habitues , who were , at first , no better informed than outsiders as to the particulars of the approaching performance . When it became known Morphy had insisted that , if he played blindfold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who chose to walk in , public enthusiasm became almost unbounded and the proprietor , M. Delaunay , was equally delighted : it was easy enough to see that , under these circumstances , the exhibition would draw immense crowds to his establishment . He began to entertain a very friendly feeling for M. Morphy . It was next announced that the blindfold struggle would begin at noon and , long before this , the crowd of onlookers had begun to assemble . A space had been roped off for Paul at one end of the main hall , beyond the billiard tables , some of which had been removed to create more room , and a large easy chair had been placed for him in the enclosure thus formed . Edge , who was exceedingly anxious about his protege , tried to assure as much bodily comfort as possible , for his concern was well grounded . Paul was very far from well . He had never cared much for wine and had insisted , against all advice , on drinking the unfiltered Paris water . The consequences of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of days , he was in considerable bodily pain which he was unable to conceal from his friend . Eventually , he did not even try to do so.  | " I do n't know how I 'm going to get through my work , " he said despairingly . " I 'm afraid I 'll be obliged to keep leaving the room . If I do , some evil-minded persons are going to be sure that I 'm examining positionsoutside . " Edge did his best to be reassuring , but he , too , was troubled . The eight boards for Paul 's antagonists , forming a redoubtable phalanx , were separated from him by the billiard tables which still remained in the principal room of the cafe , and by the immense crowd of onlookers . White-aproned waiters , carrying well-laden trays , wove their way back and forth among elegant silk-hatted , frock-coated gentlemen , who were alert to every move ; and the shabbier element among the habitues , usually so much in evidence , though now in the minority , also made its excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smoked their cigars , pretending that the exhibition was of no interest to them ; but every now and then they failed to resist the temptation of casting covert glances in the direction of the armchair where Paul sat with his back to the assembly , and straining to hear his pronouncements . De Riviere called the moves for the first four boards , Journoud for the second , and everything was soon progressing swimmingly . Potier , playing at number six , rose from his table to show on another board how Morphy had actually " seen " seven moves in advance . Preti , playing at number seven , became increasingly agitated as Paul put shot after shot into his bull's-eye . Baucher , playing at number one , was the first to give in . Bornemann , at number three , soon followed with Preti , Bierworth at number two with Potier ; Guibert at four and Lequesne at five effected drawn battles and Seguin at eight was left alone . Though all the combatants were considered masters of the game , he was admittedlystrongest of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go down to defeat . The surprise to him and to everyone elselay in the fact that he was not , after all , unbeatable . When this was proved , pandemonium broke loose . Contrary to his fearful expectation , Paul had not once been obliged to leave his seat . Now he stepped from the armchair in which he had been immovable for ten consecutive hours , without having tasted a morsel of food or taken a sip of water during the entire period ; yet he was apparently as fresh as when he sat down . English and American spectators , of whom many were present , burst into lusty cheers and the French joined them as the whole crowd rushed toward the hero of the day . The waiters of the cafe had conspired beforehand to carry Paul out in triumph on their shoulders , but they could not get near him and were finally obliged to abandon the effort . Huge bearded men grasped his hands , almost shaking his arms out of their sockets , and nearly an hour passed before thep259gigantic Pere Morel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fighting a passage through the crowd . In the street , the scene was repeated . The multitude was even greater than in the cafe , the shouting even more deafening . Morphy , Bryant , de Riviere and Edge tried to make for the Palais Royal ; but the crowd pursued them and , when they reached the Guard House of the Imperial Guard , sergeantsde ville and soldiers came running out to see whether or not a new revolution , like that of 1848 , was in progress . Somehow a private upstairs room at the Restaurant Foy was finally reached and , as the good companions did justice to an excellent supper , Paul called off the moves of the day 's games . The following noon , he began his next game with Harrwitz and , at the fifty-ninth move , the Prussian " resigned . " This time , the resignation proved final . The health of Mr. Harrwitz was obviously causing him great concern . Paul , who was now really ill , since he was suffering from the results of a severe chill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be through with this disagreeable antagonist and hopeful that he need never hear of him again , in connection with his own games . However , an unexpected difficulty arose regarding the stakes . The Prussian had not deigned to consult his backers when he threw in the sponge , or even to tell them that it was his intention to do so ; they were furious for , like Paul and Fred , they were convinced that Harrwitz was a malade imaginaire or , that if he actually were ill , the indisposition was mental rather than physical . When Lequesne , who had acted as stakeholder , arrived at the hotel to turn over the substantial sum of 290 francs to the winner , he made no attempt to conceal the fact that the debts of honor had been grudgingly paid . Paul was horrified . It had never been his desire to play for money , under any circumstances , and he had consented to do so , in this instance , simply because of the condition that Harrwitz had imposed at the beginning : that Morphy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered during the match . Now , considering the generally strange and unpleasant situation which Harrwitz had himself precipitated , nothing would induce him , Paul , to take a penny . Lequesne withdrew , with understandable confusion , to return a few days later with a suggestion , which he hoped would be soothing to M. Morphy 's injured feelings : the different subscribers to the stakes were desirous that he should receive the sums that he had unquestionablywon ; however , they also felt that Herr Harrwitz should play out the remainder of the match and , to appease his backers , he would consent to do so.  | " But he has resigned the contest ! " Paul protested , his growing annoyancetinged with bewilderment . " How is is possible to go on with it when he 's already put an end to it ? " And , as Lequesne shrugged his shoulders without answering , Paul added , " Of course , we could start another match . I 'm willing to do thatimmediately . " This , however , was not at all what Harrwitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sort . Meanwhile , letters were pouring in from all quarters , complaining that bets on the result of the contest were influenced by Morphy 's refusal to accept the stakes , and when Lequesne frantically brought the 290 francs to him the second time , he consented to receive them . Nothing , however , could persuade him to keep them ; he deposited them with M. Delaunay , the proprietor of the Regence , at the same time making a public announcement : subscribersto any part of the sum in question , who were still dissatisfied with the turn things had taken , were at perfect liberty to withdraw from it the amount to which they felt entitled . If , after this had been done , there were any money left , perhaps it could be used to defray the expense to which Adolph Anderssen would be put if he left his Breslau Gymnasium in order to play with Morphy in Paris . The suggestion was not made seriously . Nevertheless , to Paul 's great satisfaction , this was exactly how the money was ultimately used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of visiting the principal chess centers in Germany , thus responding to urgent invitations ; but as long as there was still a chance that he might return to England in November , for the match to which Staunton had committed himself in Birmingham , he hesitated to put any additional distance between himself and London , still more to move from place to place in such a way that correspondence might be slow in catching up with him , as had happened before . He was convinced that Staunton would be only too glad to seize on any possible pretext for saying that the responsibility for their failure to meet lay at Paul 's door . Early in October , he had written a long letter to the Englishman which revealed that he had been deeply hurt by the latter 's public sneers about the lack of seconds and stakes , and recapitulating what had passed between them . Then he had added : " Permit me to repeat what I have invariably declared in every chess community I have had the honor of entering , that I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possess the means of pecuniary advancementand that my earnest desire is never to play for any stake but honor . My friends in New Orleans , however , subscribeda certain sum , without any countenance from me , and that sum has been ready for you a considerable time past . Since my arrival in Paris , I have been assured by numerous gentlemen that the value of thosep261stakes can be immediately increased to any amount ; but , for myself personally , reputation is the only incentive I recognize . " He might have added that , besides the " numerous gentlemen " who had offered to increase the stakes to any amount , the Princess Mathilde , addressing Edge in the hearing of all her guests , had exclaimed at one of her soirees , " Please tell M. Morphy from me that for ten thousand pounds against Mr. Staunton or any other player in Europe , he must go no further than this house ! " Indeed , the temptation to do this had been very strong , for no sponsor in Europe enjoyed more prestige than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence , where any gentlewoman was involved , prevented him from making such a proud boast . He contented himself , as far as seconds were concerned , by sayinghe was sure these could be found at St. George 's , and again requestedStaunton to fix a date for their match , since " early November " had obviously proved inconvenient . He did not refrain from adding that he was sending copies of his letter to the Illustrated London News , Bell 's Life , Era , Field and The Sunday Times ; he was all too sure , by now , that Staunton 's sense of propriety would not compel him , on his own initiative , to make the letter public . Staunton 's answer had been prompt , but it had been crushing : he definitely withdrew from any promise he might have made to play a match ; his work prevented him from getting adequate practice ; perhaps if Morphy visited England again they might play a few games sans fawn . That was all . As a result of this correspondence , an acrimonious wrangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the great majority of contributors to these were on Morphy 's side , his injured feelings and hurt pride , far from being assuaged , were lacerated over and over again as the undignified dispute went on . To he sure , his conscience was clear and it seemed to him that this was also true of his case . He had come to Europe above all to play Staunton , whom he complimented by regarding as the leading master in Europe . Perhaps erroneously , but at least in good faith , he had taken Staunton 's statement of April 3rd to mean that the champion was ready to play him in London ; and , if he had been mistaken , Staunton could have easily corrected his wrong impression as soon as they met at the St. George 's . Far from doing this , he had let Morphy continue to think that a match would be played sometime in 1858 if the young American would wait until Staunton could find a convenientdate . And finally , he had ridiculed his opponent as an adventurerwithout backing and furtively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Harrwitz had ended more happily , Paul could , perhaps , have dismissed easily from his mind his grievance against Staunton.  |p262However  , though he had not only played with the Prussian , but defeated him , the conditions under which the match had taken place and the hard feeling at the end , about stakes , had depressed him deeply . Now , just as he had hoped that a victory over Harrwitz , who had beaten Staunton , might be a compensation for the contest that had never taken place in England , so he felt that a victory over Anderssen who was , by all accounts , both a gentleman and a scholar , and who had won the InternationalTournament of 1851 , would more than compensate for all previous unpleasant experiences at the chess table . What was more , such a victory would prove , beyond any shadow of a doubt , that he , Paul Morphy , was the Chess Champion of the world . Under all these circumstances , his tentative plan of a trip to Germany was entirely logical . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of missing connections with Staunton if he undertook it , there were various reasons why he was loath to leave Paris . One of these was the state of his health . Though he had always declined to use this as an excuse for not fulfilling his engagements and looked with contempt on those who did , he was beginning to suffer the consequences of his refusal to do so . He and Fred had now moved from the elegant Meurice to the less pretentious Hotel de Breteuil , which was also pleasantly located on the rue de Rivoli ; and their apartment , facing the Tuileries Gardens , was sunny and spacious . Paul could be kept very comfortable there ; and the physician , who was now attending him and who had finally succeeded in persuading him to stay abed , was horrified at the mere suggestion that he might go to Breslau or Berlin , or both . If his patient 4 had not been able to endure the rigors of the Parisian climate , so much more severe than those to which he was accustomed , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north ? The contention was probably more effective because Paul had been leeched and was too weak for much argument . He watched the doctor depart without attemptingany , then turned to Edge and asked him , with a wan smile , to hazard a guess as to how much blood had been lost . " Oh , three or four pints , I should guess , " Edge answered cheerfully . " I do n't believe there 's another drop in my body . " Paul closed his eyes and lay quite still , trying to determine for himselfhis best course of action . It was true that he felt too ill to undertake a long journey , even though this could be made by train and therefore would probably be less disastrous in its consequences than another sea voyage , and that in winter . But there was another reason why he did not want to leave Paris : a trip to Germany would mean separation from Charmian , whom he now saw daily except when he was actually confined to his bed . Was even a victory over Anderssen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , of course . For a lover , no , of course not . Which was he , primarily ? His good sense should have told him . As a chess player , only Anderssenwas left to challenge his supremacy and a match between them would quickly settle that question , with the odds in his favor . As a lover , he was still far from his desired goal . True , it had never occurred to him to make Charmian his mistressmarriage , not a liaison , was his aim ; and , though he had been tempted , over and over again , to claim her completely , he had so far always succeeded in resisting . It was not thanks to her that this was so ; if he had taken her , he could not possibly have reproached himself for seduction ; though she had never said this , in so many words , he knew that she was not only conscious of his temptation , but ready and willing to have him yield to it . It was he , not she , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was her very innocence which was responsible for her attitude . She knew , as well as he did , that many , perhaps most , of the great ladies in the world where she now moved so easily and gracefully had lovers , and she saw no reason why she should not do the same . He found himself unable to explain to her . He could not say that these were matrons , whereas she was a virgin ; that would seem to infer that the marriage vow was not one which need be taken seriously , and this was the last thing he wanted to do . When she became his wife , he would expect her to take it seriously , indeed he would feel dishonored if she did not . He often felt that , in all fairness , he should go again to her father and plead for the formal betrothal which would lead , without delay , to the altar . But he had done this twice already and twice had been rebuffed . Albert Sheppard was a man who did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time was not yet ripe for matrimony ; if Paul were too insistent , he might well find himself deprived of his present " privileges " and that would be heartbreakingfor himself and , he fondly believed , for Charmian , also . It was much better to drift along as they were . Mrs. Sheppard , he felt sure , had no idea that such drifting was dangerous for her daughter ; possibly Berenice was wiser , but no small part of her wisdom was revealed through her silence . Edge made no attempt to break in on his friend 's reveries . But the day after the leeching , he came into Paul 's room and sat down on the bed , obviously the bearer of important tidings . " You can forget about going to Germany , " he said in a triumphant tone . " What are you talking about ? I ca n't forget it . That 's just the trouble . " " It should n't be any trouble at all . Anderssen is coming here to play with you . "  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It is n't a joke . Your friends at the Regence have acted on your suggestion that the money from those damned stakes might be used to pay Anderssen 's expenses to Paris . " " But I did n't make that suggestion seriously . I knew he could n't leave his classes . " " Not during term time . There 's nothing to prevent his having a vacation when his pupils do , at Christmastime . Or so he says . In fact , he 's already accepted the invitation . " " But I ca n't wait for him that long ! I 'm supposed to go home for Christmas . " " You 're not supposed to do anything of the sort . In the first place , your doctor wo n't hear of it . If he advised you against a train trip to Berlin , how do you suppose he feels about a trans-Atlantic crossing in December ? Well , I 'll tell you : he feels it would be suicidal . I 've already written your mother to that effect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day now , saying that she understands perfectly , that she 'd be much easier to have you stay where you are . There are plenty of Christmasesahead that you can spend in New Orleans . . . what 's more , " Fred went on , lighting a cigar , " I 've just had an interesting talk with the Sheppards about a Christmas celebration . When I saw you were settling down to take a nap , I decided it would be a good chance for me to pay a little visit at the rue des Saints Peres . And Charmian told me to ask if you remembered a Christmas party at their house in New Orleans that you went to years ago ? " " Yes , " said Paul shortly . " I remember it . What else did she say ? " " Only that mistletoe grows in France , too . "  |p266The  doctor 's verdict against travel , whether by land or by sea , was , as it proved , quite superfluous ; his patient had become so weakened that , though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over and over again , he could not stand on his feet . Part of his debility was unquestionablydue to the attack of influenza which he had persistently refused to recognize as a serious illness as long as he considered himself bound to play with Harrwitz . When he finally took to his bed , his fever had already been high for several days , his cough racking and persistent ; that he had escaped pneumonia was in itself a minor miracle . But his recovery might have been much more rapid , if he had consented to rest and medication at the beginning of his indisposition , instead of postponingthese until his condition was actually alarming . Now , as one dreary December day succeeded another , and his strength still failed to return , it looked more and more doubtful if he could be up and about before Christmas . Edge , who had watched over him with affectionate anxiety , found some consolation in the fact that Paul , whose moods of depression were so often a handicap both to himself and those who were attached to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day after day , as Fred helped him back to bed when he had been sitting only a short time in an armchair by the window which " gave " so pleasantly on the Tuileries Gardens , he said cheerfully that , after all , he was quite comfortable as long as he stayed between the sheets , propped up with pillows ; he was not feverish any more , he was coughingless and less and he was quite free from pain ; since there had been this much of an improvement , surely it was reasonable to expect that there would soon be more . Edge had hesitated to let him know when Anderssen actually left Breslau , fearing that Paul would begin to fret over the fact that he was in no condition to meet this adversary ; but deciding that the news was bound to reach the invalid sooner or later , and that it was better this should be broken gently , he finally overcame his scruples . Instead of showing the least concern , Paul plumped up his pillows and called for a chessboard . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaily . " What , again ? " " Oh , not the kind of fever you 're thinking ofit 's time to forget all about that . This is a chess fever ! Go ahead , be a good fellow . Give me a board and pieces . I 'll show you some of Anderssen 's games . "  |p267The  next few hours were spent in recreating battles , all with different adversaries and with numerous variations . Finally , he dilated at length about a certain game in which , though under the mate , Anderssen sacrificedhis Queen and , after several moves , forced his opponent to resign . " There ! " Paul exclaimed , leaning contentedly back among his pillows . " If that does n't show the master , I do n't know what would . You may take away the board now if you want to , Fred . And what about some supper ? I believe I 'll try to get up for it . I 'm getting terribly tired of trays . Our garcon could bring in a little table and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You might even persuade me to have a glass of wine , if you tried hard enough ! " Their evening was the pleasantest they had passed in a long while . When Fred bade his friend good night , it was with the happy conclusion that Paul was really on the mend at last ; and the next morning , when he entered the sick room at ten o'clock , he found that Anderssen had already arrived to pay his respects and that he had promptly been invited to share Paul 's cafe au lait . He had , he explained , reached Paris the previous evening and had hastened to call at what seemed to be the earliest suitable moment ; no one had informed him that M. Morphy was ill . He had apologized for the intrusion , but M. Morphy , as M. Edge could see , had been most cordial and insisted that they must breakfast together ; of course , he would leave immediately thereafter , so that there might be no danger of tiring the invalid . He would not think of talking over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state to undergo the fatigue of one . No , no , Paul protested , polishing off his last croissant ; of course they must talk over arrangements ; he was sure he would be well enough to play any day nowwell , almost any day . Herr Anderssenbecame convinced it would do the invalid no harm for him to prolonghis present visit and perhaps they might agreetentatively , of courseon a date to begin playing . This was the 14th . Well , what about the 20th ? He would suggest a later day , but unfortunately his holiday lasted only a fortnight . However , perhaps they might play in this pleasant apartment instead of at the Regence ; that , at least , would spare M. Morphy a very considerable effort . The 20th would suit Paul perfectlywhy , given a week , he would feel as strong as a lion ! And yes , he was sure there would be less oppositionfrom his physician if they played at the Breteuil , where there would be room for only a few specially invited spectators ; after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Regence . Should they decide now on the number of games in the match ? A possible thirteen ? That is ,  |p268the  one who first scored seven should be declared the victor ? Good ! What about stakes ? Herr Anderssen desired none but honor ? Better and better ! That was exactly the way Paul felt about the matter himself ! Well , since everything was now amicably settled , as far as chess was concerned , what about a little sightseeing ? Paul and Fred understood that this was the first visit Herr Anderssen had made to Paris . Fred would be delighted to take him to the Louvre and anywhere else he would like to go . The sightseeing , Fred reported to Paul some hours later , had been a great success except for the fact that the Place de Carrousel had been very muddy after the heavy rain of the previous evening , and Herr Anderssen had been much concerned because he could not keep his boots clean while crossing it ! They laughed together over the preoccupation with neatness which had prevented the visitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art and architecture so lavishly spread out before him ; but there was no division of opinion between them regarding the likeability of this massive , middle-aged German , whose consideration and courtesy formed such a welcome contrast to the boorishness of Harrwitz . " Did you notice his smile ? There 's something actually sweet about it , though that seems a strange thing to say in describing a man of his years and experience . " " Of course I noticed it . And I do n't think it 's strange at all to speak of it in that way . I thought it was in character with the rest of his personality , including his voice . That was sweet , too , like honey . " " Well , there 's no doubt that his face is as pleasant as it is expressive and he seems extraordinarily placid . Just the same , I 've heard that , as a player , he 's very excitable . " " Excitable , perhaps , but reasonable . I do n't dread the match with him at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . I 've hesitated to tell you , cher , but since all the trouble with Staunton and Harrwitz , I 've had moments of feeling I never wanted to play chess again . It was probablyjust because I was so ill . Anyway , I feel very differently nowphysically and mentally both . I 'm sure I 'll be able to sit up longer today without suddenly starting to pitch over . " His optimism proved well founded . He neither " pitched over " nor grew dizzy in trying to get from the bed to the armchair and he remained at the window for nearly two hours before he confessed to fatigue . The next day , he sat up both morning and evening , received several visitors and called again for his chessboard . At noon on the 20th , fully dressed for the first time , he went with Edge into the small salon where the match was to be played . Anderssen was already there and , far from showing any signs of impatience , asked solicitously for Paul 's health before con/renting to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game if , at any moment , he did not feel equal to continuing it . Within five minutes as many moves had been made ; but Edge could not help noticing that Paul had already begun to be restless , instead of playing , as usual , with his eyes fixed steadfastly on the board , his expressionimpassive and his body immobile . He did not , however , avail himself of Anderssen 's courteous suggestion that he might stop at any moment . The game continued for more than seven hours without interruption . Then , after seventy moves , Paul , who had opened with the Evans gambit , lost it . He did not seem unduly fatigued by the effort he had made to sit up so long , or much depressed by his failure to win . Instead , as Edge helped him back to bed , he chatted about Anderssen 's defense , with which he declared himself charmed . The next day , though his pallor and restlessnesspersisted , his spirits were amazingly good and remained so even when the game was drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked into the salon unassisted , his face fresh , his eyes sparkling . He would like to have a turn at the Ruy Lopez , he said , since Anderssen had found that so favorable to success . They had been playing only an hour , when Anderssen laughingly resigned , with the suggestion that , since they had spent so little time at the board , M. Morphy would perhaps give him another chance that same day . " Of course . Maybe the next game wo n't take long , either . " " I 'm sure it wo n't , if you dash along at the same furious rate , M. Morphy . " The " furious rate " was not prompted only by a desire to score brilliantly ; Paul had set his heart on doing some Christmas shopping . He had prudently neglected to mention this beforehand to Edge , who , he was sure , would raise all manner of objections ; in the presence of a comparative stranger , he would be more inhibited . As Anderssen rose from the table , confessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to the Regence to expedite reports to his friends in Leipzig and Berlin , as he did every day , Paul also rose with alacrity and said they might take a fiacre together ; he was going in the same direction as Anderssen , but continuing a little further . " Paul , you must be crazy ! " Edge exclaimed , leaping up and trying to bar the door . " Nonsense ! It 's a beautiful day for a change and I have n't had a breath of fresh air for weeks . I 'll feel a lot better when I have . " " Is that all you 're going out fora breath of fresh air ? " " Yes , practically . I thought I might do one errandat Cartier 's . " Again Edge realized that this was another of those occasions whenp270argument with Paul was futile . He might be back in bed the next day , but meanwhile he intended to buy Charmian a present ; and if he found something that pleased her , and she made it evident that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not his shopping expeditioneventually spelled pneumonia . As a matter of fact , it seemed to do him no harm . He continued to improve in health and spirits day by day and he won the fifth and sixth games in the contest without more apparent effort than he had won the third and fourth . Anderssen had plans of his own for Christmas Eve , which he had been invited to spend with German friends living in Paris . He took a genial leave of Paul and Fred and , having sped him on his way , they set out gaily for the rue des Saints Peres . As their fiacre drew up at the great outer gate , which had gradually come to seem less formidable to them , they were disturbed to see the neat carriage of the eminent physician who attended Mrs. Sheppard drawn up at the curb . " Is Madame ill , really ill ? " Paul inquired anxiously of the concierge , with whom he was now on the friendliest terms . " Not only really ill , but very ill , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monsieur le medecin told her yesterday that she should give up all idea of the party tonight , but she refused . She was sure she would be better . She has much merit , that woman ! And now alas ! she is worse . There will be no fete tonight . However , the young ladies are expecting the young North American gentlemen . My instructions are that they are to go in . " Considerably sobered , Paul and Fred walked across the vast paved court . Charmian was not watching from the window of the petit salon and no fire was lighted there ; it was obvious that they were not expected to linger . They sat for a few minutes in chilly silence and then a nun , wearing the habit of a nursing order , came into the room on noiseless footsteps . The clicking of the long wooden rosary which she wore at her side made the only sound . " I am sorry to tell you , " she said in a soft , grave voice , " that it will be quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight . Monsieur le docteur and another Sister are with Madame Sheppard and her husband and daughters are remaining on call in an adjacent boudoir . They may be summoned at any moment to bid her a last sad farewell . She was advised , long ago , that she should go south , that she should not risk the possible consequences of exposure to cold weather . We can only pray that it may now not be too late for her to heed this advice . " The nun paused for a moment and then continued in a different tone , though still speaking very gravely , " Mademoiselle Charmian thought itp271possible that you gentlemen might be bringing some little gifts to herself and her sister . If she is right and you would care to entrust them to me , I shall be glad to see they are deliveredat a moment more propitious than this one . I shall also be glad to accept any little donation you may care to make for the orphans in our Home . It would make Reverend Mother very happy . " Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not shadowed by actual tragedy ; to everyone 's surprise , Madame was holding her own , the conciergeannounced , when Paul and Fred went to inquire for her in the morning . Paul sat down for the seventh and eighth games in the contest with more heart for them than he would have believed possible twelve hours earlier and won the first , though the second was a draw . On the 26th , the report from the sick room was the same and Paul was sorry that Anderssen again had plans for celebrations with compatriots . On the following day , although the news was not so good , he managed to win the ninth game . The tenth , which was played the same day , Anderssencarried off in seventy-seven moves . If he were dependent on Mrs. Sheppard 's progress to win the match , Paul reflected , he might easily lose it ; but that had now become a minor consideration . All that matteredwas that this lovely , gentle lady , who had shown him so much kindness , should not be a victim of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Happily , the bulletins continued to be reassuring and the games went on in orderly fashion , though Anderssen , again proving himself understandingand sympathetic , said he had learned this was a period of great anxiety to his antagonist and if it seemed wiser to discontinue the match . ... No , Paul assured him , he was better off at the chess table than he would be alone in his room , brooding ; he could not possibly put his mind on anything else , and though he went twice a day to the rue des Saints Peres , he could linger at the Hotel d'Ambres only long enough to make inquiries ; all the rest of his waking hours were empty except for those he spent with Herr Anderssen ; they were , consequently , a godsend . The eleventh game Paul won in seventeen moves and , picking up the pieces , Anderssen laughed in his pleasant quiet way . " M. Morphy wins in seventeen moves , " he said , " I in seventy-odd . That is natural . The surprising thing is that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I am not playing as well as I did against Dufresne and I am obliged to reply , No , M. Morphy wo n't let me ! ' " Anderssen left for Breslau the same afternoon , with many expressions of heartfelt good will on both sides ; and when Paul went to make inquiriesat the Hotel d'Ambres that evening , the concierge told him thatp272Madame had passed the crisis and that Mademoiselle Charmian would be glad to see him if he would care to remain . He crossed the courtyard in a series of bounds , and it was only a matter of minutes before his sweetheart was at last in his arms again . This time he held her tenderly , keeping his passion in check , and murmuringwords of comfort and encouragement , rather than of ardor . He saw , with delight , that she was wearing the heart-shaped diamond locket he had bought for her and listened , with rapture , to her words of thanks for such a lovely present . " It 's beautiful , Paul , it really is , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it any place . I did n't feel quite that way about the little turquoise pendant you gave me so many years ago . Not that I do n't treasure it . I keep it safely locked in my jewel box and every now and then I take it out and look at it . But you know how it is in Pariswomen wear such magnificent bracelets , earrings and necklaces , and even tiaras , just as we 'd wear a string of beads . I 'd be a little self-conscious . " " Of course , darling , I understand perfectly . I only wish I could buy you necklaces and bracelets and earrings . Perhaps I can someday . " " Why , Paul , you did n't think I was hinting , did you ? This diamond locket is adorable , and there 's a place in it for a picture , is n't there ? Have you had one taken on purpose for me ? " " No , I have n't had a chance , because I have been ill , too , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but ill enough so that an old dragon of a doctor , who kept bleeding me , and Fred , who can be a good deal of a fuss-budget , managed to keep me in bed for three weeks . That 's why you did n't see me for such a long time . But I wrote you nearly every day and Fred brought the notes when he came to see Berenice . Do n't tell me you did n't get them . " " Poor Fred ! He 's wasting his time as far as Berenice is concerned , but I 'm glad he brought me the notes . Of course , I got them and they were sweet ! I kept meaning to answer , but somehow I never got around to . December was so frightfully gay . " " Yes , I understand about that , too . I 'll have a picture taken for the locket directly after the New Year . " " Oh , please do ! You 've had one taken with Anderssen already , have n't you ? I heard you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday and at his request . " " Was it part of his request that it should be taken at the house of the Baronne de la Sange ? " " Yes , by the time it reached me . I think she may have suggested it in the beginning . " " Will she show in the picture ? She and all her old statues and things ? "  | " I do n't know . Perhaps . But what difference could that possibly make , darling ? " " Oh , none , I suppose ! But I get awfully tired of her silly talk about fellow Creoles . I 'm glad there 's going to be a picture on purpose for me to put in the locket . I 'll have it to remember you by . " " Remember me by ! Do you imagine I 'll give you a chance to forget me ? " " Not really , of course . But our dragon of a doctor says we must go south the minute Mama 's able to travel , and he thinks that should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis ' he 's continually talking about is over . It seems that , when you have pneumonia , you keep going downhill for five days and then you either die or start getting better . Well , Mama 's getting better , there 's no doubt about that , even if the dragon-like doctor and those two dreary grasping nuns do keep on talking and acting as if there still would n't be any hope for her unless we did exactly what they said . " " But naturally , you will . " " Yes , naturally . As a matter of fact , I 'm not at all sorry that I 'm going to have a chance to see Nice . Everyone seems to have a very good time there , everyone in good health of course , I mean . But Mama ought to get some pleasure out of it , too . Papa 's engaged a whole floor in the best hotel on the Boulevard des Anglais , and " " You wo n't be away from Paris long though , will you ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to stay south until it gets warm , of course , and Berenice will stay with her . Perhaps Papa and I will come back without them . It all depends . " " On what ? " " Oh , several things . But you wo n't miss me , will you I mean too much ? " " I 'm not sure just what you mean by too much . I 'll miss you terribly , I know that and so do you . " " Well , you should make an effort to see more of other people . That pretty cousin of yours , Natalie Benjamin , keeps complaining that you never come to her house . She is your cousin , is n't she ? " " Yes , she was a St. Martin . The St. Martins and the Le Carpentiers are very closely related , but " He stopped , embarrassed . He did not like to say that Natalie 's reputationfor levity was such that he had decided the less he was seen in her company the better . Even by the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Charmian neither noticed his hesitation nor guessed the reason for it . " Well , now is your time to placate her . And I understand the Ameri/can Minister , Mr. Mason , is really quite annoyed because you have n't dined with him but once . It seems he 's asked you several more times and you 've always said you were engaged . " " So I am , darling . I 'm engaged to you . " " Oh , that 's not what I mean at all and you know it ! I mean you always say you 're dining somewhere else . Now you wo n't be dining here at all for a while and that 'll give you more free evenings , though I do know you have lots of other invitations . By the way , the Princess Mathilde says the Emperor has expressed a wish to meet you and , of course , once it would have been the easiest thing in the world for her to arrange , as she 's his best beloved cousin . But since he married a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audience must be arranged through the American Minister , so if you want to meet the Emperor , you 'd better improve your standing with Mason . " " I do n't know that I especially want to meet the Emperor . But if you think it 's an opportunity I should n't miss " " Oh , I do ! And now that you 're through with Anderssenyou are through with Anderssen , are n't you ? " " Yes , just . To my regret . He 's a wonderful personthe most splendid and chivalrous player I ever encountered . I was sorry to see him leave . " " Then you 're champion of the world now ? " " Yes , I suppose so . " " And you wo n't need to play chess any more ? " " I do n't need to , but of course I want to . I 'm hoping to play with Mongredien , the President of the London Chess Club , next . He 's offered to come to Paris on purpose to play with me , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to London . I did n't want to do that . I did n't want to be parted from you . And now you 're going yourself . " " But , Paul , I 'm not leaving for Nice right away ! Perhaps not for several weeks yet . And I 'm coming back just as soon as I can . It would n't seem natural if I did n't find you here . You will wait for me , wo n't you ? " After their first embrace , they had been sitting quietly side by side , in front of the pleasant fire , while they talked together . Now she threw herself into his arms again . When , at last , he released her , he knew what his answer must be. 26 . It was neither surprising nor disturbing to Paul that , during the next few weeks , he saw very little of Charmian . It was natural that the Hotel d'Ambres should be kept as quiet as possible for , even though the invalid remained secluded , the consciousness of much coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was essential that all risk of this should be avoided . The stir of preparation for departure was in itself a menace to the complete stillness which the doctor would have liked to impose on the household ; and of course it was unthinkable that Charmian should dash from one party to another under the present conditions . For some reason she seemed to have taken a dislike to the Baronne de la Sange or she and Paul might easily have met at her hospitable house on the days she was not officially at home and was receiving only a few friends for lunch or dinner . It was too cold for drives in the Bois and it was not customary for girls of good family to go to restaurants . Besides , Charmian told Paul , at one of their infrequent meetings , she had to spend most of her time , when she could leave the house , with dressmakers ; nothing that she or Berenice or their mother had was suitable for wear in the South . She was responsible for three new outfits , since her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . As she and Berenice were about the same size , she tried on dresses for both and minor alterations were made on her sister 's clothes afterward . Of course , her mother needed nothing except negligees for the time being , but mercy ! that dragon of a doctorPaul had certainly described him exactlyobjected to the presence of a seamstress in the house or even brief visits from a vendeuse or a fitter . She , Charmian , really had an undertaking on her hands to see that they all had what they needed when so many obstacles were put in her way ... . " Are n't there any dressmakers in Nice ? " Paul asked innocently . " I mean , could n't you get what you need right away and then add to your wardrobes after you reach the South ? " " You talk just like a man ! Papa asked that same question . I suppose there are dressmakers in Nice , but we do n't know yet who the best ones are and things like that take time to find out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be free to enjoy myself . I might just as well spend my time at the dressmaker 's as anywhere else while the weather is so awful and while everyone thinks it would be heartless if I had any fun . Not that 1 can see why . It was different those five days when Mama 's life was actually in danger . She 's convalescent now . " 278 The Chess PlayersPaul started to say that if Charmian did not spend so much time at the dressmaker 's she might have more to spend with him , but thought better of it . For a different reason , he refrained from saying he understood that pneumonia often left a patient 's heart in a rather tricky conditionand that , even though a convalescent 's condition seemed to be good , watchfulness was almost as essential as quiet . He did not want to alarm for her nothing ... . Several times when he entered one of the drawing rooms which , in accordance with Charmian 's expressed wishes , he continued to frequent even though she could not go with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abruptly terminated or that its subject was swiftly changed at his approach . Once he was very sure that unfriendly remarks were being made about someone he knew and tried to identify the victim . As he thought the matter over , he decided that the talk had centered on Natalie Benjamin and , since everyone knew he and she were cousins , it was natural that this should have been hurriedly stilled . It was unfortunate that her conduct should have become a matter of such general scandal , but , after all , that did not touch him personally . She was older than he , they had never been closely associated . Every family had its black sheep . There was no reason why he should be greatly concerned . It was finally decided that Charmian , her father and one of the nursing sisters should go before the others to Nice , to make sure everything was in readiness for the convalescent when she arrived ; and that Mrs. Sheppard herself should be accompanied by Berenice , the second sister and the doctor . Paul was obliged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annoyed with himself because he wished the plan had been made in reverse ; if it had , then the necessity for quiet in the house would have been obviated ; he and Charmian even might have had a cosy little dinner with her father the night before their departure , relieved to know that the period of preparation was over , Mrs. Sheppardsafely on her way in good hands . As it was , of course nothing of the sort was possible . The final visit that he had with her in the petit salon was punctuated with tiresome interruptions about shawl straps , tea baskets , chamois-covered traveling cushions and undelivered bonnets . At the station , a dozen acquaintances came to speed father and daughter on their journey ; and these well-wishers were not only vociferous in their expression of regret at the Sheppards ' departure ; they were the bearers of immense stiff bouquets , huge boxes of bonbons and sheafs of reading material . The train was already pulling out of the station before everyone had been properly thanked . Paul did not even have a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far managed to " The King of Games " 279keep in check suddenly engulfed him . He had no idea when he would see her again and he knew , from past experience , that she did not shine as a correspondent . His sense of separation from her was overpowering . Under these conditions , the arrival in Paris of Mr. Mongredien , the genial President of the London Chess Club , was a godsend . Since the match with Anderssen , Paul had played very littleindeed , there had been a recurrence of the distaste for chess which he had admitted during his illness , and a few offhand games with St. Amant , who had now become one of his most valued personal friends , constituted his only activities in that direction . But the arrival of Mongredien , and the knowledge of the effort this distinguished gentleman had made in order to play against him , had a salutary effect on Paul . He was not insensible to the compliment Mongredien had paid him and which had been duly reported , that while the mature Englishman knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwilling to forego the pleasure of a tilt with him . " As Paul entered the Hotel de Louvre , where Mongredien was staying , he could feel the " chess fever , " as he had called it , rising in him again ; and he was delighted when he found that , besides Edge , St. Amant and de Riviere were to be the only spectators to the contest . The first game , admirably played by Mongredien , who continued his self-depreciation , resulted in a draw ; in the second , Paul scored seven parties one after the other ; and the third slipped from his opponent 's grasp after a ten hour struggle . Mongredien made none of the standard excuses of Staunton and Harrwitz as long as the contest lasted , but , once it was over , he confessed himself exhausted . How Mr. Morphy could still seem not only alert but fresh was beyond his comprehension . " Why sir , you should have seen him in New York ! " Edge exclaimed . " During the Congress , I saw him sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning and play continuously until after midnight , winning over one antagonist after another ! And none of this seemed to weaken him in the least . " " Yet I understand that recently he 's been seriously ill . Youth is a strong ally and energy and persistence are wonderful qualities in chess or in anything else . But it is an error to mistake them for strength ... . Forgive me if what I have just said sounds like an impertinence , " he added kindly , putting his hand on Paul 's shoulder . " It was n't meant that way , I assure you . It was prompted by concern and , if you will permit me to say so , affection . You 've made a good many friends since you came abroad , Mr. Morphy . It is natural that we should be concerned lest you might overdo . Have I told you Herr Lowenthal sends you his best regards ? You know , he is one of your staunchest admirers ! And he is280 The Chess Playersvery hopeful that you can come back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's working on . " " I did n't misunderstand what you said to me , sir . I appreciate your friendship , and Fred should n't tell tales out of school like that . Do n't put too much stock in them anywayhe always exaggerates . " Paul cast a withering glance in the direction of his friend and went on , " I really do n't know what to say about London . I 'm not sure I should try to return there . Of course , I 'm complimented at Herr Lwenthal 's suggestionthat I might be helpful to him , but I 've hesitated to accept his invitation . " " On account of Staunton ? My dear fellow , that 's absurd ! You 'll find a royal welcome waiting for you , with that erstwhile champion still sulking in his tent , sore because he is n't included in the festivities and is n't entitled to be . " Paul hesitated , but it did not seem quite fair to let Mr. Mongredien leave with the impression that distaste for even the most casual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning to London . " My family is beginning to feel I 've been away long enough , " he said . " They understood when my physician told me I should n't attempta trans-Atlantic crossing in midwinter , but the weather will soon be more favorable . And I 've rather cogent reasons why I feel I ought to get started with law , now that I 'm legally of an age to practice . On the other hand , I 've promised to stay in Paris until aa friend of mine , who had to leave here because of illness in the family , comes back . I 'm afraid that when I 've kept that promise , I ought to take the first ship home . " " Well , of course you must keep your promise . And I quite understand your family 's wish to have you return and your eagerness to get started in your profession . But I 'm still not going to give up hope of seeing you in London again this spring . Are you willing I should tell Lowenthal you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course . I 'm willing you should do that . " St. Amant suggested that they might all go on to the Regence and , though de Riviere and Edge accepted the invitation with pleasure , Mongredien pleaded the necessity of packing and Paul said that he hoped , under those circumstances , that the others would excuse him , too . He walked slowly back to the Breteuil , so deep in thought that he was hardly conscious of the route he was taking , though this led him through one of his favorite parts of Parisalong the rue de Rivoli and past the Louvre , the Place Napoleon and the Place du Carrousel , where Anderssenhad muddied his shoes ; he did not realize he had gone by the Palais des Tuileries until he became aware of the Gardens beyond it . Ever since " The King of Games " 281Mr . Sheppard had spoken to him seriously about settling down , as a necessary prelude to matrimony , he had been giving more and more sober thought to it . But as long as he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappoint his backers , and his ambition to prove himself , indubitably , chess champion of the world , when he was so close to realizing this desire , had not unnaturally been even stronger than the urge toward law . Besides , as long as Charmian was in Paris and he could continue to see her almost daily , under advantageous conditions , he had not felt the postponement of their marriage too hard to accept , especially as he recognized that his prospective father-in-law was right in saying that Charmian would need to have her fling sometime and that it was better she should have it before marriage than after . But now the contests were over , he had no more commitments , he was champion of the world and he was not seeing Charmian almost every dayin fact , he was not seeing her at all . It was only his promise to await her return that was keeping him abroad . His fears that he might not hear from her frequently or satisfactorily had been more than justified . She wrote him hurried little notes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but giving him very little news . Gradually , he gathered that the hotel of their choice had proven luxurious , elegant and ideally located , but that the wardrobe she had taken such pains to select had not been adequate after all and that she was obliged to spend a great deal of time in supplementing it . The sunshine was splendid , but the days were short and , after the sun went down , Nice was not much was flier than Paris , nor was it nearly as gay as she had expected . There were an appalling number of invalids in evidence , some of them much sicker than her mother , many of them being wheeled about in bath chairs by attendants , which , of course , did not enliven the scene very much . Naturally , they did not know many people in Nice and lots of Americansseemed to feel that the best way of getting acquainted was through sharing in the church activities , which were terribly dull , and taking tea with the Consul 's wife , who was an old frump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed the time , if Jacques d'Ambres , the friend who had loaned them the house in Paris , and who was a perfect dear , had not managed to wangle a holiday just then . Of course , he was an older man and devoted himself mainly to Mama ; still he was someone to talk to and ride with once in a while and he could be quite good fun . Jacques d'Ambres had not been mentioned between Paul and Fred since their first conversation on that subject , and Paul was gratified to find the guesses he had made on that occasion about the Sheppards ' benefactor had obviously been correct ; the marquis was an older man , devoted to the invalid , and it had been indeed fortunate that he had282 The Chess Playersbeen able to go to Nice at that time to relieve the tedium of the stay there . What troubled Paul was not Jacques d'Ambres ' presence on the Riviera ; it was Charmian 's indefinite absence from Paris . None of the hurried notes made any reference to her return with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been discussed before their departure . In his own letters , Paul had referred to this several times , but his questionshad remained unanswered . He was sorely tempted to break away and start for Nice himself , instead of prolonging his anxious wait . However , it had not been suggested that he should go there and the hesitant hint that perhaps he might do so had resulted in a letter from Mr. Sheppard which , far from encouraging him , quickly disabused his mind that it might be a good idea . If Paul came to Nice , Mrs. Sheppard would insist on seeing him , as he was one of her favorites ; and her physician had strictly forbidden visitors ; besides , it was probably a very good thing that he and Charmian should be separated for a time ; it would give them a chance to be surer of their feelings . . . The tone of the letter came very close to being curt and Paul felt that this was unwarranted . Evidently the Marquis d'Ambres was permitted to see Mrs. Sheppardor was he revealing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheppard knew that no one could be surer of his feelings than Paul ; was Charmian 's father intimating that she did not even yet know her own mind ? Considering her attitude toward her suitor in the last few months , such an intimation was an insult to her ... . He was still so deep in these unhappy thoughts that he actually passed the Breteuil without realizing he had already reached his destination . He turned , annoyed with himself at such a careless preoccupation . As he went through the lobby , he was told that he had a visitor and , as the gentleman had said he was Mr. Morphy 's brother-in-law , he had been permitted to mount to the apartment . The concierge hoped no indiscretionhad been committed ... Paul had always liked John Sybrandt and , on general principles , would not have been surprised to see him at any time in Paris , where he now had such important business connections . However , as months had gone by and there had been no intimation that such a visit was imminent , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Besides , at the moment , he did not feel equal to entertaining a guest ; whatever Fred might think or say , Paul did not leave a chess table , after a ten hour struggle , " as fresh as when he sat down to it . " He did his best to make his greeting sound hearty , ordered a good supper sent up and asked for news of home . Everything was about as usual , John assured him , doing full justice to the excellent meal which was promptly set before him . But " The King of Games " 283Paul was very much missed , especially by his mother . Had he set a definite date for going home ? " Did you come all the way to Paris just to tell me that and ask me that ? " " No , of course not . I came to see about getting an apartment which Malvina and I can use as a permanent pied-a-terre abroad . We 've had only temporary ones before . But it 's evident that I need to be here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orleans and not Paris is the place for you . " " I hope you found something satisfactory ? " Paul inquired , trying to keep the growing irritation out of his voice . " Yes , quite so . A rez-de-chausee , on the rue du Cirque , between the Faubourg St. Honore and the Champs Elysees . I 'd have preferred something on the first floor , but there 's a prospect that there may be a vacancy before long and , if there is , I 'm to have the first chance at it . However , as I was saying " " Look here , John , " Paul interrupted , " I know Mother wants to see me and , as far as that goes , I want to see her . But I have a special reason for staying in Paris right now . " " Really ! Would it be indiscreet to ask what the reason is ? " " Not only indiscreet , but impertinent . However , since I know you wo n't leave me in peace until I tell you , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be guilty of a breach of confidence in doing so . But " " Good grief , Paul , do n't get so hot under the collar ! This is February . You 've been abroad since June , living entirely on family funds , which are n't as plentiful as they once were . Of course , it 's very high-minded of you , insisting that you wo n't play chess professionally ; but if you 're not careful , you 'll exhaust your patrimony faster than you expect . " " I 'm proposing to start earning my own living very soon now . I 've a special incentive for doing so . I 'm not supposed to mention this , because there 's been no official betrothal yet . But I 'm engaged to be married . " " The hell you are ! Is the lucky young lady 's name a secret , too ? " " Yes , for the time being . She 's been obliged to leave Paris temporarily , because of her mother 's serious illness . I promised to wait until she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our marriage then . " " Well , congratulations ! I 'm glad to know you 've come to your senses . The last I heard from you on the subject was several years ago , when both your mother and father were up in arms because you swore you would never marry anyone but that Yankee shopkeeper 's daughter ! A blonde bitch if I ever saw one ! Talk about our dear cousin Natalie Benjaminwhy , Charmian Sheppard could give her cards and spades ! " Paul sprang from the table , trembling with rage . " Get out of here284 The Chess Playersbefore I throw you out ! " he shouted . " And do n't come back , to tell me what I ought to do and how much I ought to spend and then go on to insult my fiancee and her family . Maybe you 've forgotten , but I have n't , that my father and mother did everything they could to prevent my sister Malvina from marrying you ! You never could have done it , either , if Benjamin had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And whatever you choose to say about Natalie , it was she who invited Malvina to stay with her in Paris when she first came here and made it possible for you to be with her . But I 've never lowered myself by calling you a son of a bitch on that account , never until today ! And let me tell you , you miserable bastard , that Albert Sheppard 's a merchant prince , just as the Medicis were merchant princes , and that he 's welcome in noble houses in Paris , where you 've never got your foot inside the door and never will . His wife 's a saint on earth if there ever was one , and I only hope she is n't headed for heaven before her time ! As for their daughters , they 're both pure and beautiful as angels and if you ever say anything to the contrary again , I 'll kill you , do you hear ? I might even do it now , if you do n't get out quickly . " The aftermath of this regrettable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long apologetic letter to Paul , saying that , of course , he never dreamed , when he spoke of the Sheppardsas he did , that Charmian was Paul 's fiancee , or indeed that the old friendship had been renewed . Of course , the stories he had heard must all have been inspired by jealousy , because Albert Sheppard was so immensely rich and Charrnian so beautiful , and because of their entree into an exclusive society which outsiders almost never penetrated . He understood Paul 's resentment of malicious gossip and could not begin to say how sorry he was he had listened to it , much less repeated it . Of course , it was true that he had not been considered good enough for Malvina and no wonder ; it would have been hard enough to find any man good enough for her . But Paul was a different sort , he was worthy of anyone , even of an angel , and John was sure that Paul had been right to describe Charmian in that way . The letter was torn into bits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succession followed the same fate . Finally , John succeeded in waylaying Paul in the lobby , where the outraged suitor could not make a scene , and following him upstairs , meantime vehemently apologizing and explaining . It was while he was thus pleading his cause that the concierge rapped loudly and handed Paul a letter of quite different character : postmarked Nice , marked urgente and heavily bordered in black . " The King of Games " 285He knew before he opened it what was in it and he felt sure the sad news would be broken to him by Berenice . Charmian , poor strickenchild , would not be calm enough to write ; her weeping would be uncontrollable , And Albert Sheppard would be too unbelieving , too stunned , too broken ; this was the sort of thing that happened to other peoplewives of paupers and weaklings , not the wives of rich powerful men who lapped them in luxury and wrapped them in cotton wool . But Berenice would remain calm and competent ; the only tears she wouldshed would be in secret and her hand would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dear Paul " ( she wrote in a firm clear hand ) " I am writing to tell you that Mama died early this morning . The end came very quickly and painlessly . Her tired heart just stopped beating . " I think she expected this because , though she had never talked much about death , she told Papa a week or so ago that she wanted to be buried in Boston and , of course , we all want to follow her wishes . We are very fortunate in having Jacques d'Ambres with us at this time , because he is in a position to cut through a good deal of red tape , which sometimes makes it difficult to take an American home for burial . Final arrangements have not yet been made , but we shall go by the quickest possible route to the nearest port where we can get trans-Atlantic passage . " I know you will want to be with us in our bereavement , but I must ask you to believe that it would be better if you did not try to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and there is bound to be a certain amount of confusion , no matter how well everything is handled . The presence of an extra personeven a close friend we value as much as we do youwould inevitably add to this . I hope you will not take amiss what I am saying . It is not meant to be unkind . " When we get back to Boston , we shall go to our old house on Beacon Hill and stay there for the present . If anything brings you north , after you return to the United States , please let us know . When we are over the first shock of our grief and have resumed an ordered way of living , you will be welcome in our home , as you always have been . " Charmian sends you her love . She says she is sure you will understand why she is not writing herself . And I am sure Fred will understand why I do not write a separate letter to him . " Faithfully and affectionately yours , " Berenice Sheppard . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter to John . " I 'm ready to start back to New Orleans whenever you like , " he said quietly . Afterward , he found that he thought of that spring largely in terms of banquets for which he had no heart , tributes to which he found it difficult to respond and gifts which he had no inclination to use . Of course , there were intervals between these . There were the weeks286 The Chess Playersof congenial work in London with LOwenthal , though these were darkenedbecause this period also marked the time of his parting with Edge , who was remaining in England , at least for the time being . There was the crossingas usual , a nightmare and doubly so because of his longing for his friendon the Persia from Liverpool to New York ; there was the renewal of good companionship when he reached his own shores , none of which compensated for the loss of the one that meant most to him . But the impressions these experiences made on him were less lasting than the seemingly endless dinners , the still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . First came the banquet at the Regence . He learned , just in time to avert this , of a plan for a monster tournament of a hundred players , divided into five classes , from which the five winners would meet him in a final pool , all receiving odds from him . As originally scheduled , the farewell dinner was to follow this tournament , but the project was so far modified as to permit one without the other . However , before the evening was over , the bust by Lequesne was unveiled and crowned with laurel by St. Amant . Then bust and crown were presented to him with due ceremony . In London , there was not an isolated banquet , but a series of ovations , in which chess became a mere accessory to personal compliments . He dined at the London Chess Club with a special group , at the St. George 's with Lord Cremorne in the chair , at the new St. James 's , of which his friend Lowenthal was secretary . He gave another blindfold performance , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at which he was not blindfolded , but played five games simultaneously and scored a brilliant success . And finally , declining dozens of invitations to similar functions , he escaped , actually glad for once that he was going to sea . He had hardly stepped off the ship in New York when the banquets began again . There was one in his honor that same night at the MetropolitanHotel ; the Union Club bestowed a silver wreath upon him ; and then there was a great assembly in the chapel of the University and he was presented with a chess set , whose squares were ebony and motherof-pearland whose men were gold and silver . On the same occasion he was given a gold watch , in which jeweled chess pieces took the place of numerals and his initials were picked out on the back in gems , while the stem was surmounted by a coronet studded with diamonds . At last these ceremonials were over and no more wreaths , no more costly gifts were forthcoming in New York . To be sure , there was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward without dread . For it was to be in Boston and in Boston , banquet or no banquet , he would be reunited with Charmian. 27 . The day was warm for a New England May , and many of the passengers in the steam cars had insisted upon opening the windows , thereby letting in not only a breeze , but smoke and cinders . Normally , the trip from New York to Boston took only about nine hours ; but a hotbox had caused a long delay , and it was very late at night when the train finally pulled in at the Boston and Albany Depot . Paul was not only thoroughly exhausted , he was thoroughly out of sorts . He had been futilely trying , for hours , to flick ashes from the clothes which had been immaculate when he left New York and , intermittently , mopping his moist face with his fine linen handkerchief ; this was now black and so were his hands . The bags , containing his trophies as well as his clothes , were so heavy that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much less carry them with any degree of ease the length of the aisle and down the steps to the station platform . But just as he reached this , laboriously , a watchful figure detached itself from the waiting crowd and hastened forward to meet him . " Paul ! I 'd have known you anywhere ! Do n't you remember me ? I 'm Oliver Shaw and this is Stephen . " Edward 's classmate from Boston , who had been graduated with him , and Oliver 's younger brother , who had remained at Spring Hill only one year ! The New Englanders who had seemed so alien to the southern atmosphere of the college ! Paul had not seen them or heard from them in years and had never expected to do so again . Yet here they were , a welcoming committee of two , on a dimly lit wooden platform in the dead of night . " Of course , I remember you , " Paul said truthfully and thankfully , as he shook hands . He never forgot a face any more than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would have found it hard to recognizehis most intimate friend ; and , besides , he had been taken entirely by surprise . It had never occurred to him that an old college mate would be on hand to welcome him at such an unseasonable hour . There had been no mention of Oliver or Stephen in any of the communications urging him to visit Boston ; of that he felt quite sure ; and his long-lost acquaintances did not instantly clarify matters , though their cordiality was unquestionable . " Here , let me help you with those grips , " Oliver was saying . " Father promised our coachman the evening off , to go to a family wedding , " The King of Games " 289before we knew you were coming . But I 've got a hack waiting outside . We 'll have you home in no time . " " I believe I 'm to go to the Revere House . " " Nonsense ! You 're to do nothing of the kind . The minute we heard you were coming , I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my cousin Lemuel Shawhe 's the Chief Justice of Massachusetts , " Oliver said casually . " One of the bigwigs who 's arranging the dinner for you tomorrow night . Oh , they 'll all be therepoliticians , professors , poets , what have you ! But , meanwhile , we 're going to see that you have a good drink and a good sleep tonight and we 'll stand over you like dragons tomorrow morning . Otherwise , your admirers will be pounding on your door at six A.M. and sticking to you like leeches . " Paul was too tired and too grateful for anything except silent assent to the suggestions made by the brothers . He walked wearily along beside his rescuers , down the platform and through the dingy station and sank into the waiting hack with undisguised relief . As they rattled along over the pavements , Oliver gave a glowing account , frequently interrupted by Stephen , of the profound impression made in Boston by the news of Paul 's reception in Europe and New York , while the latter answered only in polite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steep ascent which he realized , from what he had previouslylearned of the city , must be Beacon Hill , he roused himself sufficiently to ask a question . " Do you happen to know a family named Sheppard ? " " Several of them . Which one do you mean ? " " The father of the family is a Mr. Albert Sheppard . He has two daughtersBerenice and Charmian . " " Oh ! " Oliver glanced at Stephen and something in his tone struck Paul as slightly unnatural , though he could not have told just what it was . " I do n't know them personally , but of course I know who they are . As a matter of fact , they live not very far from us , when they 're home , which is n't often . I believe they 're in Boston now though . " " Yes , I 'm quite sure they are . Mrs. Sheppard died in southern France , late in the winter , and Mr. Sheppard brought herher body home for burial at Mount Auburn Cemetery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like very much to call on him and the girls as soon as I can . " " Then write a note the minute you 're thoroughly awake in the morning and I 'll send it around . Of course , everyone wants to entertain you . You 'd better get in your call before you 're swamped . " " Yes , I mean to . In fact , I do n't intend to be swamped ' to such a degree that I ca n't call often on the Sheppards. " 290 The Chess Players " Of course , you must do just as you please . " Again , Oliver 's voice did not sound quite natural . " Well , here we are . I. 'm afraid everyone else in the family has gone to bed , and I told Saunders , our butler , not to wait up , either . I was sure Stephen and I could manage to make you comfortable . " He dismissed the hack , picked up the heavy bags again and , taking out a latchkey , opened the door flanked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for so elegant and spacious a house . A graceful staircase curved upward from the center of an immense square hall , whose walls were covered with the handsomest landscape paper he had ever seen ; and the incidental furniture , mirrors and paintings with which this foyer was adorned were equally imposing . The lights were turned low in the rooms on either side , but he could catch glimpses of rich rugs and upholstery , more mirrors , more paintings and quantities of books . Oliver , noticing his surprised and admiring glances , shook his head . " You 'll have plenty of time to see the family treasures tomorrow , " he said . " I know you 're dead on your feet . Come on up to bed . You 've got two flights to go , I 'm sorry to say . " The room into which Paul was finally ushered dwarfed all the chambersin the Morphys ' Royal Street house , his own included , and he had always thought those commodious in the extreme . It was permeated with a sweet smell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blossoms , such as rose from his courtyard at home , but the fresh delicate fragrance of lilacs and the spicy odor of clove pinks , which stood here and there in clear glass vases . Warm as the day had been , the night was cool , and a coal fire in an open hearth shed a welcomewarmth and radiance on its surroundings . Drawn close to it was a chintz-covered wing chair , facing a table on which two decanters , one of white wine and one of red , were set out , together with a pitcher of milk , bread and butter , cheese , fruit and a large frosted cake . Beyond , a well-appointed desk stood open and between the windows was a bookcasebulging with volumes bound in half calf . The bed , hung with chintz which matched the covering on the chair and the window curtains , was invitingly turned down . Everything bespoke comfort and friendliness . " Our room is just across the hall , so if you want anything , do n't hesitate to call us , " Oliver said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Otherwise , we wo n't disturb you until we hear from you . Then we 'll get your note out as soon as it 's written . We eat big breakfasts in this part of the world , but I know you like a light one and you can have it any time you choose . Good night and good luck ! " Paul awoke to the soothing sound of gentle rain and , glancing at his " The King of Games " 291magnificent new watch , saw with horror that it was nearly one o'clock . He sprang up , snatched the dressing gown he had not bothered to unpack the night before and put it on , then went straight to the desk , where he dashed off a note to Charmian , asking if he might come and see her that afternoon . Not until he had signed and sealed it did he open the door . The one to the room opposite was also open , and Oliver was sitting near it , a newspaper in his hand , but his attitude one of watchful attention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mother was beginning to be afraid you 'd died in your sleep , so about an hour ago I peeked in on you , very cautiously , and you were slumbering like a baby . So I told her not to worry , you 'd probably wake up in time for lunch . Is that the note you want sent out ? Give it to me , I 'll see that it goes right away . And you 'd like some coffee , would n't you , while you 're dressing ? Saunders will bring it to you and fix the fire . You 'll need hot water , too , of course . And you might like to have a look at last night 's Transcript . There 's a screed saying what a great man you are and an advance notice about the dinner . I hope you like poetry . Mr. Longfellow and Mr. Lowell have both written some on purpose for the occasionMr . Longfellow 's is likely to be a little on the sentimental side . But Dr. Holmes is going to be the toastmaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspaper and glanced through it , with pardonable satisfaction , as he waited for the promised coffee . It was not as good as he would have had at home , but it was better than any he had found in England or France , the cream that came with it was so thick that he could hardly pour it , and the muffins , butter and marmalade that supplementedit were all so delicious that he consumed everything in sight , disregarding the fact that he would soon be expected to eat a hearty meal with the assembled Shaw family . There was a foot tub beside a washstand , both of which had been hidden by an Oriental screen that was now drawn aside , and a plentiful supply of hot water was unobtrusivelybrought in while he was devouring his breakfast . When he looked around , he saw that the coal fire was burning brightly again and that a manservant was picking up the clothes which he had dropped haphazardly the night before and carefully unpacking those which were still in the bags . " Will that be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked as he approachedPaul and took the tray . " Yes , thank you very much . " The man bowed , deferentially . " Mrs. Shaw asked me to tell you that when you were ready , she would like very much to welcome you , sir . She 's waiting in the library to receive you . Unfortunately , Mr. Shaw292 The Chess Playerswas obliged to remain at his office , but Mr. Oliver and Mr. Stephen have been excused from there for the day , in order to be at your disposal . And , of course , you have only to ring if you should require further services from me , sir . " Decidedly , this was rather like being back in London even to the rain , except that here his hosts created a warmer atmosphere of friendlinessthan any of the persons Paul had visited in England . He bathed and dressed without the feeling that he would be made uncomfortable because he had upset the regular routine of the household and , when he opened his door a second time , found that Stephen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not lose his way when he went to the library . " It was perhaps just as well for , unguided , he would have gone straight on to the ground floor ; brief as his glimpse of the rooms on either side of the entrance hall had been , he had certainly seen books there . But these , apparently , were considered quite incidental . The librarywas on the second floor , stretching across the entire width of the great house and , except for the wainscoted space over the mantel , where a fine portrait hung , it was completely booklined . Paul had never seen so many in any private house before , and was faintly surprised that they did not seem more overpowering . But again the cordiality of the atmosphere , the rich coloring of draperies and upholstery , and the prevalence of fresh flowers relieved any impression of the ponderous . A handsome elderly gentleman advanced with an outstretched hand , and a middleagedlady , with a pleasant intelligent face , looked up from her needleworkwith a bright smile . " Welcome to Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the elderly gentleman added quickly , " I 'm Lemuel Shaw , and this is my cousin Anna , the mother of your former college mates and , incidentally , of four other sons whom you 'll meet latertwo are at the Boston Latin School and two are at Harvard . " Paul , realizing for the first time that he had kept not only the immediate family , but the Chief Justice of the state waiting while he dallied , flushed with embarrassment ; but no one else seemed to feel any , and the Justice continued amiably , " Their father is very sorry that he was detained at the office , but he 'll be seeing you tonightas I shall . Unfortunately , though I could slip away from court for a few minutes , I ca n't stay for luncheon with you . However , Anna is going to give us all some sherry now . Meanwhile , perhaps you would let me have the pleasure of talking with you in French , since I do not have many opportunities to converse in that beautiful language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mistaken , it really seems more like a native tongue to you than English which , nevertheless , you speak perfectly . " " The King of Gaines " 293 " You 're not mistaken , sirthat is , I 'm afraid I do n't speak perfect English , but it is true that most Creoles still prefer to speak French among themselves , or sometimes Spanish . At our house , it was about half and half , until my father died , because he preferred Spanish . Now it 's French , my grandparents ' and my mother 's language . " " Ah ! Then you have had the great advantage of growing up trilingual . I envy you . I was fortunate enough to learn French from a distinguished refugee , Antoine Jay , who , after his return to his native country , founded the Constitutional . Since then , I have done a good deal of translation for local papersa pleasant avocation . " " Lemuel , why do you say you do not have any opportunities to speak French ? You know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as often as you like ! " " Yes , of courseand be understood and answered intelligently . Still , Anna , you will admit it does not come as naturally to us as to our gifted guest . " Oliver , who had been standing by one of the long windows , came forward while his uncle was speaking and took Paul 's arm as the latter , no longer suffering from chagrin , responded to the Chief Justice 's friendly overtures and Mrs. Shaw 's smiling seconds to these . She now poured sherry into small glasses from a decanter even more elegant than those which had been placed in Paul 's room , meanwhile talking easily in very creditable French of inconsequential things until Saunders appeared in the doorway to announce luncheon . Then she rose and , biddingher cousin good-bye , took Paul 's arm . " We thought , since you are going to such a large dinner tonight , that you would rather have a quiet luncheon , " she said , reverting to English . " And a simple one , because I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really formidable banquet . We want you to enjoy every minute of your stay in Boston , and I 'm afraid you would not do so , if we surfeited you with food the first day ! But perhaps you would like to take a walk this afternoon , to see something of the Hill and the Common at least . Then we can plan more extensively for tomorrow . " " It 's very kind of you . But if I may , I 'd like to wait until I get an answer to a note I sent this morning to some old friends , before I go out at all , or make any definite engagements . " " Why , of course ! The boys did n't say you had other friends here . They 're probably friends of ours , too . If I 'd known , I would have invitedthem to tea . Why did n't you tell me , Oliver ? " " I did n't think . I should have , of course , because they 've spent a good deal of time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the girls went there for their vacations sometimes . And then294 The Chess Playersthey 've been abroad a good deal . You must have seen them in London and Paris , too , did n't you , Paul ? " " I just missed them in London . But I did see them in Paris , before they went to the Riviera for Mrs. Sheppard 's health . It 's very sad thatthey did n't go sooner ; if they had , she might have recovered . " " These are the Albert Sheppards to whom you are referring ? " " Yesyou do n't know them ? " " Not personally . But , as Oliver says , they 've been away from Boston a great deal . And now , of course , the girls and their father are in mourning . I 'm afraid they 're not going out , socially , at all , or receiving strangers . But naturally that would n't prevent you , as an old friend , from calling . It would only be a proper courtesy on your part . " Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul thought he detected a difference in tone when there was a reference to the Sheppards . But though it puzzled him a little , it did not depress him . He and his hosts had now reached the dining room , which was furnished in massive mahogany . Brightly polished silver shone on the huge sideboardand the capacious table ; the china was blue Cantonware , the glass Waterford , the linen heavily monogrammed and , again , there were fragrant flowers in evidence , this time tastefully arranged in a low central bowl . Paul was increasingly impressed by Mrs. Shaw ; she was very simply dressed , in a dark silk dress with no ornaments of any kind , but it did not seem to require these ; and the plain way in which her abundant hair was braided around her head gave the effect of a coronet . The " simple " lunch was very substantial : a fish with which Paul was not familiar , and which was identified to him as scrod , or young cod , delicately broiled and buttered , was served with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next came lamb chops , fresh green asparagus on toast , baked potatoes and light homemade rolls ; and a rich pudding , to which the Shaws referred as Brown Betty , whose toothsome ingredients no one seemed to feel it necessary to enumerate , brought the meal to an end . Despite the lavish table set by the Sheppardsin New Orleans , Paul had somehow gathered that Bostonians ' everyday meals , when they were at home , consisted of " boiled dinners " or baked beans and brown bread , the very sounds of which were unappetizing ; the delicious fare set before him was as much of a surprise as the impeccable service and the luxurious surroundings . The conversationrevealed a courteous and genuine , but incurious , interest regardinghis experiences in London , Paris and New York . For the rest , it centered chiefly on music , in which it appeared Oliver was deeply interested , and , more briefly , on books , the China trade and national affairs , with such tactful avoidance of the slavery issue that Paul did not " The King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them . The Chief Justice had refused , a few years earlier , to release Sims , a famous fugitive , on habeas corpus , because he felt bound by the Constitution and the law ; though , considering his personal views , his stand had required great integrity and courage in the face of widespread denunciations among his friends and alarming expressions of mob violence . His feelings had never changed and his decision had caused him lasting grief . In other company , he might have made some references to the case ; but Anna Shaw knew she could trust him to be silent . However , she had refrained from inviting another young relative , Robert Gould Shaw , to meet him , because she knew Bob could not be kept off the subject . But they did mention the Honorable John Slidell , with generous recognition of his talents and of the tremendous influence he exerted in the Senate , now that he had succeeded in his adroit and outspoken campaign for Buchanan . " You know him , I am sure , " Mrs. Shaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she carefully measured tea leaves from a silver caddy to a heated pot , which she filled from a silver kettle boiling over a small flaming wick . " Indeed , I believe he married a Louisianian , did n't he ? " " Yes , we know himmy father and he were good friends . And yes , he did marry a Louisianian , Mathilde Deslonde , one of four beautiful sisters . " Paul thought , with poignancy , of his conversation with Judge Morphy on this subject and tried to dismiss it from his mind by speakingof something pleasanter . " According to my mother 's letters , another friend of ours , Pierre Beauregard , is courting Caroline , one of Mathilde 's younger sisters . Everyone wishes him luck . His first wife died soon after he returned from the Mexican War , and it 's taken him a long while to recover from her loss . He 's a wonderful person and deserves all the happiness he can get . " " He 'd acquire a very powerful brother-in-law in the Senator if his suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had begun to pour amber-colored tea into unbelievably delicate cups , doing so with the almost reverent care she would have given a solemn rite . " Yes . But Pierre does n't need John Slidell to make him important to us . He 's our greatest hero , both as a man and a soldier . He has and is everything we admire most . " Paul launched into the extravagant praise that Pierre Beauregard 's name nearly always evoked among his fellow Creoles and the Shaws listened with polite interest . The Sheppards were not mentioned again . But as Mrs. Shaw gave the signal to leave the table , Oliver told Paul that Morton , the coachman , had been instructed to wait for an answer to his note and bring this back with him ; however , none had arrivedp296when they returned to the library and , finally , Saunders appeared to say that Morton had returned empty handed . The young ladies and their father were out , the Sheppards ' cook had told him ; she would see that Miss Charmian got the note as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring the answer herself ; after all , Saunders said with a touch of condescension , the cook was a good-natured Irishwoman and it was just a step between the two houses . As a matter of fact , it was a couple of blocks ; however , the distance could be covered in a very short time , and Paul declined to go out , even for the constitutional which the Shaws seemed to regard as an essential part of their day 's program . He was confident that , at any minute , the hoped-for summons would arrive ; but the time came when he could no longer delay his preparations for the dinner at the Revere House , and he was almost frantic with impatience . At last , when he had practically decided to go unannouncedand ring the Sheppards ' doorbell himself , Saunders knocked at his door and held out a silver salver , on which reposed a small blackedgedenvelope . Paul seized this and tore it open eagerly . " Dear Paul , " he read and instantly , before even looking at the signature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written . His disappointment was like a sharp thrust through his heart , but he tried to ignore this as he read on . " I am sorry that we were not in when your note came and that we were so late getting home that Charmian had to hurry to dress for another engagement , so she did not have time to answer you herself . But she has asked me to tell you that she will be glad to see you tomorrow afternoon about four . I do n't need to add that I shall be delighted , too . " We congratulate you on all the new honors that you are getting and want to hear more about them . Of course , we shall be especially interested in a firsthand account of the banquet tonight , but we hope you will also bring some of the many trophies you have won and show them to us when you come to see us . " Papa joins me in kindest regards and I know Charmian would want me to add hers , though , as I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short message . Faithfully yours , Berenice Sheppard . " Well , he tried to say to himself , it would be less than twenty-four hours before he would see Charmian now and , considering how long it seemed since they had been together in Paris , it should not be hard for him to exercise patience . But he could not entirely rid himself of the pain which had followed that first swift stab of disappointment . He was still suffering from it when he left for the Revere House . " The King of Games " 297Briefly , as he entered the large private dining room where his hosts and admirers were gathered , one hundred thirty strong , he managed to forget it . Surely this company , which was not seated until nearly nine o'clock , was as distinguished a one as had ever been assembled in compliment to a young man with only a single claim to distinction , and this unrepresented by any of these scholars and statesmen ! Scanning the titles and names listed opposite the menu on the satin folder placed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awe : the Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Court , the President of Harvard University , His Honor , the Mayor of Boston , Louis Agassiz , Josiah Quincy , Oliver Wendell Holmes , James Russell Lowell , Henry Wadsworth Longfellow .... Paul 's hand trembled with excitement as he laid the folder down again . He managed to respond adequately to the hearty greetings of these important men , all of them much older than himself , nearly all of them bearded and thickset . They were somehow forbidding , not because they lacked friendliness , but because their learning and their fame made them seem overpowering . To be sure , Paul had moved in select social circles all his lifein New Orleans , in New York , in London and in Paris . But these distinguished men were not figures whose standing was dependent on affability or sophistication or birth , much less wealth , or whose legal or political attainments had made them conspicuous , like his father and John Slidell . They were gentlemen of great achievement , not in one isolated field , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poetry by Longfellow was read all over the Englishspeakingworld , he was a famous linguist , and as much at home in Rome and as prominent a figure there as in Boston ; Oliver Wendell Holmes , though a leading physician , found time , despite his enormous practice , to write novels and essays . Agassiz , a Swiss by birth , and now a professor at Harvard , stood pre-eminent as a naturalist . Quincy had made his mark in politics , both local and national , and was only one of the many statesmen his family had given to the country . The longer he considered the roster , the more conscious Paul became of superior forces . Holmes was proposing a toast , a witty one , as Oliver had predicted ; but Quincy struck a note of superior originality in referring to Morphy as greater than Caesar because " he came and , without seeing , conquered " adelicate allusion to Paul 's success at playing chess blindfolded . Longfellow was obliged to leave early , without reading his poem ; but before doing so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( " If agreeable to you , come in the later afternoon , " he said . " I call that the Children 's Hour , but I make time then for guests , too , and they298 The Chess Playersgenerally enjoy meeting my little daughters as well as my wife . " Dr. Holmes voiced his approval of this arrangement : " Exactly what I should have suggested , Henry . That will leave Mr. Morphy free to have breakfast with me and find out that I 'm not too much of an autocrat ! " ) Lowell read his poem most effectively and was enthusiastically applauded . The Chief Justice was cheered when he rose , when he sat down after his speech was over , and at regular intervals during the course of it . As the moment approached when Paul would be obliged to respond to all these tributes , though he also had been cheered again and again , as one laudatory speech followed another , he found himself becoming increasingly nervous . His hands were trembling again when he himself rose ; but the impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefly , along the same lines that he had in New York , with only a passing reference to chess and with a closing salute " to the literary and scientific men of whom Boston is so justly proud , the stars of the first magnitude that adorn the intellectual firmament of the country . " It was over at last . He could go back to that stately , quiet house on Beacon Hill , where he had been made to feel almost like a member of the family , through the kindness of two former college mates with whom he had never even troubled to keep in touch . And tomorrowwhy , it was today , for the feasting and speechmaking had gone on far into the night ! he would see his only love again and , this time , she would become his promised bride as well . His latest letter from his mother had told him not only about Pierre Beauregard 's courtship of Caroline Deslonde ; she had also told him that Edward Morphy 's happy betrothal to Alice Percy would soon be officially announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come home in time for the celebrations that were planned . Oh , he would get there , of course , hard as it would be to tear himself away from Boston ! And after Edward and Alice had been duly toasted , he would propose a toast to his own fiancee . He traversed the short distance between the Shaws ' house and the Sheppards ' as if he were walking on air and not on uneven bricks . The same grim woman who had been " the mainstay of the household staff " in New Orleans admitted him with no more signs of pleasure than she had ever shown , but this did not surprise him ; he was used to her sour looks . The parlor into which she ushered him was handsomely furnished , but it lacked some quality , which Paul could not identify , that every room at the Shaws ' possessed in such abundant measure . Perhaps , he told himself , it was only that there were not so many books around , looking as if they had always belonged there , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 299which also seemed an integral part of the other setting ; or perhaps it was the lack of an immediate sense of welcome . To be sure , the note from Berenice had said " about four " and he had arrived just as the tall clock on the stairway was striking ; possibly he should not have been quite so prompt ... . At last , he heard soft , quick footsteps approaching and rose quickly , with a fast beating heart . But when the long velvet portieres parted , it was Berenice and not Charmian who was disclosed . " I ca n't tell you how glad I am to see you , Paul , " she said earnestly , advancing to take his hand . " And do n't worryCharmian will be here in just a minute , I 'm sure . She 's been delayed again somehow . " Berenice sat down and motioned to a seat beside her . Despite his first touch of disappointment , Paul realized that he was glad to see her , that her simplicity and forthrightness were as appealing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy for his friend , how sad it was that Fred had never succeeded in touching her heart . She had on a plain black dress , with white collar and cuffs , not the deep mourning which she would have worn in New Orleans , but nevertheless suitable for her bereavement ; and Paul noticed with pleasure that the little hair brooch secured the fastening of the lace at her throat , as it had done every time he had seen her during the interval since he had given it to her . " I hear the banquet last night was a great success , " she went on . " Papa rather hoped he would be invited , but of course it was n't possible to include half the men who would have liked to be there and he realized that . Besides , so soon after Mama 's death . . . . While we 're waiting for Charmian , wo n't you show me some of the beautiful things that have been given you ? You did n't forget to bring them , did you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I wear the watch all the time . And I put two of the chessmenone gold and one silverin my pocket . I could n't very well bring the board or the wreath . " He detached the diamond-studded watch from its chain and handed it to her , together with the chessmen . Berenice fingered them with tender care . Then , still holding them , she spoke of her pride in his achievements , her belief that he would go on to greater and greater things . When he questioned her , she said she had no special plans of her own . She doubted if it would be possible for her to go to Mary Lyons ' Seminary after all . She thought she ought to stay with her father . " My aunt , who was here so many years , looking after us while we were in school and Mama was in New Orleans , wanted to go back to Dublin . You could n't blame her . She was born and brought up there and all her best friends lived in that locality ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she stayed untiluntil we were all settled again . " .100 The Chess Players " You must have had a very sad homecoming , " Paul said . His sympathywas genuine and he knew he should have made some such remark before , but his mind had been so full of Charmian ... . " Yes , it was sad . But I 'm thankful Mama did n't have to suffer any more . I 'm afraid she had , more than we realized . But she was very brave . " " You 're brave , too , Berenice . And I 'm sure Charmian is . " " Yes , she 's been wonderful . If it had n't been for her superb spirit , I 'd have given way sometimes . " " You never would have done that ! And besides , you had your father ! " " Yes , I had Papa . I hope I 'll always have him . Anyway , he 'll always have me . " She put it that way because she knows Charmian is going to be marriedright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul said to himselftriumphantly . He tried to feel sorry for Berenice ; he knew for how long she had set her heart on continuing her education . But somehow his sympathy was swallowed in the belief that he knew the reason for her renunciation . He had waited a long time , too ... . Again there was a light step in the hall and , this time , it was accompanied by a rustle of silk . Unquestionably , it must be Charmian now . The portieres parted again and she stood before him , smiling . She , too , was dressed in black , but somehow it did not have the appearance of mourning ; rather , it gave the effect of emphasizing the blonde beauty of her golden hair and dazzling complexion . Her lustrous skirts billowed about her and , as always , the span of her waist seemed the smaller because her hoops were so large and the swell of her bosom so clearly defined . A lace shawl was draped lightly over her shoulders , but , except for this , they were bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delicate tracery . She was not wearing the heart-shaped diamond locket Paul had given her in Paris , to replace the first poor little pendant with the turquoise in the center ; instead beautifully matched pearls encircled her graceful throat and gleamed as they fell in a cascadefrom the rosy lobes of her ears . Well , he told himself quickly , pearls were more appropriate than diamonds just now . And , after all , it did not matter what Charmian wore . She was there ! It was unbelievable , but he had only to stretch out his hand to touch her . And she was more radiant , more desirable than ever ! " Charmian ! " he cried gladly . " Charmian ! " " Yes , Paul , " she said . Her voice was clear and happy , but she did not , as he had anticipated , hold out her arms to receive him . Could it be on account of Berenice ? After all , now that he and Charmian were " The King of Games " 301about to be married , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's presence . She would be his sister as well as Charmian 's ! He went quickly forward with his arms outstretched and did not even see that Berenice was quietly leaving by a side door . " Mon coeur ! " he said . " My darlingat last ! " Charmian did not actually draw away from him , but always before she had met him halfwaymore than halfway ; now she was standing motionless . She was still smiling and there was still that radiance about her , but there was something else that mystified him . " Do n't you want me to kiss you ? " he asked in bewilderment . " Yes , if you want to . But please do n't misunderstand . " " Misunderstand ? " " Yes . Listen , PaulI want to say something before you kiss mebefore I kiss you . We 've had lots of fun together . I like you very much . I'veI 've enjoyed our lovemaking . You can make love very nicely , though sometimes you seem a little backward . But you 're so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all ! But marriage is serious , darling ! " " I know . That 's why I never promised to marry you . " " You never promised " he began . A terrible fear was mounting in him , a fear unlike any he had ever felt before . And then he saw that the smile on Charmian 's face was not loving , but mocking , as he had sometimes fancied , while never allowing himself to believe , before . " I 'm a Yankee , " she said , " a storekeeper 's daughter . Do n't you suppose I know that 's what your people have been calling me all these years ? They think I 'm not good enough for you . Well , it 's the other way around . You 're not good enough for me . What have you ever done but play chess ? Have you ever earned a cent yourself ? Do you ever expect to ? I want a man who amounts to something , a man who 's a success , like my father . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snobbish people , like the ones you 're staying with and who gave you that dinner last night , fawn over you and flatter you ; but when you come right down to it , what does that amount to ? Nothing , absolutely nothing ! " " Charmian , you ca n't mean what you 're saying ! I realize I 'm not worthy of you , no man is , but I 'll try to be ! And you have accepted me asas a sweetheart for years ! You have given me to understand " " I 've just said , I like you as a sweetheart ! You can kiss me if you want to and I 'll kiss back , but I never meant you to understand that kissing andand things like that necessarily meant marriage . Perhaps , you could have married me , if you 'd really tried , if you 'd forgotten yourself , ' as you said once long ago you were afraid you might , and swept me off my feet . But you didn'teither then or later . You wentp302on playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! All you had to do in Paris was to go a little furtherso far I could n't have stopped you if I 'd tried and I would n't have tried very hard . You might have known that . If no one found out , what difference would it have made ? And if anybody had found out , my father would have been the very first to say there 'd have to be a wedding right away . He 'd have stood by me , he 'd have given us all the money we needed , so that we could be comfortable and independent of your family . But it would have taken something like that to make him . And nothing like that has happened . I know now that nothing will . If I had a French marquis for a husband and I have n't decided yet whether I want one or notI might take you for a lover . It could easily be arranged abroad . But I could n't have a lover without too much trouble in Boston or even in New Orleans . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other time , that I 'll never marry a mere chess player ! "  | " Any more stops before Richmond , Conductor ? " " No sir . Seein ' we 're so late , we 're goin ' straight through , leastwise if we ai n't flagged . " " Then let 's hope everyone 's out of flags . " " Could be . On the railroad , that is . Army 's got plenty . The ladies are mighty busy makin ' ' em for the troops . Cuttin ' up their silk dresses and all . " " Yes , I know . " The oil lamp which hung from the dingy ceiling , midway down the dirty aisle , gave only a feeble light . Nevertheless , the conductor could see that the young man who had asked the question , and who now edged slightly toward the window , closing his eyes as he did so , looked weary to the point of exhaustion . His face was white and drawn , even the lips almost colorless , the features pinched ; could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he had n't appeared to be so puny . His clothes were elegant , toowas n't often you saw such smooth broadcloth , such fine linen . As far as that went , you did n't see much broadcloth or linen of any kind these days on the Richmond and PetersburgRailroad . Butternut jackets and homespun grays , bearskin shirts and fringed leggingsthese were the familiar sights ; there were plenty in the car right now . And usually the wearers of such incongruous garmentswere a noisy lot , their loud laughter , coarse oaths and ribald ditties ringing out above the clatter of the train , the jingle of their spurs , the clanking of their swords and the occasional crash of their bottles . Tonight they were quieter than usual ; in one corner a card game was still going on , in another a heated argument over the fitness of Jefferson Davis for the Presidency ; and now and then a group , which had been caroling Lorena , roused itself and again burst into snatches of song . But for the most part , only snoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , as far as the conductor could observe , was spent to the same degree as was this one young elegant . The others were all healthily or drunkenly somnolent , that was all . His curiosity , as well as his interest aroused , the conductor continued to gaze at his peculiar passenger , the only one in the car who had a grimy plush seat to himself . Something about him had discouraged the easy camaraderie of wartime , had made the rough and ready mountaineersavoid him , even if that meant closer quarters elsewhere . Yes , he was a dandy all right , and it was understandable that these sturdyp307rustics should instinctively shun him and even despise him . But he was not only good looking ; there was something actually appealing about his face ; perhaps he would have liked to be friends with the others , if he had known how , or if they had been willing to let him . He might well be closing his eyes , not only because he was tired , but because , having failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want it . And either he had seen better days , or he had been traveling a great distance ; his dove-colored coat was rumpled , his frilled shirt had lost its freshness ; they must have been worn , without change , for some time . Moreover , their style , as well as their condition , suggested that they were not local products . Although it was obvious that their wearer was disinclined for further conversation , the conductor 's curiosity finally overcame his consideration for the traveler 's fatigue . " Come a far piece , have n't you ? " he inquired . The young man half opened his eyes . " Yes , " he said and closed them again . " Memphis , maybe ? " hazarded the conductor . The eyes re-opened , wider this time . They were heavily fringed , very large and very clear ; something about them gave the conductor a great shock . He had expected they would be dull from sleeplessness ; instead , their clarity was disconcerting . He had thought the traveler 's skin looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed his mind . It was the eyes that were gray ; the skin simply blended with them . " Yes , " the young man was repeating . " Yes , I 've come from Memphis somewhere along the line . Or rather , from Grand Junction , just east of there . " He spoke courteously , but rather coolly . " I 've also come from Jackson , from Chattanooga and from Lynchburg , to mention just a few of the places where I 've changed trains since I left home . I believe there have been ten . However , I did n't start from any of them . I 'm not sure I understand why it should interest you so much to know , but since it seems to , I do n't mind telling you that I started from New Orleans . " " New Orleans ? New Orleans , Louisiana ? Why , that 's where old Bory 's from ! " " Old Bory ? You mean General Beauregard ? " " Do n't I just ! That 's what we all call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nearby seat , who had been dozing on the shoulder of the man next to him , also half-asleep , suddenly sat up . " Virginia , eh ? " he inquired belligerently . " You all think that 's the only state there is , do n't you ? Well , let me tell you something : we call him that in Georgia , too , and down Florida way , where my friend here comes from , they call him the same . Virginia ai n't got no patent on nicknames , not as I 've heard . " He rose unsteadily , as if to challenge any such claim , 308 The Chess Playersthen sank drunkenly back in his place . Derisively , several others gave voice to similar sentiments , and two slender young officers , whose smartly tailored uniforms made them conspicuous among their fellow travelers , chanted solemnly : " Flashing , flashing , along the wiresThe glorious news each heart inspires . The war in Charleston was begun , lts smoke obscured the morning sun , As with cannon , mortar and petardWe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last two lines with increasing vehemence ; then they , too , lapsed into silence and the conductor spoke even more excitedly than before . " I shook hands with him myself ! " he told his unwilling listener . " I had him right here in this very car , from Petersburg north , when he come to Richmond from Charleston . " " Mon pauvre Pierre , comme je to plaigns ! " the traveler said under his breath . It would not have mattered if he had spoken aloud and in English ; the conductor was now so intent on talking himself that he was not listening . " I tell you , there 's a hero if there ever was one ! " he exclaimed . " Not just the hero of Fort Sumter , eithera hero any place you 've a mind to put him . You heard what that Georgian said about him and his Florida friend . This war 'll be over by autumn , if old Bory 's given command like he ought to be and will be , when the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I reckon it wo n't be long now . And what I like best about old Bory is that none of this has gone to his headI mean ladies pelting him with flowers and bands playing and crowds shouting for speeches every time the train pulls into a depot ! He just bows and smiles and then draws back and gets one of his friends to speak for him . " " Perhaps he is n't very good at making speeches . " " Do n't you believe it ! Why that man would be good at anything ! But when he got to Richmond , and found a delegationall big shots themselves , you understandon hand to welcome him , and a coach and four drawn up outside , waiting to take him to the Spotswood , what does he do ? He thanks everybody and then says , sort of shy like , that of course all this is a great honor , but it 's completely unexpected and if it 's all the same to these distinguished gentlemen , he 'd rather just take a hack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privacy . Privacy ! There 's modesty for you . . . say , Mister , ai n't you even listenin ' to what I 'm tellin ' you ? " " The Gambit is not Good " 309 " Yes , Im listening . If I were n't so tired , I 'd be very much interested . But I 'm not surprised . I always thought Pierre Beauregard had a keen sense of the dramatic . " " You always thoughtyou mean to say you know him ? " " I 've been a neighbor of his all my life . I 'm on my way to see him now. , , " You 've been a neighbor of his ! Well , I declare . What 's your name , if it 's all right to ask ? " " Quite all right , but I 'm afraid it wo n't mean anything to you : Paul Morphy . " The conductor shook his head . " No , it do n't mean a thing , " he confessed . " No reason why it should , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet you . Anyone that 's a friend of old Bory 's . . . when you see him , tell him what I 've told youthat we all know he can have the Yanks on the run in a couple of months and that we 're countin ' on him to do it . " " All right , I 'll tell him . " " What 's morebut there , I know you 're tired . Maybe you could snatch a nap before we get to Richmond , like the rest of ' em , if I give you a chance . " He laughed good-naturedly and walked on down the aisle . After havingcome so close to fame , in the person of old Bory 's friend , he had no desire to risk an anticlimax by chatting with others , even if he had noticed anyone sufficiently wide-awake for coherent conversation . But , as he strolled away , he glanced back over his shoulder , and saw that Paul Morphy had moved still closer to the window , and that he was gazing out into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resting in his hand . He was absorbed in thought . Perhaps this hideous trip , which had been undertaken on impulse and was at last drawing toward its end , was just another mistake . But that hardly seemed likely . One man could not possibly make so many . The first , and almost fatal one of course , had been based on the assumption that Charmian was as much in love with him as he was with her . He had not doubted , for one single instant , that this was the case , throughout those blissful weeks in Paris . Now that he looked back on them , he could see that he had been living in a fool 's paradise all that time , that she had never told him she returned his devotion , that she had never promised anything ; it was not her fault , but his , that he had taken so much for granted . And when he had gone to her in Boston , it was natural that she should have regarded his self-confidence as presumption . What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his prowess as a chess player represented distinction in a profession , and310 The Chess Playersit was right and proper that she should expect and demand this in her husband . Very well , he would show her that he could achieve it , along lines that she would recognize as valid . After all , he had received his diploma as Bachelor of Law with the same ease that he had earned his previous degree ; he had known the Code Napoleon by heart when he was only nineteen . This , as he now realized , had been a disadvantage ; he could not practice until he was legally of age and in the two years before he reached his majority , he had been rather at loose ends . If he could have gone straight to work , he could have proven the ability which the excellent firm with which he had studied was the first to recognizeand applaud . Under the circumstances , however , he had no choice but to drift , at least temporarily . After that , his father 's sudden death had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the feeling of increased family responsibilities ; both had been about equally disastrous as far as his legal career was concerned ; he did not need to work and he was needed at home . Then those glittering opportunities for travel and triumph had come to him unsought ; was he to blame because he had taken advantage of them ? Certainly , it had not seemed so at the time ; now he thought he knew his second mistake lay in his failure to begin the practice of law on his twenty-first birthday . He had gone to New Orleans from Boston by the quickest possible route and the very day after his arrival had presented himself at the office of Messrs . Rosellus , Hunt , McCabe and Hennen . The senior partner had received him warmly ; but the warmth had cooled as soon as Paul had made his position clear . " My dear boy , you should have come to me more than a year ago . At that time , we had an opening for a junior in the firm . Now the place has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , might n't you ? " " Yes , eventually . But I understood you to say you wanted to start right away . " " I do . It 's very urgent that I should . Do n't you know of any other firm that might have an opening ? " " I ca n't think of one offhand . Of course , 1 'll ask my partners . I 'll also make general inquiries in my circle of acquaintances . But at the moment , I do n't see how I can give you any definite encouragement . " " Then would you advise me to open an office of my own ? " " Of course , there 's no reason why you should n't . You 've every qualification . Except " " Except what , sir ? " " Except that I 'm afraid you would n't have many clients . You see , most people do n't think of you as a lawyer . They think of you "  | " Yes , I know . As a chess player . But they should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I do n't intend to play another game of chess as long as I live . " He spoke with such vehemence that the older man was startled and tried to answer soothingly . " Paul , do n't say that . You come from a family of chess playersboth your grandfathers , your father , your uncle Ernest , your brother Edward . Thanks to them and to you , your friend Charles de Maurian is a good player , too . You are a great chess player -- a world champion . Chess is an ancient and honorable game . You could n't have a better means of diversion and you need diversioneveryone does . But you yourself have been quoted , I believe accurately , as saying that chess never has been and never could be anything but a diversion . You 've allowed it to divert you too long and to the exclusion of other interests . " " That 's why I do n't intend to run the risk of doing so ever again . " " But why should there be any risk ? You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the evenings " " You 've just reminded me , sir , that I 'm likely to have trouble in building up a practice . ' I mean to devote my entire time to itnot just normal working hours , ' but evenings as well . " " All work and no play , ' you know , Paul . " " All right . Then I 'll play occasionally . But not chess . " He had not depended solely on the good offices of Rosellus , Hunt , McCabe and Hennen . He had personally visited every reputable law firm in New Orleans and all those of any distinction in other parts of the state . Everywhere the answer had been the same : there was no opening just then . He searched for quarters that would not be too costly and when he found some that he thought would serve his purpose , he had cards engraved : PAUL MORPHYATTORNEY-AT-LAW , 12 , Exchange Place , Up StairsNew OrleansHe hung out his shingle and doggedly , day after day , kept long working hours and patiently waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had he broken his self-made rule not to play chess . His grandfather had begged him repeatedly to drop by of an evening , as he had so long been in the habit of doing , and while away thep312hours between dinnertime and bedtime with a game . Just as repeatedly , Paul had declined to do so . But , eventually , the old man 's hurt bewildermentat his refusal was too much for him . He went straight from his office to Le Carpentier 's house , delighted the old couple and their forlornspinster of a daughter with his gay talk of Paris and London as they dined ; and then , as if it were still quite the usual thing for him to do , got out the old chessboard . Le Carpentier opened and chose to move Pawn to Queen 's fourth ; Paul replied by making the corresponding move . Le Carpentier 's second move was Queen 's Bishop 's Pawn up one square . Paul reciprocated by advancing his Queen 's Knight 's Pawn up two squares . Le Carpentier , after careful deliberation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King 's third square , and Paul quickly moved his Queen 's Bishop to Queen two . Le Carpentier retaliated with his King 's Bishop to his King 's second square and Paul quickly moved Queen 's Knight to Queen 's Rook 's third square . His grandfather looked at him across the table , amazement in the old eyes that were still shrewd and keen under their beetle brows . Nevertheless , he refrained from speaking , and chose to move on the diagonal his King 's Bishop , letting the piece rest at King 's Castle 's fifth square . Paul 's next was Pawn to Queen 's Knight five and Le Carpentier strengthenedhis Bishop 's position by then placing his Queen on King 's Bishop 's three , sensing all the while that , with two ensuing and consecutive King 's Knight 's movements he would be truly on the offensive . Thereupon Paul threw caution to the wind and played Queen to Bishop 's square . " What 's the matter with you , Paul ? " his grandfather asked roughly . " If I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose . " " You do n't really mean that , do you ? " Paul inquired tranquilly . Without answering , Le Carpentier quickly cancelled out Morphy 's King 's Bishop 's Pawn with a maximum vertical sweep of his Queen . Morphy captured Le Carpentier 's Queen and , in the same move , toppled his King over in defeat with his index finger . Both players realized that Paul 's alternate move of King to Queen square would have been only a short-lived retreat , as Le Carpentier 's next thrust would certainly revolvearound his Queen 's capture of Morphy 's Bishop , next effecting a Queen Bishop checkmate after Paul 's only remaining move of his Bishop to King 's square . Le Carpentier 's open Bishop now sufficed and what should have been a royal battle had developed into a pathetic farce . He pushed back his chair , upsetting the chessmen as he did so . " I 'm not in my dotage yet , even if you think I am , " he said angrily , " I can tell , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away. 0p313I 'm not an object of pity , either . To you or anyone else . You need n't come here again . Hereafter , I 'll play with Charles . " Well , that was months ago and he had not gone again . Le Carpentier was too proud to ask him , once the harsh verdict had been handed down that his favorite grandson was no longer welcome at his house ; and Paul was equally proud ; he would not ask for reinstatement in his grandfather 's good graces . Temperamentally , he was not ill-fitted to live a life of seclusion ; but the role of recluse , as he had always visualized it , was one devoted to the uninterrupted pleasures of the garden and the library and not to unremittinglabor . Nevertheless , he toiled , to no avail , in his second story office , evening after evening , all through the hot summer months . Autumn brought some slight cessation of his voluntary imprisonment , for his brother Edward 's long courtship of Alice Percy culminated in a November wedding , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the happy pair had no sooner departed on their honeymoonthan he was working more intensively than everindeed , so intensivelythat he was at first hardly aware of Secession 's rising tide . The withdrawal of South Carolina from the Union came as no surprise , nor did it immediately spell war in Creole circles . Some New Orleanians celebrated it noisily , some welcomed it as timely , some deplored it as premature , some underestimated its significance . But , coming as it did , at the height of the Christmas season , the more light-hearted continued their celebrations , either feeling or pretending to feel that it did not and could not affect them too closely and too personally . When Mississippi seceded on January 9th , sentiment was very different ; ties between that state and Louisiana were much closer than between South Carolina and Louisiana and these were not based on propinquity alone ; culturally and economically the two had much in common . By the time Florida , Alabamaand Georgia had taken action , in swift succession , everyone knew that Louisiana would be next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had passed the Secession Ordinance reached New Orleans on a fine Saturday afternoon and pandemonium immediately broke loose . The Washington Artillery fired a salute of one hundred guns on the levee and , simultaneously , bells from every church and firehouse began to peal , and the whistles from every steamboat in the harbor began to blow . Even before the first tumult had subsided , Pelican flags were proudly flung out into the breeze from hotels , theaters and other public buildings , and from many private houses as well ; and , with nightfall , brilliant illuminations began . The streets were crowded with people , singing the catchy new songp314called Dixie , and the shouts , " Hurrah for Independent Louisiana ! " were heard on every sidefor , though it had joined other southern states in leaving the Union , it did not immediately enter the new Confederacy , but elected to become an independent republic , functioning under its own flag . Six weeks later it took the almost inevitable step toward affiliation ; but , meanwhile , a second great popular demonstration had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louisiana Club a huge single star , richly colored , was surrounded by innumerable brilliant lamps , and the Pelican Club was similarly lighted . The Pickwick Club , on the other hand , was resplendent with a movable transparency in which the Louisiana coat of arms was displayed in different shades of red ; and , beneath this , in illuminated colors , was blazoned the motto , " Union , Confidence and Justice . " Hotels and commercial establishments vied with private clubs in their elaborate displays , and the Orleans Cadets and the Louisiana Guards were all out on parade . Mardi Gras was even gayerin fact , gayer than it had ever been . Only the day before , the state had adopted " The Flag of Independent Louisiana " and on the morning of Fat Tuesday , it was unfurled at City Hall before a cheering multitude . A day of wild rejoicing followed and , at night , there was a ball in every available hall , while the streets were crowded with hundreds of merrymakers , awaiting the parade of the Mystic Krewe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd knew no bounds . A great arch , hung with lanterns and bearing the Krewe 's name , preceded a transparency captioned The Four Ages of Life . The maskers marched in a column of six groups , flanked by Negroes , carrying a chain of platforms , brilliantly lighted with torches . Childhood , Boyhood , Manhood , Youth and Death were in turn represented with appropriate symbols ; and the Comus Ball which followed the parade was even more glamorous than in preceding years . Without being labeled as a complete spoilsport , Paul had not been able to withdraw completely from the circle of his family and friends during this period . Courteously , if reluctantly , he had joined Alice and Edward , his sister Helene and his friend Charles de Maurian in the festivities which were so integral a part of Creole life ; if only Charmian had been there , he thought , if only he could have seen her delight in such spectacles , he could have shared it ! He had never taken any memberof his family into his confidence regarding his association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealt him in Boston . Now , for some reason he would have found difficult to explain , he mentioned her to his new sister-in-law as casually as he could when he pronounced her name.  | " I do n't see what I add to our group . Now , if there were only another girl " " Why , Paul , there are plenty of other girls ! All you 've got to do is to ask one ! I know a dozen who 'd be overjoyed if you only would . The trouble with you is " " I did n't mean just any girl . I meant Charmian Sheppard . She has so much joie de vivre that it 's impossible to be dull in her company . " He was immediately conscious of that coolness in the air which seemed to chill it whenever Charmian 's name was mentioned . " Are you talking about that Yankee shopkeeper 's daughter who used to come here and try to force her way into society ? " Paul could freeze , too , on occasion . He did so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Perhaps you 've forgotten that you and she were good friends once . You brought her to our house the first time she came there . She did n't force her way in . " " Well , of course children will play with anyone , unless their parents watch out . Mine did watch out . The friendship , as you call it , did n't last long . Charmian just happened to be in my class at school and that did n't last long , either ! Madame Girard found a way of making it clear that her unwelcome pupil would be better off learning her lessons elsewhere ! When it comes to livening things up , you know as well as I do that Charmian would never have been invited to one of our parties , Carnival parties least of all , even before this year . And now ! Have you forgotten that , besides being commercial and cheap and coarse , Yankees are our enemies ? " For a moment he stared at her blankly . Actually , he had forgotten that Charmian must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , he had gone on thinking of her only as his lost love , whom he wouldwhom he mustreclaim . But how was he to reclaim her under existing circumstances ? What Alice said was too trueCharmian was a Yankee ; she was his enemy ; if she had been unwelcome in New Orleans before , her very name was anathema now . She had never written him since that disastrous meeting in Boston ; but from time to time Berenice sent him a chatty little letter and , strangely enough , one arrived to lighten the gloom of Ash Wednesday . She naturally felt very sad , she told Paul , to realize that North and South now seemed to be so irrevocably divided ; but she hoped and believed that , even though their two sections of the country were separated , this would make no difference in such old established friendships as theirs . Her father had decided that , until the " politicians and hotheads " had come to their senses , it would be pleasanter to live abroad , so they were going back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful house they had occupied before , but when they were settled she would let him know . Until he heard from her again , perhaps it would be better if he addressed her in care of the American Legation , with which they would always be in touch . " I 'm sure there is a great deal to be said on the side of the South , " she added in a postscript . " Charmian and I would be glad of any news you feel like sending us . If you see Major Beauregard , please give him our regards . You know how much we have always admired him . " It was , Paul reflected , as he read and reread these last sentences , actually quite a while since he had seen Pierre , at least long enough to have any sort of a talk with him . Of course , they had met at parties , and he personally had not failed to remark the change in the erstwhile brooding widower , which was a matter of such general comment , since the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was happily married to Caroline Deslonde . They were living in the house on Chartres Street which had been built by Paul 's grandfather and with which his own childhood was so closely associated ; it had been loaned them for their honeymoon and then , as the owner wished to spend some months in travel , she had asked them to stay on and they had been glad to do so . Paul had failed to take advantage of several cordial invitations to visit them ; now he decided it might not be a bad idea to sound Pierre out on the question of enlistment , which Paul was turning over in his mind . Numa Augustin , a lifelong friend of the Morphy family , who was by temperament a fire-eater , had promptly formed a battalion known as the Orleans Guards ; nearly all the gilded youth of the city had rushed to join it , and Edward Morphy and Charles de Maurian had been no exception to this rule ; they had been ordered into the service of the State of Louisiana even before this joined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul suggested following their example : with his delicate constitution , he must be mad to think of such a thing ! A little later , when Paul 's cousin , Diego , joined the ConfederateGuards Regiment and became a sergeant in the Louisiana Militia , Paul broached the subject again and Telcide 's protests grew more and more vehement ; she was so close to hysteria that he did not dare oppose her openly . But he could not bring himself to believe that there was not some branch in the service in which he could be useful . It was all too plain by now that he would never be a lawyer ; very well , he would be a soldier ! A dashing officer might very well have more appeal to Chanuian than a dull attorney , even if she did not approve his cause . Pierre could tell him how such a miracle could be brought about . With this in mind , he set out for the house on Chartres Street which he still thought of as his grandfather 's , though it had now changed1p317hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Aloise Merle . He lingered for a few minutes in front of the garden on the corner of Chartres and Ursuline Streets , which an open gate permitted him to view unimpeded , despite the high brick wall which now enclosed it . He had loved the wild iris and lilies , the ferns and ginger plants which his grandfather had brought in from the slave farm in the swamps and which , far from drooping and dying as a result of the transfer , had grown and flourished after transplanting , until they eventually achieved something almost jungle-like in their luxuriance . Moreover , he had shared his grandfather 's conviction that this small tangled park should be left unhedged , so that it might be enjoyed by the entire neighborhood ; and , when the place was sold , he had grieved , not only because it would cease to be a source of family pride and pleasure , but because it would no longer be a source of neighborhood pride and pleasure as well . For a great while , his sensitivity on the subject had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after time had healed his sorrow at separation from it , he was bound to admit that Aloise Merle had also brought beauty to it -- not , to be sure , that untrammeled sylvanbeauty with which Le Carpentier had managed to transfigure a city lot ; but a controlled and ordered beauty which harmonized with its urban setting . A fountain , surmounted by a cherub astride a dolphin , stood in the center and the water flowing from the dolphin 's mouth fell with a soft musical sound into the circular pool at its base . Neat brick walks radiated from this fountain , encircled the four D-shaped flower beds which made part of a formal pattern and followed the brick wall on all four sides of its interior . A magnolia tree rose above each of the four D-shaped flower beds , and a three foot space between the walks and the wall permitted the thriving growth of more flowers , in abundant variety . With the coming of spring , the camellias had lost their last perfect petals ; but some of the roses were already at the height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scent and that of the adjacent tea olive shrubs . Beds of the various herbs , indispensable to Creole cuisine , supplemented the flower beds and fruit trees were espalieredon the walls behind the flowers ; lattices and arbors , overhung with wisteria , brought the garden into logical relation with the orchard beyond it and completed the pleasing design . On this balmy day , when the harmonious whole was bathed in beneficient sunshine , Paul felt his heart go out in sympathy to Aloise ; she , too , must have suffered when bereaved of this place . At the same time , his last nostalgic longing for the miniature jungle was submerged in unreluctant admiration for the charm of her creation , embodied in such florescence and fructification.  |p318Realizing  at last that , if he continued to linger by the open gate , the acceptable time for calling would be past , he turned away and went up the graceful curved staircase leading to the front door . This was opened by a manservant whose erect bearing and general spruceness suggested training by a military master , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had played so many games of chess with his father , his uncle Ernest and his brother Edward . Again , waves of the nostalgia , which , only a few minutes before , he had believed entirely subdued , threatened to overwhelm him ; the room , though elegantly furnished , lacked both the allure with which his mother managed to imbue all her surroundings and the atmosphere of culture which his father had been equally gifted in imparting . He was glad when he heard light footstepsapproaching and realized that his hostess was not going to keep him waiting and that he would lack time to brood over unwelcome changes . He had always liked Caroline , as he had liked every one of the charming Deslonde sisters who , like the famous de la Rondes , were not infrequently called the Muses , though , as a matter of fact , while Captainand Madame Deslonde also had nine children , five of them were sons ! Paul had been too young to attend the famous fancy dress ball at the Mint , given to introduce Rose and Josephine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had created when she appeared at this in the elaborate costume of a French marquise and the success , almost as great , which her three sisters had scored in French peasant dress . All this had been the talk of the town . While Caroline was generally considered less fascinating than Mathilde , who had captivated official Washington when she went there as the wife of John Slidell , then Senator from Louisiana , Caroline , too , was a gracious and accomplishedhostess ; and her reception of Paul was now as courteous and as cordial as he had hoped it might be . But she could not conceal her surprisewhen he asked to see her husband . Surely he must have heard that , after the abrupt termination of his post as Commandant of West Point and his resignation from the Federal Army , Pierre had gone straight to Montgomery , the newly formed capital of the Confederacy , where he had joined President Davis and where he was now awaiting a new commission ! Mr. Slidell and others had recommended him for a Brigadierin the Confederate Army . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was merely marking time until he received assignment for active duty . He did not expect to return to New Orleans meanwhile ; and if he found his absence were to be prolonged , Caroline would not stay on here without him . She did not wish to trespass too long on the kindness of Madame Andry , the hospitable owner of the house , andp319Caroline 's brother-in-law , John Slidell , had very kindly suggested that she and her mother should use his house , on the Esplanade , when it was more convenient for them to be in town than at the Deslonde plantation near Edgard . He and Mathilde were hardly there any more and besides , even when they were , there was plenty of room for all of them . Caroline thought the suggestion represented a generous gesture and the proposed arrangement a logical one . Did n't Paul agree with her ? And would n't he stay for a glass of wine or a cup of coffee on the new gallery ? She did not believe he had been to the house since the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving the house a great deal of welcomeextra space ; he might be interested in seeing the improvements . " When Pierre gets home , " Caroline told him , " we are going to give a big party . We have it all planned . Our guests will enter through the salle de compagnie and Pierre and I will stand to welcome them between the columns which divide this from the ballroom . That , of course , is where they will dance , The orchestra will be in the cabinet at the rear . If it is a pleasant night , which naturally is what we are hoping for , we will also place an orchestra on the gallery of the slave quarters , and there can be dancing in the patio , too . Those who do not wish to dance , or who want a change from dancing , can stroll in the side garden . We will serve lots of champagne and all the usual bonnes bouches : petits pates aux huitres , dragees , masse pain , langues de chat , fruit cakes , great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jellies . " She paused for a moment , as if in anticipated appreciation of such a feast . " Of course , Pierre will wear his full dress uniformhis new Confederate uniform , " she went on , " and I shall wear my wedding dress , changed just a littlefor instance , I will have the lace flounces caught up with pink roses instead of white ones . But there , I know you 're not interested in details like that ! It will be very gala though , do n't you think so ? We shall count on you to come early and stay late . " He did agree that Mr. Slidell 's suggestion was both generous and logical and that the proposed party should , indeed , be a gala occasion . He then thanked her for asking him to remain for coffee , but begged to be excused on the ground that his mother was counting on having him with her at this hour . The plea was a genuine one . Now that Edward had a house of his own , Telcide was increasingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , if he had had no valid reason for departure , he would have been tempted to invent one . He did not want to see any more of the house , which he continued to find full of disturbing memories . It had been bad enough to see the altered salle de compagnie , even without looking past the Corinthian columns which framed it in the rear and alone separated it from the enormous apartment beyond , whichp320had formerly been the banqueting hall on grand occasions and was now obviously only a ballroom . It would be worse still to see this new gallerysupplanting the one where the Le Carpentiers and the Morphys had always taken their pleasant family meals , in fine weather . He knew that any further changes would be unwelcome to him personally , no matter how much they might seem to improve the property . Besides , he felt guiltily conscious , for the first time , that , in his passion for legal achievement , he had lost touch with history in the making , and deeply chagrined because he had not taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He decided to pursue Pierre to Montgomery , as soon as the pitiful little law office could be closed and other personal matters put in order , and acted as swiftly as possible to do this . While he was still occupied with the final details , the glad news came through : Pierre was the proud possessor of the coveted promotion and had been sent to Charleston . After that , one event came crowding closely upon another : he became the hero of Fort Sumter ; he was making a triumphal progress to Richmond ; he was about to receive command of the Army of Northern Virginia ... It was in Richmond that Paul hoped , at last , to make connections with the first hero of the war . He would , he must . And coupled with this was a hope still more daring : since Pierre had become a Brigadier-General , he certainly would require an aide-de-camp . What could be more natural than that he should be glad to grant the request of an old friend who craved the honor of serving him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was with this conviction that Paul had started on his journey . He straightened up in his seat , pulled his coat into place and looked at his watch . The conductor , repeating his ramble down the aisle , stopped again , goggle-eyed . " That 's a might handsome timepiece you 've got there , " he said admiringly . " Do n't know 's I ever saw one like it . " Paul detached it from its chain and handed it to him . The conductor 's gaze wandered from the diamond-studded stem , surmounted by a coronet , and the initials traced in diamonds on the back , to the simulatedchess pieces in red and black which took the place of numerals . He handed the watch back reluctantly . " Ai n't many got anything like that , " he said , shaking his head . " Presentation piece , I reckon ? " " Yes . But it has no magic properties for shortening time on journeys . I wish it did . " " Well , cheer up . It wo n't be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aisle , shaking the somnolent passengers into wakefulness . With varying degrees of reluctance or alacrity , they responded to his summons , reaching for their hats , gathering up their bundles and their firearms ; then they strolled or slouched along toward the door , yawning and exchanging inconsequential remarks . Paul waited for them all to pass him before he took his own hat from the rack , groped under the seat for his neat bag and drew on his gloves . When he finally reached the station platform , there was not a vehicle in sight . " Are n't there any hacks or buses at this depot ? " he asked a shabby man who stood lounging against a post near the curb , apparently with no fixed purpose of going anywhere . " Last one left about two minutes ago . Got snatched up quick when the train come in . It 's always late , but tonight it 's later than common . Everyone was in a hurry to be off . " " Evidently . Is it far to the Spotswood Hotel ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way . Mean to say you 've got a room at the Spotswood ? " " Yes , I wrote for one . " The shabby man laughed , not very mirthfully . " Well , you might get space on a billiard table , if half a dozen ai n't ahead of you there , " he said . " Anyway , I wish you luck . Turn to your left and keep going up Main Street to 8th . This is 14th . " Paul picked up his bag , which had seemed light when he - left home , but which had apparently become heavier every time he changed trains than it was the previous time and which was now a dead weight . Before he arrived at the top of the steep cobblestoned hill , he had been obliged to stop frequently to rest and the jostling crowd made the sidewalk almost impassable . In the lobby of the hotel , conditions were even worse . Large numbers of men , some in uniform , but many in frock coats , were standing in tight little clusters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was trying to pass them , and it was almost impossible to do so . Paul 's face was streaming when at last he reached the desk , where a much harassed clerk was telling one applicant for reservations after another that there was no space in the hotel . Finally , he turned toward Paul . " You heard what I said to all those others , " he remarked wearily . " I could n't get one more man , woman or child into this hotel with a shoehorn . Not even a baby . " " I think you must have a room reserved for me . Paul Morphy of New Orleans . I wrote ahead . " The clerk laughed , as mirthlessly as the lounger at the station . " Mails do n't come through very regularly these days , as I should think you'dp322know , " he said . " Even if they did , that would n't have made any difference . The hotel 's been booked solid for weeks and weeks .... I 'm sorry , " he added more kindly , recognizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who stood before him . " Could you suggest any other hotel that I might try ? It 's important I should find a place to stay . I 've come to see General Beauregard . He 's expecting me . " The clerk glanced toward the clock . " Not at this hour , surely ? " he said with a touch of irony . " Listen , of course , I 'd be glad to do what I could for you , but I told you the truth ; there is n't an inch of space at this hotel or at the Ballard , either . Lots of private houses are taking in people though , and in the morning I mean later in the morning I 'm sure you could get a room , even if you were n't a friend of the General 's . Everyone 's doing their best to take care of strangers . Why do n't you just leave your bag here in the office and find yourself a chair , if you can , in the parlor ? Maybe you could snatch some sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plump , swarthy man , in handsome civilian dress , who was standing near by in one of the tight little groups , turned slightly , looked hard at Paul for a moment and then detached himself from his companions and came forward , his hand outstretched . His beaming face showed no sign of fatigue or uneasiness and he walked with a springing step ; indeed , he appeared to be the personification of prosperity and good cheer . " My dear Paul , " he said in French , " why on earth did n't you write to me instead of to Pierre ? Everything would have been so much simpler then . I always keep a guest room at the disposal of my friends . Surely , you knew that you could count on Cousin Judah ! " 29 . Hardly waiting for Paul to stammer out his surprise and gratitude , Judah Benjamin propelled him , with seemingly effortless speed , through the crowded lobby and entrance ; he smiled and spoke a brief word of greetinghere and there as he went along , but he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he indicated a waiting carriage and motioned Paul to enter it , as a smartly uniformed coachman , alert despite the ungodly hour , sprang from his box and opened the door . " Do n't try to talk , " Benjamin said pleasantly , slipping his arm around Paul 's shoulder . " There is n't time anyway . We 'll be at my house in a matter of minutes and you 'll be abed in as many more . I 'll send a hot toddy and a chicken sandwich up to you . Then sleep as late you like in the morning . There 'll be time enough to discuss your plans when you 're rested and fed . And , of course , you 'll want a bath preparedI seem to remember you 're a great one for baths . But that had better wait until morning , too or rather , until later in the morning ! " It was indeed scarcely more than a " matter of minutes " when the carriage stopped before a large house , hospitably lighted . The curtains of the drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be seen a card table , with tall well-filled glasses standing among its pile of chips . One of the half-dozen young men who were here **25;2278;TOOLONG instantly rose and was already at the door when Benjamin and Paul went up the steps . " Well , Jules ! " Benjamin said genially . " You 'll be glad your game kept you up so late when you see whom I brought home with me ! Our cousin , Paul Morphy ! Imagine not letting us know he was coming to Richmond ! " " Outrageous ! " Jules St. Martin exclaimed , seizing Paul 's bag . " I hope you have n't forgotten your relatives , Paul , now that you 're such a celebrity ! Oh ! of course , Natalie wrote us all about your triumphs in Paris , and you may be sure the story lost nothing in the tellingthanks to Judah 's coaching during their courtship , she 's a wonderful raconteuse ! But come on , it 's bed for you right away , is n't it ? The garden guest room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his head swimming now with bewildermentas well as faintness . Yes , of course he knew that his cousin Natalie was Benjamin 's wife , and that despite her husband 's deep devotion to her , she preferred to live chiefly in Parisin fact , Paul had seen her frequently there . He also knew that Benjamin had accepted this separa- " The Gambit is not Good " 327tion not only without acrimony , but with philosophy and that his relations with all the St. Martins had remained extremely cordial . But he had not heard that Benjamin 's young brother-in-law Jules was actually a member of the former 's household now , or indeed that he had already achieved an ordered and elegant form of living in Richmond . In any case , it would not have occurred to Paul to take the new Attorney General 's hospitality for granted on the basis of relationship ... . " There you are ! " Jules said , setting down the bag on a small mahoganystand . " I 'll see that you have something to eat and drink by the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just drop your clothes on the floor as you take them off . That way , they 'll be laundered and pressed by the time you want to put them on again . " The spring sunshine was pouring into the room when Paul stirred in his comfortable bed and his first real consciousness was of a clock , striking softly and musically . Half-consciously , he began to count the strokes . Twelve ? Impossible ! He must have made a mistake ! But , as he sat up in bed , rubbing the sleep from his eyes , and looked at the mantelpiece , he saw that he had not . The hands of the delicate little French clock which formed part of the garniture de cheminee were indeed pointing to noon and a glance at the " presentation piece " confirmed his fear that it was telling the right time . Before he could rouse himself enough to rise , the door opened softly , and a manservant entered with noiseless footsteps and approached him deferentially . " Ben watchin ' for you to wake this las ' hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husky voice . " But Mr. Benjamin , he say mos ' particular to tell you , take you ' time . He an ' Mr. Jules has gone to they offices , but they be back to dinner , five o'clock . You ' clothes is all ready for you , those you lef ' on the floor , an ' I 'll unpack you ' bag an ' put you ' other things to rights soon 's I 've brought you ' breakfast . Does you want that firs ' or you ' bath ? " This was the same perfection of service in the same type of luxurious surroundings that had so impressed Paul at the Shaw house in Boston ; but this time it had the added warmth and grace peculiar to the South . It was doubly welcome on that account and also because Paul stood even more in need of friendly solicitude than he had before . True , he had been travel worn and weary when he reached Boston ; but then he had been at the very zenith of his career as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and literary leaders of the world , and he had also been a suitor for the hand of his chosen ladylove . Moreover , his hosts had been his former schoolmates , who might reasonably take pride in having the lion of the day as their guest and it was not unnatural328 The Chess Playersthat their family should share this pride . Now he was an unsuccessful lawyer , a rejected lover , an idler when he should have been a soldier ; he was a failure in every sense of the word ; and his rescuer had been a man of renown , much older than himself , and weighted down with the responsibilitiesof high office in the Confederacy . The favor itself was far greater ; the gratitude it inspired correspondingly deeper . Paul breakfasted and bathed at leisure and , clad in raiment once more immaculate , was about to descend and explore the pleasant garden he could see from his window , when the ubiquitous servant , whose name had been disclosed as Rufus , reappeared and handed him a visiting card on a silver salver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. Chisolm , " he read slowly and , glancing up , added , " Tell him I 'll be down immediately . " " Yes , sir . He did say like he hoped you would be . Seems he in a powerful hurry . " Paul hesitated . Of course , it was not customary to question servants . Yet , this time , he felt justified in making an exception to such a rigid rule of etiquette . " You did n't happen to gather what he wanted to see me about , in such a powerful hurry ? " " No , sir . Seems like everyone 's in a hurry these days , ' ceptin ' Mr. Benjamin . He always takes his time , praise the Lord ! " Paul responded to the man 's smile with an answering one and with the agreeable sensation that feverish haste was not necessarily an indication of industry or ability . Indeed , he descended the stairs in a more leisurely manner than he had originally intended . The slim , elegant officer who was pacing up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Morphy ? You have my card , but perhaps my name means nothing to you , as I am not a Louisianian , but a South Carolinian . Permit me to identify myself as General Beauregard 's aide-de-camp . " Pierre 's aide-de-camp ! The post on which Paul himself had set his heart ! So he had made still another mistake ! But with the swift stab of disappointment came the wholesome awareness that his hope had not necessarily been ill-founded . While sound sense should have told him that Pierre would have needed an aide-de-camp long before this , there was , after all , no reason to take it for granted that he would not eventuallyneed more than one , or that the present incumbent could continue indefinitely to give satisfaction . Paul was not favorably impressed with his visitor and hoped that jealousy alone was not responsible for the fact that he found the Colonel 's manner lacking in graciousness . " I fear I owe you an apology . Your letter to the General was over- " The Gambit is not Good " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not convey as much regret as Paul would have felt under the same circumstances . " Of course , it is necessary for me to screen his correspondence , which , as you can appreciate , is enormous . And , as you will remember , you wrote in French , which does not happen to be one of the languages I read with the greatest ease . " The inference that there were many others which he did read with ease was not lost on Paul , who could not suppress a doubt as to whether or not this were really so ; wisely , he did suppress the impulse to say he was sorry he had not written in Spanish , Latin or Greek , which he might well have done . " I therefore put your communicationaside , " the Colonel went on glibly , " until I could show it to the General at his convenience , and several days passed in which I had no opportunity to talk with him about anything but military matters . Meanwhile , you arrived in Richmond . " Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Richmondhad been inopportune . " This morning , the Attorney General called on General Beauregard and asked if the latter had not heard from you , " Colonel Chisolm was now saying . " I explained that your letter had been duly received , but that , like dozens of others , it was still awaiting attention . The Attorney General displayed astonishment that there should be such a delay with correspondencean astonishment which , I confess , I find it hard to understand , though probably he can command more clerical help than General Beauregard ; he seems to be very adroit about getting whatever he wants . " This time , there was a definite sneer in the voice , which Paul found it hard to disregard ; but again he recognized the wisdom of silence and the Colonel hurried on . " To make a long story short , General Beauregard has now read your letter and would be glad to see you at once , if you would care to accompany me to his office . Of course , it is to be hoped that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands upon his time . " " Did Pierre say that ? " Paul asked quietly . " That he hoped you would make your call brief ? Why no , not in so many words . But I thought it best to caution you . I 'm sure no stranger to the Richmond scene can possibly realize " " Thank you . I felt I must ask , because , if you had been quoting Pierre correctly , I should have felt I must decline to accompany you . I would have preferred not to take advantage of his friendship . As it is , I shall be glad to accept his invitation . " On the brief ride between the Attorney General 's house and the hotel , Paul was the more at ease of the two ; he commented casually on
