txt William H. , a 41-yearold Auburn lawyer , won unanimous backing last night from Mayor Wagner and key Democratic leaders in the state that assures him of election as Democratic state chairman . The Democratic State Committee will meet under special call Thursday afternoon at the Biltmore Hotel to oust Michael H. Prendergast as chairman and to choose a successor . The leaders who committed themselves to Mr. in a two-and-a-half-hour meeting at Gracie Mansion represented a dozen counties that cast 167 of the 300 votes on the state committee . And leaders present , coming from points as remote as Erie and Nassau , Albany and Broome , could speak with reasonable authority for state // committee members in two dozen more counties casting perhaps as many as forty additional votes . Mayor Wagner , who called the meeting , said in announcing the results that Mr. , the party leader in Cayuga County , was assured of election by " well over a majority of the State Committee . " Asked if Mr. might muster a two-thirds vote , the Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. had assured leaders supporting him that he would , if elected , quickly name a committee to propose state rules changes " to make them more democratic along lines we have urged . " The Mayor reported that'both former Senator Herbert H. Lehman , ' leader of the party 's reform wing , and former Postmaster General James A. Farley had expressed the view that Mr. would make a good state chairman . Mr. Wagner suggested this was also the view of Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt . Mr. said the 1962 state campaign would begin " the day after my election . " He and the Mayor had met on Staten Island in the late afternoon for a talk before going on , an hour and a half late , to the Grade Mansion meeting , scheduled for 4:30 P , M. From other sources , it was learned the Mayor had " the votes in hand " to assure the election of Edward N. Costikyan , an East Side district leader , as the new party leader in New York County . The Democratic County Executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new leader . The post of chairman of the full 3,500-member County Committee , it was understood , will go to J. Raymond Jones , Harlem leader , who has vied with Mr. Costikyan and John T. Harrington , the reform candidate , for the leadership .. Reform Democrats still are committed to Mr. Harrington , but they lack a majority on the Executive Committee . There are a total of sixteen votes , cast in fractions that run down to a ' sixth of a vote . Mr. Harrington , also an East Side district leader , could wind up as chairman of the Executive Committee , a post greatly increased in prestige and power under recent rules changes , if he is amenable and other changes go through as scheduled . Mr. Harrington yesterday denied that any choice for chairman of the county committee had been made and said he had been " assured " by Mayor Wagner that the choice would be made by district leaders who have not yet met . The county leadership has been vacant for nearly six months . Carmine G. De Sapio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city campaign , was deposed in the Sept. 7 primary election . Chief interest yesterday centered on the Grade Mansion meeting , called by the Mayor over the week-end . Even as the call went out , it was indicated that Mr. , a scrappy and successful leader in Cayuga County since 1953 , was likely to win the group 's backing . for the state post . The upstater had been a strong supporter of Mr. Prendergast . When it became apparent that the Kennedy Administration no longer would deal through Mr. Prendergast , Mr. sought to get him to resign rather than be humiliated by ouster . Upstate party leaders who gathered at Gracie Mansion last night were John F. English of Nassau , William F. Luddy of Westchester , Robert E. O'Brien of Monroe ( Rochester ) , Peter J. Crotty of Erie ( Buffalo ) , Jack Conway of Oswego , Francis Souhan of Seneca , Donald of Broome , and Leo C. Quinn , Robert Laffin and John J. O'Connell of Albany .
