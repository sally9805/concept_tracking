Getting a driver 's license in Britain is an L of a job . Tyro motorists are forced by law to hang a learner 's " L " on their car , are thus the object of gibes and sneers from every hot-rodder and truck driver on the road . None of this fazed Margaret Hunter , a spinster schoolteacher from Cheshire who at 65 finally decided that it was time for her to get her license . <P> Thinking that her next teaching job might be in the country far from public transport , Miss Hunter bought a snappy little red Fiat , signed on with a driving school , and hung out her L. After only 40 lessons , she was ready for a trial spin . But her jolting stops and starts so terrified her instructor that he got out of the car , remarking : " This is lunacy ; it 's suicide . I 'm not going another inch with you . I 've had enough . " Undeterred , plucky Miss Hunter had another go two days later , sideswiped a five-ton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me it 's a write-off , " she said sweetly . <P> When Miss Hunter showed up for her test , she was tailed by a platoon of reporters and photographers . Climbing into her test car , she stalled seven times , at last put-putted off at 15 m.p.h. , made a quick right turn , nearly crashing into a van , stalled at a stop street , backed over a sidewalk while making a turn , sailed through a red light , flicked on her left-turn indicator at an intersection and then drove straight across , finally parked at the test center-three feet from the curb . So sure was Miss Hunter of her innocence that she refused to heed court summonses to answer for her highway misdeeds . A policewoman finally had to climb through her apartment window to arrest her . In court last week . Miss Hunter declined to enter a plea , said : " I do n't think the question of guilt enters into it . " The court thought otherwise , fined her a total of $55.44.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
