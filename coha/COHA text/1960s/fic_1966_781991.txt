 | " While Guy is winding things up , it will be better not to alarm people . Tell them he 's tired and needs a change . As to Meadowview , we 'll wait and see . I hate to think of your not living here . Maybe you can sell some of the land and rent the stables . We 'll think of something . Perhaps Guy could take a job as manager of the Glenville Club . Nobody else could handle it as well . " " I leave myself in your capable hands , Rex , " I said in frigid anger , turning to the door . " Where are you going ? " " I 'm going for a walk , thank you very much . I 'm going to clear my head . May I come to your office in the morning tomorrow for the bonds ? " " You may . " " Then I 'll go now . " Angelica hurried over to me , as if I were a child behaving badly before company . " Guy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should be , " I said grimly , looking from one to the other . " Without him I should look forward to years in a striped suit . But human beings , my dear Angelica , are so constituted that they adjust themselves very readily to the most unlikely rescues and sink their teeth remorselessly into helping hands . You , of course , think nothing of my giving up a lifetime 's work . To you it 's just one of those silly things men do downtown , and , granted , I 've made a mess of it . But botchers still have their pride . Guy Prime was somebody yesterday . Today he is Rex Geer 's creature . It takes a minute to swallow that . Do n't worry , I shall swallow it . But will you both be good enough to give me that minute ? " Rex at least understood . " Go ahead on your walk , Guy , " he muttered and turned away . Angelica , like a woman , was inexorable . " But , Guy , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? " I ' I slammed the door and strode across the hall to get out to the lawn . At a safe distance , in the dark , I turned and looked back  | at the long , lighted house . With all the mighty events of those two days and with all of the past that their events had churned up in my brain , what burned into it as the hottest needle of humiliation was Rex 's suggestion that I should take a salaried job at my club . That I would never forgive . I can not forgive it yet . This may surprise my grandsons . They may take it as an example of lightness of character . Perhaps that is a difference between 1936 and 1960 . Or perhaps it is merely a difference between me and saner men . But in any case it was of the essence of me , or of what I had tried to make of my own and my father 's ambition , that I was at least a gentleman and not a servant . And Rex knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and of his own blind egotism , that he did not ? Father had gone to his grave convinced that Rex and Angelica had taken advantage of me : that one had used me as a ladder to fame and fortune , and the other as a lifeboat from a mother 's domination . On that feverish night , as I took off to roam the darkened fields of Meadowview , I went so far as to wonder if Rex and Angelica were not bound in some kind of unholy conspiracy to fetter me and reduce me to helplessness . For had they not always despised me ? Did I not make Rex 's success cheap in his own eyes by representing too vividly the very world he had spent a lifetime trying to conquer ? One toiled and toiled in order to be what ? Guy Prime ! Exactly , Guy Prime , the symbol of well-born affluence , of the grandeur of old New York ! And did I not , by being as much of a gentleman as Angelica professed to be a lady , make mock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family ? They could not take it . They could not take my honesty , as the generation before them could not stomach my father 's . My grandsons may be embarrassed to read the story of my courtship of Angelica  --  sex , curiously enough , is not expected in progenitors  --  but I beg them to remember that they were raised in hy-  | pocrisy and that a little truth may do them little harm . They are probably immune to it , anyway . 10 . IN 1910 I RESIGNED from de Grasse Brothers . Armed with my small inheritance froth mother , abandoning New York to my successful competitor , Rex Geer , and sighing with what I hoped was a sigh of relief at being free of a bank that was evidently going to be all his , I went off to see the world . The world turned out to be London and Paris . I went to a great many parties , hunted a great many foxes , had two flattering affairs with celebrated beauties and met all the people in politics , arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashionable memoir of the Edwardian period . In those days celebrities traveled in packs . I went to crushes at Lady St. Helier 's and to small picked dinners at Lady Ottoline Morrell 's ; I visited the studios of Boldini and Helleu , and attended lectures by Bergson and receptions in the old faubourg that I was later to recognize in reading Proust . But as I never had another exit in mind when I rang each bell , it is hardly surprising that , like Omar Khayyam , I always came out by that same door wherein I went . I was too robust , too young , too healthy , too handsome , if I may say so again , to be taken quite seriously . I particularly wanted to cultivate artists , but I found that young writers and painters , who were glad enough to play with me and drink with me and even , in the female cases , to nuke love with me , refused , except jokingly , to talk shop with me . When I at last realized how tnt-ch outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a year of diving in , clambering out and diving in again , I resolved unhappily to take myself home to the consoling  | arms of my always admiring father , and I would have done so had it not been for a lunch party that I attended , a week before my scheduled sailing , at the Paul Bourgets ' . Father had supplied Bourget with much of the material for his Newport chapter in Outre Mer , and the great novelist had been very gracious to me during my Paris sojourn . I think he may have been contemplating a story with an American setting , for on several occasions , in his perfect , ceremonious English , he questioned me closely about the frequency of adultery in the New York fashionable world . What I contributed , however , to his knowledge of my country , was nothing to what he contributed to mine . For I met a new America that day at lunch when I found myself seated next to Mrs. Lewis Irving Hyde . " Going home ? " she exclaimed , when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people always told their plans to Mrs. Hyde . There was something about her straightforward yet not inquisitive air that made one come to the point . ' ' But my clear young man , you 've only done the commonplace things . My daughter and I are going to Senlis tomorrow with Henry Baylies . I think you had better come along ! " " What is Senlis ? " " Well , there you are , you see . It 's simply one of the finest small cathedrals in northern France . " I looked into those large dark snapping eyes that matched so perfectly with the raven hair and wondered if the latter was " touched up . " Mrs. Hyde had already told inc that she had known my mother as a girl and must , therefore , have been well past fifty . I had never known a woman of that age to be so forthright and knowledgeable . She was dressed in a dark suit with a black velvet hat that had a vaguely equestrian air . She was what was beginning to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make me feel that my year abroad has been quite thrown away . " " Not at all . There are certain things that have to be got out  | of one 's system . I think it 's very sensible to begin with the sights that all Americans see . It 's a kind of oat-sowing . After that you make the real start . " " But who will help me ? Who will be my guide ? " " In the novels that kind of task is usually reserved for a sympathetic older woman . " " Would you ? Oh , please ! " If anything could have surprised Mrs. Hyde , this might have . As it was , she burst into high , frank laughter . " Oh , I did n't mean that much older . " " You do n't seem old to me . " This may seem crude , but I had noticed a little pink motherof-pearl heart pinned to her coat , as incongruous as a daisy in a stern college quadrangle . Might not this tall splendid largenosed woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she asked , looking at me more critically . " As I remember the Primes from my young days , that was not their distinguishing characteristic . " " But I do n't want to be just a Prime ! " I exclaimed in sudden heat . " I do n't want to be just an American . I want to know things . I want to know the things you know . Please , Mrs. I-Iyde , wo n't you help me ? " " What a curious young man you are . Well , I wo n't undertake your education , but I 'll take you to Senlis . That much I can do . " Even today I rarely think of Angelica for long without thinking of her mother . Mrs. Hyde dominated her offspring , not in the modern method of possessiveness ( indeed , she was an indifferent parent by today 's standards ) but by the simple method of outwitting them . She was the most " superior " woman I have ever known . She had the feelings of superiority of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlettered , of the devout Catholic for the agnostic Protestant , of the expatriate for the stay-at-home , even of the equestrian for the man on foot . She had an insatiable , ravenous appetite for the  | first rate ; she wanted to explore the twelfth century with Henry Adams and the twentieth with Theodore Roosevelt . Small wonder that Lewis Hyde , an affable , red-faced clubman , adored of his own sex and a crony of T.R. 's , preferred , when not on minor diplomatic posts to which he was appointed by the latter , to remain in Tuxedo Park for golf and drinking and let his wife run about Europe on her heterogeneous quests . I went with her and Angelica the next day to Senlis . Mr. Baylies , a rich old bachelor scholar , very kind and fussy and knowledgeable , whom Mrs. Hyde obviously had at her beck and call , acted as our guide . I had the good instinct to be silent , and it seemed to me , listening to him and Mrs. Hyde discuss arches and apses , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never had I heard from people whom , as rather would have put it , " one knew , " such expertise so easily and so humorously bandied back and forth . I had always assumed that the only purpose of such talk was to " show off , " but Mrs. Hyde , easily striding about the cathedral and talking in her normal tone even at the altar , was obviously indifferent to impressing me . And then there was Angelica . Angelica also was something I had not encountered before . She never once spoke to her mother and hardly once to me . Even to Mr. Baylies , who , as I later learned , chartered yachts on which to take Mrs. Hyde and her family cruising , she was only grudgingly attentive . She seemed entirely concerned with herself and her mannerisms ; she kept pushing hack her long dark hair from her brow and running her finger tips along the wall and over the surfaces of whatever objects she happened to pass . Her deportment was in marked , probably intentional contrast to her mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charm of a pre-Raphaelite gamine . If she spoiled some of her effect by a petulant restlessness , she made it up in the exquisiteness of her physical details : in her finely carved , upturned nose , in her aristocratic high cheek bones , in her large brown brooding eyes . She bore no resemblance to her mother ,  | but neither , as I later found out , did her brothers . The distant clubman of Tuxedo Park must have had strong genes . It was obvious , as we strolled about , that I was to walk with Angelica while her mother paired off with Mr. Baylies . It was equally obvious that this was her mother 's plan , not Angelica 's , for the latter made no effort to be even tolerably pleasant . Indeed , the mere fact that I was her mother 's discovery seemed to brand Inc as a simpleton , if not an actual fraud . If I admired an artifact she would stare at it silently , as if she would never have otherwise observed it , and then murmur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? Absolutely too yummy ! " " You sound as if you were in a pastry shop , " I remonstrated the fifth time that she did this . She turned to me wide-eyed . " But is n't that exactly how one is meant to sound ? " " See here , Miss Hyde , why do you take me for such a nincom-poop ? " " But I do n't , I assure you . I take you for an eager , up-andcoming American youth . " " Which to you is the height of inanity . " " Which to me , Mr. Prime , is the height of nothingness , " she retorted in a sharper tone . " Do n't worry . Europe is n't going to do you a bit of harm . We guarantee to send you back the same as when you came . " " We ? Do you speak for Europe , Miss Hyde ? " " If I do , it 's because I 've earned the right . By having been made to swim all my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " she added with a surprising rush of anger in her tone . " I 'm not being snooty . I 'm simply sick to death of Americans who wander about in Europe ooing and ahing . I 'm a jaded Daisy Miller if you like . A Daisy Miller who 's stayed over here too long and lost her color . For that 's what happens to us , you know . We do n't die of fevers , as poor old doddering Mr. James thinks . We simply fade . "  | " Your mother has n't . " " No , but then Mother 's not quite human . " Angelica , like all the Hydes , as I was soon to learn , could be quite independent out of her mother 's earshot . " She actually eats culture . " It suddenly provoked me that this girl , who had thrust upon her all the things in Europe that I had come to seek , should be so churlish about them . " I know your type , " I said scornfully . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mamma without letting go of the apron strings . You can be as snotty as you like , but will you budge an inch without her ? " Angelica 's surprise at this was not feigned . " Budge where ? " " Will you come out with me tonight and see Paris ? Will you give up chapels and chaperones and have a look at life ? " " Men who suggest improprieties always call it living . " " Is n't it ? " " You 're very pushing , Mr. Prime . I do n't know what I 've said to give you the idea I might be willing to run around Paris with you . " " Why everything ! " I exclaimed . " You sneer at Europe and my presuming to want any part of it . You seem to regard it a kind of privately issued book that only you know . Well , I 'll bet I could show you parts of Paris you have n't dreamed about , Angelica Hyde . Or only dreamed about . And it 'll be a perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only we wo n't take your mother . " " A pity , " she murmured . " She 'd love it so . " " I 'm glad you 'll concede her that much humanity . But tonight I 'm just asking you . " She hesitated , and for a moment I thought she might actually be going to accept . Then she closed her lips suddenly in a tight little line and turned away to join Mrs. I Iyde . " I 'm sorry , Mr. Prime . I have letters that I simply must write tonight . " " Coward ! "  | She made no reply to this , but her silence conceded that the last word had been mine . From that moment there was no idea of my returning to New York . I had decided that I was going to see a great deal of Angelica Hyde . The next day , I skulked about the Hydes ' hotel until I saw Mrs. Hyde come out and walk to her victoria . Then I pretended to be passing by and raised my hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her strong , pleasant tone , " what good fortune sends you just as I 'm tempted to give up my shopping for a drive in the Bois ? Get in . Now do n't tell me you have business . No young man as well dressed as yourself could have business on a spring morning like this ! " We had not traveled as far as the Rond Point before I discovered that Angelica had revealed my proposition and that her mother had placed the worst construction on it . Yet she bore me no grudge . She was European enough to expect a young man to go as far as he could . Only the girl was blamed if he succeeded . " I 've been thinking about your mother , " she now went on , a bit incongruously , to observe . " It brought back those dear dead days in Newport . I remember how well she did in the archery contests . We were all Dianas then . I was so sorry to hear she had died . " The tone was certainly matter-of-fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them . Yet it was so long since I had been with anyone who had even perfunctorily mentioned Mother that to my mortification I found my eyes filled with tears . " I 'm sorry , " I muttered . " I miss her so terribly . " " That 's all right , dear boy . Those tears do you credit . I wonder how many of my brood would shed them a year after I 've gone . Tell me now about yourself and what you 're going to do with your life . Will you be like your uncles ? I seem to recall that they went in rather heavily for the social game . " " They all married fortunes , " I explained , glad of the chance  | to set the record straight . " I shall have to earn my own way . Father wants me to go into the stock market , and maybe I shall . But in the meantime I have this . " I tried to take in Paris with a wave of my arm . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The time is short , the interim is mine , ' " she quoted with an approving nod . " I like you , Guy Prime . Why do n't you come cruising with us this summer ? Darling Henry Baylies has chartered a boat to do the Greek islands , and I 'm helping him make up the party . A handsome , unattached young man who wants to see beautiful things is always welcome . Come along ! " Obviously , I did not need to be asked twice . All that spring and summer I was part of Mrs. Hyde 's travelling court . We cruised in the Mediterranean , but not until August , and in the intervening weeks I followed her about , staying in a hotel in Venice near the palazzo that was loaned to her and in another in Florence where she had rented a villa . In her immediate household were Angelica , two older sons who cane and went , a ( lark old maiden sister of Mr. Hyde , an Italian courier and two Irish maids . Floating on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old professor of Greek at I Iarvard and a beautiful dark Italian prince , with sleepy blue eyes , who bore the unlikely name of Giulio de Medici . But they had one thing in common . I had never before been with people who took such a serious interest in the art of living . I found it altogether exhilarating . My father was less enthusiastic . IIc wrote me at length about Mrs. Hyde , saying that he could never trust a woman who felt she was too good for her native land and who sneered at her own antecedents . Mrs. Hyde , it seemed , did not scruple to speculate that her own ancient Knickerbocker family was of Jewish origin . Father had no patience with this kind of mockery . Also , he warned me , the Hydes had a lot less money than they seemed to have . " It 's not that I want you to be a fortune hunter , " he concluded , " but girls with extravagant tastes and small means make trying wives . Take it from one who learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Angelica 's fortune ; I could leave such considerations to her mother 's obvious candidate , the needy Medici . I felt quite able now to earn all the fortune that Angelica would ever need ; all I had to do was to earn Angelica . For that , in those first Italian weeks , had become my all-possessing ambition . I was giddy with the fantasy of taking her back to New York as a kind of captive bride , of returning to the golden capital of Philistia leading a beautiful hostage princess from the ( lark jungles of an old world culture . The New York that was beginning , now that I seemed indefinitely to have given up work , to regard me as another of its lotus eaters , would have to change its mind . Even Rex would have to change his . Angelica had been very sullen when she found that I had attached myself to her mother 's entourage , and for the first week in Venice she would not vouchsafe me a word . But under the double pressure of Mrs. Hyde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetual cheerfulness in the face of every snub , she began grudgingly to accept my presence and even to address an occasional sarcasm to me . I am sure that she had no intention of being coy , but her conduct was precisely the kind to inflame me . I had had enough easy conquests , and my romantic nature , Victorian in flavor , thirsted for an aloof heroine . By the time we embarked in Genoa on " The Loon " I was violently in love . I do not wish to give the impression that my feeling for Angelica was entirely self-generated . She could be very charming when she wished . In the brief moments of that summer when she emerged from her moody preoccupation she gave us all a good time . She had a rough , rather rowdy laugh and an energy under her pallor that was exciting . Even that old eunuch Mr. Baylies was fond of her . Indeed , all of her mother 's men friends were . She was markedly less popular with the ladies . Madame Bourget in Paris had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hyde aunt obviously disapproved . But  | what did I care for the warnings of older women ? What did they really resent in Angelica but her sex appeal ? I could not make out her relationship with Giulio de Medici . He seemed content to be charming to everyone , in a lazy sort of way , without particularly distinguishing Angelica , and she treated him only a couple of degrees more warmly than she did me . Yet she was clearly concerned about him if anything was wrong . On our first two days under way he was violently seasick , and Angelica sent me half a dozen times to his stateroom to find out how he was . " Is he really a prince ? " I could not help asking her . " Oh , yes . You can find him in Gotha , if you know how to look . It 's not as simple as the Social Register . " " But surely there are n't any more Medici . I 've read Colonel Young , and he says they 're extinct . " Angelica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I had expected her to . " There 's a younger branch . It even produced two rather obscure popes in the eighteenth century . Oh , you can be sure that anything Mother conies up with is pure as pure ! " " And I ? " She laughed her rasping laugh as she gazed over the ( lancing blue of the sea . " Oh , you 're purest Yankee , of course . Purest New York . You might have stepped out of a novel by I-Iarold Bell Wright . Just the way Giulio might have stepped out of The Golden Bowl . Do you remember Prince Amerigo 's eyes , like palace windows thrown open to the golden air ? " " Or to a golden fortune , " I suggested dryly . " Yes , poor Giulio , " she said with compassion , " he needs one , does n't he ? You must go sit with him . I le 's so wretched , and he does n't like me to see him that way . It 's his Italian pride . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll do one thing for me . " " What 's that , dear boy ? " she demanded , in parody of her mother 's tone .  | " When we get to Naples let me take you out to lunch . Just the two of us . Just once . " " To lunch ? What an innocent meal ! How you 've changed since Senlis . What could possibly happen at lunch ? Very well . I hereby remise and release , or give , assign and transfer , as the lawyers say , to Guy Prime and the heirs of his body ( is that right ? ) one lunch in Naples ! " Well , quite a lot ( lid happen at that lunch , despite her sarcasm , for I proposed to her . I was certainly not accepted , but then neither was I insulted . It is a rare woman who resents a serious proposition of marriage from an eligible young man . Angelica was upset ; indeed she was so nervous and agitated that she could not look me in the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not going to talk about this any more now , " I told her , " except to make one statement . You have insisted upon regarding me as a dilettante and an idler with no serious purpose in Europe or anywhere else . That may have once been true , but it 's true no longer . I have a purpose in life now , and I 'm deadly serious about it . " " But I wish you were n't ! " she cried , looking up at me with tears in her eyes . " I never meant to do this to you ! " " But you have , " I insisted , keeping my eyes fixed on hers , until she looked down again . " Will you concede that you have ? " I had to take her silence for consent , and we returned to the yacht . Angelica was too depressed to go to Pompeii . I had accomplished , however , all that I had looked for , and things thereafter were different between us . She no longer treated me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I should thenceforth be a member of her little group on each expedition ashore . She sometimes even flirted with me , particularly if Giulio was present , which gave me my first hint that she might be trying to excite his interest . But that was perfectly all right . Competition had always aroused me to greater efforts . I would flirt back vig-  | orously , even seizing her hand in front of Giulio , who did not seem in the least to mind , until she had firmly to pull it away . I did not delude myself that I was winning her , but I saw that I was tolerated . That was all that I needed for a start . Everyone else accepted me now as Angelica 's swain . Her brothers , Ted and Lionel , tall , bony , rangy dandies , with high shrill arrogant voices who condescended outrageously to all of us and still somehow managed to retain their Hyde charm , treated me with the friendly contempt that men mete out to those of their sex who have found favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pains that he took to show me that my path was clear . I thought it was only fair to advise Mrs. Hyde of my intentions , which most probably ran counter to her own , but she refused to allow me . Sitting by her deck chair on a glorious blue and gold morning as we steamed towards Athens , the flow of my discourse was firmly arrested by the gentle placing of her large cold hand on mine . " Do you know something , Guy , about our little cruise ? " she asked . " The older people are much the happier . We are beyond the age of sentimental complications . It is popular to lament the passing of the heyday of the blood , ' but how sad an occasion that is depends on what one has left . I find the quest of beautiful and ancient things in the company of those whose minds I respect and whose bodies I no longer desire a summum bonum that I could not have imagined in my younger years . You see , I am being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my honeymoon on a yacht in this very Mediterranean , and I was deeply in love with my husband . Yet I find this the pleasanter excursion . I trust I do not embarrass you ? " " Not at all , " I replied with a sigh . " ' There have been moments this summer when I would have gladly exchanged ages with you . " " Ah , but you must never think that way ! That is not the way  | to live at all . Life is like a good meal ; each morsel has its particular savor and purpose . The sweet is just as vital as the soup . You must concentrate on each minute of living . " " And then on eternity , I suppose . You Catholics have it both here and there , do n't you ? " " Do we strike you as Pollyanna ? Do n't worry . We have our doubts . Oh , yes , hideous black ones . But I do n't talk about mine . I want to enjoy my life and enjoy this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enjoy them any more by hearing of romantic complications . " So that was that , and she directed the conversation to the discoveries at Tiryns and Mycenae that we would shortly be visiting . Wonderful woman ! I knew even then , young as I was , that hers must be the secret of living . How could I seize it ? How could I make it mine ? Angelica 's mood seemed to darken as we approached the coast of Greece , and when we docked at Athens she complained of a fever and would not leave her cabin . She refused to have any visitors , and I could only send her notes and flowers . She seemed well enough , however , on the third day to join our caravan of four motors to drive to Mycenae , and I was allowed to go in the one that took her and Mrs. Hyde . All the way , over those long fields , through purple hills and under a leaden sky , she brooded behind her automobile veil . Mrs. Hyde and I talked of Agamemnon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Troy . It was not until the first morning of our stay in Mycenae , when I followed Angelica alone to the Lion 's Gate , that we had any talk . She seemed pathetically white and sad in the white dress that accentuated the darkness of her long hair . " There 's something I do n't understand , " I said . " Why , when you make such a point of disobliging your mother in little things , do you try so hard to oblige her in big ones ? " Angelica had been looking up at the great slabs of the gateway . She now turned and stared at me . " Do I ? How ? "  | " By making up to Giulio . " " Ah , but how can I be sure she wants me to ? " she asked with a shrug . " How can I be sure of doing something she does n't want ? " She waved a hand up at the gateway . " Electra had an easy time of it .

" She would n't care for that . " Her brown eyes fixed me musingly . " And what , dear boy , in the name of Atreus , makes you think she would n't like that ? " " I 'm a poor Prime , and she knows it . " " Indeed , if she does n't , she 'd lw a half-wit , for you 've told her often enough . I never knew such pride in poverty !

" " What is Giulio here for ? " " Oh , he 's for Mummie . He 's part of her collection . She has a whole gallery of European types . But there 's no marrying him to Electra . He needs a bigger dot . " " How much bigger ? " " Oh , oodles of times bigger . I do n't really , properly speaking , have one at all . There are so many of us , and Mummie and Pa spend so much .

But do n't ask me too many times . You might tempt me . " " ' Tempt you ! What the hell do you think I 'm trying to do ? " " Listen to me , Guy .

" " Go away , I tell you ! " I seized her in my arms and kissed her hard on the lips , but she fought desperately and broke away from me and ran all the way back to the car . This time , however , she did not tell her mother ; in fact , she changed motors and went back to Athens with old Mr. Baylies . Giulio was in the same car , but I no longer minded about him . So long as she was afraid of me , I was all right . Our cruise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Corinth and Corfu and then steamed up the Adriatic Coast towards Venice , where we were to disembark . I knew that whatever was to happen between me and Angelica would have to  | happen before that time , and it did , on a cool , calm night as we were passing Ragusa . I was ready for bed and standing by my porthole watching the dusky outline of the mountainous coast when my door opened and as suddenly closed again , and I turned to find Angelica , shivering in a white nightgown , her eyes burning , looking , with her long hair and clasped hands , for all the world like a Lucia or Ophelia about to play a mad scene . Without even speaking , I put my arms about her , if only to keep her warm . " Angelica , dearest , what 's happened ? " She burst into tears , and I led her to the single chair of the cabin , and sat on the deck beside it , holding her hands . " I 've been playing with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute bitch during the whole cruise . I 'm not going to marry you , Guy , but I 'm going to make up for my bitchiness . It 's the least I can do . I 'm going to give myself to you . I Jere I am . Take me ! " " My poor girl . Be quiet . " I kept hold of her hands and leaned my head against her trembling knees as I thought . Men can think at such moments . Oh , yes , they can . I could see with perfect clarity the role of the young man as the romantic code of the day , or perhaps the yesterday , would have conceived it . I would have drawn Angelica to her feet , led her to the door , implanted a chaste kiss on her brow and told her : " No , my clearest , if you will not be mine , freely , of your own will and forever , let us part . I can not take advantage of a mood that , however generous , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cabin and told me in a week 's time that she would be my wife . But would she ? I knew rather more about women than most of my contemporaries of my own milieu . It was my specialty . I sensed that Angelica , however passionate , was still a virgin , and I was quite sure that she had no conception of what might happen to her if a man made competent love to her . She had come to me out of  | desire , but she had still enough of the prudery of her generation to wish to mask it to herself as the discharge of a moral debt . She expected to lie inert on the altar of Venus , a passive penitent , a prim Iphigenia . She never imagined that she would participate lustily in her own sacrifice . But that 's what happened . When Angelica left my cabin in the early morning she was a confused but different woman . She was in a daze all the next ( lay , and the following night , moored off Venice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little cruising party a week later I was able to take her , secretly panic-stricken that she might be pregnant , to Mrs. Hyde and tell her that we were engaged . Mrs. Hyde took it all just as easily as Angelica had originally predicted . " I could n't be more pleased . In my day it was always said that the Primes made good husbands . I had kind of an eye on Chauncey Prime myself once . We 'll cable your father , Angelica , and what would you say to a Paris wedding ? Or do you prefer Tuxedo Park ? " Angelica and I both preferred Paris , and it was decided that we would have a small wedding there in six weeks ' time . The interim was not easy for either of us . Our physical bond proved strong enough to get us through it , but there were terrible gaps that had not been bridged . Angelica may have sneered at her mother and brothers , but it was a defensive kind of sneering , for basically she dreaded their scorn . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lionel , and I was hardly flattered to deduce that she was constantly apprehensive I would make a fool of myself . The Hydes were " special " people , and Angelica was sure that her brothers inwardly felt that she had let them down by engaging herself to a man who was determined to be a stockbroker . For that was what I had told her I was going to be . Worse yet was her mother 's continuing satisfaction , humiliating to both of us , that she had done as well as could be expected under all the circumstances .  | The arrival of our fathers did not make matters any easier . Mr. Hyde plainly resented being dragged across the Atlantic for so trivial a thing as a daughter 's wedding , and my own poor father , for all his effort to please everybody , struck me for the first time as an almost tinny figure in a Hyde midst , the least little bit like a hand-rubbing floorwalker in a department store . He was not pleased with the match , but , unlike Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceal his real feelings , and Angelica , professing to see in him the essence of the world into which she was marrying , drew back in alarm . " Darling , now that we have each other , we do n't need to worry about parents any more , " I tried to assure her . " All that 's in the past . " But her brooding look of doubt confirmed my own suspicion of how wrong I was . In the deepest part of my nature I loved the Primes ; in the deepest part of hers she worshipped the Hydes . Rex came over to Paris , to he my best man . It was wonderful for me , after a year and a half of the condescension of Europe and Europeanized Americans ( granting that I had sought it ! ) to be again with a friend who , for all his criticisms , still cared about me . He was delightful in his enthusiasm ; success , of which he was already having a taste , had softened hint . I le amused Mrs. Hyde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knew little , and delighted her husband with market tips . I le listened affably now to Father 's social anecdotes , and he won Angelica by telling her about his Lucy Ames and how they hoped soon to be in a position to marry . In fact he gave a dignity to the whole life that Angelica and I were about to live without which I believe at the last moment she might have broken off . Angelica had no attendants , and I had only Rex . But at my bachelor 's dinner at the Travellers ' Club I had both fathers , all the Hyde brothers , old Mr. Baylies , our host of " The Loon , " and Giulio de Medici . The latter , I may say by way of conclusion , was the gayest of all .  | WHAT REAL happiness could be expected of a marriage so flawed in its advent ? What true union could emerge from the collision of two such illusions ? I had hoped to find in Europe and in Angelica something better than the ratrace for commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had dreamed of discovering in New York a refuge from the wear and tear of aestheticism and the domination of an unbeatable mother . We both misjudged ourselves . Basically , I was born for a Yankee business life , and Angelica for the world of arts . Basically , I was always my father 's child and she her mother 's . From the start , she was ashamed of me . That was the gist of it . She tried to be a good wife in the early years , but in a tepid , passive sort of way . She did most of the things that I expected of her ( after a few terrible blow-ups ) and adapted herself outwardly to the stock-market society in which I both wished and needed to live , but she was always a bit like a grand duchess in exile , making her noble best of an unfamiliar civilization of neon lights , and never quite coming alive . Sometimes I thought that her obedient conformity was a greater insult to my friends than the grossest insubordination would have been . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; really I 'm not , " her half-shrugging , mildly deprecatory air seemed to imply . " It 's all my own fault , the whole thing ; I 've no illusions about that . What the devil am I doing clans cette galere ? " Of course , this is hindsight . In actual life the decay of our conjugal happiness was a gradual process . Our mutual attraction retrained strong , at least until I went abroad in the first war ; we had two children , who provided a naturally binding force , and there was always Angelica 's Catholicism , stronger in  | her than she would allow . Many couples have stayed together with less in common . But after I returned from the army , and the nineteen-twenties , so much my era and so little hers , began their noisy course , our drift apart became a thing that we recognized and accepted . There was never any question of divorce . I had regarded the war as a final opportunity to be something other than Guy Prime , the stockbroker . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have happened , it would not have mattered if I had been a dead one . I had gone eagerly to the volunteer training camp at Plattsburg and thereafter to officers ' school in Louisville , only to find myself kidnaped by General Devers and placed on staff duty near Paris for the duration . Rex , on the other hand , who had been far too busy in de Grasse Brothers to go to Plattsburg , far too indispensable a man of affairs to go to Louisville , obtained a commission at the last minute by simple pull and went to France where he was awarded the silver star for taking an enemy machine gun nest , one week before the Armistice . The gods had evidently closed their books on any competition between him and me ! I came back from France , determined to enjoy life in what I now deemed was the only way I could : I would snake as much money as possible and spend it as gaudily . I would ignore Rex 's hauteur and Angelica 's moodiness . If there was nut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of it elsewhere . The era , God knows , was propitious for all of this . It was the heyday of the stockbroker , and my little firm did a bounding business . In five years ' time I had founded the Glenville Club , and Angelica had built Meadowview . The latter was the price of " no questions asked . " Angelica forgave me my girl friends in return for a carte blanche for her stables and kennels . It was never put so vulgarly , but that is what it amounted to  --  a modus vivendi . To be queen of the Glenville Hunt seemed to be all that she wanted , and the common gossip was that she had put romance behind her . " Does  | anyone ? " I used to retort with a wink . I was to regret my coarseness on the day I was proved right . Rex , too , prospered in these years , rising rapidly to the position of managing partner of de Grasse , but his glory was shadowed by the increasing illness of his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very sad , yet I doubt if under the best of circumstances he would have enjoyed the ' twenties . Too many undeserving people were also making fortunes . Too many Guy Primes ! And what made things much worse , much darker to this self-appointed judge of his brethren 's morals , was that not only did the brethren pick up fortunes , so to speak , at the roulette wheel , but they had the time of their lives spending them . Shocking ! The only job that Rex would have relished in a casino would have been handing out pistols to the departing bankrupt . His time came with the depression , the odious depression . It was peculiarly a Rex thing . De Grasse not only survived with him at the tiller ; it survived even more solidly than before . To Rex , shaking his head and puckering his brow , the crash on the big board came as a wonderful Dies Irae . He had not spent his money ostentatiously so it was difficult for the ordinary observer to tell how brilliantly he had avoided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observer . He wanted to be judged only by his peers . A handful of the right people knew the full extent of his accomplishment in guiding his bank through those terrible times , and this was good enough for him . No cricket ever hummed more cozily on his warm hearth to see the snowbedraggled grasshoppers outside . As Rex 's big dark car turned slowly into Wall Street in the early morning , the very spokes of its glittering wheels seemed to be saying to the apple vendors : " I told you so . " Whoa ! my exhausted reader may cry . Do I realize , he demands , that I have covered the events between my marriage in 1912 and the bottom of the depression in 1933 , a period of  | twenty-one years , greater than the age of most of my grandsons ? Yes , I am well aware of it . But time is truly measured in intensity , which is why a brief youth seems so huge and vital a portion of a lifetime and a long old age so small and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change its course in leaving a harbor , yet once on the high seas a single heading may bear it to its destination . So it may be with us . When I married Angelica and came back to New York to buy a seat on the Exchange my course was set . Only a major navigational hazard could make me change it . In the first years of the depression I sustained my firm with a series of personal loans . I looked naturally first to my family , but by the end of 1933 , even though I always paid punctually , my visitations to aunts and cousins were becoming less welcome . It was time to turn to Rex , whom I was seeing more frequently than usual , as he had taken to riding on weekends at Meadowview . This had been at my suggestion , when his doctor had prescribed regular exercise following a collapse from overwork . Angelica had even been teaching hint to jump . Indeed , I had noticed with surprise and gratification that , despite the difference in their temperaments and interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of friends . When I.went one morning to Rex 's hare cell of an office in de Grasse , with its single picture , a charcoal sketch of old Marcellus , on the wall behind his desk , and asked mini for a loan of a hundred thousand dollars , he agreed after only a moment 's hesitation , with a stare and not a sermon , with a grunt and not a growl , and with the odd flicker of something like shame in those gray-green eyes .  | IT WAS MY first hint of what was going on . I found out the truth of the old adage that the husband is the last to know . It is not that I would have begrudged Angelica a lover , other than Rex . I had always been uniquely free of jealousy . She could have had discreet affairs with the gentlemen of her hunting crowd , and I would have been careful to look the other way . But no , she had to choose the one man whom I could not tolerate as a " rival . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceivable that the force which drove them was not directed at least in part to the destruction of Guy Prime ? What did they have in common but me ? How could the two people whom I had most loved and on whom I had built so many vain hopes and ambitions , love each other except at my expense ? It was not like Angelica to fall in love at all , let alone so violently . I was well aware that she had a reputation of frigidity in hunting circles . The very recklessness with which she jumped her fences was evidence of a compensatory motive . And if she settled on a man at last , in what should have been the common sense of her middle years , why should it have been a man who had nothing to do with sport or art or beautiful houses , a man who , if possible , was even less of a Hyde than myself ? Why should it have been a man who cared exclusively for the downtown world that she had always professed to despise ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always preferred women like Lucy , who placed their man 's interests before all , or else pathetic lost souls like my cousin Alix ? Had he not relegated women to the dullness of the home , to the dead peace of domestic chores ? Had he not once told me that he loathed sophisticated , horsy females ? What could he see now to admire in  | Angelica who left her housekeeping to me and the butler , who had never in her life made out a laundry list and who spent her days in the saddle or at the kennels in defiance of the most elementary wifely duties ? Yet whatever the reasons or motives there was no possible doubt that Angelica and Rex were carrying on a passionate affair . For years she had paid me only a perfunctory attention , ignoring my questions and opinions in the manner of many a more happily married wife , but now I seemed not even to exist for her . I had almost to shout my remarks to get an answer . She would dream listlessly through rneals and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had company . It reached a point where , if I met her walking across the hall , I had to step out of her way to avoid physical collision . I learned the bitter lesson of the Southern Negro who knows , when he passes a white girl in the street , that he has become an invisible man . Yet I dared not discuss it with her . I knew that if I did , she would fling the truth brutally in my face . To have lived with Angelica was to have learned to doubt if hypocrisy was necessarily a vice . Rex , on the other hand , took the greatest pains to avoid a confrontation . he even found an excuse to cancel our biweekly Monday lunches , a custom of twenty years ' standing , by writing me that his doctor had ordered him to stay in his office at noon and take a nap . As if Rex ever took a nap ! If I encountered him at Meadowview on weekends , riding with Angelica , if I stopped my car to wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurd to witness . Rex had learned only one mask in his struggle up the business ladder : that of the stern and magisterial money-lender . Ile was incapable , to save his life , of assuming a casual pose . He had to be heavy about everything , including adultery . For the first time in my life I was in the grip of an emotion that I did not understand . Was my febrile agitation the agony of humiliation or was it some strange species of ecstasy , a per-  | verse satisfaction in watching the thing happen to those two people that I had always wanted to happen to myself ? I felt as if the top of my head were expanding and rising in the air like a balloon . There were moments when I thought I was actually going mad . Was I in love with Angelica again ? Or was it simple male possessiveness that made me abhor her defection ? Did I resent her conquering Rex 's heart , which I could never conquer ? Was it her taking Rex from me that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , iii my desperat ion I knocked on every door ! The only thing which I could be sure of was that I was romantic again . I wanted to feel light rain on my fevered face ; I wanted to peer through leafy hedges at a loved one bathing in a fountain who knew that I was looking at her ; I wanted to kiss scented notes that accorded me secret rendezvous . I certainly did not want to be relegated to the Glenville Club while Meadowview throbbed with passion . Meadowview that Angelica had constructed as a temple to the chaste goddess of the hunt ! Maybe it was all hokum ; maybe I was simply in love with love , their love . But it was still true that Angelica appeared to me with a freshness and a desirability that she had not manifested in twenty-two years . What was the key that Rex had found that I could not ? And if he had awakened long dormant things in her , might not he be providing a forgiving husband with a second chance ? As the weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my finding out . 13 . OUR TWENTY-SECOND wedding anniversary , in 1934 , coincided with my annual dinner at Meadowview for the Glenville Club  | trustees , and we had guests for the weekend , including Angelica 's mother . Mrs. Hyde , now widowed and old , was nonetheless as admirably brisk and decisive as when I had first met her . She had remained , in her own phrase , " the priestess of the life of reason . " At Meadowview she found herself in the heart of Philistia and liked it . She had seen , after all , most of the beautiful things in the world , and she could afford to relax now and then in an easy atmosphere where comfort was more important than art , and food and wine considerably more important than talk . " My friends will bore you to death , " I warned her . " Not over one weekend . Besides , they make themselves pleasant . You run a good house , Guy . That is an art which I by no means despise . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlooking the garden , and she spent most of her time in it , writing letters and reading . She would descend in the afternoon , crisply booted and buttoned for a solitary walk in the woods , and then she would not appear again until dinner time , at the end of the cocktail hour , in black velvet with a pearl choker . With her for , mal friendliness and her pleasant , incisive questions , she brought out the best in my friends . I went to her room , dressed for dinner , on the evening of the Glenville Club party and found her sitting in a chair by the window . She looked up at me as if she had anticipated my need of communication . " How nice , Guy . Are we to have a little chat before the festivities ? I was just feeling the need of company . The evening 's almost too nice for reading . " It was true . The windows were open , and her room was full of the mild spring air . Below , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried about Angelica , Mrs. Hyde . " " Tell me why . " She listened gravely , without interruption , until I had fin-  | ished the story of the affair with Rex . Then her voice betrayed neither surprise nor shock . " What do you want me to do about it ? " " I want you to keep Angelica from making a terrible mistake . " " You would n't say she 's already done that ? " " I mean like leaving me and the children . " Mrs. Ilyde shrugged . " Why should she do so ? Does n't she have everything a sane woman could want ? A beautiful house , an assured position , plenty of money and a husband who does not begrudge her the company of Mr. Geer . In my day that would have been regarded as a kind of paradise . " " Well , I ca n't very well reproach her , " I said , flushing at the uncomplimentary picture of myself in the background of Mrs. Hyde 's bleak conversation piece . " My own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my dear , but a man 's never has to be . However , far be it from me to deprecate tolerance in a husband . I have never considered jealousy a necessary attribute of virility . " " But I am jealous ! " I exclaimed warmly . " I am hideously jealous . There are more ways of showing jealousy than murdering one 's wife . I want her back . I want another chance with Angelica . " Mrs. Hyde really stared at this . " I thought all that was over between you two . " " Is ' all that ' ever really over ? " " Between a husband and wife , it certainly can be . " " Well , let 's put it that this thing with Rex has revived it . " " On the theory that we never really value a thing till we 've lost it ? " " Or until someone else has taken it . " " Someone else , I suppose , whose taste and habits of acquisition we have always admired . " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mrs.  | Hyde for help , one had to be ready for the long reach of her speculations . " Rex will never marry her , " I said flatly . " He 'll never leave his afflicted Lucy . So Angelica is bound to be hurt . That 's where you come in . You must save her . " " But , my dear fellow , I repeat : why is n't the present arrangement tailor-made for their needs ? Why must there be any question of marriage ? " " Because Angelica belongs to a marrying generation . As does Rex . They 're not old-fashioned , like you and me . They wo n't be able to stand the guilt of their affair . And when they ca n't stand it any longer , they 'll simply blow up . " Mrs. Hyde now seemed more interested . " Do you mean that they will do something violent to themselves ? Or to each other ? " " Such things have been known . But people never anticipate them . Only when it 's too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd only had the smallest suspicion ! ' " But I had not , after all , convinced her . She weighed my argument for a silent moment , and in the end she shook her head . " Nothing of that kind is going to happen here . " " But you 'll keep your eyes open ? " " I always keep my eyes open . " There was never any point pleading with Mrs. Hyde . Whatever one had got from her was all that one was going to get . It was almost time to go downstairs ; the guests would be assembling . But I could not pass Angelica 's door without saying something about our anniversary . I found her at her dressing table , in a splendid red evening gown that must have been new , in the process of putting on her diamond earrings . It occurred to me that she had never worn these for a Glenville Club evening . Was it conceivable that she was wearing them to please me ? After all , Rex was not to he there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looked up briefly at my reflection in her glass . " Ma said I  | was getting sloppy . She said it was high time I took some trouble about my appearance . " " Well , the trouble has certainly paid off . Twenty-two years , think of it ! And you look younger now than you did then . You 've been a good wife , Angelica . " There was another brief glance at my reflection , this time a quizzical one . " You do n't have to say that , you know . " I decides ! that this meager opening was as good as I was going to get . " Listen , Angelica . Take your time about Rex . These things are short enough anyway . But when you and he touch earth next , try to remember that you have some ties here . " Angelica 's face had congealed while I was talking . Now she rose menacingly to her feet and turned on me . " What ties ? " " The children and me . " " Leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sudden , shocking harshness . " Very well , then . Me . " " What right have you to claim them ? " " Does n't a husband have any rights today ? Even in the horsy set of the north shore ? " " Oh , do n't try to be funny ! " she exclaimed brutally . " What has Rex taken that you have not freely accorded him ? What has he taken that you have not sold ? " " Sold ! " " Have you not been borrowing enormous sums from him ? " Angelica drew herself up now to a magnificent stance of contempt . " My only scruple , I can assure you , has been whether or not I was worth it ! " I think that my first reaction , before the humming in my ears became a roar , was simple astonishment that it had never occurred to me that this construction of my conduct might have occurred to them . I had too many relationships with Rex to see a necessary connection between the creditor and the betrayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvation as so  | personal to myself as to be inextricably tied up with honor . Guy Prime was an institution on which a small multitude of people depended : my old father , who lived , at almost ninety , like Anchises , on the vision of my glory , my partners and employees , my children and servants , even to some extent Rex himself and his sacred de Grasse partners . But now , oh yes , I saw it all , and now the noise in my ears became deafening . I raised my hand threateningly . But when Angelica simply continued to stare at me defiantly , I turned and stamped out of the room . I drank many cocktails that night , but despite the glitter in my eye and the feverishness of my manner , on which Mrs. Hyde later commented , I think I was still at the height of my social form . Yet my mind , all the time , was hard at work on my problem . My mind has always worked best under pressure . It seems to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vessel . I had wanted to save Angelica front violence . Now it was clear that I would have to drive her to it . In the middle of dinner I rapped a spoon against the edge of my champagne glass and rose to announce that it was our wedding anniversary . I pride myself that no man , after twenty-two years of the most idyllic nuptial bliss , could have made a more moving address . I raised friendly laughter by saying that I had had to share my bride with the Mcadowview Kennels and the Glenville Hunt . I charmed the wives present with the delicacy of my apology to Angelica for the distractions of my office work and the long hours which the troubles of a depression era had cut out of our shared lives . I made graceful allusions to my absent children and to my present mother-in-law . I delighted everybody by emphasizing how much a happy marriage always owed to friends , and particularly , in our case , to those there gathered about our board . I got a roar of laughter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those in being . Angelica behaved even worse than I had hoped . She refused  | to respond to the toast at all , and after dinner she complained of a headache and went upstairs . Mounting guard by the window in the library where the men were smoking cigars and drinking brandy , I waited until I saw her figure in a coat flit across the turn-around towards the garage . Then I rang for Stride and told him to ask Mrs. Hyde to meet me in the hall . In the hilarious atmosphere of the library my preoccupation and disappearance were hardly noticed . Mrs. I Lytle needed no briefing . " Has she gone ? " she asked at once . " Oh , yes , she 's gone to him . " " But is n't his wife there ? How can she ? " " Lucy 's in Arizona . She 's been there all winter . I 'll send for the car . Will you go after her ? " She eyed me grimly . " You expect a lot of an old woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Probably . But I 'll give it a try . Why in the name of all that 's holy did you have to make that toast ? " " So I could make you take this trip . " " You have your nerve ! " she exclaimed sharply . " I think I sha n't go , after all . " " Suppose Rex throws her out ? " " Ah , but he wo n't . You say his wife 's away . " " Yes , but it 's her house . Her home . Rex can be very terrible about such things . Angelica in that red dress on Lucy 's sober hearth will strike him as the Whore of Babylon . " " Whom he loves ! " " And whom he must therefore expel from the premises . Think of it , Mrs. Hyde ! Think what may happen when your desperate daughter is turned away from her lover 's door ! " " Guy Prime , I believe you 're a fiend ! " " But you forget . I love her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrug was a vivid repudiation . " Thank God I was spared your kind of love ! " The formidable old lady was half-angry and half-amused , half-  | alarmed and half-intrigued . She and I had more in common than any of her family cared to recognize . We were both deeply involved with life , but at the same time understood the role of the looker-on . We could love and see ourselves loving . We could hate and laugh at ourselves hating . And we both resented the world for its audacity in feeling superior to us. 14 . MRS . HYDE BROUGHT Angelica back that night . Things happened essentially , although not precisely , as I had supposed they would . Rex did not bar his door to my errant wife , but he slid send her home , and his doing so meant the rupture of their relationship . Angelica had her pride , at least enough not to go back to him after that . It helped , too , that Lucy Geer returned from Arizona in the following week . There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IIyde , curiously enough , seemed to blame him for this . She was a thoroughly immoral old woman . " What it boils down to is that Mr. Geer would rather have an easy conscience than an easy love , " she told me bitingly . " But be gentle with Angelica . She does n't suspect the subtle role you 've played . That is just as well , believe me . Let it fall on my already despised shoulders . " Angelica 's reaction was stronger than I had expected from so brief an affair . She was wan and listless , and for weeks she would not even ride . She would mope about the house , paying no attention to me or to the servants . She reminded me of Emily Bronte in a play that I had once seen , gaunt , proud and dying , roaming about Haworth Parsonage and pausing from time to time to gaze out a window at the moors . Except Angelica was not dying . Her health was too rude to be  | destroyed by disappointed love . Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I stayed home every night and tried to devise things for her amusement . Happily , as her mother had suggested , she seemed not to hold me in any way responsible for Rex 's defection , and the ugly little scene in her bedroom before the Glenville Club dinner had apparently dropped from her mind . Or perhaps I was simply too unimportant to be resented . She sat impassively on the sofa while I read Trollope aloud and occasionally pulled herself together for a game of backgammon . One evening she came out of herself enough to remark on the change in me . " Why are you so nice to me ? " she asked bleakly . " What do you expect to get out of it ? " " Believe it or not , I feel sorry for you . Is that offensive ? " " No , but it 's hardly necessary . I feel sorry enough for two . " " At least then we can be sharing something again . It 's a start . " " To what ? " she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I replied simply . For 1 was determined now to win my way back to the place in Angelica 's heart that I had occupied a decade before . I was determined , no longer jealously but zealously , to be to her something of what Rex had been . I was perfectly willing to acknowledge the fact that for years  --  from the very beginning , if she insisted  --  I had treated her badly by demanding too arbitrarily that she be the kind of wife I fancied myself as needing and then , having driven her to rebellion , by casting her too completely upon her own devices . Maybe my friends were loud and dull ; maybe I was loud and dull myself . But did I have to be ? Had I not won Angelica originally by subtlety , and might I not win her back with a little of the same quality ? I gave up going to the Glenville Club ; I even gave up golf and went riding on the weekends with Angelica . When the children were home , I warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as to insinuate that she was traversing the nervous  | tensions of a change of life . When Angelica learned this from a talk with Evadne , she was touched and even amused . For the first time since her break with Rex , I got a bit of her former banter . " I do think that was tactful of you , old boy . Troubles of the heart are peculiarly undiscussable with children . For you to have substituted another in their minds , equally undiscussable , was sheer genius . " And , all of a sudden , Angelica and I were friends again . But I was careful not to push her . Oh , so careful ! Everything I had learned in twenty-two years I now put to good use . I did not talk about my usual subjects , but neither did I presume to talk about hers . I steered our conversation as much as possible to neutral territory where she could not have unfavorable preconceptions of my opinions . These I could now adapt to fit the image of the gentler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Naturally ! All courtship is premeditated . I was in the ridiculous situation that French conic playwrights delighted to explore : I had fallen in love with my wife ! " Of course , I see you have a plan , " Angelica told me . " But I 'm darned if I see what it is . " " It could n't be the very simplest ? " " The simplest ? " But we were riding , and she spurred her horse ahead to avoid my answer . Obviously , she knew what it would have to be , and I assumed that she did not want to have to repudiate it . I wonder if Angelica today , so many years afterwards , would still deny that something rather beautiful was happening to us . Certainly at the time it was apparent to both that our reconciliation was going to be more than a handshake and a sharing of the morning crossword puzzle . Angelica may not have wanted it to be more , but she was like a person lost in indolence , floating down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paddle in the water she could have stopped it altogether , or at least  | changed its direction , but the gentle movement had become habitual , almost pleasant . She was tired ; she was humiliated ; she was lovelorn . And there was I , her lawful , wedded husband . I will not embarrass my reader with further details . I took Angelica off to my Caribbean island , wisely representing it as a business trip so that pleasure should not seem unduly to predominate to her embarrassed eyes , and there we had a second honeymoon , more wonderful , if briefer , than the first . Angelica did not tell me when she became pregnant . I learned of it from her doctor who suggested that I persuade her to give up riding . She was forty-five and had not given birth for seventeen years . He warned me that she might not have too easy a time . Exuberant and exhilarated at his news , if not his warning , I rushed home from his office to embrace her and to be sharply repulsed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " she cried in anguish . " But , darling , why not ? " " It 's so ridiculous at my age ! How can I face Percy and Vad ? " " Why , they 'll be tickled pink ! Wait till I tell them . You 'll see ! " " Do n't tell them , Guy . Do n't . I beg of you ! " I knew enough about the moods of early pregnancy to obey her and leave her alone . But , alas , I proved unable to be as discreet abroad as I was at home . I had now resumed my golf , and on a glorious Sunday morning , after I had gone around in seventy-four , I took my customary place at the men 's bar with overflowing spirits . As luck would have it , one of my cronies was boasting that his newly born son , the fruit of his second marriage , was younger than a grandson , issue of the first . " But you used two wives ! " I burst forth . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with one . " " I.ike whom ? " " Like me ! " I turned to thunder at the bartender : " A round for all the gentlemen , Pierre . I may not have a grandson , but I  | have a boy at Harvard who is perfectly capable of giving me one . And in eight months ' time that boy will have a baby brother or sister . A full brother or sister , gentlemen ! " I realized from the shout of congratulation that followed how grave my error had been , but what could I do but join in the toast and pray to be forgiven ? Angelica found out the very next day when the wife of one of my bar friends called up to " commiserate . " Everyone assumed , of course , that the child was a " mistake . " Angelica was angrier than I had ever seen her . I found her waiting for me that night in the hall when I came home . " You could n't wait , could you ? " she hissed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your triumph in that sordid bar of yours ! Like an old rooster going cock-a-doodle-doo before the other old roosters ! " " I 'm sorry , dear . " " Sorry ! Why should you be sorry ? You 're only being yourself . The same self you 've been front the beginning . I 'm the one who should be sorry . I learned once what you are , and I learned to live with it . And then I was fool enough to let myself get caught in the same old trap . Well , it wo n't happen again ! " Even after making every allowance that I could for her condition , I still could not explain away the near hate that I read in her eyes . " Angelica , please , " I begged her , as the tears started into my own , " do n't spoil the last two months ! " " Spoil them ? " she retorted . " I think I can safely leave that little job to you ! " At this I lost all restraint . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so quickly dispelled , let him remember that it had been preceded by ten years of mere mutual toleration and , more immediately , by the affair with Rex . " It 's because you do n't want him to know , is n't it ? " I shouted at her . " It 's because you do n't want him to know how soon you consoled yourself ! " Angelica , as she walked away , threw her retort over her shoul-  | der in a voice of cold disdain . " You 're not fit to discuss him . Not with me , anyway . I 've told you that before . " A week later , in the big pasture , taking a four-foot fence she fell and miscarried . I was playing golf when word was brought to me . I drove home at a reckless pace and tore upstairs to the room where Angelica was lying in bed , her face a whitish blue , her eyes fixed on the ceiling . She turned to look at me , but she did not speak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have done it , " I said with a sob , " if it had been Rex 's child ! " Angelica simply turned her head away . The Hydes were intrepid people ! When she was well again , we went back to our old lives , she to her horses , I to my business and clubs . It was surprising how little animosity was apparent in our personal relations . But this was the period of my first embezzlement . I used bonds belonging to Aunt Amy as security for a private loan . In a month 's time I had put them all back , and nobody was the wiser . Thereafter , I did the same thing in other accounts , perhaps half a dozen times . Each time , of course , it was a crime , punishable by jail . Yet I do not recall that I ever felt the faintest twinge of conscience . Why ? Why did a man brought up as I had been , a gentleman born and bred , after so many years of straight conduct , suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remorse ? It was suggested at the time of my trial that I suffered from megalomania , that I was a kind of sun king of stockbrokers who recognized no distinction between his own accounts and those of his customers , that I strutted up and down between Trinity Church and the East River declaiming : " Wall Street , c'est moi . " But this was drivel . I would rather have people raise their hands about my morals than shrug their shoulders about my sanity . At all times I was perfectly aware of what I was doing and of the consequences of discovery .  | What had happened was that I had lost my faith in the world as a place in which there was any point for me to live except as a rich man . Angelica and Rex , between them , had destroyed my faith in myself . He had scorned me as an equal in the man 's world of business ; she had scorned me as her master in the man 's world of the home . So low had I fallen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone in my family , in my office or in all my large circle of friends would be interested in seeing a poor Guy Prime . Like a prima donna who has lost her voice or a priest who has lost his faith , such a Guy Prime would have struck me as being without use or function . The world insisted on seeing me only in the role of king of the Glenville Club . Very well . It would never see me in any other . I would be that or I would be nothing . I will say this much in extenuation of what I did . I never took a penny that its owner could not have spared . Not for me was the widow 's mite , the orphan 's pence . I " borrowed " from only three sources : from the profits that I had made for my rich friends and relatives , from the portfolio of the country club that I had founded and from a family trust that I had set up out of my own pocket . To keep up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funds of that world . In a way , I still think it owed them to me. 15 . THE MORNING after the " Meadowvicw Pact " between Rex and myself in that fateful spring of 1936 , when I bargained away my birthright to engage in business ( my very manhood , by the standards of downtown ) in return for a loan that was the merest pittance to him , I arrived in my office to find that , good to his  | dearly purchased word , he had already delivered the America City bonds from my loan account at de Grasse . By ten o'clock these had been delivered in turn to Jo Beal , Treasurer of the Glenville Club , and I was again a free man . Free , that is , to do nothing . Free to liquidate Prime King . Free to commit suicide and remove an unpleasant reminder from the high and mighty gaze of Reginald Geer ! But I had never for a minute intended to give him that satisfaction . I had already made my plans for the summer which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rex was in England , partly for pleasure , partly for business ( de Grasse had a London branch ) , and Angelica had rented a cottage at the Cape where Evadne and Percy joined her . I gave up my apartment as a needless expense and took a room at the empty Schuyler Club . If I had changed my name I could not have removed myself more effectively from my Long Island world . All during those hot months a part of me sat and watched Guy Prime struggle for his financial life . For instead of closing down my firm , I was using every last resource to place it once more among the first in Wall Street . Such was my real crime , if crime it was . As I saw it then and as I continue to see it today , my moral guilt turns on one question : what would have been Rex 's damages had I succeeded ? Should he not have been glad to have his son 's future father-in-law a power again in Wall Street ? And if I failed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to repay his loan , that was all . It boiled down to this : Rex had stipulated that I cut my throat and leave his debt unpaid . I proposed to have my throat and pay him back . Was I bound to lose all for his pride ? I wanted to see no one from my old life . I was even glad that Evadne was away . I felt that the disgrace of being a small boy reprimanded by a stem headmaster had to be wiped clean before I figured again in the social world . However invisible the stain of this imagined shame , I would keep to myself until I  | could appear , both inwardly and outwardly , as the old Guy Prime . I would not so much as step across the threshold of the Glenville Club so long as I was the creature of Rex Geer . During the week I was busy enough , and on the weekends I went to my sister Bertha in Westhampton , where she had a shingle cottage on the beach to which she invited her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bertha , who had lived with Father until he died , had developed with long delayed freedom into the petty tyrant that she had hated him for being to her . She had long straight sandy hair , tied in a knot in back , a heavy countenance with chin thrust forward and watery pale eyes . She lived , despite tweeds and walking sticks , and a considerable consumption of whiskey , on a gross mental diet of romantic art : of Verdi and Puccini and Saint-Gaudens and Rodin and Greta Garbo . She pretended to sneer at me and held me up to her friends as Goliath himself , but she was really delighted to show me off . I was the wind of the greenback prairies of the real world into their closed interior , and I had conic batting in  --  that was the great thing ! ? not at their own timid solicitation but of my own accord . I was the proof ( or a little wishful thinking could make me seem so ) that the captains and the kings of ea th , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would come clown to the beach and to Bertha Prime and sit on the veranda to talk of death and beauty . Bertha had resented that Father and life had loved me and scanted her , but she was all ready to forgive . Oh so ready ! A little scolding , and I was her big darling brother again . " I 'm not surprised , Guy , after all that horsy set of Angelica 's and all those sports-coated golfers , that your soul should cry out for a bit of companionship with those to whom the planet is more than a field for organized sport . You 're late in starting , but you 're not too late . After all , I can remember the dear dead days when you and Rex read Browning aloud . "  | I was oddly content , in the suspended existence of those weekends , with Bertha and the gentle little group that obeyed her and liked obeying . We walked on the dunes ; we read plays aloud ; we listened to symphonies on the Gramophone , and we put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Cape , thought I had taken leave of my senses , and of course I had . Waiting for things to happen , one did not want to feel the interlude . From the beginning of September to the middle of October a series of disasters occurred , one after another , that proved , if proof were needed , that the gods were against me . No protagonist of ancient Greek drama was more buffeted and with less cause than I. Had I once spurned Aphrodite when she reached out her snowy arms to me ? Had I enjoyed a nymph for whom jealous Zeus had lusted ? Or was it a matter of inheritance , and did I , like my father , have to pay for the hubris of some Prime ancestor ? An early fall hurricane wrecked my Caribbean resort so that its opening had to be postponed a year . An injunction in that almost settled title suit closed down the operation of Georgia Phosphates . And finally the government insisted on additional studies before authorizing the issuance of my little drug company 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our entire production . All I needed was a little time to overcome my obstacles . As I have pointed out before , my ventures ultimately brought in millions  --  for others . Knowing that it was my last gamble , I now flung into my businesses everything I could lay my clutching hands on and borrowed from everyone I knew . Angelica was back at Meadowview , but I did not welcome her questions , or Evadne 's , and I stayed in town . My days and nights were devoted to meeting friends in search of loans , to delaying creditors , to pumping heart into associates . But still I needed time . When the idea occurred to me of using the securities in Angelica 's trust , my first reaction was simply a mild surprise that it  | had not occurred to me before . I had set up this trust for Angelica and the children on Father 's death , using all of my inheritance . I had wanted them to be independent , at least for necessities , of my own risky businesses . Standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the donor of the fund and because the trust instrument had given me the widest powers of investment and discretion , the bank had tended to regard itself more as a depositary than a fiduciary , and had allowed me to buy and sell as I chose and to keep the securities in my office vault for months at a time . This may seem very relaxed to present-day readers , but we were in 1936 , and my name on Wall Street was still a synonym for reliability . Ironically enough , I had done better with this trust than with my own things , and there were seven hundred thousand dollars of stocks and bonds in my possession on that autumn Monday morning when I decided to pledge the lot . The curious thing about my mental state was that I knew it was too late . I was convinced , in superstitious fashion , that nothing now could save me . There sitnply seemed to be a bleak and necessary logic in hurling this last log upon a dying fire . I do not , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I acted to save myself and my ( inn . I had to put down the last trump ; it was the only way to play the hand . But in playing it , as coolly as I knew how , there was no longer hope in my heart . By the middle of October word of my multiple borrowings had penetrated even to the sleepy corner where Standard Trust Company , like the dragon Fafner , dozed over its hoards . It had been a great bank in its day , but , swollen with fat old trusts whose beneficiaries were now too numerous to be effective critics and under the presidency of my late Uncle Chauncey , who had always been off yachting with his rich wife , its claws had dulled and only a faint puff of smoke was from time to time emitted from its clenched jaws . Now there were stirrings . Twice my  | obliging friend Pete Bissell lunched with me and asked timidly if it would n't " look better " if the trust assets were kept in the custody of the corporate trustee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " How would you look if your co-trustee made off with the corpus of the trust ? I guess somebody at Standard would have your corpus ! " Pete laughed , chokingly , half reassured , half scandalized . In the soft compliant eye of the eternally reassuring trust officer there was a little yellow spark of panic . But no . Not the senior partner of Prime King ? Not the nephew of Chauncey Prime ! " When will you send it over ? " " Next week . " And next week I would forget . I might even have got away with it , miraculous as it now seems , had an article not appeared in the Sunday Times on the damage of hurricanes , with pictures of my battered resort and , alas , a picture of me . Fafner awoke at last , and on Monday evening , as I was about to leave my office , I heard his belated roar on the telephone . " Mr. Prime ? It 's Howard Landers . I 'm a trust officer at Standard Trust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Landers ? " " It has come to my attention that some of the securities of Mrs. Prime 's trust are actually in your custody . " " That has been our usual practice . " " It is most irregular , Mr. Prime . Most irregular . " " Look here Landers , this is not an ordinary trust , and I happen to be your co-trustee . Pete Bissell is the man over there I deal with . Have you cleared this call with him ? " " I le 's cleared it with me , Mr. Prime . I am taking over supervision of your wife 's trust . The first thing that I shall do is to correct at once this unprecedented irregularity . I must insist that all assets of the trust be delivered to the bank no later than tomorrow morning . " " Tomorrow morning ! "  | " Is there any difficulty , Mr. Prime ? Are the securities not physically in your office ? " " Of course they are . But I do n't understand your tone . To call up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly traded securities in his office  --  a great convenience , incidentally to both trustees  --  and expect to reverse the procedure over night  --  well , it sounds as if you were suspicious of some-thing ! " " I regret how it sounds , Mr. Prime . But our messenger will be over for the securities in the morning . " " Do you realize , Mr. Landers , that your attitude means that I shall never do business with Standard Trust again ? " " We have calculated the risks , Mr. Prime . " No , Mr. Geer was not in , his secretary told me when I called . Mr. Geer had left the office and was ( lining out  --  she ( lid not know where  --  but was going to the opera later . I called Bertha who had Aunt Amy 's box on Monday nights and asked her if she could spare a seat for me . " Since when did you become an opera fan ? " " Be nice , Bertha , " I sighed . " I 've had a hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't snore . My friends are not the kind who go to the opera just to be seen . " I was late for Traviata and thought I would have to wait for the intermission to seek out Rex , but then I spotted him in a box only two away . I tiptoed out to the corridor and into the back of his box and stood for just a moment behind his chair before placing my hand on his shoulder . Ile looked up and , without even a word or a whisper , followed me from the box . He must have been prepared for the worst . No doubt to Rex my face had become the symbol of his personal doom . He would take it , as he took all things , like a man . In a corner of the empty bar we sat at a small round table , and I looked about for a waiter . " No , no , " he muttered , " give it to me straight . "  | So I did , watching him as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congealment . When I had finished there was a moment of silence , a moment of something almost like peace between us . What would have been the point of violence now ? " I realize that you may be the victim of an obsession , " he said at last . " The rational part of me tells me that men like you may really not be responsible for their acts . But I wonder how much the concept of personal fault means to me . What seems important now  --  in fact , the only thing in the world that seems important now  --  is for me to recognize and learn to face the thing in you that is wicked . Maybe you ca n't help being wicked , any more than you can help the shape of your nose . But there it is , your nose and the wickedness . Before me . I see them . " And he looked straight through me , as if at something strange and distant , but somehow no longer threatening . I had the distinct feeling that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole world . There were many things in that feeling , but I wonder if relief may not have been one of them . " Go ahead , Rex . Get it off your chest . I have it coming to me . " " We 're beyond recriminations , you and I. " " Then let 's not be beyond reason . Put up the money once more and I will sign over everything I own to you . You will hold it for Angelica and Evadne and Percy under any terms you wish . When my ship comes in  --  and it will come in  --  they will be rich . I will take myself away  --  to a Pacific island , anywhere ? I 'll never bother you again . All you will have to do is hold the securities and wait . " " I Iow much will it take this time , Guy ? " he asked wearily . " Three quarters of a million . You see , I do n't beat about the bush . " Rex continued to be inscrutable . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't raise that much on such short notice . Your last loan cut me too low . "  | I stared . " But surely , Rex , you must be several times a mil-lionaire " " " It 's all in trust for Lucy and George . I did what you did . Only I 'm not an Indian giver . However , I can go to Marcellus de Grasse . Of course , I 'll have to tell him . " " Of course , " I murmured , without conviction . " But you will go to him ? " " Where will you be tonight ? " " In my room at the Schuyler Club . " " What will you do if the answer is no ? " " What can I do ? " Rex 's gray-green eyes fixed me with a defiant glitter . The defiance was at my thinking that he would not say it . " Men have been known to kill themselves under these conditions . " " Well , I wo n't do that , " I retorted with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show out . I never could leave even a movie early . I like to know how things end . " " Very well . " Rex rose . " Let this he good-by , then . Whatever happens , I do n't think I want to see you again . I shall deal through George . George , too , will have to know all . " " Yes , " I said , in the final flare-up of my bitterness , " he will have to know all , your all . Nobody will ever know mine ! " " Not even the creditor who shares your disgrace ? Who is involved in your crime ? " " Oh , shucks , Rex , you wo n't have to go to jail . " " There are worse things than jail . " " That 's the ultimate Rex ! " I cried , in sudden , passionate anger . " That 's the Rexest thing I ever heard ! You 've robbed me all my life , and now you want to steal the final iniquity of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were you not picking my pockets ? Father was on to you from the beginning . You envied me my popularity , my family , my whole bright little place in the sun . You hated those things because they were n't yours . You had to have them , not to enjoy them , but to  | destroy them . You grabbed the fortune that I should have made , and what have you ever done with it but build a big house that 's as dreary as yourself and prate about morals while you practiced adultery ? You made a world that 's more sordid than the old Prime world that you sneered at , only yours is n't even gay . It 's drab as a crow ! " Rex listened to all of this without the twitch of an eyelid . Then he rose . " I 'll send word to your club , " he said in his stoniest voice , " wiled I 've made up my mind . " He left the bar , and I returned to my seat in the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review my life , with Bertha and her friends , at a performance of Traviata , yet it was there that I brought to its finest pitch the sense of detachment that I had cultivated all summer . It was the only thing that got me through my years in jail . I saw that the common denominator of the little group in the box , other than myself , was that none of them had ever lived . The old bachelor colonel , a frustrated pederast , clutching the Republican principles of the Reconstruction era , lived only in his silly politenesses to spinsters and in the mutterings of his hate as he read of socialism in the newspapers at his club . The widow with the necklace of garnets and the turkey 's neck lived in an imaginary past , the squeaky spinster twin sisters in an imaginary present , and Bertha , sleepy with her double potion of gin , beating time with her big foot to the music , dreamed of being a courtesan in the second empire , of giving up her house and jewels for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ardent young man . Did I wish I were one of them ? Did I wish I had stayed with Bertha , shared an apartment with her as a bachelor brother , gone to meetings of the Society of the Cincinnati and watched Armand and Violetta with moist eyes on Monday nights ? Did I wish to be , like Bertha 's friends , exempt ?  | No . Not even then . Not even with all the black void that loomed . I was happy that I had engaged with life , that I had married a beautiful woman and fathered healthy children and made and spent fortunes and founded a great club . New York would not soon forget Guy Prime . And if all ended hideously , New York would forget him even less . When the big golden final curtain fell at last , on Traviata and on me , I knew that I would find a message at the Schuyler Club , that Rex had failed in his mission . I felt only numbness in my heart as I remained standing and applauding until the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talked about the singers until we reached my club . I slightly surprised her by kissing her goodnight on the lips . The boy at the desk handed me the message for which I had already extended my hand . The next morning Prime King Dawson &; King was suspended from trading , and by noon it was generally known in the street that we were bankrupt . The long Manhattan career of the Primes had ended in a hell as bright as any in the Bishop 's sermons . 16 . ON TUESDAY afternoon , after my firm had closed its doors forever , I consulted with our aghast old lawyer , Horatio Carter , whose white cuffs fluttered like moths as I spoke , and told him that I meant to plead guilty to an indictment for embezzlement . I interrupted when he began to expostulate and requested him firmly to go to the District Attorney , who would be preparing a warrant for my arrest , and tell him that in the morning , after a night at Meadowview , I would be at his disposal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an old friend , would guar-  | antee my availability . When Carter had departed , his cuffs still aflight , I took my last drive to Long Island . One more shock awaited me , and that was the inundation of sympathy in which I found Meadowview sopped . Limousines jammed the drive , the hall overflowed with flowers and , in the living room , a bewildered Angelica , still in riding habit , was serving coffee to solicitous friends . Something buckled in my resolution of detachment at the impact of so much affection and concern , and the tears boiled up in my eyes . Put they evaporated soon enough at the realization that the love in that room was not for me . It was for Guy Prime , the bankrupt . They did not yet know of Guy Prime , the crook . Standing in the doorway I raised my voice to dominate the assembly . " My friends , you are here under a misapprehension . You think that merely my firm has failed . That is the least of my concerns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trust funds in my custody . I regret to inform you that I shall have to plead guilty to that indictment . I leave you now to offer your sympathies to my unfortunate family . This news is as much of a shock to them as to yourselves . " I have never known silence like the silence that followed this announcement . In the moment before I turned and strode to my study , it seemed that the very walls and floor must have been saturated with it , and the white looming faces of which I was conscious only in mass were no longer the faces of friends , but a composite expression of dread and horror . I had become a specter in my own home . Angelica followed me to the study . She was very nervous and kept striking her leg with her riding crop . Rex , it appeared , had already telephoned and told her the worst . She seemed undecided as to what reaction was the most appropriate : indignation , sympathy or simply impatience at so bizarre an interruption of normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embezzlement that you will most mind , " I said grimly . " It will be my letting Rex down after all that he 's done . " " Well , I mind that , of course , I mind it terribly , but it 's not Rex who 's going to prison . Rex will survive . My concern , believe it or not , is for you , old boy . One ca n't be married to a man for twenty-five years and see him go off to jail with a dry eye . There must be some way I can help . What can I do , Guy ? " " Nothing , my dear . Nothing at all . In crime one is all alone . One never knows how much till it happens . " I paused , making out the sudden warmer sympathy in her eyes . Poor Angelica ! It was so like her to spurn participation in my success and then reach out to share my bread and water . Whatever else she was , she was a lady . " I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she was saying . " I 've thought it all out because I 've seen it all coining . Not your going to jail , perhaps , but our being broke and under a cloud . I 've had the summer for that . I think I'in even beginning to understand the role that our incompatibility has played . It occurs to me that this may be our golden last chance to make up to the children for our selfishness . Let 's do the thing with style , Guy ! Prison , poverty , the works ! Let 's show the world we know how to live on the bottom even if we did n't know how to live at the top ! " Did she mean it ? Was it anything more than a handsome Hyde gesture , a bow to the code of behaving well ? But whatever it was , it was too late . There had been too many years of laughs , too many shrugs , too many quips , too many sneers , too much of each seeing the worst in the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there to go back to ? " That 's very sweet of you , Angelica , but it 's also very sentimental . Your feeling does you credit , but it 's not a feeling to build on . It 's too high class , too much the noble thing . My dis-  | honesty has inspired you . But I have a better plan . I want to get out of your life , once and for all , and give you another chance . It 's not too late . " I paused , to give what was coming its full effect . " I want you to divorce me , Angelica . I want you to divorce me , and when Lucy Geer dies , which ca n't be too far off , I want you to marry Rex . " Angelica 's dark eyes slowly hardened into two slate discs . " Did you have to become a crook , Guy , to get rid of me ? Could n't you have asked me for a divorce before ? " " ! ' lease . Angelica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand . " " I 'm trying ! I 've been trying for twenty-five years ! Tell me what more I can do for you . Shall I get the divorce while you 're in prison ? Shall I go hunting tomorrow while you 're being arrested ? Shall I wear yellow when you 're wearing a striped suit ? " " Angelical " I exclaimed firmly . " You will do no such thing . The divorce can wait my release . It would look otherwise as if you were leaving a sinking ship . I 'll be the rat , thank you , if there have to be rats . I 'm getting out of your and the children 's lives forever . And it will be very much to everyone 's good that I do ! " " And my heart has bled for you all afternoon ! " Angelica continued in a trembling voice . " You 're right , Guy Prime . I 'm an arrant sentimentalist . Why , you 're having the time of your life ! " It was a terrible ending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really ended long before . The pain that Angelica 's pain might ordinarily have caused me was reduced to a mere dull ache by the anaesthesia of my impending conviction . When one is going to jail , believe me , boys , nothing else is quite real . I remember thinking at that moment that I understood the style with which the victims of the French Terror went to their deaths . The same dope enabled me to get through the even harder scene with Evadne and Percy that immediately followed .  | Everything that followed my conviction worked out as neatly as everything before it had ended messily . Once those gods had me in jail , they appeared to be satisfied . Standard Trust Company , sharing my negligence if not my crime , put seven hundred thousand dollars back into Angelica 's trust without even a protest . At the same time Meadowview was condemned for a highway , and Angelica got a good price for it . In a smaller house she continued to hunt and to live well enough . Evadne married George and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everyone survived the war , and everyone today is prosperous and happy . When I was released from prison in 1941 , where I had been allowed to work , not too unhappily , as a librarian , I went to Panama . Angelica , at my repeated request , divorced me in 1942 . Lucy Geer survived until 1948 , and Angelica and Rex , two elderly lovebirds , were finally wed . From all that I hear it has been a most happy union . The relationships that it created may seem a bit bizarre : Evadne and her husband became stepsister and step-brother , and Angelica became her own daughter 's mother-in-law . However , in present-day New York such things probably no longer raise an eyebrow . Only the fundamentals count , and Rex has always been full of them . Sometimes it seems to me that I was an I phigenia , that the gods had simply demanded my neck as the price for according victory to the army of Agamemnon . Certainly as soon as I had detached my ill-fated self from the baggage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoother . I was perfectly content for many years to philosophize to myself by the shores of the still Pacific and was proud to be above the need of selfjustification . But now that a new generation is growing up that does not know me and that I do not know , I find that I do not want to exist for them only in newspaper accounts and in the smooth , no doubt charitable interpretations of my conduct offered by Angelica and Rex . I want , after all , to be heard . Please , Evadne , think twice before you tear this up .  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | strode into my office downtown and plunked on my desk the memoir that her father had written two years before and that his widow , acting on his posthumous instructions , had forwarded to her , unopened . " I 'm sorry but you 'll have to read it , Uncle Rex . Every word of the wretched thing . When you and Mummie married , you became my real father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one has done . 1 ) o I have to show this libel to my boys ? He says the most ghastly things  --  really , you would n't believe it . I 've simply got to have your advice . And Mummie 's , too . " When she had left , I read the manuscript at a single sitting . Guy had had the consideration to have it typed . It was the last consideration that he had showed his survivors . What he had to say about Angelica and myself was wormwood but I supposed that the grandchildren could take it . Youth had become extraordinarily tolerant about such matters , much too tolerant , I thought , but now was not the time to quibble about that . What was very much worse to an old man , what , in fact , turned my heart to black ice , was the prospect of having to show my three grandsons this baldly cynical account of their other grandfather 's crime . Obviously , Guy , to his dying day , had not believed that he had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get caught ; that was all . In the cartoon of his mind his judges wore striped suits beneath their ermine . There was no such thing as justice to be expected from such a bench , only cant . Wall Street became a kind of Nottingham , and Guy , Robin Hood . I Iad he written the memoir at the time of his conviction , and had we been back in those days , I should not have so much feared its effect on young men . What disheartened me was the odious suspicion that time might have been on Guy 's side , that perhaps young men today would not be so shocked at what he had done . Was it , as he implied , like being caught with a trot in school ? Were rules and regulations more than penalties in sport ? Was the whole sad business simply a game ?  | One thing , however , I was perfectly clear about . If we should decide that Guy 's memoir had to be shown to his grandsons , they should not be allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone out  --  which I still did not for a minute admit ? I would insist on my right to argue that they had once existed . I gave it to Angelica to read that night . She was much less upset than I. She professed to find it the kind of apologia that she would have expected of Guy , and she had even the detachment to be amused by parts of it that were not in the least amusing to me . She had no hesitation about showing it to her grandsons , and she made the telling point that Evadne might break down altogether if she were to tear up the manuscript and then , in a fit of remorse , decide that she had abandoned her father living and disobeyed him dead . Angelica pooh-poohed my plea that we at least suppress the chapters on Guy 's courtship and on our affair . " Certainly not . I never could bear the sanctimonious sort of person who takes an unfair advantage of survivorship to censor the dead . Let 's either burn Guy up or keep hint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children are going to be shocked that I had an affair with each of my husbands before I married them ? ' Think of it , to have been twice made an honest woman ! Anyway , it 's nothing to what young people do nowadays . And , besides , they wo n't believe it because nobody really believes their parents or grandparents ever made love . My mother used to hint that she had had affairs , but I always thought she was boast-ing ! " I sighed-at such evidence of my wife 's intransigent honesty , but I knew there was nothing to be done about it . " You do n't think the memoir contains some rather grave misrepresenta-tions ? " " It depends what you call ' grave . ' I certainly never found Guy 's father the charmer he makes him out . Nor did I ever think Alix Prime had any looks . But I daresay that 's one point on which both you old dogs might agree . "  | I coughed . " I was thinking of more fundamental things . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys out on those . That is , if they can ever get through it . Do n't be too heavy and bankerish , my dear . Remember , this is a job of persuasion . You have to write a short story , as Guy did . I doubt if you can write half as good a one ! " I could sense the defensiveness in Angelica 's mood which always accompanied her suspicion that people were being too hard on Guy . Second husbands learn to recognize such things . " Why do n't you write your own story ? " I suggested . " We could bind the three together , as a kind of package deal , or time capsule , against mistakes . " " It 's just what I 've been thinking of ! " Angelica responded , with an eagerness that surprised me . " Two men could not possibly tell all of a story like Guy 's . And only one woman could have . " " Just so . " " Oh , I do n't mean myself . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I meant your Lucy . She knew everything . " " All , Lucy . " " But failing her , the three of us might have a fling at it . " Angelica went straight to work the very next day , but although she started at a great pace she was constantly revising and tearing up sheets of paper , and in the end the job took her six months . For a while , I was glad to have her occupied , for she had been restless ever since the doctor , on her seventieth birthday , had made her give up riding , but as the weeks passed I began to fear that there was something obsessional in her frantic scribbling and ripping . When I suggested that she give it up , things became a great deal worse . " I 'm not going to leave poor Guy to your tender mercies , thank you , " she said tartly . " A lot I care for your bankers ' codes and lofty rules . Guy had no more to do with all that  --  fundamentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't live  | in your world , or in mine , for that matter . He tried to do right , by his own lights . " She looked at me now with the dark , resentful eyes of Guy Prime 's wife . " You 're all so high and mighty about him . Evadne , particularly . I daresay her boys will be , too . Well , I 've got to find a way to make them feel poor Guy . She paused , to speculate on her method , and seemed to forget for a moment that I was there . " I wonder if my mother did n't have the key to Guy . She had an extraordinary instinct about people . But if she did , why did she ever throw us together ? Could n't she have seen it would n't work ? " I knew by now when it was best to leave Angelica alone . Besides , I could not help her with her problem . I had a big enough one of my own . Out of my countless memories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the growth in him of the hate that led him to place his fingers on the jugular vein of the world that had nurtured him ? I decided that I could only tell the story in terms of the imprint upon myself of a growing awareness of his character and motives . When I had my thread , I was able to write the memoir in a week 's time . I would have taken less had I not remembered Angelica 's warning that I had to " persuade . " For the boys ' sake , may I succeed ! 2 . To GIVE the reader some sense of the strong initial impact that Guy made upon me , I should explain the depression into which my spirits had fallen at the time of our first meeting at Harvard . He speaks sarcastically of the little book that I had privately printed for my son George about my " rectory boyhood , " and it may be true that I made too much of the serenity of my parents '  | home . I wanted my descendants to know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its reward in this world as well as the next . But in the greater candor of my old age I will confess that it was not always so . My father , it is true , elevated by the three pillars of faith , naivete and a habit of depending on others to take care of the practical problems of life , breathed a fine , clear air of which he was constantly urging his family to partake , but my poor mother , who had to market , cook , sew and clean for a family of ten and to be the lady of the parish as well , was too occupied for many such inhalations . It is a bitter truth that sheer hard work can dry up some of a mother 's love , or at least the expression of it , and I am afraid that our home was a bit ; i arid even for my austere tastes . As a natural defense , when in later years I encountered demonstrative affection between parent and child , I was inclined to regard it as stagey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my first two years were a terrible drudgery . I had a series of part-time jobs : in a laundry , in a bakery , in a tutoring agency . Working one 's way through college was not then as systematized as it later became , and the odds were against the student . When Guy first thrust himself on my attention , I was virtually at the end of my rope . The illness of a younger sister had obliged my father to withdraw even the meager allowance that he had been making me , and although nobody at home ever suggested it , I had the uneasy feeling that I ought to leave college and help out . It can be imagined with what sullen eyes I witnessed the antics of my future friend , then in his golden prime . I must be fair . I will admit that Guy , in our junior year , was as handsome as he himself claims . His was a glorious youthful presence , of high color and high spirits , and a charm that only a churl could resist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sought me out or what he wanted of me . It was not , as I first suspected , to do his term papers for him , for he had good enough  | marks of his own . It was not for my friends , for I had none . It was not even for my companionship , for I worked too hard to have much of that to offer . Was I , then , a kind of charity case , or did he wish to learn how the lower orders lived ? If he sat next to me in class or followed me across the yard afterwards , bubbling with questions about Keats or Browning , I would be curt to the point of incivility . But nothing seemed to rebuff him . He was impervious to hints , and even I was not enough of a churl to go beyond them . Then came the affair of the economics prize and Guy 's intervention to obtain the early news of my winning it . Of course , I was overwhelmed . Who would not have been ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still warms at the memory of his imaginative generosity . I was grateful then to accept his proffered friendship , and when I took time from work to discuss the world and its company in his rooms or to drink with hint in Boston bars , my conscience was somewhat quieted by the thought that I was paying a debt of gratitude . Guy in those days was the best company imaginable : he seemed never to be itt a bad mood , never to lose his fascination in the passing parade . It was before the day of popular psychiatry , and I slid not pause to speculate what tensions might lurk under so persistently sunny a surface . His conversation was intimate , but never unpleasant , mildly impertinent and extremely funny . Ile mocked my somber moods , my inhibitions , my small town prejudices , but affection always glowed in his raillery . I was too proud , too reserved , to give that much of myself in friendship , but his example taught me that this was a lack and not , as I had primly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living . In handball , in squash , in dining , in drinking , in reading , he was unaffectedly strenuous and enthusiastic . I can still see hint lying in my window seat on a hot May day , one foot dangling out the open casement , reciting " Tamburlaine " in a stentorian voice that attracted a little crowd of students on the grass outside .  | Is it not brave to be a king , Techelles ? Usumcasane and Theridamas , Is it not passing brave to be a king ' And ride in triumph through Persepolis ? ' How I hear that voice ! The students may have laughed and even whistled , but not too much or too meanly . There was something disarming in Guy 's spontaneity , and then , too , he had a quick temper and quicker fists . For all his colored vests and dandified airs he was very much of a man . I lc was also very much of a ladies ' man , both in the drawing room and at the stage door . His activities in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he been less of a diplomat . I was inclined to be prudish and would have taken offense had Guy , like most college youths , boasted of his triumphs . But his charm never failed him . He won me to his side by professing to be ashamed of his fleshly weakness and to admire my chastity . I blush to think of the pompous sermons that I must have delivered to him , but I doubt if he laughed at me , even up his sleeve . He must have regarded me as a kind of talisman to protect him from becoming the frivolous creature he was afraid of becoming . Seeing him in the company of the sober and industrious Reginald Geer , would not people have to weigh their judgments ? Might not some of that dark sobriety even rub off on him ? Guy was terribly keen to have me meet his family , and he finally prevailed upon me , with the help of a railway pass , to visit him in Bar Harbor the summer after junior year . I found his father even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be bothered to conceal his small opinion of his son 's unprofitable new friend . Mrs. Prime , however , a soft sad gentle invalid , made up for his brusqueness in the sweetness of her welcome . I t was almost as if she were looking for friends who would stand by and steady her son when she was gone . I was touched ,  | too by Guy 's devotion to her . There was nothing put on about this . One had only to see the tears start to his eyes when she had one of her coughing spells to be convinced of his utter sincerity . Like many American men , Guy was at his finest as a son . The great event of my visit was meeting Marcellus de Grasse , who owned the big hill on which the Primes ' villa stood . Our first encounter was as disastrous as Guy relates . I went back to the Primes ' , thinking there was little to choose between my host and the crotchety " malefactor of great wealth " ( I knew all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least was a fine-looking older man while Mr. de Grasse , with alabaster skin and dyed auburn hair , hook nose and humped back , struck my youthful eye as an old woman . I was sure that nothing would induce me to accompany Guy on another visit to the top of the hill . If he enjoyed the company of such economic fossils , he could enjoy it alone . Then came the beautifully hound copy of Social Statics with its handsome inscribed apology , and I was dis:n-ned . At Guy 's suggestion I went alone to thank Mr. de Grasse and received a second and even more gracious retraction . " You must learn , my dear young man , the obligations of your generation to mine . You have to keep us from freezing . Everything in my life conspires against fluidity : my seniority in the office , my female household at home , my intellectual isolation in a money-grubbing era . Small wonder that I have become a petty tyrant ! But what particularly ( listresses inc about last Sunday lunch is that I put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What , after all , have I to do with the Harrimans and the Hills of this world ? My grandfather outfitted a frigate in the War of 1812 as a gift to the nation . I betray my essential self in taking sides between the cops of government and the robbers of business . I am an observer , Mr. Geer . Help me to preserve that detachment ! " And so a lifelong relationship with my future boss and part-  | ner began . I had been exposed to some great teachers at Harvard : Copeland and Santayana and William James , but only as a student . Never in my short life had I been in close contact with a mind as richly informed and as speculative as Mr. de Grasse 's . Banking was only a small part of his interests which ranged from the excavations at Knossos to the possibility of life on Jupiter . The quality of detachment that he feared was shriveling within him seemed to me , on the contrary , his most enduring characteristic . Indeed , it was to increase with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let me record to his credit , although it worried me at the time , that he objected less to Franklin Roosevelt than he had to Theodore . In the end our roles were reversed . He was the one who tried to argue me out of a sullen conviction that the New Deal was pure iniquity . When Mr. de Grasse wrote , in the fall of senior year , to invite me to come to work for him with Guy after our graduation , I went through a sharp emotional crisis . It suddenly seemed to me that it was all too slick and too easy , that I had betrayed the principles of my Puritan forebears and sold my birthright for a meretricious success . Did I even exist any more except as a little brother of the rich ? And had it not , perhaps , been deliberate ? Was all my churlishness of manner any better than a fawning coyness ? Had I not pined for the Prime luxury from the beginning and set my snares to catch Guy 's attention by the crude expedient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a cold shoulder ? So at least his father had thought , as I learned from Guy 's memoir . How surprised Percy Prime would have been had he known that I shared his suspicions of myself ! For a week I tormented myself with doubts and questionings , and at last , unbeknownst to Guy , who regarded my attitude as simple hysteria , I wrote to Mr. de Grasse to ask for an interview and made the trip down to New York , which I could ill afford . I think Mr. de Grasse thoroughly enjoyed that interview . I  | remember how he rested back in his swivel chair before his huge mahogany table of a desk , littered with jade figures , with carved ivory junks and beasts of burden , with everything , it seemed , but ink and paper , and made a church and steeple with his long fingers . " That question , my dear young man , is characteristic of your generation . You do n't want anything that you have n't earned . But can you define earning ? Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this life ? Is it for our toil or our integrity or our family tree or simply for our beaux yeux ? " " Well , I admit , sir , there 's chance in any career , but I hate to feel you 're offering me a job only because of Guy 's parents . " " Guy 's parents ? Bless my soul , I do n't even like them ! At least I do n't like his father . IIe 's the very worst sort of parasite , the kind that thinks himself a good citizen because his reputation is as unstained as his shirt front . " " Well , because of Guy , then , " I muttered , embarrassed by so telling a description of a man in whose house I had been a guest . " Because of Guy ! You think , then , that I staff de Grasse Brothers at the behest of young men who happen to be summer neighbors ? " " I 'm sorry , sir , " I said , coming to my senses at last . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I shall be happy to accept your offer if you still want a greenhorn who wastes your time with silly questions . " " Impertinent ones , too . For do n't you know , Rex , that I myself was the boss 's son , and my father before nte ? We do n't talk about pull and family influence at de Grasse Brothers . At least not in the office of the senior partner ! " I was so confused now that I could only rise and mumble a second incoherent apology . Mr. de Grasse , however , seemed to wax more ebullient with my embarrassment . " Sit down , my dear fellow , sit down . I still have n't answered your question . " When I was again seated , he stared at me with  | twinkling eyes . " You want to know why I offered you a job . I offered you a job because I think you have brains and character . Because I expect you to go far in de Grasse . I fully realize that this is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prospective employee . I should emphasize the magnitude of the task and your slender qualifications . But I know that as a true New Englander you are far too guilt-ridden to be carried away by compliments . If you could see how wretched you look now ! " " I am grateful for your confidence , sir , " I stammered . " I shall work my hardest for you . " " Work for yourself , dear boy . Do n't worry about me . And now I 'm going to tell you a secret . It is not you who owe your job to Guy . Before I met you , I was thinking of suggesting to him that he might not , after all , be cut out for a banker . But when I saw that he had the intelligence to pick a friend of your caliber , I concluded that he must be more serious than I had thought . " " Oh , Guy can be very serious , sir . " Mr. de Grasse did not answer this . He continued to gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell me about my friend . " I have never been entirely fair to Guy , " he said . Then he picked up a small bronze Antinoiis , which I later learned was the work of Cellini , and gazed at it pensively for some seconds . " Guy is a very beautiful human being . He has not only beauty of body but beauty of heart . I have seldom known a more generous or outgiving nature . As you know , my home is full of women . When Guy presented himself , quite of his own accord , as a kind of summer son , the charm of the prospect was irresistible to me . He has an amazing way with older people . He does n't seem to be even aware of the difference in years . I was able to teach him a good many things , but nothing to what he taught me . " " What could Guy teach you , Mr. de Grasse ? " " What I am . " The long white hand fluttered for a moment  | over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not care about beautiful things as much as I thought I did . Or about beautiful people or about beautiful hearts . He taught me , quite unwittingly , that what I really care about is beautiful minds . And Guy does not have one . " He sighed and seemed to appeal to me for a merciful judgment . " Guy bores me a bit , that 's the trouble . And it 's my fault that he bores me . He 's never pretended for a moment to be anything he was n't . But why must he fix his affections where they ca n't be returned ? " From the silence that followed I understood that Mr. de Grasse 's question had not been entirely rhetorical . " Surely he does n't always , sir . " " But I suggest he does ! " he snapped back in a voice that surprised me . " I suggest that Guy is a perverse little moth that will always desert the rich linen closet of his natural inheritance for the deadly heat of the candle . " I began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meaning that you 're a candle , sir ? " I asked more boldly . " And that you 're one too , young man . And that candles get blown out , if moths are big enough . " " Is that what moths want ? " " Moths do n't want , " he retorted . " Moths are moths . I 'm an old candle and can look after myself . But it takes some looking , with Guy . He knows where to have one . Ile knows , for example , that I love to play the wise old Rosman emperor to a worshipping young tribune . He sees one seeing myself as Marcus Aurelius , aloof , way up above the niob , reading books in my box at the circus . Oh , he has my number ! " " And mine ? He has that too , you imply . " " Ah , that 's where he 's really subtle . " Mr. de Grasse chuckled , with more than a touch of malice . " Subtle by knowing when to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country parson must see the great world ' as wickedness . As Sodom and Gomorrah . And that he will be fascinated by what he most expects : a can-  | vas of cupidity and vain sacrifices . A Hieronymous Bosch . Guy knows how to call a Baal a Baal ! " Being young , I thought that this was merely a sample of the kind of advice that older people felt compelled to give to younger and to which it was the bounden duty of the latter respectfully to listen . Indeed , I believed that the giving and receiving of such exhortations was of the essence of a proper relationship between the generations . But I never really considered that such warnings were meant to be acted upon . All the dragons that I feared were out in the open and had to be killed with spears . I had not yet met the kind of which Mr. de Grasse was speaking . 3 ? GuY 's VERSION of what happened between me and his cousin Alix Prime is perhaps the most distorted portion of his narrative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the facts , but rather a fantasy of what actually happened , nursed by his vanity and resentment in the lonely years at Panama . His description of Alix as a doll has some physical truth . She had creamy , blemishless skin , an oval face , beautifully waved golden hair and large , blue eyes which , probably because of a slight thyroid deficiency , might have been described as " popping . " She was pretty but , except when talking , curiously lacking in animation . Guy suggests that I fell in love with her looks . It was not so . What attracted me , quite against my better judgment , was something of which he as a cousin was totally unconscious . It was a sense of urgency under Alix 's candy-box cover , a vivid hint of feeling in her giggle , an intensity behind her blue  | stare that made a man think the very things that may have put that near-panic in her eyes . Alix had great sex appeal , even if she had no idea what to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have attracted me , her conversation would have done so even less . On my first visit to her home I thought her the dizziest , most empty-headed creature I had ever met and the very prototype of what , in my bias , I considered the New York debutante to be . When I was invited , as I left , to come to tea the next day by her large , noisy and surprisingly friendly mother and when I heard myself actually accepting . I felt that I must have taken leaves of my senses . Was this how the devil of the big city caught one ? It had never occurred to me that I would trot down the primrose path in full awareness that I was making an ass of myself . The Chauncey Primes ' house on Fifth Avenue was certainly the grandest I had ever been in . At last I could appreciate what Guy meant by the " poverty " of his branch of the family . It was a four story Louis XIII hulel , of red and white brick with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ des Vosges , handsomer than its Fifth Avenue neighbors , but with an interior made dreary by the gilded opulence of the era . I sat with Alix , away from the older people at the tea party , in a stiff little parlor that opened on the empty ballroom like a summer hotel porch on the ocean . She chattered on , nervously and pointlessly , about opera . I observed that I did not care for it . " But why not ? " she asked in astonishment . " I thought everybody liked opera . " I muttered something about : silly plots and sad endings and received a spirited lecture . " But operas are supposed to have tragic endings . If they did n't , they would n't be operas . They 'd be musical comedies . In opera everything is just the opposite of ' the way things are in real life . The characters sing , to begin with . What would you think of me now if I suddenly jumped up and led Mamma 's  | friends in a rousing chorus ? That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let your emotion out ; in real life you keep it in . At least , the people one knows do . And in the end the hero or heroine , or both of them , die , to show us the make-believe is over . Then we can get up and put on our wraps and go back to the real world . " " Is it a better one ? " " That depends on what you want . " Oh , yes , she had thought it all out . " Things happen to characters in opera . Wonderful things and terrible things . But somebody has to die in the end . In real life nothing very much happens . " " But we all still die in the end . " " Yes , but it 's different . It 's not apt to be so violent . " " Which do you prefer ? " I asked , beginning , in spite of myself , to be intrigued . " The opera or real life ? " " Oh , real life , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? One is always supposed to prefer real life . Besides , who wants to die violently in the end ? " " Even for a handsome tenor ? " " Not I. " She giggled suddenly . " I prefer bassos . Except they 're usually fathers or villains . Do you prefer sopranos or contraltos ? " " I 'm afraid I do n't get much chance to tell . A decent seat to the opera is a bit stiff for a first year clerk in de Grasse , and I 'm not enough of a fan for the peanut gallery . " " Oh , but I 'm sure Mamma would be delighted to ask you to come in our box ! We go to all the matinees . " The life that Alix led was considered a highly restricted one , even for those days . She took no courses , did no charity work and spent most of her time with her female Prime cousins . On Saturday afternoon after Saturday afternoon they overflowed the Chauncey Primes ' opera box like violets in a red vase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecstatic comments . As no Prime ever threw anything away , I am sure that  | there are still bundles of these in attics in Newport and Southampton with such finely flowing marginal comments as : " Sembrich magnificent ! Ten curtain calls . Gladys  --  Manuela  --  Alix ? Mamma  --  Miss Pym . " How I see them again , those bright-eyed , gushing , overdressed Prime girls , so romantic , so earnest , so idealistic ! One might have thought that they were too soft and gentle for a hard world , but that would have been because one did not know how much of that world they owned . They did not forget it . Look at them today . They may no longer have their looks or their figures , but they have still their fortunes and , more curiously , their ideals . The American heiress is as tough as the heir is weak . Except Alix . Alix was always the except ion to every rule . She was more childish , at nineteen , but she was also more sensitive . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her small daily occupations . She knew her opera plots , down to the last villain 's disguise and the last lady 's maid 's lament , and loved to talk about them . I had not been to the ( : haiuirey Primus ' more than twice before I realized that people treated Alix specially . They listened to her in the patient way that people listen to a temperamental and difficult child . The surface of her calm was a brittle one and covered a murky , perhaps even tumultuous adolescence . As I have already said , it was before the days of popular psychiatry , and young girls who suffered from what is now called " manic depression " were simply sent to their rooms , or to country estates , until they were in a more presentable mood . Guy 's mother , who struck me as having " nerves " herself , was the one who warned me about Mix . " She 's been different , ever since she was a child . First way up and then way down . Gay as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and of course my brother-in-law fancies that any young man who looks at her is after her money . " " How horrible ! "  | " Well , I daresay some of them are . " " But Alix is an enchanting creature ! " I protested warmly . " She does n't need money to attract a man . Ca n't he see that ? Ca n't her mother see it ? " " Oh , Amy sees things through her husband 's eyes . Even when her heart tel Is her otherwise . " Guy 's mother was right about this . Mrs. Chauncey Prime was not what she seemed . Everything about her appearance suggested a " no nonsense " attitude , a brusque but kindly straightforwardness , a large capacity for pulling aside confining drapery and letting in air . She was big and plain and hearty , and she used her parasol , like a terrible duchess in an English parlor comedy , to poke young people and summon them to her side . But what in reality was this paragon , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a craven creature who trembled at the frown of the insignificant man whom she had made rich ? I was to find New York society full of such paradoxes . I went on three Saturday afternoons with Alix and Mrs. Prime to the opera before I was asked to meet their lord and master at Sunday lunch . Chauncey Prime was a smaller , dryer version of Guy 's father , similarly immaculate , but instead of holding himself straight he hunched his shoulders and shook his head in endless exercise of an endless capacity for disapproval . He did not once evince the smallest interest at any topic of conversation at lunch . " I hear you work for Marcellus de Grasse , " he said to me gruffly . " I suppose you 're a great admirer of his . All the young men seem to be . " " I le has a great imagination , sir . In fact , I doubt if any man has a nobler concept of the role of capital in modern society . " Mr. Prime grunted . I should have guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had married his money could afford to admire only the bare fact of its possession . " De Grasse may be all very well , " he continued , " but he be-  | longs to a bygone era . Men like Rockefeller and Carnegie could buy and sell him twenty times over today . He puts me in mind of a baronet in a powdered wig poking about in a steel foundry . " " But surely capital is n't only a question of quantity , " I protested , perhaps too warmly . " Is n't the great thing to know where it 's needed ? A few dollars in the right place can still make industrial history . And I think de Grasse Brothers , with their flair for this kind of thing , will he around as long as your Rockefellers and Carnegies . Perhaps longer . " Mr. Prime gave another grunt and addressed no further remarks to me for the balance of our meal . If there was one thing he hated more than enthusiasm , it was an enthusiastic young man . Alix walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fifth time I had seen her and the first that we had been alone . I was mortified to find that I trembled so that 1 could hardly speak . When I took her back to her house we had not exchanged a word that could not have been spoken in the presence of both her parents . Yet I was sure , from her own constraint and averted glances , that she was in trouble , too . All my life I had fancied myself in charge of my destiny . One day , of course , I would marry , and my bride would he Lucy Ames , or a girl much like her . What I had never seen or wanted to see in my cards was an heiress . Yet here I was , choked to incoherence by my passion for a rich girl whom I did not even admire ! Why in God 's name was love called blind ? I saw every fault in poor Alix and every disadvantage to me , by my peculiar lights , of her worldly advantages . To do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of what my life should be , she fitted even less into the Primes ' picture of what she should be . Indeed , there seemed to be no pictures where she did fit . She dressed and talked more like someone playing a society girl on the stage than a society girl . At first I  | had suspected her of sarcasm , but better acquaintance routed this theory . Her nature was not rebellious . In fact , the very key to her character might have been in her absolute submission to the world in which she found herself . I doubt if it ever crossed her mind to question the validity of her father 's rule or the point of her family 's gilded vacuous existence . Yet this did not mean that she was lacking in character . Even her younger sisters , who were inclined to make fun of her , did not laugh when Alix 's tone rose to shrillness . There were certain things she could not bear : she would clap her hands to her ears at any tale of physical brutality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her greatest distress was that her sensitivity made her useless in any kind of hospital work . Sometimes it seemed to me that she clung to the world of the Primes only because it was so insulated from horror , that she picked her way across the carnage of the universe without daring to look down . But that was what distinguished her from the others . She knew that the carnage was there . Something had to happen . I could not go on so . If I could not speak before Alix alone , I had to speak before others . One Saturday afternoon in that cold early spring , when I called at the house , I saw the tall maroon Daimler parked before the door and met Mrs. Prime and Alix coming out . They were going calling , and Mrs. Prime , in her usual friendly fashion , asked me to join them . She probably had not expected that I would accept , as calling was a ladies ' pursuit , but I abruptly decided that this was my moment , and jumped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove off . Mrs. Prime was dropping cards on the people with whom she had recently dined and on the people who had recently dropped cards on her , and in the smaller society of that day she could dispose of as many as five in a single street . She had a footman as well as a chauffeur , a not uncommon circumstance for the rich of that ostentatious era , and we sat in the back of the car , I on the strapontin and Alix and her mother on the  | cushioned seat , while the footman climbed the long stoops with the little envelopes . The lady of the house usually had the tact not to be " in , " but occasionally she was , which would be signaled by a nod to the chauffeur , who would turn to alert Mrs. Prime , who would sigh and grumble and gather up her skirts to descend . It was wonderful what the fashions of 1909 did to romanticize this simple bourgeois scene . Mrs. Prime 's stalwart figure carried well the straight sweeping lines of silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ostrich feathers , while Alix , demure in a white blouse and plain black skirt seemed absurdly young and very sweetly filial . I think to this day of that street of cluttered brownstone stoops under a slatey April sky as the quintessence of romance . While Mrs. Prime was making one of her calls , Al ix must have felt the contagion of my mood , for she asked me : " What on earth can you be thinking about ? You look as pleased as Daddy when someone asks him a genealogical question about old New York . " I burst out laughing . " I was just thinking that I 'd like to go on doing just this , forever and ever ! " " Leaving cards ? " " Yes ! " " You must have taken leave of your senses . I should have thought it was purgatory for a man . " " Alix , " I exclaimed with sudden gravity , leaning forward , " do you ever feel moods of wild , senseless , violent happiness ? " She studied my face curiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had taken my hand on a beach , before a cold green ocean , and said : " I 'll try it if you will . " " I do n't know that I do , " was what she actually said . " I 'm not even absolutely sure that I would want to . Are you feeling one now ? " " Yes ! At this very moment ! I love this street and this motor car and that silly little black muff of yours . " " And is it fun to love such things ? "  | " Well , of course it 's more fun to love people . " " People ? How can one love ' people ' ? " " Not people , then . You . " Alix drew quickly back . " Now you 're going to be what Mamma calls ' silly . ' " " Silly ? I 've never made such sense in my life ! Do you want me to sing it ? Then it might be like one of your operas , where things happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a chant . " Alix Prime , I love you ! " " Oh , good heavens , do you want the whole street to hear you ? " She leaned hastily forward to place her fingers on my lips . " Please , Rex . Things happen in opera , but you forget what I told you . People die in opera . " " But they live first ! " " I suppose that 's only fair . But hush . Here comes Mamma . " " Mrs. Prime , " I exclaimed , as we drove off , in a loud , clear and I fear rather pompous tone , " I want to persuade you that I love your daughter and that I seek the honor of becoming her husband ! " " Alix , is the man out of his mind ? We hardly know him ! " " I 'm afraid he is , Mamma . " I was so exhilarated that I could only laugh again . Mrs. Prime , red and flustered , looked in bewilderment from me to Alix , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive around the park . " I do n't know what to say to you , young man . If I had the brains I was born with I suppose I 'd stop the car and put you out . Or even call a policeman . Imagine proposing to a young lady while she and her mother are dropping cards ! " " I 'll do it any other time you say ! " " Well , at least you 're open . Not all the young men who come to the house are . Indeed , some of them are very devious . . . " " Mamma ! " " I know , I know , everyone thinks I 'm much too frank , but  | I 'm simply trying to help you , my dear , that 's all . Of course , your father must n't hear a word of this . It 's much too early . We must keep it strictly between the three of us . " " Keep what , Mamma ? " " Well , your engagement or whatever you call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the third time and then covered her face with her hands . " Really , this is all too mortifying . " " Let me straighten things out , Mrs. Prime , " I intervened . " There is no engagement , of course , secret or otherwise . Alix has not admitted any preference for me at all . She probably ca n't abide me . " " Oh , Rex , I like you very much ! " This threw us all into greater confusion . " I mean any special preference , " I insisted . " All I want is for your mother to know how I feel . " I turned resolutely again to Mrs. Prime . " I can not come to your house any longer tinder false pretenses . I want Alix 's family to know that my intention is to urge her to become Mrs. Reginald Geer . And I want to make it perfectly clear that I 'm not a fortune hunter . It may take Inc years before I can properly support Alix , but I 'd rather wait those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Please ! " Alix cried with a despairing voice . " Must we talk about money already ? " " It might be best , " I continued , " if I went back to the house now and had an interview with Mr. Prime . " " No ! " both ladies cried in unison . And then I discovered that for all Alix 's seeming vagueness and for all her mother 's bustling confusion , they could be very efficient when they acted together . There was no irresolution in their joint attitude that whatever problem I might present , it was one to be solved by the distaff side of the family . The female of the species is much less snobbish than the male . Mrs. Prime and Alix did not really care a rap about the Prime social  | standards , but , with the innate conservatism of their sex , they were perfectly willing to dress me up to look like something of which their old rooster would approve . They were even willing to regard the dressing process as a sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car that afternoon that I was committed to Alix , that Al ix was in no way committed to me , and that none of us should tell Papa anything . It served me jolly well right for putting myself in their hands . Now I am sure it will have struck the reader , as it vividly strikes me in recalling these ancient events , that it was a very odd thing that I should not have told Guy of my love affair . After all , he was my landlord , my business associate , my closest friend and the cousin of my beloved . Insofar as I had a home in the city , he had provided it . Yet it is nonetheless certainly the case that not only did I tell him nothing , but that I took the utmost pains to conceal from him what was going on . I remember not being sure myself why I was so determined about this . It might have been the unconscious flowering of the seed of doubt that Mr. de Grasse had planted . It might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my New York life , to owe him my romance as well . Or it might have been , more simply still , an old New England feeling that love was a weakness better kept to oneself . But whatever that instinct , it served me well . It was a pity that it should have ever been betrayed . 4 ? NOw COMMENCED a curious , unreal phase of my life that lasted only a few months but that was unlike anything that I had experienced before or was to experience after . I continued for the rest of the spring to call faithfully at the Louis XIII hotel .  | Sometimes I went driving with Mrs. Prime and Mix up Riverside Drive to Grant 's Tomb and back ; sometimes Alix and I would walk in Central Park ; sometimes we would simply sit in two chairs looking over the empty gilded ballroom and talk . Alix was alternately friendly and agitated , and she continued to forbid me to make love to her . It was horribly frustrating . I could not even kiss her . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that it may take years , " she would protest in tears . " Then what is the hurry ? Why ca n't we go on like this , being good friends ? Why not , Rex ? " " Is that all you want ? " " It 's all I want now . " " Why do n't you come right out with it and tell nme you do n't give a damn about me ? " " Because it 's not true ! I like you very much , Rex . You know that . " " But do you think you can ever love me , Alix ? " That 's the point . " " Yes , I think I might learn to love you , in my own way . Maybe I do now . But how can 1 be sure it 's your way ? " " What 's the difference ? " " But do n't you see , that 's just what I do n't know ! " she wailed . " And if I do n't know , how is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me be the judge of that ? Kiss me , Alix . " " Oh , Rex , there you go again . And you told me you would n't ! " " For God 's sake , Alix ! Have you no heart ? " It was about this time that Guy discovered my romance , much in the manner that he describes , except that the language which he used about Alix , and for which I knocked him down , was almost obscene . It is perfectly true , however , that he took up my cause after that and that the little houseparty at his parents ' in Bar Harbor was of his own engineering . I had not seen my  | own poor family in a year 's time , but I did not hesitate to chuck my plans for a vacation with them and hurry instead to the enchanted island of Mt . Desert to await the arrival of Alix and her mother . I felt a bit guilty about using Guy 's hospitality solely to promote 1ny courtship , but I swallowed these feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I tried to make it up to hint by doing all the things he liked : by playing tennis and climbing his favorite mountains and accompanying him without a murmur on his social calls . But all this broke up with the arrival of his aunt and cousins . Mrs. Chauncey Prime was , to say the least , a discombobulating houseguest to her less affluent in-laws . She came with a motorcar , three daughters , a chauffeur and a maid , and another maid followed by rail with the trunks . She brought presents for all , which simply filled the Percy Primes ' modest villa with tissue paper , and , as Guy put it , her very apologies seemed to contain further strains on his mother 's limited household . But poor Guy 's greatest disgust must have been having our strenuous tennis singles turned into a giggley foursome and our mountain hikes into chattering strolls before tea . I will have to admit that he behaved like a brick . He was even nice to his sister Bertha , then a large , easily perspiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had developed an unfortunate crush on me and was inclined to be grabby about my company when the four of us did things together . On our walks Guy would lead her ahead so that I might be alone with Alix , and in tennis doubles he always picked his sister for a partner . He even made the supreme sacrifice of looking after Bertha at dances so that I might be free to devote myself to Alix . I could appreciate the extent of his unselfishness in that he had once told me that to be seen dancing with a plain woman was a disgrace amounting to torment . Yet nothing seemed to work with Alix . From the very beginning of her visit , which coincided with a spell of foggy weather , her spirits wilted . With each day she lost more of the chirping  | gaiety that had characterized her in New York . If I asked her what was wrong , she would only respond with a feverish cheerfulness that nothing was . And worse , despite all Guy 's valiant efforts , I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took Bertha ahead on a walk , Alix hurried to catch up with them . When we danced together she affected to be too intently following the music to pay attention to what I said . One evening I got her away from the others after supper and took her for a stroll in the small neat garden where Guy 's mother occasionally puttered . When we were quite out of sight and earshot of the house I turned on her . " Would you rather I went away ? " The look of immediate distress in those bulging blue eyes would have silenced anyone but a lover . " Oh , Rex , how can you say that ? " " Because I 'm obviously making you miserable . " " No ! " " What is it then ? We were happy iii New York . Vhy ca n't we be happy up here ? " " Oh , we were happy in New York , were n't we ? " Alix clasped her hands , as if begging me to confirm something that she no longer quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gone on forever ! " " Well , we can always go back there . But what is it about Maine that changes things ? " I seized her hands , and she was so troubled that she allowed it , but when I moved closer to kiss her , she jumped back . " What is it , dearest ? " I implored . " What is it up here that changes everything ? " Her voice dropped to a whisper . " Guy . " " Guy ! " Mine rose to a shout . " Ilas Guy been bothering you ? " " Oh , no , he 's been kind , terribly kind . IIe 's been darling , actually . That 's the trouble . " A hideous suspicion lit up my darkness . " You do n't mean he 's been making love to you ? " Alix seemed even more distressed at this . " Oh , Rex , silly ,  | please stop imagining things , or I sha n't be able to talk to you at all . Guy has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you see ? He was always the jolly cousin who pulled my pigtails and made fun of me as a stupid little girl . And I adored that ! We all adored Guy . And now he 's so different , so serious , so respectful . I hate it ! " " Shall I tell him to leave you alone ? " " In his own house ? How can you ? " " Oh , I can . " " But do n't you sec , Rex , he 's right . He 's absolutely right ! " I shook my head in confusion . " Right to be respectful ? " " No , no , no . Right to be serious . He thinks it 's not fair for you to be engaged to me without my being engaged to you . And it 's not ! " I breathed in relief . " Well , there 's a very simple way out of that one . " " No ! " Alix 's tone was near panic . " That 's what he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want ! To be engaged ! " In her fear she actually caught my arm . " I do n't see how I can tell you this , but I do n't want to be all those things that Guy says I ought to be . A woman and a wife and so on . Oh , Rex , help me ! Rex , be my one friend ! " It was not the lowest moment of my life , but I think it was probably the lowest moment up until then . At last I began to have a suspicion of how ill the poor girl was . But I was young and in love , and it followed that I was hopeful . Could not Alix be led gently out of her shadowland by a man who loved her enough ? Patience was what was needed , and I had plenty of time . Had I not promised myself that I would not marry until I could afford a bride ? And even now , decades later , I do not know that a psychiatrist would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given time , might have found happiness . I am convinced that Guy 's later supposition that she was in love with him was the merest fatuity . Even if she told him to stop  | playing John Alden , I see no reason to infer that she meant anything but that Miles Standish should speak for himself . I doubt that she had even read Longfellow . As a matter of fact , I doubt that she had ever read anything but Gustav Kobbe 's The Complete Opera Book . I assured her now , as gently as I knew how , that she did not have to become engaged before she wanted to , that she was perfectly free , if such was her choice , to live and die in single bliss . When she seemed calm again we went back to the house , and later that night , in our shared bedroom , I tried to persuade Guy to alter his behavior towards her without telling him of her psychic disturbance . I was not very successful . " You mean I 'm to pull her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she does n't have them any more . " " All I mean is that she liked being treated the way you used to treat her . " " Being kicked around ? " " If you want to put it that way . " " Look , pal , I do n't want to put it any way . I only meant to oil the wheels for you , and I seem to have been using glue . You say Alix finds me too respectful ? " " Well , too courteous , perhaps . " " And she wants to turn back the clock to t he days when I used to pie her bed and drop ice down her neck ? " " Maybe not quite that far hack . " " If you 'll let me offer a word of advice , my friend , I think you 're going about it the wrong way . ' I'I-is idea of having to be able to support Alix before you marry her is tommyrot . By the time you 're able to pay for a girl like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's the point ? Money is n't what she needs ; she 's up to her neck in it . It 's a husband she wants ! " " I wish you would n't talk about Alix 's money , " I protested . " How can I help it ? Can you think of a palm tree without palms ? Let 's face it , old boy . You 've got to supply the imagina-  | Lion that Uncle Chauncey lacks . He ca n't understand that you 're just the son-in-law he wants , and he never will , until you are that son-in-law . He 'll be tickled pink some day to see Alix married to the senior partner of de Grasse Brothers . But you have to put the cart before the horse . " " Really , Guy , you 're too absurd . " " I tell you I know what I 'm talking about ! Alix 's castle must be taken by storm . " " I think you 'd better let me do things my own way . " " Very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad temper . " You 're on your own , boy . From now on I shall leave you and Alix strictly to your own devices . " Which I accepted . It seemed to me , all in all , probably the best course of action . In the days that followed , Guy abandoned our foursome and resumed his place as the shining center of the glittering youth at the Swimming Club . Bertha hung on to Alix and myself , but , as three could not play tennis , she had sullenly to spend some of her time on the big dark veranda where her mother and aunt knitted and chatted most of the day . When Guy came home he hardly spoke to Alix , beyond a few civil words . Indeed , he played his new role so well that his father criticized him for neglecting his houseguests . Yet Alix 's humor did not improve . Left more alone with me , she became even more uncommunicative . She must have understood that I had spoken to Guy , and this , I supposed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in three days ' time when she could not tolerate the least personal remark . She would raise her hands to her ears and repeat over and over again : " Let us please , please talk about the weather ! " I finally welcomed Bertha 's company . At least , Alix relaxed when she was with us . I began at last to make out dimly what it was that she feared . It was not so much what Guy said or did as what she conceived him to be expecting of her . So long as he had treated her , however mockingly , as a child , it helped her to think of herself as a  | child . But now , whether he talked to her or not , he still constituted an audience , and presumably an impatient one , sitting out in front before the closed curtains . And what was the play but the oldest of romances , the princess and the swineherd ? When the curtains parted , should the audience not see her , in a golden robe and a golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot that led to a golden destiny ? What was next to happen must have come to Alix like the clapping and stamping of that audience out front as she shivered behind the still-lowered curtain , knowing that she had no lines . We were sitting late one afternoon on the porch , I reading ( yes , I could always read ) while Alix , with her remarkable talent for doing nothing , was simply looking at the view , when Guy joined us . For a few moments I was only vaguely conscious of his sitting there , staring from one of us to the other . " You two take the cake ! " he exclaimed at last . " What cake ? " I asked . " Here you are on a beautiful clay in a beautiful place , young , healthy and without a care in the world , and what do you make of your opportunities ? Sit here and mope ! 7'emJ ) us fugit , I tell you . " " And what should we be doing ? " I demanded , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a game of tennis . " Why , anything else ! " Guy threw up his hands . " I never saw two people more in love wlto did less about it . " " Shut up ! " I cried . " What should we do about it ? " Alix demanded now in a high , strained voice . She was staring with a fixed horror at her cousin . " Elope , you dumbbells ! Elope and wait for a ' come home , all is forgiven ' letter . I promise you 'll get one , if I have to send it myself ! " Alix gave a little cry and fled into the house . I turned hotly to Guy who raised his hand immediately to silence me . " I know , I know , " he said coolly . " You 're going to suggest I mind my own  | business . But this is my business . You have made it my business . Do n't worry . She 'll come around . Someone had to do something . " Alix came down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its usual if unsatisfactory flow . On the next to last day of my vacation , however , she complained of a migraine and retired to her room . That evening her mother showed me a wireless that she had received from her husband . " The Wandering Albatross " was en route to Bar Harbor . " But is n't that a change of plans ? " I exclaimed . " Oh my , yes . They were n't planning to go further than Ilesboro . " " You meant they were sent for ? " " My dear boy , I do n't know ! " I could see that she was agitated , even frightened , and I went to look for Guy . I found him in his room , smoking a pipe and reading , and the picture of his ease unreasonably provoked me . " Your uncle and Commodore Thompson are coming to Bar Harbor ! " I cried . " Do you suppose your father sent for them ? " " My dear fellow , why would he ? " " Because he suspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " My father is many things , Rex , but he is not obvious . Sending for Uncle Chauncey would be obvious . " His suavity at such a moment infuriated me . " Did you , then ? " Guy was on his feet in a moment . " Is that what you think of me ? " I turned away sullenly . " I do n't know what I think of anybody , " I muttered . " Why should you want a cousin of yours to marry anyone like me ? It does n't make sense . " " I 'll try to remember you 're under a strain , " he said coldly , " and that you no longer realize what you 're saying . "  | " Well , who did send for him , then ? " " Why did he have to be sent for ? Could n't he have come on his own ? Daddy may have written him , quite innocently , that you were here . Could n't he put two and two together ? " " You assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is coming because of Alix ? " Guy shrugged . " Why else would he come ? He loathes Bar Harbor . That much we all know . " " And you assume too , I suppose , that she will pack her bags and jump on the yacht as soon as he gives her a nod ? " " Do you think she wo n't ? " " Oh , I 'm not thinking any more . Except that it was a bad day when I first got mixed up with you Primes . " " Thanks , pal . " I did not fall asleep until the morning , and when I awoke it was past nine o'clock . With an immediate sense of disaster I looked over at Guy 's bed and saw that it was empty . Jumping up and going out to the porch , I found him , in his pajamas , peering out at the harbor through a pair of binoculars . As both hillside and water were enveloped i  --  fog I asked him irritably what he was looking at . He handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bay there was a large clearing , and framed in that clearing , like a marine print , long and low and as ominously white as Moby Dick , lay a great steam yacht . " The Wandering Albatross " As beautiful as death ! Has your uncle cone ashore ? " " Oh , no . Newport is the only dry land Uncle Chauncey ever touches in cruising . People go to Uncle Chauncey . He does n't go to them . " " People ? " When Guy simply shrugged I repeated harshly , " People ? Meaning whom ? " " Meaning , if you must know , that I saw Alix leave the house  | fifteen minutes ago . Aunt Amy 's car took her off towards the village . " " Well , what 's wrong with that ? Is n't it perfectly natural for her to go to see her father ? " " At this hour in the morning ? When even God has never seen Uncle Chauncey before ten ? And why did she take two suitcases and her maid ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flung on my clothes and dashed down to the dining room where , as I had dreaded , I found a pink envelope propped up at my place . " Dear Rex , " her stiff little note ran , I am joining Papa and Uncle Sidney for the rest of their cruise . I have thought things over very carefully , and I am convinced it is best this way . At some rather later time , I hope that you will come to see me . Until then , please accept my gratitude for your kind opinion of me , as ever , Aux PRIME . Guy 's memory is correct about my rowing out to the yacht , but it is wrong about my being refused permission to board . I was received at the gangway with perfect good manners and told that Mr. Prime would see me in the lounge . The fact that he did not own " The Wandering Albatross " and was aboard simply as his brother-in-law 's guest , Alix 's father managed , in the inimitable fashion of the Primes , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a small , hirsute , bustling man , had been somehow reduced to the position of a chartered skipper who took his great boat up and down the coast for the delectation of Chauncey Prime and who had remained a bachelor only to swell the inheritance of Prime nieces . When he had led me down a spotless white corridor to the broad white lounge where Mr. Prime , in a blue blazer and gleaming white flannels , was seated , he was asked , like a privileged inferior , to remain .  | " Please , Sidney , stay with us , " Mr. Prime enjoined him . " I prefer to have a witness . Now , Mr. Geer , will you kindly state what is on your mind as briefly as possible ? We are anxious to get under way . " I stammered out that I loved his daughter and wanted to marry her . I said that I fully realized that in my position I must appear presumptuous , but that I hoped to rise in the world . I told him that I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might see Alix alone to say good-bye . " But has my daughter not written you ? " he interrupted testily . " She has , sir . But under the circumstances I feel that her letter came more from you than trout her . " " You imply that I used force ? " " Only strong influence . " " I must always be the villain , must n't I , Sidney ? " Mr. Prime demanded of his brother-in-law in a sneering tone . " I must always be made out as slamming the door on true love because I ca n't see that the swineherd is really Prince Charming in disguise . You saw the state Alix was in when she cants abroad this vessel . Was it her ogre of a father who had causal it ? " " Hardly , Chauncey . You 've been at sea with me for the past month . " " Exactly , Sidney , thank you . I 've been at sea . And I 'm still at sea , Mr. Geer , " Mr. Prime continued wrathfully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother could have been thinking of to allow you to pester that poor child within an inch of her sanity . Look at that , if you please , Mr. Geer . " And he thrust before my incredulous eyes a ship 's form of wireless with the typed words : PLEASE , DADDY , COME AND GE ME . " I suppose I sent that to myself ! No doubt , you may think so . But I can not afford to have my conduct guided by your hallucinations . No , indeed , I will not permit you to see Alix , either now or later . So long as she chooses to make her home with me  --  and she still does , sir , and of  | her own free will  --  there will be no further visitations or harassments from you . Now , sir , will you please go ashore ? " " May I not even say good-bye to her ? In front of you ? " " You may not . " " You 're afraid of what she might say ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I beg of you , sir . Let me see her . For five minutes ! " " Never ! " " I insist ! " " Must I ask Commodore Thompson to have his crew put you forcibly off the yacht ? " It was then that the regrettable scene occurred that so much mortified Guy and his father . I left the yacht of my own accord , but I rowed around it , shouting Alix 's name , hoping that she might at least appear at a porthole . She did not , and I was almost hysterical when I finally came back to the Percy Primes ' . Guy 's father told me with white-lipped disgust to pack my bag at once , and so my visit to Bar Harbor was concluded . Some sores always remain partially open , no matter how much time goes by . I have never gone back to the beautiful island that Champlain named , most appropriately to my way of thinking , for its " desert " hills . Guy never knew that Alix , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I blush to record this in view of the accusation that in my anguish I had flung in his teeth . I should certainly have told him when I wrote my letter of apology , but I was too proud to confess that my beloved had had to send for her father to get away from me . I yearned for the satisfaction of seeing Alix and myself as a pair of star-crossed lovers . But what happens to " Romeo and Juliet " if the heroine rushes from the balcony to arouse old Capulet ? And if Tybalt , her fiery cousin , is on Romeo 's side ? Poor Tybalt ! I did him a grave wrong . Guy had put himself wholeheartedly at my service ; he had toiled as best he knew to  | make smooth my course of love . It was not really his fault if he had set Alix 's and my romance in a gilded frame that was precisely the one to terrify her most and to paralyze my powers of courtship . Guy put gilded frames on everything . Mr. de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had meant well , and I hurt him cruelly , first with my accusation and later with my refusal to take it back as completely as it was in my power to do . I should have eaten my silly pride and stayed on in the New York apartment that he and I had shared . But instead I allowed myself to harbor a grudge against him for being a Capulet , and that grudge was all the deeper for being both unuttered and unjust . 5 ? I WENT BACK to New York and to a shabby boarding house , where I hugged my disappointment . I rejected all distractions and immersed myself in my job , day and night . Alix went abroad . She wrote me that her father had decided to spend the autumn in London . I Icr tone was distant , her news all of Windsor Castle and the Tower of London . There was no further reference to the bond that had existed between us . Mix had evidently accepted her father 's veto , as Guy had predicted she would . What else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that I , too , could accept it . For a while there was a dins comfort in my hopeless love , a grim consolation in my sense of life 's injustice . Over the dusky desert of that first year of unremitting toil the memory of Alix rose with the pale radiance of a Ryder moon . But my darkness could not last forever , and in the early morning of my renewed and youthful normality I was ashamed to discover that Alix was becoming a rather thin presence in my disloyal sky . I found  | that the Alix who had explained to me the incredible plot of II Trovatore seemed hardly credible herself . Again and again I would invoke the scene in the motorcar on that April day when Mrs. Prime was leaving cards , but although I saw Alix 's mother and the chauffeur and even the footman , I found it harder and harder to recapture the image of Alix herself . She began to seem as fanciful as a childhood game in the dry masculine world in which I was living . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then , of course , there was Lucy Ames , who could have been defined in opposites to poor Alix . Lucy had come to New York to make a career as a secretary in a law firm ; she was the best of the new type of young woman  --  independent , capable , inexpensively but smartly dressed , jolly , a good sport and glad to spend an evening at the theater in the top gallery or a Sunday afternoon in the Metropolitan Museum . Lucy was pretty without being beautiful , sensible without being dull , and , ultimately , loving without being cloying . She had been in love with me since she was a girl . I can admit that without fatuity because she always told our son George so . Lucy made me everything that I became in life , and if she caught me , as she used to relate , on the rebound , it was the rebound of waking up to life from a dream . We were engaged a year later , when I went abroad to be Guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when we talked , seated together at the bridal dinner , it was as if we had met for the first time . Had I once been in love with this tensely chattering , archly staring society girl with the high silly laugh ? It was in another country , and besides the wench was dead . Later , when Lucy and I were married , I took her to call on Al ix in the Louis XIII hdtel on Fifth Avenue . As we came away I told her how odd it seemed to me that our hostess should have inspired such seeming depths of feeling . But Lucy shook her head .  | " No , 1 can see it . There 's something very appealing in her . She reminds me of that song about the bird in a gilded cage . You want to let her out , but what would happen if you did ? Would n't she be pecked to death by street sparrows ? " " Like me ? " " Exactly ! Oh , she loved you all right  --  she still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's afraid of you . Afraid of what you might be like when you discovered what she was like . When you stopped seeing her through a misty lover 's haze . " " But I did n't see her through a haze ! I always saw her limitations . Basically , she did n't want love . Love was for opera . Basically , she was relieved when Papa came to rescue her and take her away from the bassos and tenors . " " Maybe . But could n't she have wanted to be a soprano ? Was it her fault that she had no voice ? Or thought she had none ? Which reminds me , when you were getting your hat , she asked us to the opera next week . It 's La , Snnnambula . " And , indeed , we went to the opera witli Al ix and her mother , not once but several times . Alix seemed determined to relabel me as a piece of candy and ( it me back into her candy-box existence . Sitting behind her as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the stiffening of her spine how much she gave herself to this warbling world of make-Relieve , I felt the last drops of my bitterness drain off to expose the dregs of my male egotism . For the sadness of what happened to me was nothing to the sadness of what had happened to Alix . The crisis of her life had been resolved against her . She was never to have another chance . As she grew older she became less fee and more , like her sisters and cousins , encased in the mannered friendliness of the Prime women , a polite and seemingly democratic formality which blocked any kind of intimacy or real understanding . Alix made much of Lucy and myself and asked us to dinner parties at the Louis XIII hotel , where her father would grudgingly accord me  | a " howdy-do , Geer " and her mother would seat me at her right , no longer , alas , because of her bibulousness , a very desirable place . We were asked to the opera and to visit at Newport ; we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this meant was that we were admitted to the babble of her seeming confidences , which were not confidences at all . Poor Alix had become at last what Guy had always claimed she was : a doll . Yet behind her mask was the same susceptible heart . I had not , as it turned out , inspired a life-long passion . When Alix was twenty-nine she fell in love with Alfrederick Fowler , one of those morose , blocky young men of good but undistinguished New York families to whom our rich burghers love to entrust their daughters . Freddy Fowler 's reluctance to ingratiate himself with the Primes was taken by them for integrity and his perennial boredom as immunity to the ordinary temptations . Besides , Alix was getting on , and even her father would not have cared to frustrate her twice . Fowler , whose worldly qualifications were little more than mine had been , was given , almost without the asking , the hand that had been so rudely torn from my loving grasp . Even so , it might have worked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can strike the husband of the American heiress : ambition . He decided that his pride required that he become as rich as his wife . But no man can make a fortune just because he wants one , and Freddy Fowler was doomed before he started . He lost his own money and all of his parents ' . He did not lose Alix 's because he never got his hands on it . A Griselda in everything else , she was her father 's daughter when it came to the cash box . She tried to help him in other ways , but she had no ideas beyond those supplied by Primes . What did Primes do ? They entertained . Very well , she would entertain . She would fill her house with important people and make her husband look like an important man . Unhappily , she accomplished the very opposite  | of what she sought . Freddy felt the irony of playing a part at dinner that he could not play in the office , of watching his creditors sip his wife 's champagne and having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could never have cadged in the day . It was a surprise to nobody but Alix when he shot himself in a downtown hotel . She came near to losing her mind , but in the end the Prime discipline carried her through . In her middle years Alix turned back again , this time for good , to the companionship of her own sex ; it was the opera box filled with cousins as I had originally seen it . She lunched on regular occasions with Lucy , but to me she came now only for business . It was to my care , after her father 's death , that she consigned her fortune , and I was able at last to do something for her . I was able to turn her from a woman who was simply rich into a woman who was excessively rich . Had I made her a gift of a new book of opera plots , I could not have given her a more useless present . 6 . Guy MAKES OUT our relationship in that first year at de Grasse Brothers as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself as a society will-o ' - the- wisp , blown from hostess to hostess without motive or plan , and me , disappointed in love and unknown to the gay world , as a surly ( trudge whom it was charming of him to befriend . But one night I discovered the quantity of calculation in his social maneuvers . The surprising thing about his grasshopper was that , all the while it appeared to be lost in song , it should , like a very different insect , have been weaving a web . It was a Saturday night , and he was dressed for one of his  | grand dinners , but he always went first to a bar in the old Waldorf , near which he lived , for a Martini cocktail and a dish of oysters . He had persuaded me that evening to join him there , and leaning against the bar , beneath the huge Bouguereau of a satyr teased by naked nymphs , his evening cloak open to show his white shirt front and pearl studs , he seemed absurdly youthful and at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , personifying the dandy of the Edwardian era . " My father has a dream . Shall I tell you what it is ? " " To see you make the greatest of all the Prime matches . " Guy 's smile approached condescension . " How little you two understand each other . No , Father has poetry in his nature that you would never suspect . But the dream , will you hear it ? " " I can hardly imagine that I play a role in it . " " That depends on my role in its realization . If I tell Father : Rex and Guy , it 's a package deal , then a package deal it will be . " " But what is the deal ? " Guy raised his glass to the nymphs in the painting . " Our own firm . Geer &; Prime . Our own office . Our own seat on the Exchange . Say the word , and Father 's ready . He has the capital already pledged . " All my life I have suffered from an unwillingness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infantile sense that gratitude is somehow self-betrayal . . I had no interest in Guy 's father 's dream , but it would not have killed me to thank him for including me in it . Yet what did I say ? " Pledged ? By all your uncles ' wives , I suppose . " Guy 's eyelids did not flicker , but for a moment his features assumed the peculiar blandness that meant that he had been hurt , or at least puzzled . His tone , however , was mild enough . " Does it matter where he gets the money ? It 's honest money . " " And what would be the business of Geer &; Prime ? " " Well , I suppose we 'd have brokerage for a base , " Guy replied  | apologetically , for he knew how I felt about that . " It would be our bread and butter until we got on our feet . But I would take care of that ; you would n't have to be bothered . I 'd pick up enough accounts if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yonkers ! " " Greater love hath no man . And what would I do ? " " All the rest . " " The rest ? " Guy described a wide half-circle with his left arm . " The whole point of the firm . The capital . The guts of Geer &; Prime . That would be yours , my friend . To do what you wanted with . Investing . Loaning . Underwriting . You 'd be a one-man de Grasse Brothers . Do you know that between us we could go to the top of the financial world ? " For a moment I was intrigued . I had to admit that his scheme was designed to make maximum use of both our talents . But what it left entirely out of consideration was my love of de Grasse Brothers . I could hardly believe that he seriously expected me to give up a career of my own making to become the tool of his aunts ' fortunes . " Your family would say that having missed Alix 's money one way I was going after it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care if anyone said anything so stupid ? " Oh , your youth , Rex Geer ! Your bitter , grudging , miserly youth ! The contrast between the dinners that awaited us that night , his with gold plate and champagne , mine with a piece of cold meat and a market report , was enough to blind me to his need for a little friendliness . And yet had I not chosen my dinner ? And was not his a kind of toil ? " You 'd better go on to your party , " I said gruffly . " I 'd hate to be responsible for the least slip-up in so brilliant a social career . " And so ended , for the time being , the firm of Geer &; Prime , Guy was to mention it to me only once again .  | I was in an irritable mood at this time because Lucy would not agree to a formal engagement . I had made a clean breast of the whole business about Alix , and she had objected that my wound was still too green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it irked me to have her now stiffen in direct proportion to my availability . My irritation was not diminished , either , by the new and unexpected friendship that had sprung up between her and Guy . He had met her , of course , in East Putnam when he had visited my family , and when she came to New York he insisted on taking us out to dinner at one of those swell French restaurants where he knew so well how to play the host . Lucy was nervous about the dinner , fearing to appear a very plain wren beside this brilliant bird of paradise , and indeed it seemed to me that she was just the opposite of the type of girl to attract Guy . She had no beauty , no silly banter , no interest in the New York social life , of which , quite naturally , she knew nothing at all . But when she saw that Guy was not trying to impress her with grand names and that he seemed genuinely interested in her experiences as a secretary in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that amazed me . By the end of our meal I had the disagreeable feeling that they had formed a humorous alliance against me . " I always thought I was a committee of one to keep down the stuffiness of Rex Geer , " Guy observed to her . " Now I see I 'm only a Johnny-come-lately in a field where you have been a worthy pioneer . " " But if I 'd been that worthy , there 'd be no need for you ! " Lucy exclaimed . " And here you 've had to work Rex right through Harvard and New York ! " Guy nodded with mock gravity . " My friends call me Sisyphus . " I suppose we always like a person by whom we have expected to be snubbed . When Lucy told me , a week later , that Guy had  | asked her to dine at his family 's and that she had gone , she was delighted that I was jealous . " Why , you old silly , what would your fine-feathered friend he doing with the likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was all . It 's really touching how much he cares about you . I like Guy . I like his good spirits . Though the house was rather funereal . You know , of course , his poor mother is dying . " This was indeed the sad case . Guy was not coming to the office now , but spending his days at her bedside . When I called at the house after work one evening he received me in the downstairs parlor , looking haggard and sleepless . Yet he brushed aside my solicitous inquiries to express his enthusiasm about Lucy . " She 's just the girl for you , old man ! She 's got everything Alix did n't have . If you let her go , you 're a bigger fool than I take you for ! " This was all very well , and I was touched and pleased , for Lucy in my second New York winter had become the only thing in the world for me outside my work . But I certainly did not like what seemed to be going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had taken her out alone to dinner at Sherry 's , I blew up altogether . " Guy 's concept of friendship is a bit too broad for me if it means sharing my girl friend ! " " You use the term as if you were speaking of a chattel . I 'll thank you to remember that I 'll go out with whorl I please , when I please ! " " Then you may find that ' whom you please ' does n't include me . " " You can suit yourself about that ! " " Ah , Lucy , how can you be so hard ? " " Because you 're hard , Rex ! " Lucy was immediately at her most serious and most didactic . " You 're very hard indeed . That poor fellow is in desperate trouble . He adores his mother , and  | he ca n't face the fact that he 's losing her . If going out to dinner at an expensive restaurant and letting him talk is going to help him , I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help one 's fellow man . " " So long as it 's just that , " I muttered . I tried to accept it , but I found that I could not . The next time Lucy told me that she had been to Sherry 's with Guy ( she was entirely open about it ) , I asked her if she could assure me that he had said nothing that could be construed , even by an old maid , as love making . When she laughed in my face and said that she hoped he was better company than that , I became very somber indeed . " You admit then he 's flirting with you ? " " I admit nothing ! " Whereupon we had the most serious quarrel in our lives , and when I went home , it was without kissing her good night or even arranging for a next meeting . For a week I brooded , and then , in a cold dry despair , I called at the Percy Primes ' . The doctor was upstairs with Mrs. Prime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed vague and preoccupied , and I should have sensed a crisis in his mother 's condition , but my jealousy had driven everything but Lucy from my mind . " I want an explanation . " " An explanation ? " " Of your intentions towards Lucy . " For a moment he looked utterly bewildered . " But I have n't any intentions towards Lucy . " " You 've been acting as if you had . " Guy shook his head ruefully . " You 're not really jealous , are you ? It 's too ridiculous . I suppose Lucy told you of our dinners . That 's so like her . But she 's been nothing but a Good Samaritan , you know . She 's got such a big brimming heart that I thought you could spare me a few drops of it . " " Lucy and I are not engaged , you know , " I said in my gravest  | tone . " If you and she want to go out together , of course , you 're at liberty to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Shut up , you silly ass , and do n't go on like that , " Guy interrupted me . " Lucy 's crazy about you , and that 's as it should be . I do n't say if she had n't been , I would n't have fallen for her . Hell , I probably have fallen a bit for her . What 's the harm ? But do n't worry , I promise never again to see her without you . Does that satisfy you ? " " If you 're serious . " " Of course , I 'm serious . Listen , Rex . When it 's all over upstairs , I want to go off for a bit . To the Pacific , to the Orient , I do n't know . Would you like to come with me ? Before you 're bogged down in marriage and swamped with babies ? It may be your last chance to live a little . What about it ? " " And my job ? " " Have n't I offered you a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about I any , I might have managed , with his mother dying upstairs , at least to give hint a civil answer . But I was still too bitter . " De Grasse is the place for me , Guy . I 'm not going to leave it now . Maybe your father 's dream is right for you . " Guy 's eyes narrowed in a rare expression of resentment . " Meaning that I may not make the grade in de ( ; rasse ? " " Meaning that you may not 1w the type to be a hanker . " I shrugged to lighten the effect of it . " Is that so terrible ? Does one have to be a banker ? " " You do . " He continued to stare at me , when I did not answer this , with a funny little smile that might have been the prelude to a much uglier scene had we not both become aware that someone was standing in the doorway . " If your friend can spare you , Guy , " Mr. Prime said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother needs you . " I remained alone , in what discomfort can be imagined , while  | the sound of feet above me and on the stairway gave me a horrid sense of the deepening crisis of Mrs. Prime 's condition . I can see to this day that dismal downstairs library with the bronze stags pursued by wolves , the loudly ticking , violently striking , oversized grandfather clock that seemed , with its preliminary whirrings and rumblings , to shriek for my eviction on the quarter hour . It was a maid , weeping no doubt as much for excitement as for sorrow , who told me that Mrs. Prime was dead , and I fled , leaving a scrawl of sympathy for her son . I saw Guy next on the day of the funeral . When I say that he looked very well in raven black I do not mean to imply that he was not grief-stricken . He and his father received the friends in the vestibule of the church after the service , and when I shook his hand he asked me to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone , and then he took me aside . " I 'm chucking de Grasse , " he said gravely . " I 'm going abroad for a year . Everything points to a semicolon in my life , and I may as well acquire a bit of international polish . " " I hope it has nothing to do with what I said the other day . " " Of course , it has everything to do with it . How could it not ? Are you going to tell me that you did n't mean it ? Are you going to tell me that you do n't want me to leave de Grasse ? " " But , Guy , " I protested , appalled , " what I said had nothing to with what I wanted . All I meant was that you were n't necessarily cut out to be a banker . " " I do n't understand that at all . If I like somebody , I want him with me . You and I went into de Grasse together . It was planned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay there or leave together . If you 've changed your mind about it now , it 's because you do n't want me there . " I have always been very Yankee about the emotions . I have thought of " love " as something related only to a man 's family ,  | and friendship more in terms of trust than affection . No doubt this has been because of my Puritan association of sex with the least warmth between two human beings . But at that moment , in the dark sanctuary of the church vestibule , through which the ushers were already carrying the huge floral offerings ( trust the Prime sisters-in-law ! ) that were to accompany the casket to its last resting place , I had a glimpse of a different world as Guy conceived it . Guy did not shut the heart up in boxes with labels of " wife " or " mother " ; he did not worry about Puritans , and he did not worry about sex . Love was the color scheme of his landscape , and it made mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't imagine I might be thinking of your best inter-ests ? " Guy shook his head . " No , I could n't . And with that in mind , will you look me in the eye and tell me you did n't mean what you said ? " It is hard to recall just how conscious were all cry cerebrations , but I am sure that somewhere iii the bottom of my mind was an awareness of the romantic fallacy that underlay Guy 's philosophy of friendship . If he identified himself with a friend , then what he did for a friend he slid for himself . I seem also to recall a pull in my heart , a pull of pity , perhaps even of remorse . I know that I had a sudden vivid sense of disaster to come , as if I could make out in that murky air , perfumed by the passing flowers , the presence of some draped warning figure . It was up to me  --  that seemed to be the message that flooded tiny astonished mind  --  to save this man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 191o . I could only conclude that I was being sucked into the bogs of Guy 's sentimentality . I have been called a hard man , but that is because I know when I must make up my mind . " I 'm afraid I did mean it , Guy . " He smiled dryly and shook my hand . " There you are , fella . You see ? "  | And he turned to go to his father . I was not to see him again for a year and a half , until I went to Paris to be his best man . 7 . IN ANALYZING GuY 's narrative , I am struck by the way it skips over the years between his marriage and the ultimate catastrophe : a period of more than a quarter of a century . I wonder if there may not be a peculiarly American significance in such an emphasis on youth . Was Guy at twenty-five already complete and fixed in his groove , so that the balance of his story was simply the inevitable slide down the tracks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a college reunion questionnaire . Most of it is apt to be given over to school , college and trade school , to fraternities , academic honors and athletic teams , to military service , marriage and children , all matters occurring in youth , while the bulk of life , even in many cases the passion of life , is sloughed off with : " Employed by Buckley Carpets as assistant sales manager , 1912 . Became President 1940 . " Anyone who has watched the sentimentality of a college reunion will have noticed how deeply old graduates love to indulge the dream that their finest hours occurred before they had to face the world . In Guy 's case this was particularly true . Even before his marriage to Angelica the small pilot light of his idealism had been snuffed out . I have tried to be candid in explaining my own role in its extinguishment . A defense could be made that so mild a blowing must have been evidence of a rather mild flame , but such as it was , that flame had irradiated Guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many hearts . I am afraid that his character changed with his direction when he left his youth behind at de Grasse . Before then he had aspired , in sim-  | plest terms , to be everything in the world , regardless of incompatibilities : to be a poet and a millionaire , a Don Juan and a family man , a gallant soldier on the battlefield and a general at headquarters clinking with medals . Afterwards , the attainable universe seemed suddenly to have shrunk to what ? To the brokerage house and the country club ! Now , you will say , how could that have happened ? How could a man of Guy 's parts have sunk so quickly from Shelley to Babbitt ? I can only answer that life is that way , that man is perverse . Guy was so desperately afraid of being Babbitt ( long before Lewis had even created the character ) that what may strike us now as a series of mild disillusionments may have been enough to confirm his underlying despair . But unhappily for the rest of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 1e must have passionately resented the extinguishment , by himself or by me or by fate , of that more glowing Guy , for out of the pieces of his resentment he was slowly to fabricate the engine that ultimately blew us up . I first met Angelica IIyde in Paris , whither I journeyed to be Guy 's best man , just after the time when I.ttcy had at last agreed to become engaged to me . To my horror and chagrin I experienced immediately the same violent attraction that had flared up in me on first meeting Alix Prime and that I had naively supposed to be safely channeled into the calmer waters of my devotion to Lucy . Of course , I was ratan enough by then to be in control of my words and actions , but all my thoughts and fantasies rioted about the image of this ( lark pale beautiful girl so intriguingly remote from her own nuptial festivities , like a Roman princess captured by Barbarians and forced to marry the big blond son of the God ( leader . Goth ? Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I who had betrothed myself to a gallant girl back home for whorl , despite all my respect and reverence , I felt no part of the terrible emotion that now shook me ? Angelica in later years used to pooh-pooh this . She accused  | me of making it up to accord with a myth which I was constructing that there had really been only one woman in my life . Why , she would demand , if I had felt that way , had I not broken my engagement to Lucy , who was always the soul of understanding ? Well , firstly , I could not bear to hurt Lucy , but , secondly , and even more importantly , I had decided that the savage brute within me must at all costs be put down . For what but a brute in the course of a single year could have proposed to two women and fallen in love with a third ! I had no idea then what protracted continence could do to a man , and I concluded that I was a lost soul whom Lucy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Lucy might be better off not having to cope with the kind of passion that Alix and Angelica had aroused ! Remember , reader , those were different days . In New York , after Lucy and I were married , I took care to see as little as possible of Angelica . This was not difficult , as she and Guy were very social , and it was made even simpler by what seemed to be Lucy 's instinctive aversion to her . " You 'll have to accept it , darling , " she told me . " I ca n't look at a woman like Angelica Prime without wondering if you would n't have done better with a more elegant wife . Now , do n't tell me that underneath the beautiful enamel Angelica is the same shrinking violet I am . Maybe she is . But with women , beautiful women anyway , I have to judge by externals . That 's the woman in me ! " There now followed , despite our inauspicious beginning , the good years for Lucy and me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was constantly left to her own devices , but it was always clear that we were ascending the ladder of fame and fortune . A great esprit de corps prevailed in de Grasse Brothers that reached even to the wives , who rarely resented their husbands ' preoccupation with the " cause . " Besides , our son George , as a boy , was a delicate child and required much of Lucy 's attention . Life was full enough . Later , when the money  | came , she regretted those days , for she never cared about wealth except for her charities . And with the money came the event that darkened our existence , the loss of our baby daughter , a Mongolian idiot , whom Lucy pathetically and unreasonably adored , and the advent ( now believed to have been psychologically connected ) of her long , terrible arthritis . Guy always made a great deal of how desperately he had sought combat duty in the first war and how shabbily General Devers had treated him by tearing up his applications and insisting to Pershing himself that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , but I could never quite overcome my prejudice , as a graduate of the trenches , against those who professed to regard our experience as the great ball of the century that it was their tragedy to have missed . If it was a ball , we had not all found it so hard to crash . ' I he Guy , at any rate , who emerged from the ashes of world catastrophe , bustling and busy , with the whispered message from Jupiter , the wink that sealed the hidden pact , the hand that propelled one out of the crowded antechamber and through the back corridor to the inner citadel , the Guy who ran errands for Mars and dined with Venus , the Guy , in short , of so many splendid facades that one felt a churl even to inquire about interiors , was the Guy of the ' twenties and of their inescapable symbols : the speakeasy and the bull market . He accuses me of wanting all the same things that he wanted , but of refusing to admit it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanting them . From the beginning of our relationship I had resisted fiercely , and at times , ungraciously , the temptation of things Prime . Actually , I exaggerated the danger of that temptation . My weak spot , as the reader should now be aware , was more in the flesh than in the pocketbook . Guy sneers at my " big dreary house , " but I would never have bought it if Mr. de Grasse had not absolutely insisted that Lucy and I raise our standard of living . So it was that , with little heart in it , we ac-  | quired the Tudor mansion on the north shore of Long Island and filled it with Jacobean furniture purchased at what we hoped were good auctions . Over the mantel in the living room we hung a Rembrandt portrait of a money-lender , a Shylockian character selected by Lucy , that turned out to be a fake . Mr. de Grasse , inspecting the premises , chuckled repeatedly and murmured " Perfect . " Of course , he was making fun of us , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chateau at Fontainebleau suggested more Nana in her prosperity than the dean of the New York banking world in his . Old New York , however cynical , had its vulgar side . I am afraid that I became even more dry and austere at this period of my life . It was my way of adapting myself to Lucy 's increasing invalidism . I was what is called " devoted , " but my devotion must have seemed at times mechanical to her . Poor darling , it was her discipline to accept it as devotion . She knew that , like many healthy male animals , I instinctively " disapproved " of illness . She would have preferred , I am sure , to have had me less faithful and more spontaneous . When infidelity came at last , as I shall record in its place , she never complained . But for the most part she had to live before the spectacle of my rather grim solicitude . She accepted it as she accepted her illness , with the gallantry that never deserted her , even when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us with the spectacle of it . At the risk of inviting Evadne 's boys to accuse me of the reckless sentimentality of a guilty conscience , I will aver that Lucy was a saint . I was particularly anxious , in this period that ended with the market collapse of 1929 , to distinguish myself from Guy . The plainness of my house was meant to redeem itself in the contrast that it afforded to the beauty of his , as my dark suits were to find their merit in their difference from his gay tweeds . I did not want my George , who was first a friend and then a beau of Evadne 's and a constant visitor at Meadowview , to confuse her  | father 's meretricious success with what I had the egoism to regard as my own more substantial contribution to the economy . What it really boiled down to ( and it hurts even now to admit it ! ) was that Guy 's constant identification of our careers and aims bred occasional doubts in my own heart as to their variety . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club , shouting at me to join him at the bar , when he passed me on the road in some glittering foreign car , even when he strode into my office , dazzling the staff with the remembered first names that he so freely distributed , I could not altogether down the ugly little suspicion that we were the same , two boys who had made good together , I with his connections and he with my " savvy , " two smart youngsters who had got more than their share of the icing on the world 's birthday cake . The only difference , his broad grin implied , was that I was a hypocrite . The depression changed ncy world . licit in ii way more importantly than by bringing the event that to Guy 's mind was forever to justify his insinuated charge . 8 . DURING THE first years of the depression I toiled as never before to keep the great galleon of de Grasse oil the navigational hazards that strewed that terrible time , and by the smuttier of 1933 , when I was beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my body abruptly signified its protest . One morning I fainted at my desk , and my doctor prescribed total rest for a fortnight . There was nothing organically wrong , he assured me , but the engine needed oiling . When I confessed that I had taken no regular exercise since 1929 , he was shocked . " Very well , " I told him glumly . " What shall I do ? "  | " I know that look of yours , Mr. Geer . You do n't think anything will do you any good unless you hate it . You want me to prescribe some repulsive kind of calisthenics . Did n't you used to ride ? " " I used to ride with Lucy . Until she had to give it up . " " Did you like it ? " " Pretty well . " " Then ride ! " So I bought a mare and went riding every Saturday afternoon . After a month I took jumping lessons at the Glenville Club , and by fall I decided that I was good enough to join @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very impressive in a black habit and tall silk hat , rode up to me . " Since when did you become a hunter ? " " Since this morning . " " Are you really up to it ? " " How can I tell till I 've tried ? " She looked me up and down and shrugged . " Your seat 's all right , anyway . Follow me , and do n't take any jumps that I do n't . " Of course , I had to show her how good I was , as though I had been twenty-seven instead of forty-seven , and it served me right that I went off at the very first one that she passed up and that I attempted , knocking my wind out and spraining an ankle . Angelica , to my intense mortification , insisted on leaving the hunt to drive me home . On the way she gave me a lecture . " There 's no reason you should n't be as good a rider as you are a banker , but you ca n't do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You 're the oldest and best friend Guy has and the only one , if you ask me ( which he does n't ) that we can really count on . I 'm the idlest woman in the world , with both children at school , so why should n't I turn you into a hunter ? You probably never want to see a horse again now , but next week you 'll be feeling differently . We 'll go out together . "  | And so it started . Soon Angelica and I were riding on Sunday as well as Saturday and , at Guy 's insistence , I moved my mare to the Meadowview stables . Guy professed to be delighted that Angelica was " taking me in hand , " and Lucy , upset by my tumble at the hunt , expressed relief that I had so competent an instructor . In fact , both our spouses seemed to nod over our weekend expeditions as if we were two young creatures whose artless innocence made a charming tableau . But I knew perfectly well that I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to persuade myself that it was ridiculous to suppose that the feelings which she had aroused in me twenty years before could be aroused so easily again . I mustered in my mind all the arguments against such an eventuality  --  my own greater age and presumably greater wisdom , the fact that Angelica herself was now a middle-aged matron with nearly adult children and , finally , the total disparity of our tastes and interests . What had I to fear from a woman who seemed to fling its my face her espousal of every principle that I despised , who embodied in her trimly clad frame the sporting life of what I considered total irresponsibility ? Obviously , everything . But by the time I realized this , idiot that I was , I was too committed to those weekends to give them up . I felt , somewhere sleep within me , a new , shocking , surly defiance of the sense of duty that had always dominated me . " What have you really had for all your work ? " the truculent inner voice kept snarling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want and a home that has become a hospital ? " Oh , I would be loyal to that home ! I swore in my odious guilt that I would be . But how would it help I.uc:y if I gave up my rides ? Never had I discussed my life so intimately with anyone as I did that spring with Angelica . She and I were well prepared for this new friendship as we already knew the important things about each other . I knew about Guy and his philanderings ; she about Lucy and her arthritis . She knew my George as well as I  | knew her Evadne . We were each hilariously refreshed by the novelty of the other 's point of view in areas which we had thought too familiar for further surprises . Nor was the danger only for me . Angelica made little effort to conceal that she found me a welcome contrast to the society that Long Island had offered her in such heaping doses . She liked my indifference to her husband 's adored Glenville Club ; she liked my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she even professed to like my stuffiness and what she called my " axeless " religiosity . " You carry out so scrupulously the mandates of a God in whom you do n't really believe , " she told me . " I find that stylish ! " I suspected ( and it was more than the wish being parent to the idea ) that she had lived too long without love . There was a candor about the pleasure that she took in our rides which had a quaint and charming innocence to it . But what happened to innocence if there was no conscience ? And did she not boast of being an epicurean ? So , obviously , we should not have gone riding together , but after only two weekends it was equally obvious that we were going right on with it . There was not even any further pretense that I was being trained for the hunt . Our talk was too important to us . Sometimes we would proceed at a walk for as much as an hour at a time while Angelica talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her house  --  and Guy . She seemed to take it for granted that I would accept any confidences , as if , in all the years of our acquaintance , we had both known that our brief and rather formal communications were destined one day to flower into this equestrian understanding . One morning as we left the stable , Guy came speeding down the driveway in his yellow Packard roadster with a very vivid blonde , one Mrs. Apsley , on the seat beside him . He jammed on his brakes , hailed us , wished us a good ride and roared on . " Guy always wants me to have a good time , " Angelica observed dryly . " He might do me the courtesy occasionally to  | frown when he sees me with another man . Just for manners ' sake . But no . He never had a jealous bone in his body . Even in the days when he cared . " " He never cares now ? " My effort to make the question casual was so clumsy that she smiled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , wo n't last . What I mean is that Guy is totally without sexual jealousy . Some animals are like that . " " Rather low forms of animals , I should say . Are you jealous of Mrs. Apsley ? " " Not in the least . But then 1 ' 111 not in love with Guy . I have n't been for ten years . But ! hire that I was jealous . Oh , yes , passionately ! I could have torn the eyes out of every girl he looked at . But he was always willing to allow me the same latitude he allowed himself . " " How contemptible ! " 1 exclaimed and kic ked my horse into a trot . I was still sufficiently coul-lsed about my emotions to hate to hear Angelica talk dispassionately about her husband . She was my heroine , and 1 wanted my heroine to be very brave , very noble and very wronged , and how could she be all those things if she did n't care what he did ? It might seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conjugal indifference , that I had nothing to gain if she still cared for Guy , but what did I want to gain ? Nothing that 1 would yet admit to myself ! Lucy had gone to Arizona for what was now her annual cure , and George was at Ilarv:ud , so that I was without the sense of a family at home to restrain me on the clay that Angelica and I had our crucial talk . Once again it started with her analyzing Guy . Her curiosity about a husband whom she professed no longer to love exasperated inc unreasonably . " I suppose the secret of Guy is that he 's always content with the status quo , " she was speculating . " Any status quo . It can be very undermining to those who live with him . One finds oneself so constantly being used . And Guy uses one in such perfectly  | good faith , that 's the devilish thing ! My house , my horses , my friends , my own mother , are always being converted into stage props for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wants us to look , as he thinks we are . And as , God help us , we may be ! Do you know that if I did n't lock my door at night he 'd probably come from the arms of Evelyn Apsley to make love to me ? As if we were a blissfully happy married couple ? Sometimes I wonder which is the dreamer ? Guy or I ? " " He is the dreamer , " I said firmly . " Your feet are on the ground . " I glanced away from her , over the meadows , to the long purple facade of her beautiful house . " So do n't unlock your door . " I sensed the embarrassment in her averted head , but I knew that she was not offended . Her remark had been wildly provocative . " Never fear . I sha n't . All that is long over between Guy and me . Tell me one thing about Guy , and then I 'll stop talking about him . " She reined her horse to a stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrowed any money from you recently ? I mean since we 've been riding together ? " I flushed very red . " No . " " Thank goodness . " Abruptly she trotted on . " That 's all I wanted to know . " " Are you having money troubles ? " I demanded anxiously . " No more than usual . Never mind about them . I count on you for sympathy , not for cash . " " But cash means so little to me ! " I protested , spurring ahead to catch up with her . When she did not turn , I let slip the last cable of my common sense . " Nothing means anything to me but youl " Angelica turned now , smiling , and reached over to hit my shoulder with her riding crop . " Pupils are not supposed to make love to their riding instructors ! " " Angelica , I adore you ! " For answer she simply kicked her horse and galloped away . All the way back to the stable she kept ahead of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the groom prevented further confidences . But I noted the high color in her normally pale cheeks . " Thank you , Rex , " she called to me cheerfully , " for a very pleasant ride ! " My car was parked at the stable , in full sight of the groom ; there seemed no way to be alone with her . As she continued to smile , I walked over to the car and got in . She waved her riding crop , still smiling , as I drove off . J ? ON OUR NEXT Monday lunch Guy looked very grave and told me that he had an important matter to discuss . For a terrible moment I thought it was going to he Angelica , but almost immediately my incredulous cars were hearing his plea for a loan of a hundred thousand dollars . With a trembling hand I wrote the check right there at the dining room table . ' 1 ' he trembling was caused by a giddy combination of relief and anticipation . The bawd is only a loathsome figure to the satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santa Claus . Ile had given me back my good conscience . Now I come to the part of my memoir where I can mince no words . Lucy was off for the winter in Arizona . Guy was " squared . " The next time I went riding with Angelica I proposed , in a dry , businesslike tone , designed to strip my words of any cheap seductiveness , that we become lovers . In like manner , if with the slightest parody of it , she agreed . Thereafter , we met every other afternoon , for a period of four weeks , in an apartment that I rented on Riverside Drive . Then our relationship was brought to a sudden close . Those four weeks jump out of my chronology as a period with  | no true part in my story , a chapter of lurid fiction irreverently inserted in a sober Victorian two-volume " life and letters , " a ballet stuck into a social problem play . It was dope or euphoria or ecstasy . It was the highest point or the nadir . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I had been and was to become again . It was Rex Geer posing as somebody else , Rex Geer so terrified of what he was posing as that , in the hours outside that furnished apartment overlooking a wintry river , he plunged convulsively into work and , when there was no work , grabbed people , buttonholed people , went into people 's offices and clubs , did anything , in short , to avoid being caught alone with his conscience . And when he came home at night he would take two sleeping pills , he , who had never taken a sedative in his life ! I staved off remorse for two of those four weeks , and then it exploded in me like a fire bomb . People at the office asked me if I was sick or in pain . Walking down the corridors of de Grasse I sometimes put my hand to my side as if to allay an agony that seemed to be physical . But I did not give up Angelica . There was never the remotest idea of that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused it . On a Saturday night at the end of those four weeks I happened to be alone , except for the caretaker and his wife , in my Long Island house . During Lucy 's absence I had given the staff a vacation . I was in the library reading , when Angelica , in a red evening dress and mink stole , appeared suddenly and defiantly m the doorway . Her hair was blown , and she was panting . " I 've left him ! " she cried . " I 've left him , and you ca n't make aie go back ! " " Did you leave your dinner party , too ? " I asked , as casually as I could , to calm her , and walked over to take off her wrap . " Did n't you tell me you were entertaining the local gentry ? " " We were entertaining all the idiots on the board of his damn club . An annual affair . And right in the middle of dinner up he jumps , with a half a bun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know how he loves toasts . He could make one in an Automat ! " Here she went to the fire to warm her hands , but in a moment she had whirled around at me . " You wo n't believe what he toasted tonight . Us ! " I gaped . " You and me ? " " Well , not quite , though he would have been capable of that , too . " She laughed , a bit wildly . " I le toasted him and me . Our marriage . He said , with tears in his eyes , mind you , that it was our twenty-second wedding anniversary and he wanted to drink to ' two point two decades of bliss . ' And he meant it , that 's what kills me . I could stand anything in the world but his meaning it ! " " Is that when you departed ? " " No , I waited till dinner was over . I did that much for him . I slipped away while the ladies were out . Ma will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she snorted at my concern for detail . " Ma is always sublime in a crisis . It brings out the Roman in her . " " Oh , your mother is there , " I said , relieved . " Yes , and she 'll keep Guy in hand . I Iclt her a note , telling her to persuade him that it would be useless to come after me . " " And will she ? " " I do n't know , and I clout caret " I busied myself now at the ( uphoard getting her a drink . For the first time in a month my mind was working clearly , however feverishly . " You propose to stay here ? " " If I may ? " she exclaimed in surprise . " If you 'll take a poor refugee in ? " But I rejected her lightness of tone . " When I bought this house , I put the title in I.ucy 's name . That was more than a legal technicality . I regard it as her home . " " Pardon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , my dear . You will spend the night . In a guest room . Tomorrow we will figure out a plan . "  | " Oh , Rex , how can you be so cold ? " Angelica 's tone had changed abruptly to one of throbbing appeal . " I respect how you feel about Lucy . I respect your delicacy . You can lock your door tonight if you want . What do I care about this house ? Let Lucy have it . Let her have all your money , too , if she wants . Not that she does , worse luck . That would be too easy . But , poor sick darling creature that she is , is n't it enough if she has the home and George and the sympathy of all the world ? Ca n't she let you go ? Ca n't you and I have a little something of what 's left of our lives ? Good God , it 's ridiculous ! Here we are living in an age of universal divorce and acting like two characters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucy , do you think she 'd refuse us ? " How well I knew she would n't ! I think that moment was the climax of my agony . For there was no escaping the fact now that I was cheating two women . Nor is there any telling how I would have got out of it had not Swain , my caretaker , appeared just then in the doorway , very embarrassed and apologetic , to announce that a Mrs. Hyde was asking for me . Angelica and I exchanged glances . " Alone ? " I asked . " Well , she 's alone in the hall , sir . But she came in a big yellow car with a chauffeur . " It was Angelica who answered for us . " Tell her to come in . And , oh , Swain , " she called as he turned to go . " Mrs. Hyde is my mother . I asked her to pick me up here tonight . " " Yes , Ma'am . " " Have I saved your reputation ? " she demanded sarcastically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in return , that you not desert me while Ma is here . " Mrs. Hyde , then in her seventies , with unwrinkled skin and white hair , dressed in black velvet with no jewelry but a small antique necklace , was more effectively feminine , more persuasively authoritative than when I had first met her . She came  | into the room as if she were making a simple after-dinner family call . She was carrying a knitting bag and paused before the portrait of the money-lender , which she examined with a tranquil attentiveness . " I 'm afraid it 's a fake , " I murmured . " Ah , but one forgives it for making such an effort , " she answered pleasantly . " I 've never seen a picture trying harder to be a Rembrandt . " " Wo n't you sit by the fire ? " I urged her . " And can I get you something ? A liqueur ? " " No , thank you . At the Primes ' one dines very well . We had everything a body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once took out her needlepoint . As she prepared to work , she cast an oblique glance in Angelica 's direction . " Except perhaps a hostess . Although in her mood , there 's some question as to how much one wanted her . " Angelica strode back to the fireplace and , putting her hands on the mantel , kicked a log back . " I'nt not going home tonight , Mother . You may as well save your breath . " " That 's what I assumed . That 's why I 've brought a night bag . " " Do you really think I need a chaperone at my age ? " " Certainly not . After the lives that you and Guy have led , it would be a ridiculous formality . I 'm thinking of Mr. Geer . From what I understand , he still has some shred of reputation left . " " So that 's your line tonight ! " Angelica swung around angrily from the fire to face her . " Well , you 're very resourceful , I will admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she continued , turning to me . " She knows just where to apply her pressure . If there 's a bit of religion left in you , she rail put on her tiara and preside over the Vatican like I.ucrer.ia Borgia ! Or if it 's society you 're afraid of , she can frown like Queen Victoria . Watch out , poor man ! "  | The old lady never flinched . " Poor man ? " she queried . " I had thought he was an exceedingly rich one . I wonder if you have discovered already with your own offspring , Mr. Geer , that children think of parents as natural hypocrites . Angelica takes it for granted that I 'm trying to reach her through you . It 's very vain of her , really . Why should n't I be capable of wanting to reach you through her ? " " Because you hardly know him ! " Angelica intervened indignantly . " You have n't seen him half a dozen times in your life . What can he possibly be to you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke with ominous mildness , and Angelica flushed . " And why should you be concerned with my victims ? " she demanded with a childish rudeness . " Have n't you enough of your own ? " Because if I bear the responsibility for my own , I must bear some for you . Surely , I should have given you a better orientation in how to live and love . " " Love ? " Angelica asked sneeringly . " What could you have taught me about love ? " " More than you think , my girl , " retorted her mother , whose tone became cooler as Angelica 's became more petulant . " You are n't the only woman who 's had to conform to a pattern in which she did n't believe or to give the appearance of loving where she did n't love . But in my day we did n't think it was necessarily a high honesty to capsize the boat and drown the crew ! " " And whom , pray , am I drowning ? Could anyone as buoyant as Guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Guy , like yourself , was immune to the perils of your social adventurousness . It is Mr. Geer who is in danger of death by water . " I-low awesome is the power of a mother , particularly the power of a mother capable of such devastating detachment ! I  | shuddered with sympathy for Angelica , standing before her terrible parent with tear-stained eyes and trembling lip , a small pouting girl again . But I said nothing , no , not even then . I was as much in the old lady 's grip as she . I knew that the drastic therapy which she was meting out was our only salvation . " Rex , tell her it 's not sot " " Yes , Rex , if I may call you that , tell her it 's not so ! " Mrs. Hyde had dropped all pretense of banter now . She knew when to drive home her points , and she was not in the least bit shy of emphasis . She struck the handle of her work bag with the top of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell her and tell me if you want to crown your career with the legalization of a double adultery . And tell its , too , if you want to acid a final chapter to the charming little book that you wrote about your rectory boyhood and call it ' I low I married my best friend 's wife ' ! " " My God , Mother , you monster ! " Angelica groaned . " Rex , do n't listen to her ! " How can I describe my feelings at that moment ? All I remember is suspecting that there would be little of me left to come out of the vise formed by the opposed wills of these two powerful women . Can I convince a modern reader that I adored Angelica and was at the same time passionately relieved by her mother 's interference ? No , that 's hardly romantic , is it ? I was a very long way from believing that the world was well lost for love . The vision of Lucy 's pain-ridden eyes was an icy hell in which the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal . I yearned for it all to be over , and , like a coward , I clung to Mrs. I lyric 's skirts . " I 'm waiting for an answer , " the inexorable old woman continued . " Yes , Rex , answer her ! " " Angelica , my dear , she 's right . You know she 's right . " Angelica became alabaster . " You mean I 'm to go back ? "  | " What else have I to offer you ? " With a little cry she turned and fled from the room . When I was going to follow her , Mrs. Hyde called me sharply back . " Rex ! I think I 'd like that glass of brandy now . The one you were kind enough to offer when I came in . " " But Angelica may do something to herself ! " " Do n't flatter yourself . Or me . She 'll be down in a minute and ready to go home . Believe me , " she said , even more firmly as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Quelled by that bleak , remotely twinkling stare I went to the cupboard and poured her a brandy , which she consumed in three quick sips . It was her only sign that the preceding scene had been a strain . " It is not easy to talk to you , Mrs. Hyde , " I said . " You must feel I have done you a great wrong . " " Not at all . In my generation , these things were blamed on the women , and not much on them unless they made fools of themselves . As Angelica did tonight . " " That is the European point of view ? " " I should prefer to call it the civilized point of view . An affair is one thing . Breaking up a marriage , or two of them , is quite another . " " It humiliates me to have to admit that your Catholic faith comes out of all of this better than my Protestant . I hang my head in shame , Mrs. Hyde . " " That will get neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Besides , my Catholic faith has very little to do with it . I am indeed a Catholic , and I believe in the teachings of my church . But I would continue to believe in its rules even if I lost my faith in its teachings . " She held out her glass . " One more tiny drop , please , and I 'll tell you something . Because I think I like you , Rex . " I poured her the drop , and she contemplated the glass as she contemplated her speech . " I may as well relieve your conscientious mind . Why , after all , should you labor under a  | debt of gratitude to me ? I did n't come here tonight to save your marriage . It was n't in danger . I did n't even come here to save you . You were n't in danger . I came here to save Angelica . " " From me ? " " Well , more precisely , to save her from the humiliation of slipping between two stools . To save her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time when it might be too late for her to go back to Guy . For it 's not too late now . Guy will overlook this episode . He is very tolerant . But even Guy has his limits . " " And what sort of a life will she have with Guy when she goes back ? " " The same she 's always had . ' 1'lw life she chose . Do n't stare at me that way , Rex . It is n't as if he beat her . Personally , I 've always liked Guy . IIe 's a good-humored man , which , as Dr. Johnson said , is a rare thing . Angelica 's always picking on him for being vulgar . Yet all he 's really doing is cl ; - hhing a badly needed spot of rouge on the poor old skeleton ul ' our universe . " She rose now and crossed the room to the door nearest the hall stairs . " Angelical " she called up in a voice as casual as if they had been late for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angelica came . She swept down the stairs and passed Inc like a queen evacuating her palace and making her prowl quick way through the jeering rebel mob . I was that ntob . I followed her and her mother out to the Porte-cocl-crc , where the Prince 11ispano and chauffeur were waiting . So even that was a bluff ! Mrs. Hyde had never expected to spend the night . She had had too much confidence in her own diplomacy to dismiss the car . I did not see Angelica for six months , nor did we correspond . When we met at last , it was accidentally , it1 New York at her mother 's , where I now regularly called . We came away together , and I walked with her to the door of the Colony Club . " I 've gotten over my hate of you , " she said in her old brusque  | way . " I might even go so far as to say that you and Ma were right . But if you so much as look I told you so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my purse and shoot you straight through the heart . Is n't that what Joan Crawford would do ? " " I do n't go to the movies . " " Then take it from me , " she said , more grimly than her seeming joke implied , " that 's what she 'd do . " " There would n't be much to shoot . I 've been pretty much in pieces . " " And to think I did that to the great Reginald Geer ! I shall have it engraved on my tombstone . To the scandalization of the Prime mausoleum ! " If that was the note she wanted to strike , I would not be the one to jangle her tune . If I suspected that a passionate resentment was still seething beneath it , I would not be the one to let it out . Humbly , gratefully , a bit shame-facedly , I picked up my cue , and from then on I continued to see Angelica , as I had seen her before our intimacy , in groups , at her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not think that , while Lucy was living and while Guy remained Angelica 's husband , we had a conversation that either Lucy or he would have begrudged us . Curiously enough , these social meetings , which might have seemed impossibly frustrating , were of immense comfort to me . On the threshold of fifty innocence was preferable to ecstasy . The reaction of each of our spouses to Angelica 's flight from the dinner party was characteristic . When Lucy returned from Arizona , I made a clean breast of the whole sorry business . She listened patiently , without a single comment , until I had finished . " You must think me very obtuse , " she said at last , " if you suppose I did n't know about you and Angelica . I do not blame you , not in my mind , anyway . My mind tells me that a healthy  | man needs love . My heart ca n't help being bitter about it . Nor can it resist a certain unworthy glee in knowing what purgatory your conscience must have made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're in pari delicto . And the best we can both do is to make a pledge not to talk about your lady loves . It 's this chatter that I find hardest of all . " " There will be no more lady loves to chatter about . I swear it , Lucy . " " Oh , my dearest , do n't make a pledge like that . I know you 're quite capable of keeping it . Do n't , for God 's sake , put me in the position of having to urge you to go and get what I ca n't give you . It 's beyond flesh and blood ! " " Lucy , my darling , listen . " I gut clown on my knees by her chair . " I am going to be faithful because I want to be faithful . Because it makes me happy to he faithful . I am making the pledge to myself , not to you . Does that make it any better ? " " Oh much better , my love . Ex ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I kept my pledge , and I can only pray that I did not hurt Lucy more that way than I would have by breaking it . She only let down her guard on a single other occasion when , years later , as she lay dying , she took my hand and murmured : ' ' I'in sorry you 're so old ! " And immediately the pain flooded her eyes at the realization of what , poor selfless creature , she must have considered an unforgivable self-indulgence . Guy met me for our Monday lunch as usual after the weekend of Angelica 's departure and return , but he made no reference to these events . Instead , he talked about his phosphate mine , in which the de Grasse loans had given inc a controlling interest . Discussion of business and little more was the characteristic of this stage in our relationship , the penult in-ate and , in retrospect , the most offensive to n-e . For I was always conscious now of a leer behind what I had once considered the simple friendliness of his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | I half expected to receive a sly poke in the ribs or some such tacit signal that we were fellows in the red plush school of deceit and adultery . I hated it , but I hated it in silence . There was nothing between us that would not have been made viler by discussion . And so I conclude this chapter that has been the hardest thing to write that I have ever written . It was made necessary by Guy 's decision to strut posthumously before his grandsons in the role of Othello . It is nobody 's fault but his own that I have been obliged to uncover his closer resemblance to Iago , who pretended that his plotting against the Moor had been motivated by the latter 's affair with his wife . 10 . WHEN Guy CAME to me in the summer of 1936 with the shameful story of the Glenville Club 's bonds , I assumed , despite his protestations , that this must have been the climax of a long course of embezzlements . I could only comprehend it as having begun accidentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the pledging of a bond thought to belong to one of them and subsequently discovered to be the property of a Prime aunt . How quickly it must have been put back in her account ! But the memory would have lingered of so simple and painless a way of raising funds in a pinch . And then , with the depression and tight money , another aunt 's bonds would have been used and replaced , always replaced , of course , and then another 's , until at last , with the passage of years and the hardening of habit , Guy had calmly appropriated three hundred and fifty thousand dollars out of a country club 's building account . Why not ? Was n't it good business ? Did n't perhaps everyone do it secretly ? Even holy old Rex himself ?  | But that was not , after all , the way it happened . Guy says that he first converted securities from a customer 's account in 1934 , only two years before the episode of the Glenville Club 's bonds , and that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculation . I have talked to his partners and gone over the accounts of his firm , and I have not been able to disprove this . Everything , on the contrary , tends to confirm the bracketing of his initial crime with the failure of his attempted marital reconciliation , and obviously I can not evade the further bracketing of this same failure with what had happened between myself and Angelica . Guy must have hated me as deeply as one man can hate another . To his inflamed imagination I had robbed him of the career that was his birthright and tossed his wife on top of the pile of my loot . The fact that he had played the role of the complacent husband had simply crowned my iniquities : it was as if by pushing him into this position I had tried to rob him of his resentment as well . In the two years that elapsed between my giving up Angelica and the collapse of his firm , the same years of his embezzlements , he treated inc with a graveled heartiness that was an almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never anything approaching an explanation between us . We knew each other too well . The peculiar hardness and boldness of Guy in this era , which was so to strike and shock the public at his trial , was much more than a melodramatic defiance of fate . 01 ( 1 Mr. ( le Grasse put his finger on it when he suggested to inc during the Congressional hearings that Guy was enjoying himself . I lc was . IIe believed that he had brought me down at last and with me de Grasse Brothers and with de Grasse the whole world of serious men who had denied him the leadership that he had so long and so almost crazily claimed . Oh , yes , he was a fiddling Nero , only a more dangerous one . Rome could be rebuilt . My Wall Street never was . I do not mean that Guy intended to go bankrupt , but that sometime in that period he embarked on a course of action that  | could have only two possible endings , both heady personal triumphs for him . Either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would destroy Wall Street . Either he would be monarch of that famous thoroughfare or he would turn it over , with grass growing in its streets , to the jackals of the New Deal . As it began to look as if the second eventuality would be the one to produce his " cloudy trophies , " Guy moved to enmesh me in his fall . It was essential to his plan that I should become his creditor , with full knowledge of his embezzlement . It was vital that I should become his accessory . He was sure , of course , that he had me in his hands . He was de Grasse 's broker and my friend and affiliate ; a scandal was bound to spatter my walls . He was well aware ( who better ? ) of my feeling for Angelica ; he assumed that I would be anxious to spare her the humiliation of her husband 's disgrace . And then , most potently of all , my only son was engaged to his daughter . Surely all he had to do was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet there was a stubborn side of my nature that might have prevailed over all these things . Indeed , Guy 's very cocksureness that he had me where he wanted me might have been enough to turn me against the loan . I have always hated to be taken for granted . But fortunately for his plans and unhappily for me , my stubbornness was aroused that day by another person . The reader will remember that I told Guy on the telephone that I would give him my answer to his desperate appeal that night at Meadowview . After some hours of frenetic selfexamination I decided to lay the case before Lucy . I left my office and drove to Glen Cove , where I found her on the flagstone terrace in her wheel chair , enjoying the early spring weather . By her side was the little table on which her necessaries were always laid : her books , her writing board , her field glasses ( she loved birds ) , her journal , and the little radio which brought her the appalling soap operas to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but without seeming surprise as I told my grim tale . " Are you going to give him the money ? " was all she asked when I had finished . It was like her to waste no time in ejaculations and laments . " Do n't you think I have to ? For Evadne 's sake , if no one else 's ? " " Forgive me if I say that 's tosh , my dear . Evadne and George can survive Guy 's disgrace . If they ca n't , there 's no stuff in them , and I think they have stuff . As for Angelica , she 's been looking for challenges all her life . Why deprive her of one as real as this ? Let 's get down to brass tacks . You 're thinking of de Grasse Brothers . Or you think you 're thinking of it . " " I 'm thinking of Guy . " " Are you ? " Lucy 's stare was intent . " I should have thought you would have been remorseless in a case like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mentioned one . " " You forget how far back ( ; uy goes into my past . " " I do n't forget how much you dislike him . Is n't it time you faced that ? And how niucli it motivates you ? You 're afraid of letting Guy go to jail because you want him to go to jail . You 're ashamed of this , so you fall back on the other - votive of saving de Grasse from being publicly associated with a swindler . " I breathed heavily . I never liked it when Lucy was coldly analytical , and , of course , she was pat ti ( ulai ly apt to be so where the Primes were concerned . IJnfortunately for me , unfortunately for everyone , I ascribed her detachment that evening to a continued jealousy of Angelica . I believed that Lucy believed that I wanted to save Guy for Angelica 's sake . " Well , of course , it 's true that the tie-in between Guy and de Grasse has always been close , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Not as much as if it were found out that you were covering up for him . "  | Oh , had I listened to her ! " Then there 's the question of his innocent partners . They 'll be ruined , too . " " What do you care about Guy 's partners , Rex ? Ca n't you be honest about yourself for once in your life ? " There was something so icy about Lucy on this occasion that it virtually resolved me in Guy 's favor . That is the tragedy of the closest relationships of life . At the most crucial moments irritation often occupies the center of the stage . Lucy did not believe that I was really concerned about Guy , and her distaste for what she considered my hypocrisy made her put her excellent advice in unpalatable form . I , in turn , believed that she would not face in her own heart a hostility for Angelica that made her welcome the prospect of disaster for the Primes . " I am sorry to give the impression of so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to my room to dress for dinner at Meadowview . It was while shaving that I conceived my plan of making Guy give up his business in return for my loan . Fatuously , I congratulated my image in the mirror on its brilliance . It seemed to me that this way I saved everybody and that I protected society into the bargain by chaining Guy up with his promise to retire . Of course , I was taking the law into my own hands , but in my conceit I never doubted that this was where it belonged . Who else , indeed , could rescue the innocent and restrict the guilty ? The law would have punished both . My resolution faltered a bit that night at Meadowview when I had to sit at Guy 's table , in the presence of his family and my son ( all , of course , ignorant of the impending crisis ) , and listen to him bandy cheap jokes about the suicide of Count Landi , whose position had been morally the twin of his own . This performance should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from business I was about to take ( or rather to exact ) had become totally depraved . But my heart went out instead to his wife and children , sitting there listening to his chatter and not knowing how close they were to a similar disgrace .  | Why then , my reader will ask , did I not watch Guy , in the summer that followed , to make sure that he carried out his part of our bargain ? I was in England , to be sure , but that was no excuse . I could still have had him properly supervised . The answer is that the very thought of Guy had become so nauseating to me that I weakly ( and I hope uncharacteristically ) tried to put him out of my mind . To explain this , I can only relate a conversation that I had with Angelica after what Guy calls the " Meadowview Pact " and before my departure for England . She asked me to lunch with her alone . She said that she wanted to learn more precisely just what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong . 1 was pleased at her interest , for I had been upset at how casually she had taken the news of Guy 's defalcations . But I soon found that she had other things on her mind . Women simply do not care as men ( arc about the morals of the marketplace . " How far back do you think these ' defalcations ' as you call them , go ? " she asked me . " As far back as 1934 ? " " But that 's only two years . " Then I flushed as I thought I followed her thinking . " You mean you think there might he a connection between what he did and a s ? " " Oh no . Between what he did and my miscarriage . " " Miscarriage ? What miscarriage ? " " Did n't you know I had a miscarriage that fall ? " Angelica took in my look of consternation and suddenly burst out laughing . " Oh no , you old silly , it was n't w , N. It was Guy all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Guy scented to mind it all so desperately , I wondered it it did n't have something to do with turning him bad . " He minded it ! I think I minded it more than the discovery of his embezzlements . How had I missed it ? Lucy must have deliberately kept it from me , with heroic delicacy , to spare my feelings . Or else she may have thought that it was my child and that I must have known . Heaven and earth ! I do not recall what  | further conversation I had with Angelica at that lunch , but I know that I allowed nothing more to be said of the miscarriage and that I tramped all the way back from Fourteenth Street to my office afterwards . Dearest Angelica , you never knew what torture you put me through ! Of course , I forgave it . Of course , I blamed it all on Guy . It seemed to me , that dismal afternoon , that he had smeared everything he had ever touched and everything that I had ever loved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see her only as an heiress and myself as a fortune hunter ? Had he not cheapened the whole trade of banking until I had had to drive him out of de Grasse ? Oh , yes , I had driven him out  --  I saw that now ! Had he not debased Angelica by winking at our love ? And had he not now cheapened her again , hideously , unbearably ? I could think of no nook or cranny of my life that had not been degraded by Guy Prime . My trip to England was like a flight from a burning city . I did not want to think about Guy or hear his name mentioned . Before I left I told George the story of the embezzlements and asked him to be my watchdog . Poor George ! Asked to watch his beloved 's father ! Besides , he was too young , too inexperienced . He did not even move in the world where he would have learned of Guy 's borrowings . I had left a puppy to guard my fox . When Lucy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Primes , but George informed me that there had been rumors of Guy 's borrowing . He said that he had reported this to Angelica and that she had told him that Guy was renegotiating an old loan that had fallen due . " An old loan ! " I exclaimed . " But surely he has dozens of those ! He should have come to us . He knows that I want to settle this whole business , once and for all . " George flushed and said nothing , and I saw that he was as unsatisfied as I. What did I expect ? How could he question his  | future mother-in-law 's estimate of her husband 's affairs ? Angelica , who did n't know a stock from a bond ! And so it was , as Guy reports , that the moment I felt his heavy hand on my shoulder at the opera , I knew that my silly game was up . Mr. de Grasse , fortunately , was in New York  --  he never went to France before the cold weather  --  and I repaired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mansion on Washington Square . It had belonged to his father and grandfather before him ( an almost inconceivable rarity in New York ) , and I wondered if the Duncan Phyfe chairs and the Paul Revere tankards would not blush at the nature of my revelations . I had telephoned from a booth of the gravity of my mission , and Albert Simmons , senior partner of Simmons , Illy &; Slater , our counsel , was there ahead of me . In the library , by a fire into which Mr. de Grasse pensively gazed , the three of us held our grim conference . I had never much cared for Simmons , and that night I came near to hating hint . He was an um tuous , soft little man with a mellifluous , never-ceasing voice , and he clasped and unclasped his fat little hands as he talked and shook his head so that the pince-nez on the thin bridge of his bulging nose was always aquiver . In a bonnet and cape lie would have looked like a clear old granny , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so aggressively . Oh , of course , he was a brilliant lawyer , but I did not need a brilliant lawyer to tell me that to cover up for Guy Prime would be compounding a felony . Had I not already done it once ? " Thank you , Albert , " Mr. do Grasse said when he had finished , or at least paused . " ' That seems to be perfectly clear , does n't it ? Let me beg your forgiveness for an interrupted evening . My car will take you home . " When Simmons had gone , obviously surprised and put out by his abrupt dismissal , having expected , no doubt , to linger luxu-  | riously over the corpse of Guy Prime , savoring the scandal , deploring the crime , rejoicing in his sense of being the first to know , Mr. de Grasse looked up at me with an enigmatic little smile . " So much for the law , Rex . Now for you and me . De Grasse Brothers obviously can do nothing . But Marcellus de Grasse is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " With sudden , burning tears in my eyes I took his thin cold hand in mine . " God bless you , sir . Of course , I ca n't accept it . Guy must go under . And I must resign from de Grasse . " " Nonsense ! " The old man had risen to clasp my shoulder . " A de Grasse partnership means more than a business association . Surely you have learned that in all these years . We stand together to the end . " " But if I 've hurt the firm , sir ? " " If you 've killed the firm , we stand by you . But , of course , it wo n't come to that . There will be a bit of a blow , and we may ship some water , but hang on , and we 'll come through . " " I still think , sir . . . " " Oh , go home and go to bed , Rex . You know you 'd feel the same way if it was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this scene that sustained me through the agonizing days that followed . When I consider what I have been to Lucy , to Angelica , to Guy and even to my poor over-indoctrinated , over-lectured son George , I can not help wondering if my relationship with this cool , cynical old man was not the one successful relationship of my life . We asked very little of each other , gave less and fully appreciated what we received . In the Congressional hearing that followed Guy 's conviction , Mr. de Grasse continued his kindness . He knew that this would be the hardest part of all for me , harder than the newspapers , harder than George 's misery , harder than all the terrible letters . He sat by me throughout the hearing and endeavored to lighten it by whispering joking comments about the witnesses  | and making fun of the zealous chief counsel for the Committee . When I stepped down after my ordeal in the witness box , he muttered : " Cohen 's a cad , that 's all there is to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to heart . " Perhaps not . But since when had I been a gentleman ? My ultimate revelation carte with Guy 's testimony . It was not in what he said , for that , of course , was well-traveled territory , but in the way he said it . Guy was what is called a good witness : grave , courteous , patient , simple and clear . It was as if he had been called as an expert on the history of Prime King Dawson &; King and was testifying with perfect detaclunent . It was difficult for most observers in that ( handier to realize that this calm , dignified , almost nnagisterial gentleman would , when the hearing was over , return to the penitentiary to serve out his three-year term . Towards his partners , his asscx iate  --  s , his iiiencls and creditors in that crowded room his conduct was perfect , ' Hwy might have been total strangers . Ile spoke lo nobody and caught nobody 's eye . When he and I passed in the corridor he looked neither through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize me . Nobody would ever have the opportunity to cut Guy Prime . As the hearing went on , as he blandly and spec ilically uncovered for our benevolently despot is government every last detail of his peculations , I began to ttudet : . t , uul the motives that I have outlined at the beginning of this chapter . I saw that I had been Guy 's tool from the beginning , lust in de ? ( ; rasse and later , when he set up his own firm , as a forwarder of business . Angelica had helped , his father and his uncles had helped , even his unhappy cousin Alix , by marrying me , was meant to have helped . Everything and everyone that ( ; try tuched , even the country club that was his dream child , had had to be molded into instruments
