Until recently , an extra six-tenths of an inch was important mostly to carpenters , seamstresses and surgeons . Now , however , that fractional distance has become an $800 million-a-year consideration to the U.S. tobacco industry . Six-tenths of an inch is the difference in length between king-size cigarettes and the 100-mm. size , the hottest new item in the tobacco business . Estimates are that the 100-mms. will get 8% to 10% of the $8 billion cigarette market this year v. only 2% last year , when they were first introduced . <P> <P> Pall Mall pioneered the popular-price " luxury-length cigarette " in March 1966 , and was followed last fall by Benson &; Hedges . The two caught on so well that other companies that had been considering the longer cigarettes rushed their brands into distribution . Along with Pall Mall , the American Tobacco Co. brought out Colony in the 100-mm. length ; American is now test-marketing Tareyton , Lucky Strike and Fifty Fifty in that size . P. Lorillard Co. introduced 100-mm . Spring and York and is testing its best-selling Kent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L &; Ms in the longer length . R. J. Reynolds has a 100-mm . Winston in menthol and nonmenthol ; they accounted for much of the company 's 3.9% increase in first-quarter sales . <P> Apologetic Approach . The longies have been pushed forward by a spritely $10 million campaign launched for Phillip Morris ' Benson &; Hedges by the hot new advertising agency , Wells , Rich , Greene . Adopting the apologetic approach to advertising that worked so well for Volkswagen and Avis Rent A Car , Benson &; Hedges ads point out the difficulties of smoking a 100-mm. cigarette . They burn beards , get crushed in cigarette cases , smashed in elevator doors , mashed against closed car windows , and one ad warns : " Please hold this magazine a little further away if you 're smoking Benson &; Hedges 100s . " On the other hand , " You 'll never have to worry about lighting your nose . " And Benson &; Hedges 100s offer " three puffs , four puffs , maybe five puffs longer than king size-depending upon how you puff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edged ahead of Pall Mall as the biggest 100-mm. seller , according to John C. Maxwell Jr. , a Manhattan analyst whose statistics on cigarette consumption are the industry 's most expert . <P> Even though tobacco men predict that the 100s will continue to account lor a growing share of market , one problem must be solved that not even Wells , Rich , Greene cares to make light of . Without a converter that costs $50 , the longer size does not fit into 900 000 vending machines , from which 17% of all cigarettes are sold . Vending-machine owners so far are not eager to spend on conversions until they are certain the 100s are not a fast-burning fad.
