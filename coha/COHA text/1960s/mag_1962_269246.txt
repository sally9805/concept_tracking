Little Denise McWhorter was only a few minutes old , but Pediatrician Spencer Snow could see that she was in desperate trouble . She had trouble breathing , and she could not swallow ; she seemed to be drowning in her own saliva . In an effort to ease the difficulty , Snow slid a tube down the baby 's throat . It stopped short , and X rays confirmed the diagnosis : little Denise has a connecting passage between her esophagus and her windpipe , and the upper section of the esophagus ended before it reached her stomach . Further examination showed that there was no opening at the lower end of the baby 's digestive tract . The X rays also suggested an abscess blocking a perforated small bowel . The big question at Salt Lake City 's Latter-Day Saints Hospital was : Would little ( 4 lb . ) Denise live long enough for a hastily assembled team of doctors to attempt an operation ? <P> Wads of Trouble . " We 'll try to keep her breathing , ' ' promised the anesthesiologist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hours after she was born , Denise was carried into the operating room . As soon as he sliced into her abdomen . Surgeon Robert Beveridge saw that her troubles were even worse than he had suspected . " Her organs looked as if someone had just wadded them in his fist and thrown them in there , ' ' he said . He drained off the abscess that was blocking the infant 's small bowel . Next Beveridge sewed a tube into the wall of her stomach so that she could be fed . After that , he performed a colostomy - looped part of the colon ( large bowel ) outside the baby 's body so that she could get rid of waste . Somehow , Denise was still breathing when Beveridge closed up her abdomen . But the operation was only half over . <P> Beveridge made another incision in the baby 's chest so that he could join the two separated sections of her esophagus-but the sections were too far apart to be sewn together . All the surgeon could do was close the opening between esophagus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section of the esophagus outside the neck to provide drainage ; Denise would depend on the stomach tube for feeding . At 6 a.m. , the second incision was closed . Denise was soon able to take in and dispose of liquids . <P> Pounds of Health . After the operation , Denise dropped to 3 lbs . 12 oz . Then she started to gain . Beveridge promised her mother-the wife of a truck driver and the mother of two normal daughters-that Denise could go home when she weighed 5 lbs . At 5 Ibs. 2 oz. , he finally consented . By last week-2 months after the operation-Denise weighed 6 lbs . and seemed to be thriving . She is not yet out of danger , but Surgeon Beveridge is confident enough to have set up a tentative schedule for further operations . By the time Denise is one , he hopes to open her digestive tract and close the colostomy ; when she is two , he will rebuild the esophagus by transplanting a loop of her intestines . Beveridge now admits : " I really never thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
