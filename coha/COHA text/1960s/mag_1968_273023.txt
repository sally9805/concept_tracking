The book is seductively titled Who 's Who in the CIA , but , alas , that turns out to be largely a cover-and little else . The work of East Germany 's Dr. Julius Mader , 40 , the author of several other , widely unnoticed exposes of Western intelligence operations , Who 's Who is a pocket-size , 600-page directory that lists more than 3,000 Americans who supposedly work for the CIA . " My book , " says Mader , " blows the lid off the American secret service . " <P> Well , not quite . Would you believe Lyndon Johnson ? Hubert Humphrey ? Dean Rusk ? Robert McNamara ? Defense Secretary Clark Clifford ? A.F.L.-C.I.O . President George Meany ? They are all in Who 's Who . So is Composer Leroy Anderson ( The Syncopated Clock ) who was , to be sure , a U.S. military intelligence captain in World War II and Korea . So are Pulitzer Prizewinning Cartoonist Bruce Shanks of the Buffalo Evening News and Phil Santora of the New York Daily News , not to mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the list too are Arthur Schlesinger and HEW ex-Secretary John Gardner , Viet Nam Negotiator Cyrus Vance and Presidential Aide Walt Whitman Rostow . <P> Some of the entries suggest that Spook-Spotter Mader is a bit out-of-date . He has Dr. Peter Howard Selz as curator of Manhattan 's Museum of Modern Art , a post he left three years ago for the University of California . He lists William Henry Hylan as a CBS network vice president ; Hylan went to the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency in 1963 and has been there ever since . August Heckscher appears as a writer on the New York Herald Tribune ; Heckscher , now New York City parks commissioner , left the Trib in 1956 , and the newspaper closed down two years ago . <P> In case his readers have corrections or additions to offer , Mader has included a blank page that can be torn out and mailed to an East Berlin post office . But one page will hardly suffice .                 @ @ @ @
