AJ a group , the symphony orchestras of the U.S. are unsurpassed in quality by those of any other nation in the world . Yet today they are in trouble - loud , unavoidable , cymbal-crashing financial trouble . In Buffalo and Rochester , the two Philharmonics are so pressed for funds that they are talking merger ; so are the Cincinnati and Indianapolis orchestras . The Detroit Symphony , which has just emerged from a 34-day musicians ' strike , is in such economic straits that it may have to disband . " Between 1971 and 1973 , " predicts Manhattan Fund Raiser Carl Shaver , an expert in orchestral finances , " we stand a very good chance of losing at least one-third , if not half of our major symphony orchestras . " <P> The facts are summed up in a new study prepared for the nation 's top five orchestras-New York , Boston , Philadelphia , Cleveland and Chicago-by the management-consultant firm of McKinsey &; Co . Because rocketing costs - most notably , sharply increased salary scales-have not been met by a similar gain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from $2.9 million in 1964 to $5.7 million in 1968 . The loss will soar to $8,000,000 by the 1971-72 season unless drastic steps are taken . <P> Into Bankruptcy . So large are the deficits that orchestras have been forced to dip into endowments to survive . In the past five years , the Chicago Symphony has had to dip into its endowment so regularly that it has shrunk from $6,200,000 to $1,000,000 . In Cleveland , the orchestra is about to tap its endowment fund for $600,000 to help meet a 1968-69 deficit of $1,100,000 . If the same thing happens next year , says Orchestra President Alfred M. Rankin , the endowment fund will be wiped out , and the orchestra built by George Szell over the past 23 years into one of the world 's finest may have to disband or go into bankruptcy . <P> The New York Philharmonic , Boston Symphony and Philadelphia Orchestra are not that badly off , but they are sufficiently worried to have joined a newly created committee of managers and orchestra presidents . A major concern is the symphonies ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract signed in April with the American Federation of Musicians . The new rules , affecting length of sessions and overtime pay , will make recording in the U.S. at least 20% more expensive , and thus may force record companies to sign up more orchestras abroad , where labor costs are lower . <P> There are a few encouraging exceptions to the battle against poverty-notably in Pittsburgh , Minneapolis , Salt Lake City and Atlanta-but the crisis situation is nationwide . Six years ago , the <P> Detroit Symphony had an earned annual income of $550,000 , which left it only $400,000 to raise to meet a $950,000 budget . This past season , the orchestra 's earned income rose to $900,000 - but its budget soared to $2,200,000 . The Los Angeles Philharmonic 's deficit of $500,000 in 1966 has increased to $1,100,000 for 1969.
