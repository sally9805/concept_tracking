For all those people who have been sincerely disturbed by Supreme Court decisions forbidding the recitation of state-prescribed prayers in public schools , Harvard 's famed constitutional law professor , Paul Freund , had some reassuring words last week . Not that Freund disagreed with the court . It is hard to see how it could have ruled any other way , he said in a lecture at Harvard 's School of Education . But the decisions , he insisted , " are more important for the doors they leave open than for those they shut . " <P> Religion , Freund reminded his audience , " is unquestionably a part of our cultural tradition . A number of the holidays we observe , the coins we take and spend , the public addresses we hear , the inscriptions on public buildings that we enter , all bear witness to the infusion and persistence of this tradition . " It is hard to see how such things can be challenged in law , he said , " so long as they are not addressed to a captive audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejection on the part of those who witness them . " <P> Schools are still free , Freund said , to teach about religion , even if they may not teach religion itself . The distinction , he admitted , is easier to point out than to practice . As for the moral education he called for , that presents " even greater subtleties . " But the need is also great . The religious aspect of education , Freund concluded , " is too important to be left to the professional educators alone . " What is needed is a collaboration , " among others , of philosophers to clarify objectives , psychologists to advise on techniques of learning , and lawyers to furnish materials from the quarries of moral decisions known as the law reports . " Asked why no ministers were included among his collaborators , Freund explained : " I do n't think there would be any constitutional difficulty about bringing in ministers as consultants . I just thought it would be more prudent , if a board or a city were interested in revising its curriculum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
