The best symphony orchestras are not necessarily the long-established veterans - and no one likes to prove the point more often than veteran Conductor Leopold Stokowski . Since he left his post as principal conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1936 , he has organized more front-rank orchestras than some conductors face in a lifetime . Now 80 , Stokowski is still up to his old tricks : in its third concert of the season last week , Stokowski 's newly organized American Symphony Orchestra demonstrated to a cheering audience that it rivals the very best . <P> The wonder of the new orchestra is that a third of its players are fresh out of conservatories . The youngest is 18 , and the group has played together no more than 30 hours . But Stokowski has an almost uncanny way of making instrumentalists play better than their best ; he is as adept as ever at juggling his seating arrangements to produce the lush orchestral effects that are now so easily recognized as the Stokowski Sound . <P> In last week 's concert at Carnegie Hall the orchestra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Epigraphes Antiques , a relaxed , singing Brahms 's Symphony No. 2 , a beautifully articulated Petite Symphonic Concertante by contemporary Swiss Composer Frank Martin . Stokowski led his 95 musicians with the surgically precise gestures of the hand , the long , scythelike sweeps of the arm that are as familiar to concertgoers as the white-maned profile . At concert 's end , in response to the cheers , Stokowski announced a " Christmas present " encore - his own arrangement of old and traditional Russian Christmas music . <P> Stokowski began to think about forming his newest orchestra two years ago . <P> <P> He started holding auditions and putting the bite on his friends for contributions . He listened to a total of 200 young instrumentalists in his penthouse on Manhattan 's Fifth Avenue , hired the outstanding performers and put the rest on a waiting list . To fill out the orchestra with more experienced players , Stokowski consulted what is probably the most extensive talent file in all music : his own loose-leaf notebook in which he has evaluated every instrumentalist and singer who has ever performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for rehearsals by last October , and wherever he could he sat the youngsters next to the veterans , on the theory that the enthusiasm of one would rub off on the experience of the other . But there is more than seating arrangement to account for the transformation of an assorted group of musicians into a symphony orchestra . Stokowski tunes differently from other conductors : instead of asking the oboe for an A by which the whole orchestra tunes , he asks for an A for woodwinds , a B-flat for the brasses , an A again for the strings . The three sections tune separately . Nor does Stokowski , like most conductors , stop the orchestra in mid-flight during practice sessions ; he plays through a composition from beginning to end , making copious notes , then consults his notes before pointing out where the orchestra went wrong . Courteous and patient with his orchestra , he is also given to sharply pointed remarks when he thinks that a musician is performing ' at less than his best . At a recent rehearsal he remarked dryly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you do n't play well . "
