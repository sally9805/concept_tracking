IDA ROSENTHAL <P> MANY a U.S. woman - and man-boggles at the flat-chested styles that occasionally spring from Paris couturiers , but no one resents them with a deeper passion than a spry little ( 4 ft. 10 in. ) grandmother named Ida Rosenthal . <P> <P> Mrs. Rosenthal , 74 , is <P> the founder and chairman of Maidenform Inc. , the chief U.S. brassiere manufacturer and the originator of the modern bra . " Nature has made woman with a bosom , " says Mrs. Rosenthal , " so nature thought it was important . Who am I to argue with nature ? " <P> <P> By helping nature , Ida Rosenthal has probably had a greater impact on the U.S. female form than all the couturiers in Paris . On any day , she estimates , 20% of all U.S. women-or 13 million-are wearing one of her Maidenform bras ; 30% of U.S. women own at least one Maidenform . In 115 countries , 20 different styles of Maidenform , dubbed with such fetching names as Arabesque , Sweet Music and Chansonette , shape the contours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the language , thanks to ads featuring women who dreamed they did everything from shopping to being a toreador-while showing off in their Maidenform bras . <P> Last week Mrs. Rosenthal , who spends 50% of her time traveling to outposts of her Maidenformidable empire , was in Europe . After hurrying through Brussels , Zurich and Amsterdam , she settled in Paris ' Ritz , gave a professional appraisal of her clients . " The U.S. woman 's bosom is getting smaller , " she sighed . " The French woman is sometimes underdeveloped , the Dutch woman is rather heavy , and the British woman needs a little help . Reality can not always be beautiful . " <P> Mrs. Rosenthal has her own version of aid to underdeveloped countries . Her fastest growing market is overseas , where traditionally braless European women are becoming more sophisticated , and women in many lands have newly emancipated themselves into Western dress . Maidenform is opening accounts even in the bare-breasted tropical islands , e.g. , in Papua and Fernando Po . Next spring Mrs. Rosenthal plans to personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like the Russian women to wear Maidenform bras , " she says . " They 'll look better , they 'll feel better , and maybe we 'll get along better . " <P> <P> SELLING nearly 10% of all U.S. bras , Maidenform last year took in $34 million , expects a 5% increase in sales this year . Most of it came from the world 's best brassiere customer , the U.S. woman . Maidenform 's average customer is 24-25 years old , wears size 34B , and frequently ( one customer in eight ) wants padding in her bra . She is also hard to please . " A woman , " says Mrs. Rosenthal , " is a very funny creature . You have to sell her the right size and right type , but what she wants to hear about is fashion . Not only do you have to be a designer ; you have to be a psychologist . " <P> Mrs. Rosenthal also believes in engineering . She keeps twelve designers busy engineering her bras at her Bayonne , N.J. factory .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
