JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY came to the Presidency committed to " get this country moving again . " With an urgent appeal that may have accounted for the difference between his vote and Nixon 's , Kennedy crusaded for a faster rate of economic growth , for instilling new hope in depressed areas , and for broad health , education , and welfare programs . Fearlessly , he attacked Eisenhower 's tight money policies and acknowledged the need for a larger governmental role in the nation 's economic life . Accurately , he diagnosed the symptoms and causes of the recession , and promised swift steps to correct it . All this suggested that Kennedy would initiate a new economic era in which the neurotic Republican fear of deficits would be replaced by a modern fiscal policy devised by the best brains available . It would be an exciting period , dominated by men of great intellect who would be encouraged to test new ideas . With half of the first Kennedy year gone , how much progress has been made toward fulfillingthis program ? On the plus side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of measures to counter recession ? a temporary extension of unemployment compensation , aid to depressed areas and to dependent children , a boost in minimum wages , and a housing hill . There has been a speed-up of tax refunds , veterans ' life-insurance dividends , and scheduled government construction . A package of key tax-reform proposals ? with more promised for next year ? was sent to Congress , as were bills for permanent improvements in unemployment compensation and social security , federal aid to education , and a medical-care program . On all these measures , except for medical care and education , partial or full Congressional action is hoped for during the 1961 session . And surely , not the least of Kennedy 's achievements has been his ability to attract talented economic advisers who have breathed new life into the Council of Economic Advisers , the Budget Bureau , and the Treasury . Yet all this falls far short of the bright promise ; the nation has had to settle for a limited program which is unlikely to result in full employment or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the specter of continuing heavy unemployment , an ugly and costly anachronism in an affluent land . The hard fact of the matter is that President Kennedy has been somewhat timid in his approach to business and finance . In retrospect seems clear that his instincts are more conserva ? rive than the tone of his campaign speeches . Furthermore , his acute sense of political realities has persuaded him to dilute some of his economic goals . Indeed the political " constraints " dovetail neatly with his own middle-of-the-road views . For example , he opposed a tax cut as an anti . recession device because ? as he frankly told his key advisers before his inauguration ? he felt it conflicted with the " posture of sacrifice " he intended to ask of the country . In subsequent discussions he also made clear his view that a tax cut would throw the federal budget too far out of balance , and that Congress would not " buy " the idea , anyway . Temporarily , the cautious approach was acceptable to liberals . The President had inherited a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new Democratic President as a careful , prudent custodian of the dollar had to be cultivated . Moreover , as Professor Paul A. Samuelson of Massachusetts Institute of Technology pointed out in January , in his task force report on the economy , " one can not realistically expect to undo in 1961 the inadequacies of several years . It is not realistic to aim for the restoration of high employment within a single calendar year . " These words set the pace for the Kennedy program , which consisted of some mild immediate measures to attack recession to be followed by a second look at the situation in the spring . And Kennedy 's Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers , Walter W. Heller of the University of Minnesota , concurred . By April there was some evidence of a business upturn , Meantime European speculators who hid up the world price of gold in the hope that Kennedy would devalue the dollar gave up their costly game . The price of gold settled back to $35 an ounce . As Per Jacobsson , Managing Director of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market went up and the price of gold went down . " Kennedy thus cleared his first hurdles . At the same time he turned aside the warnings of his Council which argued along with Samuelson that , apart from recession , there was a basic weakness in the economy . " We were sluggish and tired , " Samuelson said , and must take steps to make sure that recovery wo n't " peter omit " in a year or two , well below the nation 's capacity . This thesis was developed in detail before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress on March 6 by Heller with his fellow Council members , the quietly brilliant Professor James Tobin of Yale* and Professor Kermit Gordon of Williams College . " An economic upturn would he only the beginning , not the end of the solution to our economic problems , " Heller said . He demonstrated that our fabled productive machine was limping along at least 8 per cent under capacity , wasting resources at a rate not even the richest nation could afford . He estimated the gap between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equivalent to 5500 per household . And this calculation was based on a growth rate of only 3.5 per cent ? the sum of a normal 2 per cent productivity gain , plus a 1.5 per cent rise in the labor force . Heller thus steered away from talk of high rates of growth , although the Democratic platform had set 5 per cent as a goal , and many independent groups believe a 4.5 per cent growth rate is necessary and attainable . And certainly , 3.5 per cent looks modest when set against the recent gains on both sides of the Iron Curtain in Europe . Heller outlined the " expansionary policies required by the serious economic problems we face . " Among the possibilities were a temporary consumer tax cut , stimulation of investment in physical and human resources , more housing programs , and a strong effort to lower interest rates . There was so much slack in the economy , he argued , that government spending could be increased with little fear of a delayed inflationary * When Tobin was invited early in January to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy called him directly at Heller 's suggestion , but Tobin warned him that an article he had written for a university publication , scheduled to appear shortly . was highly critical of the Federal Reserve . Tobin thought this might be embarrassing , but Kennedy was unperturbed . Finally , Tobin said : " Senator , you do n't want rue in the Council . I 'm an ivory tower economist . " Answered Kennedy : " Thais the best kind . an ivory tower President . " impact . " We do not accept the gloomy doctrine , " Heller told Congress , " that economic expansion is inherently inconsistent with reasonable price stability and balance in our international accounts . " ECONOMIC SUGAR PILLS T HERE , in the public records of the Joint Committee of Congress , a basic program for action was laid out for Mr , Kennedy if he wanted it . But the President , bit by bit , showed himself more wary than Mr. Heller . His cautious attitude was encouraged by another topranking adviser , Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon , who felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samuelson had predicted . If so , there would be less reason for new stimuli . But the chief reason for Kennedy 's hesitancy is that he does n't want to be tagged as a " big spender . " Conscious of the political expediency of " fiscal integrity " ? a phrase Eisenhower made famous ? he also has a surprisingly orthodox concern of his own about a big federal deficit . Furthermore , the concept of " public works , " for him , smacks of boondoggling , or spending just for spending 's sake . One of his important advisers observes : " The President sets great store by the business of being considered fiscally sound ? and he is extremely sensitive to criticism from the right . " * Thus , he was stung when Eisenhower , at a Republican dinner in June criticized his policies and denounced all budget deficits as " immoral . " Kennedy 's instinct is to prove his critics wrong , which in this case implies limitations on his policies that his liberal advisers find oppressive . Criticism of Kennedy from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? at least in public . Waiter Reuther bitterly assailed the Administra- *This is evident also in areas not directly associated with spending or public works . For example , the Administration dropped like a hot potato its own plan to remove the 25 per cent gold hacking of the dollar as soon as it became clear that there would be a fight on the Hill . Representative Abraham J. Multer introduced a bill which would have abandoned this archaic requirement . thus helping assure the world that in any future dollar crisis , the entire stock of U.S. gold would be available for sale . Most modern experts , including some of the best minds in Wall Street , have long favored this step . Dillon was ready to testify for the legislation until Mutter received an avalanche of protests from arch-conservatives . Molter postponed the hearings ? and the Administration retreated , presumably unwilling to do or die on this issue . Lion in the privacy of the Labor Management Advisory Committee for losing a sense of urgency . But his and other labor leaders ' public speeches have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois and Congressman Henry Reuss of Wisconsin have pulled their punches , too , although both feel that Kennedy has been fearful of running up a big deficit , Senator Joseph Clark of Pennsylvania , who expected Kennedy to back a public-works bill he introduced , and then was left alone , out on a limb , has n't even been petulant . " We feel somewhat restrained in the use of rhetoric when it comes to one of our own , " says a lawmaker who is a Democrat , a liberal ? and a politician . The major liberal critique of the Administration program was made in May in an excellent majority report of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress . It praised Kennedy 's initial efforts , but called them " small as compared to the gap between the nation 's expected economic performance and its economic potential . " Liberals have held their fire in part because a good deal of the Kennedy legislative program has reached long-desired but hitherto unobtainable goals . Under Eisenhower , for instance , a special program for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality . And if the new minimum-wage law is a compromise , it is nevertheless a step forward . As Arthur Goldberg says with a smile : " It 's hard to get outraged at a President just because he does n't agree with everything that everybody proposes . " But while labor and the liberals have muted their complaints , conservatives have had no reason to be inarticulate . So the pressures on Kennedy have been chiefly from the right , and he appears to have concluded that neither the country nor Congress can be pushed too fast . After Kennedy 's first few weeks in office , Professor Samuelson observed : " You might say we are in the midst of a placebo program for recovery . ' " Because of his narrow margin over Nixon , and some " popular misconceptions " in Congress about a budget-balance every year , " Kennedy has put forward what is a rather modest program for recovery and growth " instead of urging " whatever ought to have been done . " " It is well , " Samuelson said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures . Even if the American economy begins to turn up by the middle of 1961 , there is little reason to think that the end of the year will find us with unemploytnent much better than at the present time . A genuine quickening of economic growth , ... even to the 31/2 to 4- per cent annual rates the economy should be again capable of , 11 have to wait until the second and third years of President Kennedy 's term of office . " Thus , in effect , Kennedy has decided that the U. S. will be allowed to limp along this year , and nerhaps next , while unemployment ranges somewhere close to ( or even above ) 6 per cent of the labor force , with a good share of the U. S. plant capacity lying tragically idle. * JOBS Ott MOON SHOTS ? T H IS policy is the outcome of a long behind-the-scenes struggle between the " expansionists " and the more conservative of Kennedy 's advisers . The former might well have come out on top had it not been for Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floundering in Laos . These events precluded a vast civilian spending program when the time came for the " second look " this spring . Kennedy still encourages the avant-garde wing of his Administration ? Heller and Labor Secretary Goldberg ? to speak their pieces in public as well as in closed session . He is quite willing for them to goad public opinion toward more decisive action ? not , however , to be undertaken this year . What happened was this : Heller at one time had a preliminary go-ahead from the President on a program keyed to Senator Clark 's bill , which proposed federal grants of up to a billion dollars for local public works . Still other federal money would have been ticketed for parks , forests , stream-pollution control , and for retraining jobless workers . Then on April 12 Gagarin took off , and the misadventure in Cuba followed just a week later . Earlier setbacks in Southeast Asia had already convinced Kennedy and the National Security Council that spending for conventional armed forces and on guerrilla tactical operations would have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been whittled down , *Studies made by Joint Committee economist James Knowles suggest that official government figures understate the unemployment problem . For one thing , the Census sample includes the self-employed , who rarely suffer unemployment in the usual sense . Moreover , the commonly used figures do n't include those who can find only part-time jobs . Making these and other allowances , Knowles finds that the Labor Department unemployment figure of nearly 7 per cent at midsummer equates to about 10 per cent of the labor force available for hire to others.went out the window altogether , when Kennedy decided that our national prestige required a massive effort to land a man on the moon and return him safely to earth . Heller and the Economic Council conceded that the accelerated military and space program would stimulate the economy , especially in future years . But for the immediate period ahead , the Council still thought some works spending was warranted . To reassure those who feared an inflationary impact , Heller proposed adding a " trigger " to the Clark bill , which would start up public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent . ( From December through July , unemployment hovered between 6.5 and 6.9 per cent of the labor force . ) But the job-retraining program was the only civilian program to survive the " second look " in May ; the President decided that $800 million for military and space programs , which would bring the fiscal 1962 deficit to $3.7 billion , was enough . Moreover , he fretted over the prospect that space projects alone will soon cost $3 billion a year . By the end of July , the Berlin crisis forced him to propose even more red ink . He asked Congress for preparedness spending that would hoist the deficit to at least $5.3 billion , Thus ( although it was guns instead of butter ) Khrushchev was partially successful where Goldberg and Heller had failed . The most influential figure opposing the Goldberg and Heller arguments was Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon . His appointment ? at a time when it was vital to establish " fiscal integrity " ? was one of Kennedy 's most adroit moves . Dillon 's name is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Republican to boot , plucked right out of the Eisenhower sub-Cabinet . The more moderate view appealed also to Theodore Sorensen , Kennedy 's remarkable young Special Counsel , speech-writer , message-drafter , and confidant . And ? although he is not part of the Administration team ? Federal Reserve Board Chairman William McChesney Martin also exerted a restraining influence during a regular . series of White House meetings with the President and officials of the Treasury , Economic Council , and the Budget Bureau . For Chairman Heller , the results of the accelerated military and space program were disappointing except for one small victory : In the " re-State of the Union " message on May 26 , the President stressed that the " full financial influence " of the government had to be exerted to maintain easy money . If Heller ( who is fond BY HOBART ROWEN 29 of calling himself a " pragmatic " liberal* ) had his way , the government would not only follow an easy-money policy , but would use its powers in all directions to influence economic growth , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an instrumentality , both the pot of gold and the rainbow . " Heller and other like-minded advisers take some measure of comfort from the President 's midyear statement that a 4.5 per cent growth rate " is well within our capability . " This , however , was more in the nature of a propaganda retort to Khrushchev 's boasting than a statement of economic policy . What are the sources of growth ? Heller emphasizes investment in what are called " human resources " ? education and physical and mental health . He attaches great importance to the recent evidence that only about half of the nation 's vastly expanded output since 1900 can be traced to better factories and machines . The other half is the result of education ? that is , more skilled labor , technological gains , and mastery of the economics of large-scale production . " We would do well , " says Heller , " to broaden our concept of social ' capital ' beyond bricks and mortar . " Heller is a Midwestern intellectual who grew up in Milwaukee and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kenneth Galbraith that " much of our affluence is being frittered away in indulgences , luxuries , and Frivolities . " But he disputes Galbraith 's major thesis that the United States is " saturated " with production , and needs only to divide the economic pie more sensibly . Heller puts a greater value on high production and employment , and on the private sector of the economy , than does Galbraith . Heller has a sophisticated grasp of the facts of life in Washington . ( He served four Years in the Treasury during World War II . ) He knew from the start that not all of his advice would always be taken and is well aware that it is one thing for the academic purist to state a theory or a goal , and another to get a program through Congress . An economist who knows this distinction 4 In Washington jargon . a " pragmatic " liberal is pretty much the same as a " responsible " liberal . which is Sorensen 's favorite description of Kennedy . During the campaign , Sorensen took pains to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others like Leon Keyserling ( President Truman 's second Economic Council Chairman ) . Sorensen , who did much of the scouting for economists whose brains could be picked by Kennedy , regards Keyserling as a " spender . " This is somewhat unfair to Keyserling , who did much of the trail-blazing on the need for faster economic growth.would naturally appeal to Kennedy , who is a politician above all else . The two met for the first time last October ? during the campaign ? when Senator Hubert Humphrey introduced them in a Minneapolis hotel room . As he dressed for a speech , Kennedy cross-examined Heller and liked his answers . When Samuelson later made it clear that he would n't leave his MIT teaching job , Kennedy called Heller to Georgetown and offered him the Council post . He promised Heller that he would revitalize the Council and that he would let him nominate his own associates. * The Heller-Tobin-Gordon team is generally rated the best assembled since the agency was created by the 1946 Employment Act . All have direct access to Kennedy , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President 's economic strategy . Kennedy at the outset told Heller that he was to develop , not short-range tactics , but a broad economic program , " in terms appropriate to the optimum development of the human and natural resources of this country . " Under this charter , Heller has tried to make the council a sort of " catalytic agency " which draws on the talents of other government departments and also prods them regularly . In building his empire , Heller relies on his own drive and ability and that of his staff and a close rapport with Kennedy . His influence is not diluted by a personal White House economic aide ( such as Dr. Gabriel Hauge in the Eisenhower Administration ) . " WHY ? " Olt " WHY NOT ?

This , in fact , has happened . Eisenhower 's Budget Director was no more than an adviser to Sherman Adams .

Bell 's role therefore is that of a consultant who carries out the orders of the President , once decisions are made . in almost a literal sense , he is an extension of the President . Where Heller or Goldberg might publicly urge Kennedy onward and upward , Bell could not and does not . Within the Budget Bureau , there is a new outlook on life . Bell has told his staff that concern with costs does n't mean that all energy should be devoted to " exterminating waste . " Instead he wants the Bureau to be concerned with the successful development of Kennedy 's program . Maurice Starts , Eisenhower 's last Budget Director , had the single word " Why ? " framed in his office . Bell 's attitude is " Why Not ?

BRAINS IN THE TREASURY A VERY different kind of influence flows from the ancient edifice flanking the White House grounds to the east . This is the United States Treasury , presided over by the chief Republican warrior on the New Frontier , Douglas Dillon . Debonair , a keen student of politics , anxious to carve out his own niche , Dillon has marched exactly in step with Kennedy . Although more conservative than some of the President 's advisers , he has confounded those wl- - feared he would throw a Republican roadblock across key Democratic programs , especially pet Democratic monetary ideas . By any impartial standard , Dillon must be ranked as one of our best Treasury * Professor Richard Neustadt of Columbia , author of Presidential Power , which is a sort of Bible of Kennedy 's , agrees with this assessment . Until leaving for a year 's sabbatical at Oxford , Neustadt acted as a part-time consultant to Bell in the Budget Bureau . Secretaries . As manager of the huge national debt , he has moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid , of course , of a first-rate group of technicians , notably Under Secretary for Monetary Affairs , Robert V. Roosa* ) . It is true that Dillon played a leading role in beating back Heller 's and Samuelson 's anti-recession , temporary-tax-cut idea . But he has also done much to develop and then defend the Administration 's 1961 tax-reform program . On tax matters he has accepted most of the ideas of another Kennedy Harvard expert , Assistant Secretary Stanley S. Surrey . Surrey had confirmation troubles on Capitol Hill because of his well-known enthusiasm for plugging tax loopholes . But he 's hard at work on an even broader tax-reform bill for next year . If any of his theories arc sacrificed to political necessity , the blame will more properly fall on the Lyndon Johnson ? Sam Rayburn axis of the Democratic party than on the Republican Secretary of the Treasury . On the touchy problem of interest rates , Dillon has so far gone along with Heller . This is noteworthy because Democrats and Republicans are historically divided by the Democrats ' insistence on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine and the GOP bias in favor of tight money as a device to control inflation . Dillon was an investment banker as recently as 1953 ( when he left Dillon , Read k Co. to become Ambassador to France ) . Eventually he may cross swords with Heller on credit policy . But so far he has supported his Democratic colleagues , who keep an eagle eye on the Federal Reserve , fearful that Mr. Martin 's central bank will cut short the recovery ( as it did in 1959 ) by turning the credit screws too tight too soon . At a press conference in April , Dillon showed some concern : " There should be no worry that this recovery is going to get out of hand . We are n't looking forward to any very tremendous budgetary deficit such as we had in 1959 . Therefore , we think a monetary policy . . . promoting ease should continue for suite some time in the future . In fact , we do n't foresee yet the time at which that would have to be changed . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1 think the country can look forward ? to a considerable * When Samuelson recommended Roosa to Kennedy , he absent-mindedly said : " Of course . he 's only forty-two . " To which J. F. K. responded : " Let 's not knock that age ! " Roosa , who had been Vice President of the New York Federal Reserve System , is considered the foremost authority on the operation of the securities market . His name is often mentioned as a successor to Martin as Chairman of the Federal Reserve System . period of monetary ease now , even though business conditions seem to he better .... " But what stunned some of his old Wall Street friends was Dillon 's declaration that a modest federal deficit was prudent and necessary to help lift the country out of recession . This was too much for the Wall Street Journal . and it took a whole editorial to say so . During the lengthy White House conferences on how to meet the Berlin crisis , Dillon at one time favored raising taxes to cover part of the increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Samuelson , argued against it , and in the end Dillon came around to their view . Thus , Dillon may be distinguished from his more liberal colleagues only in degree , not in kind . He took an active hand in the Administration effort to push down home-mortgage rates , and he has supported all of Kennedy 's legislative proposals . True , he has been more optimistic than others about recovery . But so has the Secretary of Commerce , Luther Hodges . Dillon has opposed a tax cut as a counter-cyclical device and wondered whether Congress would accept some of the more ambitious spending programs . But so have Ted Sorensen and Kennedy 's Congressional leaders . The Dillon influence at the White House has grown steadily . There is a close relationship between the President and the Cabinet officer , two men of enormous personal wealth . That Dillon was able to switch loyalties from Eisenhower to Kennedy so readily says something for his flexibility . It also supplies a basic clue to Kennedy 's closely held views . " Mr. Dillon would not have accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in general agreement , with me , " Kennedy said in Palm Beach , " and I would not have asked him to accept the position if I had not been in general agreement with him . " Dillon put it much the same way to me during a conversation in his office : " When you talk about fiscal soundness , " he said . " I do n't think there 's much difference between this Administration and the last one . Certainly there 's not as much difference between the two of them as each makes out . " Some weeks ago , Dillon casually announced that he was setting up a consulting board of thirty economists and professors to meet periodically with high Treasury officials . In charge of the group ? and responsible for picking them ? is Dr. Seymour Harris of Harvard , an outstanding liberal economist . This threatens an overlap with the Council of Economic Advisers , and Heller is ever so slightly miffed . But Dillonwants access to " new ideas " to help solve the problems confronting the Treasury , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems , to expose himself to the workings of the academic mind , as well as to the clink-clink of the banking fraternity 's brains . The liberal persuasion of the Harris group is also a badge that Dillon can display to doubting Democrats on Capitol Hill . It 's all quite a change from the days when Treasury Secretary George Humphrey , strong man of the first Eisenhower Cabinet , told a visitor that Arthur F. Burns , then Eisenhower 's chief economist , " had never met a payroll . " Of course , Treasury Secretaries before Dillon have had outside economic consultants . But when IIarris and his confreres trooped into the Treasury for a two-day meeting , Dillon did not make a pro-forma appearance , then disappear . He stayed for hours on end , soaking up information , cross-examining even for minutiae . DILUTED IDEALISM I T WILL not take very long to find out whether Mr. Kennedy was wise in following the Dillon rather than the Heller lead or whether ? as the joint Committee and others have warned ? he should have called for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members have told the President that in order to get full recovery ? which they define as unemployment reduced to 4 per cent ? we will have to spend more money , run a bigger deficit , keep interest rates low , and cut taxes . One reason he his rejected this advice is his fear of a big deficit . But another influence has also made itself felt ? that of William McChesney Martin . The Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board insists that interest rates can be pushed just so far , and that the level of spending needed to cut deep into unemployment will bring on a riotous inflation . The Federal Reserve System has a mystique all its own . From its marble headquarters on Constitution Avenue it conveys a sense of knowing all , and Martin himself has long been a revered symbol of integrity as unassailable as the gold standard or J. Edgar Hoover . Views from such an authority are not lightly brushed aside and Kennedy has weighed them seriously in planning his fiscal policy for the coming year . Indeed , he vetoed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacancy , instead named another Democrat ? George Mitchell of Chicago ? who would be considered by Martin to be less doctrinaire . What , then , is the prospect ? The Council , in my view , reached a high point of service and influence when it convinced the President that raising taxes , as part of the Berlin crisis program , would be bad economics ; it would slow down growth and recovery . But Mr. Kennedy promised , at the same time , that next year 's budget would be " strictly in balance . " This will be satisfactory only if unemployment has been cut sharply , and if the balance is not achieved by eliminating key social programs . The aid-toeducation program , for example , is already considered the first casualty of the preparedness build-up . And surely this nation ought not have a balanced budget at the expense of heavy unemployment . It is argued in some quarters that we will simply have to get used to larger numbers of unemployed . This is a defeatist point of view . It is dangerous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economists used to talk of 3 per cent unemployed as the tolerable , expectable rate in a " fully " employed society , but the figure has now been moved up to 4 per cent . ) As Kennedy said in his message to Congress last May : " Large-scale unemployment during a recession is bad enough . Large-scale unemployment during recovery is intolerable to a free economy . It is a major social evil . It is a source of national weakness . " There is always the chance , of course , that Heller and the expansionists have painted too bleak a picture . Arthur Burns believes they have and predicts a rapid recovery to full employment soon after mid-1962 . But even if true , this would not mean that the nation could stopstriving for better education , housing , health , and all else Heller defines as " social " capital . The next " round " for critical decisions in this area will come toward the end of this year , as Kennedy develops his first full Budget and Economic Messages . If there is little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are shunted aside , liberal Democrats , educators , and others who believe in an expanded economy will have to start fighting in earnest . It 's time now , however , for economists to give economic advice , unmoderated by calculated political considerations . The political strategy can be left to the politicians ? there are plenty of good ones in Washington . In the first year of this Administration too much obeisance has been paid to political feasibility , If economists do not argue cogently and forcefully for their programs , the goals they want to achieve may never become politically feasible . As for Mr. Kennedy himself , he has shown that he has a conservative streak and is more " deficit conscious " than was thought before . But he is not an intractable person . ( One of his closest aides says : Jack rarely buys an idea the first time around . " And Kennedy himself noted at a press conference that , as a Senator in 1958 , he voted against a tax cut when it was brought up as an anti-recession measure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) His liberal advisers hope that he will want a place in the history books more significant than being a better budget balancer than Eisenhower . If so , he would do well to recall the inspiring words of his Inaugural Address . At least , " Let us begin . "
