If all economists were laid end to end , they still would not reach a conclusion . <P> - George Bernard Shaw <P> In a speech to the Advertising Council last week in Washington , President Kennedy declared that he was " more than ever convinced " of the truth of Shaw 's waspish comment . He noted that by U.S. Industry quarterly with economists today " every problem has several alternative solutions , and every answer raises several questions . " But the President had no doubt about his own solution for what ails the U.S. economy ; he again asked support for raising the national debt limit , cutting taxes , and running the budget at a deficit . If these measures are blocked , said Kennedy , the result would be a " downturn for the American economy as a whole . " The New York Times editorialized that this " amounts to buck-passing in advance , aimed at pinning the blame on Congress for any possible recession . " <P> Drawing on history to drive home his point , Kennedy blamed " a Republican President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recession by deciding " to keep the debt limit unrealistically low , to cut back and stretch out budget expenditures , to tighten monetary policy , and reject all efforts at tax reduction . " The results : unemployment went from 4% to 6% , the growth rate of gross national product slipped from 4% a year to 3% , and business spending on new plants and equipment fell in 1962 to a lower level than in 1957 . <P> Running for Cover . But while Kennedy was warning of recession , economists were scanning one of the most eagerly awaited statistics of the year , and from it finding themselves in more agreement than Shaw thought them capable of . The statistic was the Commerce Department 's survey of what U.S. business plans to spend on plant and equipment in 1963 , which economists regard as a key to economic activity for the rest of the year . Capital spending , said the department , will hit a record $39.1 billion , up 5% from last year . Best of all , the bellwether durable-goods industry intends to spend $7.7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these encouraging figures , many economists concluded that the prospects of a recession this year have just about vanished . Said one senior Government economist : " The results of this survey should send the pessimists running for cover . " On the other hand , no one thought that the new figures were good enough to spell a real economic upsurge , and that view was supported by the Federal Reserve Board 's report that industrial production remained unchanged in February . Capital spending still amounts to only 6.8% of this year 's projected $578 billion gross national product v. 1957 's 8.3% . To bring on boom times , economists agree , capital spending should rise 13% to 15% over last year . <P> Rueful Note . The new spending figures only increased the President 's worry that his programs will have a hard time in Congress . Departing from his text , Kennedy ruefully noted that Presidents always get blamed for recessions-even when they try to prevent them . Said he : " When things go bad , the chicken comes to roost on the President 's house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards , is at least a demonstrable truth .
