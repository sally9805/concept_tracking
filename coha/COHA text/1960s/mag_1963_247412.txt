The Steppe , when Anton Chekhov wrote about it in a tale as monotonous and mesmeric as the steppe itself , was in Russia . But times have changed . In this movie directed by Alberto Lattuada ( Tempest ) , the steppe is in Yugoslavia and all its inhabitants speak Italian . Khrushchev &; Co. may consider this a steppe in the wrong direction . But the literary crowd will applaud Lattuada 's loyalty to Chekhov 's plot ; children who are old enough to read the subtitles will take the hero to their hearts ; and Walt Disney will no doubt hate himself for not making the picture first . <P> The hero is a nine-year-old boy ( Daniel Spallone ) named Egorooshka who leaves home in the country and goes to school in the city . To get there , he makes a journey across the steppe and on the way accomplishes a lively passage from innocence to experience . First day out , the boy gapes in innocent wonder at every passing beetle , but life soon confronts him with a pack of savage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a wild young man who grabs him and hurls him into a deep river just for the hell of it . <P> Forced every day to face some kind of danger , the child swiftly loses his fear of it . One night , when two peasants put their quarrel to the knife , he rushes boldly between them and breaks up the fight . A day or two later , delirious with chills and fever , he stands up like a man to the terrors of the mind . Next morning he is well . Life , he discovers , is like the steppe . Every day is a journey , and the end of one journey is the beginning of the next . The big thing is to keep going .
