txt A high White House source said today that the budget President Johnson will send to Congress this month will be " in the neighborhood of $100 billion . " That figure , if accurate , would indicate that Mr. Johnson and his department heads had produced a budget $2 billion to $3 billion below the estimates they were making a few weeks ago . It also was announced here that the Administration would send to Congress next year a " large and significant " housing program , including new public housing units and new programs to assist private developers . Robert C. Weaver , the Administrator of the Housing and Home Finance Agency , described the program after conferring at the LEJ ranch with President Johnson . Mr. Weaver would not estimate the cost of what he said would be a five-point housing program . He refused also to specify the number of new public housing units to be requested . Mr. Johnson also conferred today with Postmaster General John A. Gronouski , Mr. Gronouski announced later that despite Associated Press Wtrephoto Robert C. Weaver speaks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service he would reduce Post , Office Department personnel by 5,000 and cut back the department 's modernization program by nearly 75 per cent . Spending totals in the current budget are expected to be about $98.8 billion when the fiscal year ends on June 30 . Thus , a $100 billion budget would represent an increase of just over $1 billion dollars . When Mr. Johnson began working on the budget , White House and other Administration officials predicted several times that it would have to total between $102 and $104 billion . So did Mr. Johnson himself , at a news conference . This would be caused by builtin increases , called for by previous legislation , totaling about $3.5 billion , they said . Those increases alone would push the new budget total above $102 billion , it was pointed out . The source who predicted a $100 billion budget today said a " substantial amount of cutting " had been done since the early estimates were published . Cuts Not Specified The source did not specify where the cuts had been made , , or discuss why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described earlier as virtually impossible to achieve . Mr. Gronouski said the postal deficit in the new budget would be reduced by $100 million from the $650 million expected this year . But he indicated the $100 million reduction was largely ' dependent on the willingness of the Interstate Commerce Commission to grant a $77 million increase in parcel post rates . The Postmaster General said that postal volume in the year ending June 30 , 1965 , would be increased by about 2 billion pieces of mail over , the 70.2 billion to be handled this year . Service will have to be provided for more than a million more families , he added . Even so , Mr. Gronouski insisted , postal service would not be impaired by reducing postal employment by 5,000 persons and cutting the proposed outlay for extending and modernizing postal facilities from $43 million this year to $10 million next year . " Essential postal services " will be maintained , he said , by increased use of mechanical equipment and the spread of the zip code system  --  the method of indicating addresses by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget would be larger or smaller than that for fiscal 1964 . He said only that Mr. Johnson and budget officials had reduced his department 's request for fiscal 1965 by about $200 million . The reduction of 5,000 in postal personnel , if achieved , would cut the department 's employment totals to 590,000 . Mr. Weaver outlined in general terms the following housing program : C:A public housing section that would authorize construction of an unspecified but " significant " ' number of new units and also ' provide for the purchase and leasing of existing private dwelling units for use as public housing . flAdditional assistance of an unspecified new type for relocating low-income families and small businesses uprooted by urban renewal , and a program of special assistance to ( housing owners forced by urban renewal or city codes to rehabilitate their property . ' IGrants to the states to provide on-the-job training a as well as school and college education for needed personnel in the housing field  --  city planners , for instance , and public administrators . gAssisting , in part through ) favorable credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly in providing water and sewer facilities at the time the houses are built . 41A similar program for largescale housing developments , running into thousands of units , with both commercial and public facilities included . Other Parts of Plan Mr. Weaver said the housing bill would also include extension of what he called the successful program of aiding moderateincome families to build or buy houses . Finally , he said , it would in-clude assistance for urban mass transist systems  --  a program already passed in the Senate . He refused to say how much the program or any of its parts would cost but he called the section affecting huge housing developments " one of the most significant things we have ever done in the field of land policy . " Mr. Weaver said he had told President Johnson that new housing starts would exceed 1,500,000 for 1963 , when final figures become available . That was the second highest total in history , he said , with only the 1,650,000 new starts of 1955 exceeding it . Late in the day , Mr. Johnson left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where there is a sizable lake . The President maintains a motorboat there and took it for , a cruise .
