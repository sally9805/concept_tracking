Market optimists who have been awaiting the " traditional " summer rise took it on the chin last week . For the second week in a row , each day the market closed lower than the day before , at Friday 's closing was down 20.37 on the Dow-Jones industrial average to 609.87-the biggest weekly drop since March , and only eleven points above the year 's low . The New York Times combined average of 501 stocks hit its worst point since November 1958 . But there was no rush to sell . Volume averaged a thin 2,500,000 shares daily as the market drifted down . " People are uncertain , " as Walston &; Co. ' s Edmund W. Tabbell put it . " They 're not scared enough to sell , but not certain enough to buy . " Perhaps some of the uncertainty was caused by the rumblings from Khrushchev , the Congo and U.S. politicking . But the biggest worry was over the question of when business would show more of an upsurge . <P> Despite a lot of talk about disappointing second-quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other reasons . The stocks of Budd , Goodrich . Liggett &; Myers and American Steel Foundries , for example , all rose despite lower earnings reports . A.M.F. , Burroughs , Crown Zellerbach , General Foods and Gillette all fell despite the fact they had higher earnings . <P> Stop Loss . A phenomenon of the market in recent weeks has been a flurry of sudden , sharp drops in such old favorites as Brunswick , Universal Match and Thiokol . Many brokers blamed such flurries on the thinness of the markets : a comparatively small number of shares , bought or sold , cause a big change in price . To make markets broader , the New York Stock Exchange argues that margins , which now require a buyer to put up 90% of the price , should be reduced , since there is far less credit buying in the market than in any other segment of the economy . But the Federal Reserve Board has shown no signs of giving in . <P> Other brokers laid the blame for the sudden jumps and dips at the dancing feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Julia ( TIME , May 15 , 1959 ) . His book , How I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock Market , published five weeks ago , has already sold more than 100,000 copies . A key part of Darvas ' system is the use of the " stop-loss order " ; e.g. , an investor with a stock selling at 40 instructs his broker to sell if the price dips below 38 to limit his loss . The catch is that if the only bid at the moment happens to be several points lower , the broker is required to sell . Thus , the seller who hoped to limit his loss to fractions of a point often takes a far bigger loss . When investors who have been waiting to buy at , say , 35 , see the drop and rush to buy , the stock shoots back up again . <P> The Thirteen . Stop-loss orders have increased 25% in the past five weeks , Specialist John Coleman estimates , and have nearly doubled in some of the glamour stocks . The result : whenever the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain , and the stock plummets . Standard Kollsman stock was caught this way recently : the exchange canceled all Kollsman stop-loss orders on the books , has yet to restore them .
