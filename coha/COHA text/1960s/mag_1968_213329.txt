1897 SEARS ROEBUCK CATALOGUE ; introductions by S. J. Perelman and Richard Rovere. 786 pages . Chelsea House . $14.95 . <P> Any archaeologist knows that nothing gives a better picture of how vanished civilizations lived , loved and fought than the utensils , ornaments and weapons that were left behind in successive layers of kitchen midden . For this reason alone , this hardback facsimile of an 1897 Sears Roebuck catalogue is a dazzling trove for students of Americana . It certainly is one of the happiest publishing ideas in years . <P> Back in the days when two stuffed turtledoves under glass decorated many a tasteful parlor , whole families sat for hours poring over the treasures in a Sears catalogue . It was called " the wishing book , " and it was usually tattered and dog-eared by the time somebody punched a hole in it and hung it in the family privy . When this particular catalogue appeared , the firm of Sears Roebuck and Co. - founded by Richard W. Sears , a former railroad-station agent , and Alvah Roebuck , a watch repairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Legend has it that Sears wrote every single word of the copy that described the dizzying array of 6,000 articles listed in the book . Alternating between soft sell and hard , occasionally combining both , his exhortatory prose provides an intriguing contrast with today 's merchandising methods . S. J. Perelman , in his introductory essay , even professes to see a touch of malevolence in Sears ' flat statement : " Our boot and shoe department is admirable . If we ca n't suit you in quality and price , there is no use in looking further . " <P> Still , whether offering hall trees ( " Money wo n't buy more stylish goods " ) or watches ( " Almost given away " ) , Sears appealed to a buying public that was then largely rural and firmly bound by the Puritan ethic : waste was sinful , and so were fripperies . But it was also an epoch when ordinary folks were beginning to yearn for " nice things " and even a few luxuries-if they were cheap enough and guaranteed to be durable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in men 's toupees and nerve pills , mowing machines and dog-powered churns , foot scrapers and kraut cutters . Sears sewing machines and wagons , forges or stoves , were guaranteed to give the purchaser status ( " The neighbors would admire it once they were permitted to inspect it " ) . <P> The Sears catalogue lists a variety of capsules , tinctures , pills and boluses calculated to cure almost any known ailment , physical or mental . There were worm cakes and a highly touted microbe killer ( " Will prevent LaGrippe , Catarrh , Consumption , Malaria , Blood Poison , Rheumatism and all disorders of the blood " ) . There was also an elixir " guaranteed to destroy all desire for liquor " and a magical tonic called " Peruvian wine of cocoa " that was recommended " if you wish to accomplish double the amount of work or have to undergo an unusual amount of hardship . " Arsenic wafers were offered to tone up the complexion , and an " electric ring for rheumatism " ( 85 ; goldplated , $1.25 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
