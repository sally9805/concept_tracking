LAMENT FOR THE MOLLY MAGUIRES by Arthur H. Lewis . 308 pages . Harcourt , Brace &; World . $5.75 . <P> <P> A century ago , terror stalked the coal fields of eastern Pennsylvania . Men were gunned down on the open road and even in their own parlors . Informers had their ears cut off and their tongues torn out by the roots . Dynamite destroyed mine tipples and derailed freight trains . In one coal-mining county alone , there were 142 unsolved murders in 13 years . <P> This savage undeclared war was fought for nearly three decades , between unequal antagonists . On one side were a few thousand Irish immigrants who lived in shantytowns beside the collieries and worked in the mines for wages as low as 50 a day . On the other were the absentee mine owners in Manhattan and London , who fought the battle through their mine superintendents-usually of English or Welsh origin-and their own private army , the Coal and Iron Police . <P> The fighting arm of the immigrant Irish miners was known as the Molly Maguires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British during Ireland 's great famine . In the U.S. , the Mollies concealed themselves within the Ancient Order of Hibernians , a legitimate benevolent association of Irish-Americans . They were led by Jack Kehoe , a tall , tough ex-miner turned saloonkeeper ; each branch of the society was headed by a " body-master , " who could produce a dozen gunmen when needed . <P> Agent Provocateur . The man who broke the Molly Maguires was Franklin Benjamin Gowen , president of the Philadelphia &; Reading Coal &; Iron Co. , whose ancestors had come from Ireland 's Protestant north ; and he used another Irishman to penetrate the Mollies . His choice for the job was James McParlan , a gifted , gabby little Pinkerton detective who was as ready with his fists as with his wits . <P> Violence in the coal fields was actually diminishing at the time when Pinkerton Agent McParlan , posing as a murderer on the run from Buffalo police , wormed his way into the high councils of the Molly Maguires . It was later charged that McParlan acted as an agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed character : from reprisals against brutal or dishonest mine bosses , the Mollies turned to capricious , Mafialike assaults on anyone who offended one of their band . <P> Docile Wave . When McParlan threw off his disguise in 1876 , after three years as a Molly Maguire , he had enough evidence to send 20 men to the gallows . By this time , the Mollies were in a bad way , denounced by their Roman Catholic priests , shunned by decent citizens , swamped in a new wave of supposedly more docile immigrants from eastern Europe . The trials were swift and of doubtful legality . No Roman Catholic was allowed on a jury , and the prosecution was headed by Mine Owner Franklin Gowen himself . Several of the condemned men were almost certainly innocent ; one was hanged while the courier bearing a reprieve from the Governor hammered on the prison door .
