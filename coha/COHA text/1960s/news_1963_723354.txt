However , he surrendered voluntarily at the District Attorney 's ' office in the Bronx County Courthouse , accompanied by a new lawyer , Philip R. Edelbaum . It was learned that Samuel Segal , who had previously represented Mr. Martinis , had intended to ' withdraw from the case in the event of an indictment . The lawyer of record now is Maurice Edelbaum , who is on vacation . Philip is his son .

He obtained six indictments , in which four defendants pleaded guilty . One case Was dismissed and another is pending . " I think the chances of conviction in the Martinis case are very good , " Mr. Dollinger said . The accident occurred in Riverdale in the Bronx at about 7:30 P.M. on a Sunday . Mr. Martinis was driving north , he said , when he cut out of the inside lane to pass another car . Witnesses have testified that he struck the right rear fender of a car , also going north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Brunk car swung into the southbound lane and collided with the car of Eugene Kramon , 49 , a clothing manufacturer . Mystery Plate Found All five persons in the Brunk car were killed : the driver , his wife , their 6-year-old grandson and two friends . Mr. Kramon was seriously injured .

" The District Attorney said that Mr. Martinis was not being prosecuted on the same charges as those on which he was acquitted . Prosecution of a defendant for the second time on charges of which he has been acquitted places him in double jeopardy , which is outlawed . Some lawyers , on the other hand , have expressed doubt whether a charge of vehicular homicide could be made to stand up once a driver has been cleared of charges of reckless and drunken driving . The implication that Mr. Martinis was set free because he was a judge 's son has produced retorts by the defense that the , reverse may now be true . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think this defendant , because he is a judge 's son , should be treated any differently , especially harshly . " Bar Groups Investigate Two bar groups began investigations after the first Martinis trial . One , which is not completed , is being conducted by the criminal courts committee ) f the Association of the Bar of the City of New York . The other , by the Bronx County Criminal Courts Bar Association , has been concluded . The association said that despite " glaring contradictions " in testimony , Mr. Martinis 's acquittal had been consistent with the evidence . Any suggestion of " impropriety " on the part of the three judges was rejected . Meanwhile , a hearing was held last month by the State Department of Motor Vehicles on Mr. Martinis 's driving license . It was revoked . In this four-and-a-half-hour , quasi-judicial session in the State Office Building here witnesses told of seeing the Martinis car weaving along the parkway at speeds estimated as high as 90 miles an hour . Others recounted how he had had " three or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene of the accident . Again police witnesses were unable to agree on the issue of drunkenness . The Police Department opened its own investigation in an effort to resolve these discrepan cies . Mr. Martinis now has had his license revoked three times : first , for a number of moving violations ( speeding ) ; second , for filing false statements in an application , and third , for the recent accident . The police found five unanswered traffic tickets in his car . These were all for a defective muffler , for which he paid S85 in fines.
