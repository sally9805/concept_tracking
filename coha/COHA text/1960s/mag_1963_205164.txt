In at least one way , John F. Kennedy had the country moving again . And the result was sore feet . <P> The President had offered his challenge to the Marine Corps : match the Marines of 1908 by marching 50 miles in 20 hours , according to the terms of an old Teddy Roosevelt order . The Marines responded . And so , it seemed , did everyone else who could muster up the same kind of spirit it took to swallow gold fish , raid for panties or whirl a hula hoop . <P> Just to Loosen Up . At Camp Lejeune , N.C. , the 34 marines designated officially by Commandant David Shoup to uphold the honor of the corps , took the 50 miles in stride . Led by Brigadier General Rathvon McClure Tompkins , 50 , who still limps from an old shrapnel wound , all finished within the time limit , carrying 24-lb. combat packs . Tompkins finished ninth . Bachelor Lieut . Donald Bernath trotted in first-in 11 hr. 44 min. - just in time to keep a date with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contingent of marines managed to finish 53 miles , took exactly 20 hours to do it . <P> Predictably it was Bobby Kennedy , the Administration 's touch-football quarterback , who took the field in defense of the New Frontier 's own honor . Rousting four Justice Department aides out of bed to accompany him , the Attorney General and three dogs set out at 5 a.m. along the towpath of the old Chesapeake and Ohio Canal . Where the path was not slick with ice , it was gooey with mud , but Bobby 's scuffed Cordovan oxfords never faltered . <P> On he walked toward Harpers Ferry . Come on , beckoned Bobby , let 's run a bit ' ' just to loosen up . " By the 35-mile mark , all four aides had dropped out . but Bobby completed the 50 miles alone in a respectable 17 hr. 50 min . And next morning he rose at 7:30 , made it to 9 o'clock mass and then went ice skating with his children . <P> Like Stuffing a Booth . Across the country , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though their adult leaders seldom kept up . College fraternities took to it with the same gusto with which they once stuffed telephone booths . In California 400 Marin County high school students set out , and 97 finished-including 16-year-old Diana Congdon , who covets a place among lady discus throwers in the 1964 Olympics and who walked the 50 miles in 13 hr. 29 min. , toting an 8-lb. knapsack filled with a diminishing supply of candy , oranges and fresh clothes . In Burlington , N.C. , a 58-year-old postman ( who rides a motor scooter on his route ) walked the 50 miles in 10 hr. 28 min .. boasted he could cut two hours off that time . Newspapers scrambling for a " bright feature " put their most athletic reporters on the road , though few finished 50 miles . One-the San Francisco Chronicle 's Bob Robertson-managed 50 miles around the city 's famed Scenic Drive , which the Chronicle thought should be renamed " Robertson 's Track . " <P> Plucky , Not Stupid . But not everyone was ready to tumble from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio announcer shunned the forced marches , made plans instead for a " restathon , " vowing he would attempt 20 nonstop hours in the sack . Even psychiatrists got into the act . In San Francisco one shrugged that the hikers were merely seeking " ego boosters . " " The one who does it can look down contemptuously on the one who ca n't , " said he , looking down even more contemptuously.
