txt What 's ahead .. . It started as an all-night bull session among six college men in Atlanta . Now it has escalated into a full-blown patriotic rally at the ball park . Just before Christmas six Emory University students sat up until dawn discussing what they could do to affirm their backing for American policy in Vietnam . Washington officials and UN diplomats got involved . And the students soon raised $50,000 toward " Affirmation : Vietnam . " This giant mass meeting is expected to draw between 25,000 to 30,000 Atlantans to the city 's new municipal stadium on Feb. 12 . Secretary of State Dean Rusk will fly in to explain why American troops are fighting in Vietnam . Georgia 's two United States senators will be there and so will some of the state 's con- gressmen . Ambassadors from five Far Eastern nations will come and a stage full of Hollywood talent will entertain . International press and TV coverage has been arranged . From tiny bull sessions mighty rallies sometimes grow . Another spectacular American cavern hewn out by nature is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blanchard Springs Cavern  --  lies in the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas , 150 miles north of Little Rock . When it opens for full tourist traffic it will rank in grandeur with Carlsbad Cavern in New Mexico and Mammoth Cave in Kentucky . It wo n't be as large as either . But spelunkers say its formations are unmatched . Among them is a flowstone 150 feet long and 30 feet high and walls girt with crystals up to 4 inches long . The cavern was largely a legend until the early 1950 's . Then spelunkers began returning with tales of spectacular formations . This quickened the interest of the United States Forest Service . Already $300,000 has been spent to turn the caverns into a national tourist attraction . President Johnson has just asked for another 8550,000 . It may cost up to $2 million before its catwalks and tunnels are ready for full-scale traffic . That will be in April , 1968 . But some rooms will be open before then . For the first time in modern Texas political history an official " team " is running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved . The team , Democrats Stanley C. Woods , a natural-gas producer , and State Rep. Bill Hollowell , intend to run in the primary May 7 against Gov . John Connally and Lt. Gov . Preston Smith . They do n't stand much chance . Texas , in fact , seems unmoved about the whole primary . Poll-tax payments point to a low turnout ? probably lower than 1964 and possibly below 1962 . The only real stir on the ballot is the three-way race for attorney general . Most other Democratic incumbents are running unopposed . Trends .. ? Atlanta is becoming more and more " the New York of the South . " It is mushrooming as Dixie 's financial center . Some 400 of the nation 's 500 biggest industrial corporations now have offices in Atlanta . Thirty-eight of the country 's 50 largest transportation firms , 22 of its 50 biggest merchandising concerns , 47 of the 50 largest life insurance companies , 4 of the 50 major utilities , and one of the top 50 banks are sited there . The city now ranks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholesale sales . Some 70 new office buildings , 84 new manufacturing plants , and 116 warehouses , are all abuilding in Atlanta . How and why .. . South Carolina is suddenly growing cotton to match its spindles . It has long led the nation in spindles ? more active ones than any other state . But until two years ago Carolina cotton yields averaged less than a bale an acre . Now that has shot up . The lint produced per acre has quadrupled in the last few years . One farmer in 1965 produced an astonishing yield-5.3 bales per acre on five allotted acres of skip-row cotton . And he did it on land where such yields never before seemed possible . Many Carolina farmers have learned the trick of matching the ravages of weather and insects with methods and materials that nullify their damaging effects . This has involved extra care from the preparation of the soil to the picking of the crop . Much cotton grown in South Carolina at one time was often unfit to use in the state 's textile mills .
