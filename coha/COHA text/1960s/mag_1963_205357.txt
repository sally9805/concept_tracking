Designing is such a prestigious profession these days that there seems to be more of it than there are things to design . The result is overdesign , bringing more that is really less , heralding improvements that do not improve . Recent examples : <P> BUMPERS . Once there were bumpers to guard the fenders ; now the bumpers seem far too delicate to be bumped . Some , in fact , have so many knife-edges and knobs that they act more like can openers than bumpers . As for the friendly push in time of stress , drivers have to be careful that pusher and pushee match up bumper-wise . One solution ( by Dodge ) : bumper guards to guard the bumpers-and the bumpee . <P> DISPOSALS . Though they were meant to provide an easy system for getting rid of garbage , most disposals are such picky eaters that an accompanying list spells out what must be otherwise disposed of . " There you are , " says ARCHITECTURAL FORUM Managing Editor Peter Blake , " with a paper bag full of disgusting garbage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get out metals , bottles , plastics , et al . " <P> FAUCETS . With rare exceptions , bathroom faucets all used to turn one way-counterclockwise for on , clockwise off-something a man with soap in his eyes could rely on as he groped for the hot water faucet in the shower . Then the designers got the modern impulse to get symmetrical , and devised matching handles that turned in opposite directions , toward or away from each other . No one knows which way is which until he tries it . <P> <P> Sometimes in the same bathroom the hot turns on in one direction on one fixture , in the opposite direction on another . <P> FOAM-RUBBER CUSHIONS . Neither soft nor comfortable , the new cushions spring disconcertingly back into their original inhospitable form , seem visually as uninviting as a concrete slab with the **26;13443;TOOLONG appearance of an ad in a homemakers ' magazine . <P> VENETIAN BLINDS . A centuries-old and efficient design , the Venetian blind has been tampered with by improvers , who have divided it so that top and bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the adjusting cord run through a snap spring . Result : they jam . <P> Many of the better designers view the trend with distaste . Concludes Designer Charles Eames : " There is a danger when the better mousetrap is better at catching people than at catching mice . And that 's the trap we are finding ourselves in right now .
