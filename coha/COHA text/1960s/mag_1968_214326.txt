Not since Cortes gave Guatemozin a hotfoot in an effort to make him reveal where the Aztecs kept their gold has Mexico been invaded by such a determined band of treasure hunters as the U.S. Olympic team . " The greatest competitive Olympics in history , " as U.S. Track Coach Payton Jordan called them , proved to be a showcase for the multifarious talents of an inspired U.S. squad bent on cornering all the gold in Mexico City-and the silver and bronze as well . The medal score told the story : by week 's end , with only a handful of events still to go , the U.S. had collected 42 gold , 26 silver and 30 bronze for a total of 98 medals , compared with Runner-up Russia 's 65 , only 21 of which were gold . <P> The Americans dominated track and field , winning 15 events , as 15 world records were broken and two others tied . Curiously , the stiffest competition came not from the Russians , who proved unaccountably weak , but from three African nations-Kenya , Ethiopia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meters to the traditional 26-mile 385-yd . Greek marathon . Kansas ' Jim Ryun , the 1,500-meter world record holder , could only moan , " My God , how it hurts , " after losing to Kipchoge Keino , who ran it in 3 min. 34.9 sec. - second fastest time ever recorded for the metric mile . The thin air may have been a boon to Oregon 's Dick Fosbury , whose unorthodox , over-the-bar-backwards , high-jumping style propelled him to an Olympic record height of 7 ft. 41 in . It certainly did nothing to slow down Bill Toomey , whose speed afoot was the major factor in his decathlon victory . <P> Money in the Shoes ? No Olympics would be complete without a scandal , and this time the rhubarb involved alleged under-the-table payments to U.S. and foreign athletes by rival German track-shoe manufacturers . Rumor piled on rumor : stories told of payoffs ranging as high as $6,500 ; officials were said to have canceled checks to prove that bribes were paid ; several U.S. medal-winners were reported guilty . But rumors the stories remained after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find " nothing to substantiate " them . <P> Apart from the payola controversy , the big news of the week was the almost monotonous parade of Americans to the victory pedestal . There were elev en boxing weight classes in Mexico City , and U.S. boxers won medals in seven of them . In yachting . New Orleans ' Buddy Friedrichs and San Diego 's Lowell North won gold medals . In shooting , Nebraska 's Gary Anderson , a 29-year-old Army lieutenant , scored 1,157 out of a possible 1,200 points to win the free-rifle competition and break his own world record . Competing in his fourth Olympics , Connecticut 's Bill Steinkraus , a 43-year-old book editor , earned the U.S. its first equestrian gold medal in 20 years when he piloted a borrowed , gimpy-legged , nine-year-old gelding named Snowbound to victory in the Grand Prix jumping event .
