About $20 , - 000,000 of that is scheduled to come from increases in the state aid formula . Wait Is Confirmed The remainder was to have . been provided by the telephone tax . The Governor confirmed today that any financial aid for schools to come from forming new federated districts and giving them nonproperty taxing power could not be available , as a practical matter , before the 1961-62 school year . If the Federal Government refuses to relinquish the telephone tax , Mr. Rockefeller said , he will have to find " some other method " of getting $70,000,000 for local school districts . He would not say what that method might be . When asked if an emergency one-year grant of state aid was under consideration , he replied : " I do n't think that would be necessary . " The Governer also affirmed that he did not foresee any leaders in New York City that to return the state to a pay-as-you-go fiscal basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Rockefeller has pledged himself to balance the state budget this year with current revenue , without any depletion of reserves or reliance on borrowing .

" The Governor said he would not recommend enacting a local telephone tax on the top of the Federal one , if the latter were retained . He indicated it would be impractical to enact a standby local telephone tax in New York to take effect only if Congress allowed the Federal version to expire . Mr. Rockefeller said he was willing to accept state responsibility for programs now financed by the Federal Government in vocational rehabilitation and water pollution . When President Eisenhower suggested at the last session of Congress the possibility of giving the states the telephone tax , he coupled it with a recommendation that the states take over these Federal activities . The Governor will be in the White House next Monday to discuss civil defense problems wih @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even likely " that the telephone tax would come up in their conversations . As for the possibility that other states might join with New York in opposing President Eisenhower 's reluctance to abandon the tax , Mr. Rockefeller observed : " This is a problem  --  let 's face it ? all over the country . A constructive solution , like the one offered by the telephone tax , is attractive . It 's natural that a lot of states would be support . ing it . "
