txt WASHINGTON , Oct. 6 ? " New ideas " to . deal . with the great and growing problems . of these times have been conspicuous by their absence - from the 1960 Presidential campaign . Though both candidates and both platforms claim to have produced - them , most of their proposais have been rewritings of old ones , or what - may be new in them has . ' been muffled in.generalities . But there is no lack of new ideas from.qualified authorities in this country who are not engaged in professional politics . Recently the gist of a fresh proposal to cope with the basic problem of the farm surplus was given in this space . The idea is new in these fundamental aspects : a surplus would be conceived , not as inevitably a burden , but as the boon it would be considered by most other nations ; a year 's stockpile of food against emergencies would be withdrawn for storage in expanded Government facilities ; and the remainder would be offered to needy countries in exchange for their own currencies . Clayton 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who served the Federal Government with great distinction in high offices concerned with the international economy , has come another new and bold idea ? " an economic federation of the free world " as the strongest force to dispel the threat of international communism . " Under a free world common market , " he submits , " the standard of living through the world would rise , sound industrialization of the poorer countries would occur , the economic gap between them and the richer would be progressively narrowed , and the whole world would become a more healthful and peaceful place in which to live . " The Los Angeles and Chicago platforms proclaim their support of this objective . But Clayton offers specifications to give meanings to these proclamations , and that is the big difference . He points out that " the technological revolution bursting out all over the world has brought countries so close together that there are few if any domestic policies which do not impinge on foreign policy . " Therefore , the former Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs wants the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States between foreign and domestic , policy and resolve it in . such a way that the strength of the former will not be impaired . " In brief summary his solution is this : One Free Trade Area The twenty nations of the Organization for European Economic Cooperation are now divided into the Inner Six and the Outer Seven , with five still on their own . Under United States leadership , and with Canada added , this could become one free trade area . It would be occupied by nearly half a billion of the most highly industrialized people in the world . Conceding the views of many business men that United States industry still needs tariff , quota and other protections , also that this country has special economic responsibilities toward Latin America and Japan , Clayton finds support for his idea in an experience of the European Common Market . Though only small tariff cuts and quota increases became effective in 1959 French exports to other members rose by 33 per cent , Italian by 27 per cent and German by 12 per cent . Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent the success of the plan are now applying most of the pressure for speeding up the transition . Intertwined Policies Clayton cites the United States farm program as an example of the inseparability of domestic from foreign policy on which his plan is founded . Food-and-fiber importing nations , he comments , " see the richest country in the world fixing prices above the world market , using its wealth to create artificial scarcities , diverting food and fiber from the channels of trade into Government warehouses , paying farmers not to produce and in the past paying , them to destroy what they had produced . " And , he asks , " How would we feel toward a nation that hoarded a billion bushels of wheat if our children went hungry to bed ? " True , adds Clayton , " Now and then we give some millions of bushels to the needy , but people want to earn their way by trade , not aid . " There is no lack of " new ideas , " only of those in office who will weigh them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
