In normally Republican Ohio , some abnormal things are happening . When physicians drove up to a meeting of the Butler County Medical Society , an astonishing number of their cars bore L.B.J. bumper stickers . Yet , at the same time many of those same cars carried a second sticker with another name on it : TAFT . <P> Embraceable ? The extent of the Republican defection to Johnson in Ohio - in one county , a Republican official estimates it at 20%-is surprising . But the fact that many of these same people plan to split their ballots and vote for Republican Robert Taft Jr . for the U.S. Senate is not . The Taft name obviously packs a potent political punch in the state that sent Bob Jr . ' s grandfather , William Howard Taft , to the presidency and established his father in the Senate as the nation 's " Mr. Republican . " But beyond that , " young " Bob , in his cool , deliberate manner , has carefully cultivated a reputation of his own as a constructive legislator in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress . Many Republicans see Taft , 47 , as one of the party 's most likely new national leaders . <P> Taft is trying to unseat Democratic Senator Stephen Young , 75 , who startled Ohio back in 1958 when he managed to upset Republican Senator John Bricker . Most political observers figured in the past that Taft was a cinch to clobber Young . But as of last week , the Taft-Young race was surprisingly tight . Taft 's big worry is not Steve Young but Barry Goldwater. who could lose Ohio by such a whopping margin that he might drag Taft down to defeat too . <P> <P> Aware of that possibility , Taft is trying to remain true to his own conservative principles , yet taking equal pains not to embrace Barry too boldly . " I agree with him on most of the important issues , " Taft tells his audiences . But then he makes clear that this certainly does not include Goldwater 's negative stands on the civil rights bill , test-ban treaty and general federal aid to education . He has agreed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state , but Taft plans to slip quietly away from Barry in those regions where he hopes to pick up non-G.O.P. votes . <P> At the Fair . Steve Young , noted for his dyspeptic letters to constituents , * is aware that his only hope for survival lies in trying to tag Taft as one of Barry 's boys . " Goldwaterism , Taft Juniorism and extremism are all the same commodity , " he charges . " I am against Birch , Barry and Bob . " While that kind of pitch may prove effective , Young also bears a heavy handicap : many Ohio voters fail even to recognize him when he meets them in the street . Taft , on the other hand , is forever being introduced as " Senator Taft " before he makes it on his own . <P> While Taft still is favored to win , he is running scared-hitting as many as three county fairs in a single day to stay ahead . In the end , he may well stand or fall on how many Johnson voters will take the trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dear Sir-You should know that some crackpot is writing me letters and signing your name .
