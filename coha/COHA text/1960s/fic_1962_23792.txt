The Hemingway Influence A Story by ANTHONY OSTROFF I W A S sick in bed the day the letter came . It was quite a blow . I had applied for a job in South America with the government , and after I had applied and we were interviewed and the panel had told us we would be very good , and that after the security check , which was only a matter of form , we 'd hear from them , we got very excited about the prospect and began counting on it . " Servants ! " I would say , joyfully forget . ting about democracy . We can have servants . A nurse . Or a governess . " And we would plan how we could go out to the bars and cafes and even off on weekends together . The letter was a form letter saying I did n't get the job . I showed it to June . " Well , " she said , " it was your medical record . " There was no doubt of that . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except , as the VA wrote me , they could only pay me for 100 per cent . Later it went down to 10 per cent for a heart murmur . Nothing anymore for the jungle rot or the broken bones or the malaria ? which seemed fair enough : I was recovered . But it was some record , and there was no doubt the Civil Service men had checked it . The panel had been inquisitive enough about my health . " Now we know , anyway , " I said . " Dan , do you feel awful ? " " I du n no , " I said . " I guess they have to be careful about health in the lower echelons of the government . " " Do n't feel too bad about it , " she said . " I do n't feel bad about it , " I said . " Give me a little time . I 'll feel terrible about it in about an hour . " I do n't know why we talked like that . It was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rereading The Sun Also Rises that day . I might have got some of Hemingway 's rhythms mixed up with my own . In a way it was odd that I should have been rereading that book just then ? it certainly was n't a good time for it . I had been in bed two days with bronchitis , and that morning I had wandered into Charlie 's room , which was my study before he was born , and after a little disconsolation over the shelves , that was the book I decided to reappropriate . I had read a couple of chapters before the mail came . " Well , " June sighed . We put the letter away , and the remains of the morning began drifting by . June went back to her chores , and I went back to the bedroom and sat . Then Charlie got fed . Then we had lunch . Then I decided what the hell , and got dressed and went down to school to sec if I had any mail there . Maybe something , I thought . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I couldn'i go back to bed with all those surprises waiting for me in my mailbox clown at the high school . Even though it was Saturday when no one should have been there , Borden Edwards was in the department office . He was typing exams for his Senior English course . " Hi , Dan , " he said when I came in . " Christ , you look terrible . " I told him I felt terrible , but I did n't tell him about the letter . We talked awhile , and he took pity on me for being unshaven and hosing bronchitis , and gave me a package of Delicados , which he surreptitiously imports from Mexico since he ca n't stand American tobacco . The whole package was a 94 THE HEMINGWAY INFLUENCE gift , he said . I lit one of the cigarettes , which tasted very much like Gauloises Bleus and reminded me suddenly of the year June and I were in France and I smoked nothing but Gauloises Bleus , at first because I could n't afford better , but then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Borden went back to his typing , which he said he had to finish by three o'clock when he was picking up his wife at the Co-op , where she worked . I puffed on my GaidoiseBleu-Delicado and thought about our year in France and how it seemed we 'd never have a year like that again , and wondered how in hell Borden had happened to get hooked on Delicados . No more mail . On my way home I stopped at the grocery store to buy some Kleenex , and there I saw some Tobler chocolate bars . In all the years I had gone into the store they had never had them before , and I asked the woman who runs the store about it and she said they had just got them a week ago . There were four or five different kinds . I remembered how in France we were always surprised at how many kinds of chocolate there were , and how we kept eating various species of Tobler bars . Remembering , it seemed we had eaten nothing but Tobler chocolate and the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar of the chocolate and took it home with me . When I got home there was a bottle of Louis Martini burgundy sitting on the living-room table . " Where did this come from ? " I asked . " Margaret Jones brought it . She just left a few minutes ago , " June said . She was sitting on the floor trying to fix Charlie 's stroller , which kept coming apart . " Well , it 's nice to have a rich friend , " I said , June smiled at me bravely . I went over to look at exactly what she was trying to do . After a minute I bent down and took the stroller away from her and snapped the loose , wire foot-platForm into place . " Okay , " I said . " Now I 'm feeling lousy . You tell Margaret about it ? " June nodded . " Might as well tell them all , " I said . " I wish we could call a meeting and tell them all at Anthony Ostroff 's first volume of poems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harcourt , Brace &; World , and his stories have appeared in " The Paris Review , " " Best American Short Stories , " and elsewhere . He is associate professor of English at the University of California , Berkeley.once . Then we would n't have to go over it twice . " " I know , " June said , I saw she was getting ready to cry as she got up and started off toward the kitchen . By way of apology I asked if we should open the wine . " No , " she said , " let 's save it for dinner . " I WAS beginning to feel a little shaky , and my chest was aching , so I went upstairs and got into my pajamas and crawled into bed again . I read another two chapters of Hemingway 's book , and then ate some of the Tobler bar . I tried to remember how many kinds of Tobler bars there had been . It was nine years since my GI Bill had run out and we had had to come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , the worse everything seemed . It had been in the back of my mind that the Army record might undo me , but I 'd dismissed it . The investigation was for security purposes , and I had thought they might not care about my little pension , even in spite of the questions they had asked me about it . Evidently I 'd been wrong . The sad thing about it was that there was nothing ease to try . We were stuck with my teaching job . " It would n't matter so much if you did n't mind your job here , " June said when she came in and sat on the edge of the bed and we began talking about it all again . " It 's a nice place to live . It 's as nice as anyplace . " " Sure , " I said , " Sure . " She knew what I meant . We were broke . Just perpetually broke . The salary was n't enough to live on , and the job had turned into a grinding humiliation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The trouble is , we want too much . We 've got to learn to enjoy what we have . " " That 's the trick , all right , " I said , " Where did you get this ? " she asked me . She had picked up the candy bar . I told her about it , and we began talking about France , and about how we could work things so we could make out and I could maybe even have some time to work at something better , and how finally there was no way and we were just poor , poor , poor . At last June could n't stand it and she began crying a little . " All my life , " she said , " it 's always been the same problem . Just never having enough money . " " Well , you have that fine chestnut hair , " I said , trying to cheer her up , " and you 've got Charlie and me . " " Oh , darling , " she said , bursting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's so awful . I get so damned mad at the world ! " So there we were . We got cheered up a little , after while , and then had supper and some of the wine , but my bronchitis seemed worse and I was n't up to killing the bottle . After supper Charlie fussed , then June got him to sleep and came in to talk some more , and we got terribly depressed again . Charlie , maybe  --  maybe Charlie would grow up and make out better , we said . Finally 1 relented and got June calmed down and to bed . She slept in the living-room so she would n't catch my cold and give it to Charlie . After she was in bed I read more of the book , and it was everything we were missing  --  the being places you loved and seeing things and talking to people . I told myself it was a hell of a romance and nobody ever talked like that or staved drunk that much of the time , but all the while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had our year in France and bicycled through the Alps and Provence , and at last gone down to Nimes and Arles for the bullfights , and all in all it had been a pretty good Hemingwayish year . The trouble was , it had faded pretty much . I could n't remember all the details anymore . By the time I quit reading and was ready to fall asleep , I decided June was right . You had to do with what you had . And actually we had a lot , living in Berkeley , California . Right in front of us were the bay and San Francisco , and there were the hills around , and beautiful country , and even if we were broke we ought to be able to do something worth doing in such a place . I could n't see why I could n't drive down to the harbor and talk to people there , or just look at the docks and get something out of that . " In fact , " I said to myself , remembering Hemingway , " you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn your bronchitis . " I tried not to think about the fact that June would have to stay home and take care of Charlie , or it would have to be the other way around and in any case we could n't bum around together anymore . T H F. next morning my fever was gone , and though I felt weak and thought I 'd be smart to stay in bed , I got up and dressed . " Where do you think you 're going ? " June asked when she saw me . " Out , " I said . " As soon as I 've had breakfast . " - But that 's silly . You have to go to work Monday . You ought to stay in bed today , or at least stay in the house . " " No , " I said , " I 'm going out . See what I can do with what we 've got . " " Oh , Dan . Do n't be silly . " " Do n't mess with it , " I warned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went out , leaving June with the dishes and Charlie 's laundry to do , and Charlie bawling for attention from his playpen . It was a nice day . It had rained for a week , but finally it had cleared . The wind was wet , so you felt the white clouds blowing up from the ocean were really loaded with water , but the sun was bright . From the road where the car was parked I could see part of the hay . It still had that cold , shredded-lead look of winter , but at least the air was clear . I decided to drive down to the waterfront . I had the San Francisco waterfront in mind , but by the time I got to the Bay Shore highway I was already feeling San Francisco was too far to go and I should n't spend the money on gas and bridge tolls , so I crossed over to the Berkeley yacht harbor . There is a long causeway going out from the shore to the boat basin . It is made of mud and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrow road and got out . The wind was cold and blowing hard . I looked down the embankment below the car . The water was muddy , blowing up against the rocks with little cold-looking splashes . There was a Negro family down among the rocks , fishing . Two old men and an old woman and a fat , middle-aged woman and three or four little kids . I watched them for a few minutes , wondering what sort of fish they could catch there . Two of the kids were standing on a big rock , disconsolately tossing stones into the water . The two old men and the women huddled in their dark clothes , patiently blinking at their lines . None of them even looked at me . I turned and crossed the road and walked out on the pier that makes the south side of the harbor . There were various sounds in the wind ? the creaking and yawning of hawsers , and boats groaning against their bumpers , and the cries of the gulls . I walked out to the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were all shapes and sizes . Even the old gray crab-boats seemed clean in the lineup , floating between their moorings . But there was no sign of life until I saw a man and a woman sitting in the bridge cabin of a large cabin cruiser . The man was wearing a black turtleneck and a captain 's cap , and he seemed to be talking to the woman , 96 THE HEMINGWAY INFLUENCE who looked bored , about a map he was holding . Beyond them was the latticework of piers and other boats , and then the cold bay . One of the ventilators on deck was going around . At the main cross pier , an old Coast Guard cutter was tied . ' There was a For Sale sign on the ramp going down to her side . 17,500 , " it said . The boat looked pretty much wrecked . The gray paint was scaling off the superstructure and there were rust stains from all the fittings . The hull was wood . I wondered why no one bought it . It seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortably . You could n't buy a house as big for twice the price . But then I thought of how much work it would probably take to fix the boat up . Living on it was a nice idea in the abstract , but very desolate in reality . I noticed there were broken rat guards on the mooring lines . The cold wind had got to me , and I decided to go . As I approached the main pier a small brown dog came trotting out to meet me . I smiled at him and called and he frisked to me . I bent down and ruffed his neck and patted him , but when I stood up and continued on my way the dog , after an uncertain look at me , went off in his own direction . By the time I reached the car I felt frozen . The sky had become gray and overcast over San Francisco and the bay , though it was still clear over the Berkeley and Oakland hills behind me . A SHORT distance across the Bay Shore highway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It began as a store and tiny sea-food place , run by the Spengers and stocked with the fish they caught . Now it is large and the best sea-food restaurant in the area , though prices are still reasonable and nothing has become too fancy . I went there for lunch . It was early for Sunday lunch , and the place was not yet crowded . I sat in a corner of the lowest-ceilinged room and ordered a bowl of chowder and a beer . I had just enough to pay for it and leave a barely passable tip . The chowder was very hot and very good , I finished it before the beer , and then sat smoking a cigarette and thinking . I sat and thought about how I should be thinking about what if a beautiful woman came in and knew me and sat down at my table , or what if one of our painter friends from back East came in , or Halliday or one of our friends from Europe , and sat down with me and we could drink and talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someplace or round up some people for a party . Then I thought bow I wished June were there and we could get a little drunk maybe and maybe have dinner and then go off someplace and make love . I was having my fine , stylized time , all right . The waiters at Spengers wear gray jackets and black pants and black neckties . They seem to be mostly Italian . My waiter had black hair and dark eves and wore steel-rimmed glasses . He looked tired and full of pep all at once . He came over and wanted to bring me some coffee , but I asked for the check instead . On the table in front of me , which had a gray formica top , were the dishes I had used  --  my empty chowder bowl and beer bottle , butter dish , beer and water glasses , and a plate with a piece of French bread I 'd left . At the side , against the wall , the condiments stood in a solid clump like a castle : sugar jar , big salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tower of catsup , half full , and a bottle of ' Worcestershire sauce . I looked it all over and decided it was certainly the stuff the world was made of . I left my money on the check and went outside . The overcast had reached the hills , the tops of which were shrouded in mist . I got in my car and started for home , waiting for the rain to begin , though it did n't actually start again until that night . On the way borne I thought , well , I had proved it . You just had to look at the world and there it was . The trouble was , it was n't sweet reality just because it was there . It depended on what you were doing when you did your looking  --  whether you were young enough , or on a vacation or not . That sweet-sad world of Hemingway 's just passed into fiction . The thing about it was that none of the characters in it had any k iris . It struck me as a revelation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids ! " Do you know what ? " I said when I got home and had told June where I 'd been . " None of Hemingway 's people ever have any children . I mean babies . Absolutely none of them . " " If you think you 're casting aspersions on Charlie you can just shut up , " June told me . Charlie waved at me madly from his playpen and smiled and said , " Ahhhill " I went over and picked him up . I swung him into the air , and he shouted and gave his gurgling laugh and seemed beside himself with joy . " How 's that , Charlie ? " I said , holding him up over my head . He crooned and gaped with delight . His eyes were blue as the Mediterranean , inside his grin . Well , that 's how it goes . Harper 's Magazine , November .1962
