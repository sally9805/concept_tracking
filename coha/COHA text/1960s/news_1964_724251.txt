txt Washington , Sept. 24 ? The Senate passed President Johnson 's 3.3 billion dollar foreign aid authorization bill tonight ? an action that will skyrocket the nation 's foreign aid spending to just under 130 billion dollars since the world-wide give-away program began in 1947 . The total included interest paid by the taxpayers on money the government borrowed to make possible its bounty . With many senators absent , the vote was 45 to 16 . Condemn Red Persecution In a sudden rush for passage , the Senate voted 60 to 1 for an amendment condemning Russia for persecution of Jews , over objections by the state department : The single opposition vote was cast by Sen. William Fulbright D. , Ark. , chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee . Heedful of the state department 's desire not to offend Russia , Fulbright tried unsuccessfully to change the condemnation to include all nations guilty of religious persecution . The condemnation was the proposal of Sen. Abraham Ribicoff D. , Conn . . Another last minute action was the adoption of an amendment by Sen. George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipients of contracts under the aid program . Bill Goes to Conference The bill goes to a SenateHouse conference for adjustment with the authorization bill passed by the House . The House authorized the full 3.5 billion dollars asked by Johnson , but imposed a limitation on spending that would cut the actual funds to the same figure as the Senate approved . The appropriation is yet to be voted , but it was predicted that the 3.3 billion dollars would be approved . The aid program , subject of bitter debate in other years , encountered surprisingly little opposition this year .
