The Second Sex Revisited LES BELLES IMAGES by Simone de Beauvoir . 224 pages . Putnam. $4.95 . <P> <P> When Simone de Beauvoir ( The Second Sex ) casts her cold , existentialist eye on the predicament of modern woman , the author emerges like a tough-minded , hardhearted Fransoise Sagan . Les Belles Images has sold over 100,000 copies in France for reasons that have nothing to do with the art of fiction . In its brief compass ( long enough to irritate , short enough to finish between lunch and cocktails ) , the novel lambastes modern life , love , marriage and values with thoroughgoing cynicism . It is bound to have an insidious appeal : it can make a woman wallow in self-pity . The scene is a Paris rapidly becoming Americanized . The heroine is Laurence , the ultramodern career woman ( advertising , of course ) with a successful architect husband , two sweet little girls , and a lover always on tap ( chap who works in her office ) . She is suffocating in a sea of materialism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

As for her husband 's building developments , they represent nothing but built-in , functional ugliness . As a man , she concludes , he is just another cipher , an interchangeable part ( " Why him rather than anyone else ? " ) . <P> Laurence has other troubles . Mother , a hard-bitten success herself , is about to lose her 56-year-old lover to a 19-year-old girl . Father , a charming bookworm with a sense of history , seems like the only decent refuge , the one who places truth and integrity above success and money . Even Laurence 's once sweet adultery now seems merely " functionalism . " Small wonder that she is heading toward a crackup . <P> All the outward affluence and fake wellbeing , says Author de Beauvoir , are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the very last page , there seems to be a smidgen of vague hope , at least for the children-maybe . That is small compensation for a novel that is distinguished otherwise only for its predictable course and Gallic ennui .
