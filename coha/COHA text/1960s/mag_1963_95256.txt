I started this series of articles last week by saying it , and now I want to say it again : Golf is a deceptively simple game . It is 90% mental . It is a game to be relished , savored and enjoyed , and it is only played well when these pleasures are in evidence . Books , and indeed whole series of books , have been written analyzing the hitting of a golf ball as if it were a rocket launching that involved half a million complicated parts , any one of which might suddenly fail . It is n't . There are very few really important things to know about the golf grip and swing . Therefore what follows on these pages is about all of the technical golf instruction I will offer you , because it is all you need . It is divided into three segments  --  the grip , the head and feet , and the compact swing . // The Grip // The single most fundamental and most neglected aspect of golf is the grip . Without the right grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can develop a swing that is a perfect picture of grace and balance and yet you can never play anywhere near your potential . With the right grip you can make all kinds of other mistakes . It is the cardinal virtue that can compensate for a dozen golfing sins . Yet rare is the golfer with a good grip . Even some of the touring pros have never learned its secret . // The first thing a person does when he decides to give golf a try is to pick up a club . Unfortunately , the " natural " way to pick it up  --  after years of holding baseball bats , suitcase handles , brooms or frying pans  --  is the wrong way , and it is at this moment that lifelong duffers are born . // There is only one right way to grip a golf club . The grip has to keep both hands locked together and working together , and it has to hold the club tight enough to avoid even the slightest turning in the hands , while at the same time leaving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the color photographs , and I will explain how to accomplish this double objective . // Let us start with the left hand , where the last three fingers do the work . They have to hold the shaft tight against the palm  --  tight enough so that it ca n't turn , yet not so tight as to get cramped and stiff . You lay the shaft diagonally across the left palm , from the base of the index finger to the opposite corner , then close the last three fingers snugly . The forefinger and thumb play a secondary role . They help steady your hold on the club and give you the necessary sense of " feel . " // Now put the right hand on the club . Here the two middle fingers do the job . Like the last three fingers of the left hand , they apply the pressure  --  tight enough to keep the club from turning , but not unnaturally tight . The little finger of the right hand overlaps the index finger of the left hand and forms a link between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , of course , the Vardon overlapping grip , which is used by almost all golfers today . ) The thumb and forefinger , like the thumb and forefinger of the left hand , help steady your grip and give you the feel of the club . But it is the middle two fingers that do most of the work . I have heavy callouses running almost the entire length of my two middle fingers ( see below ) and almost no callouses anywhere else . // There is one other thing to watch about the right hand . Notice that if you start to close the fingers of your hand , as if about to make a fist , a little pocket forms in the palm ( see right ) . It runs from the heel of the hand  --  the lower left corner as you look at it  --  diagonally up toward the base of the index finger . This pocket is very important . When you put your right hand on the club this pocket must fit over your left thumb . Then the part of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressing against the left thumb with a good , snug hold . // If you are holding the club with the last three fingers of your left hand and the middle two fingers of your right hand , and if your left thumb is cradled firmly in that little pocket of your right hand , with the part of the right hand below the thumb keeping a steady pressure , then you 've got it . // What you have done  --  and you can see this for yourself  --  is firm up and consolidate your grip to the point where there is an absolute minimum of air space anywhere between your hand and the club . Your grip is so steady that the stress of the backswing is not going to jar it loose at any point . Nor will the shock of impact when you hit the ball , a shock that is much more they can work as a team . As your wrists start breaking on the backswing , they can move in perfect unison ; they wo n't fight each other as they do in most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put into the club all the whip of which your muscles are capable . // You may not be happy with your grip at the start . You can tell by looking at it that it is absolutely right , according to all principles of physiology and engineering , but it probably wo n't feel good the first time you try it  --  there is an old saying around golf courses that if a grip feels comfortable at the start there is probably something wrong with it . You may find that the two pressure fingers of your right hand are not used to doing that kind of work and tend to get tired and sore . You may have trouble keeping the pressure on with your right hand below the thumb . But believe me , this is the right way to hold the club . Master it and you are more than halfway home as a golfer . // Now then , about those famous Vs . I have left them until last because their importance has been stressed so much in recent golf teaching that the basic principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all right . But they are a refinement of the grip , not the fundamental part of it . // The Vs are the angles formed by your thumbs and forefingers as you grip the club , and where the Vs point depends on where you have placed your hands on the shaft . The standard advice given by most pros is that you should place the left hand on the shaft so that when you look down on it from the position in which you address the shot , you can see two knuckles , the knuckle of the index finger and the one next to it . Then , after you have put your right hand on the club , you should have the Vs of both hands pointing toward your right shoulder . // This is a useful generalization , and as true as most generalizations , but it can get you into trouble . A little golfing theory is in order here . If you address the ball with your hands somewhat toward the right as they lie on the club  --  that is to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right shoulder , or even beyond  --  then your hands , as they move into their natural position in the hitting area , will be closing the face of the club a little . // When the Vs point well to the right we call it a " strong " grip ( see above ) . By closing the club face at the point of impact ; the " strong " grip tends to overcome any natural inclination to slice . // When the Vs point straight up and down we call it a " weak " grip . By opening the club face at the point of impact , this " weak " grip tends to overcome any natural tendency to hook . // So the fact of the matter is that no two golfers should ever see exactly the same number of knuckles on the left hand . The ideal number for you may just happen to be two , as the guidebook says  --  but it is much more likely to be some queer fraction like 2.367 or 1.835 . Your Vs should perhaps point to the seam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adam 's apple , all depending on your swing . Every player is a little different , and all players may change from time to time . // Most professional golfers have a natural tendency to hook the ball . ( A slight hook is a great asset . All other things being equal , the beginner who finds that he hooks the ball right from the start will turn out to be a better golfer than the beginner who slices it . ) Playing day in and day out , moreover , develops the hands and wrists , and this further encourages a hook . So a great many pros use the weak grip . You can see in the color photographs that my own grip is very much in this direction . The V of my left hand usually points to my chin , the V of my right hand to the inside of my right shoulder . But do n't copy my Vs . They quite likely are not right for you . // Most weekend amateurs have a tendency to slice and should use the strong grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season , after a long winter in which the golfing muscles were never used . It would be less true in the middle of a long vacation when the amateur was playing every day . At such a time , when lots of golf has toned up his muscles , he will almost surely start hooking the ball unless he moves his hands a little to the left . The best way to find out for sure where your Vs should point is to take some lessons and get your pro 's advice . The only other way is through trial and error . If you are consistently slicing , move the Vs to the right . If you are consistently hooking , move them to the left . But do n't let any shifting of the hands on the club cause you to change the proper pressures and positions of the basic grip . Nothing must change that . // There are two other types of grip : the baseball and the interlocking . If your hands are unusually weak or unusually small , you may get a better hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think , would profit from using the baseball grip . So probably would many older players who have begun to get a touch of arthritis or rheumatism in their hands . Both these grips , however , are simply variations on a theme . You still have to apply the same pressures and firmness as you do when using the Vardon grip . // The Head and Feet // We have to talk about the head and feet before we can talk about the swing , because they are the anchor points around which the entire swing revolves . Unless you have got your feet firmly planted on the turf , and your head firmly fixed at one definite spot , your swing can not be steady enough to be any good . // Actually , there is not much you have to worry about as far as your feet are concerned . You just want to get comfortable . You do not want your feet so far apart that they will keep you from turning your body smoothly . Nor do you want them too close together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand up to the ball naturally , you will find that your stance tends to be about as wide as your shoulders when you are using a driver . Then as you move down to the shorter clubs your feet tend to move closer together , until they are perhaps no more than six inches apart when you are choking the pitching wedge for a little 30-yarder . This moving of the feet closer together is possible , of course , because the arc of the swing is getting smaller . The relative amount of stability you are getting remains the same . // As far as the angle of your feet is concerned , they will be all right if you just get set in the position that seems to be the best balanced . Ordinarily , the way most golfers do it , the left foot is at a slight angle , with the toe pointed out toward the hole . The right foot is either more or less perpendicular to the line of flight or also pointed a little to the left . It does n't really matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed stance , of course . The stance with the wedge usually is quite open ; the left foot is moved well back from the intended line of flight . Then as you go to the longer clubs the stance gradually closes , a little more with each club . With the driver , the stance is completely square , with the feet placed evenly on the line of flight , or somewhat closed , with the right foot drawn back from the line . Again , this seems to be something that usually happens by itself as the golfer just tries to get comfortable . // A big part of feeling good over the ball is to have the feet planted solidly from toe to heel , like a brick sitting in the turf . You want all those spikes dug in , nice and firm . To achieve this , you have got to flex your knees a little so that you are " sitting down to the ball , " as the saying goes . Actually , you are standing just about as you might if you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or as if you were water-skiing . Your knees are bent just enough to make your legs feel flexible and relaxed . They are all set to help you make a smooth , easy turn as you start your swing . // As you stand up to the ball , you are not so far away that you have to crouch to reach it or so close that you have to stand stiffly upright . You are bent forward a little at the waist , and your arms hang loosely . You may want to check yourself against the drawings below and on the following page , because this is the part of the stance that seems to cause more trouble than any other for the golfer whose practice time is limited . // Many amateurs make the golf swing harder than it is by standing well away from the ball  --  which forces them to crouch and bend too far . You see more people bending too far over the ball than standing too erect . This throws their weight forward onto the balls of their feet and gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless your feet are fixed so firmly and your weight is so evenly in balance that you feel like a basketball player who is on guard and ready to move either right or left . Aside from this trouble spot , there is not much to worry about as far as the feet are concerned . // If only this were true of the head ! But the head is a different matter entirely . You ca n't consistently execute a good golf shot unless you keep your head entirely still over the ball  --  and holding the head still is n't easy . Even the pros , gifted with a maximum of natural ability , have had to spend years concentrating on holding their heads steady , and they will still move them from time to time in spite of all their efforts . // If you raise your head during the swing , you are going to top the ball , or at best get nothing more than a very low , flat shot , with no distance . If you lower your head during the swing , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " fat , " taking some turf before impact . If you move your head to the left , you get a drastic hook . If you move your head to the right , you can also get a hook or , more likely , a bad slice or push to the right . // Many golfers think it is easy to keep the head steady . They think that all you have to do is keep your eye on the ball . Thus when the amateur tops a shot his friends say , " You looked up . " They are wrong . At least , they are usually wrong because , though you may move your head as a result of taking your eye off the ball , keeping your eye on it provides no guarantee that your head will remain steady . Your eyes and head work independently . So it is not enough just to keep your eye on the ball . You must consciously and deliberately force your head to hold still . This takes prolonged effort and concentration . It probably is the hardest part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays golf , I was once a head-mover . I do n't do it anymore , though  --  at least not very often . In fact , I suppose that holding my head still is the thing I do best in golf . I move it hardly a fraction of an inch on the backswing or a fraction of an inch on the downswing , at least not until long after the ball is in the air . Look at the color picture at right . Notice that in all the action of that swing my head has moved hardly at all . If everybody could learn to hold his head still , there would n't be any golfers around still trying vainly to break 100 . In fact , there would n't be any 90 shooters . Everybody would be playing in the 70s or the low 80s . This would be a real happy country . // I wish I could give you 10 easy rules for how to do it , but I can not . I fought the problem for years . I worked on my grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I learned to get comfortable over the ball so that I could forget my feet . I learned about the compact swing  --  that 's relatively easy , as you 'll see shortly  --  and quit worrying about that part of the game . And then I concentrated on holding my head still . I thought about it almost every time I hit the ball . I made up my mind to hold steady . When I moved on a shot , I forced myself to do better the next time . Getting comfortable over the ball is part of it : if you have good balance and your feet are firmly placed you have a far better chance to hold steady . Relaxation is part of it : if your body movements flow free and easy there is no irresistible physical force to pull you off your axis and make you sway . But it is mostly a matter of concentration : you have got to be determined to hold steady . And after that it is a matter of practice . // I do n't think there is any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head still . You have just got to think about it and practice it until it becomes second nature . You can never forget the head entirely . Even now , if I do not keep reminding myself from time to time that I must keep my head steady , I would go right back to moving it again . // Are you doing it ? I would say that if you have a halfway decent grip and are still shooting over 90 , you are almost surely moving your head , and have been ever since you took up golf . If you used to shoot in the 70s but have gone up into the 80s , you have acquired the habit . You will have to work on the problem . All I can do is wish you good concentration  --  and good luck . The result will be worth it . As you may have observed if you have ever watched me play , I have one of the biggest " turns " in golf . By this I mean that when I take the clubhead back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have virtually turned my back to the spot where I am aiming the ball . My left hip swings way around , and so do my shoulders . // Did I plan my swing that way ? No , I never did . Neither did my father , when he was teaching me the game . In fact , at one of my early professional tournaments , when many of the other pros were seeing me play for the first time , one of them nudged my father , who was also watching me , and asked , " Did you teach him that turn ? " My father replied , " Now would n't that have been a silly thing to do ? " // What he meant was that a teaching pro should not urge his pupils to think one way or another about the body turn . The golfer himself should never worry about whether he is making a large turn or a small one . I certainly never think about it . The only reason I know I have a big turn is that other golfers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself in pictures . And the only reason I have this kind of turn is that it comes naturally to me . Given my kind of physique , and the kind of physical condition that results from playing nearly every day , my hands and arms just naturally pull my body around into a big turn when I take the clubhead back . // Such a turn is a wonderful asset in golf , for the turn generates power , and the bigger the turn the greater the power . But it is not something you should plan or worry about . If your leg , torso and shoulder muscles have the strength and agility to give you a big turn , you will have it . If not , you will have to  --  and should  --  settle for a little less . // As a matter of fact , almost everything that has been written or discussed about the golf swing  --  all the millions of words devoted to the turn , the pivot and the weight shift  --  has been unnecessarily complicated and confusing . I urge you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swing is the easiest part of golf . Once you have got the right grip  --  and once you hold your head steady  --  it is almost physically impossible to swing badly . There are two rules and two rules only that you have to remember about the swing . You can make them part of your second nature in a mere half hour on the practice tee . // Rule No. 1 is to take the club back smoothly and without breaking your wrists as you start your backswing . You have to take it straight back " in one piece , " as they say around the golf course , without any wrist action at all . Do this for the first 12 inches that the clubhead moves , and you have got the swing practically licked . Look at the color photograph at left and you will see exactly how this is done . // Starting the club this way gets your entire body into the act . To take the club back in one piece you have to use your leg muscles , your torso muscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice , easy , well-coordinated pattern of motion , from feet to shoulders . And now you can forget everything else you have ever heard about how the body and arms are supposed to behave during the swing , for once you are past that important first 12 inches you would have to be a genius to manage to do anything wrong . // Do you have to worry about swinging " inside out , " that ideal we hear so much about ? No . The clubhead has to come inside out if it is started back correctly . Do you have to worry about shifting your weight ? Of course not . All the standard advice about shifting the weight is completely unnecessary . It is worse than that : it is confusing and harmful . If you take the club back in one piece , your weight just naturally shifts to the right foot . You can not help shifting your weight . You do not have to think about it any more than you have to think which foot to move next when you are walking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung the clubhead back as far as you can and get ready to hit the ball . As you start your downswing , your weight must shift to your left foot . If you did not shift your weight you would be standing there with your arms in the air the rest of the day . // What must have happened somewhere back in golfing history is that a theoretician noticed that golfers shift their weight in this manner and promptly decided to turn it into a law . But in putting the facts into a rule of instruction , he got them backward . Instead of saying what was the fact , namely , that when you take your backswing your weight shifts to the right foot , and when you take your downswing your weight shifts to the left foot , he made everybody nervous by claiming that you must consciously shift your weight to swing properly . What had always been an instinctive movement became a self-conscious and awkward chore . It was as if he had announced , " To breathe properly , one must always exhale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You breathe in and out from the moment of birth without thinking about it . If you start worrying about it . it gets to be a problem . // What is true about the weight shift is also true about the turn , or pivot . The theoreticians are correct when they say that the golf swing is like " turning in a barrel " or " ' turning like a barber pole . " If you think of yourself as having an imaginary pole running from your head to your feet , it is correct that this pole simply revolves on its axis , first to the right on your backswing , then to the left on the downswing . The pole does n't sway or shift laterally . But you do n't have to think about this to achieve it . You can not possibly take a backswing , if you start the club back as I have said , without turning your body . About the only way you can manage to do it wrong is to start thinking about it . // Rule No. 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or , to use a phrase that I like , to keep the swing compact . It is an easy rule to follow ; at least , it should be . Yet , strangely , many pros violate it at times , and most amateurs violate it most of the time . // We all like to hit the ball as far as we can , and the best way to hit it a mile seems to be to take the biggest possible wind-up . I say seems . What the natural human urge for power often does is make us strain too hard , take too big a backswing , lose control of the club and dissipate our power completely . // Each of us has his own limits . We can take the club back just so far , and no farther . For most pros , the distance is considerable . Many of them have such a long backswing that the club goes up and around all the way to the horizontal , and even past the horizontal , until it is actually dipping toward the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with muscles and joints kept loose and limber through constant exercise  --  can hope to duplicate this kind of swing . Most amateurs can not take the club back nearly as far as the horizontal . Many of them would play better golf if they never tried to take it past the perpendicular . // You must keep the swing well within your physical capabilities . The moment you feel that you are stretching yourself on the backswing , the moment you feel that you are fighting the weight of the club instead of remaining easily in control of it , you have swung too far . And when you go too far , one of two things happens . Either you bend your left elbow or you loosen your grip . Either way , you are lost . // Bending the left elbow is the common error of beginners , and also , I have noticed , of older golfers who are still trying to take the same kind of backswing that they took when their muscles and joints were more flexible . At least one out of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left elbow consistently , or at least on every shot where he is trying for extra distance . // Loosening the grip is a fault so common that it , too , affects the pros at times . The arms go up , around and back as far as they can . Still the player is not satisfied . He feels he should wind up a little more . He strives to get the club down past that horizontal line . If he keeps his left arm straight , as all good golfers do , there is only one way he can get the club to move any farther . He has to let loose with his hands and let the club wobble of its own weight . Some golfers let loose with the thick part of the right hand beneath the thumb . Others make an even more deadly mistake : they let go with the last three fingers of the left hand . // Almost all the British pros I have seen in tournament play tend to loosen their grip at the top of the backswing . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play less often than do our American pros . Their golfing season does not last nearly as long as ours . Lacking the lubrication of joint and tendon that can only come from constant practice , they are physically unable to take the club back as far as American pros . Yet they know that it takes power to win any modern golf tournament . Striving for it , they let go of the club . // It does not take much loosening of the fingers to ruin a golf shot . Once you have relaxed your grip at the top of the backswing you have to tighten it again , and it would take a miracle to put your fingers back in exactly the same spot where they were before . They may not seem to have moved ; the difference may be only a thousandth of an inch , but that is enough to do the damage . The shaft of the club has turned in your hands , be it ever so slightly . You have nothing but trouble , all because you were looking for a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole matter of length is a lot less important than everybody seems to think . Among the pros , to be sure , it does make a difference . But the pros have to struggle constantly to get every last ounce of power into their shots . They are engaged in a game of inches . They are not just shooting to come up with a respectable 75 or even just to equal par ; instead they are fighting to win tournaments by being a mere quarter of a stroke better each 18 holes than the nearest opponent . To amateurs , five yards more or less on a drive means very little . To the average player it means nothing at all . The man who shoots around 100 is not suffering from lack of power , he is simply dubbing too many shots . // With the irons , distance means even less than with the woods , for the irons are not distance clubs at all . They are accuracy clubs . You are not trying to see how far you can powder the ball , you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pin . To show you something very important about the irons , I arranged the experiment shown in the drawings below . Please take a long look at them , for they contain a moral that every golfer should remember . In all of them I am using a five-iron . In the drawing on the right I am taking what for me is a slightly fuller than usual back-swing with this club . The shaft , as you can see , is nearly horizontal . In the middle drawing I am at the top of a three-quarter swing . In the drawing at the left I am taking a half swing . The club has gone back merely to the perpendicular . // From each of these backswings  --  the quite full , the three-quarter and the half swing  --  I then took my normal cut at the ball . I do not mean to say that I hit the ball as hard as I could , because I never do this with an iron ; I always stay a little within myself for greater accuracy . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit it . And here is the significant thing : // With my full swing , half a dozen shots made during the experiment averaged 165 yards . // With the three-quarter swing , my average was 160 yards . // With the half swing , my average was 150 yards . // What the experiment proves is that the length of the backswing produces very little difference in distance . Enlarging the arc of my swing all the way from the perpendicular to the nearly horizontal  --  a really tremendous difference in the length of the backswing  --  merely added 15 yards to my shot . I could have accomplished the same thing by going to a four-iron instead of a five-iron. // The moral , of course , is that you do not have to press for that extra couple of inches of backswing to get enough distance to be a good golfer . // Therefore keep that swing compact . Do not let the club get away from you . The minute you feel you are stretching or straining on the backswing , quit trying so hard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything that has been written and said about power golf in recent years , and even seems contrary to the way all the pros , including myself , play the game . // These contradictions , however , are apparent , not real . All the pros , with a very few exceptions , use the compact swing . The kind of swing they take is well under control and well within physical limits  --  for them . ( The few exceptions have such tremendous power and agility in their wrists that they can make up just before the moment of impact for any excesses of backswing . ) My own swing , though it involves the big turn I spoke of and carries the club way back to below the horizontal at times , is a compact swing  --  for me . I never feel a sense of strain at the top of my backswing . I never let my left elbow bend , or loosen my grip on the club . // If you want to keep trying to lengthen your backswing , while still keeping your swing compact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game to the hilt . And as you play more frequently , as you become more relaxed and more confident , you probably will find your muscles and joints moving more smoothly and flexibly . You will then be able to lengthen the arc of your swing while still keeping firm control . // On the other hand , if you are just an occasional golfer , playing a couple of times a month , you probably will find that you can score better using a half or three-quarter swing . Try it the next time you go out . Remind yourself before every shot to take something less than a full swing . On your iron shots , use a lower-numbered club if necessary . If you 've been in the 90s or over , I 'll make you a little bet that you shoot five strokes better than your average . An accurate player who does not get off the fairway and can hit the greens can easily shoot 85 , even if he never knocks the ball more than 150 yards . If you do n't believe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are feeling nice and relaxed on a good warm day , go out on the course with nothing longer than a six-iron in your bag . Now you ca n't possibly hit the ball more than 150 yards . You may think you are playing under a horrible handicap , but just see how few strokes it adds to your score . You may even find yourself with your best round of the season . // What about the " upright " swing versus the " flat " swing ? This is something I wish we did n't have to discuss at all . The upright swing , as you doubtless know , is one with an arc that tends to be almost perpendicular to the ground , with the club going almost straight up on the backswing , then almost straight down again . The flat swing is much more tilted , not as flat as the swing of a baseball bat , but definitely tending in that direction . // Most of the books say that you should keep striving for an upright swing , that the flat swing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Jack Nicklaus has become a champion with one of the most upright swings ever seen in professional golf , and Doug Ford has had great results over the years with a swing that is almost as flat as Mickey Mantle 's . My own swing is definitely on the flat side . But I never planned it that way , and , I 'm sure , neither did Nicklaus or Ford plan their swings . We are each swinging our natural way . // I will say this : If you go too far to the extreme in either direction , if your swing is too upright or too flat , you may have trouble , especially as you get older . You see very few good senior golfers with either an extremely upright or an extremely flat swing . But , in general , I do n't think you should worry about it . Almost always a tendency to either the flat or upright swing is merely the natural result of physical build . Do what comes easily , and let the other fellows argue the theory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will beat them . // The same goes for all the talk about where you should break your wrists on the backswing . Some people say you should never let them break until your hands have moved around past your right knee , others that you should wait until your hands are as high as your hips . All I can say is that if you start the clubhead back without any wrist action and get past that crucial first 12 inches , you do n't have to worry . If you asked me at what point in the backswing my own wrists begin to break , I would have to tell you that I do n't know . What is more , I do n't want to know . I can not think of any single piece of knowledge that would help me less , or be more likely to confuse me . Forget about the wrist break . // So you see the golf swing is a lot easier than has been advertised . You have just the two rules : Start the club back in one piece without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you continue back , keep in control of the club , keep your swing compact .
