txt Washington Every campaign year the complaints roll in : " Surely some better way can be found to finance the political ramnaigns ! " nponlp say . This year it 's the big contributors , the lobbyists , and even the higher-salaried , government workers who are complaining , because with campaign costs mounting ever higher , the bite is being applied ever more heavily to these sources of campaign funds . They are being asked to subscribe to $50- and $100-a-plate dinners  --  not only for Come On In Sen. Barry Goldwater welcomed Gov . William NV . Scranton 's announced candidacy for the GOP presidential nomination . The Arizona Senator is race front-runner . the presidential campaigns but for the individual campaigns of senators and congressmen . Along with these pressures rides the uneasy suspicion that it is corrupting to political morals , and sometimes to individual candidates ' morals , when the wealthy few  --  or the affluent many  --  pay the campaign costs . A A A Do they not expect something in return , it is asked . And is it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are solicited for $100 tickets for a " Lyndon B. Johnson Salute " affair ? and feel it 's safer to be on record as having contributed when promotions are being considered . Democratic and Republican spokesmen estimate that the 1960 campaigns , at all levels , cost something like $175 , - 000.000 . This year , the total figure may run over $200 , - 000,000 . There seems little promise of practicing economy . Candidates insist on wide television coverage and on zipping all over the country by airplane . A A A One estimate is that it costs $250,000 to put on a respectable senatorial campaign in a big industrial state , and $500,000 to run for governor . Reforms ? new ways of financing campaigns ? have been proposed year by year . The late President Kennedy had just about completed plans , before his assassination , for a public campaign to expand the ranks of lowly ntributors in the 1964 elections . The campaign was to be launched at a White House conference at which former President Eisenhower and other top figures in both parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small contributions from more John Q. Publics . The conference has never been rescheduled . Mr. Kennedy had established a bipartisan Commission on Campaign Costs which proposed these reforms among others : ? Limited tax credits to be granted on political contributions , to encourage such contributions . ? Abolition of archaic ( and unheeded ) limitations on the amounts that individuals or groups may contribute . ? An effective system of disclosure and publicity on the sources and uses of campaign money ( no easy task ) . The Kennedy proposals have not been adopted by the Johnson administration , although the late President , when he was Senator in 1956 , introduced a bill to make contributions of less than S100 deductible from income tax . Realistically , there are only so many ways to finance campaigns : by small individual contributions , by big sums from big party contributors ; by sums raised at such functions as $100-a-plate dinners ; by " free time " on the networks ; by ( as occasionally proposed ) direct appropriations from Congress . Year by year the costs mount , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinch ? as Senator Goldwater has lately indicated ? hits both parties . What will the wealthiest country in the world do to dignify its campaign financing ?
