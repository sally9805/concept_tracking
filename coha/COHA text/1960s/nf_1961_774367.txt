txt  | erations have also been a factor : in Atlanta , the case was deferred until after the 1958 re-election of Mayor William B. Hartsfield , an outstanding moderate for whom litigation might have been politically embarrassing . It was hoped that school boards would take the initiative . By 1957 , however , it became clear that Negroes had an exaggerated notion of the political forces working in their favor . Their lack of aggressiveness merely allowed the segregationists to take unchallenged control of the situation . Some Negroes still are afraid that widespread litigation may force southern moderates into the extremist camp , but not as many are afraid as they used to be . Henceforth it is doubtful if Negroes will refrain from legal action because of tactical considerations . In some communities there has been no suit for the simple reason that no person is willing to serve as a plaintiff . Even Negroes who feel intensely about segregation , who are willing to take personal abuse , who will serve as a plaintiff in a bus-desegregation or golf-course case , are hesitant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in jeopardy . Others willing to serve as plaintiffs can not be used , perhaps because of something in their children 's school records which would give authorities a convenient excuse for rejection , perhaps because of lack of proper residential qualifications , and so on . A more persistent deterrent to litigation is simply the lack of money . School-entry suits are expensive . It costs around $15,000 to take a case up through the judicial hierarchy . This figure excludes the services of attorneys for the central NAACP staff employed on an annual salary and the services of local attorneys who serve without fee . It does not include the expenses connected with administrative hearings or fees for physicians , psychologists , and other experts frequently needed to answer school board contentions ; that Negroes have been rejected because they lack emotional stability , and so on .  | The NAACP , practically the only organization supporting litigation , just does not have the resources to handle a large number of cases at any one time . It has failed to receive grass roots support . Of the seventeen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have joined the NAACP and they contribute to it for all purposes less than $1,000,000 a year . Does this mean that Negroes do not favor desegregation ? As far as the educated and articulate Negroes are concerned , the answer is clear : they are strongly opposed to segregation . They feel the impact of segregation intensly ; they are highly sensitive to the color line . They are fighting to abolish segregation not merely because it is a symbol of servitude , but because they want their children to attend a desegregated school . But what of the less educated Negroes ? the maids , the sharecroppers , the janitors , the yardmen ? It is hard to discover what they want . White southerners insist these Negroes favor segregation . But many Negroes have discovered that " to get along , go along , " and seldom do southern whites talk with Negroes other than those who are in a subservient status , or under circumstances in which Negroes would be encouraged to speak freely and frankly . Many southern whites get their information about Negroes only from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments of a Montgomery businessman who is sure that the Montgomery bus boycott was not popular among Negroes . How does he know ? His maid told him so . For decades the two races have coexisted in the South . In many areas the relations have been warm and affectionate , but there has been limited opportunity for free exchange of ideas . Even in the face of the lunch-counter protests , bus boycotts , and almost complete lack of expressed Negro sentiment for segregation , many white southerners are still convinced that all the trouble is the result of " outside agitators . " On the other side , even in the face of Little Rock and the political victories of segregation leaders , many Negroes remain convinced that all the opposi- tion stems from a few prejudiced " politicians . " The events of the last several decades make it abundantly clear that the two races have never really communicated with each other : Negroes underestimate the whites ' determination to maintain segregation ; whites underestimate the Negroes ' desire to abolish it . That most Negroes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is anxious to have his own children attend integrated schools , at least not immediately , when it means exposing them to the dangers and tensions of being among the first . It takes considerable sophistication and determination to weigh the long-range advantages of destroying the pattern of segregated schools against the short-run disadvantages for the Negro children who have to serve as pioneers . Throughout the South , where schools have been desegregated there has been no mass movement of Negroes into " white " schools . Many Negro parents are already straining their financial resources to send their children to school . They believe , rightly or wrongly , that if their children go to " white " schools the costs would be prohibitive . They think of having to buy better clothes , for their children as the center of attention will have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid making a " bad impression . " They are not unaffected by the feelings of inferiority generated by decades of discrimination ? many are afraid their children could not make a go of it in a " white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro community which make a Negro hesitant to speak out for segregation . But Negroes who refuse to sign petitions , or who are unwilling to serve as plaintiffs , or who refuse to send their children to " white " schools almost never say they favor segregation . When Nashville desegregated its first grade in 1957 , for example , only nineteen families entered children in the " white " schools , and only nine Negro children remained when the first half of the school year ended . An investigation into the reason why so few sent children to these schools revealed several factors . Because of segregated housing , only 126 out of 1400 Negro first-graders were eligible for enrollment . Of those who were eligible , fears of physical and  | economic reprisal kept many from enrolling . Others were reluctant to break the prevalent social pattern . A minister talked with parents and found among the most prominent responses the following : " I have an older child in the Negro school and my first-grader needs his protection . " " I am not well , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first week . " " The child is not well enough to go and register . " " We are planning to move to another community within Nashville . " " I do n't want to make my child a guinea pig . " " When these folks get off the school grounds and quit threatening on the telephone , I 'll send my child to the integrated school . " Nor does the fact that Negroes fail to join the NAACP in large numbers mean they are opposed to its goals . Negroes simply are not culturally conditioned to join political organizations or to contribute to support lawsuits . Decades of paternalism have created an attitude that these are activities for the rich and powerful . And litigation , by its complexity and technical nature and by its lack of dramatic moments , furnishes an ineffective peg around which to build a mass movement . One can hardly picket the judge or boycott the courtroom . Furthermore , the NAACP may in the eyes of the white world be the most prominent antisegregation organization , but to many Negroes their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against discrimination . Negroes are opposed to segregation . Almost all feel keenly that they have to face life with handicaps imposed on no other Americans and that these handicaps flow from segregation . Dis- crimination in education cuts deeply : an education to a Negro is the escape from poverty , a ticket from the world of domestic service into the life of the middle class . Nonetheless , most Negroes are fighting against the system of segregation rather than for the immediate opportunity to have their own children educated in integrated institutions . They do not want to go to " white " schools so much as they want to avoid being forced to attend " colored " schools . As one elderly Negro phrased it with respect to bus integration : " The seats at the back are just as good as those at the front . Most Negroes still sit in the back , even though we got the buses integrated . But we did n't fight for seats , we wanted to get rid of those signs . " Whatever the reason , the fact remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segregated than Negroes have fought to integrate them . In almost every instance the complaint initiating a case is the product of group action rather than a spontaneous move of an individual Negro . In almost every instance , the NAACP has been the channel to recruit and instruct plaintiffs , to provide the funds and furnish the lawyer . The decision to litigate is not made by a small group of master strategists sitting in New York . Thurgood Marshall and his staff may lead , guide , suggest , but they can not control the situation out of which the cases spring . Nothing could have been worse , for example , from the point of view of the NAACP 's overall strategy , than for rural-Deep-South Prince Edward and Clarendon Counties to serve as test cases . Yet when local Negroes rebelling against deplorable schools solicited the help of the NAACP legal staff , the lawyers felt they could not refuse it . Nor could they allow adverse rulings to go unchallenged : events have forced them to push a suit in areas where all the advantages are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage Negroes to petition school boards and to step forward as plaintiffs . Forms are often prepared in state headquarters and  | distributed to local chapters . In June 1955 , the NAACP Conference of Virginia Branches sent out a directive urging local units to find Negroes to sign these petitions , and cautioned that persons should be selected willing " to go all the way , since it may well be only the first step to an extended court fight . " The national office sent a field secretary to Dallas to help prepare petitions and instruct parents and children about how to act when they appear at " white " schools . Since it is illegal , or at least unethical , for lawyers to solicit clients , great care is taken to isolate the NAACP lawyers from these initial steps . They are not contacted until plaintiffs have come forward in search of legal assistance . The best plaintiffs are those who are not exposed to community pressures , and who have had enough education so they can not be led into damaging admissions . There is safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the more difficult it is for school boards to find some factor other than race to explain the exclusion of Negro children from white schools . With a large number of plaintiffs , it is less likely that school authorities will be able to drag out the suit for so long that all the children will have graduated before final judgment , and thus cloud the legal picture by the issue of " mootness . " The first step to initiate legal action is to petition school authorities to integrate . In Miami and New Orleans this is all that was done prior to the suit . In Dallas , Birmingham , and other cities , in addition , some Negro pupils went to schools nearest their homes on the first day of a new term . To the surprise of no one , they were refused admission . But the effort strengthens the contentions of the plaintiffs , joins the issues more cleanly , and makes it more difficult for school officials to pretend that schools are not being operated along racial lines . Why then is this not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be assigned to par- ticular schools ; they want the school systems integrated . But more importantly , human beings under the best of circumstances like to avoid face-to-face conflict or to postpone it for as long as possible . Many more are willing to sign petitions than to brave white hostility by taking children to white schools , an act comparable to facing enemy fire . The plaintiffs ' presentation of their case to the court is short and simple . They establish that the plaintiffs are Negroes , residents of the school district . They assert that the public schools are being operated on a segregated basis , that school authorities have not made a good faith attempt to desegregate , have moved with no speed , deliberate or otherwise . They call a few Negro parents and students to relate their attempts to secure admission to schools , and establish the fact that they live closer to " white " than to " colored " schools . Thus they contend the board of education is depriving Negroes of their rights secured by the Fourteenth Amendment and the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing on their requests for an injunction . On the face of it , a school board is hard-pressed to find legally convincing answers . The law is on the side of the plaintiffs . So the boards first seek to avoid a head-on clash , and try to persuade the judge to dismiss the complaint without even getting to the merits . Among the arguments they have used are the fol-lowing : 1 ) The complaint should be dismissed because the plaintiffs have failed to exhaust administrative remedies . 2 ) The complaint should be dismissed because the plaintiffs are not really interested in having their children admitted to " white " schools , but have been tricked into serving as plaintiffs to test the legality of the school program . In Houston , for example , the schools ' lawyers charged that the fact that the plaintiffs had called in national officers of the NAACP instead of relying exclusively on local counsel proved the case was trumped up .  | There is nothing unethical or illegal in Negroes becoming plaintiffs in order to challenge segregation , yet for political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only goal is to secure assignments for their own children to schools which are closer to their homes or which have better facilities . It seems obvious , however , that the first Negro students to attend " white " schools often do so at some sacrifice to their own education . The nine Negroes first assigned to Little Rock 's Central High were warriors fighting for principle ; it is doubtful if they personally received a better education at Central than they could have by remaining at the " colored " school , or that they went through a year of persecution just to save a few blocks ' walk . The judges have paid no attention to these charges that the plaintiffs are " insincere . " But the school lawyers almost got a legal opening into which they could have driven a major wedge when a three-man district court dismissed a petition for an injunction brought by O. Z. Evers , a colored citizen of Memphis , against laws requiring segregated seating in buses . Evers admitted he was not a regular patron of the buses . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely to institute litigation , he was in no position to represent Negro bus riders . On appeal the Supreme Court reversed , saying , " That the appellant may have boarded this particular bus for the purpose of instituting this litigation is not significant . " 15 If the trial court 's ruling had been allowed to stand , it would have been used by some district judges to dismiss school-entry suits on the ground that the plaintiffs were merely trying to enroll in " white " schools to institute litigation . 3 ) The complaint should be dismissed because the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified by southern state legislatures acting under duress , and is therefore not part of the Constitution . This contention that the Constitution itself is unconstitutional has been given national prominence by David Lawrence , publisher of the U. S. News and World Report , who has  | aptly been called " the South 's Own Lawyer on the National Scene . " Lawyers for the Orleans Parish School Board ( New Orleans ) and the Tennessee Federation of Constitutional Government , among others , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer is that of course southern legislatures ratified the Fourteenth Amendment unwillingly . It was the price they paid for readmission to full status in the Union . The North won the Civil War ; its victory terms included acceptance by southern legislatures not only of the Fourteenth , but also of the Thirteenth and Fifteenth Amendments . If southern states had had a free choice , they would not have ratified any of these amendments . At this late date judges can scarcely be persuaded to hold the Fourteenth Amendment unconstitutional . This Amendment not only protects Negroes against governmental-imposed discrimination , but it is the primary constitutional limitation on state regulation of speech , press , and religion . All the judges have disposed of the matter by pointing out that Congress determines the validity of the ratification of constitutional amendments ; it has never been thought to be within the jurisdiction of courts . 4 ) The case should be dismissed because a single judge is without jurisdiction to enjoin the enforcement of state laws . Because of the seriousness of declaring a state law unconstitutional , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear motions for injunctions against the enforcement of state statutes . Furthermore , decisions of these three-judge courts are directly appellable to the Supreme Court . Sometimes it is to the advantage of the Negro plaintiffs to secure such a  | court because it leads to faster Supreme Court review , but most of the time it has been the school boards who have challenged a single judge 's jurisdiction to hear a case . Long-established precedents make it clear that if state laws are clearly and obviously constitutional , a three-judge court need not be assembled . Otherwise , no matter how frivolous the challenge , a plaintiff would be able to demand a three-judge court and circumvent the normal channels of review . What of the converse situation , where the statute is obviously unconstitutional ? Until the school-segregation controversy the question had never been raised . It is one of the operating assumptions of our federal system that no state law is obviously unconstitutional . State legislatures are supposedly cognizant of their constitutional obligation and it is not to be thought they would pass laws clearly unconstitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take advantage of this presumption by passing dozens of laws clearly in conflict with the Constitution . In most instances a single judge has felt competent to declare these laws unconstitutional . To play it safe , three-judge courts have been used to test the validity of laws which on their face do not impose segregation but make integration impossibly difficult . Although this delays hearings and ties up judicial manpower , in the long run it may expedite desegregation . Not only are there faster appeals , but three southern judges may find enough reinforcement in collegiate activity to make an unpopular ruling collectively that they might not make separately . School boards usually fail to persuade the judge to dismiss the Negroes ' legal complaint outright . Their next line of defense is to contend that since they have acted in good faith , the judge should refrain from issuing any injunctions . If he feels he must take some kind of action , he should not call for actual desegregation , at least not for a long long time . Under the terms of the Supreme Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a good faith attempt  | to integrate . What does this obligation amount to ? Not much , and they know it . Outside the courtroom many school board members have spoken otherwise . In Houston one board member said " she would go to jail rather than to have desegregation . " Another said " she would not go to jail but she would never vote for any plan of integration . " In New Orleans a former president of the school board promised to close the public schools if necessary to prevent integration . Even moderate school board members have felt it politically necessary to promise their constituents to fight to retain segregation . At the same time public officials are insisting on the public platform that they are doing all they can to resist integration ; they come before the judge insisting they are making a good faith attempt to desegregate . In Virginia , while campaigning for governor on a pledge " to dedicate every capacity to preserve segregation in the schools , " J. Lindsay Almond , as attorney general , was telling the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good faith . In Houston the segregationists ' faction , after strengthening its control over the school board in the fall of 1956 , proceeded to reverse the tentative good faith steps previously taken . Then they went before Judge Ben C. Connally and cited as evidence of their good faith the very steps which they had just repudiated . Fortunately for the school authorities , judges have refused to take judicial notice of comments of individual members or remarks made in public speeches . So long as a board avoids spreading statements of outright defiance across its official minutes , its lack of good faith will probably not be made grounds for an injunction . In short , the requirement of good faith has come to mean only that officials have thought seriously about the problem , have authorized studies to be made , and have always acted with the students ' welfare in mind ? a kind of character judgment rather than a legally enforceable obligation . Judge Joe E. Estes felt that  | Mansfield , Texas , officials had shown good faith , for example , despite their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they had opened their meetings with prayer , studied articles in magazines , held numerous meetings , passed resolutions , and appointed committees The only boards called to task for an " attitude of intransigency " are those in Virginia , where until 1958 state laws made it obligatory for boards to show " bad faith . " But as the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has stated : " Faith by itself . . . without works , is not enough . " Even if a board is acting in good faith , what about its obligation to make an immediate start and move with all deliberate speed toward complete desegregation " at the earliest practicable date " ? How can a board contend that it is moving with all deliberate speed when it has done nothing ? The details of the boards ' contentions vary from city to city , but the argument runs something like this : We need more time because in our city problems are more complex than those of other districts ; in Houston because the district has the largest number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County ( Virginia ) because we have such a high ratio of Negroes to whites ; and so on . In New Orleans the board put up an unusually vigorous fight to persuade Judge J. Skelly Wright that their peculiar problems entitled them to retain segregation . Elaborate studies were introduced to prove that integration " would endanger the health and morals of New Orleans ' white children . " " It is only too well known , " said the board , " that a large segment of our Negro population has little or no sense of morality and that to intermingle them with the white children in our public schools could well corrupt the minds and hearts of the white children to their lifelong and perhaps eternal injury . " 22 This , it was contended ,  | made the situation in Orleans parish " substantially different from the facts in the School Segregation cases . " School officials have also contended that since schools are overcrowded , no action to desegregation can be taken until more schools are built . Another argument is this : schools should remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Houston board , for illustration , insisted it was moving with deliberate speed toward desegregation because it had established a summer training program for Negro teachers . Negro plaintiffs have countered that these several arguments are backdoor attempts to reargue the merits of segregation . The Supreme Court has already decided schools should be desegregated . Authorities may assign pupils to schools on the basis of aptitude , provided Negro and white students are treated alike . Thurgood Marshall has said : " I have no objection to academic segregation , only racial segregation . If they want to put all the dumb ones , white and black , into the same school that is fine , provided they put all the smart ones , white and black , into the same school . " Some school authorities contend that schools have already been desegregated , and that therefore no injunction is needed . The fact that all Negroes still attend " colored " schools , it is explained , comes about as a result of voluntary choice and residential location . A pupil-placement program makes such a contention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racial factors are considered in assigning pupils . Despite de facto segregation , the Mecklenburg County Board of Education in North Carolina told the judge in the spring of 1959 that it did not follow a policy of racial discrimination . Frank L. Transcript of Record , pp. 108-113 , and Brief on Behalf of Appellant , October 3 , 1956 , in Civil Action No. 16,190 , before United States Court of Appeals , and Petition for Rehearing and Brief filed March 23 , 1957.  | Fuller , chairman of the Durham ( North Carolina ) board , outside of the courtroom told a delegation of Negroes he did not believe Durham was ready for desegregation , but in court his board denied it assigned children to schools on the basis of race . Eventually the Durham board transferred a few Negroes to " white " schools . A Georgia state law forbids desegregation , yet the Atlanta School Board objected when Judge Frank A. Hooper said he " assumed " Atlanta schools were segregated . The board insisted it was not pursuing a policy of racial discrimination . Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Georgia also tried to argue , despite the fact that the university had been segregated for the entire 175 years of its existence , that it was not pursuing a policy of segregation when it denied admission to Hamilton E. Holmes and Charlayne Hunter , two honor students , who applied for admission to the university in June 1959 . For a year officials delayed processing their applications . Then under threat of a lawsuit , a preregistration interview was held . Holmes was asked whether he had taken part in sit-in demonstrations , visited houses of prostitution , frequented beatnik joints , been to interracial parties , or been arrested . He answered " no " to all these questions . But his application was rejected by university officials because they contended he had been untruthful since they had information he had been arrested for speeding . After Miss Hunter 's interview , the university ruled that she would not be admitted because there was no space in the dormitories , but indicated she might be allowed to attend the university in September 1961 . At a five-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to persuade Judge William A. Bootle that the fact of race had not caused them to reject Holmes 's and Hunter 's applications . Judge Bootle ? a former dean of the Mercer law school , native Georgian , staunch Republican , and a 1954 appointee of President Eisenhower ? on January 6 , 1961 , three  | days before winter-quarter registration , ruled , " Had plaintiffs been white applicants to the University of Georgia both would have been admitted to the university not later than the beginning of the fall quarter , 1960 . " When the arguments are over , and the judge returns to his chambers and takes off his robe , the decision is up to him . He has read the Supreme Court 's opinions , studied the briefs , listened to the arguments of both sides . He weighs the arguments . He assesses the political factors of life , those factors which are not mentioned but are very much a part of the decision-making process . What are the judge 's choices ? He can : 1 . Dismiss the complaint . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the complaint on its merits and send Negroes elsewhere to seek relief . 3 . Order school authorities " from and after such time as may be necessary to make arrangements for admission of children to such schools on a racially nondiscriminatory basis with all deliberate speed , " but specify no date or set a date in the far future . 4 . Order school authorities to come forward by a specified date with a plan at which time there will be further hearings to determine if it meets the minimum requirements as outlined in the Brown decisions . 5 . Order school authorities to admit on a certain date certain named Negro pupils to certain named schools . 6 . Order authorities to begin desegregation by a certain date , doing so by stages . 7 . Order school authorities to admit all Negroes to public schools on the same terms as other pupils . With exceptions , in the border states federal judges have held school authorities to a strict accounting ; they have called for the immediate integration of schools or have forced authorities to come forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , Judge Paul Leahy required state educational authorities to force reluctant districts in the southern part of the state to desegregate , thus avoiding the necessity of a suit against each and every school board . Again , despite the fact that Hopkins County ( Kentucky ) officials were acting in good faith , Judge Henry L. Brooks rejected a proposal to stretch desegregation over a twelve-year period , disapproved a second plan to do it in four years , and ordered complete desegregation within a year . The judges operating in the border states have not tolerated plans subjecting Negro students to admission tests or standards not being required of white students , not even during a transitional phase . In the South itself the judges have ordered very little desegregation . A few have even dismissed the Negroes ' complaints . In Miami , Judge Emett C. Choate ruled that Negroes , by asking for an integration injunction rather than asking for assignment to particular schools , had failed to present a valid complaint ; in Dallas , Judge Atwell ruled the suit had been started prematurely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; even so the second time around the district judges dismissed the complaints again . In other cases , for example in Birmingham , in all the North Carolina cases , and in Dollarway , Arkansas , judges retained jurisdiction but refused to deal with the complaints on their merits and sent Negroes back to the school boards in order to exhaust their administrative remedies . By this means , a judge avoids further action for a year or so . Some judges have been a bit bolder : In Houston , in New Orleans , in Clarendon County and Prince Edward County , Virginia , and eventually in Dallas , the judges ordered school authorities to cease segregating Negroes " from and after such time as may be necessary " to make arrangements . But the judges carefully avoided specifying any date . They reiterated the Brown decision , making it apply specifically to the district in question . School  | authorities are subject to possible punishment for violating these injunctions , but the obligation imposed is so vague , the chance of their being punished without future action so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these " from and after " injunctions is a major victory for the board . It took the Dallas plaintiffs two years , three district court hearings , and three interventions by the court of appeals even to secure one of these mild and almost meaningless " from and after " injunctions . After the court of appeals told Judge Atwell he should not have peremptorily dismissed the complaint , he held another hearing . In a decision outspokenly critical of the Supreme Court and in favor of the right of white students to remain segregated from Negroes , Atwell again refused to order the Dallas board to take any action . The school board , he insisted , had the right to determine when schools should be integrated . He would not interfere . Again the court of appeals reversed . Finally in September 1957 , two years after the Negroes had first come to his court , Atwell , in what can only be described as a fit of pique , ordered Dallas to desegregate all its schools and to do so by the beginning of the second semester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board an opportunity to present its own plan , was so obviously uncalled for that many observers speculated that Atwell had issued it in the expectation it would be reversed . At any rate , Andrew J. Thuss , lawyer for the Dallas board , secured an early hearing from the court of appeals , where he told the judges ( R. T. Rives , J. R. Brown , and W. L. Jones ) : " Judge Atwell just came in and said he wanted his judgment . . . . It did n't take but a few minutes . " The circuit judges were disturbed by Atwell 's failure to give the board a chance to present a plan for gradual desegregation . On the other hand , they were equally disturbed by the board 's failure to take any initiative . Judge Brown told Thuss , " You 've taken two years and you 're not a step further . " Judge Jones tried to get a commitment from Thuss : " When do you expect to present a plan ? "  | Said Thuss , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you think deliberate speed means in regard to this situation ? " Thuss smiled The court of appeals vacated Atwell 's injunction , and taking a somewhat unusual step itself issued a " from and after " undated injunction . School boards have demonstrated no greater willingness to initiate desegregation action under these undated injunctions than they have under the Brown decision itself . Even after a " from and after " injunction has been issued , schools have remained segregated until Negroes again return to court . Despite its reputation of being an extremist organization , the NAACP made no attempt to force the Dallas board to comply with the injunction until the summer of 1959 , four years after filing the first complaint and two years after the " from and after " injunction was issued . They merely asked the judge to make the school board come up with a plan . By this fourth go-round , Judge Atwell had fully retired , so the Dallas suit was assigned to Atwell 's younger colleague , Judge T. Whitfield Davidson , age eighty-two , who was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a judge under eighty . Davidson , who studied law at Columbia University and the University of Chicago before the turn of the century , was admitted to the bar in 1903 . He practiced in East Texas , was active in Democratic circles , served as a state senator and  | lieutenant governor , and was appointed to the bench in 1932 . Davidson had said he was ready to retire in 1954 , provided " the powers that be " would " accept a judge , a man who had voted for Eisenhower , if such was required , that had the endorsement of the Abilene and Fort Worth Bars , " but in 1959 he was still hearing non-jury cases . When the Dallas case was heard for the fourth time , Dr. W. T. White , superintendent of schools , testified that the authorities were acting in good faith with all deliberate speed and cited as evidence the fact that the board was studying the problems . Schools were overcrowded , he said ; Negro students had lower aptitudes than white students , and many white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Dr. White , the problems were so overwhelming that it would take Dallas twenty to twenty-five years to desegregate . Thurgood Marshall had come down from New York to join C. B. Bunkley , Jr. , the local NAACP lawyer and one of the best , to see if they could not get the Dallas suit off the ground . Marshall and Bunkley insisted that Dallas was merely going through " tongue-in-cheek steps . " The board could integrate if it wanted to , at least it could start , but obviously it had no intention of ever doing so unless Judge Davidson insisted upon it . At the conclusion of the hearing Judge Davidson delivered a lecture to the Negroes in his courtroom . " I have had dealings with Negroes all my life , " he told them . " I received my first nourishment from a Negro woman 's breast . There is no animosity , no hatred of any kind in my heart . The southern white gentleman does not feel unkindly toward the Negro . " He loved the Old South tradition , he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he the Negro begins imitating his white brother he is not at his best . If you want to rise in life , there is a way . . . . That is to excel . " Following additional remarks about the virtues of patience and Christian charity , Judge Davidson said : " The Supreme Court has placed your state , your country , and your  | schools . . . to use a street term . . . over the barrel . . . . You are going to integrate your schools . The question is when . " However , he continued , Negroes should recognize " that the white man has a right to maintain his racial integrity and it ca n't be done so easily in integrated schools . . . We will not name any date or issue any order . . . . The School Board should further study this question and perhaps take further action , maybe an election . " Thurgood Marshall threw his pencil on the table with a look of strong disappointment . Nor was he comforted by the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Five years after the original complaint , six years after the Brown decision , the Dallas Independent School District was as segregated as ever . For the fifth time the NAACP was forced to go to the court of appeals in New Orleans . This time , February 1960 , the panel consisted of Chief Judge Rives , Judge John Minor Wisdom , and Judge Benjamin F. Cameron . The NAACP could expect no more from Cameron than they had been able to get from Atwell or Davidson , but it was obvious that Rives and Wisdom were losing patience with Dallas . Dallas was represented by R. H. Brin , Jr . Rives and Wisdom gave him a rough time . At one point , when Brin commented , " I am not sure what the Negro plaintiffs want , " Chief Judge Rives interrupted : " Everybody knows what they want . They want desegregation as soon as they can get it . . . . We 've been engaging in legal literature for five years without action . . . . Actually the first step has not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet come forward with a desegregation plan . Do you think that a mere study over a period of five years is a prompt and immediate start as ordered by the Supreme Court ? " Brin responded : " The Board fully recognizes its duties . The study can not be indefinite . " Rives : " You have been telling us that all along . " Judge Wisdom entered the discussion , pointing out that the board kept saying it recognized its obligations under the Brown  | decision , but still it had done nothing . " Do n't you think , " he asked , " the school board should come up with a plan without a court order ? " Brin did not answer . Clearly what the board needed was a court command to present a plan . Clearly , it would not present such a plan unless such an order was issued . C. B. Bunkley , Jr. , speaking for the plaintiffs , told the court of appeals : " A gradual stair-step integration plan would be workable and acceptable to us . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want a start by September . " The court of appeals ( March 1960 ) , with Judge Cameron dissenting , ordered Dallas to present a desegregation plan to Judge Davidson and to do it soon . The court of appeals ' mandate was unequivocal : it would be hard for either the school authorities or even Judge Davidson to ignore it . Late in May Davidson once again called his court to order . Once again the clerk called the Dallas case from the docket ? still known as Borders v. Rippy though by this time Borders and most of the Negro plaintiffs in whose behalf the suit had been first instituted had graduated and Rippy had retired as chairman of the school board . Harry W. Strasburger , attorney for the board , came forward to present Dallas 's desegregation plan : nothing would be done until September 1961 , but then the first grade would be desegregated . Thereafter , another grade would be desegregated each year . Attorneys for the NAACP , though preferring to see Dallas move at a faster pace , did not object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dallas did not offer much . Yet , after all these years and hearings , Dallas did promise to begin . Would Judge Davidson accept the Dallas plan ? Six years after the Supreme Court 's original decision , Dallas proposed to delay for another year and then to take until 1973 to complete desegregation . Everybody knew how Davidson felt ; he was expected to rule that the Dallas plan was adequate .  | Judge Davidson rejected Dallas 's proposals ? not because the school board was moving too slowly , but because it was moving too rapidly . He became the first , and so far the only , judge to reject a proposed desegregation program on the ground it was too sweeping . For over two hours Davidson held forth . " The Dallas Plan , " he later reiterated , " would lead , in the opinion and the light of history and unquestionable sources to an amalgamation of the races . . . . In no clime and in no nation have the races ever amalgamated that it has not been to the disadvantage of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the halls of Congress were shot up , they were not from Negroes that were raised in the South . They were from the integrated people of Puerto Rico . " After further recitation , Judge Davidson instructed Dallas to set aside its own plans and substitute a program , to begin in September 1961 , of " voluntary preference , " or what is known in Dallas as " salt and pepper . " Under the Davidson plan ( which he adopted from a program long urged by the Dallas Morning News ) all the schools in Dallas would remain segregated for the indefinite future , except for a school or two which the board was told to set aside for those students desiring to attend integrated institutions . " Let those integration advocates of both races have their children transferred there , " said Davidson . " If that school succeeded , then the entire town could be integrated by consent . " Thurgood Marshall , who has made a practice of attending these Dallas hearings , was bewildered . So was Attorney Strasburger . Said Marshall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . let me out of here . " Said Strasburger , " The board prefers its graduate-a-year system , but it will as ordered submit a voluntary ' program . " During the summer of 1960 Dallas held a referendum to determine if its citizens would support desegregation , for under Texas law a city is not supposed to abandon segregation without prior favorable public vote . Such a referendum has no relation  | to Dallas 's constitutional obligation to desegregate its schools , but Judge Davidson was anxious for it to be held . He did his part to guarantee that the voters would reject integration . On the eve of the election he announced that if the vote were favorable to desegregation , he would order " immediate wholesale integration . " Judge Davidson 's plan for Dallas went before the court of appeals . For the sixth time the court of appeals reversed the district judge . Circuit Judges Rives , Tuttle , and Jones refused to take charge of the Dallas case , although they agreed that the NAACP 's request that they do so had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustrating history of this litigation . " The circuit judges , however , directed Davidson to approve the stairstep plan presented by the Dallas board , but to eliminate a transfer provision which introduced racial factors . Yet despite the unequivocal mandate to Davidson , as long as he retains jurisdiction over the Dallas suit , it is difficult to predict what will happen . The Houston case has been handled by Judge Ben C. Connally . The son of former Senator Tom Connally , a 1949 Truman appointee when he was 39 , Judge Connally , more than any other judge , worked behind the scenes and outside the courtroom in an attempt to work out a compromise . At the outset of the Houston suit in December 1956 , he persuaded the plaintiffs to withdraw their motion for a temporary injunction in exchange for an agreement that their suit would be scheduled for a comprehensive hearing on a permanent injunction in the spring of 1957 , still plenty of time , it was thought , before schools opened in September . After an extended hearing , Connally called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the board ) into his chambers for a secret meeting in which he tried to persuade the  | board to come up with a plan , something acceptable to the board and something " plaintiff 's lawyer could sell to his people . " The board refused to do so . Connally took the case under advisement . Three months later schools opened . Judge Connally still had not handed down his ruling . Sometimes he woke up in the middle of the night and pondered the school integration case , but it was not until October 16 , a good month after school started , that he made his ruling public . It did no more than to tell the board it should desegregate with all deliberate speed . For two years the Houston School Board ? one of the few large city boards which has faction on the board had been strengthened and the board prepared to resist desegregation even more determinedly . In the summer of 1959 the plaintiffs asked for another hearing , telling Judge Connally that the board had ignored his earlier order to proceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September 1959 . The board responded by submitting a 100,000-word report saying that problems of housing , academic achievement , and finances made it impossible for them to present a desegregation program and that they were already doing all that could reasonably be expected . Judge Connally , holding back his ruling until after schools opened , in the fall of 1959 told the Houston board to report on progress by the following summer . Still he did not instruct the board that it must begin with desegregation , although he made it clear that he expected some action . In the spring of 1960 , after the court of appeals in the Dallas suit had indicated its displeasure with the way Davidson had handled that suit , Judge Connally sent the Houston board a letter to the effect that he expected it to file a desegregation plan by June 1 . Connally warned unless it did so he had no alternative " but to grant the relief which the plaintiffs have sought " by  | ordering the immediate abolishment of segregation . Judge Connally was losing patience . He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fall , desegregation would begin . During the summer the Houston board held a public referendum , ostensibly to comply with a state law requiring approval of district patrons or else withdrawal of state funds . Prior to the referendum ( which went against integration by a large majority ) Stone Wells , a member of the Houston board , announced : " The people should know that the areas which want desegration first are going to get it . And the ones that vote for it are going to get it first . That 's what this election is for . " This was too much for Connally . He publicly rebuked Wells by releasing a letter he wrote to Joe H. Reynolds , attorney for the board : " Your clients must recognize , " the judge wrote , " that this is not a popularity contest , but is the performance of a duty which the law imposes . In our many conferences and hearings , I have always been led to believe that some plan adopted by other Texas cities , and which experience has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nonetheless when the deadline came all the Houston board did was submit to Connally a " salt-and-pepper " plan similar to the one the Dallas board a few days before had prepared at the request of Judge Davidson . But Judge Connally is no Davidson . The Houston plan " does not constitute compliance . . . nor does it constitute a good faith attempt at compliance ; but is a palpable sham and subterfuge designed only to accomplish further evasion and delay . " Since the Houston board refused to present an acceptable plan , Judge Connally himself ordered Houston to desegregate its first  | grade in September 1960 , progressively including another grade each year . Stone Wells commented : " Judge Davidson in Dallas recommended the very same plan that we as a board submitted to the judge here . Apparently federal judges differ quite a bit on their outlook on plans . " The court of appeals refused to stay Judge Connally 's order . September was fast approaching . The Houston board searched for an out . They tried to construe Judge Connally 's order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge Connally checked this move by clarifying his order . Then the board adopted new standards for admission to the first grade in order to reduce the number of Negroes eligible to attend integrated institutions . However , they could not design standards which would keep all Negroes out of desegregated first grades without running afoul of Judge Connally . Governor Price Daniel refused to interfere , and the Houston board lost their last excuse for delay when Texas Attorney General Will Wilson ruled that the Texas law depriving school districts of state funds if they desegregated without a favorable vote of their patrons did not apply when integration resulted from a court order . ( Wilson 's ruling also stripped Dallas of any further excuse . ) With the last avenue of escape cut off , the Houston School Board , the Houston mayor , and the local newspapers became last-minute moderates and urged compliance . The most defiant sounds came from the school board , which delayed the transfer . But two weeks after schools started eleven six-year-old Negro children started to study their ABC 's in " white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest completely segregated school district . The New Orleans case has been handled by Judge J. Skelly Wright , a native of New Orleans . Wright , a Democrat , slight of  | stature and decisive in action , taught for two years after graduating from Loyola University Law School in 1933 . After service as United States attorney and war duty , in 1948 he was named United States attorney in New Orleans and a year later at thirtyeight was appointed to the bench by President Truman . At first Judge Wright issued a meaningless " from and after " injunction . Since then he has been much less willing to tolerate delay than his fellow judges sitting in Texas . The New Orleans suit too has been a long-drawn-out affair , but less because of the judge than because of the lack of aggressive pressing of the case by the Negro plaintiffs and intense resistance by the school board . Judge Wright 's opinions and public comments , unlike those of Atwell and Davidson , have given little comfort to confirmed segregationists . For example , he concluded his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all deliberate speed by saying , " We are , all of us , free-born Americans , with a right to make our way , unfettered by sanctions imposed by man because of the work of God " - perhaps the most cogent and brief argument against segregation penned in the entire controversy . Even though Wright 's first injunction required New Orleans to do nothing , at least for a while , the school board appealed all the way up the judicial hierarchy . Except to consume time , this maneuver accomplished little . Until the fall of 1960 the lawyers for the board kept up a running fire of motions asking Wright to set aside the injunction , each time for some new and ingenious reason ? once because it was claimed that the plaintiffs had not proved they were in fact Negroes . Judge Wright denied all these motions . The New Orleans board persisted in its refusal to initiate desegregation , but the plaintiffs waited for almost three years before returning to court . Then in the summer of 1959 they asked Judge Wright to put some teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a brief hearing , he told the Orleans Parish School Board that " all deliberate speed " in their case had already  | run to six years and he ordered them to present a plan by May 1960 , suggesting they start with the first grade . Again the board appealed unsuccessfully . Again they tried to persuade Wright to vacate his order . May came and the board still had no plan . The board complained it could not produce a plan because of restrictive state laws . To take the board off the spot the judge himself put forth a token desegregation plan . He ordered the board to integrate the first grade in September 1960 . Certainly the New Orleans School Board had done all it could to delay desegregation . No other board had fought harder or longer . By the summer of 1960 , however , all except one of the board members recognized that their legal battles were over . Judge Wright 's order would stick . They prepared to comply . But would the state let them ? To that phase of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from and after " injunctions do force authorities to desegregate . Other judges have moved the proceedings along more swiftly by setting in their original injunctions a fixed date for the submission of a plan . This is what Judge Frank A. Hooper did in Atlanta , Judge William E. Miller in Nashville , Judge Robert L. Taylor in Knoxville , and Judge John E. Miller in Little Rock . These judges gave the boards plenty of time , but their decrees had more meaning than those in which the courts failed to set a target date . The setting of a date forces the community to face its alternatives ; it clarifies the choices , and offers earlier action . Most of the judges have refused to order the admission of certain students to particular schools on the ground that the assignment of pupils is the duty of the school board and not of the courts . The judge 's task is to see to it that the board desegregates , not to tell the board how it should be done . However , in Norfolk , after school authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students requesting a transfer , Judge Walter Hoffman , not a man to be lightly trifled with , gave the board four days to reconsider . He told them it was all right if they  | wished to make Negro pupils take tests and submit to oral interviews ; however , he warned them that they could not refuse a transfer merely because they felt it would be bad for Negro students to attend " white " schools . The board then approved the request of fourteen students , but later rescinded its action in the face of a state court injunction and pressure from state officials . At this juncture Judge Hoffman himself ordered the fourteen students admitted . Similarly , Judge Wright in New Orleans and Judge Connally in Houston themselves had instituted twelve-year desegregation plans beginning with the first grade when school officials in those cities refused to come forward with their own programs . And then there is always the unforgettable action of Judge Davidson in insisting on his own salt-and-pepper program for Dallas . The most drastic action a judge can take is to order the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the same terms as other students . This has been done only in a few instances ? Clinton , Tennessee ; Mansfield , Texas ; and in some of the Virginia districts at the high school level where the board maintained no high schools at all for Negroes , or where the state 's massive resistance laws left no opportunity for local boards to submit desegregation programs . In each instance the judge made it perfectly clear that if the authorities presented a desegregation schedule , the court would gladly modify the injunction to allow for a more gradual approach . Judge John Paul 's handling of the Warren County , Virginia , suit illustrates how federal judges may , if they are so minded , see to it that the issues are quickly litigated and decisions swiftly made . On August 29 , 1958 , twenty-six Negro students via NAACP counsel filed a complaint telling Judge Paul that Negroes were not allowed to attend the only high school operated in the county but instead were transported to a " colored " school in an adjoining county . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Negroes . He postponed , but only for a week , the effective date of his order to permit the board to seek a stay of his injunction from the Court of Appeals  | for the Fourth Circuit . Four days later Virginia 's Attorney General A. S. Harrison , Jr. , went to Baltimore to ask Circuit Judge Sobeloff for a stay of Paul 's order . Judge Sobeloff denied the request . In all , it took two weeks between complaint and an enforceable injunction . It can be done if the judge wants to do it . Since most of the legal battles have been concerned with when a district should start to desegregate , there has been less consideration of how it should be done . School authorities have the duty of determining the details of integration procedures . Judges have consistently refused to do so . But if authorities fail to come up with an acceptable program , in time the judge may order the immediate integration of all the schools or at least some of the grades . If school boards come up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost anything submitted . Nashville , New Orleans , Houston , and Knoxville were permitted to begin with the first grade and take twelve years to desegregate , one grade a year . Little Rock was allowed to postpone action for two years , and then start with the selected admission of a few Negroes to one high school , taking six years to complete integration . Judges have allowed , even encouraged , school boards to change attendance districts , to urge white parents who object to having their children attend desegregated schools to transfer their children from these schools , or to screen Negroes assigned to desegregated schools . In Atlanta a plan has been approved which is about as minimal as it could possibly be . The key man in the Atlanta suit is Judge Frank A. Hooper . Judge Hooper is a native Georgian , born in 1895 , who before his appointment to the federal bench in 1949 was a judge of the Georgia Court of Appeals , a member of the Georgia legislature , and an active supporter of Senator Richard Russell . That a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a very daring inference . But he is a judge . Prior to the actual hearing of the case , Judge Hooper announced : " Even the most ardent segregationists . . . now recognize that racially segregated public schools are not permitted by the law . . . . This court can not at this time make any other ruling except a ruling to the effect that the operation of racially segregated public schools in Atlanta violates the Fourteenth Amendment . . . . To make any other ruling would only add to the confusion which already exists in the minds of so many of our good citizens , and to build up in the breasts of our citizens hopes of escape which would soon be torn into shreds by rulings of our appellate courts on review . " To emphasize that his action was not the caprice of an individual judge , Hooper asked the other district judge assigned to the court , William Boyd Sloan , to sit with him in an advisory capacity . With two native Georgians hearing the case it was hoped that Atlantans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segregation or desegregation , but only as to method and time . Suggesting he would approve a plan for " token integration , " Hooper ordered Atlanta to present a program by December 1 , 1959 . Actually Atlanta officials were ready if not willing to do so , but under Georgia law , until 1961 , if any Negro were admitted to a " white " school all schools in the district would have been automatically closed . The mayor and school authorities in Atlanta accepted Hooper 's edict ; the governor and rural Georgians at first insisted on an appeal , but when they discovered an appeal would put the matter into the hands of circuit judges , they changed their minds . The Atlanta School Board filed its plan . It called for the use of a pupil-placement law , but just for the senior year of high school , then moving down one grade every year . In other words , for the first year of the desegregation program Negroes in the twelfth grade could ask for a transfer to " white " schools . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This plan was acceptable to Judge Hooper . At first he re- frained from placing any definite date for Atlanta to inaugurate its program in order to give the Georgia legislature an opportunity to enact local option legislation . The 1960 session of the Georgia legislature failed to take any action other than to appoint a commission to survey Georgia opinion . Thereafter Judge Hooper announced that he would give the legislature just one more year . Whatever they decided , Atlanta must begin its program in September 1961 . ( In 1961 as a result of the University of Georgia case , the legislature finally adopted a local option plan . ) About the only proposed desegregation plan which judges , always excepting Judge Davidson , have rejected , is the voluntary choice , parents ' preference , or " salt-and-pepper " plan . In essence these schemes call for the establishment of three kinds of schools : integrated schools , schools for Negroes , and schools for whites . Students are to be assigned in accord with preferences expressed by their parents in a yearly census . Proponents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Court does not require integration , it merely forbids discrimination , and that " no violation of the Constitution is involved even though the children of different races voluntarily attend different schools , as they attend different churches . " Judge Parker pointed out , however , that a state may not deny a Negro on account of race the right to attend any school it maintains . Voluntary segregation is permissible only so long as there is no requirement of authorities to that effect . But under parents ' preference schemes , there would be schools from which Negroes by law would be excluded . A board may encourage transfers and allow students to go where they wish . Perhaps this would result in segregation . A board may even ask parents for their preferences , but it may not refuse to admit a student to a school because of his race . It is for these reasons that Judge William E. Miller held such a program tendered by Nashville authorities " to be unconstitutional on its face . " Six months later the Nashville board , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varying only in its details from the one he previously rejected . Again he refused to allow Nashville to use it . What has been the impact of over two hundred judicial hearings and six years of litigation ? Desegregation has been hastened in the border states . By the end of 1960 Atlanta , Chattanooga , Knoxville , and Galveston had been forced to come up with programs . In Miami authorities under court compulsion had introduced token integration as had those of Little Rock , New Orleans , Clinton , Nashville , Houston , and in several cities in Virginia . A few North Carolina schools had admitted a few Negroes to " white " schools in order to forestall court-compelled integration . Yet no Negro had been admitted to a North Carolina school because of a court order . In Arkansas some cities desegregated when legal action was threatened . The formal position of the judges is that the attitude of the community toward desegregation is irrelevant . A board , and the judge , is supposed to act promptly and completely " uninfluenced by private and public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit said : " The fact that the schools might be closed if the order to desegregate were enforced is no reason for not enforcing it . " Any doubt about the legal rules was put to rest by the Supreme Court : in 1959 in its Little Rock case it held opposition in a community , even violence , does not justify a board in refusing to desegregate the schools under its jurisdiction or authorize a judge to refuse an injunction . But federal judges do not live in a vacuum . Whatever the formal doctrine may be , community attitudes have been a crucial if unmentionable factor . The administrative obstacles to desegregation are no more difficult to overcome in the Deep South than in the border states , but " the earliest practicable date " has been defined differently in the two regions . The judges ' awareness of the unmentionable but nevertheless important factor of local opinion , combined with the NAACP 's disinclination to push proceedings in areas of maximum resistance , makes it likely that judicial ac- tion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judges will grasp at technicalities to postpone desegregation elsewhere . Even within the big-city South there are patterns : the federal judges operating in Texas , Florida , and Arkansas are more inclined to " injunction-dragging " than those in Louisiana , Virginia , and Tennessee . There are exceptions to this generalization . For example , in Louisiana Judge Ben C. Dawkins , Jr. , is among the more ardent segregationists serving on the federal bench . Dawkins , though a Democrat , was appointed to the bench in 1953 to succeed his father , who had held the post since 1924 . He holds court in Shreveport in northern Louisiana , right in the midst of the strongest segregation area of the state . He is the judge who not only refused to interfere when white citizens councils manipulated the law with the help of Monroe City officials to disfranchise 2500 Negro voters , but accused the Negro plaintiff of " bad faith . . . sheer stubborn vindictiveness . " The court of appeals reversed , telling Dawkins : " It is no sign of his bad faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seek to redress this wrong in court . " Dawkins also , at the request of the Louisiana attorney general , enjoined the United States Commission on Civil Rights from holding hearings into alleged voting discrimination in Shreveport . He admitted his order might be upset , but he said , " It is all part of the game . " It is not surprising that Negroes have decided not to press the Shreveport school case , which will be heard by Judge Dawkins , but to concentrate on the New Orleans case where not only is the white moderate faction stronger , but where a less committed judge is handling the legal aspects . The refusal of some of the district judges to clamp down on recalcitrant boards has had a cumulatively adverse impact on the other judges . When one judge in one district sanctions the continued operation of segregated schools , his action intensifies the pressures on other judges to do the same . The judge least willing to act serves as a drag , setting limits to how far other judges are willing to get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along . Federal judges forced authorities to produce plans , looked at them with a critical eye , and issued meaningful injunctions . Then the segregation reaction set in . The failure of some federal judges to crack down on Dallas and Houston , and for a time on Virginia , caused a noticeable softening of judicial action all along the line . When Little Rock secured a strong prosegregation decision from Judge Lemley in the summer of 1958 , judicial action was brought to a complete halt until the Supreme Court reversed . Then there was a moderate reaction . And as the general tides of public opinion have altered , judicial decrees have responded to these political developments . The external pressures have also had their impact on the judges ' articulated premises . In 1955 few informed observers would have thought that the federal judges would permit a school board to do nothing for six years . But in Dallas , Houston , and New Orleans judges construed " all deliberate speed " to mean that a school district may take six years or longer . In Atlanta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the judge gave the board two more years before it had to start to desegregate . In 1955 few observers would have thought that federal judges would construe the Supreme Court 's opinions in such a fashion as to permit a school to retain segregation provided it admitted a few Negroes to a few " white " schools . Nor would they have predicted that a school could so stretch out the program of desegregation so that " at the earliest practicable " date has come to mean the next generation . But the scoreboard must be balanced : judges may not have required much action ; still they are the only ones to require any action . Judges have done something , certainly more than the Congress , the President , the state legislatures . Whatever desegregation there has been has come about because a judge has insisted on it . Judges have allowed school authorities to evade and to delay , but at least they have insisted that total segregation must be abandoned eventually .  | When segregationists call upon all decent men to resist , they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " lawful resistance . " Senator W. M. Rainach , former Chairman of the Louisiana Legislative Committee on Segregation , has said : " We want to provide an incentive in case public school officials decide they want to defy a federal court order to integrate . " 1 Those holding high office , as well as low , have been notably unwilling to condemn public disturbers of the peace . Governor Shivers of Texas described the crowds massed in front of Mansfield High School , calling for the blood of Negro students and preventing the execution of a federal injunction , as " Texas citizens who are making orderly protest against a situation instigated and agitated by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People . " 2 And Garland B. Porter , the segregationist editor of Southern Advertising and Publishing , objected to the fact that northern newspapers referred to the demonstrators in front of Central High in Little Rock as a " mob . " Admitting they had " roughed up a bit " some northern reporters , Porter nevertheless wrote : " The fact is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mob are parents and Americans and Christians with standards of life and conduct just as high as the reporters who were there to seek the truth . " 3 In a similar fashion Van Buren , Arkansas 's Chief of Police Voll Russell referred to the fifty-five white students who cursed their superintendent , their principal , and school officials and threw up picket lines to keep Negro students from entering school as " orderly demonstrators . " " The strike , " he said , " was no more a crime than the Boston Tea Party . " 4 Violence is not new to the southern scene . Nor is racial conflict an exclusively southern phenomenon , as a glance at any northern newspaper will readily demonstrate ? there have been more race riots in northern than in southern cities . Although since 1954 Negroes have been the target of bombs , beatings , and economic harassment , except in Mississippi , there have been no murders or lynchings . And despite the mob scenes there have been no head-on clashes . Violence is there but it is under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Economic reprisals , social ostracism , even physical violence ? the southern version of McCarthyism , as eleven prominent southern clergymen termed it ? have been the fate of those dissenting from the segregationist line , especially in the small towns . Most of these terror campaigns are organized sub rosa , though Roy Harris , for one , openly urged his supporters to make miserable the lives of Atlanta 's moderates . He got a dose of his own medicine ? Hamilton Locky , a former legislator , rang Harris 's phone at 5:00 A.M. after Locky had been awakened by a call from a Harris Iieutenant.5 With minor exceptions the violence and the campaigns of harassment have been in one direction . No white councilman 's home has been bombed , no white street agitator has been at- tacked , no outspoken segregationists have been harassed . No doubt in part the reason is fear . It is also because Negro leaders , men like the Reverend Martin Luther King , have stressed passive resistance . When the president of the NAACP chapter in Union County , North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Roy Wilkins , executive secretary of the national NAACP , immediately suspended him from office . How long Negro leaders will be able to restrain the lawless element among their own people in the face of the provocation of lawless whites no one knows . A Negro in Houston said , as he reflected on the treatment dished out to the nine Negro students attending Little Rock 's Central High , " They had better not try that in Houston . Maybe they can get away with it in Arkansas . But they could n't do that to us ; remember we 're Texans ! " Segregation-minded governors , state legislators , and other officials do not themselves advocate the use of force . But prior to the opening of schools which are preparing to initiate desegregation , many public officials fill the air with dire warnings of trouble . Whatever their opinion of the findings of sociologists as quoted by the Supreme Court , these segregationists are well aware of , and adept practitioners of , the sociologists ' discovery , the self-fulfilling prophecy . The situation becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and defy the courts . Sometimes the actual rioting is allowed to take place without interference as evidence that the predictions were correct . These tactics are not new . Alexander Hamilton ironically commented about officials in western Pennsylvania who stood by while insurgents defied tax collectors . " These officials , " he wrote in 1794 , " are among the loudest in condemning the disorderly conduct of the insurgents . They would agree that it is utterly unjustifiable . . . and of the most dangerous tendency . But they would at the same time , slyly add , that excise laws are pernicious things , very hostile to liberty ( or perhaps smoothly lament that the government had been imprudent enough to pass laws so contrary to the genius of a free people ) , and they would still more cautiously hint that it is enough for those who disapprove of  | such laws to submit to them ? too much to expect their aid in forcing them upon others . " 6 Circuit Judge Warren E. Burger of the United States Court of Appeals for the District @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The desegregation orders have led some reckless and irresponsible men in high places to think they can aid and abet defiance of laws they do not like without seeming to realize that this would encourage others to defy the laws . " 7 A Clinton lawyer put it more forcefully when he accused the southern congressmen of creating the disrespect for law which produced so much trouble in his town : " What the hell do you expect these people to do when they have 90 some odd congressmen from the South signing a piece of paper the Southern Manifesto that says you 're a southern hero if you defy the Supreme Court . " 8 When schools opened in 1954 and 1955 , mobs in a few communities were able to frighten authorities into " postponing " voluntarily inaugurated desegregation programs . In none of these districts were boards of education under specific legal injunction to desegregate . The first such incident was the famous Lucy Case , which hit the headlines in February 1955 . It all started in the summer of 1953 when Miss Autherine Lucy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Alabama graduate school , filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama . The case was handled by the then newly appointed Judge H. Hobart Grooms . In July 1955 Judge Grooms , a tall , fifty-ish , Kentucky-born Republican , ordered the university to admit Mrs. Hudson , Miss Lucy , and all other qualified Negroes to its graduate school . The trustees of the university did not expect Judge Grooms 's order could be set aside , but they appealed anyway . They wanted  | to show the people of Alabama that they were doing all they could to keep the university white . The circuit judges of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit , calling Judge Grooms 's opinion " well considered , " said they were in complete agreement with him . On October 10 , 1955 , the Supreme Court affirmed their decision . The Supreme Court 's action came four days after the deadline for the first semester enrollment , so the university refused to admit the two women for that semester . Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had rejected Mrs. Hudson and Miss Lucy because of late registration , not because of their race . Prior to the second semester Mrs. Hudson was notified she did not meet admission standards because of her " marital record . " There is more than a little doubt that white students were subject to the same rigorous scrutiny , but Mrs. Hudson decided not to confuse the issues so she dropped out of the case . University authorities could find no reason for rejecting Miss Lucy that would not expose them to legal contempt ; they had no choice but to allow her to enroll . To that moment Negroes had been admitted without incident to universities throughout the South . But on February 1 , when Miss Lucy arrived to register , crowds formed and she attended classes under escort of campus police . During this time she was accused of such sordid crimes as flashing a $100 bill to pay her fees and arriving on campus in a Cadillac , though others claimed it was only a Pontiac . University officials did not disperse a constantly growing crowd of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 , to shout and jeer at Miss Lucy as she went to and from classes . Two women deans were dispatched to escort her , but by noon the crowd was an uncontrollable mob . At 1:15 P.M. it was necessary to spirit her away in a highway patrol car . Late that night the board of trustees suspended Autherine Lucy until further notice . This was done , it was explained , for her safety . Pre-law student Leonard Wilson , the rioters ' ring- leader , was expelled , but no further action was taken against the troublemakers . The Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama and its distinguished president , O. C. Carmichael , were caught between the orders of Judge Grooms and the pressures of the segregationists . Whom would they obey ? What should they do ? The board was divided . Some trustees felt they should readmit Miss Lucy and ask the governor to maintain order . Others suggested that Judge Grooms and the Department of Justice be asked for help . Many faculty members and students urged the board to readmit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or segregation but law or mob rule . Days passed . The board did nothing . On February 9 Autherine Lucy , through her attorney , asked Judge Grooms to cite university officials for contempt . She charged that these officials failed to prevent the unauthorized assembly from milling about the campus . In addition , her attorneys made the mistake of accusing the university administration of conspiring with the mob to defy the injunction and of lacking good faith in suspending her from classes . These charges were repeated outside the courtroom to members of the press . Judge Grooms had ample authority to see that his orders were obeyed . Those who ignore court injunctions , whatever the pretext , can be punished for contempt . Or if he felt the trustees had acted in good faith , he could have enjoined the rioters , warning them to stay off the campus or otherwise attempting to keep Miss Lucy from attending classes . If they failed to obey , they could be punished for contempt . Furthermore , Judge Grooms could have called on the Department of Justice for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white-marble post office building was crowded to capacity : there were so many reporters that the judge had to limit the number of seats they could pre-empt . Since they had no evidence to support their charges , at the outset the NAACP attorneys withdrew the accusation that uni- versity authorities had actively conspired with the mob to defy the injunction . The issues were narrowed : did the university 's failure to prevent the riot , or to attempt to prevent it , and its subsequent suspension of Autherine Lucy violate Judge Grooms 's mandate ? John Caddell , Decatur attorney and member of the board of trustees , was called to the stand . He admitted that the board had taken no action to readmit Miss Lucy . He said , " It is a matter of speculation whether , if ever , she will be readmitted . " Marshall pressed his argument : " We have one person acting in a lawful manner , and the other side in an unlawful manner . The law-abiding person was ordered from the campus . That being true , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caddell : " I 'm not at all sure that Autherine Lucy and persons accompanying her were not the very cause of the demonstrations . ... Autherine Lucy came to the campus in a Cadillac automobile , she had a chauffeur Arthur Shores , her attorney , and walked in such a way as to be obnoxious and objectionable and disagreeable . " Marshall : " Is there anyone else on the campus with a Cadillac automobile ? " Caddell : " I do n't know . " University spokesmen told Judge Grooms that they had done what they were supposed to do : admit Autherine Lucy . The university is not a police agency , they contended , and can not be held accountable for public disturbances . Autherine Lucy had been suspended to maintain order and for her own safety . The university had not committed contempt . Judge Grooms quickly made his ruling : university officials had not violated his injunction . On the other hand , he told the university it could not continue to deny Miss Lucy the right to attend classes ; he ordered her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grooms made his ruling , he knew the board  | was going to expell Miss Lucy permanently , ostensibly because of the charges she had made against the university administration.10 That very evening the board did so . Once more she returned to Judge Grooms asking him to cite the board for contempt , arguing that her permanent expulsion violated both his original order against denying Negroes admission to the university and his most recent order calling for her reinstatement . The judge did not agree . Since the board had expelled her for disciplinary and not racial reasons , he held , it had not violated his orders . By this time Miss Lucy was mentally and physically exhausted . She did not appeal the decision , and left the state with the battlefield in the victorious hands of the segregationists . It is possible to construe the actions of Judge Grooms to mean school authorities may expel students , whatever their color , for disciplinary reasons . But few made such refined distinctions . The more obvious conclusion : school authorities ordered by a judge to admit Negroes have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobs protest , authorities may with impunity remove Negro students . It becomes easy to nullify a desegregation injunction . Judge Grooms 's complacence in the face of the challenge of the mob contrasts sharply with his original handling of the Lucy case . His original injunction not only preserved the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs , but by recognizing the action as a class suit reflected a determination to give full effect to the Supreme Court 's desegregation decisions . It has been the last pro-civil rights order Judge Grooms has made . With the Alabama decision , segregationists lost a lawsuit , but won a battle . One who watched the Lucy Affair with more than usual inter- est was Governor Shivers of Texas . Six months later , in the fall of 1956 , he used the Lucy precedent to defy not one , but two federal courts . The first of these cases involved Texarkana Junior College , where authorities came close to being held in contempt . Texarkana Junior College was ordered to cease discriminating against Negroes and specifically to admit two named Negro students . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the president of the college , Dr. W. H. Stilwell , told an audience of protesting citizens that integration would lower educational standards . He said , " It is not only your right but your duty to resist it . " The next day these citizens , including a member of the school 's board of trustees , " did their duty . " 11 They massed in front of the school and shouted " kill the niggers . " Governor Shivers sent Texas Rangers to quell the riot , but the ranger in charge refused to escort the students through the mob.12 An NAACP attorney , the same one who had represented the students in the original proceedings , filed a motion for a contempt citation against the president and trustees . Prior to the hearing , however , agents from the Texas attorney general 's office interrogated the two teen-age students , securing an admission from them that they did not know the lawyer who claimed to represent them . Their parents had instructed the president of the local NAACP to do everything legally possible to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorized the attorney to take the case , but no one had specifically instructed the attorney to file a motion for contempt . For this reason , Federal Judge Joe W. Sheehy dismissed the motion ; Texarkana Junior College 's officials went unpunished ; Texarkana Junior College remained white.13 Trouble erupted also in Mansfield , Texas . Mansfield , fourteen miles from Fort Worth , is a town of 1500 people , including 350 Negroes . Its white citizens were proud of their record for peaceful race relations . But the Negroes were not so satisfied . Until 1954 their only school was a one-room building which lacked  | indoor toilets and running water . The playgrounds were dangerous , and , as many of the Negroes pointed out , " There was not even a flag on the flagpole . " In 1954 a four-room grade school for Negroes was built , but high school students still had to ride public buses into Fort Worth . Although dismissed from school at 3:30 P.M. they could not get a bus back to Mansfield until 5:30 P.M. Not only did they arrive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young teen-agers to remain without supervision in Fort Worth for two hours every afternoon . In April 1955 Negro parents retained an NAACP attorney from Fort Worth . Undoubtedly many of them had no intention of pressing for integration . They just wanted better schools . Despite petitions to the school board they secured no satisfaction . Finally , in October 1955 , the more aggressive among them agreed to sue to force admission of Negroes to Mansfield High . A month later Judge Joe E. Estes , a Fort Worth Republican , appointed to the bench by Eisenhower a few months earlier , dismissed the petition as " premature and precipitate . " In the summer of 1956 the court of appeals reversed Estes , telling him that in the absence of any high school for Negroes , not only was the suit not premature , but Negroes were entitled to admission to Mansfield High when schools opened the next fall . Judge Estes reluctantly issued the necessary order . Here was a valid , final , order of a federal court directing the Mansfield School Board to admit Negroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The town 's only newspaper , taking a straight councilman line , published editorials and letters to the editor charging that the suit was communist-inspired , and the judge 's injunction unconstitutional . The city was flooded with all kinds of antisemitic and other hate literature . Mobs began to form . Many who protested did not contemplate violence . Perhaps most of the people of Mansfield did not approve of mob rule , but they did approve of the cause the mob was championing .  | The situation was quickly out of control . The mayor and the chief of police left town , and extremists took charge . The school board was frightened . Their attorney went to Fort Worth to ask Judge Estes to stay his order . He told the judge that if Negroes tried to enroll there would be trouble , serious trouble . Judge Estes refused to stay his injunction , explaining he had no choice because of the court of appeals ' mandate . When schools opened on August 29 , over two hundred persons were milling about in front of the high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Best Nigger . " Vigilantes stopped cars on the edge of town and escorted out any who might be sympathetic toward integration . The superintendent of schools , R. L. Huffman , told the crowd , " Now you guys know I 'm with you , but I 've got this mandate hanging over my head . " Labor Day intervened , but when schools opened again the crowd was there . Some ministers tried to persuade the people to disperse , to no avail , stimulating an editorial in the local newspaper about " pin-head preachers who preach the brotherhood of man . " There was no violence ? no Negroes appeared to exercise the rights supposedly conferred by Judge Estes ' injunction . At this juncture Governor Shivers sent in the Rangers , ordering them to arrest anyone who " represents a threat to the peace . " He made it clear he meant the Negro students . He instructed local officials to " transfer out of the district any scholastics , white or colored , whose attendance or attempts to attend Mansfield High School would reasonably be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro students . ? " This action , " said Shivers , " would be in line with the U. S. Supreme Court decision in the Lucy Case in Alabama .... Personally I hope that the U. S. Supreme Court will be given an opportunity to view the effect of its desegregation decision on a typical law-abiding Texas community . . . . Should the resulting actions . . . be construed as contempt of the federal courts , I respectfully suggest that the  | charge should be laid against the Governor and not the local people . " The Mansfield Negroes were too terrified to take any further action ? in fact they even withdrew from the NAACP . The federal judge assumed no initiative to defend his injunction , and President Eisenhower , in a press conference a few days later , said Mansfield 's troubles were a local responsibility.16 Shivers said that he had demonstrated that racial controversies could be settled without violence . The credit for pioneering the legal doctrine to support the claim that the need to maintain order excuses officials from obeying desegregation decrees must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida Supreme Court believes in segregation . As one of the Florida jurists explained : " When God created man , he allotted each race to his own continent according to color , Europe to the white man , Asia to the yellow man , Africa to the black man , and America to the red man . " Back in 1949 one Virgil Hawkins , a middle-aged Negro postal carrier , asked the Florida Supreme Court to help him secure admission to the University of Florida Law School . The court refused to do so . Even after the Brown decision the Florida Supreme Court refused . The United States Supreme Court told the Florida Supreme Court three times there was no reason for delay ; still the court refused to act . On what grounds could the Florida Supreme Court justify its refusal to follow the United State 's Supreme Court 's directions ? The Florida jurists conceded that segregation is unconstitutional . But they contended Florida retained the power to maintain order . If Hawkins were to attend the University of Florida there would  | be " violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University system . " Under such circumstances , whatever the Supreme Court of the United States said , they would not mandamus the university to admit Hawkins . Since the Florida Supreme Court was of no help , Hawkins asked the United States Supreme Court itself to issue the needed order . The United States justices refused , telling Hawkins to go to the United States district court for further relief . Hawkins petitioned the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida . This court was presided over by seventy-four-year-old Dozier A. DeVane , about ready to retire . Judge DeVane , a native of Florida , had returned to Florida after serving as solicitor for the Federal Power Commission ; in 1943 he was placed on the federal bench by President Roosevelt . Judge DeVane , a staunch believer in states ' rights , has said that his years on the bench had not " changed to any extent my views as to the rights of the states under the United States Constitution . " Prior to his handling of Hawkins 's case Judge DeVane had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assignment law . The Tallahassee City Council adopted this ordinance after the Supreme Court had ruled that segregated seating on public buses is unconstitutional . This ordinance gives bus drivers authority to tell passengers where to sit : they were not to consider race but such factors as promoting public health , maintaining order , and providing for the proper distribution of weight on the buses . Judge DeVane  | told Negroes challenging this law , clearly designed to circumvent the Supreme Court 's decisions , that they should not destroy the bus system . He urged them to give the problem some " Christian thinking . " This was the judge before whom Hawkins , via his attorney , appeared in January 1958 to ask for an injunction , not only in his own behalf , but for all Negroes being denied the right to attend Florida 's public universities because of their race . Judge DeVane was in no more of a hurry to act than his fellow Floridians serving on the state supreme court . Finally , the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in a terse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving . The court of appeals , indicating its disapproval of his handling of the case , ordered that its own mandate issue forthwith . In June 1958 , more than nine years after Hawkins first went to court , DeVane instructed the University of Florida not to exclude qualified Negroes . But Judge DeVane , showing his reluctance , carefully restricted his order to cover only graduate and graduate professional schools and only at the one institution , the University of Florida.22 Moreover , Judge DeVane 's ruling excluded Hawkins , for he had failed to meet the entrance standards . Finally , Judge DeVane made a point of saying that he recognized the university 's right " to act in emergencies to avoid mischief and to take such normal , reasonable and neces- nary steps as will provide for the orderly and peaceable administration of said University .... " Judge DeVane 's order was an invitation to university officials to use the possibility of disturbances on campus as an excuse for the continued exclusion of Negroes . His mandate was not much stronger than that of the Florida Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Florida decided to litigate no longer . In the fall of 1958 a Negro , but not Hawkins , was admitted to the law school . There were no disturbances , no incidents . Most school boards , after losing their lawsuits , do their best to comply with the ensuing injunctions . The resistance , the refusal to accept the finality of the judge 's instructions , most frequently comes not from the authorities to which the order is directed but from those who are called " strangers " to the proceedings . In 1960 Congress made it a federal crime to conspire by intimidation , organized boycotts , and other illegal means to interfere with a school board attempt to carry out a federal desegregation injunction . Even without such a law federal judges have authority to prevent " strangers " from thwarting the effectiveness of a desegregation plan . A school board attempting to carry out a program of desegregation has a constitutional right to be free from illegal interference . They merely have to petition the judge , and , if he is convinced that certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons to cease and desist . If they refuse to do so , they may be punished for criminal contempt . School authorities and the judge need not stand idly by while segregationists make the Constitution meaningless and render the federal judiciary ineffective . This is the lesson of the Hoxie case . On June 25 , 1955 , the five-man school board of Hoxie , Arkansas , without waiting for the local federal district judge to order it to act , announced it would allow twenty-five Negro  | students to attend classes with one thousand white pupils because " Integration is right in the sight of God , obedience to the Supreme Court . . . and it 's cheaper . " When schools opened there was no trouble until Herbert Brewer , a local farmer , with the help of Amis Guthridge , a Little Rock attorney , and head of the Capital Citizens Council , organized the opposition . Meetings were held , inflammatory speeches made , petitions circulated , and literature distributed . Parents were urged to withdraw their children from the schools , members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board closed the summer session a week early . When schools opened in the fall , the board asked the district judge to issue a restraining order calling upon Brewer and those working with him to cease interfering with the free operation of schools by acts of trespass , boycott , or picketing ; from in any manner deterring the attendance of children at school ; " from in any manner threatening or intimidating " the board of education . After a full hearing the order was issued and made permanent . Brewer and his associates appealed to the court of appeals . They contended that the injunction deprived them of their rights of speech , assembly , petition , and peaceful picketing and exposed them to prosecution for such innocent activities as campaigning against the re-election of school board members . The attorney general of Georgia came to their defense . The Hoxie board was not without its friends . For the United States Attorney General filed a brief in support of the board , the first intervention by the Department of Justice in any school suit . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The court held that school officials have a duty to desegregate , even in the absence of specific court instructions . As a necessary corollary , they have a federal right to be free from direct and deliberate interference with the performance of their constitutionally imposed duty . This is a right which the  | federal government may protect against abridgment by state officials or private persons . This would suggest that governors and state legislators who directly and deliberately interfere with school desegregation programs are guilty of violating federal civil rights statutes . What about Brewer 's constitutional rights ? The court of appeals pointed out that the injunction was aimed at acts and speech " calculated and intended , at the time and under the circumstances in which they were made , to incite disobedience of the law and to coerce . . . the school board to cease and desist from the performance of its sworn and lawful duty and to engage in unlawful conduct . " The Constitution does not protect the right to advocate disobedience of the courts when there is a clear and present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available to school authorities the injunctive protection of a federal court . This precedent was confirmed and extended by Judge Robert L. Taylor and the Clinton , Tennessee , School Board who refused to be intimidated by the then unknown but since famous , perhaps infamous , John Kasper . On January 4 , 1956 , after four years of litigation , Judge Taylor ordered the Anderson County School Board to admit pupils to Clinton High School on a racially nondiscriminatory basis beginning with the 1956 fall term.27 When schools opened , twelve Negroes joined 750 white classmates . There was some grumbling , but that was all . On August 25 John Kasper , executive secretary of the Seaboard Citizens Council of Washington , D.C. , came to Clinton and announced he intended to " get the niggers out of Clinton High School . " Kasper is often charged with the sole responsibility for the trouble that resulted . He did furnish the spark , but there was much discontented local sentiment to be ignited . Within two days there were picket lines around the school , and parents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mob attacked one of the Negro pupils .  | On August 29 , Judge Taylor , on petition of school officials , ordered Kasper and certain other individuals and " all other persons who are acting or may act in concert with them " to cease " hindering , obstructing , or any wise interfering with the carrying out of the aforesaid order of this Court , or from picketing Clinton High School , either by words or acts or otherwise . " It was further ordered that Kasper and the others named appear before Judge Taylor at 1:00 P.M. the next day to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be issued . That evening a United States marshal served these orders on Kasper as he was about to speak in front of the local courthouse . Kasper read the restraining order but was not restrained . He told his audience they need obey neither the order nor the desegregation ruling . He lashed out at school officials and Judge Taylor . The next morning Kasper was back at his old stand in front of the high school somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boycotting and picketing . School officials reported to Judge Taylor about Kasper 's speech and they asked that he be arrested and tried for contempt . At the request of the court , the United States district attorney participated at the hearing of Kasper . After trial , Judge Taylor held that the restraining order had properly been issued , that the evidence justified its continuance as a preliminary injunction , and that Kasper had willfully violated the restraining order . Kasper was sentenced to a year in jail , but allowed his freedom on bail , pending appeal . On appeal Kasper argued that Judge Taylor 's injunction ? broader than the one issued in the Hoxie case ? infringed on First Amendment freedoms by prohibiting peaceful picketing , lawful assembly , and free speech . The American Civil Liberties Union , although seeing no civil liberties issue in the contempt punishment , supported Kasper 's contention that the injunction was too sweeping . The words " any wise interfering with the court order , " the ACLU argued , were too vague to meet due process  | standards and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ACLU contended , persons have a constitutional right to advocate the flouting of judicial orders except where there is a clear and present danger of illegal conduct . ' ? However , the court of appeals held : " The speech here enjoined was clearly calculated to cause a violation of law and speech of that character is not within the protection of the First Amendment . " 30 The clear and present danger test was met by the mob violence resulting from Kasper 's speeches . The court ruled , on the basis of Supreme Court precedents , that picketing may be enjoined when it becomes enmeshed with violence and even peaceful picketing may be banned when it is for an unlawful purpose , such as coercing a school board to violate a court order . It was hoped Judge Taylor 's action against Kasper would place a damper upon the activities of the rioters . However , pending his appeal , Kasper was free and remained in Clinton . To the uninformed , it appeared that Kasper was going unpunished even though he had deliberately flouted the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little deterring effect . On the day of Kasper 's first trial , Clinton 's six-man police force was unable to maintain order . The governor sent the National Guard , order was restored , and by Labor Day the Negro students were back in class and student attendance was normal . Although there were sporadic incidents , tension gradually subsided . Then , on November 17 , Kasper and his ringleaders were brought to trial by county authorities for inciting riots . A local jury acquitted them . Thus encouraged , the extremists renewed their efforts , there was a reactivation of picketing , and a flurry of violence followed . By the end of the month Negro students were again forced to withdraw from school .  | The harassed school authorities and local officials appealed to the federal government for help . At first they secured none . After additional violence , including an attack on a popular minister , the board closed Clinton High School , again urged the Attorney General to intervene , and finally the Department of Justice acted . The district attorney petitioned Judge Taylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who it was alleged had conspired with him to violate the injunction first issued in September and made permanent in January . The court issued the necessary orders . The persons named were taken into custody . This , combined with an overwhelming defeat for citizens council candidates in the local city election , led to a restoration of order . Schools were opened and the county attorney warned students that misconduct on their part would lead to expulsion and might be in violation of Judge Taylor 's injunction . Trial of Kasper and his companions was postponed until July 1957 , by which time the number of persons charged with contempt had been reduced to twelve and the federal government assumed full responsibility for their prosecution before a jury . The defendants had the support of the attorneys general of several southern states . They received financial aid from the Governor of Georgia and other prominent segregationists . For ten days , eighteen defense attorneys challenged the proceedings , but after four hours the jury brought in a verdict of guilty against seven of the defendants , including Kasper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on bail pending appeal . Kasper was to have one other brush with the injunctive power of federal judges before he finally landed in a federal penitentiary . Despite setbacks in Hoxie and Clinton , segregationists believed they had a one-two punch to knock out judicial integration decrees : one , encourage violence or at least do not discourage it ; two , use the violence as an excuse to keep Negroes out of " white " schools . When schools opened in 1957 segregationists brought these tactics into play in Little Rock and Nashville . In ? Nashville they did not work ; in Little Rock they did .  | The two cities make an interesting comparison . They have much in common . Both are middle-sized state capitals standing just outside the upper Mississippi River country . Until 1957 both were , and Nashville is still today , open cities : a man could publicly stand up as an integrationist without suffering more than a few crank calls and poison-pen letters . A Negro could be active in the affairs of the NAACP without jeopardizing his job or family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traditional segregated pattern , they had a long history of peaceful race relations , more peaceful than most northern cities . Buses in both communities were desegregated in 1956 without difficulty . Negroes serve on the Nashville City Council and on the school board , and in Little Rock , except for a brief interlude , moderates have always been in charge of city affairs . Obviously most white citizens prefer to send their children to schools from which Negroes are excluded , but prior to the late summer of 1957 , by all the signs they had accepted the necessity of making minor adjustments . There seemed to be wide community support behind the six-man Little Rock School Board which just six days after the Supreme Court 's 1954 decision stated : " It is our responsibility to comply with Federal Constitutional Requirements and we intend to do so when the Supreme Court of the United States outlines the method to be followed . " 31 In Nashville a similar pronouncement was made . In 1955 the Little Rock board announced its program of gradual integration : there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school for Negroes was being finished . Then in September 1957 a few selected Negro students were to be admitted to Central High School , one of the three such schools for white students . Over the next six years there was to be a gradual and limited extension of this policy covering other grades . A liberal transfer provision was adopted to minimize the actual number of mixed classrooms and schools . It was frankly ad- mitted that this plan , known after the Superintendent of Education , Virgil Blossom , as the " Blossom Plan , " was designed to reduce integration to the minimum amount acceptable to the courts . In Nashville the board of education elected to start desegregation in 1957 with just the first grade , moving up one year at a time . A liberal transfer program was also established so that any white parent who wished to have his child transferred out of a school to which Negroes had been assigned could do so . The school district lines were redrawn to reduce the number of schools with mixed classes . This plan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of desegregation over the longest period of time . In both cities Negroes sued , complaining that the proposed programs failed to meet constitutional standards . In 1955 Judge William E. Miller approved the Nashville Plan and Judge John E. Miller ( no relation ) approved the Little Rock Plan . After their decisions were sustained by the courts of appeals for their respective circuits , the Negro plaintiffs decided to litigate no more and pledged their support to make the programs successful . School officials now set about preparing the community to accept integration . In Nashville Superintendent Bass and in Little Rock Superintendent Blossom each explained to more than two hundred civic and religious groups that the planned programs would make no significant change in the segregated pattern of schools , and pointed out that whatever one felt personally , some desegregation was inevitable . They reported they received , if not an enthusiastic , at least a sympathetic response . Local civic leaders assured their respective school boards of support . In each city one of the major newspapers ? The Banner in Nashville and the Arkansas Democrat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coming of desegregation , but the other major newspaper ? The Tennessean in Nashville and the Arkansas Gazette in Little Rock ? added strong editorial support . Segregationists in Nashville and Little Rock seemed unable to  | organise much opposition . In the spring of 1957 two segregationists were defeated by a two-to-one majority when they tried to unseat incumbent members of the Little Rock Board of Education . Fifty per cent of the voters of Little Rock refused to support even a mild anti-desegregation referendum calling for an amendment to the national Constitution to legitimatize segregation . At the state level , outside of Nashville , in western Tennessee , and outside of Little Rock , in eastern Arkansas , segregationists were considerably stronger . They had forced segregation laws through their respective state legislatures . But the governors of the two states gave no sign of using these laws to interfere with their capital cities ' programs . Governor Frank Clement of Tennessee was a moderate who had called out the National Guard to prevent a Kasper-inspired mob from creating riots in Clinton . Governor Orval Faubus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1956 gubernatorial campaign , he had defeated an ardent segregationist , Senator Jim Johnson , later elected to the Arkansas Supreme Court . Moreover , Faubus had refused to interfere with desegregation programs previously carried out in other Arkansas cities , despite the considerable urgings of segregationists . In his election campaigns Faubus had had the support of the state 's liberals and had refrained from inflammatory comments . He had appointed Negroes to important positions within state and party . All looked well in both cities for the peaceful passing of the old order . In both cities segregationists continued to agitate . In Nashville the Tennessee Federation of Constitutional Government , a " gentleman's-type " organization , created a front group ? the Parents ' Preference Committee ? to collect six thousand signatures on a petition stipulating that the signers preferred segregation . No petition was needed to demonstrate that Nashville 's white parents preferred segregation , but it was used by the Tennessee federation to urge the board to invoke the Tennessee preference law . This law authorized local boards to establish three kinds of schools : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three days before schools were to open and after Negro children had already registered , the Nashville board weakened . It petitioned Judge William E. Miller for permission to postpone desegregation and to use the preference plan . Judge Miller , a handsome , forty-nine-year-old graduate of the Yale Law School , had been appointed to the bench by President Eisenhower in March 1955 . Before that time he had been active in Republican politics , an unsuccessful candidate for Congress and delegate to the 1953 Constitutional Convention , and a law partner of Judge Taylor.3Y Judge Miller promptly ruled against the Tennessee preference law and told the board to proceed as planned . School officials trusted that Judge Miller 's decision would finally dispel any hopes that the community might harbor that there was any way it could squirm out of desegregation . The board still had to reckon with the troublemakers . While free , pending appeal on his Clinton convictions , John Kasper transferred his attention to Nashville . Late in August he came to town and started his usual routine . He attracted small audiences at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city detectives . He accused Mayor Ben West , Judge Miller , the Supreme Court , and Nashville newspapers , of being part of a " Jewish-Communist conspiracy . " 33 He told his avid followers he was against dynamiting public schools , but hinted it might get to that point . He was joined in his rabble-rousing by another Nashville visitor , one John Mercurio , a self-styled preacher , and by a local minister , the Reverend Fred Stroud , who had been previously expelled from the Presbyterian Church and who had  | long been active " exposing " the " communist influence " in the major Protestant denominations . Few paid much attention to these three apostles of hate . It is highly questionable if Kasper and his associates would have been able to whip up any sizable following if they had not been vicariously supported by the Governor of Arkansas . Over in Little Rock Faubus was making international news . His intervention had a " backlash " impact on Nashville ; it helped make resistance respectable and it encouraged the segregationists , who intensified their work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nashville 's schools opened . Nineteen six-yearold Negro children appeared at seven previously " white " schools . The entire Nashville police force of 115 was on duty . Pickets appeared at each of the schools , but police were under orders to make no arrests and to let the pickets alone so long as there were no overt acts of violence . There were catcalls , speeches , and scuffling . All the white parents had been telephoned the night before and told there would be danger if they brought their children to school . Many of the parents reached school authorities to explain they were keeping their children at home , not to protest the admission of the Negroes , but out of fear for their own children 's safety . Within the schoolrooms the teachers did their best to ignore the crowds outside . Many Nashville citizens who to that moment were strong supporters of segregation were now so appalled at the intensity of human hate that henceforth they became active " moderates . " But for the moment Kasper and his followers were left undisturbed . Encouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they organized more rallies that night . The Tennessean received an anonymous call late that night warning that the Fehris school would be bombed within an hour . The police were notified but they found nothing . At 12:36 A.M. Hattie Cotton School was bombed . The next morning Chief of Police Douglas E. Hosse faced his police detachments . " This has gone beyond a matter of integra- tion , " he told his men . " These people have ignored the laws and they have shown no regard for you or any citizen . " 34 When the demonstrators tried to throw up their picket lines around the schools , they found police barricades . Any adult who could not explain his presence was ordered to leave . Those who refused were arrested . Kasper and his lieutenants were picked up by the police . After Kasper posted bond on one charge , he was rearrested on another , once because of illegal parking while in police headquarters . He posted more bond . He was arrested again . Finally his supporters ran out of money . Professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magistrate gave Kasper a stern lecture and sent him off to the workhouse . As one veteran Nashville newspaperman put it : " In southern cities there are three types of justice , white man 's justice , poor white trash justice , and nigger justice . For the first time in history , a white man was given nigger justice . " A few days later , Mayor West , after a day-long conference with the United States district attorney , decided to petition Judge Miller for a restraining order to forbid Kasper , Mercurio , Stroud , and eight other individuals and all who acted in concert with them from picketing or in any other manner attempting to interfere with the orderly desegregation of the schools . Judge Miller granted the order , copies were mimeographed and distributed to each policeman , and a hearing was set in which those named would have a chance to show cause why the order should not be made permanent . The " get-tough " policy worked . By the day of the hearing the schools were back in business . Kasper played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abject , injured innocent . For four hours his attorney read the Constitution and quoted the Bible , but it did Kasper and his supporters little good . The silence which his martyr 's role imposed on him was hard to bear . He tugged constantly at his attorney 's coat and passed notes to his fellow conspirators .  | Of those named in the injunction only Kasper , Stroud , and Mercurio appeared to know what was going on . Stroud , an older version of Kasper , with the same deep-set , intense eyes and the same compulsion to make speeches , was represented by the Tennessee Federation of Constitutional Government , which incidentally had refused to defend Kasper . Like many fanatics they argued their cause rather than their case . When they did get down to the issues at hand they contended that to enjoin Stroud from interfering with school integration would abridge his religious freedom since Stroud believed that integration is sinful and that he had a religious duty to preach against sin . Stroud took the stand to insist he was a man of peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not intended to create violence . Mercurio made long , disconnected speeches on various topics having no pertinence to the hearing but the substance of which was that everybody in the United States , with few exceptions , was a Communist . Of the others , only two still defended their cause . These two were under investigation in connection with school bombing . Under questioning as to why they were present on the school grounds , one responded , " To keep the niggers from shooting children . " The other persons named in the order were a confused and frightened lot who had little idea of what was going on and were obviously tools in the hands of Kasper , Mercurio , and Stroud . At the end of the long hearing , Judge Miller issued the injunction . Kasper was returned to jail so he had no opportunity to violate this court order . Eventually he was released on bail and left the city . At a later date , he returned and was convicted by local authorities of stirring up a riot . The combined weight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much for the segregationist forces . Gradually enrollments returned to normal . Each year a new grade has been desegregated . There have been only minor difficulties . In Arkansas things were going less smoothly . Little Rock had the misfortune of facing a showdown without effective leadership . Whereas Nashville had a strong mayor , a determined police  | chief , and a vigorous judge , in Little Rock Mayor Woodrow Wilson Mann had just been repudiated by the voters , who over his protest in November 1956 had voted in the city-manager form of government , to be installed in November 1957 . The city was operating with a lame-duck mayor and city council . Chief of Police Marvin Potts was opposed to integration and he did not have much heart for his assignment . Under the best circumstances he was not what one would call a tough cop . He resigned soon after schools were opened . Osro Cobb , the United States district attorney in Little Rock , was a mild-mannered , everybody's-friend type , a former state Republican chairman who did not have political stature in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become a federal judge , but failed to get backing from any local bar association . Nor was there any resident district judge . Judge Thomas C. Trimble had retired in 1955 and Judge John Miller , a native Arkansan from Arkansas 's other judicial district , had originally issued the Little Rock injunction . He disliked this assignment and arranged that the Little Rock suit be transferred to the docket of a visiting judge from North Dakota , Judge Ronald N. Davies , who was sitting in Little Rock on a temporary basis . Judge Davies , small in appearance and decisive in action , , was to show his mettle , but as an outsider he was an easy target and lacked political standing in Arkansas . Superintendent Virgil Blossom and his school board tried to step into the vacuum and take charge of the forces of moderation . Until 1957 Blossom was considered the most popular man in Little Rock , and he had the silent support of many civic and business leaders , but they were at first afraid to help him . A rather sizable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of them were fearful of taking a promi-  | nent role for fear of being caught in the cross fire ? for the antisemitic character of the segregationist was just beneath the surface . The events of Little Rock during the fall of 1957 are so well known that detailed account is unnecessary . During the summer Little Rock authorities had assigned nine Negro students to Central High . About sixty had asked to go ; permission was refused to all but seventeen carefully selected pupils , eight of whom removed themselves from the list . During August Little Rock 's segregationists , assisted by supporters from the eastern part of the state and under the leadership of Amis Guthridge and several local ministers , stepped up their campaign . Unlike Nashville , Little Rock had the dubious distinction of having home-grown agitators . They put advertisements in local newspapers , held mass meetings , and charged the school board with being tools of Mrs. L. C. Bates , head of the Arkansas NAACP . But their biggest effort was a giant rally featuring Governor Marvin Griffin of Georgia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rights Council of Georgia . The meeting was held on the night of August 22 . It was widely noted that Governor Faubus was absent from this $10-a-plate dinner , but he had asked Griffin and Harris to be his guests . Since Faubus was still thought to be a moderate , Harris had to explain to " our people " that he and " Marve " were staying at the Executive Mansion because they felt it would have been too rude to refuse . Griffin told his audience that whatever federal judges might say , he would never allow integration in Georgia . Harris urged the people of Arkansas to join Georgia in resisting federal encroachment to the last man . He told them that in Georgia they would use the highway patrol if necessary , just the way Governor Shivers had done ; he suggested that Governor Faubus should be urged to do the same thing . All observers ? segregationists , moderates , integrationistsagree that this visit by the emissaries from Georgia had an electrifying impact on Little Rock . Faubus had long been bombarded with messages by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intercede , but the speeches of Griffin and Harris , he later said , " triggered a charge . " Soon messages were pouring into the Executive Mansion . Superintendent Blossom stated : " Griffin and Harris had a tremendous amount of effect on this community . People kept saying to me , We do n't have to do this when the Governor of Georgia says nobody else has to do it .... ' " By the end of August Governor Faubus 's role , it was clear to all , would be crucial . Segregationists knew that without his support they could not stop integration . The school officials continued to be confident they could handle the situation , provided Faubus would let them . It would ease their minds considerably if they could get Faubus to make a simple public statement to the effect that he would tolerate no violence and would preserve law and order in the event he was needed , but failing to get that , all they wanted was for Faubus to leave them alone . Right up to the moment Faubus called out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governor to make the statement . They were in constant touch with him and made one desperate effort through the good offices of Winthrop Rockefeller , chairman of the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission and political associate of the governor . Rockefeller flew back to Little Rock and had a secret conference with Faubus who " did not say yes , ' but he did not say no . ' " The night before schools were to open Faubus told Blossom that he could not make any public statement supporting the board ? he was under too much pressure ? but after he had gone through the motions , he would not stand in the board 's way . Personally , he told Blossom , he felt the Little Rock plan was the best solution that had been offered in the United States and would become the model followed in other cities.3s At Faubus 's request , A. B. Caldwell , head of the Civil Rights Section of the Department of Justice , a native and former resi- dent of Arkansas , was sent to Little Rock on August 28 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the most part of questions put to Caldwell by Faubus as to what action the Department of Justice would take in event of disturbances . Caldwell told Faubus that the federal government was not a party to the litigation that had resulted in the desegregation decree and disturbances in the city would not of themselves furnish a basis of federal intervention . " What about Clinton , Tennessee ? " the governor inquired . Caldwell explained that federal officials became involved there only after the school board had asked for an injunction against Kasper and the judge had requested the help of the department in making his order effective . As Warren Olney III , then head of the Criminal Division , said later : " The governor 's subsequent action has given the conference a significance which was not appreciated at the time. , , 37 Faubus , thus assured that he need not fear federal intervention , was free to proceed with his own plans . On the other hand , Caldwell , who also talked with Blossom and Little Rock officials , could give them no promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before schools were to open , Mrs. Clyde A. Thomason , secretary of the Mothers League of Central High , a recently created organization , went before State Chancellor Murray O. Reed to request an injunction forbidding the board to allow Negroes to enroll at Central High . This suit was undertaken by the . Mothers League at Governor Faubus 's suggestion after he had failed to persuade the school board to do so . Faubus testified in favor of the injunction , saying there was danger of bloodshed . Chancellor Reed issued the injunction " not to impair the basic principle announced in Brown v. Board of Education , " he said , but " solely to preserve peace . " 38 No one knew it at the time , but the very day he testified in chancery  | court , Governor Faubus was in touch with Major General Sherman T. Clinger , commander of the Arkansas Guard , giving him secret orders to prepare for action.39 The state chancellor 's injunction did not relieve educational authorities of their obligation to comply with the mandate of the United States district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe . On August 30 they went before Judge Davies for instructions . He told the board he would " neither hesitate nor equivocate " and reminded them of their legal duties . Furthermore , he himself enjoined Mrs. Thomason and " all other persons ... from in any manner , directly and indirectly , interfering with or hindering the actions of petitioners in carrying out the Decrees of this Court entered herein on August 15 , 1956. " 40 Although this injunction warned Faubus and anyone else not to interfere , because of its sweeping nature there are serious doubts it would afford the basis of contempt citations against any person other than Mrs. Thomason and for any action other than the continued prosecution of the state court proceedings . Judge Davies dashed any hope that Faubus might have had that he could use the state courts to prevent integration . Schools were scheduled to open on Monday , September 3 . Segregationists were desperate . Blossom had a talk with the nine Negro students scheduled to take the long walk to Central High . Their parents were naturally concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to school for fear that their presence might provoke trouble . He assured them that steps had been taken to assure the safety of their children . And so , as one parent said , " We turned our children over to the white people . " Blossom still had not given up hope that Faubus might come around and publicly back Little Rock officials . On September 2 he had a long talk with Faubus , but at the conclusion of his  | conversation he turned to Lieutenant Jackson of the Little Rock Police Force and said , " I am afraid Governor Faubus himself is behind this program of intimidation . " 41 Even as he talked with Blossom , Governor Faubus had already decided to call out the National Guard . That night he made Central High " the most famous high school in the world . " 42 Two hundred guardsmen quietly took up positions surrounding the school . The school board was in special session making lastminute preparations when word came that the governor was making a television address . For the first time they and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He told them that he had been forced to act to prevent massive violence . He did not tell them that he had secretly instructed the National Guard commander to exclude Negroes from the school premises , a deliberate frustration of the orders of the district court . 43 The board issued a statement calling on the Negro students to stay away from school the next morning . When school opened the Negro pupils made no attempt to enter . About two or three hundred people stood quietly to watch the white students file into Central High . Meanwhile the school board 's attorney had gone to the third floor of the United States Post Office , where Judge Davies held court , to ask for instructions . After a four-minute hearing , including the testimony of Mayor Mann that there was no evidence of massive uprising or trouble which the Little Rock police could not handle , Judge Davies said : " An order will be issued tonight , directing you to put into effect forthwith the plan of integration which you presented to a judge of this court and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appeals . " The  | board announced , " The plan of desegregation ordered by the federal court is still in force and effect . " 44 On September 4 , before the eyes of the world , the nine Negro students walked down the long street . In front of them were the National Guard . To the other side a jeering crowd . Guardsmen blocked the way and the Negro students were forced back through the howling mob . Although they were spat upon and names were hurled at them , there was no other violence . They were forced to leave the scene . Central High was still segregated . In Washington President Eisenhower commented : " We are going to whip this thing in the long run by Americans being true to themselves and not merely by law . " This offered little immediate help to school officials and provided little comfort to Judge Davies , who was confronted with a condition that could hardly wait to allow Americans to ignore the law until they learned to be " true to themselves . " Somewhat more encouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presence of so many FBI agents in Little Rock . The President said : " When I became President , I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States . The only assurance I can give you is that the federal Constitution will be upheld by me , by every legal means at my command . " 45 In Little Rock the school board asked Judge Davies to suspend the integration decree . The board pointed out that the governor 's action had made it impossible for them to proceed . Privately they asked Judge Davies to order the United States marshal to assist them in carrying out the order , but the judge refused , perhaps feeling that it was not his responsibility to precipitate such a head-on clash between the marshal and the Arkansas National Guard.46 For three days Little Rock 's Central High operated without the Negro students . Behind the scenes the Department of Justice was considering what line to take . On Saturday morning , Sep- tember 7 , Judge Davies held a brief open hearing on the board 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Judge Davies asked Blossom if the plan of integration had been discussed before civic groups and whether the plan appeared to be acceptable to them . Blossom said he had spoken before 125 groups when the plan was first adopted , and about fifty more since . The plan " was accepted . . . . The people did not want integration but they accepted it as the best solution to a difficult problem . " Judge Davies declared a forty-five-minute recess . At eleven o'clock he returned and read his decision slowly . He pointed out that the integration plan had originated and was conceived by the citizens of Little Rock . He said that Mayor Mann had reported not a single case of interracial violence and that there was no indication that there would be violence . He added he had given careful consideration to the problem , but : " It must never be forgotten that I have a constitutional duty and obligation from which I shall not shrink . " He called the board 's petition for delay " anemic " and rejected it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chaos , " he said , " if the court decrees are flouted , whatever the pretext .... " 47 Even more significant , Davies instructed Osro Cobb , the United States district attorney , and Herbert Brownell , the Attorney General of the United States , to investigate the events leading to the governor 's intervention and to report to the court as soon as possible . For the first time , the Department of Justice was drawn into the fray . Even prior to this formal request the FBI had been gathering data ? there were so many FBI agents in Little Rock that newsmen had difficulty in finding hotel rooms . The FBI had documentary evidence that Faubus had originally instructed the Guard to exclude Negroes , that there was not , as Faubus had charged , any unusual sale of knives , guns , or other weapons , and that there had been no request , as Faubus had charged , by local  | authorities for his intervention . Two days after requested , Cobb turned the detailed FBI report over to Judge Davies . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberately frustrated the orders of his court , Davies ordered the Department of Justice to appear as amicus curiae . He instructed them to file a petition against the governor and his Guard commanders seeking such relief " as may be appropriate to prevent the existing interferences with and obstructions to the carrying out of the orders heretofore entered by the court in this case . " Judge Davies ' important move was unusual , but not unprecedented.48 Normally the plaintiffs , in this case , the parents of the Negro children , must initiate moves to secure enforcement of orders issued in their behalf . Here was an unusual situation calling for unusual action . A governor was challenging the authority of the federal government ; this was no longer an ordinary lawsuit . A federal judge has the right to call on the law officers of the United States for assistance . What had been heretofore a nominal case between Negro school patrons on one side and the school board on the other had turned into a conflict between the state of Arkansas and the national government . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from here on it was really the Department of Justice v. Orval Faubus . Judge Davies ' order to the Department of Justice came as no surprise . Since early September the local district attorney had been in constant contact with Washington conferring about the various legal moves which might be made . Although there is no evidence of prior consultations between Judge Davies and the district attorney 's office , the offices of the judge 's staff and the district attorney 's staff were only steps away from each other . Their respective staffs frequently had coffee and meals together . It would not have been unusual or unethical to talk over tactics . What kind of legal action should be taken ? There were several choices . The Department of Justice could have moved for an immediate contempt citation against Governor Faubus alleging  | a violation of the August 30 injunction against " any person " who in any manner " directly and indirectly " interfered with the plans of integration . Or they could have asked Judge Davies to issue a restraining order which would have forced Faubus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , Judge Davies privately instructed the Department to limit their petition to a request for a preliminary injunction.49 This choice allowed for a ten-day delay prior to a hearing giving Faubus a chance to conform with the requirements of the Constitution as he had promised to do when he met with President Eisenhower in Newport , Rhode Island . But on September 20 the Guard was still on duty , still with orders to turn away Negro pupils . At precisely 9:00 A.M. on the morning of September 20 Judge Davies called his court to order . The attention of the world was focused on this small room . Sitting on the judge 's right were the nine Negro children against whom the governor had called out his National Guard . They were dressed in their best , talking quietly and nervously among themselves . To his left , in the jury box , were the reporters of the national and international press . Each seat in the room was occupied ; on the left side were many of those who had felt compelled to spend the last several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " niggers " got in . One of these ladies announced to all , " Let me in ; I am a segregationist from the top of my head to the tip of my toes . " The right side of the aisle was occupied mostly by Negroes . They sat very quietly . Thousands jammed the narrow corridors outside , hoping to get a chance to see this climactic legal struggle . Crowded into the various small rooms leading off the narrow corridor were over two hundred witnesses whom the Department of Justice had called to be available if needed . The governor did not attend the hearing , but he was represented by three attorneys who had filed various motions asking for dismissal of the petition . They argued that Judge Davies should disqualify himself since he had a personal prejudice  | against the governor and a personal bias in favor of the plaintiffs . They challenged the right of the United States to petition the court for the injunction and to make the governor a party to the case . They made much of the fact that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had specifically refused to authorize the Attorney General to participate in the school-entry cases . Wiley A. Branton , the attorney who had represented the Negro students , was there . So was Thurgood Marshall . But they did not speak . They left it up to the attorneys for the Department of Justice . The major issue raised by Faubus 's lawyers was that the federal court lacked jurisdiction to restrain the operations of the chief executive of a sovereign state . They cited a 1909 Supreme Court decision ( Moyer v. Peabody ) in which the Court had ruled that a governor is the final judge of when the militia should be used to suppress violence within his state . The Department of Justice answered that in the Moyer case the governor had not interfered with the operation of a federal court . Moreover , in 1932 the Supreme Court had ruled ( Sterling v. Constantin ) that federal courts do have the authority to review the calling out of the militia " where there is a substantial showing that the exertion of state power has overridden private rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better part of the morning . When the argument was finished Judge Davies held that all the dismissal motions lacked substance . " Any further preliminary matters ? " he asked . Faubus 's chief counsel rose : " The Governor of the State of Arkansas can not and will not concede that the United States in this court or anywhere else can question his discretion and judgment as chief executive of a sovereign state .... In view of that , if the court please , may counsel for respondents be excused ? " " You may be excused , " said Judge Davies . The governor 's attorneys walked out of the courtroom , sparing themselves the embarrassment of having to present evidence  | to support Faubus 's contention that he had acted to prevent violence , not to prevent integration . Over in the state house , the governor , using what appears to be a somewhat sacrilegious but nonetheless favorite analogy of demagogues , commented , " Now begins the crucifixion . " The rest of the hearing was concerned with the question , " Did the governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a strategical mistake by joining the argument on this largely irrelevant question . Even if there had been such evidence , it would in no way have legally justified Faubus 's using troops to prevent Negroes from attending Central High . This strategy played right into Faubus 's hands and itself indirectly encouraged violence . After the Guard was withdrawn , Faubus and his supporters could claim vindication only if riots did develop . It was naive on the part of the federal authorities to fail to recognize that their insistence that Faubus had been lying would practically force the segregationists to produce the violence so they could say " we told you so . " Finally , if the Department of Justice was going to try to undermine Faubus 's contention that he had acted because he knew that otherwise there would be massive violence , they should have gone all out to prove their point . They could have released the FBI report , called all their witnesses , piling it on so convincingly that Faubus would be thoroughly discredited . However , they did not do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Superintendent Blossom , Mayor Mann , Chief of Police Potts , Jesse Mathews , principal of Central High , the president of the school board , and three of the nine Negro students . All testified they had been fully prepared to handle any incidents , had not asked Faubus to intervene , had no evidence indicating they could not have proceeded with desegregation without serious public disturbances . At the conclusion of the hearing Judge Davies announced : " It is . . . demonstrable from the testimony here today that there would have been no violence in carrying out the plan of integration , and that there has been no violence . " The judge then  | enjoined Faubus " from obstructing or preventing by use of the National Guard or otherwise attendance of Negro students at Little Rock High School ... and from otherwise obstructing or interfering with orders of this court in connection with the plan of integration . " Judge Davies 's order did not require Faubus to withdraw the National Guard , but merely to refrain from using the Guard to prevent Negroes from entering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any federal authority deny that Faubus had the right to use the Guard to preserve the peace . But as Judge Davies wrote in his formal opinion released the following day : " If it be assumed that the Governor was entitled to bring military force to the aid of civil authority , the proper use of that power in this instance was to maintain the Federal Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction , to aid in making its process effective , and not to nullify it , to remove , and not create , obstructions to the exercise by the Negro children of their rights as judicially declared . " That night every television set in Little Rock was channeled to hear Faubus . It was a speech cleverly contrived . He accused Judge Davies of " unwarranted and biased " action ; he lashed out at newsmen , naming six of them ; he called on the Negro pupils to exercise restraint ; and he iterated and reiterated his contention that if and when they tried to enter Central High there would be bloodshed . Nonetheless , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made this contribution to peace and good order , Faubus left the city to attend the Governors ' Conference at Seaford , Georgia , and to receive the plaudits of segregationists for his determined stand . The man they thought was a moderate had turned out to be their hero . Sometime over the weekend the decision was made that the Negro students should enter Central High the next Monday morning . Chief Potts made his preparations . Segregationists had big advertisements in Little Rock newspapers calling for a " big demonstration " to show the people that they were behind the  | governor . There were wild rumors going throughout the city of carloads of men coming into town from eastern Arkansas to " keep the niggers out . " Potts decided that his police would not disperse the crowd but keep them behind barricades and otherwise leave them alone . The state police were called and it was thought they would lend a hand if needed . What happened on Monday morning when the nine Negro students started to Central High School is history . Mob violence was triumphant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screaming , hysterical mob of over one thousand , but the Little Rock police , who had failed to disperse this unlawful assembly ? and who did not receive any help from state police ? were forced to accede to the demands of the rioters : the nine teen-age Negro students were hustled out of the building . Word of the riot was flashed to the President . To this moment the President had taken no direct hand in the Little Rock affair . Maxwell Rabb , the President 's special assistant on minority matters , had been in close touch with Mayor Mann and that morning the President issued a proclamation calling on " all persons engaged in such obstruction of justice to cease and desist therefrom , and to disperse forthwith .... " During the afternoon Mann called Rabb to ask for help . He reported that unless the President sent in federal troops the Little Rock police could not break the mob rule . The President decided to wait and see . On Tuesday morning , September 24 , two hundred and fifty people gathered in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro students made no attempt to enter . Mann called Rabb and they decided the mayor should send a telegram to the President formally requesting help . At 10:22 A.M. Little Rock time the President ordered the Arkansas National Guard into federal service and instructed parts of the famed 101st Airborne Division stationed at nearby Fort Campbell to surround Central High and to enforce the court 's order . By that evening the troops were in position . On Wednesday morning , September 25 , an army station  | wagon delivered the Negro students to school and troops escorted them into the building . A crowd gathered , but the troops , using standard riot-prevention procedures , refused to allow them to assemble and forced them to disperse . Eight persons were taken into custody . From then on a token force of federalized guardsmen maintained order outside the high school . Did the President have the constitutional authority to send the troops to Little Rock ? Faubus argued that Congress in 1957 had repealed the provision authorizing the Chief Executive to use military force to protect civil rights . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making it a crime for any person to use willfully any part of the Army or Air Force to execute the laws , " except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress . " The President , charged the governor , had no authority to use troops in Arkansas without the consent of state officials . The governor was wrong . Congress did repeal statutory language authorizing the President to use troops to enforce civil rights laws , but this language was superfluous . For Congress also reaffirmed two laws adopted in 1782 and 1861 authorizing the President to use the militia and armed forces " whenever it is impracticable to enforce the laws of the United States ... by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings . " 53 The prohibition against using the armed forces applies only where there is no authorization and was passed by Congress to limit United States marshals calling out the armed forces as part of their posses .54 Furthermore , even in the absence of specific congressional authorization , the President has the constitutional duty " to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the Supreme Court in 1890 , this includes the authority to enforce " the rights , duties , and obligations growing out of the Constitution itself ...  | and all the protection implied by the nature of the government under the Constitution .... " No President need wait for an invitation from state authorities to enforce federal laws . The government of the United States does not operate within a state by the grace of state authorities . On September 24 President Eisenhower issued a statement of principles emphasizing that the duty to formulate desegregation plans belongs to state authorities . Governors , he said , do have the responsibility for maintaining domestic order . " However , under the pretext of maintaining order , a Governor may not interpose military force or permit mob violence to occur so as to prevent the final order of a Federal court from being carried out . " And the President warned , " When an obstruction of justice has been interposed or mob violence is permitted to exist so that it is impracticable to enforce the laws by the ordinary course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution and laws is inescapable . He is obliged to use whatever means may be required by the particular situation . " So it was that those who insisted that the mobs in the street shout with the voices of the people were not allowed to have their way . Orval Faubus made a major contribution to the cause of desegregation . He made it impossible for President Eisenhower to continue to ignore those persons in high authority who had been using the threat of violence to justify their frustration of federal judicial decrees . Before Faubus 's clumsiness compelled the President to intervene , the University of Alabama , Governor Shivers , and the Florida Supreme Court had been allowed to get away with their tactics . Faubus only did more openly what others had done before him . But Faubus so bluntly used these preserver-ofpeace tactics that even Eisenhower had to meet the challenge . After Faubus and Little Rock , it was no longer possible to use violence to justify the continuation of segregation in the face of contrary federal court orders . In January 1961 , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Georgia suspended  | two Negro students who had been admitted a few days before under an order issued by Judge Bootle . Judge Bootle immediately ordered their reinstatement . He made it clear that he would call on the President for federal forces if state authorities could not or would not keep order . He quoted from a decision of the Supreme Court and added , " Nor can the lawful orders of this court be frustrated by violence and disorder . " Others may try , but the enthronement of lawlessness no longer provides a technique to circumvent federal desegregation decrees .  | Deprived by Judge Davies of the legal right to use the National Guard to keep Negroes out of Central High ; deprived by President Eisenhower of the opportunity to use mob rule to keep Central High white , segregationists turned to new tactics : indirect aggression . If they could harass the Negro students , make their life so miserable that one morning they would just decide not to go to Central High any more , segregationists could have their way . And there would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do about it . But would the segregationists be allowed to intimidate the students ? At first it looked as though they would be kept in check . Seventy-four students active in the riots were suspended from Central High . St. John Barret , from the Civil Rights Section of the Department of Justice , came to Little Rock . FBI agents identified those who were trying to encourage white students to harass the Negroes and to bully any white student who showed any sign of friendliness . School officials pressed the Department of Justice to prosecute , warning that unless the adults who were egging the students on were brought in line there would be little hope of maintaining  | discipline within the school . The Attorney General agreed that a prosecution would have a healthy restraining impact not only in Little Rock but throughout the South , and some members of the local United States attorney 's office thought they had enough evidence to make a conviction stick . Attorneys in the Department of Justice had two choices . They could have asked Judge Davies to order the ringleaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not to interfere with Negro pupils attending Central High . Such an injunction had been successfully used in Hoxie , Clinton , and Nashville . Or the lawyers for the United States could have tried to use the Civil Rights Act of 1870 , which makes it a crime for two or more persons to conspire to deprive a citizen of rights secured by the Constitution . The Negro pupils had a constitutional right to attend Central High ; the school board had a constitutional right to obey the court 's mandate without direct interference . Judge Davies was vacationing in his Fargo , North Dakota , home , but with his return , federal prosecution was expected . As long as federal action was expected segregationists , although they tried , were unable to create much trouble . A strike at Central High failed when fewer than sixty students participated . A segregationists ' slate for the city council was defeated in the November elections . Then on November 21 , the newly appointed Attorney General , William Rogers , announced that the United States had dropped plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were afraid they could not persuade a grand jury to indict the troublemakers or a trial jury to convict them . To fail would be taken as " proof " that a conspiracy to intimidate Negro pupils did not exist and a sign of the impotence of the federal government . ' Nor would the Department of Justice initiate action for an injunction . Such a move , the federal lawyers said , was up to the school board . The FBI withdrew in force from Little Rock . On the same day that Attorney General Rogers announced there would be no federal prosecutions , thirteen white persons  | arrested for their part in the rioting during the opening days of Central High were cleared of the charges against them by Little Rock Municipal Court Judge Harry C. Robinson . The only person fined was a Negro student attending a Negro school who had been picked up for carrying a gun.2 As for state officials , they refused to prosecute anybody except two NAACP officials charged with violating a recently enacted anti-NAACP law.3 Little Rock was defenseless . The city would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal government would not prosecute . The school board even refrained from disciplining unruly students . Federalized guardsmen were on duty in the halls of Central High , but there were miles of corridors . Furthermore , the guardsmen were not allowed to testify against any student . Inside the classrooms teachers kept order and there was not a single incident during the entire stormy school year in the classrooms themselves . But during the brief period between classes the Negro students were exposed to their tormentors . Of the more than 1200 students at Central High , about 150 participated in these activities , and only two dozen were active . But they were very active ! During the year there were forty-three bomb threats , thirty fires , innumerable firecracker explosions . The Negro pupils were shoved , their lockers rifled , and their books destroyed . '  | Troublemakers were suspended for three or four days and then allowed to return to school . Two students were expelled ; one a white student . She then made a television address , sponsored by segregationists , accusing school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was readmitted . The other , a Negro girl , was expelled permanently for calling one of her tormentors " white trash . " Toward the end of the school year , Police Chief Eugene G. Smith , who had taken over from Potts , took a more determined stand . But the local magistrates refused to back him up . For example , on May 25 , during the Baccalaureate service , Curtis E. Stover , an eighteen-year-old white youth , spat in the face of one of the Negro girls . The police intervened , and Stover cursed the police . He was arrested for disorderly conduct and brought before Traffic Judge Robert W. Laster . Laster was one of Little Rock 's most prominent segregationists . So was young Stover 's mother . When the deputy city attorney tried to question Stover , Judge Laster ordered him to stop . " This boy , " he said , " just gave way to an emotion he could n't control . There is no insult worse than spitting in someone 's face , but if anyone is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. O. Powell , vice principal for boys in Central High , testified that if he had been allowed to crack down on the five or ten of the student leaders who were tools of outside adults , " we would have had a much smoother disciplinary problem . " But the school board felt they lacked the power to make their action stick . Furthermore , they argued that a " tough policy " would have merely aroused more opposition . During most of the school year there was no resident federal judge . Judge Davies returned to his home district and the vacancy was still unfilled . Ministers held days of prayer and the Arkansas Gazette tried to rally moderate support behind the school board . But no one took any action against the troublemakers , and in the churches they attended the ministers were praying to preserve the whiteness of Central High .  | Many have questioned the wisdom of Little Rock 's initiation of its desegregation program at the high school level . Superintendent W. H. Oliver in Nashville has pointed out : " There is lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no worries about school dances to contend with , no fears of interracial dating , and if two five-year-olds bump into each other in the hall , they are not likely to precipitate a riot . Little Rock authorities rejected a proposal to start integration with the first grade because it would have required mixed classes in several schools , while by beginning at the high school , they could restrict integration to a single school . They had hoped this would diminish opposition . They were wrong . Instead it was possible for segregationists to concentrate their attentions ; it made Central High a battlefield . With first graders there might have been less intimidation . One has to be pretty mean to threaten a six-year-old , even if he is black . On the other hand , would any parent have been willing to expose a small child to what the Little Rock nine had to go through ? Could a six-year-old be expected to understand the stakes involved ? The miracle of Little Rock is that the Negro students refused to give in . The Little Rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , mature enough to stand the day-by-day pressures , secure in the knowledge that outside of Central High they had the moral backing of people from all over the world . When the year ended , eight of the nine were still in Central High . Ernest Green received his diploma with 601 classmates ; Carlotta Weeks , sixteen , was on the class honor roll . The segregationists , nevertheless , were making some progress . On February 20 , 1958 , the Little Rock School Board filed a motion asking the district court to allow them to suspend desegregation for two and one-half years , and transfer the Negro pupils back to the " colored " school . The motion was assigned to the docket of Judge Harry J. Lemley , a seventy-two-year-old jurist , who normally held court  | in the eastern part of Arkansas , a man who said , " The South is almost a religion with me. " 8 The board did not think they had much chance of getting court sanction for resegregation ; nonetheless , they told Judge Lemley of their problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They conceded that none of their difficulties had been caused by the Negro students . Judge Lemley several times kept pressing the attorney for the school board about the impact of the presence of federal troops on the educational program , a point which the school board attorneys had given little emphasis . But upon questioning by Judge Lemley they said the presence of the troops had been " distracting . " Why did the authorities think conditions might be improved in two and one-half years ? Wayne Upton , president of the board , told Lemley that by February 1961 Governor Faubus might no longer be in office . Blossom testified that by then the courts could have passed on the various segregation laws being turned out by the Arkansas General Assembly . Perhaps by then the citizens would finally come to recognize that they must desegregate . However , at the present time , said Blossom , because of the pronouncements of state officers , many citizens in Little Rock were completely confused about the law ; they had come to feel that there was no constitutional or legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NAACP 's argument was that the rights of Negro students should not be forfeited because of the violence of others , and that if the judge were to suspend the desegregation program , segregationists in every other school district would be encouraged to render court injunctions impotent . The NAACP produced witnesses from outside Little Rock ? Dr. Virgil M. Rogers of Syracuse University , and Dr. David G. Salten , superintendent of schools in Long Beach , Long Island ? who criticized Little Rock authorities for not dealing more severely with troublemakers . In fact , the school board 's own wit- nesses had admitted they could have maintained order if allowed to do so . But the NAACP 's expert witnesses admitted they were not familiar with the local situation ; the political and legal consequences of using these " outsiders and Yankees " to question procedures used by the local board did not help the NAACP . Although Judge Lemley invited United States District Attorney Osro Cobb to participate in the proceedings , he refused . Then on June 21 , 1958 , to the surprise of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote : It is important to realize . . . that the racial incidents and vandalism which occurred . . . did not stem from mere lawlessness on the part of the white students in the school or on the part of the people of Little Rock . . . . Rather , the source of the trouble was the deep-seated popular opposition in Little Rock to the principle of integration . . . . To this opposition was added the conviction of many of the people of Little Rock , that the Brown decisions do not truly represent the law ... . It is not denied that . . . the Negro students . . . have a constitutional right not to be excluded from any of the public schools on account of race ; but the board has convincingly shown that the time for the enjoyment of that right has not yet come ... . We do not think that its the board 's failure to commence criminal action or to seek injunctive relief against the vandals should militate against its present position . . . . By reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to integration in Little Rock , action by the board . . . might have aggravated rather than eased the situation. ? Judge Lemley 's ruling was a major victory for the segregationists . Three days later Judge Lemley refused to stay his order pending review . The NAACP went directly to the Supreme Court asking that it exercise its discretionary authority and hear the case immediately without waiting for the court of appeals . On June 29 the Supreme Court declined , but the justices stated : " We  | have no doubt that the Court of Appeals will recognize the vital importance of the time element in this litigation , and that it will act upon the application for a stay or the appeal in ample time to permit arrangements to be made for the next school year . " 10 Ten days later Chief Judge Archibald Gardner of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit assigned three circuit judges , but then , deciding that the case was of such importance that it should be heard by all seven members of the court of appeals , called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of Justice entered the proceedings , urging the court of appeals to reverse Judge Lemley . On August 18 , by a six-to-one vote ( the one dissenter was ninety-year-old Chief Judge Gardner ) , the court of appeals reversed Lemley . Judge Marion C. Matthes , speaking for the majority , wrote : We say the time has not yet come in these United States when an order of a federal court must be whittled away , watered down , or shamefully withdrawn in the face of violent and unlawful acts of individual citizens in opposition thereto . He pointed out that if Lemley 's order were affirmed every school district in which integration has been opposed would have " justifiable " excuses to petition the courts for delay . " An affirmance of temporary delay ' in Little Rock , " said Judge Matthes , " would amount to an open invitation to elements in other districts to overtly act out public opposition through violent and unlawful means . " 11 Lemley had been wrong , but in the normal course of events , the court of appeals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for it to have any impact before Central High would open on September 2 . Furthermore , at the request of the school board 's attorneys , the court of appeals had agreed to stay its instructions to Judge Lemley until their own ruling could be carried to the Supreme Court . Here was the situation : the court of appeals agreed Negro  | students should be allowed to attend Central High . Nonetheless , Judge Lemley 's decree would stay in effect until the Supreme Court considered the issues . Since the high court was not due to convene until October 6 , Faubus would have an opportunity to force the board to reopen Central High , transfer the Negro students back to their " colored " school , and score a notable psychological victory . Perhaps the court of appeals wanted to compel the Supreme Court to re-enter the fight . Since 1955 the Supreme Court had left the enforcement of the Brown decision to the district and circuit judges . If the court of appeals had immediately reversed Judge Lemley , the Supreme Court could have taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court of appeals . However , by staying its order , the court of appeals gave the Supreme Court the option of allowing Faubus to resegregate Central High or convoking a special session . The Supreme Court chose the latter . On August 28 it met in special session , for only the fifth time in thirty-eight years , to consider the NAACP motion to vacate the court of appeals stay order . Faubus , whose hand had been strengthened by his victorious bid for a third term , called the Arkansas General Assembly into special session . He told the legislators that they must pass six bills to give him , among other things , the power to close the public schools and lease the buildings to private institutions . Otherwise , he charged , the school board would integrate more schools . They were about ready , he said , to integrate " Eastside Junior High with approximately 50 per cent Negro students and 50 per cent white students , " 12 an unsubstantiated charge which helped to spur the legislature into doing Faubus 's bidding . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand persons lined up in front of the Supreme Court building . Normally 180 seats are reserved for the public , but there were so many lawyers and guests of the court and newsmen that  | there was room for only fifty others . At noon the marshal 's gavel banged . The preliminaries were disposed of and then Chief Justice Warren said , " Mr. Marshall . " Thurgood Marshall began his argument . He talked quietly and quickly for forty-five minutes . The justices interrupted frequently with questions . Then it was the turn of Richard C. Butler , attorney for the school board . Wayne Upton , the board president and a lawyer himself , sat with Butler at the counsel table , supplying information requested by the justices . Chief Justice Warren asked Butler what would happen to the Negro students if the Supreme Court should leave in effect the stay granted by the court of appeals . " They would be sent back to segregated schools . " Warren reminded Butler that the Court had previously ruled that " the vitality of these constitutional principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them . " He asked why the Court should defer the enforcement of constitutional rights because " some elements in the community would commit violence . " Butler did not answer directly , but he said that it would be unfair to force the Little Rock board , which had made a good faith attempt to desegregate , to go through another year of " trying circumstances " while officials in other districts who had refused to act were being allowed to defer desegregation for years . Solicitor General J. Lee Rankin had his turn . " Opposition to the Brown decision expressed in violence can not , " he said , " justify the abandonment or modification of the plan . " He urged the Court to vacate the stay . He said that in Virginia and elsewhere district judges were waiting to see what the Supreme Court would do , and if the Court should allow Lemley 's decision to stand it would bring to a complete halt all school-entry litigation . It would be taken as a sign that community opposition justified the postponement of desegregation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay . The justices recessed . The audience waited . Just after 5:00 P.M. , five hours after the session began , the Chief Justice announced the Court would delay any ruling on vacating the court  | of appeals ' stay order until September 11 , by which time all could present briefs dealing with the full merits of the case.13 The Little Rock School Board , braving Faubus 's wrath , announced that Little Rock schools would await the Supreme Court 's ruling and would not open until September 15 . On September 11 the courtroom drama was repeated . It was another crowded session . Butler spoke more than half the session . He argued that the school board was caught between state and federal governments , " helpless " to resolve the conflict , unable to put its integration program into effect because " of the total opposition of the people and the State Government of Arkansas . " The opposition was so strong , he said , that it would require federal troops to integrate and " you ca n't teach if you are going to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to defer certain intangible constitutional rights of a few Negro students than to destroy the full educational opportunities of two thousand students . . . . " But with a reasonable period of time " perhaps the extreme opposition could be overcome . " The justices questioned Butler closely . Said Justice Tom C. Clark : " What does the school board propose to do if it wins a two-and-a-half-year delay with reference to trying to effect a program to carry out desegregation ? " Butler : " . . . It has not made any particular plans .... " The Chief Justice inquired if after the expiration of two and one-half years the climate of opinion had not changed , would the board ask for another two and one-half years ? Answered Butler : " . . . We do n't know .... " Warren inquired further : " The first decision was in 1954 . This is 1958 . Two years and a half will bring it up almost to 1961 . Now if all those Negro children are denied the right to go to integrated schools , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to get equal protection under the laws ? " Butler had no answer . Thurgood Marshall and Solicitor General Rankin took little  | time to present their position , reiterating their contentions : " This case involves the question of the maintenance of law and order not only in this community . . . but throughout this country ... . There can be no equality of justice for our people if the law steps aside even for a moment , at the command of force and violence , " said Rankin . When it was his turn Marshall said : " I am not worried about the Negro children . . . . I worry about the white children .. . who are told , as young people , that the way to get your rights is to violate the law and defy the lawful authorities . " Marshall attacked Butler 's argument that the board was caught between federal and state sovereignties . Such a conflict , he pointed out , had been resolved by the Constitution itself ; Article VI proclaimed the supremacy of the national government.14 On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation , announced without waiting for the preparation of its formal opinion : " The Court . . . is unanimously " ? and when the Chief Justice read out these words he paused and looked up to emphasize the Court 's unanimity ? " of the opinion that the judgment of the Court of Appeals . . . must be affirmed . ... The expression of the views supporting our judgment will be prepared and announced in due course . . . . The judgment of this Court shall be effective immediately , and shall be communicated forthwith to the District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas . " Little Rock 's desegregation program was in effect once more . Two weeks later the Supreme Court released its supporting opinion . The Court reaffirmed its decision against segregation in a blunt , forceful , and powerfully written opinion . The Court mentioned no psychologists or sociologists , but based its rulings squarely on judicial precedents . Many civil rights advocates wished that the Court had been as forceful in 1954 . This opinion was signed individually by each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accentuate the  | justices ' unanimity and determination . The Court emphasized : " Since the first Brown opinion , three new Justices have come to the Court . They are at one with the Justices still on the Court who participated in that basic decision as to its correctness , and that decision is now unanimously reaffirmed . " The Court minced no words in accusing Faubus and the Arkansas legislature of causing the disorder at Central High . " The constitutional rights of respondents , " said the Court , " are not to be sacrificed or yielded to the violence and disorder which have followed upon the actions of the Governor and Legislature . ... Law and order are not here to be preserved by depriving the Negro children of their constitutional rights . " The Supreme Court recalled some elementary constitutional propositions in order to answer Faubus , who had been contending that he had no obligation to obey the Brown decision . " The federal judiciary , " said the Supreme Court , citing the 1803 precedent of Marbury v. Madison , " is supreme in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . The interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment enunciated by this Court in the Brown case is the supreme law of the land . . . . Every state legislator and executive and judicial officer is solemnly committed by oath ... to support this Constitution . . . . No state ... officer can war against the Constitution without violating his undertaking to support it . . . . A governor who asserts a power to nullify a federal court order is similarly restrained . " The Court commented that a state could not avoid its constitutional duty to operate desegregated public schools by operating them behind the facade of " private institutions . " " The constitutional rights of children not to be discriminated against in school admission on grounds of race or color . . . can neither be nullified openly and directly by state legislators or state executives or judicial officers , nor nullified indirectly by them through evasive schemes for segregation attempted ingeniously or ingenuously . '  | Justice Frankfurter filed a concurring opinion in which he pointed out even more bluntly that to have granted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow to force . To yield to such a claim would be to enthrone official lawlessness . ... For those in authority thus to defy the law of the land is profoundly subversive not only of our constitutional system but to the presuppositions of a democratic society . " The Supreme Court 's words contrast with its more gentle tone of 1954 and 1955 . Earlier the Court had tried to soften the blow , to tender to southerners the right to desegregate gradually , to indicate that they could decide for themselves how to accomplish the abolition of segregation . By its moderateness the Court hoped to encourage the co-operation of southern leaders . By 1958 the Court was no longer so soft-spoken . The Supreme Court 's more aggressive tone apparently prompted the Department of Justice to take a more positive role than it had in 1957 ; when schools opened then federal authorities had no plans to deal with persons , public or private , who defied the federal courts . But by the time Little Rock 's schools were scheduled to open in 1958 , Attorney General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicly promised to help the board . More than one hundred deputy marshals would be assigned if they were needed . And in Little Rock itself civic officials strengthened their police force and prepared to prevent disorder.16 With city and national authorities united , and faced by a determined judiciary , Faubus had to play his cards differently . He had one final card to play .  | Even before the Supreme Court 's decision in the Brown case , South Carolina 's constitution had been amended to allow the legislature to abolish public schools if integration were imminent . Other states enacted similar measures . Details of these plans vary : some cut off funds to schools which desegregate ; some automatically close any " white " school to which a Negro has been assigned ; in North Carolina , and in Virginia since 1959 , the closing of public schools in districts where a court has called for integration is a local option ; in Alabama and South Carolina there is no such choice ? the legislature is in control . As far as the national Constitution is concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the Constitution requires , as presently construed , is that a state operate its public schools without respect to race . The more ardent segregationists are prepared to take the drastic step of abolishing public schools altogether , but except in the Black Belt this is a higher price than most citizens are willto pay , especially since all they have to do in order to comply with judicial decrees is to admit a few selected Negro students to " white " institutions . To avoid the political pressures generated by a complete shut- down of schools , segregationists had hoped to operate public schools but to pretend they were " private . " When this prospect failed , they sought to close only those schools to which Negroes were admitted . In some states the plans called for a closing not only of the " white " schools to which Negroes are assigned , but also the " colored " schools from which they had come . Segregationists knew that such a threat , especially to shut down the " colored " schools , would have particular meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the few professions open to middle-class Negroes . Segregationists also felt that " only a few school closings would be needed to show the country at large the depth of their determination to stand for a principle . " The Richmond News Leader editorialized : " With ingenuity and determination on the part of parents , such closings could be kept to a minimum and educational opportunities could be provided for affected children . " The Constitution does not obligate private schools to desegregate ; however , any form of governmental aid to such schools makes them subject to the prohibition against segregation . Nor can a state close just a few schools while others remain in operation if the purpose is to avoid desegregation . Students , white or black , shut out of a school that a judge has ordered to desegregate are being denied their constitutional rights . Many segregation leaders knew that these programs to operate " public-private " schools or to close down institutions to avoid integration were unconstitutional , but they had counted on being able to force time-consuming legal tests . As soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in details were to be put into operation , and another delaying lawsuit would be underway . But the Supreme Court 's Little Rock decision had caused a stiffening of judicial attitudes up and down the line . It had taken  | three years for federal judges to call a halt to the use of the pretext of violence to avoid judicial decrees ; nevertheless , these judges aggressively and quickly set aside " public-private " school schemes and school-closing programs . By 1961 when Governor S. Ernest Vandiver of Georgia tried to close the University of Georgia to avoid its desegregation , Judge Bootle issued a restraining order even before the governor could sign the proclamation . Segregationists also guessed wrong about the political consequences of their programs . Not content with forcing rural schools to close , they also tried to compel city schools to do so , and thereby generated the first major political force in support of token integration . Instead of putting pressure on the moderates , the threat of schools closing intensified the conflict between city moderates and rural segregationists , to the disadvantage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loss of their schools . But when the alternative clearly became token integration or no schools , leaders discovered it was no longer politically dangerous to champion token integration . Every city in which the segregationists forced a showdown produced for the first time a moderate organization ? the Committee on Public Education in Virginia , the Stop This Outrageous Purge Committee in Little Rock , the Help Our Public Education in Atlanta , the Save Our Schools in New Orleans . On the day on which the Supreme Court reinstated Little Rock 's desegregation program , Governor Faubus , invoking laws rushed through the legislature , issued a proclamation closing all the city 's high schools : " I have determined that domestic violence within the Little Rock School District is impending . " A special election was called in which the citizens were to vote for or against integration of all the city 's schools . Faubus promised the voters that if they would reject integration , he would arrange for the Little Rock Private School Corporation , which had just been chartered , to take over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had pledged state funds for these  | " private " schools , and the citizens could have tax-supported segregated schools , Faubus said . Sixty-three of the city 's most prominent attorneys pointed out in full-page advertisements that this scheme was patently unconstitutional . Faubus was aware that his subterfuge would be put to a court test , but it might take months , perhaps years , before a final judgment could be rendered . Judge Davies had returned to North Dakota and there was still no resident district judge . The initial challenge would be before Judge John Miller , whose past performances inspired confidence among segregationists . If the state could convert the public schools into private schools before the Negro plaintiffs secured a judicial hearing , it could open the schools and present the judge with a fait accompli . If the schools were placed under private operation prior to the referendum a more convincing case could be made that the scheme would work . Faubus publicly called on the School Board " to demonstrate their good faith " by handing over immediate control of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to Faubus 's anger , refused to do so without first asking the federal court for instructions . It went before Judge John Miller stating frankly that they would lease the public schools to the corporation if they would not be subjecting themselves to charges of contempt . Miller denied the petition for instructions on the ground it would be improper to render an advisory opinion , but nothing he said suggested to the board that it would get in trouble if it turned over schools to the segregationists.3 Two days before the referendum , Negro students who had been closed out of Central High asked Judge Miller for an immediate restraining order to keep the board from co-operating with the Private School Corporation . Attorneys for the Negro students and the Department of Justice , which supported their petition , argued that unless Judge Miller issued a restraining order , the leases would be executed , private schools would be  | opened , Negro students would be left out in the cold , and the court 's own mandates would be rendered useless . Judge Miller , who heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1941 . He had been a member of Congress from 1931 to 1939 and had been elected to the Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Senator Joseph T. Robinson . A favorite of Senator McClellan , Judge Miller made no secret of his own feelings . He told the Sebastian County Bar Association , " Judges must speak for the will of the people , " and he criticized " some of the appellate courts " for an " inclination .. . to arrogate unto themselves the power to declare for us certain standards contrary to the mores . . . which have existed for centuries in this country . " Earlier in September 1958 Judge Miller had refused to give the NAACP any help in putting down a student strike keeping Negroes out of Van Buren High School . Judge Miller had said he was not going to be " rushed off my feet in this matter . Suppose a person is denied a right for a few days . He would n't be the first person whose rights have been denied for a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no great harm done . " It was not surprising , therefore , that Judge Miller denied the NAACP 's and the Department of Justice 's request to restrain the school board from handing over schools to the corporation . " I have always been opposed to precipitant action by a court , " he said . He explained that the three-judge court would be required to issue such a restraining order ; he refused to issue an order to maintain the status quo until a three-judge court could be convened for a hearing . Even if a three-judge court were required , which it was not , Judge Miller could have issued a restraining order until such a court could have been assembled . The plaintiffs were not asking him to enjoin the enforcement of state laws , which does require  | three judges . They were asking only that he keep the school board from co-operating in an unconstitutional maneuver . As the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit subsequently said : " They the school authorities were simply yielding to the local desire or clamor and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thwart integration ? the thing which board members were under judicial mandate to use their efforts and powers to achieve . " At the moment , however , Judge Miller 's ruling left the board free to proceed . It helped to convince the citizens of Little Rock that Faubus could carry his program into effect without judicial interference . It stripped the school board of any excuse for not co-operating with Faubus . On September 27 the citizens of Little Rock went to the polls . They were given a ballot worded in such a way as to give them a choice between complete segregation or complete integration of all schools in the district . A majority of all registered voters , not merely a majority of those voting , was required before public schools could be opened ? an almost certain guarantee of a segregationist victory . Yet Faubus 's precautions were unnecessary ; the vote was 19,470 to 7,561 against integration . That evening the Private School Corporation opened negotiations with the school board . The NAACP had to act quickly if it were going to appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the court of appeals . Under the rules of the Eighth Circuit , two judges are required to hear applications for restraining orders . The court of appeals was in recess , but there were two circuit justices resident in Omaha , Nebraska . The first opportunity the NAACP attorneys would have to secure a hearing would be at 10 o'clock on Monday morning , September 29 . They intended to be at the judges ' doors when they opened . The corporation , with Faubus 's full backing , went into allnight session with the school board , which at 1:30 A.M. on Sep- tember 29 capitulated and agreed to lease the buildings before the NAACP could present its case to the circuit judges . The formal signing took place at 8:30 A.M. , an hour and a half before court opened in Omaha . It was announced that high schools would open immediately . They would be " private " schools and they would be segregated . The strategy failed . In Washington , D.C. , at the very hour when the circuit judges were convening in Omaha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rock case . The Supreme Court stated : " State support of segregated schools through any arrangement , management , funds , or property can not be squared with the Amendment 's the Fourteenth command . " Government lawyers in Washington dashed to the phone and read the Supreme Court 's words to a stenographer in Omaha , who rushed them to the chambers of the circuit judges . It did not take the circuit judges long to issue a restraining order . The order was wired to Little Rock . More than one hundred marshals immediately served it on all members of the school board , all teachers , and all staff officials . A state trooper refused to allow Faubus to be served personally . The next morning the high schools stayed closed . The Court 's critics were quick to point out that the issue of publicly supported private schools had not been presented to the Supreme Court by the Little Rock ruling of Judge Lemley . Therefore , the Supreme Court 's dictum that the use of public funds to operate segregated private schools is unconstitutional , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Supreme Court 's defenders responded that the Court 's boldness conformed to long-established practice and that a more timid judicial attitude would have played right into the hands of those trying to evade the Constitution . The court of appeals told Judge Miller that he should insist on the board 's taking " affirmative steps " toward carrying out the previously planned program of integration . The school board , the circuit judges pointed out , had a legal duty to act positively .  | Judge Miller was on his vacation when these instructions were issued in November 1958 . " I wo n't be back home for a week , " he said , " and I ca n't do anything about it until I get home . " 8 It was not until January 1959 that Miller finally acted . He gave the board ? newly reconstituted after the fall elections and evenly divided between three moderates and three segregationists ? thirty days to report to him on what it " had done and was planning to do " to desegregate . Eleven days later the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Judge Miller , " With some schools closed and with the air of tenseness encompassing the whole school district . . . it is impossible . . . to carry into effect the so-called Blossom Plan . ' " The only thing they could do would be to reopen the high schools on a segregated basis . If the judge would permit them to do this , they promised to hire experts and to develop new desegregation plans . Attorneys for the plaintiffs objected strongly . " The relief now sought by the defendants , " they said , " raises the same issues which were disposed of " when the board sought a " temporary delay " in 1958 . Government lawyers , still participating in the case , pointed out that board members , instead of taking affirmative action to carry out the integration plan as they had been ordered to do , were acting " in bad faith " to avoid their obligation . They should be cited for contempt unless they immediately proceeded with the approved plan.9 Judge Miller , cautious as always , refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools , but he ruled board members had acted in good faith . He said that as long as Faubus kept the schools closed , the board 's only duty was to sit tight . In short the court of appeals ' mandate that the board should take affirmative steps was construed by Judge Miller to mean that the board take no negative steps.10 Clearly Judge Miller was going to be of little help to the 8 New York Times , November 11 , 1958. 9 Aaron v. Cooper , 4 RRLR 17 ( 1959 ) ; see A.P . dispatch , January 21 , 1959.  | moderates . If they were going to regain control of their schools they would have to do so by political rather than legal victories . This was to take time . In the fall it seemed as if Faubus would be able to provide a substitute for the public high schools . For a while most of the people appeared content with the substitute minimal education being provided for white students . Faubus continued to find overwhelming support in Little Rock . Schools were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the people that it was the federal judges who had deprived them of their high schools . Back in November 1958 , after the only segregationist member of the school board , Dr. Dale Alford , a dentist , defeated the nationally respected Brooks Hays in an upset write-in campaign for Congress , the five other members of the school board had resigned . Faubus seemed invincible . He had won an unprecedented third term . Jim Johnson , a bitter-end segregationist , was elected to the Arkansas Supreme Court . The members of the school board felt they had tried to do their job but without support from the community , the district court , or the President . Because they were afraid that the board to be elected in December would not treat Blossom fairly , as their last act the resigning board members paid up Blossom 's contract . This was the high point of Faubus 's influence in Little Rock . From then on , slowly but gradually , moderates began to pick up political support . In December three candidates backed by the citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were three moderates . The Private School Corporation , after being blocked from taking over the public schools , leased other buildings and operated a private school ; so did various churches . Faubus 's plan to divert public funds to the Private School Corporation was blocked by a three-judge federal court ( Sanborn , Beck , and Miller ) which ordered Arkansas to cease paying tuition for students attending private segregated schools.11 Deprived of public school buildings  | and unable to use publicly paid teachers or state funds , the Private School Corporation had to depend on private contributions . Faubus did his best to help ? on official stationery he sent a letter to thousands of people requesting contributions . But the inadequacy of these makeshift educational arrangements became more and more obvious as the school year progressed . By the end of the term , the corporation was bankrupt.12 Little Rock 's economy was suffering . Home building had declined since 1957 by 20 per cent ; between 1950 and September 1957 forty new plants had come to Little Rock , but since then there had been none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in population ? one among every five professional persons wanted to or was planning to leave the city.l3 One Arkansas businessman complained : " The rest of the South tells us , Fight to the last ditch . . . ' but their high schools are not closed . I say to hell with it . " 14 The Little Rock Chamber of Commerce polled its members on February 23 : they voted 819 to 245 in favor of reopening the high schools " on a controlled minimum plan of integration acceptable to the Federal Courts . " In large advertisements the Chamber of Commerce told Little Rock citizens : " The decision of the Supreme Court of the United States , however much we dislike it , is the declared law and it is binding upon us . We think the decision was erroneous ... but we must in honesty recognize that , because the Supreme Court is the court of last resort in this country , what it has said must stand until there is a correcting constitutional amendment or until the Court corrects its own error . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court . We should not delude ourselves about that . " The Little Rock Chapter of the American Association of University Women in January 1959 asked eighty-five businessmen if their business had been hurt by the school dispute ; forty-four said their business had  | Earlier , in the December 1958 school board elections , Faubus had come close to capturing control of the board when three of his men were elected . But because moderates held the other three positions , in the 1959 session of the Arkansas General Assembly Faubus proposed that he be empowered to appoint three additional members of the Little Rock board . The legislature refused ; it was Faubus 's first defeat . To that moment the Arkansas General Assembly had docilely passed any law Faubus had wanted , it did n't matter how extreme or unconstitutional , so long as it promised to keep segregation . Early in May the three moderate members of the board walked out of a meeting in an attempt to dissolve a quorum . The three Faubus men seized the opportunity . They fired fortyfour teachers , including some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeded to hire as superintendent T. H. Alford , father of Congressman Afford . This purge gave the moderates just the kind of issue they needed . Up to that moment they had been unable to rally much support behind token integration , but now they could counterattack against this arbitrary dismissal of teachers . That very night the Little Rock PTA Council , which had tried to stay on the fence , issued a fighting statement calling for the recall of the three segregationist board members . A recall election was possible because of a 1957 law , sponsored by Faubus , and passed as a threat to the moderates who then controlled the board . During the week there was one PTA meeting after another . One hundred and seventy-nine of Little Rock 's most prominent business and civic leaders organized a Committee to Stop This been hurt ; thirty-five said they had noticed no effect ; six said their business had improved . One company president said , " Anyone who does n't think the school situation will affect his business adversely has rocks in his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business had been hurt . Others who said that business had declined were pharmacists , manufacturers , and variety store owners . Retail store owners , insurance men , and bankers said they could see no impact . Two of the three moving-van owners said their business had improved . Governor Faubus disputed the significance of these findings .  | Outrageous Purge ( STOP ) . Although STOP deliberately avoided taking a stand on integration , the issue was clearly joined . Everett Tucker , Jr. , vice president of the board and spokesman for the moderates , told crowds jammed into school auditoriums : " We are faced with two alternatives ? some degree of integration in the public schools , or segregation and no public schools at all . " He advocated the former . He drew applause ? for the first time since Faubus had intervened a white audience in Little Rock cheered a moderate who advocated token integration.16 Segregationists counterattacked with the Committee to Regain Our Segregated Schools ( CROSS ) ; they filed petitions to recall the moderates . During the next thirty days each side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , TV , mass meetings , and speeches . STOP insisted the issue was the firing of forty-four teachers without notice or hearing ; CROSS insisted the issue was segregation versus integration . Faubus threw his support to CROSS and took to television . STOP deliberately refrained from co-operating with the Negroes of Little Rock . Yet segregationists circulated invitations purportedly put out by STOP which invited Negroes to a rally . CROSS then made its worst tactical error : it accused the fortyfour dismissed teachers of " teaching alien doctrines , incompetence , intimidation of students , and immorality . " On May 25 there was a heavy vote in the recall election . Faubus lost for the first time since 1957 . The margin was close but all three of the segregationist board members were recalled ; all three of the moderates were retained . Faubus termed it a temporary skirmish , but at the next school board election , December 1959 , moderates trounced the segregationists . The political winds were shifting . Judge Miller , joined by two other federal judges , in June 1959 ruled : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public high schools in Little Rock was and is void . " The judges reminded the board : " defendants are permanently enjoined from engaging in any acts  | which will , directly or indirectly , impede , thwart , delay , or frustrate the execution of the approved plans for the gradual integration of the schools of Little Rock . " 17 The Faubus program had been declared unconstitutional . The Supreme Court of Arkansas had been of little help . By four to three in April 1959 it had sustained Faubus 's closing of the schools . The decision of the Arkansas court had no legal significance in the face of the contrary federal decisions , but politically it served to confuse the situation . Perhaps of greatest significance , however , was the fact that even three Arkansas Supreme Court jurists had ruled against Faubus . With the increased political backing , the Little Rock board prepared to reopen high schools when the 1959 fall semester began . The board used the pupil-assignment law to limit the number of Negroes , originally assigning a single Negro student to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none to the Technical High . After eighteen other Negroes asked for reassignment , one more was assigned to Central High and three to Hall . Under the board 's original assignment a lone teen-age Negro student would have had to face a year in isolation in Central High ; most of those Negro students who had gone through the 1957 ? 58 year at Central were assigned to the " colored " school . It was prudent of the board , however , to avoid sending Negro students to Technical High , where segregation strength could be expected to be especially strong since Technical enrolled noncollege-bound students , and it was wise to send some Negroes to Hall High , which served a predominantly middle-class neighborhood . If there were to have been only one integrated high , Hall ? more than Central ? would have been a better choice ; it served more economically prosperous constituents , among whom segregationist sentiment was less widespread and less virulent . Negroes assigned to Hall High have had much more pleasant experience than those who attend Central . Little Rock Chief of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ v. Cooper , 4 RRLR 543 at 550 ( 1959 ) .  | was determined to keep segregationists from creating a turmoil , so that the governor would not have an excuse to intervene ; Smith let it be known that he had the force ready and would tolerate no demonstrations . Faubus continued to predict violence and to describe Little Rock officials as tools of the NAACP , but before he could interfere , the school board abruptly reopened schools a month early . The night before schools opened the governor , in a television address , criticized the " integrationist federal puppets " and the Little Rock police . He warned that he would move in the State Police and the National Guard if the Little Rock police could not control the situation . But he told his followers , " I see nothing to be gained . . . by disorder and violence . " The next morning , before schools opened , he advised one thousand segregationists who rallied on the capitol steps : " I see no reasons for you to be beaten over the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only as a last resort , and when there is much to be gained . " Several hundred of the most determined segregationists , many from out of town , marched on to Central High . In the forefront were Mrs. Alford , the wife of the Congressman , and her children . As they approached Central High , Chief Smith , using a portable electric megaphone , told them : " Your behavior is a disgraceful matter . . . let 's get out of the streets . " Y0 But on they marched . Fire hoses were turned on ; the police arrested twenty-one persons and the demonstrators were dispersed . The riot was over . Faubus accused the Little Rock police of using Gestapo tactics . He compared Chief Smith to Janos Kadar , the Hungarian puppet , and he charged that Smith " went out and arrested and beat people . " At Central High School officials were dealing more severely with troublemakers . Any student taking overt hostile action  | against the Negro students was punished . Within a brief period , the school year was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to school in fear ; their parents still wondered whether their children would return safely . But at least the community was no longer standing idly by . Law , order , and ordinary school operations were gradually restored . Faubusism was still strong in Arkansas , as the fourth-term gubernatorial victory of 1960 demonstrated , but the magic was gone ; Little Rock authorities were no longer afraid of their governor . Senator J. W. Fulbright , who to that moment had said nothing about the Little Rock school crisis ( his timidity had much to do with President Kennedy 's decision not to offer him a position as Secretary of State ) , finally declared that Faubus had mishandled the situation . Even the Arkansas Supreme Court responded to the changing climate ; in September 1959 , it unanimously made its first antisegregation ruling when it struck down the State Sovereignty Commission , a commission established to investigate the NAACP . Desegregation is underway in Little Rock , but not because of the federal district judges . The judges followed the path of least resistance and provided no leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of pressure . In Virginia it was a different story . Virginia 's federal judges were slower than their brethren in Arkansas to crack down on segregation , but after the decisions were made , the Virginia jurists insisted on compliance . At first it appeared that the federal judges would have the widespread backing of the political forces in Virginia and that the Commonwealth would place itself in the camp of the moderates . Following the 1954 Brown decision , Governor Stanley appointed a commission , which in the fall of 1955 recommended a program , based primarily upon local option . The Gray Plan , 22 named for the commission 's chairman , 22 Public Education , Report of the Commission to the Governor of Virginia , Senate Document No. 1 , Commonwealth of Virginia , Richmond , 1955.  | Senator Garland Gray , took into account the fact that in northern Virginia many cities could and would easily desegregate , that in Southside Virginia it would be difficult to do so , and that the Piedmont and Southeast sections would fall somewhere in between . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own desegregation program . Tuition grants were to be made available to send to private schools children whose parents objected to sending them to integrated public schools . Governor Stanley called the Virginia legislature into emergency session . By narrow vote the legislature proposed an amendment to the Constitution to permit the tuition grants . Virginia moderates opposed this amendment , charging that the tuition program was a device to undermine the public schools . " Our school system , " they wrote , " can not stand half public and half private . " 23 Despite their support for a pupil-assignment law as the best plan to keep integration under control , they emphasized that total segregation in all parts of Virginia could not be secured forever . Early in 1956 the Gray Plan was endorsed by the voters , two to one . The votes had hardly been counted when there was a noticeable lessening of enthusiasm by state officials for the plan . Southside segregationists , flushed by their victory in defeating the moderates , were demanding that Governor Stanley repudiate the Gray Plan in favor of total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way . Virginia is dominated by a single political organization . The Democrats win all the state-wide elections and the Byrd organization wins most of the primaries . When Senator Harry Flood Byrd came out for " massive resistance , " the Gray Plan was dead . Governor Stanley repudiated it . So did Senator Gray himself . By a slim margin , a special session of the Virginia General Assembly adopted thirteen laws to rivet segregation on all communities . The power to assign pupils to schools was taken from the local school boards and vested in a state-wide three-man  | Pupil Placement Board . The board 's instructions and the governor 's control over its personnel assured that no Negro would ever be assigned to a " white " school . Furthermore , if any judge should order a Negro admitted to a " white " school , it was to be closed automatically with control over the school taken from the board of education and vested in the governor . In 1957 the Democratic candidate for governor was Lindsay Almond , Jr. , the attorney general who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school-entry suits . He was opposed by Ted Dalton , who in 1953 had come close to defeating Stanley by garnering 45 per cent of the popular vote . The major issue in the 1957 Dalton-Almond campaign was massive resistance . Dalton predicted massive resistance would not withstand legal assault , and argued for local option . In the midst of the campaign Judge Walter Hoffman declared Virginia 's pupilplacement law unconstitutional . Dalton called for an emergency session of the legislature , contending that the court 's decision marked the beginning of the end for massive resistance . The Byrd organization went down the line for Almond and massive resistance and , after President Eisenhower 's dispatch of federal troops to Little Rock , Dalton 's defeat was sealed . " The shock of that incident , which was exploited to the full by Democratic campaigners , had a devastating effect upon the Republican effort in Virginia . " The NAACP now mounted a massive legal attack ; more lawsuits were filed in Virginia and pushed with greater vigor than in any other state . Virginia 's lack of guile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for there was only the slightest pretense that state officials were acting in good faith . The only hope segregationists had was that the United States district judges would refuse to take judicial notice of the purpose and impact of the several anti-integration laws , considering each law in isolation and taking each at its face value . Segrega24 Benjamin Muse , Virginia 's Massive Resistance , Bloomington : Indiana University Press , 1961 , p. 44 ; Richmond News Leader , October 23 , 1957.  | tionists wanted the judges to assume , for example , that the placement board would not discriminate against Negroes , and that the threat to close integrated schools was not designed to keep them segregated . Virginia 's leaders said they were preparing to desegregate but needed more time , lots of it . But with one exception , the district judges were unwilling to ignore the obvious purpose , design , and intentions of the massive resistance laws . Judge John Paul of the Western District of Virginia , holding court in Harrisonburg , handled the Charlottesville and Warren County cases . Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ted Dalton ) is a seventy-five-year-old , alert , quick-moving , snap-jawed , and decisive man . The son of a distinguished Republican , he had followed his father 's steps through service in the Virginia Senate , the United States House of Representatives , and to the same federal court . Judge Paul 's appointment to the bench by President Hoover in 1931 did not affect his willingness to speak frankly . He opposed prohibition . Months before Pearl Harbor he urged American intervention to prevent the Axis powers from consolidating their strength . In 1937 he told the Richmond Bar Association : The States . . . have allowed their water power and other natural resources to be exploited until it was necessary for the national government to step in . . . . We may say the same regarding child labor , lynching and other evils . . . . The states would not legislate . . . .

I absolve you from any participation in that policy , Mr. Attorney General Almond ... but I am not willing that this Court should be a knowing and conscious accessary to a program which has for its purpose delay and evasion of the decree of the Supreme Court of the United States . " Judge Paul 's fellow judge , Walter E. Hoffman , of the Eastern District , who presides over the Norfolk and Newport News cases , is no less forthright . Hoffman became a federal judge in September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for attorney general . Judge Hoffman , a big man nicknamed " Beef , " was one of Eisenhower 's first boosters . He was supported for his position by the Republican Virginia Patronage Committee and the then Republican national committeeman , Dalton . Senator Byrd pointed out he had nothing to do with the recommendation but said " I had no reason to object to his confirmation . " On the day Attorney General Almond announced his candidacy for governor , he was arguing the Norfolk case before Judge Hoffman . When the Virginia laws requiring closing of schools were referred to , Judge Hoffman said , " What the legislature of Virginia did in Richmond was not too much to the credit of good judgment . It may have been politically wise . " 27 Judge Hoffman 's bluntness and his open criticism of Virginia Democratic leaders have made him one of the major verbal targets of segregationists . Senator Byrd charged Judge Hoffman with " ungoverned prejudice . " Hoffman refused to yield . " When I took this job , " he said , " I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a public park ? and when you get the volume of mail you get after one of those decisions , you wonder whether you are going to live another day .

I will be here until I die . " 29 On another occasion he said : " I understand some of the leaders of Virginia have said they would like to see whether a federal judge has the nerve enough to punish for contempt , and I can assure you that the order will have to be complied with . " J0 Judge Albert V. Bryan , who presides over the United States District Court for Northern Virginia sitting in Alexandria , has heard both the Arlington and Alexandria cases . Judge Bryan was nominated in 1947 by President Truman from a list of names presented by Senators Byrd and A. Willis Robertson and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he is known , is chairman of the Rules Committee of the House of Representatives , a determined foe of civil rights legislation , and leader of the southern Democrats in the House . It was he with whom Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn duelled and won , in the contest in early 1961 to enlarge the Rules Committee to prevent further obstruction of liberal legislation by the Committee 's former coalition of southern Democrats and conservative Republicans . Judge Bryan is an old-fashioned-looking judge with steelrimmed glasses , who has a reputation for being meticulously just . He permitted Arlington to delay for six months in September 1958 , and , until reversed by the court of appeals , allowed school officials to subject Negroes to special tests ; nevertheless , the general thrust of his work has been toward compliance . A former member of the Byrd organization and more guarded in his comments than his two Republican colleagues , Paul and Hoffman , Judge Bryan has been less exposed to political criticism . The fourth district judge to become deeply involved in desegregation litigation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ District until his retirement on September 1 , 1959 . Judge Hutcheson comes from Southside Vir- ginia . For eleven years he served as United States district attorney , upon the recommendation of Senators Byrd and Carter Glass , and was promoted to the bench in 1944 . He is the son of a prominent Democratic leader and cousin of Circuit Judge Joseph C. Hutcheson , Jr. , of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit . Judge Sterling Hutcheson sticks pretty close to his business and seldom comments on any subjects outside of his court . In 1948 Judge Hutcheson fined the Gloucester County School Board and its superintendent $250 for contempt after he found they had failed to carry out an order to equalize the Negro public schools.31 In 1956 and 1958 , however , he refused to require Prince Edward County to desegregate . He criticized his judicial superiors mildly for failing to understand properly the special situation of rural Black Belt communities . By the time schools opened in 1958 Virginia had worn out the last strand of its legal rope . Norfolk , Newport News @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all were under court order to admit Negroes to " white " schools . In some of these cities the litigation had taken three years . Although Arlington , Alexandria , and Newport News were able to delay once again the effective date of their respective orders , in the other cities the judges refused to back down . As a final resort Governor Almond closed the schools to keep Negroes from being assigned . By the end of September about thirteen thousand children were locked out of nine schools in Norfolk , Charlottesville , and Warren County . Various substitute educational arrangements were made . In Warren County and Charlottesville private educational foundations operated classes for white students . In Norfolk the teachers , led by Superintendent H. E. Brewbaker , refused to participate in these ad hoc programs for fear that the parents would be misled into thinking their children were getting an adequate education . Battle lines were quickly drawn . Committees to Preserve the Public Schools took over the leadership of the moderate forces .  | These committees drew the bulk of their membership from the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the northern part of the state . Persons in urban communities knew that through judicious juggling of school lines and through use of pupil placement , they could contain integration so that it would make little difference to the actual operation of their schools . Though they favored segregation they were not prepared to give up so much to gain so little . The Defenders of State Sovereignty and Individual Liberties headed the segregation forces , with the bulk of their strength coming from the southern part of the state . In rural areas where there is but a single high school and where the white-Negro ratio approaches 50 per cent , desegregation of the high school would make a much more significant change . But the Defenders were fighting to prevent integration not only in rural communities but in the cities as well . The Virginia PTA Convention held in Richmond early in October provided the first battleground . Governor Almond made a fighting , uncompromising speech . He called on the people to rally behind the massive resistance program and to show their determination to avoid integration . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned back an attempt by William I. McKendree , president of the Norfolk PTA Council and a charter member of the Defenders , to take over the state PTA organization . A resolution , endorsing the state 's stand , was defeated by a tie vote and another , supporting local option , was carried 515 to 513.32 ( As an indication of how rapidly the political situation can change , the PTA a year later snowed under a segregation resolution.33 ) Six thousand Norfolk parents asked the governor to reopen the schools.34 So did Superintendent Brewbaker and the teachers.35  | And so did many business leaders , concerned that the city might lose its major industry , the United States Naval installation , and the federal 1.3 million dollar annual subsidy to help educate the children of federal employees . The same kind of counterpressures were generated in Charlottesville and Arlington . The pressure on the governor was not all one-sided . Senator Byrd himself called on the governor to stand fast . Southside Virginia reminded Almond of his campaign promises to stand by massive resistance . The Norfolk City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called for a public referendum in which the voters were asked if they wanted the high schools to be reopened without state aid , with parents paying " a substantial tuition . " By 3 to 2 the voters in the referendum advised against the opening of the schools under these terms . Each side hailed the vote as a victory : moderates charged the ballot had misled the voters , that many of the young parents recently arrived in the city had not been qualified to vote , and that even under these adverse circumstances the referendum indicated considerable community opposition to closing the schools . The segregationists claimed the referendum proved that the citizens of Norfolk were willing to do without public schools if necessary to stand up for their principles . Governor Almond was in a tight spot . He had the strong backing of the Byrd organization , of Virginia 's Fourth and Fifth Congressional Districts , embracing Southside , and had championed massive resistance in his campaign . On the other hand , though a convinced segregationist , he was an excellent lawyer with a profound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close the Negro high schools ; under Virginia 's laws the only schools shut were the " white " high schools . Almond refused.36 At no time did he give the slightest encouragement to street agitators . He and all of Virginia 's leaders , except for a few from the Southside , were determined to avoid violence . By the  | fall of 1959 it was clear to the governor that further obstruction could only lead to chaos , yet to abandon massive resistance required some advanced political and legal preparations . On November 11 a trial balloon was launched . James J. Kilpatrick , editor of the Richmond News Leader , confidant of the governor , and the most articulate defender of states ' rights , told the Richmond Rotary Club : " I believe the time has come for new weapons and new tactics . I believe the laws we now have on the books have outlived their usefulness , and I believe that new laws must be devised ? speedily devised ? if educational opportunities are to be preserved and social calamity is to be avoided . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the massive resistance and proposed that each community be given a free choice . Senator Byrd insisted that the people of Virginia would never accept integrated schools anywhere in the state . But within a week every major metropolitan newspaper in Virginia was calling for a change in tactics . All had shifted their editorial policy to an endorsement of local option.37 The pressures on Almond intensified . Twenty-five of the top Virginia industrial leaders warned him of the damaging economic effect of massive resistance and threatened to withdraw their support if he continued to insist upon it.38 Almond needed a graceful way to abandon the program he had so strongly supported in the recent campaign . The courts could give it to him . The day after Kilpatrick made his speech , Governor Almond announced the appointment of a commission to study the antiintegration laws in the event they were declared illegal . He instructed the attorney general to arrange a test case before the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals . " I fully realize , " said Almond , " I am in the jaws of a vise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia as long as they are vital . " 39 Clearly , here  | was an invitation to the judges to help Virginia get out of the vise , and incidentally to extricate Almond . While the governor was arranging for the massive resistance laws to be challenged before the state supreme court , numerous white children and their parents filed suit in the federal district court attacking the massive resistance program . By a " coincidence , " the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals and the United States special three-man district court ( Circuit Judges Sobeloff and Haynsworth and District Judge Hoffman ) handed down their decisions on January 19 . Both declared Virginia 's school-closing laws unconstitutional . The governor had his " out , " but he found it emotionally difficult nonetheless to jettison massive resistance . The day after the courts declared the Commonwealth 's massive resistance program unconstitutional , Almond made a state-wide radio address , still talking the language of defiance . But Almond explained later : " I was tired , harassed , and under strain , and I wanted to reassure the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with honor and law , to avoid that which I then considered , and now consider , a calamity . My words inadvertently gave the impression that I knew of some way to prevent any mixing of the races in the public schools , when nothing of the sort was possible . " 40 The governor called the General Assembly into emergency session . He proposed that the state repeal its massive resistance program , that compulsory attendance laws be abolished , that $250 tuition grants be made to any parent who wished to transfer his child from a public integrated school to a private one , and that a forty-man commission be created to study future policy . The embittered core of segregationists fought back with nothing to offer except outright defiance of federal courts and complete abandonment of public schools . The legislature , however , supported Almond . In Norfolk , with its large sprinkling of northerners , and in Arlington and Alexandria in the shadow of the  | nation 's capitol , the old order passed quickly and quietly . A few mopping-up injunctions were required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the about-to-be-integrated high schools , but an era of token integration had begun . Only in Prince Edward County have Virginians chosen to abandon public education rather than to comply with a court desegregation order . This rural county , of which the county seat is appropriately called Farmville , consists of fifteen thousand Negroes and fifteen thousand whites , including Robert B. Crawford , president of the Virginia Defenders . Prince Edward was one of the original cases heard by the Supreme Court . In 1955 , immediately after the Supreme Court ruled that segregation is unconstitutional , the county fathers created a private school system ready to be activated if integration could not be avoided . The board of supervisors , which supplies the funds for local schools , started to finance schools on a month-to-month basis ; public school teachers were signed up by the private Prince Edward Educational Corporation ; textbooks and desks were purchased ; lodge halls and churches were made ready to be converted into classrooms ; and $300,000 was pledged to support these schools . The chance that Prince Edward would be compelled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " stood behind the barricade of a state-wide massive resistance . " Judge Hutcheson , who had jurisdiction over the school suit , appeared to believe that the time had not yet arrived for integration to begin and that it would not arrive soon . It seemed unlikely , moreover , that the NAACP would force a showdown in Prince Edward County . But in the spring of 1956 , five years after the suit had been started , the Negroes of Prince Edward , speaking through the plaintiffs who represented them , asked Judge Hutcheson to fix a date by which Prince Edward should begin to desegregate . Nine months later Judge Hutcheson ruled that " in the present state of unrest and racial tension in the county it would be unwise to attempt to force a change . . . . The passage of time with apparent inaction on the part of the defendants of itself  | does not necessarily show non-compliance .... By submitting the usual budget ... they have done all that reasonably could be required of them . " Judge Hutcheson 's language forced the NAACP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that unrest and racial tension justified a school board in doing no more than submitting budgets to continue segregation . The court of appeals reversed Judge Hutcheson and ordered him to set a time limit . On August 4 , 1958 , he did ? 1965 , ten years from the 1955 Brown decision , fourteen years after the original complaint , seven more years from the time of the hearing . His ruling , furthermore , left the way open for the date to be extended beyond 1965.43 In the spring of 1959 the court of appeals ( Soper , Haynsworth , and Roby C. Thompson ) again reversed Judge Hutcheson . It said : " The proceedings of the District Court . . . and the total inaction of the School Board speak so loudly that no argument is needed to show that the last delaying order of the District Judge can not be approved , and that it has become necessary for this Court to give specific directions as to what must be done . " 43 The court directed Hutcheson to order the school board to permitimmediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " high schools in the school term beginning September 1959 . Applications for grade schools were to be considered , but the court of appeals did not order integration at this level to begin , other than " at the earliest practical date . " The court of appeals ' determined stand left Prince Edward with little choice . Though they might have used pupil placement to gain additional time , it was clear from the tone of the court of appeals ' opinion that the circuit judges were in no mood for delay . Prince Edward closed its public schools . Some white citizens of Prince Edward were deeply opposed to  | the closing of their public schools . Even a member of the school board admitted privately that the two high and six elementary schools operated by the private foundation can not give students an education comparable to that of the public schools.44 He dares not speak out publicly even now . He hopes that in time the crippling of the community which will result from the lack of educated citizenry will generate the same support for token integration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities . It seems unlikely , despite his hope , that Prince Edward 's citizens will respond to the closing of their public schools as have those in the larger cities . Prince Edward can do what a larger city can not do . The number of white children to be educated is relatively small , only around 1500 . Since the public schools which Prince Edward formerly operated were modest in their educational standards , its private schools suffer only slightly by comparison . In the setting of urban communities , these private schools might be considered makeshift , but not so in Prince Edward . In Prince Edward , segregationist political pressure is so strong that unless the federal judiciary intervenes it is unlikely that the public school system will be restored . There is a serious constitutional doubt that Virginia can permit one of its counties to abandon public education while students in other counties are provided with tax-supported institutions . Even if the federal judges support the contentions of the Negro paintiffs , there is such a wide gulf in Prince Edward between the requirements of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtful whether antisegregation judicial decrees could have any major impact . Judges can do much to speed desegregation , but they need political support from the White House , the State House , or the City Hall . Unless they have this backing they will not , perhaps can not , desegregate the schools . This is the lesson of Prince Edward .  | By the spring of 1960 , after eight years of litigation , Judge J. Skelly Wright realized that it was up to him to take the Orleans Parish School Board off the spot . He ordered the board to desegregate the first grade in the fall of 1960 . But he did not face the crisis alone : New Orleans was not to be another Little Rock with a lonely judge , a few Negro school children , and an embattled school board forced to face angry segregationists without civic support or federal assistance . " Several years ago , " said Judge Wright , " I was almost like a voice crying in the wilderness . Today we have support , substantial support , among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like what I have done , but more and more are willing to understand that it is something we must do . " 2 He was right . No school board had fought more determinedly to retain segregation than had the Orleans Parish board : they had filed thirty-six delaying motions . But after the judge 's integration order became final , four of the five elected members recognized , as Board Chairman Lloyd J. Rittiner said , " We must yield as gracefully as is possible . " 3 Only one member , Emile A. Wagner ,  | Jr. , an arch-segregationist , continued to argue " integration as required by Judge Wright would be an evil far worse than closing the schools . " 4 The school board was not alone in accepting defeat . Mayor de Lesseps S. Morrison and the responsible citizenry backed the board , as was convincingly demonstrated just a few days before desegregation was inaugurated . Matthew R. Sutherland , a moderate member of the school board , decisively defeated three other candidates , one of whom Wagner endorsed . Sutherland made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comply with Judge Wright 's order.6 Unlike those in Little Rock , moderates in New Orleans had federal support . President Eisenhower had remained aloof , even when the entire state legislature and governor defied the federal courts , but moderates were convinced that when President Kennedy took office this failure of Presidential leadership would be remedied . And from the very outset of the New Orleans crisis , President Eisenhower 's Attorney General had been an active participant . This time Attorney General Rogers did not give segregationists a chance to use violence as an excuse for interfering with desegregation or any encouragement that the Department of Justice would remain passive . He warned : " Any resistance , or obstruction or interference with federal court orders will be in violation of federal law . " 6 And he deployed a large force of federal marshals " ready to co-operate fully with city police . " ' Moderates also had the support of the Roman Catholic Church , the Church to which more than half of the white citizens of the city belong . At the time of the crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not integrate as expected , but there was no doubt of the Archbishop 's position . For a majority of the white citizens of New Orleans to insist on segregation was to insist , not merely on illegal conduct ,  | but also on behavior condemned by their church . Backed by the mayor , the responsible citizens , the Department of Justice , and the federal courts , the school authorities prepared to make the transition from total segregation to token integration , the first city to do so in the Deep South . Moderates may have controlled New Orleans , but they did not control the state government . In Baton Rouge , Governor Jimmie H. Davis , of ballad-singing fame , who had defeated New Orleans Mayor Morrison in a run-off primary in January 1960 , had yet to make his move . Davis had opposed Louisiana 's most extreme segregationists in the first primary , but he had done so on a platform promise of keeping public schools open and segregated , even if he had to go to jail for doing so . Attorney General Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a descendant of General Stonewall Jackson , announced he was prepared " to stand like a stone wall " to defend segregation.8 State Superintendent of Education Shelby M. Jackson insisted that the Orleans Parish School Board had no legal obligation to obey Judge Wright . Legislative leaders from rural northern Louisiana segregation country demanded that the governor and other state officials act to prevent New Orleans from desegregating . Segregationists elsewhere had already used every known device to circumvent injunctions and none of them had been able to prevent a city from complying with a judicial decree . Judge Wright was ready to counter any move they might make and he had the support of two other federal judges . Chief Judge Rives of the court of appeals and Chief Judge Christenberry of the district court were standing by in the event a three-judge court might be needed to counter an attempt to enforce segregation laws . The intervention of state authorities might cause disorder , and perhaps frustrate desegregation momentarily , but it did not have the slightest chance of forcing reversal of Judge Wright 's 8 New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Statement by Governor , August 17 , 1960 ; Open Letter from Attorney General ; Louisiana v.

The hopelessness of the cause was apparent to all except the segregationists themselves . They were so opposed to integration , so convinced of the rightness of their crusade , and so isolated from the countercurrents that they fought on undeterred by the inevitability of defeat . The Second Battle of New Orleans , like the First , in 1815 , was fought after the War was over . Nonetheless , it was to be a hard-fought battle . The governor 's first move was easily countered . Just before schools opened , Davis invoked a recently enacted state law to take control of the schools of Orleans Parish . He directed the Superintendent of the Orleans Parish Schools , James F. Redmond , to ignore Judge Wright 's order and open schools without desegregating the first grade . Davis had in reserve another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later admitted that closing schools would not preserve segregation . Attorney General Gremillion secured from a Louisiana state judge an injunction which ordered the Orleans Parish board , despite Judge Wright 's injunction , to comply with the segregation laws . At the request of the NAACP , Judge Wright ordered Governor Davis and other state officials " to show cause " why they should not be enjoined from interfering with the Orleans Parish School Board . The NAACP 's request was seconded by thirtyone white parents who , although objecting to integration , objected even more to state interference with the opening and operation of their public schools . Late in August a three-judge court , Rives , Christenberry , and Wright , assembled to hear the arguments . Attorney General Gremillion and his assistants were present ; Governor Davis was not . Two deputy United States marshals reported they had delivered summonses to various employees of the governor , but the governor himself had eluded them . Gremillion contended that the governor had no obligation to appear ; Chief Judge Rives  | cut off the discussion of the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but that his personal presence was not needed . The court put aside for the moment Gremillion 's dismissal motions , and instructed Charles Richards , attorney for the thirtyone white parents , to proceed . To save time , Chief Judge Rives told Richards to place certain facts in the record by affidavit rather than call witnesses and Gremillion protested ? he had not received a copy of the affidavit and , since he was entitled to notice , he said , he asked for a five-day postponement . Judge Rives read quietly from the rules of federal procedure , which gave the court discretion to dispense with calling of witnesses , and then overruled Gremillion 's motion . " You may proceed , Mr. Richards , " Chief Judge Rives said . Gremillion would not be silenced ; he declared loudly , " I do n't consider this justice . I demand my constitutional rights . This court is running roughshod over us . " " You may reserve your objections and I hope you will do it in a manner respectful to this court , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gremillion sat down , muttering in an audible tone about " justice , " " the Constitution , " and " den of iniquity . " As Richards started to read Gremillion jumped to his feet , strode down the aisle and out of the door , shouting as he went : " This is a kangaroo court . " For a moment there was silence in the courtroom . Then Gremillion 's chief assistant got to his feet : " Since I can not proceed in the absence of my principal , I respectfully ask the court 's permission to withdraw . " Judge Rives assented . The attorney general 's aides picked up their papers and left . The commotion in the courtroom quieted down while Richards introduced his affidavit and made a brief speech for his clients . His clients , he said , were asking the court either to suspend or modify Judge Wright 's ruling . If the court would not do this , then his clients felt the court should prevent  | state officials from closing schools or from otherwise interfering with the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis kept a standing airline reservation so he could attend all judicial proceedings , was there to present the arguments : " This is no longer a case of Negro children seeking their constitutional right .

" Judge Rives asked , " Is there any other evidence to be intro-duced ? " There was no answer . " Let the record show , " Judge Rives said , " that the court has called for evidence from the defense in open court and none is offered . " Five days later the court handed down its ruling . Not only did the judges order Davis to return control of the schools to the school board , but they declared seven state laws unconstitutional , including laws purporting to authorize the governor to close schools . Further , the judges ordered Davis and other state officials not to take " any action which would deny school books , school lunches and school funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurists had checkmated every technique segregationists had employed in the six years since the Brown decision . What had taken two years for Little Rock moderates to litigate , was accomplished in New Orleans in ten days . There was nothing left to decide ? so it seemed . Judge Wright had told the Orleans Parish board to desegregate . He and his fellow jurists , in effect , had ordered state officials , as one might say in New Orleans , to keep their " cotton-picking hands " off the New Orleans schools . Among those restrained by this and subsequent federal injunctions were : the governor , the lieutenant governor , the attorney general , the state superintendent of education ,  | the state board of education , the Orleans Parish School Board , the state treasurer , the state adjutant general , the superintendent of the state police , the district attorneys of all judicial districts of Louisiana , all the sheriffs , all chiefs of police , all mayors , and eventually even the state legislature . And this was not all . Judges Rives , Christenberry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few weeks later Federal District Judge Edwin F. Hunter heard the evidence and told Gremillion he was entitled to fight hard but not " out of bounds . " He sentenced Gremillion to sixty days , but waived the sentence and put him on eighteen months ' probation . Gremillion sobbed with joy at his close escape from prison . Attorney General Gremillion announced that Louisiana had reached the end of its legal strategy . Governor Davis was silent . He had insisted that the federal injunction was not binding on him , yet he seemed unwilling to challenge it and to take advantage of the opportunity to live up to his campaign promise of going to jail . He continued to elude federal marshals . By the time the New Orleans crisis was over , Davis 's office was decorated with plastic-covered federal subpoenas , restraining orders , and injunctions . Federal marshals , denied admission to see the governor , had left their orders with state employees , who refused to touch but neatly covered them with clear plastic . By this time schools were to open . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Judge Wright in his chambers . They told him that they were prepared to desegregate , but because of the state 's interference they had not been able to make preparations . They asked the judge if he would postpone the effective date of his decree until November 14 , the beginning of the second quarter . Judge Wright , convinced the board members were acting in good faith , consulted with the attorneys for the negro plaintiffs , and over their objections granted the board 's request .  | Judge Wright and the school board had made a strategic error . Governor Davis had saved face by going through the motions of interfering with Orleans Parish . If Judge Wright had insisted on immediate desegregation , the deed would have been done before the segregationists reorganized . But at the time , another short postponement seemed unimportant . The segregationist attorney for the school board resigned in disgust , a more moderate lawyer was chosen , and Superintendent Redmond made quiet preparations . The delay in the execution of the New Orleans desegregation program had exposed Governor Davis to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then ten days before the second quarter , the governor called the Louisiana legislature into special session . One hundred and forty lawmakers converged on Baton Rouge ; their mission , to prevent New Orleans from complying with Judge Wright 's integration order ; their tactics , to " interpose " the legislature between the federal courts and the school board ; their hope , that Judge Wright would not dare to move against the entire legislature . The legislators adopted a package of twenty-nine segregation laws that purported to strip the Orleans Parish board of all authority over New Orleans schools and to transfer control to an eight-man legislative committee . State police were instructed to arrest any federal marshal or federal judge who tried to prevent the committee from operating segregated schools . Four days before desegregation was to begin , the legislative committee assembled in the school board 's offices and went through the formality of taking charge of New Orleans ' 121 schools . The committee rehired Superintendent Redmond and instructed him to open schools in compliance with the newly enacted segregation laws . Representative Risley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 're going to operate the schools the same on Monday as they are operating today , with the same students assigned to the same schools with the same  | teachers . There will be no change . . . . We know of no transfer of students nor requests for transfer which have been approved . " 13 To this moment the Department of Justice had refrained from actively entering the case . Minutes after the legislative committee adjourned , United States Attorney M. Hepburn Many filed the first of his many motions " to maintain and preserve the due administration of justice and integrity of the judicial process of the United States . " Many was retained in his position by Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy over the protest of Senator Allen J. Ellender of Louisiana . Senator Ellender acknowledged that he had voted to confirm Many in 1957 . He said , " He came highly recommended . I did n't know he was going to turn coattail. " 14 After Attorney General Kennedy took charge of the Department of Justice , the Attorney General himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many 's first move was to ask Judge Wright for an order restraining Louisiana police from interfering with the federal marshals assigned to carry out the court 's orders . At the same time Attorney Richards , speaking in behalf of the white parents , asked Judge Wright to prevent state officials from enforcing the recently enacted segregation laws . The NAACP did not file its motion for an injunction until several days later . Ordinarily , federal judges will not restrain the enforcement of state laws until there is time for a hearing before a three-judge court . But this was an emergency . Before a three-judge court could have held a hearing , November 14 would have passed and segregationists would be able , by passing new unconstitutional laws , to postpone desegregation once again . Judge Wright was just as bold in behalf of the Constitution as his opponents were in behalf of segregation . He issued immediate orders restraining the governor , the state superintendent of education , all state police , sheriffs , and local officials , the legislative  | committee , and , for good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . He told them to cease enforcing state segregation laws and to cease interfering with the Orleans Parish board until a three-judge court could be assembled to determine if these restraining orders should be rescinded or made permanent . That night the school board , all but Wagner , met . Their new attorney , Samuel I. Rosenberg , told them , " You have absolutely no alternative except to comply , " 16 and Board President Rittiner announced that five of the 137 Negro children who had applied for a transfer to schools nearest their homes would be allowed to attend two schools heretofore reserved for white children . Judge Wright 's order had left room for the board to apply pupil-placement procedures . Segregationists were unable to prevent token integration , but for the time being their intense opposition forestalled litigation on the question whether the board had properly applied pupil placement . Rittiner refused to make public the names of the children or of the schools to which they were assigned . The angry legislators returned to Baton Rouge next day for an emergency Sunday session . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Orleans delegation , the aroused lawmakers , in the name of the state 's rights , and squarely in the face of federal authority , once again seized control of the New Orleans schools . In six hours , three new segregation bills were introduced , adopted , and signed into law . Some of the legislators did not even have time to read the bills they voted for . As Senator French Jordan said at a later date with respect to other segregation legislation , " I do n't know what we are fixing to do , but we are fixing to do something and I 'm going to be for it . " 17 What the legislature was fixing to do , since Judge Wright had ordered its committee to leave the Orleans Parish schools alone , was to have the entire legislature serve as the school board for Orleans Parish . Legislative sergeants-at-arms were instructed " to  | repair to all public schools in the parish of Orleans where intruders have ordered the unlawful transfer of pupils from one school to another " and to arrest these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructions . For good measure , the legislature " fired " Superintendent Redmond and Attorney Rosenberg and declared Monday a state-wide holiday . By declaring Monday a school holiday the legislature sought both to prevent the Orleans Parish board from executing its desegregation program and to support State Superintendent Jackson . The day before , Jackson was served a copy of Judge Wright 's order not to interfere , and had declared Monday a holiday . For this he was subsequently cited for contempt . His trial was postponed until after the crisis . At 9:00 P.M. , twelve hours before desegregation was scheduled to take place under Judge Wright 's injunction , the legislators adjourned . Judge Wright had moved against the eight-man legislative committee . Would he move against the entire legislature ? It did not take long to find out . At 9:45 P.M. Sunday night , on motion of the Department of Justice and the Orleans Parish board , Judge Wright ordered " the Legislature of the State of Louisiana , and the individual members thereof , and their agents " to make no attempt to enforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other action interfering with or circumventing the orders of this court . " 18 The legislature had done its best ; Judge Wright had done more . For the first time a federal judge had addressed a restraining order to an entire state legislature . But then never before , at least not since the Civil War , had any legislature ever so defied a federal judge . On Monday morning four little girls ? the parents of the fifth decided at the last moment to keep their child in her segregated school ? under escort of United States marshals , transferred to their new schools ; three to McDonogh Number 19,19 and one to  | Frantz . Since segregationists did not know which schools were to be desegregated , they were only able to assemble a small jeering crowd of white mothers to greet the children . There was relatively little commotion . Desegregation had come to New Orleans and to the Deep South . There had been little trouble . Mayor Morrison , school authorities , Judge Wright , and the nation relaxed . The moment of action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . The worst would have been over if the Louisiana lawmakers had gone home . But they would not . Judge Wright had ordered them to " make no attempt " and not to take " any other action interfering with or circumventing " the orders of his court . The legislators proceeded as if such an order had never been issued . Since they refused to question their first premise ? segregation laws are constitutional ? to the legislators the federal judges who ordered desegregation were obviously usurpers whose orders were not entitled to respect . The legislators considered themselves courageous and dedicated defenders of home and hearth , champions of " the people " against " atheistic Communists " and their " dupes . " During the next several weeks the lawmakers adopted one plan after another , each openly designed to preserve segregation , each in clear conflict with the Constitution of the United States , each a violation of Judge Wright 's restraining order , each quickly set aside by the federal courts . The legislature made seven attempts to oust the four moderate school board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it again " fired " Superintendent Redmond and Attorney Rosenberg , substituting Gremillion as the attorney for the Orleans Parish schools , a move the federal jurists tagged as " one of the Legislature 's less sophisticated attempts to preserve racial discrimination in the public schools of New Orleans " ; it his fortune to establish schools and who freed his slaves early in the century .  | withheld funds from Orleans Parish ; it ordered banks to refuse to honor checks drawn by the school board ; it withheld the paychecks of the teachers and employees in the two desegregated schools . The Louisiana legislature enacted over forty laws , all set aside as unconstitutional by the federal jurists . In order to preclude a federal suit , the legislators tried to take advantage of the fact that ordinarily federal district judges will not take jurisdiction over a case once it has been initiated in a state court . Such a case could be carried to the federal courts only if it were appealed up through the Louisiana judicial hierarchy to the Supreme Court of the United States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and neither appealed , the decision of the Louisiana jurists would be final . To effect this , the legislature created a new school board of five members for Orleans Parish . The governor was to appoint the board members to serve until 1962 elections . Before he could act , George L. Singelmann , an official of the Citizens Council of Greater New Orleans and an associate of Leander H. Perez , the state 's leading segregationist , asked State Judge Fred S. LeBlanc to enjoin the governor from appointing the board members . Judge LeBlanc issued the order . An appeal was hurriedly arranged to carry the issue to the Louisiana Supreme Court , a court almost as much under the control of segregationists as the Louisiana legislature . The Louisiana Supreme Court sustained the law . The strategy did not work . The Department of Justice and the regularly elected school board challenged it before the federal courts , pointing out that the Louisiana suit was not a new proceeding ; it was merely the thirty-eighth round in the eight-yearold Bush Case which had long been within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established precedents federal courts have full authority to preserve their jurisdiction and to prevent state judges from undermining federal injunctions.  | Once again Judges Rives , Christenberry , and Wright refused to allow the evasion of the purpose of law behind a procedural maze . Chief Judge Rives , writing for the court , said that ordinarily the creation of a new school board would be insulated from federal judicial review . But " the present acts . . . are no different in kind , or in purpose , from the others already declared unconstitutional . . . . The plain object of the measures is to frustrate the Orleans Parish School Board in its effort to comply with this court 's orders .... For obeying the constitutional mandate and the orders of this Court , the board brought on itself the official wrath of Louisiana . Despite reiterated injunctions expressly prohibiting them from interfering . . . the members of the Legislature , already called into special , now apparently continuous session , took every conceivable step to subvert the announced intention of the local School Board and defy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law or resolution of the Legislature , every act of the Executive , which seeks to subvert the enjoyment of this right equality of opportunity for education through access to nonsegregated public schools is unconstitutional and null and void . " The Louisiana legislature based its stand squarely on the doctrine of " interposition , " on the view that the legislature had interposed its authority between the usurping federal courts and the " people " and by so doing had relieved any person from any obligation to obey the offending federal injunctions . In fact , the Louisiana lawmakers contended that all persons in the state had a positive obligation to refuse to obey Judge Wright 's integration decree or any of the other desegregation orders issued by the district court . Not since the days of John C. Calhoun and the Civil War have many taken seriously the doctrine of " interposition . " Southern segregationists had been talking about " interposition " since the 1954 Supreme Court decision , but federal judges con- sidered such resolutions as " escape valves through which the legislators blew off steam to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louisiana legislators ' insistence that interposition justified their conduct , Judges Rives , Christenberry , and Wright in a strongly worded opinion stated : " Interposition is not a constitutional doctrine . If taken seriously , it is illegal defiance of constitutional authority . " Quoting from Chief Justice John Marshall , the federal jurists said : " If the legislature of the several states may , at will , annul the judgments of the courts of the United States , and destroy the right acquired under these judgments , the Constitution itself becomes a solemn mockery and the Nation is deprived of its own tribunals . " The Supreme Court could not be expected to repudiate the district court and endorse " interposition , " a doctrine completely destructive of the federal union . Gremillion , nevertheless , appealed for a stay . At the request of Solictor General Rankin , a prompt , brief , but unequivocal opinion of the Court endorsed the ruling of the district judge . Interposition is " without substance , " it said , and never has been a legal doctrine . The complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejection of their schemes , did not daunt the Louisiana lawmakers . Representative Ford E. Stinson , a fervid segregationist , called the Court 's ruling " claptrap . " " We are only saved , " he said , " from the hands of these demagogues by the hand of the Lord when he takes them . " He called for " full steam ahead , let 's keep going . " And so the legislature went ahead in the face of the federal judges ' injunctions . They courted contempt citations joyfully . Some of the more extreme and politically ambitious wanted to go to jail . Judge Wright and his fellow jurists refused to be provoked . The Department of Justice did bring contempt charges  | against the presiding officers of the two chambers , and Superintendent Jackson , who had refused to sign paychecks for teachers and employees of the two desegregated schools . And in its first public civil rights move the Kennedy Administration expanded these charges . Despite deliberate disobedience of the orders of the court , however , the judges refrained from moving against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal judges allow the Louisiana legislators to go unpunished ? In part because of the questionable legality of such a move . Federal judges may prevent the enforcement of unconstitutional state laws and restrain those who try to enforce such laws , but whether judges have the authority to punish legislators for passing laws , however unconstitutional , is a question of a different order . Even if the authority to do so were unquestioned , politically it would have been undesirable . Moreover , it was unnecessary . Judge Wright and his brethren calmly set aside each segregation law the legislature adopted , and restrained the agents from trying to enforce these laws . United States Congressman Otto Passman came home from Washington to address the Louisiana legislature about the " outrageous " action of the federal judges . He indignantly told the lawmakers : " My friends , it is not pleasant to contemplate , but it appears to be true that at least some federal judges take their orders directly from the United States Supreme Court . . . . " No one could quarrel with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judges , the angry legislators gave vent to their feelings with strong accusations against the government of the United States . Judge Wright was their primary target , but Mayor Morrison and the Orleans Parish school officials were not far behind . The legislators condemned the New Orleans police ; the Methodist Church and " integrationists ministers " ; " un-American "  | professors at Louisiana State University ; and " the filthy , lying one-way newspaper that 's for integration , the Times-Picayune . " The legislators said they were depriving teachers assigned to the two desegregated schools of their salaries because , by refusing to leave their posts , they were " fighting this Legislature and knowingly implementing the integration of schools . " The Whitney National Bank ceased to be a state fiscal agent after it honored a check drawn by the Orleans Parish School Board . The Joint Legislative Committee on Un-American Activities investigated the professors at Louisiana State University , especially Professor Waldo F.
