" The students are restless , " says University of California President Clark Kerr and he would beyond a doubt include Mario Savio . Born in New York city , Savio glided through high school at the top of a class of 1,200 , spent two years in local colleges shopping for majors , then moved with his Sicilian-'immigrant parents to California and entered the university at Berkeley Soon was " disenchanted . " He " drifted " into the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee ( " Snick " ) and last summer joined a Freedom School in McComb , Miss. , to teach Negroes poetry history , math and genetics- " a good subject to show how black and white people are the same . " <P> Back at Cal in September , Savio found a cause to his taste when the university forbade on-campus collections for political ends , including Snick . He also found , in himself , an almost Latin American eloquence ( he used to stutter ) , a sense of demagoguery , and a neat flair for martyrdom . Savio dropped his classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battering down the university 's limits on out-of-classroom expression . His gifts were nicely matched by the university 's habit of vacillating between concessions and crackdowns . By early last week F.S.M. had won most of the freedom a student can use , including political activity and fund raising . The university authorities held out only for the right to add its own punishment to any that courts might take against students for off-campus political demonstrations . To this , angry F.S.M. leaders cried , " Double jeopardy ! " <P> Grandstand Play . At this stage of the dispute , President Kerr assembled the university in its huge open-air Greek Theater to announce that the administration would stand firm . Most students applauded , but to Savio , Kerr 's position was " totally inacceptable , " and the university was set up for a perfect grandstand play . <P> Suddenly Savio appeared from nowhere to grab the microphone . Before 13,000 astonished spectators , a campus policeman then grabbed Savio around the throat while another twisted his arm in a hammer lock . They dragged him away fighting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Minutes later , Savio was freed and when F.S.M. partisans yelled " We want Mario , " he naturally had to be allowed to make his speech . It was really no speech at all , just a masterfully brief and low-keyed announcement of an F.S.M. rally . <P> Unnerved , the administration passed the hot potato to the faculty . Next day the Academic Senate , composed of all professors and deans , proposed a capitulation to F.S.M. on the double-jeopardy issue , and a policy that " the content of on-campus speech or advocacy should not be restricted by the university . Off-campus student political activity shall not be subject to university regulation " " This is the best birthday present I ever had , " chortled Savio , who had just turned 22 and he acknowledged that if the cops had not dragged him away from the mike , " we would have been dead . "
