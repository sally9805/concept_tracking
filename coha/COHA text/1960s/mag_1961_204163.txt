No newlywed princess need watch her figure . She can be sure that everyone else is doing it for her . Ever since Princess Margaret married Commoner Antony Armstrong-Jones a year ago , London waist watchers have had a field day . But after two premature press guesses proved wrong last summer and fall , the susurrus of the rumor mills gradually died away . Last week the watchers were taken by surprise when Kensington Palace announced that Princess Margaret was " expecting " a baby in October or early November . <P> The Common Touch . As pints were raised in pubs and Welsh mums wiped away a happy tear , the man of the hour was Tony Armstrong-Jones , the onetime bohemian and free-lancing photographer , who until only recently has had his critics . Once the bloom was off the groom , Britain 's royalty-revering public made it plain that it was watching ex-Playboy Tony with a tolerant but suspicious eye , intent on making sure he did right by their Meg . Trouble was , there was little publicly that he could do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tony had no wealth of his own , so Parliament upped his wife 's allowance from $16,800 to $42,000 , and Tony had to move into one of his in-laws ' houses on the grounds of Kensington Palace . The butler promptly quit and told all , complaining that Tony was far too democratic for any royal servant to work for . To keep busy around the house while his wife was out working at her royal duties , Tony designed and built an elaborate balsa-wood model of an aviary for the London Zoo . Sniffed the bumptious Daily Express : " Mister Armstrong-Jones must now be ranked as one of the leading aviary designers in the country-a not overcrowded profession . " <P> Through it all , Tony kept a stiff , smiling upper lip . His popularity took a turn for the better when he took an unpaid , five-day-a-week job in a design center , despite his rather nebulous assignment : studying methods of consumer product testing . But the real breakthrough came when Buckingham Palace let Tony present the prizes in a schoolboy photographic contest in London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tony wrote his own speech , delivered it well . Afterward , reporters and cameramen whom he had known in his single days hesitantly gathered round . He broke royal family precedent to chat with them , and Britain saw Tony in a new , kinder light . Last week 's news that Margaret soon would produce an heir was the clincher . Cooed Daily Mail Columnist Eve Perrick : " Whatever the future of Armstrong-Jones as a public figure , of one thing he can be justly proud . As a husband , he is a definite hit . " <P> Fifth in Line . If the prospective father was beaming , the chroniclers of Britain 's blueblood lines were cracking their knuckles . The offspring will be fifth in line in succession to the British throne , after Queen Elizabeth 's three children and its mother . But since children take title from the father , the child will be born a commoner . The possibility that agitated royalists : Britain 's throne might some day be occupied by somebody called Mr. ( or Miss ) Jones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
