Man of the Year <P> Sir : <P> Unless memory fails me , TIME has never awarded its Man of the Year honor posthumously . Surely this year is the time to establish that precedent . Nobody anywhere on earth deserves this year the recognition more than the late Dag Hammarskjold . <P> <P> WILLIAM B. LIPPHARD <P> Yonkers , N.Y . <P> <P> Sir : <P> Your forthcoming selection has not been so easy in many a moon . I am confident that even the Russians are placing a safe bet it will be that great statesman and worker for peace in our time , Dag Hammarskjold . <P> L. W. VAN KEMPEN <P> Detroit <P> Sir : <P> This year , unfortunately , I feel that there is no doubt that a Russian must be named . Yuri Gagarin , the first man to circle the earth in outer space , must surely be named to hold this distinguished title . <P> I only wish it could have been an American who opened these many new horizons . <P> RICHARD LOWE <P> Canoga Park , Calif @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many footprints in the sands of time-many of them crisscrossing , all deeply etched . But I believe the perspective of time will underscore this year as the year of man 's first venture into space , as the start of a new era of voyaging into the unknown . <P> Therefore I nominate as Men of the Year Gagarin and Shepard , Grissom and Titov . <P> STAN COOPER <P> New Plymouth , New Zealand <P> Sir : <P> If the Man of the Year is chosen on a basis of " one who has done more to alter the world for either good or evil , " the man for ' 61 has got to be " Mr. K. " or a composite of all those who fled East Germany . These two nominees have done more to alter the picture of the world than anyone else . <P> PHYLLIS QUAYLE <P> Madison , Ohio <P> Sir : <P> Discounting the biological disqualification , I propose the most obvious , best-equipped choice for " Man of the Year " : the Mole . <P> RICHARD A. SWANSON <P> Pastor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Sir : <P> I know it 's a man 's world , but why does n't TIME give us a " Woman of the Year , " along with its " Man " ? Say on the back cover ? <P> EVELYN SPENCER <P> Toledo <P> Sir : <P> Have I the great honor of being the first to nominate Dr. Mary I. Bunting for an award by TIME of the title " Person of the Year " ? <P> SUE MOYER BOSSERMAN <P> Baldwin , Kans . <P> Promising Painter <P> Sir : <P> Thank you for the wonderful reproductions in your Nov. 24 issue , particularly for that glorious and luminous cover . I often wonder what some of today 's modern artists ( drip , slop and hoodwink schools ) feel when they look at masterpieces such as these . Awe ? Envy ? Shame ? <P> VICKI WOODWARD PATTERSON <P> West Newton , Mass . <P> Sir : <P> I look forward to seeing more of this artist 's work on future covers of TIME , and venture to predict that he will carve out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the art world . <P> MURRAY GEWIRTZ <P> Brooklyn <P> Sir :
