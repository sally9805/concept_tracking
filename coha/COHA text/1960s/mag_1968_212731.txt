Notes from a Sovient Prison CONTACT ON GORKY STREET by Greville Wynne. 222 pages . Afheneum. $4.95 . <P> <P> From 1960 until his arrest by the KGB in 1962 , Colonel Oleg Penkovsky of Soviet military intelligence funneled out to the West a steady stream of Moscow 's most vital secrets . His side of the story was recounted in The Penkovsky Papers , published in 1965 . Contact on Gorky Street is the autobiographical account of the British businessman , recruited by British intelligence , who befriended Penkovsky in Moscow and became his conduit to the West . The book is far more chilling than any of the fictional adventures of James Bond or Harry Palmer . <P> Wynne 's business , selling machines and goods to Communist countries , provided ideal cover and a frequent excuse to travel to Moscow . London 's MI-6 spent five years preparing Wynne for his spy role before he ever met Colonel Penkovsky . Part of the training was a routine initiation into the ar cane arts of a courier : how to conceal film , where to hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl in his hotel room . But one part consisted of a brutal simulation of what Wynne could expect in a Soviet prison if he was captured , and as it happened , he needed it all . <P> <P> The story of his ugly ordeal behind Soviet bars for 18 months is as harrowing as anything in Koestler 's Darkness at Noon , despite the fact that it was not Stalin 's grim regime but Khrushchev 's that punished Wynne . Though he was sometimes beaten , the primary torture was calculated degradation aimed at reducing Wynne to a broken , pliable animal . He never had adequate clothes or blankets for the harsh Rus sian winters . He was forced to live amid the stench of his own excrement . <P> He was made to stand naked before jeering female warders . <P> He was also systematically starved ( " The fish soup is bitter and floating with eyes . I swallow the soup , eyes and all " ) , but he was not allowed to die because his jailers persisted in the hope of extracting a confession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have learned to respect the Soviet Union . " Wynne never gave them that satisfaction , and was finally exchanged for a Soviet spy in British hands . A tale such as his resounds far louder than the hosannas of the Soviets ' 50th-anniversary celebrations .
