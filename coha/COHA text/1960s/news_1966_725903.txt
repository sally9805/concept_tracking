Strikes  --  let alone recession  --  have virtually shut it down . But the strikes are n't over the dismissal of " redundant " workers . They are over sharing the available work . Underlying this kind of strike is the conviction that before long things will be " back to normal . " Of those who have lost their jobs , more than half say they 'll go back to the industry " when business picks up . " In the interim many wives have found temporary work . Real estate is another indicator . Business is flat as a bowling lawn . But very few agents are offering cheap houses . Sellers are hanging on . They are confident they 'll get their price " later on . " This public confidence gives the Wilson government a firm base to build on for the future . What the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are working on VAT ? " value-added tax . " If adopted , it would be new to Britain . But it has already been tried with success in Europe . A manufactured item grows in value as it moves from , say , raw metal to finished product . Under ' VAT , each step in the production process pays a tax . One advantage is that export rebates  --  partial return of taxes to manufacturer  --  could be given more easily . And without violating international agreements not to grant export subsidies . The new system is also supposed to be an incentive to keep efficiency high and costs low at each stage of production . A disadvantage is that industry would be made to bear a very large part of the tax burden . And profits , already squeezed , would be further hit . However , most Britons regard their present tax system as inequitable , inefficient , and counterproductive . So VAT just might wind up as part of the next tax reform . Trends ... Central heating is catching on more and more in Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Electricity , officials are warning householders to insulate their homes .

With even better insulation , it reports , costs can be cut by 50 percent . A famous meridian slices through a park in Greenwich , England . It 's the basis ? of standard time throughout the world . But as Britain strengthens economic ties with Europe , Greenwich mean time ( GMT ) may vanish from the country of its origin .

If Britain changes to summer time around the calendar , office workers in London and Glasgow in winter would be at work before sunup . British farmers and their cows dislike summer time even in summer . But British businessmen and traders are looking to increased business with Europe in the years ahead . And they do n't mind getting up in the dark to go after it . How and why . . . British-American-German talks in Washington Nov. 9 have a tangle to unsnarl . The question is : Who pays for what military forces in Western Europe ? Both Britain and the United States are dunning Bonn for purchases to help them defray costs of their defenses in West Germany . Bonn has made promises in this direction . Now it is a question whether the present shaky Erhard government can fulfill them . Britain threatens to withdraw some of its troops unless costs are defrayed . But Americans now are transferring to England several Air Force wings which President de Gaulle is shoving out of France . The United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your troops from West Germany when new benefits will accrue to you from American military personnel on your soil ? That 's what the tangle is all about .
