txt Manuel Hernandez , a farmer who milks 30 cows near Campo FlOrida , fed a wagonload of sugar cane and green cornstalks into an electric silage grinder beside his new cement milking shed . " The Government built these improvements for me a few months ago . " the farmer said . " We have to increase milk ' production . Believe me , the people are fed up with shortages . " A Havana housewife waited in line at a state store for her 1family 's monthly ration of ' cooking oil . She carried two empty bottles , but when her , turn came the clerk said he could fill only one . Not enough oil had been delivered that month . " Do you think this will ever improve ? " the housewife asked wearily . The answer to this question weighs heavily on Cuba 's nineyear-old Communist regime . ' During a five-week tour of Cuba . this reporter found that Premier Fidel Castro is aware of the discontent among hit people and is instituting re- forms to put this Caribbean island of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Premier . active and in good health at 42. continually flies about his island giving advice on how to improve production . etost Western diplo-1 mats in Havana agree that a modest economic upturn can be expected within two or three years . However . the gap betweep official promises and economic performance remains a serious political problem . Despite the discontent. , largely in the cities . Mr. Castro towers as the unchallenged . dominating figure of the revolutionary regime . He rules with the support of a loyal , wellequipped army . and a small but militant party of young Communists . The bulk of the population still finds hope for betterment in Mr. Castro 's leadership . His death or incapacitation would be a devastating psychological blow . but there is a political structure that would carry on . The heir apparent is Maj. Rafil Castro , Minister of the Armed Forces and the Premier 's younger brother . Under him , the army would hold the real power . Castro Rules With Support Of Army and Party Today , Havana is preoccupied with the economic reconstruction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ine efficient , but it is evident thatI the regime has learned from past errors and is placing em-I phases on exploitation of Cuba 's ! natural economic resources . I The Government is pour- , ing millions of dollars into agrie cultural equipment . cattle breed-I ing , ' fertilizer . improved rural roads and irrigation . farm in- , stallations and the training ofl farm technicians . The Cubans are also utilizing , better management and technical skills while applying a more rational order of investment priorities in agriculture , construction , education and industry . " Those who thought this was a very radical , very revolutionary country incapable of organization are going to be surprised by Cuba 's agricultural ' development in 1970 , " mel Castro said recently . The United States ' economic blockade , designed to cripple the Castro regime ; has proved ! ineffectual .

' which consists of oil , wheat , machinery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuban leader ruffles the ! Russians with his cries for im-I mediate armed revolution in ! Latin America , but the Soviet Union has too much at stake in Cuba as a " Socialist showcase " to turn off its aid , which amounts to more than S150-million a year . The hero of Cuba 's propaganda is Ernesto Che Guevara , once a pillar of the Castro regime who was killed in Bolivia last October leading an unsuccessful guerrilla movement mounted by Havana . In rural schools . children put ' fresh flowers each day before pictures of Mr. Guevara , as at an altar . For Cuban officials , the most admirable people are the " liberation fighters " of Vietnam . Hanoi 's daily war communiqu ? s are read each morning to students in Havana high schools . " We feel closer to North Vietnam and North Korea than to any other countries in the socialist camp , " a Foreign Minister official said . " They are demonstrating that our position in support of armed revolution is correct . " Symbolically , a few individual air-raid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those in use in Hanoi . Castro Critical of Soviet Over Milder Line Mr. Castro . who was inclined four years ago to explore the possibilities for an improvement in relations with the United States . now seems convinced that Cuba 's security is best served by a worldwide confrontation between the " Socialist camp " and the United States to spread thin and wear down American military might . Mr. Castro is openly critical of the Soviet Union for taking what is seen here as a line of " political compromise " with the United States in Southeast Asia , the Middle East and Latin America . " More Vietnams " is Cuba 's official slogan . However . except for covert support that Cuba gives LatinAmerican guerrilla movements . the Cuban armed forces , equipped with Soviet MIG fighters , antiaircraft rockets and Russian tanks , are in a defensive posture . The " guerrilla spirit " therefore is expressed in required " voluntary " overtime work without pay by workers on projects behind schedule and by " guerrilla weekends " when thousands of office workers . women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on state farms . Every town and highway in Cuba is dominated by propaganda billboards with slogans and exhortations such as " On your feet ! The Eighth People 's Sugar Harvest Has Begun ! " This is the language of the Cuban Communist party . the only political voice on the isAn irrigation canal is deg land . Mr. Castro is the party 's ' First Secretary . which is a more important position for him toIday than the role of premier . Communist party membership is about S0.000 , only one per cent of Cuba 's population , ' but the party machine is installed substantially in all im- , portant sectors of the armed forces , administration and state economy . The party . as constituted ' since October , 1965 , is made ' up at the lower levels largely by so-called " vanguard work-I ers " who excelled in 1963 and 1964 in exceeding production ' norms , doing " voluntary " labor , and having a " good revolutionary attitude . " These cardcarriers are found in every factory . state farm and construction project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have received political , and technical instruction . perform supervisory and infor- , mation tasks on all activities in their provincial areas . from agricultural plans to selection of candidates for state scholar- , ships . Each Cuban province has a , pro-Tindal party secretary . but : even more important than these : are the provincial delegates of , the party 's political bureau , ' lover which Mr. Castro presides . These delegates are general- ; ly high military officers . as ! well as party stalwarts . They are the top trouble-shooters of the regime and are expected , to provide " revolutionary solutions " when problems de-I velop on major economic efforts . Labor Battalions Set Up For Special Projects One " revolutionary solution " i now in vogue is the organization of labor in military-style , brigades . These label- units . of up to 250 men . are under close party supervision and are used , for high-priority works . such as a fertilizer plant or a darn , that Mr. Castro wants come pleted in a hurry . The model for this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brigade , which Mr. Castro put to work across the wooded plains surrounding the Canto and Jobabo Rivers in Oriente Province . The brigade , using Soviet tanks to smash trees and 100 new French bulldozers . cleared 100,000 acres in 42 days . Mr Castro ordered this program to increase rice planting this year to meet a serious shortage . Since Communist China announced in 1966 that it could not supply Cuba 's rice needs , the ration was cut in half tie three pounds per person a , month . In Havana . rice is be-1 Iing sold on the black market at two pesos  --  officially the ' . equivalent of S2  --  a pound . The , minimum wage . on which most : Cubans live , is S5 pesos a , month . The main emphasis is on . raising sugar yields per acre . through fertilization and irrie gation , and mechanization of the harvest . Mr. Castro 's goal of producing 10 million tons of sugar , in 1970 is considered unattain- ' able by most observers here . but they feel that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be more , than Cuba has ever produced . ) Sugar accounts for 85 per cent of Cuba 's foreign earnings . At the same time , Mr. Castro is pushing ahead with the planting of citrus and coffee , the development of cattle for beef and dairy products , and increased acreage in foodstuffs , particularly rice . Gone are the plans to build a steel mill with a capacity of 1.3 million tons . and an automotive plant , which figured in the =fulfilled 196245 development program . Mr. Castro once promised Cuban housewives washing machines . Home appliance production has been put off now until the end of the ccming decade . What a visitor sees in construction now are power sta- ' dons , cement factories and fere tilizer plants at new indus-I trial locations . such as Nuee vitas and Cienfuegos . These will more than double Cuba 's ' prerevolutionary output . in the basic areas needed to support , an expanded agriculture . Cuba 's automobiles are ' falling to pieces and urban ' , housing is increasingly run- , down and overcrowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bulldozers . cranes and , heavy trucks work away at ' construction projects . And new vrarehouses and food pro'cessing plants are scattered through the countryside , along with new hospitals and schools . The regime calls on Cubans to accept sacrifices as if the country were at war . Cuban workers are exhorted consurely to seize their work tools as if they were guns and to ac in a " guerrilla spirit . " In addition . to tighter political control over production , an , important factor is the apparently high degree of political ' motivation among the thousand of young graduates of the technical schools set up - by Mr. Castro . Thousands of these are now : on state farms , in machine shops , teaching school , or active in programs such as the artificial insemination centers for cattle that have brought L3 million cows into a breeding , plan with Canadian Holstein bulk . 10.000 Students Enrolled In the Universities Hundreds of new engineers . veterinarians , physicians and economists are graduating from the expanded university system , which now has 40,000 students . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students at the technical schools . Most of these young men and women are members of the Union of Young Communists , the party 's youth movement . One of these is Rodrino Rodriguez , who is the administrator of the former United Fruit Company sugar mill at Presten . Oriente Province , now known as the Guatemala mill , Mr. Rodriguez was a kitchen helper in a restaurant when the Castro regime came to power . He worked his way up through the gastronomic workers ' union . went through a four-year course in administration at the Ministry of Industry , and now runs a mill producing 510-million a year in sugar products . His , salary is 250 pesos a month . " I am a peasant 's son who ! was given . a chance by the : revolution , " he said . Jose Antorao elartinea. 26 , years old . a Negro who is secand secretary Ef the Communist party in Bayamo , Oriente Province . is another of the thousands who have moved up . Mr. Martinez , a lanky farm- , boy from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his militiaman 's uniform at the big house where party members eat and ' sleep in Bayamo . A holstered revolver hung from his belt and ' he had a sheaf of gasoline re- ' Lion coupons in his blue shirt pocket for the jeep awaiting him at the door . ' There Are Lots of Plans , Party Official Says Military service and a course at the partv 's School for Revo- , lutionary Instruction prepared , Mr. Martinez for his party ca- , seer . Few young Negroes had such an opportunity in Cuban Political life before the revolu-tion . " There are lots of plans , " Mr .. Martinez said . " Fidel has many ideas and we see that they are carried out " Among the rank and Mee ! however , the political control of , production seems to produce ! only conformity without convic-I tion . The Cuban authorities con- , cede that except for the special labor brigades , productivity is : low . The former Nestle milk processing plant in Oriente , . for instance , now has a thousand : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prode ucts that 350 workers made bee fore the revolution . Others , who object to being ' under ideological pressure , are leaving Cuba . Among the 100 , - 000 people now signed up to go to the United States under an exodus arrangement there are many ordinary working-class families . A factory worker in Havana explained why he had decided to emigrate : " If they do n't get you into an organization , if you do n't join the militias , if you do n't dol voluntary labor , they do n't leave ' you in peace . It is n't enough just to do your job well . " On the other hand , Fernando Carlos Gutierrez returned to Cuba in 1961 from West Ncw York , N. J. , where he had a " good job and good friends " as a restaurant supplier . He now works in an iron foundry at San Pedro de Lajas , outside Havana . " I came back because I had faith in the revolution and in Fidel , " he said . " I keep telling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the discipline of American workers thines here would be the way Fidel says they should . " While the revolution has cut ! Cuba loose from traditional moorings and has torn asunder many families and personal lives , it has also opened great , opportunities for many thousands , particularly among the educated young . , They are involved in building a new Cuba . Some are militants disposed to make sacrifices ; others are opportui ; nistic . But in either case , the energies of Cuba 's youth are being guided into revolutionary channels . Time is not diluting the : Cuban revolution . Francisco Acosta Lora is a small farmer at Las Mercedes . ! Oriente Province . During the days when Mr. Castro was a guerrilla he smuggled supplies . through army lines to the rebels . Now Mr. Acosta is at odds with the local Communist authorities in Las Mercedes because they have not provided cement and lumber he was promised in 1960 to build a new farmhouse . " When Fidel hears about this someone will pay , " he said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
