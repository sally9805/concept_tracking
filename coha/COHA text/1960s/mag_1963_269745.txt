Since the start of the U.S. space programs , astronauts have been allowed to sell the personal stories of their flights into space to the high bidder of their choice . The first seven of them went under contract to LIFE , picking up $500,000 for exclusive details of their experience . Last fall President Kennedy endorsed continuation of the policy for the 16 men picked for the moon-bound Gemini and Apollo projects , and Field Enterprises Educational Corp . dropped in a whopping $3,200,000 offer . As part of the arrangement , LIFE agreed to buy exclusive magazine rights from Field . After six months of laborious work on contract details , an agreement was all but signed . But last week the Chicago publisher suddenly pulled out , and the deal was off . <P> Field 's problem was not with the astronauts themselves but with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , the Government agency that employs the spacemen and has final say on any of their commercial activities . In the dickering , NASA lawyers insisted that the Government approve astronauts ' stories before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract provision requiring NASA to avoid un reasonable delay . When NASA balked , Field called it quits . " At the rate we were going , it looked as if we were going to get a man on the moon before we got a contract , " said Field President Bailey Howard . <P> Space agency officials expressed surprise at Field 's walkout over what NASA considered a relatively minor point . In any case , other bidders were sure to renew their interest . One interested shopper : LIFE . <P> Throughout the final stages of Field negotiations , the rest of the press was debating whether such private profit arrangements for the astronauts added up to good public policy . The New York Times was emphatically against the whole idea because , according to the Times , it damages U.S. prestige abroad . " Unfortunately , we now present an image to many non-Americans that is none too attractive : the picture of a nation obsessed with money and materialism . " Just as firmly on the other side was the New York Daily News : " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dauntless men take their lives in their hands , and those of them which come back alive from outer space should be allowed to cash in legitimately on their adventures .
