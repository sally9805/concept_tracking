In a sharp about-face , retired Air Force General Nathan F. Twining , who had logged 44 years of active service when he resigned the chairmanship of the Joint Chiefs of Staff last September , took a post with one of the U.S. 's largest book publishing houses . He will be vice chairman of the board of directors of Holt , Rinehart &; Winston , Inc . But retiring Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson , who has had mountains of surplus corn on his mind through his eight hectic years in office , elected to linger in familiar pastures . Last week he became a director of Corn Products Co. , world 's largest processor of that troublesome crop . <P> After signing a property settlement ( terms undisclosed ) with Playwright Arthur Miller in Manhattan , Cinemorsel Marilyn Monroe flitted off to Ciudad Jurez for a south-of-the-border , quickie coup de grce to their improbable four-year marriage . Marilyn sounded little upset by her sudden move . " I would love to have a plate of tacos and enchiladas " she said . <P> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aging daughters of two famous men fought to keep things as Papa would have liked them . In Manhattan , Helen Clay Frick , 70 , for 41 years a trustee of the great art collection amassed by Steel Tycoon Henry Clay Frick , quit in protest when other trustees overrode her objections to accept three art objects left to the collection by the late John D. Rockefeller Jr . Insisting that her father never intended to have his collection supplemented by gifts from others , Miss Frick also snorted that the Rockefeller bequests-a Piero della Francesca painting and two marble busts-were either inferior art to start with or damaged . Down in Washington , Alice Roosevelt Longworth , 76 , was no less outraged when she heard of a scheme to designate part of a projected Washington cultural center as a memorial to rough-riding Theodore Roosevelt . Mrs. Longworth blasted the plan in tones that sounded like an echo of T.R. himself . Said she : " The hell with the cultural center as a memorial . I flee from thinking about things like that .

The holidays over , Elizabeth and Philip set off on a historic tour of Britain 's former Indian empire . First stopover was in Cyprus , where no British monarch has set foot since Richard the LionHearted ( in 1191 ) . Over an orange squash , the Queen chatted cordially with bush-bearded President Archbishop Makarios , so recently a mastermind of the Cypriot revolt against the Crown . Flying on to New Delhi , Elizabeth was greeted thunderously by some 1,000,000 Indians who caught their first glimpse of a British ruler since Elizabeth 's grandfather , George V , came to India in 1911 soon after his coronation . Somewhat unnecessarily , Prime Minister Nehru called on his nation to welcome Elizabeth warmly-but allowed that should she decide to go tiger hunting , " I am not going with her .
