txt Four national civil rights leaders appealed yesterday to Negroes to end the mob rule and violence that have spread through the urban ghettos . A joint statement issued by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. , A. Philip Randolph , Roy Wilkins and Whitney M. Young Jr . said the violence was selfdestructive for Negroes , who are the " primary victims of the riots . " The statement was agreed to in a series of telephone conversations among the leaders . According to a Washington source , the leaders drafted their appeal in response to an indirect request from President Johnson . While urging the end of the rioting , the four men demanded forceful suppression of the rioters . Called ' Criminal Acts ' " Killing , arson , looting are criminal acts and should be dealt with as such , " they said . " Equally guilty are those who incite , provoke and call specifically for such action . There is no justice which justifies the present destruction of the Negro community and its people . " We are confident that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to violence in the streets . " Asking " Who are the dead , the injured and the imprisoned ? " the leaders replied : " It is the Negroes who pay and pay and pay , whether or not they are individually involved in the rioting . And for what ? " Tell of Long Fight The four leaders said they had fought long and hard to achieve justice for all Americans and had consistently opposed violence . " Riots , " they said , " have proved ineffective , disruptive and highly damaging to the Negro population , to the civil rights cause and to the entire nation . " The : signatories of the statement called " upon Negro citizens throughout the nation to forgo the temptation to disregard the law . " This does not mean , they emphasized , that the Negroes should submit " tamely " to their present conditions . The four leaders also appealed to white Americans who , they said , " are not blameless . " The disabilities suffered by the Negroes , they asserted , continue in force because " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In their conclusion the four leaders criticized the 90th Congress , charging that it " has exhibited an incredible 1 indifference to the hardships of the ghetto dwellers . " They also reaffirmed their support of President Johnson 's appeal to black and white people to join in a determined program to maintain law and order . Dr. Xing , president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference , Mr. Randolph , president of the A. Philip Randolph Institute , Mr. Wilkins , executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , and Mr. Young , executive director of the National Urban League , and other organizations constitute the major civil rights establishment in the United States . This establishment is committed to the constitutional and legal process in achieving equal rights for the Negro people . Fear Effect of Riots The civil rights ' eiders apparently fear that , if unchecked , the riots could have a devastating effect on the established organizations committed to constitutional and legal procedures . Bayard Rustin , an acknowledged philosopher and strategist of the civil rights ' movement , organizer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. Philip Randolph Institute , painted the following picture ' of the future if the riots are not halted , and if white society does not come forward with broad constructive programs : " The rioting must be stopped . Whatever force is necessary should be used . If the riot 's continue , they will be a threat to all civil liberties . Unconstitutional laws of repression may be passed . There will be a fantastic backlash from white people who are weary and frightened , of the Negroes . " Backlash in Congress ' " There will also be a fantastic backlash in Congress , " he continued . " The situation today has a parallel in 1877 when the North withdrew the Union armies from the South . The withdrawal was followed by Southern repression of the Negroes . The riots today could lead to the same kind of repression . " If the rioting continues , an atmosphere will be created which the established civil rights leadership will be robbed of standing . The effect on the leadership could be devastating . The movement could be destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destructive elements in the ghettos . If the white and black people do n't cooperate in changing conditions , this is what may happen to Negro leadership . " Mr. Rustin suggested that Congress remain in session through August and enact special legislation including a huge public works program . Though profoundly disturbed and full of anxiety for the future , Mr. Wilkins did not quite agree with Mr. Rustin 's desperate prognosis . " It is unthinkable that a substantial part of the Negro community should choose the tactic of disorders , " he said . " The mass of the Negroes is not joining the snipers who are only a minuscule group . I refuse to get alarmed to a point bordering on panic . " Mr. Wilkins agreed that the civil rights movement was facing . the greatest crisis in its long history . " But the Negro community suffered setbacks in the past , " he said . " None of ' these setbacks resulted in the mass of the people turning away from the established organizations to join new and ad hoc groups . " Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Urban League , said the riots must be stopped and rioters punished and added that " those who incite riots , those who try to delude the black American Into believing that he can win a struggle with weapons , must be challenged . " Johnson Is Defended WASHINGTON , July 26 ( UPI ) ? The chief Congressional lobbyist for the N.A.A.C.P. defended President Johnson today against " intemperate and partisan " Republican charges of a lack of leadership that led to Negro rioting . Clarence Mitchell , director of the N.A.A.C.P. 's Washington bureau , told the House Education and Labor Committee that the Administration 's $2-billion bill to . extend the antipoverty drive should be expanded . " This Is no time to play politics with human misery , " he said . " It 's not the President 's fault . " Nothing will he gained , and a great deal of dangerous bitterness Will be generated , If those who may disagree with the President for political or economic reasons try to buttress their arguments with appeals to base emotions and to racial prejudice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
