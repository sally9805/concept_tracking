Notes and Comment W aHAT with the current enthusi- sm for Japanese art in this country , it was inevitable that some of those incomparable one-line poems that Japanese in all walks of life go in for should begin to make their appearance , and we are all for it . Far out front in the 1960 contest is the poem composed at leisure and hung unobtrusively in the window of the Jasmine Shop , at 63 East Fifty-sixth Street , whose proprietors are being forced to move their specialty shop to make way for the Lord knows what . With the perfection of an ancient and still lively culture , the poem says , " We Sadly Leave This Friendly Neighborhood . " When those proprietors have found a new location , we hope they 'll let us know what it is . Nautical Historians WE 'VE been looking into a home- less but fl ourishing organ ization ? the Steamship Historical Society of America , whose New York chapter met the other evening at the 11 Broadway offices of the American Merchant Marine Institute . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on Broad Street , with the chapter 's chairman , Sergeant Len H. Malley , of the First Army 's Finance and Accounting Office , on Governors Island , and a former chapter chairman , Mr. Frank 0 . Braynard , who is director of the Bureau of Information of the A.M.M. Institute , as well as high-seas editor of the Society 's quarterly , Steamboat Bill . They explained to us that the Society , which has over a thousand members , some two hundred and fifty of them in New York , was founded in 1925 by seven men , none of them in the shipping business , with the idea of preserving important data about and pictures of North American self-propelled vessels ( no diesels , though ) , getting together and talking about them , and occasionally taking a cruise on them . " Our chief emphasis is on coastwise and river boats , but we also include ocean liners , " Mr. Braynard said . " We 've issued some worthwhile publications , such as a list of all the American steamships and steamboats from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full dimensions and a condensed history of each . The federal government began to issue an annual list of steamships in 1868 , so it was n't necessary to go beyond that . Right now , we 've got a royal headache under way  --  a complete catalogue of Mississippi and Ohio River steamboat advertisements for the first seventy-five years of steamboating on the Mississippi , all collected by one of our members in New Orleans . This will supplement our ' Advertisements of Lower Mississippi River Steamboats , 1812-1920 . ' I myself have written two books on ships ? Lives of the Liners ' and ' Famous American Ships ' and I 'm working on a third , ' The Elegant Steamship : The Life of the S. S. Savannah . ' " Sergeant Malley observed that the Society 's national dues are four dollars and local chapter dues a dollar extra ; that , besides the New York chapter , there is a New England chapter in Boston , a Southern New England chapter in Providence , and a Philadelphia chapter in Philadelphia ; and that anyone can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , " he said . " / think I 'll raise the local dues to two dollars tonight . " " Our typical member is a person who is not in the shipping business but is passionately interested in steamboating as a hobby , " Mr. Braynard said . " We have a number of bus drivers , and quite a few people in jail . I think that prisoners especially like to get Steamboat Bill . I 'm one of the few members who are in shipping . I 've been a member for nineteen years . I was born in Glen Cove , and was always interested in ships . I have a house in Sea Cliff with a big nautical library , and over six hundred oil paintings and lithographs of ships in the attic . Most of them are as big as this table . " We looked at the table , which could have seated four comfortably .

And I have a name board with Jupi ' on it , plus a beautiful curlicue , which I found on the bay side of Fire Island , where I have a cottage . It must be part of the name ' Jupiter . ' The only Jupiter I 've been able to trace is a British warship that was lost off Orient Point in 1812 . " " Many men in the Army have an interest in ships , " Sergeant Malley said . " The Army Engineers , with whom I have served , deal with ships , and the Army used to run transports . " " We have some rather interesting members , " Mr. Braynard said . " There 's E. J.

Another New jersey member , Roger 1Villiams McAdam , an insurance man , has written four books on the great paddlers of the old Fall River Line ; Commonwealth , Giantess of the Sound ' is his latest .

" He gave us a copy of Steamboat Bill , and we walked to the Institute , where some sixty people , including a dozen women and several teen-age boys , were assembled . Sergeant Malley assumed the chair and raised the local dues to two dollars ; the Society 's president , Mr. James T. Wilson a Consoli-dated Edison engineer , of Staten Island , we were told  --  announced that the- annual national meeting would be held in two weeks at the New-York Historical Society , and would he followed by an inspection of the U.S.N.S. General Patch and a dinner at the Seamen 's Church Institute ; and a lively color movie of the oceangoing tugs of the L. Strait Towing Company , of Rotterdam , was run off .

Now , an artist who works in paper clips and cellophane tape as well as in oils is certainly worth a visit from us , and off we went to the offices of Ruder &; Finn , no East Fifty-ninth Street , for a talk with Mr. Finn . Founding partner in the firm and clip manipulator extraordinary , Finn is a cheery young man of thirty-eight with a shock of black hair , lively brown eyes , pointed ears , .1nd an air of satisfaction with his lot All around his sunny office were figures like those at the gallery . " Are n't they nice ? " Finn asked us , welcoming us with one hand and waving toward his creations with the other . " I 'm really a painter , you know . I love laying paint on good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer accident . Three or four years ago , I gave up smoking , and you can imagine how nervous that made me . At a business meeting here , I started twisting paper clips  --  what they call the giant size , about an inch and a half long , which gives you plenty of wire to work with . I found that by straightening the clips and then linking them about each other I could form quite pleasant-looking armatures . At the time , we had a client who manufactured cellophane tape , and it occurred to me one day to wrap my little armatures in half-inch tape . Charming ! At first I thought of them as mere doodles , intended to keep my restless fingers occupied , but before long I became fascinated by their possibilities as sculptured forms . In spite of myself , I had to take them seriously . " Once Finn 's doodles had promoted themselves from therapy to art , he was tempted to abandon paper clips in favor of more conventional materials , but ordinary wire lacked , for him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could find no material as jewellike as fresh cellophane . " The only drawback was that after a year or so the wrapped tape would lose its translucency and turn a dirty yellow , " he said . " I tried to prevent this with fingernail polish and plastic spray ; I even took one of my figures to the Rolls-Royce people and had them give it the finishing treatment that they give a Rolls body . No luck . But just recently I found a solution to the problem . I made a marvellous little nude of paper clips and filled her with a mixture consisting of strips of Polaroid filter and clear plastic from an old ice tray that I 'd smashed to smithereens . The results are even more beautiful than what I can get from tape , so it looks as if I 'm in paper-clip sculpture to stay .

Nobody in the textile industry gave a hoot  --  we have n't had a textile client interested in contemporary art to this day  --  but a lawyer friend of ours happened to see the presentation and asked us if we could do a similar one for the record industry . We said we could , and we did . It turned out that he was Perry Como 's lawyer . We had n't the slightest idea who Como was , but we soon discovered that he had a little something to do with making records . The next thing we knew , we were in public relations , with Como as our first client . But we 're both still artists . We even earn money at it .

OVERHEARD in a West Side steak house , one waiter to another : " Do n't be too polite , or they 'll think we 're unsuccessful . " Hot Spot NLONG those who have been bumped out of the Lincoln Square area to make room for Higher Things is the Atomic Energy Commission , which has had to shift its New York headquarters to a couple of floors of an old loft building down on Hudson Street . The Commission recently held a lively loft-warming there for the press , which we attended . Our host , Mr. Joseph C. Clarke , local manager of the A.E.C. , said that the chief purpose of the warming was to acquaint everybody with the Commis- sion 's expanded Health and Safety Laboratory , which , among other duties , has charge of collecting and analyzing fallout samples from all over the world . Dr. John H. Har- ley , assistant director of the laboratory , told us that , taking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty satisfactory one these days . " We expect the fallout problem to level off in the immediate future , " he said . " Although the amount of man-induced radioactivity will continue to increase , as a result of new industrial applications of atomic energy , the total amount of fallout will continue to decrease provided , of course , that the moratorium on nuclear testing continues and that no unexpected explosions occur . France 's nuclear explosion , by the way , has caused no noticeable increase in fallout . " Dr. Harley went on to say that we could expect to " enjoy " ( his word ) our usual seasonal increase in air concentrations of fallout this spring , to be followed by a corresponding decrease later in the year . " We hear a lot about the radioactive contamination of food , such as milk and asparagus , by strontium 90 , " he said , " but one should bear in mind that the quantities actually present in air , food , and soil are so infinitesimal as to be meaningless in toxic terms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the big projects we 're working on now is to determine the amount of natural radiation that already exists in different parts of the world , so we 'll be able to detect a significant man-made increase when it occurs . Every day we test some six hundred samples of atmosphere and fifty samples of food , water , and soil in our laboratory . We try to make this sampling truly representative , and our regular inventor- ) includes baby foods from a Brooklyn supermarket as well as African cheese . " What precautions , we wanted to know , is the A.E.C. taking to protect the public from an accidental overexposure to radiation ? " We 're doing everything in our power to prepare for the time when the atomic age hits us with full force , " Dr. Harley said , quite cheerfully . " Already the accident potential is increasing enormously . Here at headquarters , we now have what we call a hot-spot team , which operates on a round-the-clock basis . It 's the hot-spot team 's job to cover any sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major catastrophe  --  a shipping accident , say , or a spill by a user of isotopes in some steel plant . The hot-spot team has at its disposal a radio car with a flashing light and a siren , and we 've arranged with the Coast Guard to have a helicopter instantly available , and with the Mitchel Air Force Base , on Long Island , to have a transport plane available . So far , none of the calls the hot-spot team has gone out on have proved serious . Most of them are cases of mistaken identity , like when somebody calls up to complain that a neighbor or fellow-worker is radioactive and the poor man turns out to he full of static electricity . " We left Dr. Harley in order to take part in a speedy tour of the laboratory 's facilities ; various members of the staff , including physicists , chemists , instrumentation specialists , radiochemical analysts , and industrial hygienists , gave us brisk little talks on their particular subjects , and nearly everything they said went past both ears . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used . Latin is a dead language , and we 'd supposed it was constantly growing deader , but , oddly enough , it appears to be the language of the coming thermonuclear age ; we were battered by such terms as " depositional differentiation " and " inadvertent criticality " ( we think this refers to the state of nuclear crisis we 're all so anxious to avoid ) , and were shown such mechanisms as anti-coincidence counters , vacuum evaporators , ionization chambers , dosimeters , particle separators , and methane proportional neutron counters . Of all the gadgets we saw , the most impressive , and one of the easiest to pronounce , was a thirty-ton human spectrometer , or whole-body counter , which is capable of measuring the quantity and quality of radiation given off by human beings . It resembles a vast safe and is a chilling object to think of being immured in , even temporarily . An instrumentation specialist pressed a button , arid the great door of the spectrometer swung open , revealing , on a sort of deck chair , a complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This ghastly knight in plastic armor serves as a test subject , in lieu of living people , we were told , and as we stared at him we heard issuing from the vault the recorded voice of Julie Andrews singing " 1 Could Have Danced All Night .

Inehan Ambassador MR . MOHAMMED ALI CtrRnrM CHAGLA , the Indian Ambassador to the United States , gave a talk at the Yale Club last month , and we subsequently approached him in the lounge for an autobiographical chat , but so surrounded was he by well-wishers , and so soon due back in the nation 's capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , for the moment , no soap . " Come to Washington and have lunch , " he said generously , and this we presently did . We took a cab from Union Station to the Embassy  --  way the hell and gone out Connecticut Avenue , turn right on Macomb Street  --  where Mr. Chagla , a handsome man with curly white hair and a charming smile , greeted us in a vast drawing room full of chandeliers , French furniture , and Indian paintings . " I 've just been to Cuba , " he said , joining us in a Martini . " I 'm accredited there as Minister , and to Mexico as Ambassador . This house used to belong to one of the Guggenheims , and later a French count had it . The paintings belong to rne . I 'm very fond of the Impressionists , and I also enjoy abstract art . Most Indian artists are now becoming abstractionists . " Upon soliciting the story of Mr. Chagla 's life , we learned that he was horn in 1900 in Bombay and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he was president of the Oxford Asiatic Society and the Oxford Indian Majlis . " Majlis ' is a Persian word for discussion group , " he said . " Most of the hundred and fifty Indian students at Oxford be-longed to it . The Asiatic Society , which was smaller , consisted of undergraduates inter-ested in Asian politics . I succeeded Anthony Eden as its president . My three years at Ox-ford were among the happiest of my life . I spent part of them in the Inner Temple , in London , eating din-ners ; that 's the phrase for studying law , you know , because you dine with your teachers . I always wanted to go in-to politics , and I thought the law would help . " Mr. Chagla guided us into the dining room , where we plunged into an excellent souffle and a discussion of his legal career . This began in Bombay in 1922 . " The legal profession is a thrilling one , " he said . " Everything is grist to your mill ; you are your own master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can pick and choose . We have a very strong bar in Bombay . " In 1941 , he became a Puisne ( or Associate ) Judge of the Bombay High Court , and in 1947 ? the year his country achieved independence  --  its Chief Justice ; he was the first Indian to hold the post . " I could never have dreamt of being Chief Justice when I was a boy , " he said . " The High Court is the S upreme Court of Bombay ; it gets appeals and writs . " He became Ambassador in 1958 . He has also served as interim Governor of Bombay ; as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Bombay ; as Professor of Constitutional Law at the Government Law College , in Bombay ; as a judge of the International Court , in The Hague ; and as a delegate to the United Nations . " I came here alone that time  --  it was in 194b  --  but now my wife is with me , " he said during the roast . " We have two sons  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Calcutta , and Iqbal , who 's at King 's College , Cambridge  --  and a daughter , Husnara , who is married to an airplane pilot in Bombay . She 's given us a granddaughter , Niloofar , who is five . " During the ice-cream cake , we asked our host what life is like in his home town . " Terrible traffic , " he said . " Terrible parking problems . As Chief Justice , I had a very fine house . We had dances at the Willingdon Club twice a week , and I used to play golf there with three other judges Saturday mornings . The court was adjourned then , but most businesses were open , so we had the course to ourselves and could play as badly as we liked . I play quite badly . I look upon golf as an excuse for walking . I do n't dance very well , either ; I look upon dancing as an excuse for walking . The game I 'm really keen on is bridge , but I have no time for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cure , but it 's much more exacting than being Chief Justice . " We both withdrew to the drawing room for coffee and cigars , and Niloofar 's grandfather , after observing , " At one time f was a devotee of Lady Nicotine in all her manifestations , but now I smoke chiefly cigars , " advised us that his Yale Club stint was only one of many . " I 've travelled all over the country , talking at clubs and universities and before chambers of commerce , " he said , " There 's a great curiosity about India here , and I must say that American audiences appreciate frankness . I 'm most interested in telling people about India . My country has the manpower , but we need capital and machinery and technical know-how .

We have plenty of private enterprise  --  about ninety- per cent . Our steel mills are run by the government because private industry does n't have the capital .

Once our economy has become self-generating , we 'll he economically independent Just now we are taxiing on the airstrip ; in six or seven years we will have taken off .

" He is a simple , good man , with a genuine desire for peace . The people in India responded to his simplicity . His visit was definitely on the plus side . Since your foreign policy is bipartisan , the impact of it will last ; it wo n't disappear with the President . "
