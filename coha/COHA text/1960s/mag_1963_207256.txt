Originally the Common Market pledged itself to prevent the rise of the great industrial cartels that were the bane of prewar Europe . But now a different philosophy guides the Eurocrats . It is that the whole world is the coming market , and that for Europeans to win a larger share of it they must build companies as big as the American giants . Last week the Common Market approved in principle a major reconcentration of the Ruhr 's legendary but war-splintered Thyssen steel empire . The six-nation High Authority said that a " favorable decision " can be expected within a month on the petition of the August Thyssen Corp . to buy out the nearby Phoenix-Rheinrohr Corp. , which was a part of the Thyssen empire before the Allied occupiers broke it up . The result : a 7,000,000-ton , $1 billion-a-year combine that will vie with Italy 's Finsider as Europe 's largest steelmaker . <P> Probably Inevitable . By mating , the two German companies can offer a complementary product line : Thyssen ( pronounced Tiss-en ) makes mostly sheets and beams ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Merger was probably inevitable anyway : despite the postwar decartelization attempts of the Western Allies , the majority ownership of both companies still rests with the descendants of August Thyssen , who was Germany 's Andrew Carnegie . <P> <P> A century ago , miserly August Thyssen gained hold of high-grade ore supplies in Sweden and France and built ore-skimpy Germany into a major steel power . His son , Fritz Thyssen , was the first industrialist to support Hitler , but in 1939 denounced him and spent most of the war in a Nazi internment camp ; he died in 1951 . Fritz Thyssen 's widow , Amelie , now 85 , proved resourceful : she found loopholes in the Allied decartelization decrees and gradually welded together much of the old steel dynasty . From her Bavarian castle , Frau Thyssen today controls 52% of Phoenix stock and 12% of August Thyssen stock ; her daughter , Countess Anita de Zichy-Thyssen of Buenos Aires , holds another 39% of Thyssen stock . The countess thus would presumably inherit a majority share of both . <P> Increasing Support . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a petition to unite these Thyssen family assets . For this , the High Authority was rebuked by the harder-headed Common Market parliament , which argued that the Thyssen-Phoenix combine would produce scarcely one-third as much as U.S. Steel Corp . With world competition sharpening and the Common Market steadily building into one big economy , cartel-inclined Europeans are finding increasing support for their ambitions for bigness . Even in France , which helped break up the German cartels , the business paper Les Echos wrote : " For German heavy industry , cartelization and reconcentration are a condition of survival .
