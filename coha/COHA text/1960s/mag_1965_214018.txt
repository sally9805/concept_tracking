When it comes to subsidies , cotton is king . The Federal Government has long subsidized cotton growers . Then , when exporters complained that the farmers ' subsidy priced American cotton out of overseas markets , the U.S. started subsidizing exporters . And last year , after textile mill owners protested that the exporters ' subsidy permitted foreign mills to buy U.S. cotton cheaper than American mills could , the Johnson Administration pushed through Congress a subsidy for the mills . <P> The argument was that with the Government shelling out 6 of the 30 per Ib. paid by the mills , textile prices would fall and the consumer would benefit . This entirely ignored the fact that the consumer is also a taxpayer-and anyway , it has n't worked out . So far , the textile industry has received a mouth-watering $329 million in subsidies ; payments have even gone to prisons whose convicts work at weaving . Textile industry profits have soared to their highest level since Korea . But there has been no dramatic drop in wholesale or retail textile prices . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heavy cotton union suit has risen from $3.07 a year earlier to $3.14 , a long-sleeved sport shirt from $3.38 to $3.41 . <P> The overall cotton program was advertised as costing $448 million during its first year . Instead , it is now expected to amount to nearly $800 million . Reason : despite all the subsidies , exports have kept falling and production has kept rising , meaning that the Government has had to buy up still more cotton for its already bulging inventories . By last week the Commodity Credit Corp . owned a record 7,372,000 bales at a cost of $1.2 billion , on which storage charges alone run another annual $30 million . <P> In his 1965 farm message , President Johnson promised " to reduce the cost of this program and the level of cotton stocks . " But nobody expects the Administration to propose more than minor alterations in the current program-and cotton is likely to remain the only U.S. crop that is subsidized from stem to steam whistle .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
