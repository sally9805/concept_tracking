AMERICA 'S CONCENTRATION CAMPS by Allan R. Bosworth. 283 pages . Norton . $5.95 . <P> <P> In February 1942 , two months after Pearl Harbor , U.S. troops began herding 110,000 West Coast Japanese Americans out of their homes and into internment camps scattered throughout the Western states . The wholesale roundup , ordered by Franklin D. Roosevelt , made a kind of simplistic military sense . After all , the Pacific Coast had been formally-if somewhat hysterically-declared a combat zone . The presence of aliens , all of whom were at least potentially sympathetic to the enemy , seemed to constitute a visible threat to the U.S. <P> The danger , it turned out , was nonexistent . In this strident attack on the wartime sequestration , Allan R. Bosworth , 65 , a retired U.S. Navy captain , points out that no Japanese American was ever accused of sabotage or treason in the continental U.S. Indeed , a large number of the internees volunteered for duty with a regiment composed solely of Nisei , and they set an enviable combat record in Italy . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> There are even more embarrassing footnotes . After Pfc . Sadao Munemori was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor , the citation of her son 's heroism reached Mrs. Munemori behind the barbed wire of a relocation center at Manzanar , Calif . The American Legion canceled the charters of all Japanese American posts . In California in 1942 , State Attorney General Earl Warren , campaigning for Governor , urged voters to keep Japanese out of California " so long as the flag of Nippon is flying over the Philippines . " <P> By 1944 , when it became clear that the U.S. was about to win the war , the detention of the Japanese finally proved too embarrassing for everyone . Although the Supreme Court had upheld the constitutionality of the presidential evacuation order , the relocation centers began emptying as suddenly as they had filled . The loss to the internees , who had been allowed to take with them only what they could carry , was estimated at $400 million , a figure that includes the farms , businesses and personal possessions they were forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was settled at approximately 10 on the dollar . In retrospect , the story of the relocation camps adds up to one of the sorriest chapters in U.S. history , one that is only somewhat ameliorated by the fact that the internees were treated decently in the centers . It is a story that bears retelling , but Bosworth is the wrong man to do it . His angry account lacks not only literary grace but balance . As he fulminates against this lapse of democracy , the author descends to the irrationality that caused it .
