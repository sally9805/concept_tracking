Michle Is Missing <P> The Green Berets named a search-and-clear mission after her . Landing lights and television cameras were trained on her when she visited an aircraft carrier , and the sailors were later treated to an " Hour with Michele " over closed-circuit sets . After she spent a night in the field with the 4th Infantry Division near Pleiku , the soldiers nailed a sign to a tree : " Michele Slept Here . " But last week Michele Ray , the red- haired , 29-year-old French beauty and ex-model , was nowhere to be found : she had been captured by the Viet Cong . <P> Considering the daredevil way she operated , it came as no surprise . She once drove a Renault all the way from Argentina to Alaska , and the same idea occurred to her while covering the war as a freelancer in Viet Nam . Why not drive from Ca Mau , at the nation 's southern tip , to the Demilitarized Zone in the north along 600 miles of ragged road and Viet Cong ? In December she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land mines . <P> During the first 400 miles of her trip , Michle encountered the Viet Cong only once-on Christmas Day . Cheerfully pointing to herself , she kept repeating " Phap , " the Vietnamese word for French . The startled Viet Cong gave her a cup of tea and sent her on her way . The incident may have left her a mite overconfident . When military officers at De Due warned her not to proceed any farther along Highway 1 because North Vietnamese regiments were thought to be in the vicinity , she blithely disregarded them . <P> Plunging ahead , she was forced to stop two miles north of De Due when she reached a five-foot-wide ditch that had been hacked out of the highway by the Viet Cong . As soon as she climbed out of the car to take pictures , three Viet Cong took her captive . According to peasants who witnessed the proceedings , the V.C.s forced her to drive off the highway to the edge of a sugar-cane field . There they all got out ; while Michele munched a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut for her , the Viet Cong set up a booby trap in the Renault with a grenade and a 155-mm. howitzer shell . Then they marched their prisoner off . <P> In the next few days , U.S. troops operating in the area failed to locate Michele . Last week a captured Viet Cong reported that she was unharmed and being taken to the Viet Cong mountain headquarters . <P> NEWSPAPERS <P> Not Just Words-But Action
