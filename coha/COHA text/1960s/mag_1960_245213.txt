AIMEZ-VOUS BRAHMS . . ( 127 pp. ) - Franoise Sagan-Dutton ( $2.95 ) . <P> <P> To some readers . Franoise Sagan 's novels are of interest chiefly for the light they seem to reflect on their author . In Bonjour Tristesse , the light revealed a child passionately and exuberantly weary of the world , but now it shows an adult who seems tired of writing books . There is little in Author Sagan 's latest ( and fourth ) novel worth a compliment or a damn , although readers with an ironic turn of mind may cherish the 23-year-old author 's reference to " that incomparable love that comes with age . " The story , hardly more than the unhatched egg of a novel , concerns Paule-the only character whom the author has troubled to make credible-a pretty divorcee who , in her black moods , has begun to ask a hard question of her mirror : If spirits sag . can flesh be far behind ? Standing on the brink of 40 , she has avoided tristesse more successfully than most Sagan characters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become much too considerate . After an evening of bistro crawling , he drops her off at her flat , saying , " I 'll let you sleep . See you tomorrow , darling . ' ' Lately , Paule reflects , he has let her sleep more and more often . <P> What Paule wants is to marry Roger , a pipe-smoking , frail-chasing , hairy-handed brute a few years her senior , who lacks only a trout to look like a Field &; Stream ad . What she gets is a febrile few months with Simon , a delicate , beautiful and overmothered young man of 25 . Neither fellow is of a sort likely to be encountered except in the lavender dells of a schoolgirl 's fancy . <P> Such postcocity may not be very surprising , but it does little to support the author 's reputation as Colette 's successor in the heart-has-its-reasons trade .
