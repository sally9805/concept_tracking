txt Mayor Daley , in a solemn 10-minute television address last night , appealed to all citizens of the city to stop contesting civil rights matters on the street level . In an apparently unprecedented action prompted by his grave concern over the racial turbulence of the last few months , the mayor urged citizens to work together in an effort to end discrimination in all areas . The mayor spoke from 10 p. m. to 10:10 p. m. over WBKB , WFLD-TV , and WGN-TV . Given Time to Explain The mayor had asked for and been granted television time to explain the injunctive action which the city had instituted earlier yesterday and which had been granted by Circuit Judge Cornelius J. Harrington . The temporary injunction , said the mayor , will not end , but rather will regulate the civil rights marches . He said that the marches were legal and as such protected by the Constitution . " But as mayor of Chicago , I feel it is my responsibility to report to you directly because of the great moral and legal questions involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Notted The mayor pointed out that in the last two years there have been many civil rights demonstrations conducted in an orderly manner along various routes in the city . " There is no desire on anyone 's part to interfere with these orderly civil rights demonstrations , ' he said . " The only purpose of this suit is to end that kind of street demonstrations which have adversely affected the rights of all people by making it impossible for the police department to adequately protect the lives and property of every citizen . " He said that the police department has never interfered with the march , has sought to protect rights of all citizens and consistently has been praised for its work . Cites Difficult Point The failure of civil rights leaders to inform the police of the location , character , and extent of demonstrations has made this job more difficult , he said . " In the past two years , " Daley said , " there have been more than 20d civil rights demonstrations , and only in two instances have police been given in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property . " He said that under normal circumstances , the police have approximately 1,000 men on patrol sin neighborhoods . This is not possible with the marches , he continued . Points to Crime Rise " I have appealed to the civil rights leaders to take the issue out of the streets and onto the conference table , " the mayor said , adding that he pointed out to them that the taxing of police forces caused the crime rate to increase 25 to 30 per cent in the past 30 days . The mayor said that he reminded the civil rights leaders that much of the violence ? most disturbances  --  were being stimulated by extremists of the right and left , and by persons living outside the city , county , and state . Daley said be told them that citizens who want to see hatred subside and discrimination eliminated do not want to see the great issue of civil rights reduced to the level of street fighting and the collapse of law and order .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
