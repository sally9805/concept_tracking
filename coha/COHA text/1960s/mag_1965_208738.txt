New York Post Publisher Dorothy Schiff was tearfully threatening to shut down her paper unless she could save money by using a computerized typesetter . Bertram Powers , local boss of the International Typographical Union , was adamantly demanding 50% of any wage savings . Between the two , they were generating rumors that Manhattan might soon lose another daily . Then , after a week 's trial run with the computer at the Post , Bert Powers went off on vacation . The paper went back to its old-fashioned Linotype machines , and Mrs. Schiff , apparently accepting at least a temporary defeat , announced the negotiations had been adjourned sine die . <P> Had the problem simply been kicked around until it disappeared ? Hardly . New York 's newspaper publishers insist that they must automate to survive . Of the town 's six dailies , only the Times and the News are making money . Meanwhile , automation is either in operation or in the planning stage at newspapers across the U.S. Some 60 papers are already using the computer system that Mrs. Schiff wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine is bound to invade New York in force . <P> Rebellious Reporters . From California to Florida , composing rooms are humming and clicking to the tune of modern electronics . No longer must a printer justify lines by hand - expanding or contracting them to fit the width of a column . Nor need he worry about hyphenating words . Instead , a typist punches out a tape that is then fed into a computer . Out comes another tape , this one justified and hyphenated , ready to be fed into an automatic high-speed typesetter . <P> While Mrs. Schiff and her fellow publishers bargain for the chance to introduce this kind of computer , the Los Angeles Times , for one , has already moved a step beyond . For a brief period it experimented with machines that allowed reporters to punch out their own tapes as they wrote their stories . The machines rebelled against the reporters ' hunt-and-peck typing , and the reporters rebelled against the machines . Now a bank of typists makes tapes from reporters ' copy . <P> Automation experts agree that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have electronic readers to convert reporters ' copy into tape , while the computers will be able to digest editors ' corrections as well . Computers , which are now used for subscription and billing , will also set blocks of advertising copy . Ultraspeed phototypesetting machines will be able to run 1,000 lines of type a minute . <P> Unresolved Issue . The major obstacles to the onrush of automation are almost all human . On the one hand , newspaper management has been slow to grasp the importance of the new technology ; on the other , the labor unions fear that automation will cost them their jobs .
