Every once in a while , television interviewers have journalistic sense enough to put a good subject in front of a camera and just get out of the way . It worked so successfully last September with Eric Hoffer : The Passionate State of Mind that CBS rescheduled the 60-minute show for this week ( Tuesday , 10 p.m . ) . Though Eric Sevareid is the reporter of record , the program is Hoffer , the shirtsleeved philosopher from the San Francisco waterfront , whose aphorisms and world views have sold 700,000 books ( The True Believer , The Temper of Our Time ) and have produced disciples from the University of California 's Clark Kerr to Dwight Eisenhower . <P> On TV Hoffer , 65 , comes on with a muscular humanism that hymns ordinary people and the land that enthroned them . " The only new thing in history , " he says , " is America . It 's blasphemous to say that , you know , but it 's true . " And what is America 's contribution ? " The deproletarianization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He thinks he 's as good as everybody else . " Hoffer knows he is . " You can almost close your eyes , " he says , " reach over the sidewalk and make a man President , and he 'll turn out to be Truman . " That , in Hoffer 's eyes , is " terrific , breathtaking . " <P> Other salty notions : <P> &gt; On the U.S. in Viet Nam : " You do not start a world war when a democracy throws its weight around facing a bully . World wars are started when the democracies are too unprepared , too cowardly , too reasonable , too frightened , too tired , or too ' humanitarian . ' " <P> &gt; On the survival ability of modern nations : " If the President had picked me to predict which country in postwar Europe would recover first , I would say , ' Bring me the records of maintenance . ' The nation with the best maintenance will recover first . Maintenance is something very , very specifically Western . They have n't got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warehouse , let 's say , and I saw that the broom had a special nail , I would say , This is the nail of immortality . ' " <P> &gt; On Negro leadership : " The leaders of the Negro revolution have no faith in the Negro masses , no concern for them . When I hear Stokely Carmichael , he 's always asking , ' Give me the can opener , so I 'll open the cans of power and eat them . ' You waste your energies on demonstrations , on riots . They do not produce one atom of pride . You know the chemistry of pride , Mr. Sevareid ? Pride . This is what the Negro needs , see . Viet Nam is going to do to the Negro what Israel has done for the Jews . And if I was a Negro leader , I would pitch a tent on the water edge and grab those Negro veterans as they come back . They are the seed of the future . They are the kind of leaders that the Negro needs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't for the question of drugs , I would be all for the hippies , because it 's a healthy reaction against the rat race . And now with automation coming on there , see , we have to know how to enjoy leisure . " <P> &gt; On John Kennedy : " I had no feel for Kennedy at all . Kennedy was a European . All you have to do is tabulate how many times Kennedy crossed the Atlantic and how many times he crossed the Appalachian Mountains and you know where he belonged . "
