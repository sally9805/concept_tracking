txt Washington , Aug. 24 - A white paper prepared by House Republicans tonight laid the blame for the war in Viet Nam on the Kennedy and Johnson administrations . The paper stated : " When President Eisenhower left office , there was no crisis in South Viet Nam . " It repudiated President Johnson 's claim that he was carrying on what Eisenhower started and charged that there is no merit to Johnson 's repeated explanation that United States military involvement in Viet Nam is fulfilling an Eisenhower pledge of assistance . Move Up Release The 32-page paper was released 24 hours after a White House policy paper entitled " Why Viet Nam ? " traced the United States commitment back to Eisenhower . The G. 0 . P. paper originally was scheduled for release at 11 a. m. tomorrow , but Rep. Gerald Ford , the House leader , changed this when President Johnson called a press conference for 10 a. m. tomorrow . apparently in an attempt to take the play away from the Republicans . House Republican leaders passed word last week that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President beat them to the punch with his own yesterday .

Then after the establishment of a stable  --  and successful government in South Viet Nam during the Eisenhower years , the Democrats committed major errors that led to the present problems , the Republicans charged .

The President in several statements set limits to American participation in the Vietnamese conflict , including enlargement of the conflict and bombing North Viet Nam , the G. 0 . P. charged . " In Hanoi and Peiping , all this could be interpreted only as an assurance that they need not fear fuller use of the power of the United States in Viet Nam beyond the type of assistance provided to the South Vietnamese in the summer of 1964 , " the G. 0 . P. paper said . The Republicans quoted Secretary of State Dean Rusk as saying recently in a newspaper article : " Perhaps the Communist world misunderstood our Presidential campaign . " " Perhaps , indeed , it did , " the G. 0 . P. paper commented . " But whose fault was that ? "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
