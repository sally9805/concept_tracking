A Story by VED MEHTA CALL GIRL R A M woke with a heavy head , as though he had not slept at all . He stood or a long time under a hot shower ; in India there was no pressure to water , but in America the water burst out of the pipes , humming and ringing . Yes , he thought , he would do it this very night . After all , he had slept with Indian women . It was just a difference in the color of the skin , that was all . And from the way the faculty members talked at the refectory , the Empress of Silence had to be safe ; he had passed the bar-restaurant a number of times , and from the outside it always did look very dark . He dried himself with a big beach towel , first his thick , black hair , then his narrow , round shoulders , and finally , with swift , rotary motions , his back . Earlier that afternoon , Ram had returned as usual from teaching physics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for a little bit more money he could have had a better-lit apartment a little higher up , but Ram , while quite vain about that sort of thing , had decided to conserve a little money . He had dropped his shoes and socks in the foyer , and , mixing himself a tumbler of whiskey and soda from his new green drink cabinet and putting the glass on the night table beside the Princess phone which was beside his pillow , had stretched out on his bed . Teaching a section in America was far more tiring than lecturing to a hall full of students at Delhi University . Itwas not only that there everyone knew that at twenty-three he was the youngest and most promising theoretical physicist in the country , but somehow it was just easier to lecture to a class sprinkled with shy , demure girls in saris who , when listening to his jokes , sat at the edge of their seats , giggled easily , looked reverential after an especially good lecture . Once or twice he had started , thinking he heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd especially had an extra-loud telephone installed so that he would n't miss a call if he were taking a shower or was out in the hall waiting for the lift . But , as always , it was a false alarm . He was certain Angelica , who sat in the corner seat of the front row of his Columbia class  --  she had lovely green eyes and a very delicate nose  --  was interested in him . In fact , he knew by heart the addresses and telephone numbers of Angelica and the two other girls who inevitably appeared in all his classes . Often he had dialed their numbers , but hung up just short of the first ring . After all , he was a teacher , a professor . Propping himself up on the bed , he had drunk some whiskey and , as he had so many times before , dialed 411 . " Good afternoon . This is Information . " He felt sure that with the operator 's fresh voice went Angelica 's green eyes and delicate nose . " Operator , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He was the chair-man of Ram 's department , and had such a nice wile ; she had helped him buy all his " contemporary " furniture at B. Altman 8c Co . " Gerald W. Thompson ? " the operator asked . " Yes , Gerald W. Thompson , " he echoed . Actually , Ram knew their number . He also knew that the number was unlisted , but he liked talking to the operator . That was the reason why he had asked for Gerald W. Thompson 's number every day for the last four months , indeed from the very first week he had arrived in New York . The miraculous thing was that he never got the same operator twice . Surely if he had they would have recognized his thin , soft , foreign voice , and said , " I told you , sir , the number is unlisted . " But they never did . He did n't know where exactly the magnificent information service was situated , but he pictured it somewhere in the vast expanse of the Midwest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tall , and well-filled girls , dressed in orange , pink , and red , waiting to receive callers , plugs in hand . To his mathematical mind , nothing seemed easier than imagining a mechanism whereby calls from all over the country went to one enormous central exchange . If only each city had its own exchange , if only the central exchange were located in New York . Perhaps it . was somewhere in this city . Ile must make discreet inquiries . " Sorry , sir , " ? she was speaking to him ? " Mr. Thompson does have a telephone , but he does not wish his number listed . He has asked that the number be unlisted . " Reluctantly he had put down the receiver , and finally slept in fits and starts . Now , after drying himself thoroughly , he put on his best raw silk shirt and the trousers of his best suit , which his mother had especially ordered from Made-to-Order English Tailors in Delhi . He decided against the waistcoat  --  it would make him look too old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; his mother had loaded him with a collection of hand-knitted sweaters . There was a blue one with cables , a red one with snakes , and a gray one with sleeves . He slipped on , along with his waistcoat , the red sweater , fuller than the others and even , perhaps , a little flashy . He walked around the block of the Empress of Silence several I imes , glancing at all the menus of all the restaurants , letting his lips form the various items ? " Spaghetti Bolognese , " " Won Ton Soup " ? and then he sprinted into the dark portal of the iniquitous Empress of Silence . He expected , well , he did n't know what he expected . In Munich , where lie had broken his journey to America for a day , one of his fellow passengers on the plane , a tall , overpowering Sikh , J. J. Singh , had lured him to a street with places just like the Empress of Silence . Of this street , he only remembered countless German women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and big chests , sitting , lion-like , on thick wooden tables , their feet swinging in time to the music . Actually , he had been quite attracted to them , but their extraordinary feet had frightened him away . The endless rows of feet had appeared to him as alarming as the thunder of marching armies . When Ram 's eyes were adjusted to the dark-ness of the Empress of Silence , he surveyed the restaurant from his corner table . There were no rows of feet , only young and old people , boys and girls . He would n't have minded even his mother seeing him at the Empress of Silence . Mother , he thought , putting a forkful of shrimp curry into his mouth , he must write to her that night ; he felt wary again . In his first few letters he had told her all there was to tell . He had told her about New York buildings , the Columbia campus ; he had described meticulously the head of the private foundation which had made his visit possible , the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Altman purchases , the long sofa and the coffee table , even his telephone , the wallpaper in his bedroom . For the last three months he had had nothing new to tell her , but his mother nagged him for more news in letter after letter . With coffee arrived the " boss " of the restaurant-bar ; Ram had seen him in the mirror , shaking hands with several customers . Are you from India ? " the boss asked . His accent was good , his smile narrow and aristocratic . He did n't look any more a hustler than Ram , " Yes , " said Ram , and added in a rush of words , " I am in the Columbia Directory of Faculty , and I am certainly looking forward " ? according to the refectory gossip , these were the Arabian passwords ? " to meeting your friend . " Then , nonchalantly , the boss and he exchanged addresses . A T HOME , adjusting his tie and his silk handkerchief in his breast pocket in front of the mirror , he focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trample of elephantine feet , the telephone voice , and the green eyes of Angelica . Trying to keep the picture of Angelica in his mind , he experimented with various combinations of lights in his living room , seeing his apartment as she would see it . The lamp next to the sofa threw the light upward and was too glaring , the small Chinese lamp on his green cabinet was too dim , the overhead light was dreadful . The Chinese lamp was the best of the three , but if they started undressing on the sofa it would be too far away . He decided in favor of keeping the lamp beside the sofa burning and , sitting down beside it , he waited . The wait was unbearable . He rang up ' Ill a couple of times , and then an idea struck him . In the foyer of his apartment there was an intercom system ; if he held down the top button with his forefinger he could eavesdrop on the lobby below , and the friend 's voice talking to the doorman , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in half-an-hour of intercom waiting all lie heard was once or twice the sound of high heels and someone whistling . Indeed , she arrived on his doorstep suddenly , like an angel  --  unheralded ; her face reminded him of a basket of strawberries , her eyes were green , and her complexion white as fresh cream ? just like buttermilk , he thought . The scarf around her hair was supernaturally just like the silk handkerchief in his breast pocket . " Do you like cats ? " she asked , daintily sitting down on the sofa beside him , in a beautifully modulated voice . " No , I am a dog lover , " he said in a breath . " That 's the way it should be , " she said , her words coming like gentle raindrops . " Women should like cats , men should like dogs . " How poetic , he thought , how true . " Do you have a dog ? " He shook his head . " I could get you a dog very cheaply . Would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What would you like to drink ? " he said , in another single breath . " I do n't drink , " she said , " except some diluted stuff when I am at the Empress of Silence . Then I try to raise the tab for the boss . " " Tab , " he pondered , what a wonderful word . What could it mean ? There was a mystery about her . " How long have you been in this  --  career ? " he stuttered , even though he was certain that this was her first evening . Ved Mehra , a young writer born in India and educated in America and England , has written several books  --  most recently " Fly and Fly-Bottle : Encounters with British Intellectuals . " He is on the staff of " The New Yorker . " " I became a professional girl when I was sixteen , " she said , with her face full on him . She did n't look a day over seventeen , in fact she looked younger , much younger . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " I 've never done it . I mean about money and ... can I get you a drink ? " " Do n't be embarrassed , " she said , " I 'll have tomato juice if you want me to drink . " He brought her an iced glass of tomato juice , and handed it to her tenderly , affectionately . She took a sip and put it down on the coffee table . " Shall we talk for a while and then come to an arrangement later ? " That was so feminine ; women of his color would have bargained , as in a bazaar . They were coarse , but she was refined . " The boss said I could stay here for two hours , " she added , " so there is no hurry . " There was an uncomfortable silence . He could n't think of anything to say . " You teach at Columbia ? " He nodded . There was another silence . " Would you like to know how I became a professional girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , " she said , putting her hand on his knee , light as a feather , " I was a model in Los Angeles . " A girl from Hollywood ! " Mind you , I had a very good career ahead of me . " He was sure he had seen her picture somewhere . " A girl friend told me there were opportunities in New York , but when I first got here it was so lonely . . . " How he agreed with her , this city of glary lights and steely buildings and hard times , and this poor girl coining from three thousand miles . True , he had come ten thousand miles , but she was a girl . " I modeled in New York , " she was saying . " but modeling is hard work . Mind you , it 's difficult for a girl to make her way in the city . " " Very difficult , " he chanted after her , tears coming to his eyes . " You might think I became a professional " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for money , but I do n't give a flit about money . It 's only that money gives you freedom  --  it 's useful . " " Yes , yes , " he said , with intuitive understanding . " I mean , girls like me need money , and I tell you nineteen out of twenty girls would like to do exactly what I do , but they do n't have the nerve . " He had no doubt that she was the most courageous woman he had ever met . " You have a lot of nerve , too . Take the Duke Hotel . There must be hundreds of men A story by Ved Mehta 85 lying up there with nothing to do , but they do n't have the nerve , they do n't have the know-how . You do . " From the moment she walked in , he had known she was intuitive . " Like the Duke men , these other girls do n't have the know-how neither . I figure a man who can pay fifty to a thousand dollars  --  those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it takes a lot of nerve to go and meet strangers each time . " It was a cruel world which compelled these girls to meet strange men unescorted . The more she talked , the more comfortable he became . He really understood her . and she really understood him . " Would vou like to talk some more ? " she said , " or shall we make the arrangements now ? But " ? she answered her own questions ? " I see you are n't ready yet . " He leaned back on the sofa and just a little bit toward her also . Their shoulders touched . She went on talking and he , searching in his mind for an appropriate description of her voice and words , was already composing a letter about her to his mother  --  not , of course , about how they met , but about what a good friend she was to him . " Her voice , " he was writing in his mind , " is like a waterfall . Her words are sheer " ( he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instantly he was picturing her in his home in India . yes , she would certainly fit into the Family ; she was beautiful , courageous , and pliable . He was sure she was pliable . She had already learned to live away from home , that was important . The trouble with American and English girls whom other Innians brought back home as their wives was that they were forever talking about their " home . " They packed their bags at the first contact with adversity , but by her own admission she was one out of twenty . His mathematical mind raced ahead , looking at the number one out of twenty from all angles . " One billion out of twenty billion ? " No , that was unrealistic . " Twenty million out of four hundred million  --  India 's population : " That was too many , twenty million was a large number , but then it only covered one of her virtues . Hcr other virtues were far rarer , he was sore . " I started working as a professional , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on East Sixty-third Street " ? just like Indial ? " but the place was busted . " " What do you mean ? " he asked , becoming bold . " Boy , " she said , " the amount of payola and kickback . You may buy out the wise guys , you may even buy out the precinct , but that does n't prevent the coppers " ? he heard " conquerors " ? " from downtown from grabbing you , in election time , specially . A Broadway or a Harlem girl , she 's taken in two or three times a season , us girls are taken in only once in a blue moon . Say you and I are sitting here as cozy as a couple of ducks , and one of those conquerors breaks in ? " " You do n't have anything to won-v about , " he said . " I would protect you . " " Listen , " she said , with mounting excitement in her voice , " suppose one of those conquerors walks in , and better yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a hundred dollar bill is lying on this table . Even after the conqueror has seen the bill , he ca n't pin anything on me  --  I could be your beloved , and the money for the groceries . But the conqueror takes me in just to build up a little pressure . And then they start lighting a fire under you too . The conquerors say they 'll tell Columbia . Now everybody in Columbia is making out like you are , but you are not to know . So you may take a little panic . ' What will the chairman say ? ' you think . " She knew the chairman ? " But the chairman is human , ai n't he ? So it the man 's a cad and a coward " ? Ram was sure he was neither ? " he spills the beans . A girl takes that chance , and she might be clamped up for a bit . But most men , you know , are honorable They either do n't turn up in court when they 're asked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the honorable thing to do , you know . " " Exactly , exactly , " Ram said . He did n't really understand what she was saying , but his mind was already at work on conquerors and beans and seasons and beloved and an honorable and gallant man , and swimming before his eyes were acres and acres of cornfields in Punjab , ripe for eating , and his dear friend was in the field and the Genghis Khan himself with troops as thick as ants , but he , Ram , was fighting all of them single-handed , with his honor and gallantry in the balance . But these bustups only come once in a blue moon , " she was saying . He immediately switched off the glaring light beside him and , by pulling the string to his hand , raised the blinds . Moonlight streamed in . What premonition , what tact she had ! I A M N 0 T " ? her lovely blond head was now gently resting on his shoulder ? " one of those B-girls . " Bees began buzzing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I mean , if you are a B-girl , there are first these introductions  --  and the host always plays favorites  --  then you have to drink a couple of hours with the customer to raise the tab , and then finally when you are out in the street with him he 's half high . This way is much better , is n't it , honey ? Now the boss could have called a hundred different girls , but he chose me . " A hundred different girls . What good luck . He wondered if she were Aries like him . " But the boss called me , " she repeated . " I like skinny men , " she said , running her hand along his thin neck . You do n't have an ounce of fat on you . " Tears of exquisite sadness and exquisite happiness rolled down his large cheeks . " Have you ever thought of marriage ? " he asked . She did n't draw back . " You see , " she said , " I have a four-and-a-halfmonth-old baby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but then I ask myself , ' Will they be a good father to my baby ? ' And **44;1892;TOOLONG cent of the time , the answer is no . " Ram 's mathematical mind considered his chances . He was oneIndian  --  out of a million in New York . He was so sure he would be a good father . " Is it a girl ? " he asked . " How did you know ? " she said . " How did you ever know ? You Indians kill me . " With watery eyes , he started telling her how his father had died when he was three , how his mother had seen him through boarding schools and universities , how he owed everything to her , and how much he loved her . He had n't talked this way to anyone since he 'd come to America , and his friend was such a good listener . When he had finished , she said , " Hey , shall we make the arrangements now ? What is it going to be , once or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't know if he had divined her meaning , but if it meant a hundred dollars for her and that baby , then it certainly was going to be twice . He gravely , ceremoniously , pressed five twenty-dollar bills into her beautifully lined hand  --  exactly the way he had pressed , two years before , his first month 's salary into his mother 's hand . For him , it was not a transaction of money , but of feeling , and its significance was not lost on Rani . Carelessly depositing the money in her purse , she turned to him . " ' Will you promise me something ? " she said . He nodded . " Would you get me a Buddha hat ? I 'll pay you for it . I 've asked so many friends , and they 've all promised  --  the rats  --  but none of diem has come through with my Buddha hat . " " I will , " Ram said eagerly , and then added , puzzled , " But what is a Buddha hat ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear ? ? they come to a point at the top . " She swept her hands around and over his head , making them into the shape of a cone . " Johnny , he was really a very good guy , told me that these dancers in the East are very possessive about them , and it takes a great deal of know-how to lift one . Could you get it for me ? " He said he would . " Will you call me every week ? " she said . " I do n't know whether I can afford it , " he said . " Yes , you can afford it , we 'll go for fifty next time , " she said . " Or if you ca n't afford it next week , call me the week after that , but do it before Thanksgiving . I 'm going to Pittsburgh then for a few days . Would you like to unzip me , honey ? " With shaking fingers , his eyes averted , he unzipped her dress . He stole a glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushing her skirt above her thighs , and started undoing her stockings .
