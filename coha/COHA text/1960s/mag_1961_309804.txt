" I do not think it altogether inappropriate for me to introduce myself , " said the President of the U.S. to members of the Paris press . " I am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris . " President Kennedy was not exaggerating : in the eyes of the world , his talks with Charles de Gaulle might take on historic significance , but to the people of Paris their deliberations were secondary . From the moment of her smiling arrival at Orly Airport , the radiant young First Lady was the Kennedy who really mattered . <P> As the presidential motorcade made its way through the jammed , flag-draped streets , great crowds of people pressed close to her limousine for a glimpse . A 101-gun salute shook the city and was all but drowned out by the rousing cry , " Vive Jacqueline ! ' ' <P> Alexandre &; Nathalie . Jackie 's conquest of Paris was no haphazard campaign . No summit conference was more carefully planned than the First Lady 's return to the city she had come to love as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidential luggage was a blinding array of gowns and jewels-and in making her plans . Jackie was keenly conscious of the fact that no tiny sag or hemline or stray strand of hair would escape the notice of the style-conscious people of Paris . <P> In May , Alexandre , the city 's leading hairdresser , received a top-secret letter from the White House with a lock of Jackie 's hair enclosed , and a request for his services during the forthcoming visit ( see MODERN LIVING ) . To the Parisian branch of the cosmetician Harriet Hubbard Ayer went another urgent request , mustering out Europe 's leading makeup expert , Nathalie , for the duration of the Kennedy trip . <P> On her first night in Paris , Jackie was dressed , coifed and made up as elaborately as any princess . When she emerged from her bedroom at the Palais des Affaires Etrangeres , she was magnificent in a narrow , pink-and-white straw-lace gown and a swooping 14th century hairdo with a fake topknot . Even John Kennedy , a man who is not notably attentive to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " I 'm dazzled . " <P> So was everyone else . At an intimate luncheon for 40 at the Elyse Palace , President de Gaulle had only perfunctory greetings for Jean Gavin , wife of the <P> American ambassador , on his left , scarcely touched the elaborate lunch that was laid before him . Seated at his right , Jacqueline zeroed in with a flashing smile and began to speak in her low , slow French . <P> The glacial Charles de Gaulle promptly melted . It was not the first time Jackie had worked her magic on the French President ; last year , during his trip to Washington . De Gaulle observed with a sigh : " If there were anything I could take back to France with me , it would be Mrs. Kennedy . "
