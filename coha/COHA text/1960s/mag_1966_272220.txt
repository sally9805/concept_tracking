Little Lebanon , an oasis of stability and old-fashioned economic freedom in the impoverished and riotous Middle East , prospers not only by trade but as a money market . In less than two decades , its bustling capital of Beirut has grown into the world 's newest financial center , the shrewd regional banker to everybody from wealthy Arab sheiks to huge U.S. oil companies . Last week , in a crisis that shook the country 's fiscal structure to the bottom of its vaults , Lebanon was forced to shut its 93 banks for three days . <P> The trouble began when Intra Bank , the country 's largest , ran out of cash to meet a run of withdrawals and closed its doors-perhaps forever . Among Lebanese , shock spread as it might in the U.S. if a dozen giant banks and industries collapsed together . Intra held 38% of the deposits in Lebanese-owned banks . It owned nine other banks , four of them in Lebanon . It controlled 35 companies , including Beirut 's largest hotel and thriving Middle East Airlines , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a metalworks ; in all , it employed 43,000 persons who with their dependents comprise a tenth of the country 's population . Abroad , Intra 's twelve branches spread from New York to Nigeria , its holdings from a French shipyard to a 27-story office skyscraper on Manhattan 's Fifth Avenue . <P> Belated Pledge . Ironically , Intra was far from insolvent , with more than $230 million in assets against $170 million in liabilities . But too much was tied up in risky long-term investments , depriving the bank of needed cash . Predictably , Intra 's closing started a run that threatened to bankrupt other Beirut banks . At a twelve-hour emergency night session , the Lebanese Cabinet ordered a three-day bank holiday to stall for time . To avert another kind of panic , Beirut 's stock exchange also closed . So did department stores and shops , bringing business in the city close to a standstill . Finally , the government pledged its $200 million reserves ( mostly in gold ) to bail out all the banks but Intra , which it feared might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reopened , the panic subsided . <P> Authorities abroad closed Intra 's branches in Paris , London and Frankfurt . New York 's state banking superintendent seized control of the Manhattan branch to protect its depositors . When the three largest U.S. banks ( Bank of America , Chase Manhattan and First National City ) defied the superintendent 's demand to turn over $2,529,000 of Intra deposits-on the ground that the defunct bank owed them more than that elsewhere-he sued for the money . Some bankers fear that this wrangle could lead to retaliation against U.S. banks abroad .
