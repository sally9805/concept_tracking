Time : Present . Place : On or near the street in a crowded neighborhood . The stage is bare except for a garbage can , a crate , tin cans , rubbish . Since the stage is a sidewalk , people are moving along as they talk , except where indicated . At Rise : Louie enters , his eyes half shut . He is slightly bent over ; he nods , sighs , scratches his chest , and sits down peacefully on the garbage can at Left , then lights a cigarette and drags slowly . MUSIC starts before his entrance and goes down softly . MARC ( runs on ; he is younger than Louie ; gives the stage a glance , then turns and yells Offstage , Right ) . Hey , Hum ! We can do it here . There 's plenty of room . Go get a broom . ( He turns shyly to Louie . ) Hi , Louie.  --  Hi , we 're going to dance , man . ( Louie does n't move . Marc dances to hide his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  this is crazy . Just wait till I get my little head . Hi , Louie ! Hey , get a doll , man .

( He fixes the place , moves a crate , finds an old broom with the handle broken off , dances to the MUSIC and begins to brush tin cans into a pile next to the garbage can . ) Louie ! Hey ! Move , man , remember how you used to dance ? ( Tries to dance like Louie . ) Hey , come on . You tore it up . ( Louie pays no attention . ) Hey . Hey , Louie  --  LOUIE !

LOUIE Ah  --  what you talking about ? ( MUSIC : up and strong . Marc and the Dancers begin to enter , Right . The MUSIC , discordant and ominous , has a strong beat and is full for about two minutes . Everyone dances  --  several couples  --  not all at the same time . They talk or greet Louie while each couple in turn takes Center Stage . Louie takes one or two half-hearted steps at their encouragement , then stops and looks out and away up at the sky . A hiccupping is heard in the beat of the MUSIC . The Dancers lose themselves in a wild dance with clapping and shouts . As the MUSIC begins to fade , they leave one by one , and Hum and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 4 HUM ( talks silently with Marc . They glance at Louie a couple of times and then : ) Go ahead  --  ask him .

LOUIE ( shrugs ) . A pound . It depends . HUM ( whistles ) . For one of them pills ? LOUIE Not pill , man . Bag ! Bag ! MARC Wow ! That 's a lot of dough , man . How often you have to take it ?

Everybody says it , and I just thought  --  LOUIE Man , if I wanted , I could stop just like that . Sure . MARC Have you tried ? LOUIE ( pauses ) . Why should I ? ( Shrugs . ) HUM I heard it takes ten years off your life . LOUIE So ? Who wants to live a hundred years around here in this  --  this  --  cage ! ( The word turns him on . ) HUM That stuff must do a lot for you . LOUIE Man , it does . A cage ! Ssh , do n't interrupt . I 'm seeing it . This whole jungle , all of it , man , inside a cage . Everything wild  --  mashed flat and stuffed into this cage . And look at them  --  all these faces , thousands of faces in there flattened out and dead , man  --  and one or two soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too  --  their heads hanging out , trying to sneak through  --  or breathe . Yeah  --  Porse and them are in there , too . They 're all in there . We 're all inside ! ( Pause . ) See  --  once you take it , man , you can see what is a cage and what ai n't  --  and you can get free , free of all this ace-king-and-queen crap , free like a bird way up there that flies up , up , up and busts itself right through space . . . . That 's what it is . No troubles , nobody telling you where you 're at , no kids running around loose , no women yelling . ( Sighs . ) Yeah . No women yelling . p. 7 MARC Oh , man . . . . Well , what do they do ? LOUIE What do you mean what do they do ? HUM If they do n't yell . LOUIE Oh , they come around and they 're nice to you . They stroke you , like  --  ( Imitates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) They look at you and they LISTEN . Yeah , they look at you while you  --  Oh  --  you can talk  --  like you got a gold tongue in your mouth . You just never heard yourself talk till then  --  the words ooze  --  and you can just get anybody wrapped around your toe . Just tell them  --  ! ( Marc and Hum laugh . ) Tell them climb in a rathole and they just about do it . HUM Say , man , that sounds all right . ( Marc yells and jumps . ) LOUIE I could tell you lots of things . You know Celee ? ( Hum suddenly grabs Marc and whispers . ) MARC Yeah  --  once would n't hurt . LOUIE Yeh , Celee sings right out so pretty when I come home high , feeling good . ( Stops . ) She used to . She ai n't done it for a while . Ah , but when she sings , my head buzzes , man . ( Scratches. ) p. 8 MARC Uh  --  Louie ? LOUIE Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some myself .

You understand me ? See  --  I done give you warning . Well  --  ( He moves off with Louie . ) I 'll meet you at the place , five or ten minutes . ( Louie holds him back . ) Yeah  --  I 'll have some for them , too . LOUIE Come on  --  sometimes you 're late . Sometimes you do n't come at all . Make it right now .

Thanks , Porse . Thanks ! See you . Five  --  ten minutes ! ( Porse exits , Left . Louie starts back to the Boys , then suddenly plays it cool and waits for them . They wait but finally walk over to him . ) HUM Well ? ( Louie nods . ) MARC Will he let us ? LOUIE You 're in . Now remember , you 're my customers , see ? We 'll get it and then go to where I keep my works and get fixed together . ( Celee enters , Right . ) Man , there ai n't nothing like it . MARC ( points behind Louie ) . Sssh  --  there 's your sister . ( Celee sees Louie and puts her head down , trying to go by without being noticed . ) LOUIE Celee  --  ! Celee ? What you doing out ? You know  --  not till you 're sixteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LOUIE ( disarmed , then guilty ) . Oh . . . . ( Pause . Sudden anger . ) Where you going ? p. 12 CELEE ( looks at him ) .

LOUIE ( shouts ) . You do n't need to . CELEE ( softly ) . You did n't have to bring a present . LOUIE ( shouts ) . Beat it . Go home . ( He turns to the Boys . ) Hey , itch my back , man . ( Celee continues Left and exits , Left . ) Hey what 's the matter with her ? She walking funny ? MARC ( To Hum ) . Like that hophead , Jenny ? ( He and Hum laugh . ) LOUIE ( grabbing him ) . You talk that way about my sister and I 'll  --  ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm kidding you , man . ( MUSIC begins low . ) LOUIE ( Goes Left and watches her disappear ) . Celee ! Hey , CELEE ! ( He turns back , not noticing the Boys . ) What I do now ? ( Marc and Hum whisper , look at Louie and exit , Right . MUSIC comes up slowly . Louie does n't know whether to follow Celee or the Boys  --  whether to see about her or get his customers before they are gone . The conflict makes him feel his need for more drugs . He wipes his eyes and nose . ) I have a terrible feeling . ( MUSIC comes up full . He looks in all pockets for a coin . Pulls one out and tosses it ) Oh no ! ( He throws one more look in Celee 's direction and runs off , Right . Offstage he yells . ) Hey wait , you guys . I 'm coming ! ( MUSIC stays up . A Drunk enters and stumbles across the Stage from Right to Left . Porse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm trying to say is  --  and all you need to do is  --  give me a chance . That 's all . That 's all I 'm asking . PORSE ( enjoying himself ) . But why  --  why pick on me , baby ? I got my hands full , you know . So to speak . Why me ? p. 14 CELEE ( knowing his number ) . Well  --  every girl on this block . PORSE ( pleased ) . Yeah ? CELEE Sure they do . Talking about you all the time . PORSE Why , baby ? Why is that ? CELEE ( change ) . Look  --  you want to know the truth ? PORSE Well  --  I do n't know , sweetheart  --  that depends . Sometimes  --  like right now  --  I do n't . CELEE Well , see ?  --  you know my brother , Lou ?

With emphasis . ) And everybody know Jenny . ( Pause . ) Do n't you see ? PORSE And  --  what about your brother ?  --  Who 's your brother ? CELEE ( quietly ) . Never mind .

That part ai n't your business and never will be . ( Kindly . ) See ? p. 16 PORSE ( intrigued ) . Um . Now wait a minute . ( He studies her . Taps his foot . Looks at his watch . Looks up and down the street . Then smiles , turns away and gets a couple of bills from his wallet . ) Here  --  go get yourself some clothes . ( Celee hesitates . ) Go on  --  take it . What 's the matter with it ? ( She still hesitates . ) Look , baby  --  besides looks , you 've got fight . That 's what I like . I do n't know why . I do n't like to fight  --  but I like  --  fight . Understand ? CELEE ( suddenly takes the money ) . Well ?  --  what do I do ? PORSE ( laughs ) . Nothing  --  if you do n't want to . Think about it .  --  But come on . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , and the  --  well , come on  --  I 'll show you a place right now  --  see if you feel like trying it .  --  Oh baby  --  I 'm feeling young again . ( As they exit . ) I 'm going to open a new world to you . ( MUSIC up . Drunk re-enters from Left and takes a longer time getting off . He tries to fight an imaginary passerby , wants company , or makes dumbshow conversation with someone in the audience . Takes a swig from his bottle , looks into garbage can , etc. , then exits. ) p. 17 LOUIE ( runs in from Right . He looks around wildly . To audience ) . Hey , have you seen Porse ? He was just here . Have you seen Porse ? ( To someone in audience . ) Yeah , Porse ! You know him . Have you seen him ?  --  the guy with the brown coat ?  --  or those other two guys ?

No. p. 19 LOUIE Show me your ARM ! ( He grabs her arm and pushes up the sleeve and sees the needle mark . ) Celee ! Celee ! PORSE You like it , Louie . LOUIE You took it , Celee . You took it . CELEE You took it , Louie . LOUIE ( slaps Celee ) . Oh , Celee ! ( Slaps her again , calling her name . ) Celee ! CELEE Porse ! PORSE ( pushes them apart , and Louie struggles to get at her ) .

Louie throws Porse down , then Porse trips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck . ) PORSE ( brushing himself off ) . Wait a minute , man . What you trying to do ? Gone off your bat ? p. 20 LOUIE ( beginning to pick himself up slowly ) . Porse ? How  --  how long ? How long has she  --  ? PORSE You want to know something ? LOUIE ( interrupting ) . How long ! How many times ? ( Louie has begun to moan and strike himself  --  his chest , his head . ) PORSE ( taking all this in ) . Oh  --  nuts . ( Pause . ) Hey , look  --  listen to me , man , you better watch out . Do n't worry about Celee  --  she 's gone home . And do n't get hung up  --  you 're just a little sick , that 's all . Look , I 'm a right guy . She 's your sister  --  LOUIE ( softly ) . No . PORSE No ? You say no ? That 's good . ( He laughs , but then is very thoughtful . ) You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Celee than have some stuff ? LOUIE ( softly ) . I am going to kill you , man .

( Louie does n't move . His eyes are wild . Porse mimics Louie . ) " Please , Porse , lay off , will you . Please , PLEASE , Porse , give me some stuff . " Right , Louie ? p. 21 LOUIE ( his shoulders sag ; he breaks ) . Oh . PORSE But you want to be the main man , do n't you ? LOUIE ( screams ) . Lay off it ! PORSE ( knows his game ; takes out his watch , looks at it ) . Well , I ca n't be messing around here all day . I got to go . Take it light , man .

LOUIE No more after this . No more . p. 22 PORSE Will you stay out of my hair ? LOUIE Yeah , I will , I will . PORSE Where 's your money ? LOUIE Here 's a buck . ( Tears it out of his pocket . Gives it to Porse , who looks at it and drops it with scorn . ) PORSE That do n't cover it . LOUIE I 'll get it , I swear I 'll get it . PORSE Sssh  --  shut up , man .

MUSIC up . Louie walks quickly around the stage . He is frantically hurried , yet careful . From a hiding place , he pulls out an old cigarette pack in which his works are stored . He squats down , picks up the dollar , keeps watch . He opens the small cellophane bag , empties the powder into a soft drink bottle cap , adds a little water and lights a match under it . He attaches a needle to the eyedropper and soaks the fluid up through a bit of cotton . He takes off his belt and tightens it around his arm and waits with great impatience for his vein to bulge . He sticks in the needle , has difficulty getting it into the vein . He mutters . ) Hit it . Hit it hard . Go home , goddam you , go home . ( As it finally goes in , his head goes back suddenly as a rush of relief floods him . ) Oh Mm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daylight to blue . Important Note : All of the following action is in slow motion  --  as if in water  --  until the next light change . Louie pulls out the needle . He slowly takes it apart and stores it in the cigarette packet and hides it again . Then with a great sigh he begins to move across stage , his jaw hanging open . He sits , nodding , on a garbage can . Celee enters and floats past him , dropping her handkerchief at his feet . He slowly picks it up and returns it to her . A Dream Man enters and heads for Celee . She struggles as he tries to kiss her . Louie pulls him around and they fight , and Louie slowly knocks him down . As in slow motion film fights , the Man 's face crumples . Louie gets rid of him and bids Celee farewell as she exits . Then Porse appears  --  also part of Louie 's imagination . Louie has begun to wander back and forth looking for Celee and calling out her name , slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a rope to the front of Louie 's belt . Then slowly he pulls it out , umbilical like , to its full length  --  the width of the stage . As Louie seeks Celee , he slowly winds himself up in the rope until he is face to face with Porse . Porse laughs , tucks in the rope and hauls Louie Downstage before the audience . Shouting like a barker , in slow motion . ) Jun-kie ! Blow  --  your  --  horn . ( Louie imitates a horn . Porse talks over Louie 's sounds . ) The  --  law  --  will  --  get  --  you . p. 23 LOUIE ( like a siren ) . **30;242;TOOLONG . PORSE ( talking over Louie ) . The  --  cats  --  will  --  kill  --  the  --  dogs . ( Louie meows and barks . Porse is enjoying himself . ) Kiss  --  my  --  foot . ( Louie kneels down and slowly does so . Porse . ) Now  --  the  --  other  --  one . ( Louie looks up at Porse before doing it . Porse lifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd . ) Ladies  --  and gentlemen .  --  Step  --  right  --  up .

LOUIE ( Screaming out slowly as if in a nightmare . ) Mama ! ( MUSIC up . Porse unwinds Louie like a top and exits . Louie sinks slowly to the sidewalk . MUSIC down . LIGHTS change back to daylight . Ordinary movement is resumed . A Woman with a sack of groceries comes down the street with a little girl , Crezell. ) p. 24 WOMAN ( sees Louie and shakes her head ) . Things is just getting worse and worse . Crezell ! ( The little Girl goes to look at Louie . ) Crezell , come along . You hear me ? ( To herself or audience . ) Ca n't let children out of your sight one minute . Crezell ! Get away from there , you hear me ? CREZELL Mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WOMAN He sick all right .

( Gives her a smack and pulls her off . ) CREZELL Waah . He hurt himself . ( Boxed . ) Ow ! You never let me do nothing . ( Yanked . ) Wah . ( They exit . ) LOUIE ( wakes , stretches painfully and groans . Suddenly feels in his pockets  --  they are empty except for the dollar ) . He give me bad stuff  --  garbage ! ( Suddenly closes his eyes . ) If you thought hard enough maybe you could just think yourself into it . ( Tries to remember . ) Say  --  what was it happened to me . Let 's see  --  that 's funny . ( He feels around himself as if he still felt the rope . ) A rope  --  I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Porse is . Porse ? Porse  --  had that rope around me . That 's funny , very funny . He was laughing with that grin  --  gives you the creeps sometimes . Porse had that rope and then I got wound up . Going back and forth I got wound up , bound up  --  and there I was  --  at the end of this goddam  --  rope , dancing like some APE . And then ! then he called me  --  He told me  --  Oh God  --  he told me to kiss his  --  his oh no , his dirty rotting  --  Oh no , no , NO ! And I  --  so help me , I did !

Am I trapped ? p. 25 WOMAN ( entering with laundry bag ) . Louie , Louie , what 's the matter with you , honey ? LOUIE Maybe I 'm trapped . WOMAN What you mean , trapped ?

WOMAN You might just as well save yourself the trouble . LOUIE ( maddened , he shouts her Offstage ) . GO AWAY ! ( Tries now to think clearly . ) Now  --  ! If  --  if I am trapped  --  if I am trapped  --  yeah  --  let me feel walls , four walls and a ceiling around me , and bars . And if I 'm at the end of a ROPE !  --  then let me feel AIR beneath these feet . ( Stamps his boot hard . ) But  --  but if  --  Oh Jesus !

LOUIE There ai n't no free shot , man . p. 27 MARC Yeah ? But  --  ? LOUIE ( painfully trying to continue his thought ) . But  --  but if I ai n't trapped  --  NOT trapped  --  if the walls ai n't yet closed around me , and my feet still feel this load  --  then  --  ( He reaches for something hard to grasp . ) Then  --  ? MARC ( whispers ) . Louie ? LOUIE WHAT !  --  Go away , man , you 're bugging me . MARC What 's wrong ? LOUIE ( turns on him ) . Yeah . Now make it , man . Leave me alone !

( Cries out . ) Why , why should I turn around now and go the other way after so long ? Why ? ( He holds his head . ) Ooooooouh . ( MUSIC begins thinly , builds louder and deeper , becomes very intense . Louie clutches his head , stomach , falls , rolls , gets up . ) God ! Oh God ! Help me , man , help me ! p. 28 PORSE ( enters ) . Hi , Louie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this voice , then pulls back ) . Go away . PORSE What 's up , man ? LOUIE I 'm telling you . Go away .
