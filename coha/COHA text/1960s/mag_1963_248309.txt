For 35 years , Roy Roberts ' throne has stood at the far end of the newsroom of the Kansas City Star , as immovable a fixture as Roberts ' 200 Ibs . But last week , with a regal grace , the Star 's president and executive editor eased both his bulk and his throne 10 ft. to the right . Into his old place moved Roberts ' anointed successor : Editor Richard B. Fowler , a quiet , unassuming man of 60 who has spent 32 years in Roy Roberts ' considerable shade . <P> Like most royal successions , the Star 's was likely to change little more than the names on the palace stationery . " Hell , I was hand-raised by Roy , " said Fowler , a Sedalia , Mo. , farm boy who sold poultry before coming to the Star as a reporter in 1930 . " I do n't think I could separate my own ideas from his . " <P> <P> Such sentiments do not qualify Fowler as a yes man but as a pragmatist , who understands that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mr. Kansas City . In fact , Dick Fowler 's first editorial command , after trying out a chair designed for Roy Roberts ' ample posterior , was to call for a smaller size . " It pushes forward too much , " he said . " I 'd rather not fight it . " Fowler later explained what this really meant : " Nobody 's going to replace Roy Roberts . He 's not the type that fades away . " <P> Fowler was expressing an eminently practical view . Having escalated himself to the title of board chairman , Roy Roberts served immediate notice that he has no intention of playing figurehead . " I 'm going to get out from underfoot a while , " he said as he prepared to leave for a ten-week cruise of the Pacific . " I do n't want to be breathing down the necks of the new team as they take over . But I 'll be back , do n't worry about that . I 'll just ooze in the back door to keep an eye on things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry you out . "
