Last week , Prime Minister Lai Bahadur Shastri made the first change in his Cabinet since he took office 18 months ago . It was no minor matter . Out went T. T. ( for Tiruvallur Thattai ) Krishnamachari , 66 , Shastri 's strong-willed Minister of Finance . <P> Technically , T.T.K. quit . In fact , he was sacked for possessing a personality incompatible with those of Shastri and his other ministers . A brilliant , impatient holdover from Nehru 's Cabinet , Krishnamachari ran the country 's finances as a one-man show , imposed harsh restrictions on the foreign firms in India , and conducted a running fight with the World Bank , which criticized his policies as too restrictive . Contemptuous of his colleagues , he called one minister a " constipated cockroach , " advised another to return to teaching , and held back on allocations of foreign exchange for much needed fertilizer largely out of dislike for Food Minister Chidambaram Subramaniam . <P> Last month eleven members of Parliament introduced a resolution charging that T.T.K. had used his office to advance the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to personally exonerate him of the accusation . Shastri stalled , suggesting that the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court ought to examine the matter . Enraged , the Finance Minister walked in for a showdown . " You are not indispensable , " said Shastri . Replied Krishnamachari : " I should have quit when Nehru died . " <P> T.T.K. leaves behind an unfinished budget for fiscal 1967 and a legacy of bitterness among both foreign and domestic businessmen . If few of them understood the nightmarish problems that any Indian Finance Minister has to cope with , most still held high hopes for their fortunes under the new man , Calcutta Lawyer Sachindra Chaudhuri , who was expected to take a far more flexible approach . Indeed , on news of a change in the post , shares on the Indian stock exchanges staged a brisk rally .
