Since Election Day , Vice President Richard Nixon had virtually retired-by his own wish-from public view . But with the convening of the new Congress , he was the public man again , presiding over the Senate until John Kennedy 's Inauguration . One day last week , Nixon faced a painful constitutional chore that required him to officiate " at a joint session of Congress to hear the official tally of the Electoral College vote , and then to make " sufficient declaration " of the election of the man who defeated him in the tight 1960 presidential election . Nixon fulfilled his assignment with grace , then went beyond the required " sufficient declaration . " <P> " This is the first time in 100 years that a candidate for the presidency announced the result of an election in which he was defeated , " * he said . " Those who lose accept the verdict and support those who win . " Nixon thereupon offered his " heartfelt best wishes " to Kennedy and Johnson . When he had finished , House Speaker Sam Rayburn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever applauded during his tenure as House Speaker . The Congress and the galleries exploded with the kind of ovation that belongs to a good loser who makes a gracious gesture . <P> In the waning days of his spectacular years on Capitol Hill , Nixon was bombarded with offers of jobs from three foundations , four universities and schools ( including the University of Chicago ) , and " innumerable " corporations and law firms . He has declined them , will return to California to practice law , then ease back into the political scene in 1962 , stumping the nation on behalf of G.O.P. candidates . As he sees things now , he probably will not run for Governor of California against Democratic Incumbent Edmund ( " Pat " ) Brown . But Nixon will keep himself in the public eye by writing articles and making speeches-has , in fact , received hundreds of requests for both in the past two months . <P> With the endorsement of 34 million voters and the imminent retirement of Dwight Eisenhower from politics , Richard Nixon is the acknowledged leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its presidential nominee again in four years . But , says a Nixon man : " Dick is a hell of a long way from deciding about 1964 . " <P> * In 1861 Vice President John Breckinridge confirmed the election of his opponent , Abraham Lincoln .
