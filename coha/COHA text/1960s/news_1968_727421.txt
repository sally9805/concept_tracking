txt That rugged little space probe , Pioneer VI , is about to move behind the sun . And American space trackers hope to use the amazingly long-lived craft to learn a bit more about the sun 's atmosphere . Launched Dec. 16 , 1965 , Pioneer VI was to gather data on interplanetary space for about six months . It has gone on doing its job for nearly three years without even having to shift to its backup radio transmitter . Now it 's going to give scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory a bonus . Its orbit will carry it behind the sun Nov. 21 through Nov. 24 . As it disappears and reappears , JPL trackers will watch what happens to its radio signals . They can get a measure of electron density in the sun 's atmosphere from the way these signals change as they pass through it . This will be an added bit of service for a gallant craft that has demonstrated the quality American space engineers build into their products . Speaking of added service , JPL trackers hope to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probes they plan to launch next February and March . After photographing the red planet in early August , the Mariners are to cruise along an orbit that passes behind the sun . Then they may help test Einstein 's famed theory of general relativity . The theory predicts that light or radio waves would be slowed down and bent in their course when they pass close by a massive body such as the sun . The accuracy with which space trackers can keep tabs on the Mariners should enable them to see whether or not the spacecraft appear to be displaced as they pass behind the sun . If they do , this would indicate bending of the radio beams used in tracking . Changes in radio signals sent between the craft and the ground would reflect changes in radio-wave speed due to solar gravity . Astronomers tracking stars near the sun during solar eclipses think they have detected the light-bending Einstein predicted . But their observations are uncertain . Military research and development is hurting for lack of money . Washington 's budget squeeze is causing the first Pentagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next June , 6,000 jobs must go . Some 2,000 civilian employees  --  many of them scientists and engineers  --  will be given separation notices . The remaining 4,000 jobs will be accounted for by not filling them as they open up . The trimback of military R &D; jobs is par of a government-wide cut of civilian emljloyment under orders from Congress to get back to the level of June 30 , 1966 . This means that a total of 244,000 jobs must be chopped . The Navy intends to abolish 2,390 positions in 15 research centers now employing 23,902 civilians . Biggest Navy reduction-416 jobs  --  will be at the China Lake , Calif. , Naval Weapons Center which employs 4,157 . The Air Force must slash hardest , cutting 3,489 jobs from the 22,421 at its 26 research centers . The Army is spared the ax this time . It 's below its 1966 civilian level of 37,788 civilians in R &D; jobs . 0 Which trio of American astronauts will make it first to the moon ? With a manned lunar landing only a year off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculation . The grapevine connecting these centers has it that the backup crews already named for the three manned flights  --  Apollo 7 ( this month ) , Apollo 8 ( December ) , and Apollo 9 ( March ) ? will be the prime crews for shots 10 , 11 , 12 . Since the space agency says it does n't see a manned moon landing before Apollo 11 , or more probably 12 , these now appear to be the astronauts who will get there first : Neil Armstrong , Edwin Aldrin , and Fred Haise  --  backup crew for Apollo 8 and expected to be prime crew for Apollo 11 ; or Charles Conrad , Richard Gordon , and Alan Bean  --  backup crew for Apollo 9 and prime crew for Apollo 12 . How and why ... Computers have long since joined the fight against crime . Now experts in Britain 's Home Office , using an advanced electronic scanner , are trying to work out a system by which computers will recognize fingerprints . If they succeed , it would cut down on the vast amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar effort is going forward , with police cooperation , at Strathclyde University , in Glasgow .
