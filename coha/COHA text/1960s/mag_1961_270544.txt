Elizabeth Taylor has been signed on as Mary Magdalene . Rumors have Marlon Brando as Judas , Spencer Tracy as Pontius Pilate . But last week Director George Stevens released the biggest casting news of the Hollywood year : Swedish Actor Max von Sydow , 31 , has been chosen to play Jesus Christ in The Greatest Story Ever Told . One of the ablest members of Ingmar Bergman 's close-knit film and theater team , Von Sydow was the mysterious hero of The Magician , the God-haunted knight in The Seventh Seal , the avenging father in The Virgin Spring . When the Hollywood offer came , says Von Sydow , " I thought with horror of Cecil B. DeMille and such things as Samson and Delilah and The Ten Commandments . But when I saw the script , I decided that the role of Jesus is absolutely not a religious clich. "
