Two years ago , when Steve McQueen was just starting to make a name for himself in television , he got the kind of break which few young actors encounter outside their dreams : Director John Sturges offered him a supporting role in the motion picture Never So Few , starring Frank Sinatra . McQueen naturally accepted with alacrity  --  but not without misgivings . A lifetime spent in singlehanded combat against a largely hostile world had taught him to expect thorns in even the rosiest prospects , and he had rarely been surprised . This time he was  --  most of all , probably , by Sinatra himself . Frank has the reputation of sometimes being hard to get along with , but , says McQueen , " when we met , I sort of dug him and he dug me . We 're like minds ; we 're both like children emotionally . " What cemented his friendship for Sinatra was their common affinity for firecrackers . " Those so-and-so 's , " Steve says , grinning . " One day I was sitting reading my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind me and put a lighted firecracker in one of the loops ofmy gun belt , and the thing blew up and shot me about three feet in the air . So I went and got one of the Tommy guns we used in the picture and a full clip of blank cartridges . And Frank and Peter Lawford and the others were just walking away , and I called , ' Frank ! ' and they turned around and I went ' Wa-a-a-a ' ? the whole clip . " At close range the wads and flash from a blank cartridge can be both shocking and painful , and , says McQueen , " that whole set just went dead still for about ten seconds . " Then Sinatra laughed , and it was all right . From then on they spent much of the time between takes lobbing firecrackers at one another ? " We had about six hundred cherry bombs on the back lot at Metro , " Steve says  --  and eveybody had a ball . " I thought , ' Man , I 've found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live ! You know ? It was just organized chaos . " The key that opened the door to this exhilarating world for McQueen was his early work in the television series Wanted  --  Dead or Alive , now in its third season . Back in 1958 , when C.B.S . launched the show , John Sturges saw some of the first episodes and liked the way Steve handled himself as Josh Randall , the slight , blond , bullet-headed bounty hunter who is If'antcd 's unlikely hero . Bounty hunters  --  men who stalked fugitives from frontier justice for the reward money  --  were not generally held in high esteem : but McQueen has from the beginning succeeded in making Randall both believable and sympathetic , without resorting to either spurious sentiment or showy heroics . Whether the script concerns the hunt itself or the complications involved in escorting an unwilling prisoner to jail , he is simply a man trying to do a dangerous , unglamorous job with a minimum of fuss . That , at least , is the way McQueen comes across on the screen . Around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fuss is often considerable . " He 's an itchy guy , " says one of the show 's three directors . " Things have got to be done his way . " And McQueen 's personal manager , Hillard Elkins , who has known the actor for several years , adds , " He has a chip on his shoulder . He 's been pushed around so much in his life that it 's instinctive with him to push back  --  sometimes even when nobody 's pushed him yet . " Moreover , McQueen is unencumbered by a ' high regard for conventional behavior , a fact which has caused him to be described as a " Western beatnik . " He rides a battered motor scooter around the studio as if its only speeds were Full and Stop , frequently rearing it back and squirting it along on the rear wheel . His favorite mode of dress consists of sneakers and abbreviated shorts , often with the top buttonundone . His speech is a nearly inaudible highspeed mumble liberally salted with beatnik slang and barracks-room epithets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This last , as a matter of fact , is a habit he is trying to overcome ; and when it impels people to compare him with Marlon Brando , as it sometimes does , he is as much annoyed as flattered . " All this ratchin ' and scratchin ' jazz , " he says . " I do n't think Mr. Brando is really like that ; I think he uses it as an actor , which is great . But I come from a world of ratchin ' and scratchin ' , and I 'm trying to get away from it . I do n't want people staring at me in a room like I 'm some long lost bird from Ethiopia . " Like nearly all television actors , McQueen is haunted by the fear that his success is a bubble which may burst at any moment , particularly since Wanted has this season been moved from Saturday to Wednesday night , where it comes up against The Price Is Right , a notorious killer of competition . But McQueen 's position is actually a good deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he has also earned himself a solid place in the more prestigious world of motion pictures . Starting his career in Hollywood films with Never So Few , he so impressed John Sturges with his performance that when the director set about casting his new large-budget Western The Magnificent Seven a year ago , he wanted Steve as one of the picture 's seven badmenturned-benefactors . This was a distinct compliment to McQueen , because Sturges chose his actors less for their facility in certain types of part than for their ability to project strongly individual personalities . Steve had considerable freedom to develop his role as he liked , to improvise and experiment  --  and these are things dear to the heart of McQueen . His relationship with Yttl Brynner , on the other hand , was somewhat less cordial than with Sinatra in the previous picture . Steve says , " I think I represented a threat to him . He does n't ride very ( Continued on Page 58 ) 58 THE SATURDAY ENV . N LNG p 0 sT A world-famous research institute has discovered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heal hemorrhoids without surgery . It stops itching and relieves pain in minutes , then speeds up healing of the sore , injured tissues ali while actual reduction ( shrinking ) takes place . Tests conducted under a doctor 's observations proved this so , And most amazing of all , this very striking improvement was maintained over a period of many months . In fact , results were so thorough , sufferers were able to make such statements as " Piles have ceased to be a problem . " Arnimg these sufferers were a very wide variety of hemorrhoid conditions , some of 10 to 20 years ' standing . All this was accomplished without the use of narcotics , astringents or anesthetics of any kind , The secret is the remarkable new healing substance ( Bio-Dyne:9 which quickly helps heal injured cells and stimulates regrowth of healthy tissue again .

Any drug counter . well , and he does n't know anything about quick draws and that stuff . I know horses . 1 know guns . I was in my element , and he was n't . " At one point art item appeared in a Hollywood column that Brynner and McQueen were having a feud , and when Yul read it , he went straight to McQueen . " He came up behind me , " Steve says , " and grabbed me by the shoulder  --  you know : ' I want to talk to you . ' And I do n't dig that stuff . He said , ' There 's an item going around that we 're having a feud , see ? And I 'm an established star and you 're an up-and-coming star , and we 're not having a feud and 1 want you to send a letter to these people saying that it is n't true . ' And 1 said , ' Well , sure , I 'll see you Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punt . ' You know ? " They never became fast friends . John Sturges , seeing the friction between Brynner and McQueen from the outside , insists , " There was no feud , really . Naturally there were some clashes . They 're dissimilar characters : Yul is like a rock , Steve 's volatile . Steve figured Yul was being a Big Star , that he was n't willing for anyone else to catch flies " ? that is , draw the audience 's attention by some piece of stage business ? " and Yul thought Steve was being an undisciplined smart aleck , always trying to catch a fly . He got sore because Steve was always fiddling with his hat or something . I had to tell Steve not to busy it up all the time  --  do n't do something : just stand there . " Whatever the causes of the friction , Sturges is confident that none of it shows in the picture 's final cut version . Released this past fall , the film promises to give McQueen 's career a powerful boost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he can ever get sprung from TV , is going to be a great big star . In his last two films he has played secondary leads , and in each he has held his own against the top star , to put it politely . " Steve makes no secret of the fact that getting sprung from TV is just what he 'd like . He has already received several tempting offers to make more features , but he is committed to Wanted for two more years after the present season ; and meanwhile he is trying to follow a piece of advice from John Sturges . After Never So Few , Steve obviously began to chafe under his bondage to Four Star , and Sturges told him then either to do the series as well as he knew how or not to do it at all  --  try to get released from his contract or take up some other line of work . After some strenuous soul searching , Steve decided to stay with Wanted and , following through , he has since devoted himself to improving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly tricky operation In the process he has come to feel a personal responsibility for the show rather broader than that assumed by most stars , and his resultant willingness to dispute the judgment of his writers , directors and producer has not always endeared him to those gentlemen . This troubles him remarkably little . " I 'm not out to win a popularity contest , " he says . " I 'm out to get a job done . I do n't care whether Four Star burns down , but as long as I 'm with the show , 1 will do the best I know how . " McQueen has a quick , inventive mind , and the very force of his enthusiasms takes some of the sting out of his meddling . " Everybody is catching this enthusiasm , " he says , " and that 's what I want . I 'll take three sheets and rip ' em out of the script , and we 'll rewrite ' ern ( Continued from Page 27 ) right there on location . The cameraman will say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do n't we drop the camera down here ? ' ' Yeah , yeah , that 's good . ' Or someone will say , ' Steve , let 's change these lines . ' We 're all working  --  because these are men creating , from the key grip on down . And you do n't see much of that spirit around on most shows . " Recently Steve has been trying to be a little more tactful about obtruding his opinions , but it 's an uphill fight . " One mistake I have made , " he admits , " is sometimes I forget about the dignity of my directors . Sometimes I get enthused about a scene and I go to an actor and say , ' Hey , look , play it this way , man , ' And then I 'll look over at the director and he 's got a funny look on his face , and 1 ' 11 go over and say I 'm sorry . I mean , I would n't like it done to me . " The toes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who writes half the scripts in addition to producing the show ; and some of Adamson 's sessions with an excitedly adamant McQueen are conducted at a rather intense pitch . As Adamson concedes , however , " Nobody would know more about Josh Randall than Steve would . He knows what Randall would do and what he would n't do Steve is n't argumentative arbitrarily . That does n't mean I like it any better , but I do have respect for him . And when I look at the finished product , I love him , Many times I think he 's wonderful  --  and that 's hard for me to say some days . " Over the years McQueen has put more and more of himself into the character of Josh Randall . " It 's not completely me , " he says . " but there is a great deal of me there . I try to think what Randall would do in a situation , and then I also try to put in some of my own ingredients  --  what I would do . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would live very long if he did n't have a lively respect for the odds . When they 're against Randall , he backs away . As McQueen says , " If three guys come down the street and say , ' Look , Josh , get out of town , ' he 'll say , Right . O.K. ' And then he 'll wait and get them one at a time . He does n't want to get his head handed to him for nothing . " In addition , as McQueen sees it , Randall must be a man who likes being constantly on the move , and who prefers living alone , responsible to no one but himself . Moreover , to have chosen bounty hunting as his vocation at all , he 'd have to enjoy danger . " He 's a little thrill-happy , " says McQueen . " He likes a little excitement . " Point for point , these traits also characterize Steve McQueen . " I 'm not going to fight with a guy who 's eight feet tall , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or John Dillinger . I 'd say , ' Well , look , Sim , let 's talk this over . ' But if somebody pushes me so far that 1 do n't have anywhere to go , I 'm going to fight with him , and I 'm going to get him any way I can . If I rip his ear off or put his eye out , that 's the ball game . I do n't play around . I want to win . I remember once in the marines there were two guys who always stuck together . One guy kept provoking me , and one day we had a real argument , but his friend was standing there , and I bowed out . But I got him alone the next day ; I waited for him in the toilet , and I said , ' Hey , you , ' and he turned around , and I punched him and 1 kicked hell out of him . And the other guy never bothered me . I made my point . " Again like Randall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , man , " . laundry ; inn he says . " I mean l dug being alone . " And he has always had an itchy foot , u restless drive which , until he settled upon acting as a career . sent him prowling around the country most of his life , working at one odd job after another . Even now he occasionally gels a sudden urge to sample other climes . According to his wife , actress Neile Adams , " He 'll wake up at two in the morning and say , ' Let 's go to Florida . ' and well take off . He 's terribly impulsive . " Finally , like Randall , McQueen is thrill-happy , When he lived in New York , before coming to California , he owned a motorcycle which he dearly loved ? " It was a beautiful bike . " he says . " It was real trim and swift and handled very well ; you could lay it all the way down " ? and he used to get into drag races with it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed himself racing on New York 's West Side Highway . " 1 was dragging a guy , " he says , " and I was honestly doing a hundred miles an hour , and 1 came down the exit ramp doing a hundred , and 1 looked back to see where he was . And when I looked around again , all of a sudden the traffic had cone to a dead stop at the bottom of the ramp . " I think well in a situation like that . never get rattled . I got as far back on the bike as I could  --  the weight 's the important thing  --  and I hit both brakes . I remember there was a bunch of kids sitting in the back seat of the car ahead of me , looking back ; and I just skidded up and barely tapped the back bumper . It was that close . " In 1958 , after moving to Hollywood , he abandoned motorcycle racing in favor of automobile racing . " It 's a beautiful sport . " he says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get in my car , I used to get scared . I remember my first time out , I said to myself , ' What the hell am I doing here ? ' I was out there skidding in between cars and going into the turns as deep as I could before I hit the brakes and dicing for position and everything  --  you know , really on the ragged edge all the time . And I finally thought to myself , ' Man , you can get killed doing this ! ' But I like the idea of having to overcome the fright , you know ? It 's quite a feeling , a real pure feeling . " McQueen did well in competition , for a beginner . He took part in six races , all told , driving either the Porsche he owned first or the Lotus Le Mans he bought later ; and only twice did he finish worse than third in class . Early Last year , however , he was persuaded to give up the sport . For one thing , Four Star did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and insisted on a no-racing clause in his contract . For another , as Steve says , " All the elements seemed to be against it . I 'm married , I 've got a kid that I love very much " ? and , as this is written , a second child is due momently ? " I 've got a house ; I 'm very happy here . Everything 's going O.K. I do n't want to kill myself right now , " He still drives his Jaguar in a manner that makes his passengers fear for their own lives , however ; and his love of speed has more than once brought him the unfriendly attention of the California police . Early in 1959 , in fact , it nearly took him out from behind the wheel for good . He and Neile were driving to Phoenix for some location shooting . " And at this point , " he says . " I 'd lost my license twice , and if I got another ticket , it would be all over : I 'd be driving Pogo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a nice flat road  --  safe , no humps  --  and I was going a hundred miles an hour in the Porsche , and all of a sudden this cop came up in back of us out of nowhere . And I asked Neile , ' Are we still in California ? ' and she said , ' Yeah , ' and I said , ' Well , it 's all over , baby . " ' At the time , Neile was six months pregnant with their daughter , Terry Leslie , born June b , 1959. and Steve got an inspiration . " I stopped the car , " he says , " and I jumped out and ran up to the cop and said . ' You 've got to get me to the hospital . My wife 's going to have a baby . ' And he said , ' O.K. , follow me , ' and he took off and we followed him into town , " Neile was rushed into the hospital , and a nurse began examining her . " And I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby : Steve says . " That 's what really scared me . And as soon as the cop walked out the door , I said to the nurse , ' Forget it , forget it ; she 's cool ; do n't worry about it . ' and got her out . " McQueen 's predilection for fast driving , his easily detonated temper and his ingrained resentment of authority in all guises have often earned him the reputation of being one of the " angry young men " of show business , but Steve snorts rejection of that description . " I 'm not angry , " he says , " I 'm happy . I come from a world where people will step all over you and kick your teeth out . And if you get out of that , you 're not angry . What do I have to be bugged about ? " Life began dealing Terrence Stephen McQueen bad breaks from the start . His parents were divorced soon after his birth in Indianapolis , Indiana , on March 24 , 1930 ; and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her uncle on a farm in Slater , Missouri . When Steve was six , his mother remarried , and they moved to California . From that time on he felt that he never got much love or attention from her or from his stepfather , whom he disliked . " When I was fourteen , " he says , " I had a real bad scene with them . I was looking for a little love , and there was n't much around . I guess I was difficult . I ran around with a bad crowd , and I hated school  --  the regimentation and everything . " Steve 's parents sent him to the California Junior Republic , a privately run home for wayward boys in Chino . Steve was miserable there . " I wens to school in the 59 morning , " he says , " and in the afternoon I worked in the laundry , and I did n't make that scene at all . So after about three months I got bugged and took off . " He was caught by the police before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the staff , instead of paddling him , put his arm around the boy 's shoulders and talked some sense into him . From then on he managed to stay out of trouble until his mother sent for him about a year later . In the meantime he finished ninth grade , his last formal education . His mother had moved to New York after her second husband died , and Steve joined her there , but it was too late for them to build any real mother-son relationship ; and when Steve was fifteen he ran away and shipped out on a tanker as an ordinary seaman . The tanker went to the West Indio-s for a cargo of molasses ; and by the time it got back to Port Arthur , Texas , Steve had discovered that he disliked regimentation at sea as much as he did on land . He jumped ship . During the next year he worked variously as a waiter in a Port Arthur brothel , a laborer in the Texas oil fields and a tree topper for a Canadian lumber company . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Marine Corps . Regimentation in the marines was , of course , the strictest he had yet encountered ; but , although he spent forty-one days in the brig after letting a weekend pass drag on into two weeks and then fighting with the Shore Patrol when he was picked up , his keenest memories of his three years in uniform concern food . McQueen loves to eat  --  a typical meal today might consist of " some meat , two orders of mashed potatoes and gravy , some candied sweet potatoes , a double-thick milk shake , hot tea and lots of bread and butter and jelly , " according to his manager , Hillard Elkins  --  and , on the whole , Steve liked the marine chow fine . At one point , however , his outfit moved out for cold-weather amphibious exercises in Labrador , and for a while the food situation became desperate for McQueen . " They were starving me to death on those funky rations , " he says , using a favorite adjective , which translates roughly as the city slicker 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know McQueen 's reputation as a glutton told him to help unload a landing craft full of food for the officers ' mess . Steve was an Amtrac driver , and , he says , " 1 jumped in that mother " ? which is McQueen talk for - thing " ? " and 1 drove down to the boat and heisted as much food as I thought I could get away with and hid it in the Amtrac . They were cans of beans , which was great with me  --  man , I love beans  --  but they were ice cold , and I was in no mood for anything cold at this point . " He and his crew chief decided the thing to do was to rev up the Amtrac 's engine while Steve held a can of beans over the exhaust for a while . " This went on for about three or four minutes . " Steve says , " but I 'd forgotten to open the can , and suddenly there was this tremendous explosion . It knocked me back about three feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , jeeps , radar equipmentrwerything ! And for about the next week I 'd go by art officer and salute him , you know , and he 'd have a bean stuck on his helmet . " In April of 1950 McQueen 's hitch was up , and he was discharged at Camp Lejeune , North Carolina . He spent the next few weeks  --  and most of his accumulated pay  --  in Myrtle Beach , South Carolina . " I 'd been going with a girl there , " lie says , " so I stayed at the Beach and ran around with her crowd , eighteen , nineteen years old  --  college kids , you know . And l thought this was wonderful , going over to people 's houses for dinner and getting dressed up , going to dances , and everybody liked you , and you were saying ' hello ' to people . I mean , I never had this before , " It was during his stay in Myrtle Beach , incidentally , that Steve picked up the pouty-lipped Southern accent he uses as Josh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he found himself as much adrift in the world as ever before . Making his way to New York , he rented a cold-water flat in Greenwich Village for nineteen dollars a month . Steve took to life in the Village like a squirrel to a new nut tree . " For the first time in my life , " he says , " I was really exposed to music , culture , a little kindness , a little sensitivity . It was a way of life where people talked out their problems instead of punching you . " For the next year and a half he made rent and food money any way he could . At different times he worked as delivery-man for a radio-repair shop , as a truck driver 's helper and , during a winter foray into Florida , as beachboy at one of the plush Miami hotels . He made artificial flowers in the " smelly little dark cellar " of a shop on Third Avenue ? " I could n't make that scene at all. - He sold encyclopedia sets door-to-door ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talking them into encyclopedias . " And he hawked cheap pen-andpencil sets with a traveling carnival . At one point , with no job at all , he wandered into a Village drugstore and idly picked up a shower nozzle . He was standing holding it when a clerk came up and asked if he had brought it to return . He said yes and , as he recalls , received $5.30 for it . " And I ate for two days on that , " he says . " It happened by mistake , but I used the idea after that . " It was a haphazard kind of existence , but at least it kept him alive , and that was as much as McQueen had learned to expect of life . Then , in the fall of 1951 , a girl he knew suggested he try acting and sent him to see Sanford Meisner , director of the Neighborhood Playhouse . then and now one of New York 's better acting schools . Something about the rebellious youngster impressed Meisner . " He was an original personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was both tough and childlike , as if he 'd been through everything , but still preserved a certain innocence . " Meisner accepted him at the Playhouse , and McQueen studied there for two years with the help of his GI Bill and a scholarship . The summer of 1952 , between his first and second years at the Playhouse , Steve made his professional debut . It was in a summer-stock production of the play Peg a ' Aly Heart , with Margaret O'Brien , and he says , " I remember one of the other actors coming to me after the performance and saying , ' Steve , 1 want you to know that your performance was just embarrassing : - He acquitted himself somewhat better in subsequent summer appearances ; but for the next four years Steve 's career as an actor limped along at a rather discouraging pace , with occasional small parts in various live television dramas  --  in which he generally played juvenile delinquents  --  separated by long periods of inactivity . Little by little , however , he was starting to gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention in New York theatrical circles . In 1956 when Ben Gazzara left the Broadway company of A Ilatjid of Rain , Steve was invited to read for his part . He won it , and stayed with the show for three months , until it closed on October thirteenth . The new-found prestige of being a Broadway actor emboldened him to make overtures to an attractive young actress named Neile Adams , who was working in the musical comedy The Pajama Game at the time , and whom he had been admiring from afar for some weeks . Contriving an introduction , he asked her for a date and took her riding on the back of his motorcycle . The approach seems to have been effective  --  they saw each other nearly every night after that . " I 'd never been exposed to that type of man , " Neile says . " I 'd been brought up in convents , and suddenly this wild man was in my life . " Steve says , " I showed her a way of life she never knew  --  the Village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make-up and going on long rides on the bike up in the hills . Man , it was real romantic . " After their respective plays closed , at about the same time , Neile went to California to make a movie , and that fall Steve followed her and persuaded her that they ought to get married . They rented a car and drove down to San Juan Capistrano , intending to get married at the mission there , since both Steve and Neile are Roman Catholic . But when Steve called the mission , one of the nuns told him that , not being from the parish , they could n't be married there , " And I got in a big argument with her , " McQueen says , " and I finally said , ' The hell with it . We 'll go and live in sin for the rest of our lives . ' " They got back in the car and Steve , fuming , drove off with even greater dash than usual , with the result that the would-be bride and groom presently found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steve said , " we just want to get married , " and the troopers , relenting , found them a Lutheran minister who agreed to open his church and perform the ceremony . " We did n't have any witnesses , " Steve says , " so this was really uncanny  --  getting married with two state troopers for witnesses standing there behind us with their big pistols and everything . " During much of the next year their work kept them apart  --  Neile in Las Vegas , where she .. had a singing engagement , and Steve in New York , the only place where he was known as an actor and could find work . He made a few television shows and had small parts in three low-budget movies which he prefers to forget : The Blob , Never Love a Stranger and The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery . But that fall he and Neile got back together again . Vincent Fennelly , producer of the Trackdown television series , was looking for a man to play a bounty hunter in one of the episodes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use it as a pilot film for a new series , with the bounty hunter as hero . Steve 's agent persuaded Fennelly to test McQueen for the part , and although Steve was n't particularly interested in doing a series , he read the script and became fascinated with the character of Josh Randall . " It was n't really developed much , " he says . " The inner stuff was n't showing yet . " But he liked the possibilities he saw in the , role . Steve made a screen test and got the part . " 1 picked him because he was a little guy , " says Fennelly . " You know , a bounty hunter is sort of the underdog  --  everyone 's against him except the audience . And McQueen was an offbeat guy ; he was n't the best-looking guy in the world , and he had a kind of animal instinct  --  he could be nice , but with some menace underneath . " Since then , Steve 's upward progress has not been checked . The pilot was sold to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Kimberly-Clark ( Kleenex ) pick up the tab ; and Wanted  --  Dead or Alive , as Fennelly called his new show , quickly forged into the // front ranks of the veritable posse of Westerns on the air , last season averaging a handsome Nielsen rating of 28.7 . Steve relishes success , both for what it means to his career and , perhaps more important , for the rewards it brings . Not the least of these is the chance to take life a bit easier . " What 's the point of being successful if you ca n't goof off a little ? " he asks . " A guy bucks for sergeant so he can goof off , not because he 's so gung ho about being a sergeant . And so now I am taking a little advantage of my position . I can leave a little earlier at night from my series . I can come in a little later in the morning . I get a nicer dressing room , I get a little more respect from the producer than I did before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also made Steve realize that he can no longer live only for himself . " It 's one thing to be irresponsible and be dangerous and hack around , " he says , " to start racing and stick your neck out , face death and all kinds of tricky situations . But it 's another to be a father and husband and a provider . So I say to myself , ' Well , let 's grow up a little , Steveo-reno : " For the first time in his life he feels that he is in a position to make some reasonably solid plans for the future . He is earning about $100,000 a year from the series , his motion-picture price has gone to $75,000 in two fast jumps and , he says , " Every bit of money I make I am investing in things that will make it secure for my wife and my family . " He has recently bought an interest in a Christmas-stocking factory , and has plans for a combined sports-car garage and health-food bar . More important , he has formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started accumulating motion-picture and television scripts for future use . He also feels a new sense of responsibility to his profession . " l 'm trying to use what power I 've been given by my luck and God and what talent I 've got , to achieve the things that are good for television , " he says . " I love my craft . I swing with what I 'm doing , and I 'm still learning . Any actor that works on a television show and just takes home the money every week is crazy . 1 mean , this is a great opportunity to learn your craft .
