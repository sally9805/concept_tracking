The life-or-death question of how the U.S. would come out in a thermonuclear confrontation with the Soviet Union has a nagging habit of cropping up shortly before Election Day . In 1960 , the Democrats ' misleading charges of a " missile gap " served to confuse and alarm voters . This year it was Richard Nixon who sought a last-minute advantage . " The present state of our defenses is too close to peril point , " Nixon charged in a radio speech , " and our future prospects are in some respects downright alarming . We have a gravely serious security gap . " <P> The statistics that Nixon used , matched against figures marshaled by the Administration to rebut him , added to the mystification of the layman . But close examination suggests that Nixon was being less than responsible in playing a nuclear numbers game . <P> MISSILES . Discussing the U.S. arsenal of land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles , Nixon declared that Dwight Eisenhower left office in 1961 bequeathing to the U.S. a 50% advantage over the Soviet Union . Today , Nixon maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only marginal-and diminishing daily . <P> True . But not quite that simple . In 1961 , the U.S. owned precisely ten ICBMS , and the Russians had only 50% of this-just five missiles . In 1968 , Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford has noted , the U.S. has a total of 1,054 land-based missiles , while the Russians have installed 900 . <P> BOMBERS . Nixon charged that the Administration has " so positioned our country that by 1970 or 1971 we could find ourselves with a ' survival gap ' - discovering then that we are irretrievably behind in the most critical areas . " Nixon continued : " Eight years ago , our numerical advantage over the Soviets in bombers was 30% . Now it 's more than the other way around . Today the Soviets are 50% ahead of us . " At the end of 1960 , when both superpowers still relied principally upon bombers as a means of delivering nuclear warheads , the U.S. had 1,930 big intercontinental bombers , the Russians only 1,200 . Today , with bombers serving primarily as a back-up force to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 646 planes . <P> The Russians have approximately 150 heavy Bear bombers that can reach the U.S. and get home again without refueling . Nixon 's figure can only be attained by including the Soviet force of some 700 relatively slow , medium-range aircraft that could fly only one-way missions without air-to-air refueling . <P> SUBMARINES . When the Democrats assumed power , the U.S. had 14 nuclear subs , the Russians none . Today the U.S. fleet has 76 atom-fueled submarines and the Soviet Union 55 . <P> Nixon neglected to mention the overwhelming superiority that the U.S. now enjoys in submarine-launched missiles . <P> American submarines can launch 656 missiles , while Soviet undersea craft have fewer than 80 missiles in their nu clear magazines . <P> Nixon also left one important and familiar question begging : When the stockpiles of both powers already ensure a massive overkill , why should the U.S. add to its thermonuclear hoard in or der to convince any potential enemy that all-out warfare would signify immediate devastation ? Nixon 's view is that keeping ahead of the Soviets in a nuclear race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned soft .
