txt Letters to The Times Mayor 's Record Assessed Credit Given Wagner for Executive Decisions Questioned The writer of the following , former president of The City Club , was a member of the State Commission on Governmental Operations of the City of New York . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your Nov. 28 editorial " The Mayor Weighs His Future " went directly to the vital point . Any candidacy for Vice President must be assessed on the basis of capacity to serve as President . While you . correctly state that " in his ten years in office the Mayor can boast of some solid achievements , " the manner and form of Mayor Wagner 's achievements must he analyzed . I shall refer only to those matters mentioned favorably in your editorial , of which the first is the establishment of the office of City Administrator . This essential office has never been given the staff and delegated powers to do the work for which it was proposed . It has been the recipient of scores of directives from the Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still to do the job for which it was designed by Luther Gulick , You then credit the Mayor with helping to put through a new City Charter , but the Mayor went along only after the Governor 's initiative had resulted in the preparation by a state commission of a new charter . You credit the Mayor as " the prime mover in the long-overdue rezoning of the city . " As one who plotted and schemed with civic representatives and city officials on how to change Wagner from an obstacle into a mover , I must say that you have probably forgotten your own despair at getting the Mayor to act . No Funds for Planners While the Mayor 's appointments to the City Planning Commission have been good , there has been cause for the City Club , the Citizens Union and others , including The Times , to complain that the commission has never been able to perform its functions fully because the Mayor has never seen fit to provide it with the needed funds , While the Mayor has improved the lot of city employes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups from time to time on their voting strength and belligerence . He has set no pattern of equity in this area . Rather , he has established a wage increase formula of first rejecting salary requests , then condoning employe conflict and coercion , and finally conceding in many cases larger increases than ! those initially demanded . One must have tongue in cheek to credit the Mayor for overhauling the Board of Education . Has The Times forgotten the scandals which led to the state legislation that replaced the old board with a new ? Max Rubin and his associates were appointed to the Board of Education only after the selection of qualified candidates was taken out of the Mayor 's hands . As for other credits you give the Mayor , none of them showed either initiative or celerity of action . There can be no gainsaying the fact that Mayor Wagner 's record as an executive is poor . We dare not risk the nation 's fate on his ability to act rapidly and decisively in the first office of the land . , SEYMOUR GRAUB ARD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Sorrow To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Millions of us , under the heavy sorrow of these recent days , have fallen in love with our country all over again . In youth our affection was sentimental . We acknowledged acclaim for the semi-legendary heroes of our land 's tradition ; we respected the flag ; we pledged our allegiance and sang patriotic songs ; we exulted in the ritual of commitment . But such affection could not stand disillusionment so mighty as the denial of Wilsonian ideals , nor the inexplicable misery of depression years , nor the isolationism that helped to elevate a Hitler . We even made the sacrifices of the Second World War with understandable reluctance . Our cynicism has not been eased by the slow pace of civil rights , the reduction in foreign aid , the continued problem of the unemployed , and the stubbornness of widespread crime and the compromise of morals . In the sudden death of John Fitzgerald Kennedy and the aftermath of sadness , the nation has exposed its heart , its soul , its spirit ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this more mature affection may provide the stimulus we need to heal the breach between the races ; to enlarge the domain of freedom in foreign lands ; to build our economy where each man can know himself to be a needed hand in the pursuing of our common good ; to flush the thieves out of hiding ; and to return us to actions informed by principles of integrity , fair play , and mutual self-respect . We know these virtues to be latent in a land capable of showing what America has shown under a shock that will not let us be complacent . MYRON K. SIBLEY , Professor of Philosophy , Alfred University . Alfred , N. Y. , Nov. 26 , 1963 . Investing in Latin America , U. S. Business Advised to Welcome Domestic Capital , Personnel To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIm ES : In his letter published Nov. 21 Prof. Raymond Vernon points out the need for United States investors in Latin America to be prepared for changing conditions . The unpleasant fact we must face is that hostility and distrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin America than in almost any other part of the world . The recent actions of the Governments of Pen ; and Argentina are symptomatic of this attitude . The specific question to be answered is , " What must United States investors do to adapt to changing conditions and overcome existing obstacles ? " For one thing , United States firms have failed badly in their public relations job . Much more must he done through all available media to inform the local people how these firms are benefiting their host countries : Capital brought in , profits invested in expansion , local taxes paid , health , education and training of local people , good pay and working conditions , et cetera . As Professor Vernon points out . a new class of technicians , administrators and businessmen anxious to prove their mettle is growing up in Latin America . It is important that these people be given the opportunity to occupy executive positions right up to the top on a basis of equality with United States personnel . It makes a big difference whether the interests of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , ipso facto , is suspect , or by a local citizen who is trusted . For Zoned Subway Fares TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In view of the threatening subway crisis I would like to suggest the idea of zoning subway fares . What I have in mind is the payment of a nominal fare if one travels within a borough , with an additional fare for each additional one . The idea of charging one flat rate for the local rider is a little hard tO swallow inasmuch as the fare , I believe , is aimed at the two- or threeborough rider . Let each rider pay his own distance in fares . Could n't a rider buy a token of correct size and weight to be used only in the zone from which he will exit the subway ? In other words , the rider will buy a token for exiting and not for entering the subway . LOUIS S. ZACCAGNINO . Kew Gardens , L. I. , Nov. 29 , 1963 . Partnership Association There is an increasingly vociferous demand by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies . Therefore , among steps to be taken by United States investors to adapt to changing conditions the most important is , no doubt , the need to associate with local interests and capital on a partnership basis . United States firms in Latin America are constantly and as a rule unfairly being accused of bleeding the host country by making exorbitant profits and taking them out of the country . Taking in local capita , would radically change the status of the firm , since it will he the local rather than the United States investors who would be defending the company 's profit and general business policies . True , having local partners brings new problems , but the disadvantages are by far outweighed by the advantages , especially if the majority interest is retained by the foreign firm . Many United States firms , and among them some of the most important , refuse to accept local capital . Thus in their unwillingness to adapt to changing conditions they are bucking an inexorable trend . Unless they see the handwriting on the wall , their existence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
