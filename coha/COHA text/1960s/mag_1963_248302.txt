The white-trimmed brick building at Beltsville , Md. , is swarming with frustrated maidens and looks like a young ladies ' finishing school . But there are no students among the 8,000 carefully segregated females who live there . They all work for the U.S. Department of Agriculture , and they spend their lives in milk cans warmed by a gentle stream of air . Raised and cared for by Entomologist Robert T. Yamamoto , these sex-starved cockroaches are fed on dog meal , and their only job is to exude a sex lure that drives male cockroaches crazy . <P> Entomologists have long known that female cockroaches use perfume to advertise their nubility . Army chemists at Natick , Mass. , once extracted a powerfully attractive substance from filter paper crawled over by virgin females , but it was mixed up with too many other materials to be analyzed successfully . The Beltsville system is better ; the air passing through the cans carries the cockroach perfume to a flask cooled by Dry Ice . There the vapor condenses and is periodically collected . After an elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( .0004 oz. ) of pure attractant , equivalent to the perfume produced by 10,000 virgin females advertising themselves over a nine-month period . <P> Active Oil . The yellow liquid has only a faintly oily smell to human nostrils , but what it does to male cockroaches is a sight to behold . Only a bit more than one-third of a thousandth of a billionth of a billionth of an ounce wafted into their cage starts them running around madly , vibrating their wings and trying to mate with each other . <P> After Dr. Yamamoto collected a working amount of sex lure , his colleagues . Chemists Martin Jacobson and Morton Beroza , determined its chemical structure . This called for long and delicate procedures . At last , the chemists decided that the active attractant is **41;3318;TOOLONG propionate . In spite of its formidable name , it is not very complicated for an organic compound , so Jacobson and Beroza are sure that it can be synthesized in quantity without much trouble . <P> <P> Sneaky Scheme . When this is done , it may mean the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the species bred by Dr. Yamamoto . The males can not resist its attraction , so they can be lured easily into baited traps . But this simple scheme does not satisfy the anti-cockroach forces . The females will not be affected , they point out , and a few males attracted to them in the age-old way will work overtime to make them lay fertile eggs . <P> Much better , say the Beltsville entomologists , is the sneakier scheme of using synthetic sex lure to trick the males into crawling over a chemical that will sterilize them but do them no harm in any other way . They will mate normally with normal females whenever they get the opportunity .
