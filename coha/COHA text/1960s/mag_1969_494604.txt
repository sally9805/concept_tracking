Critics now are almost poets , planetary poets making notes toward their supreme fictions . The critic is happy to comment upon literature , but only on the understanding that the interest of the commentary is intrinsic , " self-creating , " " self-delighting . " Few critics are content to say helpful things about hard poems . - Denis Donoghue ( New York Review , 3/9/67 ) In the sixties criticism aspired to become autobiography . The decade 's notorious success , Susan Sontag , describes her first volume as " not criticism at all , strictly speaking , but case studies for an aesthetic , a theory of my own sensibility . " And her sensibility , relatively immune to the blandishments of literature , seems typical . The distinguished magazine in which Donoghue writes moves away from novels and poems , ignoring or omnibusing them in order to express more outrage at Vietnam or the New York School strike . Partisan Review , which made its reputation popularizing the masterworks of modernism , follows Sontag 's " new sensibility " by selling the ephemera of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while poetry , known to be unread , and fiction , long since deceased , get scant attention . There are exceptions . Still , no one could call this an " age of criticism , " as Randall Jarrell called the forties and fifties , or fear that criticism is displacing literature . Today literature is displaced by politics , while criticism , quavering before its imminent collapse , becomes a lyric mode . Jarrell was also lyrical , but he always sang the praise of something outside himself : good poems . Philip Rahv , another fine old critic with a new book , resisted solipsism by believing that " criticism . . . is a medium first and foremost of the critic 's ' response to literature and almost indirectly , by refraction as it were , of his response to life . " Long ago , T. S. Eliot defined criticism as the " elucidation of texts and correction of taste . " By emphasizing the first and neglecting the second activity , the same wave of " new criticism " that raised literary discussion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it mostly languishes , run into sands of sterile analysis , anatomizing anything - even empty shells . But men like Jarrell and Rahv saw this threat before it became the dangerous fashion . To save criticism from aridity , one proposed revitalization by feeling , the other amplification through a " sixth sense " ( historical imagination ) . To a notable degree , each man succeeded , but neither without cost . In Rahv , the cost is remoteness or obsolescence . His sense of history is sometimes so extraordinary an alertness to contemporary problems that when they lose their urgency , so does Rahv . The new book ( including all of two previous volumes except the essays on Dostoyevsky ) reprints too many attacks on departed enemies . Pieces like " Proletarian Literature : A Political Autopsy " retain pertinence because the thirties ' Marxism that preferred Mike Gold to Henry James reappears in the new-left partisanship that caused certain critics to salivate merely at the title of Mailer 's Why Are We in Vietnam ? Other essays , however , like " Religion and the Intellectuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Intellectuals in the Postwar Situation " deal overzealously with false alarms . Sometimes , through entanglement in critical controversy , Rahv even becomes diverted from criticism . Thus , in a review of The Old Man and the Sea , he can barely attend to Hemingway 's prose , in anger at the foolish symbolic readings it engendered , and so fails adequately to deplore it . Famous essays , notably " Paleface and Redskin " ( 1939 ) , purport to be observation but are acceptable only as polemics . Dividing all American writers into opposing camps of naturalness and refinement , Rahv loses credibility not through sketchiness alone ( the piece is five pages long ) . Is it correct to place Melville among the refined Palefaces when his books are so critical of their ideology , however much he may have lived out their deprivations ? And should Rahv assign our century to the Redskins when its major writers include Eliot , Stevens , and Faulkner ? Only if you understand that he was trying to urge novelists of the forties to resist unanalyzed experience can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , the sixth sense that betrays Rahv into wasted involvement with contemporary issues also enables him to place the texts and writers he does discuss in illuminating perspective . Therefore , he can do justice to the problematic Henry Miller by accurately contrasting him with rebel artists he resembles only superficially . Or he can make an equally convincing case for Arthur Koestler by holding him up as an example of " homeless radicalism . " More importantly , the very sweep of Rahv 's historical understanding lends him some of that " ideal aloofness from abstract systems " in which he believes criticism must operate . Progressive that he is , he still knows enough history to appreciate the force of Kafka 's mythic emphasis on original sin , and though this belief appalls him , he is able to produce the first laudatory essay in English on Kafka 's dark world . Faulting Virginia Woolf 's unintended neglect of Mrs. Brown ( Woolf 's symbol for ineluctable reality ) , Rahv at the same time can argue ( in " Notes on the Decline of Naturalism " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When his concern with critical folly isolates a really major error , he makes his most important contribution . In " Fiction and the Criticism of Fiction " he squares off against the ponderous monism that would exalt Jane Austen over Tolstoy because the latter was less adroit with words . Properly insisting that language is less crucially the medium of novels than of poems ( about which he has virtually nothing to say ) , Rahv restores a sensible emphasis on fictional content : character , milieu , event , idea . Because he believes that novels provide insight , he takes them seriously , though he never judges them simply by what they say . Altogether he is an honorable proponent of the view that fiction is cognitive and , as such , an item in the creation of culture . But in his emphasis on the latter process he prefers the big picture to the little detail , so that readers seeking helpful comments on hard texts come away dissatisfied . Jarrell more often gives his attention to texts . But close analysis is not his forte , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burial/ " a near-parody of the new critical belief that one makes a known poem interesting by making it seem complex . When dealing with an unknown work , like Christina Stead 's The Man Who Loved Children , Jarrell falls into another error : hard-sell . Thus his opening assertion is perfervid ( " if all mankind had been reared in orphan asylums for a thousand years it could learn to have families again by reading this novel " ) and even misleading , since acquaintante with the awful Pails would sooner encourage celibacy . Identifying us with such eccentrics is as dubious a project as repeated attempts to coerce agreement by replacing the " I 's " in his opinions with " we 's . " Bleeding quotations hacked from the text , flattering allusions to Tolstoy and Proust are both signs of a failure to persuade ; and one is not surprised to see Jarrell eventually throw up his hands : " Does n't one feel the same satisfaction with , the same wonder at , some of the passages I have already quoted ? " Nevertheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps to encourage Stead , after long silence , to produce or find a publisher for other work . Despite his offenses against measure and tact , Jarrell did achieve the highest goal of criticism : he got someone to read a good book . When you have finished one of the good books that Jarrell loves you will usually find that he has fixed its goodness in a brilliant phrase . For this reason , his essay on Stevens is valuable despite its cavalier treatment of individual poems . Jarrell does n't follow the solemn fashion of taking all of Stevens ' pronunciamentos as profundities ; judiciously , he avers , " Few poets have ever made a more interesting rhetoric of just fooling around . " He recognizes the low-keyed sensibility which Stevens turned into a commanding voice : " it is as if Stevens did n't want the poetic equivalent of sonata form , and had gone back to earlier polyphonic ways , days when the crescendo was still uninvented . " And in one phrase he captures the surprise you feel on coming upon this ample poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an animal he would be , without a doubt , that rational , magnanimous , voluminous animal , the elephant . " If such insights are n't quite criticism , they are sparks that get the critical machine fired up . In essays on Graves and Auden , Jarrell not only fires up but moves ; in Auden 's case , like a juggernaut . Beginning with a witty epigram ( " We never step twice into the same Auden ? HERACLITUS " ) , Jarrell goes on to powerful indictments against Auden 's rhetorical excesses , evasive religiosity , and lack of moral proportion ( " Auden is interested in establishing a dichotomy in which one side , naturally , gets all the worst of it , and he wants all the worst to be as complete as possible , to NOVEMBER 29 , 1969 cover everything from imperialism to underlining too many words in let-ters " ) . Such phrases can be as illuminating as Rahv 's generalizations , but almost more than Rahv , Jarrell requires a highly educated reader . For only when one has already read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of insight or justice contained in his phrases because , like Rahv , he is frequently too magisterial to cite sufficient evidence . As a result , we get little help from him with hard poems , though if we have already understood them , Jarrell will tell us pointedly what they are worth . Rahv 's big pictures and Jarrell 's little phrases are each more stimulating than most critical exegesis , against which both stand in fundamental reaction . But one senses in each ( though more in Rahv than in Jarrell ) a certain impatience with criticism that may , after all , have paved the way for Donoghue 's heroes . We can never go back to " new criticism " ? with bloodless scientism and cultural obscurity ? but we must not move forward without the text . In Rahv 's hands , historicist criticism is often successful , but lesser men can turn intellectual analysis back into bias , just as epigones of Randall Jarrell may reduce enthusiasm to the mere assertion of personality . Should that happen , we will be surrounded only by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and we know what they 're full of .
