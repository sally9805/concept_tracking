" My diocese is said to be on the boil , " says the Rt . Rev. Mervyn Stockwood , Bishop of Southwark . " If that is so , I accept it as a compliment . Boiling water is better than tepid . It can cleanse and generate power . " Measured against British coolness to the Anglican faith ( of 27 million baptized members , only 3,000,000 are registered on parish rolls ) , the Diocese of Southwark is indeed bubbling . And Bishop Stockwood , 50 , a charming and worldly man in whom humility coexists with vanity , gives it another stir almost daily . In the process , he has become perhaps the most storied bishop in England . <P> Southwark slices the British social system from top to bottom . It starts on the tough Thames River docks in the heart of London , runs south through the vast , scruffy slums of Bermondsey , and courses along the commuter train tracks to green suburban Surrey , where Tudor estates and Bentleys abound . An estimated 550,000 confirmed Anglicans live in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches-and collection plates-are full , but in the populous working-class parishes , the pews have never been full . <P> Bow-Tie Bishop . Stockwood came to Southwark in 1959 from a post as vicar of Great St. Mary 's , Cambridge University 's church , where he often sported bow ties instead of dog collar and packed in undergraduate congregations for guest addresses by such speakers as the Labor Party 's Aneurin Bevan and anti-apartheid Bishop Trevor Huddleston . He took his informality right along with him to Southwark . He sometimes takes a morning dip with early-rising parishioners at an open-air pool before starting a full Sunday 's work . Once , by appointment , he called , wearing layman 's clothes , on one of his vicars . The vicar 's wife greeted him at the door , saying , " I 'm afraid you ca n't see him now-he 's expecting the bishop . " A bit later he joined a quiet gathering attended by other bishops wearing black gaiters and aprons . Stockwood was resplendent in purple cassock and cape . " Ah , Mervyn , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Shortly after young Prince Charles , 14 , was caught drinking cherry brandy in a hotel bar in Scotland last month , Bishop Stockwood was introduced to a parishioner 's son at a sherry party on the lawn of a rather staid Surrey rectory . Jovially , he asked the boy : " Have you had your cherry brandy today ? " <P> Theological Fossil . On the theory that getting people talking about the church is a big advantage over the customary apathy , Stockwood has encouraged dissent and nonconformity among his 600 clergymen . In a sermon on the existing moral code at Southwark Cathedral last March , his canon librarian , the Rev. Douglas Rhymes , preached that Christ never suggested that " marriage is the only possible occasion of any expression of physical relationship , " and charged on to say that " much of the prejudice against homosexuality is on the ground that it is unnatural-but for whom ? Certainly not for the homosexual . " <P>                   @ @
