txt DETROIT , Monday , Oct . The American Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers reached new labor agreements early this morning ending a three-day strike against the company 's automo tive operations . The new contract will retain the company 's profit-sharing plan , Edward L. Cushman , American . Motors vice president , and Douglas Fraser , director of the union 's Amefican Motors de ' partment , announced the settlement at 12:30 A.M. after a 10-minute meeting of the union 's American Motors Joint Council , 1 . The agreements did not resolve t'o national issues or cover the company 's Kelvinator appliance division , where negotiations will continue . Mr. Cushman said the agreements would enable the corn : : pany to resume auto production tomorrow morning after losing Itwo full days of output since the AMERICAN MOTORS AND UNION SETTLE // strike began at 1 A.M. Friday . The Kelvinator division makes doors and trim for Rambler cars , he noted , and a delay in settling there eventually could affect auto production . The three-year American Motors national agreement wa-s patterned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford Motor Company and General Motors Corporation . Sources estimated the probable cost of the total contract at 60 to 65 cents an hour over the three years . About 26,000 workers at five plants in three cities were affected by the American Motors strike . 3,000 Remain Out Three thousand Kelvinator workers will remain on strike at Grand Rapids , Mich . The remaining union members will return to work at two auto plants in Milwaukee and two in Kenosha , Wis . The strike resulted after the twi skies disagreed over continuing the profit-sharing concept that was pioneered in their 1961 contract . They finally agreed to continue profit-sharing on a new basis , but by the time an accord was reached on that , the strike deadline had arrived and some national and local issues remained unsolved . Negotiations during the strike concentrated on solving the local disputes at the five plants . Those were finally wrapped  --  up last night , paving the way for the settlement . Bonus Up to $264 The national issues in dispute when the strike began still remain to be solved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . This involves disputes over job transfers , alleged wage inequities and a company demand that the Kelvinator agreement be scaled ' , down from the auto industry level to the appliance industry pattern . The profit-sharing plan at American Motors , which is the only one in the industry , will provide workers an annual cash bonus of up to $264 , depending on the company 's prosperity . The cost of this program could mount to 13.2 cents an hour in a good year , and would add to costs 6.6 cents an hour more than competitors . But the plan promises to be less costly than the previous program , which paid for benefits and stock and cost the company about 8 cents an hour . Demands Dropped Many of the local issues in dispute at American Motors revolved around working conditions . They included such matters as the right of employes to transfer seniority between plants , disagreements over the production standards that control the amount of work a man must do and the ratio of union representatives to members . A company demand for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 36 minutes granted by competitors was also involved . The company dropped its demand for reduced relief time and the union trimmed the ratio of union representatives from one for each 25 workers to one for each 35 workers . But contract language on many of these issues has yet to be worked out and negotiators did not spell out other details . The settlement was reached after a marathon bargaining effort that began at 9:30 A.M. Saturday and continued at various levels for 39 hours . The two sides had reached virtual agreement on a national economic package before the strike and it was apparent from the outset that the walkout would be a. short one . The union leadership had been anxious from the start to settle the strike quickly for fear a prolonged ? walkout would seriously damage the company . American Motors has been counting heavily on its new 1965 model Ramblers to stem a decline in market penetration , and a long strike at the start of the model year could have hurt those prospects .
