In the Southern California landscape , there has sprung up like desert flowers a new variety of artists . They talk of a new esthetic ( " art as a symbolic medium is dead " ) , but these young Angelenos are basically united only by a determination to prove that creativity and innovation can flourish outside New York 's hegemony . " They are just isolated , friendly , ambitious young people who share a fierce outlook , " says James Monte , a curator at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art . " Because they live in a backwater , they had to remake the whole scene . " <P> That they have . A decade ago there were no more than a handful of West Coast painters of note . Today , California embraces the vast , variegated range of op , pop and minimal , not to . mention such homegrown mutations as the weird , surrealistic offshoot known as funk centered around San Francisco . Los Angeles ' particular contribution is an array of bright young individualists who espouse the belief that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents . " We are going beyond abstraction , " argues Robert Irwin , who at 40 is something of a guru to the group . Irwin 's own works are illuminated disks set against a white wall . Others in the group vary widely but are united by a common dedication to " cool " materials far divorced from the conventions of oil paint and bronze-plastics , neon , acrylics , Plexiglas , aluminum . They also share a preoccupation with a visual illusionism that plays with space and color to make the eye see beyond the surface of the work , perhaps inspired by the clear , bright light of Southern California ( on its non-smog-gy days ) . The result , if not so divergent from similar work in the New York orbit as the Californians like to think , nevertheless offers a wide cornucopia of shapes , colors and visual sensations that display genuine individuality and vitality ( see color pages ) . &gt; Craig Kauffman , 36 , studied architecture at the University of Southern California , went on to get a master 's degree in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting on Plexiglas , got the idea of doing rectangular wall pieces when vacuum-molded plastic came into wide commercial use as a sealed wrapping for all kinds of merchandise . Finding no literature on the process , he sought out craftsmen at the commercial factories to learn the technique . Now he himself makes the wood molds in his studio , takes them to a factory , where he supervises the casting process . - Douglas Wheeler , 29 , studied at Los Angeles ' Chouinard Art Institute , and was strongly influenced by Irwin . In 1964 he began experimenting with lights cast onto an easel painting , soon found the canvas format constricting . He rented an old department store in the rundown beach town of Venice , and began transforming entire rooms into oases of light . Today he mounts large , square sheets of Plexiglas on the wall , paints them white , attaches neon tubes behind the edges . By some alchemy of optical illusion , this does funny things to the viewer 's physical orientation-as Wheeler plans . " I want the spectator to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting and feel that if you walk into it , you 'll be in another world , " says he .
