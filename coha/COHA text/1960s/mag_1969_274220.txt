You know , I am an old man , a very old man . An old man likes to have a little air of mystery about himself . I like to hold on to my little mysteries . - HoChiMinh , 1962 <P> Ho CHI MINH held on to his little mysteries very skillfully indeed , and to much larger ones as well . The face that he presented to the world was that of an avuncular , slightly shabby poet , yet he was a dedicated , often ruthless Communist for half a century . He impressed most visitors with his gentleness , but no man can hold together a Communist Party for nearly 40 years , as he did , without an iron hand . He seemed fragile as a dried leaf , but he endured privation , prison and grueling pressures , and still survived for nearly eight decades . <P> When North Viet Nam 's President died of a heart attack in Hanoi last week at the age of 79 , he left an impressive legacy of accomplishment . He had restored a sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a form of " national Communism " that left him out of both the Chinese and the Soviet orbits , but prompted both powers to court him . With the limited resources of a tiny impoverished Asian nation-and with vast help from Peking and Moscow-he had withstood the enormous firepower of the mightiest industrial nation on earth . In so doing , he had forced one U.S. President out of office and tarnished the bright memory of another . He had reached deep into American society through a war that affects the disaffected young , the restless blacks , the threatened guardians of old values-the country 's very image of itself . <P> Ho Chi Minh 's life was dedicated to the creation of a unified Viet Nam , free from foreign control , and the 19 million people of his tortured land suffered mightily from his total devotion to that vision . Even so , they affectionately knew him as " Bac Ho " ( Uncle Ho ) . So did many in the South . No national leader alive today has stood so stubbornly for so long before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far-reaching repercussions in North Viet Nam , in Asia and beyond . <P> Change will not come tomorrow , for Ho and other leaders had tried to lay the groundwork for a tranquil succession . Over the past several years , Ho had gradually moved away from the day-to-day exercise of power , turning over routine responsibilities to a triumvirate consisting of Premier Pham Van Dong , Party First Secretary Le Duan and high-ranking Politburo Member Truong Chinh , all in their early 60s ( see box , page 28 ) . For the immediate future , Ho 's title will probably be taken by Vice President Ton Due Thang , an 81-year-old nonentity . Actual power will probably be wielded by the triumvirate-plus Defense Minister Vo Nguyen Giap , 57. * <P> Eventually , a single leader is likely to emerge . As U.S. Analyst Douglas Pike puts it : " They 'll agree not to get grabby . But I have no faith in collective leadership . They will all claim the mantle of Ho Chi Minh , and they will start to get grabby . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
