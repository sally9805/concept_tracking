Drama Mailbag : Pro and Con Pinter 's ' Homecoming ' To THE EDITOR : EVEN though reviewers on the American dailies have tossed no hats in the air over " The Homecoming , " Harold Pinter needs no champions . This latest play is another of his survival kits on " the rugged hill " of truth . Even if he had been unable to command the attention and enthusiastic approbation of his country 's most distinguished critics and educated audience for the past year and a half , he has the continued tribute of a company of actors as fresh and accurate in their perceptions as when I first saw them in this play in London in 1965 . Their performance matches his writing , elegance for elegance . If even this were not so and his play had been cast with lesser men and mounted by lesser men than Peter Hall and John Bury , Mr. Pinter is blessed as few playwrights are , For he is married to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks on stage that she knows with her whole being exactly what he is about . Her performance is a celebration for which we can all eventually be grateful . It was John Donne who spoke of truth as " a rugged hill " and he who would reach it " about must , and about must go .

CHARLES-CARSHON Theater Faculty Sarah Lawrence College Bronxville , N. Y. ? NOT FOR KIDDIES To THE EDITOR : " Homecoming " is advertised es a family play , but do n't bring the kiddies . Not only because the play is without plot , has parrot-like dialogue and cardboard characters , but because they would n't believe that this is a family . Which it is n't . But it is amoral , immoral and unmoral and not even the clipped Oxford accent of the Royal Shakespeare Company can mask this . However , too often these accents are chewed , instead of clipped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final syllables end much of what passes for dialogue is lost . Thank Heaven . Mr. Pinter , the author , in an interview appearing in the Times of Jan. 1 , admits that he causes offense for its own sake . This kind of " offense " could well be called " Pintercourse " and that , dear Editor , is the most degrading kind . It is interesting to note that he knows enough about playwriting to claim that he writes with shape , structure and over-all unity in mind . One sees- no evidence of this as he takes us from the sick sick to the dirty sick . I write this in sincere protest of this " **33;493;TOOLONG " theater . LILIAN DE RECTOR New Rochelle , N. Y. MODERN ALLEGORY To THE EDITOR : Walter Kerr 's review of " The Homecoming " not only does the play an injustice but also completely misses what I feel to be the central point of the play . This is a clever , compactly designed allegory , about a modern Everyman in his relationship to Woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a man of seventy , " " a man of sixty-three , " continuing down to Joey , " a man in his middle twenties . " The father and his three sons  --  the Professor , the Procurer , the Pugilist  --  reecho the tripartite composite of Dostoevski himself in " The Brothers Karamazov " : Ivan the Intellectual , Alyosha the Spiritual Moralist , Dimitri the Sensualist . The Professor is detached Mind , relating to experience objectively , logically . The Procurer portrays moral involvement . He is the religious unbeliever , dialectically involved in sin and redemption . He mocks the father , cynically discourses on God and the moral order , and yet admits that he was some-how restrained by an imperative from killing a girl under the bridge when he could have gotten away with it . His cynicism , his hatred and his disgust with man reveal the religious Calvinist doctrine of the total depravity of man . The Pugilist is the " id , " the instinctual , physical nature of man . FINAL CURTAIN " Dinner at Eight , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed last night after 127 performances . The Father , a man in his seventies , is partly progenitor and partly a kind of Greek chorus recalling his role as a virile patriarch and husband . His role is counterpointed by the Uncle , impotent , servile and completely passive , who served as the liaison between the mother and , a liaison which produced the Professor ( illegitimate birth of the Mind Athena springing from the head of Zeus ) . Observe the affinity of the impotent male ? the Uncle ? with the Professor : pure mind being incapable of action . Ruth , the professor 's wife , exists only through the eyes of the male characters in the play . To the impotent Uncle , she is non-existent . Onstage neither one sees the other . To the Professor ( Mind ) she is is an object , a creature in a scientific experiment , involving the behavior of a prostitute when the middle class wife-mother role is imposed upon her . To the Procurer she ( like all women ) is the bitch , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a soft , kittenish counterpart of the aggressive male . To the Father , she is a memory and an illusory hope for rejuvenation . The direction and staging of the play are excellent , with thorough understanding of the play 's purpose by the actors . The characters speak their lines incommunicado : no one hears the other . Mind is rarely heard by Conscience or by Instinct . Choreographically , the actors arrange themselves as though they are parts of the whole . Note how well this was done when the curtain rose at the beginning of the second act . All five men were grouped in a very close circle , enveloped by cigar smoke . The raising and lowering of the hands when they put their cigars to their lips was simultaneous and coordinated . I think the play is clearly and architectonically structured . It is an interesting allegorical interpretation of man in a modern setting , SAMUEL SLEEPER Oxford , Mass . RESISTANCE POINT To THE EDITOR : If one scans the theatrical " HELLO , DOLLY ! " ? Merchant David Burns counts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the St. James tomorrow . pages these days , one finds that Walter Kerr thinks Barbara Harris irresistible , Norman Wisdom irresistible and Neil Simon 's " Barefoot in the Park " irresistibly funny . Yet he finds Edward Albee'a " A Delicate Balance , " Frank Marcus ' " The Killing of Sister George " and Harold Pinter 's " The Homecoming " resistible . It seems to me that since September , 1966 , the position of drama critic for The Times has gone unoccupied . CHARLES IRWIN CHOSET New York City FOR A NEW LAW To THE EDITOR : I think it 's about time a law was passed to protect responsible drama critics from irresponsible theatergoers . Recently you published a spew of letters attacking Walter Kerr on the following grounds ( 1 ) he 's a tattletale , because he quoted some jokes from " Do n't Drink the Water " ; ( 2 ) he lacks " humanism , " because he reacted against the mawkish goodwill of " My Sweet Charlie " ; ( 3 ) he 's " unbalanced , " since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourse " of Weiss 's " The Investigation . " I have no idea how the author of " Mary , Mary " can possibly live with an unbalanced , inhumane tattletale , but while we 're all pondering this , I propose that drama critics consider this rule : not to read letters from irate theatergoers unless the writers can prove that they have as much wit , sensitivity and perception as the men they so generously attack . J. R. CATINELLA . Forest Hills , N. Y. EXPERIMENT IS NOT ALL To THE EDITOR : The debate between Robert Brustein and his detractors appears to resolve itself into the ancient struggle between the relative value of the traditional and the experimental and what the proper balance between the two should be . From the nature of the reported production of " Viet Rock , " it would certainly appear that Mr. Brustein is primarily interested in the experimental at the expense of the traditional . Certainly , the Tulane Drama Review states unequivocally its devotion to the idea that the traditional is as good as useless in the contemporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the far-out , in terms of actor training and play stimulation . There is nothing evil about experimentation in itself , nor in the use of the documentary approach , which has been going on in our theater since the days of The Living Newspaper . What the gentleman from North Carolina fears is that the actors at Yale will not also get sufficient training in how to perform the classics which they will be required to perform in most of the new provincial repertory theaters , such as the Trinity Square Playhouse of Providence , and the metropolitan repertory theaters , such as the A.P.A . company , which are so happily enlarging our theater culture at present . If that is true , then it would be a sorry state of things for the ability of these graduates to secure and to retain paying jobs as repertory theater actors . The day of what is called in England the " kitchen sink " actor is rapidly coming to an end ; with the result that it looks as if Mr. Brustein 's training program might be perilously close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . However , if his actors can also put on a first-rate production of " The Recruiting Officer , " or of " Tango " in the required styles , then he is on the right track . But a theater which prepares its actors only to perform in plays such as " The Brig , " " The Connection , " " Viet Rock , " " Oh , What a Lovely War ! " and so on , hamstrings its actors . I think this is what Mr. Brustein 's opponents feel Alarmed he might be permitting to happen at Yale . FITZROY DAVIS New York City .
