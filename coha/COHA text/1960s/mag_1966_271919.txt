Where 's Daddy ? by William Inge , is another of those plays that everyone has read before it was written . It involves no drama , no personal vision , no character , no insight-just a leaf-through of the dog-eared topics of the day . The evening 's menu of fashionable clichs includes : Generations-in conflict . The Young-Jacobins in blue jeans looking for any old Bastille to storm . The Negro-visible and vocal , and there must be two or the producer will be accused of " token " integration . Middle-aged Mothers-so square they are cubes . The Homosexual-not really a bad chap . <P> Amid eroding plaster and stacked-up cardboard cartons live two newlywedded bohemian idiots , young free-spirited disasters of innocence and honesty . He , execrably played by Beau Bridges , and she , execrably played by Barbara Dana , are about to become parents in name only . Their immediate life plan consists of divorce for themselves , adoption for their unborn child . In intellectual hock to his psychoanalyst , Beau has convinced Barbara that he and she are emotionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sherman is a proper-minded homosexual , more censorious than Cato the Elder . He has raised Beau since the lad was a 15-year-old pickup in a gay bar , and he is disgusted with Beau 's flibbertigibbet irresponsibility . Sherman 's performance is an up tick in a dramatic bear market , but he does n't keep the play from sliding inexorably toward its happy bankrupt ending . <P> Bad luck comes in threes : the past eight weeks have provided a melancholy chapter in U.S. dramatic history . Tennessee Williams ( Slapstick Tragedy ) , Edward Albee ( Malcolm ) and William Inge have written by far their worst plays .
