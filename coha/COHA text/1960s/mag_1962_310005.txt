U.S.-Soviet postwar relations have gone through cycles of freeze and mild thaw-but the Kennedy Administration has experienced mainly cold weather . When Kennedy first took office , he naively conveyed a request for a six-month moratorium on Communist crisis stirring while his Administration got its house in order . <P> For a few weeks it seemed as if he might get it , especially after the Soviet Union released two imprisoned U.S. RB-47 flyers . But the Kremlin soon set about a round of troublemaking that challenged the U.S. from Laos to Berlin . Tension reached its peak with the erection of the Berlin wall and the Soviet Union 's resumption of nuclear testing on a monster scale . It looked as if President Kennedy 's flinty remark to a flinty Khrushchev at Vienna- " It 's going to be a cold winter " - would prove all too true . But last week , after long months in which Moscow has hardly let Kennedy take a deep breath , the tension seemed to be relaxing a little . At his press conference the President was cautiously optimistic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are making every effort that we can to bring an easing of tensions . ' ' <P> What was happening was that several U.S. and Soviet officials were talking and smiling at one another-and hinting that they would like to do more talking and smiling . Off to Paris went White House Press Secretary Pierre Salinger for a meeting with Mikhail Kharlamov , press officer of the Soviet Foreign Ministry . And into Washington , at President Kennedy 's invitation , flew Aleksei Adzhubei , editor of Izvestia and son-in-law of Premier Nikita Khrushchev . <P> Vodka &; Violins . In a day and a night in Paris , Salinger had two meetings with Kharlamov ( whom he soon began calling Mike ) - in the Paris home of Cecil Lyon , minister of information in the U.S. Paris embassy , and in the grey-walled Soviet embassy on Rue de Grenelle . While Salinger puffed on cigars , the pair were served vodka and caviar , discussed press relationships and other communication channels between the U.S. and the Soviet Union . Inevitably , the meetings gave rise to rumors that Salinger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salinger denied it " on a stack of Bibles . " One thing that Salinger and Kharlamov did talk about : a possible exchange of TV appearances between Kennedy and Khrushchev-either separately on each other 's national screens or on a single TV show in both nations through the use of tape . <P> Adzhubei and his wife Rada broke off a South American tour to answer the President 's invitation , got the full Kennedy treatment in Washington . They lunched with the Kennedys on pheasant and wild rice , were welcomed to the President 's press conference , and were introduced to Caroline Kennedy , who had in tow her dog Pushinka , a gift from Premier Khrushchev . Adzhubei had a private talk with Kennedy that was described only as " wide-ranging , " " candid " and " not uncordial " ; Jackie Kennedy took Rada on a tour of the White House nursery . The Adzhubeis also took a meal with the Bobby Kennedys , about to leave on a world tour , and with the Salingers . Later , Salinger took them on a boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 , played The Star-Spangled Banner on his violin as the boat passed the George Washington mansion at Mount Vernon .
