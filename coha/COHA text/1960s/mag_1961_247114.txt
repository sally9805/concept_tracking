Still stunned by the recent wave of art thefts , the galleries of Europe are wiring themselves for sound . Last week an exhibition opened in Munich of 400 works by Toulouse-Lautrec . If a thief so much as touches one . an alarm will go off . London 's National Gallery and Tate Gallery are considering placing their pictures in a new kind of mat-a thin layer of foam rubber sandwiched between two foil sheets that are wired to the wall . It will do a thief no good to cut the wires , for the alarm will go off anyway . Price per mat : $10 to $15.
