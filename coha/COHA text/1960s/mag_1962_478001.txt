A woman whose marriage breaks up nowa- days has to give an account of herself . For precisely to the extent that divorce has become an everyday occurrence in America , it is no longer to be easily understood . Divorces used to be very concrete affairs , for there was no mistaking the meaning of those situations in which a husband beat his wife , abandoned her , fell in love with another woman , or was impotent ? or in which a wife stayed out all night , drank too much , refused her husband her favors , or was sterile . There was no mistaking them , and the law itself provided for them . But with one out of every four marriages in this country scheduled for the courts , it is no longer possible to think of divorce as a dramatic last recourse for people suffering in such situations . It can not be that so many millions of marriages have been " bad " in the was that law and tradition have always understood ? or perhaps in any way at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that she is in her late twenties , fairly well educated , of moderate to decent means , with a couple of small children , formerly married to a male counterpart of herself ? explain what drove her and her husband to such a drastic step ? She will clearly not claim to have been mistreated or neglected . Nor will she admit to any significantly bad behavior on her own part . Chances are she and her husband have been unfaithful to one another , but in a way that at the time did not seem relevant to their feelings for one another . She will not even say that she no longer cares about him . A prominent New York lawyer once told me , " Once upon a time most of my divorce clients were sheepish middle-aged men who , against what they knew to be all reason , were leaving their devoted middle-aged wives and families for MIDGE DECTER the young girls they had fallen in love with . Now I see only young women who tell me , ' He is a nice boy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a nice time in bed , and we have rarely ever quarreled . I want out , that 's all . ' " Having no further explanation than this , our divorcee will be felt by everyone around her to he selfish and irresponsible , at the least seriously neurotic . And during that first gorgeous burst of guilt , toward children , parents ? of course husband ? she is apt to feel so , too . The guilt will persist for a long time , if not forever ? possibly it will send her to the office of a psychological counselor ? but she will nevertheless maintain a dumb certainty that the reasons for her decision are right and real . But what , if she can not even speak of them , can these reasons he ? The commonest twentieth-century answer for anything that renders people imprecise or inarticulate is , sex . Herbert Gold once wrote that divorce germinates in the first moment a person looks beyond his or her spouse with the eyes of sexual desire . Mr. Louis Nizer , a vastly experienced attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handled a divorce whose real cause , when dug deeply enough for , was not sexual incompatibility . Sex is the most obvious answer ? indeed it begins to seem that there can be no public discussion of divorce if we have not the " courage " to get straight to the problem of the orgasm ? but nevertheless an unreal one . In any case , our about-to-be-divorced woman would not honestly offer it ; she might even suggest that in her collapsing marriage sex was the last , not the first , thing to go . For her , as for Herbert Gold , divorce germinated in a particular moment , too , but in a different one . Her divorce began in that moment when she first conceived divorce to be a possibility for her . She can arrive at divorce because however shocking the figure one in four may be , it is a respectable one . Divorce is now openly offered as a solution to the malaise of life by her time and her culture . NOTHING REALLY WRONG T he divorcee 's experience in marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends who remain married . She had in fact a good marriage , by any reasonable , and by some fairly unreasonable , standards . She and her husband were a good wife and husband by altogether unreasonable ones . When she married she was very young and very high-minded and more than a little pretentious . Her pretensions , moreover ? if one must have them ? were of the best kind , having mostly to do with being superior to all sorts of pettiness . If after her divorce she was open to the charges of selfishness and irresponsibility , in the years before she would have found very little in this regard to reproach herself for . She and her husband had had a few ugly moments , over her first pregnancy , over a flirtation , over anxiety about money , but these are standard ugly moments and were recovered from quickly and high-mindedly . The major principle governing their conduct toward one another ? and there were many ? was fairness . At the time of their wedding her husband had been a student , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was pleased to work for a while to help support the family . And her vanity was tickled , though she was sometimes inclined to feel a little overtender toward herself , by the thought of all she was cheerfully doing without . Because she was working , then unaidedly taking care of her babies , her husband on his side became competent at several forms of housework , notably cooking and dishwashing . ( Domestically competent husbands have become a kind of obscene joke in the literature of suburban life : but it was " not like that " with them . They were only two busy people sharing unpleasant duties . As a matter of fact , they firmly disapproved of suburban marriage . ) They were good friends , committed to supporting one an-other 's demands , committed to understanding one another 's point of view . They were often intense lovers . They had become lovers , in the usual way of these things , a few months before marriage , And were somewhat anxiously , though on the whole fruitfully , concerned about the quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " they knew ; and each of them took on the obligation to he ever more " satisfactory " to the other . If there was anything a little less than proper in their relation to life , it was a certain tendency they had to find their own relationship so deeply promising by comparison with other people 's . ( More than once they were known to be in a state of deep compassion for the difficulties of that wife or the other husband . ) And this is the marriage that broke down in its prime , after ten years : far from the adolescent 's Hollywood dream of romance-ever-after , and farther even from the battle of neurotic projections and misplaced aggressions ? to which social critics and mental healthers so confidently attribute broken marriages . Theirs was a relation rooted in the values of responsibility and maturity , acceptance and consideration . The divorcee , looking back , might find some of this description delusory ; but if so , she also knows that her delusions felt real enough to her at the time . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long talks " from which they both knew there was no returning , she may suddenly have found herself powerfully irritated by things in him she had never objected to before . But such irritation was a signal rather than a substance , and provided her with the feeling of disgruntlement necessary for getting through the act of separation . What had really happened was something she herself could only describe allegorically . She had " looked into the mirror one morning " and for the first time feeling truly young ? in the sense that she saw years and years of life stretching before her ? asked herself in horror , " Is this all there is going to be forever ? " Now , this question is nothing new ; it is probably asked with the same horror at least once in every lifetime . In her case , however , it was inevitably to have dire consequences for her marriage . People like our young divorcee arc taught to believe that marriage must be the means for fulfilling all their personal needs . It is as wives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arid admirable , excited and exciting . And since marriage is that which stamps the quality of their being , rather than simply assuring the physical arrangements for it , any dissatisfaction with self goes right to the heart of married life . Divorce for such people is not an act of immaturity ; they ask nothing more from marriage than they have been willing to put into it . They have been willing to put too much ( hut only as much , be it noted , as the wise counselors of stability have said was needed to water the gardens of the Good Life ) . They have to extricate themselves completely in order to effect any change at all . So much did her divorce have to do with restlessness about herself , and so little with all those carefully nourished resentments against her husband , that he quickly seemed to fade from the proceedings . Be that as it may , in the lawyer 's office neither she nor her husband was important , but rather a whole host of things about the relations between a married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the things lawyers and courts deem important : money , for one ; real property ; legal obligation ; the respective functions of male and female parents ; .. in the event of death . " She had gone to see a lawyer because to do so marked the seriousness of her intentions , and also because she knew , though she could not really imagine , that she would one day have to appear in court . But she could not have said why this should be so ; she regarded divorce law as a fiction of the official imagination . She and her husband . of all people , needed no outsiders to effect some arrangement between them . Her lawyer was patient with her . He had seen her kind before : it would be a matter of explaining that civilized and honorable as she felt , the possibility of unpleasant contingencies and demeaning impulses must be provided for ; that his way of providing was best because it was impersonal . What would she do , for instance , if her husband took it into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpectedly greedy about money , or if ? after all , there were cases known ? they began to fight over the children ? The lawyer entered into their discussions with the kind of relish that people reserve for deflating foolishness . In his system of instruction money came first because it was the hardest ? money being such an obvious thing for people to pretend they care nothing about . The property was not enough to bother the law with ? some furniture , books , records , a car . Naturally there would be no alimony ; alimony is the blood-money that goes to women whose husbands are desperate to divorce them . But she was asked to consider how much money was needed to maintain the children each week . And slowly she began to reduce her life , past and future , into figures and claims and demands that could be put down on paper . Whose life ought to be insured ? How often would her husband see the children ? How would they settle questions about religion , education ? By the time they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found her legs in the lawyer 's world , where real and hard things might happen , even to her . Finally she signed a document called a separation agreement . Only in deciding the terms of her divorce had she discovered what society means by marriage . At college she would not have taken a marriage course , nor would she have read marriage " manuals " ; but even if she had , she would never have learned that getting married involves people in legal rights and obligations . The law , then , was not an arbitrary imposition on her private affairs . It was the last bastion wherein society holds out against the vagaries and self-deceptions of personal feeling . For her the discovery was enormous : not only because it forced her to talk about herself in a real way , but because it taught her for the first time that her womanly nastiness and her husband 's manly nastiness were so dear to the world as to have been institutionally provided for . So , far from feeling cheapened by the law , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They could not be divorced in the state where they lived because of the stringent grounds that state imposed . They found another state which offered her a not quite fraudulent residence , and in which the courts were not so precise . Several months after he had moved out of their house , she stood before a judge and testified under oath that her husband had abused her in several ugly but vaguely described ways . HOT BATHS AND PEANUT BUTTER E Yen for those most unhappy about it , divorce sets off a wholesale round of self-indulgence . A woman is apt to buy a new wardrobe , for instance , and a man a new car ; or perhaps it will be the other way around . The main thing is , they must signalize ? and primarily in things that involve the expenditure of money ? their new condition of not being implicated in one another 's needs . It may even he essential to spend more money than one can afford . Certainly two together can live more cheaply than two apart , even allowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally , the divorcee has gone back to work ) . For divorce does away with dependent priorities . It no longer affects the woman 's plans that the man needs a new suit ; or his , that she is longing for a silver coffee pot . Their needs and longings they have to themselves now . Spending money is essential , but there are other indulgences as well . The divorcee finds that she likes to lie in the tub for hours every night without having to excuse herself ; or to eat a peanut butter sandwich for dinner without having to explain herself ; or to frown , sigh , giggle without having to tell her thoughts . She feels released as she has never felt in her life . I make her sound too lighthearted , perhaps . Does she then pay no price at all for turning over what is after all still a sacred institution , for disrupting her family , for creating God knows what unhappiness for her children ? The answer to this question can not be a simple yes or no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care . She has a lonely responsibility for her children six days a week ; their problems and her involvement in them are now intensified a hundredfold by her sense of the children 's deprivation . Verylikely she has embarked on the career she had once been so pointedly careless about . And through all this she has lost the support of that ready sympathy having a husband had always provided her . She worries a great deal , not only about her children , but about her health ( so much depends on her ! ) , her job , the state of her household , the condition of her soul . Still , it is her worry , she is answerable to no adult . She is paying her way and making her way ; her behavior brings its own consequences and she asks no one to share them with her . She has a great sense of accomplishment because she now knows what she can do , however inadequately , however self-pityingly , alone . This knowledge is important just because her marriage had been primarily the condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another personality . All of this is to say that she feels strong . And strength breeds its own gaiety . Her family and friends tend to be wary of the divorcee 's insouciance , however grateful that she does not make a nuisance of herself . They could so much easier forgive her the trouble she is in if only she would appear more troubled by it ? if only she would not so often parry their lugubrious expressions of sympathy with assurances that she is fine , thank you . But along with her new dresses she shamelessly persists in affording herself others of the world 's goodies . She will not say her marriage was tragic , she will not say her divorce is tragic , she will not even say her children are tragic , she does not want forgiveness . She might even feel herself entitled to a bit of admiration . If her high spirits continue , she finds that she is being treated less as a problem than as a threat . A threat to something as high-sounding as " the fabric of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she cares to be explicit ? as the marriages all around her . She can see in the eyes of even her closest female friend a momentary flicker of anxiety as she addresses herself to the friend 's husband : not that she is fatally attractive , but after all , her moment of possibility can breed others just as others once bred hers . And smiling and managing , she makes the whole thing look MO easy . COUPLES ' WORLD B ut she does not want a husband ? not yet ? not even someone else 's . She is against not only marriage but any form of entanglement . She wants , she says , to move into that new special underground of " toughness " and " truth " ( for how let her pleasure in the lawyer 's office slip away so quickly ? ) . And curious things have begun to happen to her social life . For one ' hung , despite their many protestations , most of the friends of her married life have disappeared from view . Some of them have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither . It is not so much a matter of their disapproving of her or taking sides against her ? " civilized " divorces leave very little occasion for that ? but of the great strain in maintaining social contact with two people who must be kept apart . There are certain dutiful invitations to a quiet dinner , and then silence . Anyway it is more natural and convenient for people to spend time with others in their own situation . Just as she was once pulled into the orbit of young families , she now finds herself easier with those who are footloose in some way . She is dating again , like a young girl , and involved in a young girl 's delicate problems -- onlythis time without the advantages of innocence . If her having been married now makes impossible a certain dreamy anticipation , by the same token it makes her much more sensitive to the real game of men and women . She can be coy if she needs to , but no longer without feeling foolish . Men had begun to call her up almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not because she is fatally attractive but because she is available . Somewhere in the club of divorced men and no-longer-young bachelors there hangs a great bulletin board on which are posted the day 's new crop of divorced or widowed women . Old acquaintances , sometimes strangers , call her up : will she have lunch , dinner , cocktails ? These men are vast consumers of female companionship , being as they are inhabitants of a world that makes it somehow unpleasant for people to do such things as eat in restaurants , attend the theatre , or even arrive at parties , alone . And they seem to consume women ? either by not being pleased with them or by marrying them ? at a rate much faster than women of suitable age and circumstance can be produced . She has , then , every opportunity to be consoled for her loss of a steady escort . Moreover , there is for her ( as there is not for her would-be beaux , condemned by their singleness to be caught in the toils of female vanity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of the curiosity it is now in her power to satisfy . She has no intention of being alone and virtuous ? there is nothing left in her values to uphold such an intention . But with each invitation comes the question , What is this appointment for ? Even though , or perhaps because , she knows the answer ? that the matter is entirely up to her ? the question makes her gauche . For can she be so indelicate as to indicate to a man who does not really interest her that no , she will not have cocktails with him because she does not want to go to bed with him ? On the other hand , if she simply went to have cocktails , could she endure that moment when by word or deed her position was put to the question and she had to find a kind way of turning him down ? The divorcee is a woman whose unanswerable question , " Why should you expect me to sleep with you ? " can be met with the equally unanswerable one , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from marriage above all that too much fuss is made over the sex thing ? She has , but the lesson is one that goes both ways , and therefore nowhere . She can ask herself one night , What difference does it make ; but then as easily ask the following morning , Was it for this I gave up hearth and husband ? Young girls do n't have to be kind in refusal , indeed are expected not to be . But she , no virgin , no child , asking so hard for kindness herself , must find a graceful out , if it is an out she wants . Her problem is no less real for being utterly ridiculous . It is no less real , either , for being so incongruous with the rest of her daily life . She is no scarlet woman , but a responsible mother of two children . Her days describe not a madcap round of high life and sexy adventure but a rather sobering routine of work , household management , and motherhood . She has a housekeeper looking after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she scrupulously , even compulsively , reserves for them is time filled with the notion that they come first . How her children are really responding to the divorce she does not know and probably will not know for years . if ever , Contrary to current theory , children do not act out their sufferings but reserve them carefully to some future retribution . They do let her know , however , that they will never again be able to regard the universe as quite a safe place . She prides herself on being truthful with them ; and she will not assure them that it is a safe place . But she does fix little daily patterns , new family customs , for them . If she knows there is something forced and a little pitiful in their festive dinners together . their two-stories-and-song before bedtime , she still takes some comfort in " doing the right thing . " All children today no less than hers are being brought up by a system of canned inspiration ? and what other is better ? She tells them the moll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wonderful daddy . She tells them the truth about themselves , that they do not understand now but one day will . She brings them , so far as is possible . into her outside life . They visit her office and meet the men with whom she goes to dinner . Her children will not be actually responsible for the serious new love affair on which she embarks in a year or two , but they will be one of its contributing conditions . For children set her life onto what is , with or without a man , a settled domestic plateau , and to some extent define her aspirations for the future . Family life can not he maintained beyond a certain limit of irregularity ? at least not without a great deal of money it ca n't . Anyway , the divorcee has long since found that her restlessness was not a striving toward freedom but simply the will to change her life a little . Even so modest an ambition probably can not be satisfied . And certainly it can not long hold out against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult world is set up for couples . Restaurants and theatres , we have said , drive men who have otherwise escaped them into the clutches of women . Many things more bring men and women , however reluctant , permanently together : from housing to hypocrisy , nearly everything involved in the delicate network of physical and social comforts , In the current discussion of society 's powerlessness to prevent the dissolution of all those marriages , no one seems to mention society 's fantastic efficiency in creating new ones . The demographers tell us that for every hundred men and women divorced by the age of thirty-nine , ninety-three of the former and eighty-five of the latter will remarry ; such is the high rate of " belief " in marriage among the divorced ? or , rather , the high rate of discovery that there is no viable alternative to it . NEW PRINCIPLES TO KEEP HER WARM T he divorcee now thinks she sees very clearly what is wrong with marriage , truths at- ' ays known and only lately forgotten : that it ref-mires a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to supply ; that it is not a higher sexual fulfillment but a sexual limitation ; not an achievement but a hindrance to achievement : not a challenge but the refusal of challenge . What is more important , marriage need not be any of the things her contemporaries ? particularly American ones ? pretend . Its proper justification is the one that her own futurc marriage will have : namely , it is the most sensible economic and physical arrangement available for most people 's lives . If marriage provides this much , it fills the purpose for which mankind intended it . Hard-headed as our divorcee has become , nevertheless for a while she will deceive herself and her new lover about the nature of their affair . She will feel too keenly the costliness of permanent commitment to admit that she is leading him into marriage . They will have fun together , she will say , and be friends , and she will demand very little of him and allow very little to be demanded in return . Her lover will know enough not to believe her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once ? but he will feel that if in the end lie must have a woman , hers are not such bad terms . Of course she will make inordinate demands on him , and he on her ; and of course they will not be ? never were ? friends in the way she means . Soon the fun will go out of just being together , and she will tend to get querulous about the need to be discreet . She will want to create some definition of his relations with her children . She will grow afraid of losing him . One day she will place the ultimatum before him , and he will capitulate . Still , her early deception will bespeak a sort of ideal vision of their future together ; her very rhetoric will impose certain standards of behavior which , if he can not hold her to them , will yet help to free them both a tittle from the necessity for being constantly adequate to one another . And so , in two-and-a-half years from her appearance in court , the divorcee will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chastened , a little fearful , but with a whole new set of principles to keep her warm . Her new husband will try manfully , but not without complaint , to manage his sudden acquisition of an ongoing household with children . The children will set out on their lifelong game of familial musical chairs : to Daddy 's on Sunday , while Step-daddy 's little boy takes their place at home ; marching along somehow in the parade of four parents , siblings , half-siblings , step-siblings , new cousins , new aunts and uncles , and a few extra grandparents . One can hope that her new pretensions ? to the marriage of limited expectations ? will serve her better than the old ones .
