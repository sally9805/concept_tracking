txt Governor Rockefeller and Senator Robert F. Kennedy presented ' sharply conflicting views at a five-state Federal hearing today on what part New York should play in the projected cleanup of Lake Erie . The Republican Governor said that any Lake Erie contamination originating in New York would be cleaned up under his $1.7 billion pollution program , and that what the state wanted mainly from Washington was money . The Democratic Senator , appearing a few minutes previously before an assemblage of 300 , declared that a United States Public Health Service report on waste flows from the Buffalo area was " a serious indictment of the State of New York . " He urged that New York State join in an interstate Erie cleanup program drafted last week by Michigan , Ohio and Indiana in collaboration with Federal officials . Senator Jacob K. Javits , a Republican , sent a message to the hearing that gave some support to both views . " Pollution of interstate waters such as Lake Erie can not be controlled by a single state alone , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some of the money needed to help us to ) ielp ourselves . " ' The hearing , which began today at the Statler Hilton Hotel , was a continuation of sessions that started a week ago at Cleveland . They are the first stage of a pollution abatement proceeding initiated by the Department of Health , Education and Welfare under Federal law at the request of Ohio . A two-year study of the 240-1 mile lake by Public Health Service experts has indicated that its waters are deteriorating rapidly from the constant massive influx of sewage and industrial wastes mainly from the metropolitan areas of Detroit , Toledo , Cleveland , Erie , Pa. , and Buffalo . The lake is a majot water supply source for the communities and industries of an Erie Basin population of 10 million , and might figure eventually in some solution to New York City 's water ' shortage . The Federal abatement proceeding is aimed at producing remedial measures and schedules , which then can be enforced against all individual pollution sources in the basin . The Pennsylvania representa tive at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Health , contended that the Public Health Service study had produced no conclusive evidence that Pennsylvania was involved in any interstate pollution either as a source or a recipient . But he said Pennsylvania would join ' in formulating interstate conclusions and recommendations . Governor Rockefeller 's $1.7 billion state antipollution campaign would be financed largely by a proposed $1 billion bond issue that will be put to voters on the November ballot . The money would be used to help communities build sewage treatment facilities . The Governor said at a news conference today that at tomorrow 's White House conference on interstate water problems centering on New York City he would ask for a Federal grant to help finance a comprehensive state water resources survey as the " second step " after the remedying of pollution . " The extent of interstate pollution from New York is very small in comparison to the pollution from the ' upstream states , " he told the hearing . " The great bulk of pollution from New York in this area does not add to Interstate pollution and thus is intrastate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be dealt with and eliminated if - the bond issue is approved by the voters this fall . " Noting that Senator Kennedy had proposed that New York request Federal enforcement of pollution abatement within its borders , the Governor continued : " There would be no benefit to New York in terms of its intrastate pollution problem from such Federal enforcement . We would receive no extra financial assistance . Indeed such Federal enforcement activity could only serve to duplicate and hinder state action , confuse and diffuse responsibility . " Any cleanup program and schedule arrived at by participants at the hearing will be binding on New York , if Federal investigators produce legal proof that its pollution is interstate . Senator Kennedy declared that New York had a crucial interest in the interstate effort . " If this pollution worsens , the 835,000 people in New York State and the 2,442,000 In other states who draw their drinking water directly from Lake Erie will have to turn to other sources , " he said , " If Lake Erie becomes clogged with algae and the pollution level rises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallons a day for power generation and 350 million gallons for cooling or other processes , would be severely crippled . "
