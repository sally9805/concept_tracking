At a Brussels auction last year , Antique Dealer Victor van Uytrecht noticed two handsome 18th century bronze busts of Roman soldiers in coats of mail . He bought them and took them back home to Namur . There , Van Uytrecht 's partner and stepson noticed that one of the heads seemed a bit loose . When he tried to tighten it , the bust came apart . Inside was a wooden box , bound with red silk bands and heavy seals , inscribed Cap . S. Felicis . M. <P> The dealers promptly called in a neighbor priest , who identified the box as a reliquary and the inscription as meaning Caput Sancti Felicis Martyr ( the head of St. Felix , Martyr ) . When church officials cut the ribbons and opened the box , a yellow skull wrapped in red silk stared out at them . <P> Scientific tests of cloth and bone proved to the church 's satisfaction that it was in deed St. Felix 's head . The skull hidden in the other bust was identified as that of his friend and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the saints were Moorish soldiers in the army of the Emperor Diocletian , stationed in what is now Milan in about A.D. 303 . Under repeated torture they refused to renounce their Christian faith . At last they were both beheaded , and their remains were eventually buried in Milan 's oldest Christian cemetery . Turned over to the keeping of the Franciscans , the heads and bodies remained together until the Napoleonic wars , when the headless bodies ended up in Milan 's ancient St. Ambrose Church . How and when the heads found their way to Belgium no one knows . <P> Last week a solemn procession wound through the streets of Milan . In a flower-decked automobile rode the heads of the two soldier saints with an honor guard of artillery troops in dress uniforms , and behind them came Milan 's Cardinal Montini . In the church dedicated to the two martyrs , the heads were laid to rest in a glass reliquary with a special Mass.                    @
