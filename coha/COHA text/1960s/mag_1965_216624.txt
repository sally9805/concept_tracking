Except for its saucy rows of opaque lemon awnings , the four-story building next to the Dsseldorf railway station might almost pass for a clinic . Attendants carry stacks of fresh linen through its quiet halls . Its pleasant central dining room keeps hospital hours : breakfast from 8 to 10 , lunch at noon , dinner at 5 . Its 228 tenants , each of whom is examined by city doctors at least twice a week , spend most of their time in bed . <P> <P> But not alone . The $875,000 establishment , built three years ago by an enterprising female real estate speculator , is the biggest , shiniest and most antiseptic example of a modern German variation of organized sex : the hostel of prostitution . <P> Never on Sunday . A hostel , police are quick to point out , is not a house . Houses of prostitution were banned in Germany in 1927 , but prostitution itself is condoned . Absent from the hostel are the pimps and madams of the house . In Dsseldorf 's cupboard of tarts , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as they would in a normal hotel . Moreover , their hostel is a place of immaculate order ; noisy guests are ordered to leave , and drunks are not allowed in . In Stuttgart 's eight-year-old Drei-Farben hostel , business is transacted only from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. - except on Sundays and holidays , when its 71 practitioners knit and watch television . <P> <P> To the connoisseur , the hostel is a sad comedown from Europe 's gilded past , when internationally celebrated bordellos lined their ballrooms with erotic murals and antique chairs , offered their patrons bare-breasted dancing partners as a starter . But wherever they have sprung up , the hostels have done a land-office business . The Dssel-dorf establishment alone handles nearly 8,000 customers a day-at $3.75 apiece - and in Stuttgart , the monthly take is $250,000 . <P> <P> Right to Work . No one appreciates the hostels more than West Germany 's police , who are desperately trying to control the estimated 140,000 prostitutes now pacing the nation 's pavements . Many cities have walled off whole streets of the girls from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frankfurt , bed and board of the late Rosemarie Nitribitt , the cruising floozy of the movie Das Mdchen Rosemarie , downtown traffic is jammed every night by fleets of motorized trollops . They crawl along in their Mercedes flashing their parking lights at prospective clients-then charging them $25 for double parking . When Munich banned them from its downtown area , angry prostitutes formally accused the city council of violating federal right-to-work laws . Then they moved to the suburbs , turning once quiet streets into a nightmare of drunks , procurers and petty crime . <P> Resigned to the perpetuity of the old profession , West German authorities see in the hostels the opportunity they have been waiting for to get whores back , indoors . " The prostitute problem is solved in Dsseldorf , " says the city 's police chief happily , and police in other cities are quietly trying to promote hostels to solve their problems too . It will not be an easy task , for public opinion is often against them . In Cologne , the pastor of powerful St. Ursula 's Roman Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will demand the removal of St. Ursula as the city 's patron saint .
