POWERS A Story by Isaac Bashevis Singer Translated by the author and Dorothea Straus Those who come to our newspaper for advice as a rule do not ask for anyone in particular . We have a journalist whose duty it is to give advice to readers , but this man asked especially for me . He was shown my room and slowly opened the door : a tall man , without a hat , with a shock of black hair mixed with gray . It was snowing outside , but he had on a light raincoat . His square face was red from the cold . He wore no tie , his shirt collar was open , showing a chest covered with hair as thick as fur . His black eyes , under shaggy brows , had a wild look that somewhat frightened me . He had a broad nose and thick lips . When he opened his mouth to talk , he revealed large separated teeth which appeared unusually strong . He had to bend his head to go through the door . He said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am . " He examined me and seemed to be surprised . He said , " Does this little man who sits at this table write all these things ? Yes , it 's you . I recognize you from the picture in the paper , but I imagined you somewhat different . Well , things do n't have to be exactly as we imagine them . I read every word you write , both in Yiddish and in English . When I hear that you have published something in a magazine , I run to buy it even in the middle of the night . " " Thank you very much . Please sit down . " " I 'd rather stand  --  but  --  well  --  I will sit down . May I smoke ? " " Certainly . " " I am not an American . I came here after the second world war . I have gone through Hitler 's hell , Stalin 's hell , and a couple of other hells . But that 's not why I came to you . I came because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me 7 " " Yes , I have time . " " Well , everybody in America is busy . How do you have time to write alI those things and to see people too ? " " There is time for everything . " " What  --  perhaps you are right . Here in America time disappears . Here a week is nothing and a month is nothing , and a year passes by between yes and no . There , with the wicked , a day seemed longer than a year does here . I have been in this country since 1950 and the years have gone like a dream . Now it 's summer , now it 's winter , the years just roll away . How old do you think I am ? " " In the forties , perhaps fifty . " " Add thirteen years more . In April I will be sixty-three . " " You look young  --  knock on wood . " " Everybody says so . In our family we do n't turn gray . My grandfather died at ninety-three and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blacksmith . On my mother 's side , they were scholars . I studied at a Yeshiva . I was a student at the Yeshiva of Gun I also attended a Yeshiva in Lithuania . I studied only until I was seventeen , but I have a good memory . When I learn something it stays stuck in my brain . I forget nothing and this , in a sense , is my tragedy . When I was convinced that poring over the Talmud would be useless , I took to studying worldly books . The Russians had already left and the Germans came . Then Poland became independent and I was drafted into the army . I fought in the Polish-Bolshevist war . I helped to drive the Bolsheviks to Kiev . Then they drove us back to the Vistula . The Poles arc not too fond of Jews , but I advanced , they made me a top sergeant  --  chorazy  --  the highest rank one can reach without having been to military school . After the war , they offered to send me to a military academy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barracks was not my ambition . I read a lot , painted , and tried to become a sculptor . I began to carve all sorts of figures out of wood . I ended up making furniture . I was n't just a carpenter . I specialized in repairing furniture , mostly antiques . You know , furniture gets broken , especially when one moves from one house to another . Inlays fall out , bits break off . It takes skill to make the patch invisible . I still do n't know why I threw myself into this work with so much enthusiasm . Poland is not a rich country , but the gentry have many ancient pieces of furniture which are very dear to them . To find the right grain of wood , the right color , and to fit it in in such a way that even the owner himself could n't spot the place Isaac Bashevis Singer , novelist and journalist , who has written for " The Jewish Daily Forward " since he arrived in New York from Poland in 1935 , is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Manor " will be published by Farrar , Straus &; Giroux , Inc. in October . where it had been broken , for this one needs iron patience and instinct . too . " You still do n't know why I came to you . I am going to tell you . You often write articles about the mysterious powers : telepathy , spirits , hypnotism , fatalism , and what else  --  I read this . I read it because I , myself , possess the powers you describe . I did n't come to boast and I certainly do n't want to become a newspaperman . Here in America I work at my trade and I earn enough . I am single , no wife , no children . They killed my family . I take a drink of whiskey , but I am not a drunkard . I have an apartment here in New York , and a cottage in Woodstock . I do n't need help from anybody . " Yes  --  powers  --  you are right when you say one is born with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carve I was a child of six . Later , I neglected it , but it reawoke . And so it is with the powers . I had them but I did n't know what they were . I got up one morning and it occurred to me that someone in our building would fall out of the window that day . We lived in Warsaw on Twarda Street . I did n't like these thoughts , they frightened me . I left for the Cheder and when I returned the courtyard was black with people . The ambulance was arriving . A glazier was putting a pane in a window on the second floor , and had fallen out . If these things had happened once , twice , or even five times , I could still have called it coincidence , but they happened so frequently that it could not be a question of coincidence . Strange , but I began to understand that I must conceal this , like an ugly birthmark . And I was right , because these powers are a misfortune . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " But no matter how careful you are , you can not hide everything . Once I was sitting in the kitchen , my mother , peace be with her , was knitting a stocking . My father earned well , even though he was a workman . Our apartment was as clean as a rich man 's home . We had a lot of copper dishes and my mother used to scour the pans each week until they shone . I was sitting ? on a low bench . I was n't more than seven years old at the time . Suddenly I said , ' Mommy , under the floor there is money My mother stopped knitting and looked at me in amazement . ' What sort of money ? What are you babbling about ? ' ' Money , ' I said , ' golden coins . ' My mother said , Are you crazy  --  or what ? How do you know what 's under the floor ? " I know , ' I replied . I immediately realized that I should n't have said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When my father came home for dinner , my 78 POWERS mother told him what I had said . I was n't there , but my , father became so astonished that he confessed that he had hidden a number of golden coins under the floor . I had an older sister and my father was saving a dowry for her  --  putting money into a bank was not customary for simple people . When I returned from the Cheder , my father began to question me . ' What 's the matter , are you spying on me ? ' Actually my father had hidden the money when I was in Cheder and my mother was out marketing . My sister had gone to visit a friend . He had locked and bolted the door , and we lived on the third floor . He was even careful enough to stuff the keyhole with cotton . I got a beating , but no matter how I tried , I could not explain to him how I knew it . My father called out , This boy is a devil ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear . It was a lesson to me to keep my mouth shut . " I could tell you a hundred things about my childhood , but I will tell you just one fact . Across the street from our home there was a store that sold dairy products . In those years , you went to the store to buy boiled milk . They boiled it on a gas range . Once my mother gave me a pan and told me , Go to Zelda across the street , and buy a quart of boiled milk . ' I took the pan and went over to Zelda 's dairy store . I came into the store and there was only one customer  --  a girl . She bought a few ounces of butter . In Warsaw they used to slice the butter from a big chunk with a bow , similar to those children carried at the Feast of Omer , when they went picnicking in the Praga forest . I looked up and saw a strange thing : a light burned over Zelda 's head , as if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gaped  --  how is it possible  --  am I crazy or something ? Nearby , at the counter , the girl spoke to Zelda as though nothing were unusual . After Zelda weighed the butter on the scale and the girl had left , Zelda asked me , ' Why do you stand there on the threshold ? I wanted to ask her , ' Why does a light burn ever your head ? ' I already had a hunch that I was the only one who saw it . " The next day , when I came home from Cheder , my mother said to me , ' Did you hear about the misfortune ? Zelda , from the dairy store , suddenly dropped dead . ' You can imagine my fright . I am not sure if I was more than eight years old . I have to tell you that I have seen the same kind of light many times over the heads of those who were about to die . Thank God , I have n't seen that light for the last twenty years . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my days , I would have to see these lights all the time . " Some time ago , you wrote that in each great love there is an element of telepathy . I was struck by this and I then decided that I had to see you . In my own life this happened to me , not once , not ten times , but over and over again . In my young years I was what one calls romantic . I saw a woman and fell in love with her at first sight . In those times you could n't just approach a woman and tell her you were in love with her . Girls were proud . The slightest word was considered an insult . Also , I was , in my own way , shy . It 's not in my nature to chase women . I also have my pride , To make it short , instead of talking to a girl , I began to think about her . I thought about her day and night . I fancied all kinds of impossible encounters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts took effect . I used to think about a girl so long that she actually came to me . Once I waited for a woman until she appeared . It happened on a crowded street in Warsaw . I am not a mathematician , but I know something about figuring out chances . The odds that this woman would have crossed that street at that very time , were about one to twenty million . But she came , as though attracted by an invisible magnet . " I am not too credulous ; even today I have my doubts . We resist believing in the hidden powers . We want to believe that everything happens in a rational way and according to order . We are afraid of mysteries because if there are good powers , there also may be evil ones and who knows what they can do I But so many unusual things happened to me that I would have to be an idiot or a crazy materialist to ignore them . " Perhaps , because I had this kind of magnetism , I never married . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is satisfied with one woman . I had other powers , too , but I am not going to boast about them . In short , I lived , as they say , in a Turkish paradise . There were periods when I had five or six lovers at the same time . In the drawing rooms where I used to fix furniture , I often made the acquaintance of beautiful women  --  mostly Gentiles . And I always heard the same song from them  --  that I was different from other Jews  --  and all that kind of woman 's chatter . I had a room with a separate entrance , and that 's all a bachelor needs . I kept brandy and liquors and all kinds of delicacies in my cupboard . If I should try to tell you what took place in this room , on my sofa , I could make a thick book out of it  --  but who cares ? What is there to boast about ? The older I grew , the clearer it became to me that for modern man , marriage is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurd . Naturally , your mother and my mother were faithful women . For them there was one God and one husband , " Now I come to the main point . It is true that I had many women in those years  --  exactly how many I have n't figured out . But there was one with whom I stayed for almost thirty years  --  actually until the day the Nazis bombed Warsaw . That day thousands of men crossed the bridge to Praga . I wanted to take Manya with meManya was her name  --  but she had the grippe and I could not wait for her . I had thousands of connections in Poland , but in such a catastrophe they are not worth a sniff of tobacco . Later I was told that the house where I lived was hit by a bomb and became a pile of lime and bricks . I never heard from Manya again . " This Manya might have been considered an ordinary girl . She came from some little village in Greater Poland . When we met we were both virgins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could destroy the love between us . She somehow knew of all my abominations and kept warning me that she would leave me. get married . and what not . But she came to me regularly every week and often twice a week . The other women seldom spent the night in my room , but when Manya came , she stayed . She was not particularly beautiful  --  dark , not tall , with black eyes . She had curly hair . In her village they called her Manya the Gypsy . She had all the antics of a gypsy . She told fortunes from cards and read palms . She believed in all kinds of witchcraft and superstitions . She even dressed like a gypsy in flowered skirts and shawls , wore large hoop earrings and red beads around her neck . There was always a cigarette between her lips . She made a living as a salesgirl in a lingerie shop . The owners were an elderly couple without children , and Manya became almost a daughter to them . She was an excellent saleswoman . She could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corsets . She managed the whole business . If she had been willing to steal , she could have amassed a fortune , but she was one hundred per cent honest . Anyhow , the old people were going to leave her the store in their will . In later years , the old man had a liver ailment and his wife , too , was n't very well . So they traveled to Carlsbad , Marienbad , and to Piszczany , where one takes mud baths for arthritis . And they Left everything with Manya . What did she need to get married for ? She needed a man and I was her man . This primitive girl , who could barely read and write , was , in her way , a refined piece of merchandise  --  especially in sex . A story by Isaac Bashevis Singer 83 In my Iife I had , God knows , how many females , but one like Manya never was before and never will be . She had her own caprices and peculiarities and when I think about them I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sadism and masochism is masochism . Are there names for all this nonsense ? Each time we quarreled we were both terribly unhappy and making peace was a great ceremony . She could cook fit for a king . Sometimes she even prepared a meal at my home . I had a gas range . When her bosses went to the spas , she cooked meals for me in their apartment . I used to say that her food had sex appeal , and there was some truth in it . This was her good side . The bad side was that Manya could never make peace with the idea that I had other women . She did everything she could to spoil my pleasure . By nature I am not a liar , but because of her I became a constant one . Or perhaps I could call it an automatic liar . I did not have to invent lies , my tongue did it by itself , and I was often astonished at how clever and farsighted a tongue can be . It foresaw events and situations which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody for thirty years . Manya knew my behavior and she never stopped spying on me . My telephone used to ring in the middle of the night . In spite of all this , my business with other women gave her a perverse enjoyment . From time to time 1 confessed to her and she asked for details , called me the worst names , cried , laughed , and became wild . I often felt like an animal trainer , like one who puts his head in the mouth of a lion . I always knew that my successes with other women made sense only as long as Manya was in the background . If I had Manya , the Countess Potocka was a bargain . Without Manya , all my conquests were not worth a groschen . " It sometimes happened that I returned from one of my adventures , somewhere at an inn or at a nobleman 's estate where I had mended furniture , and I was supposed to he with Manya that night . As a rule , Manya refreshed me and I began all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I grew older , I began to worry that too much love might do me some damage . I am something of a hypochondriac . I read medical books and articles in the newspapers . I began to feel that I was ruining my health . Once , when I returned completely exhausted , and I had to meet Manya , the thought ran through my mind : how good it would he if Manya would get her period and I would not have to spend the night with her . All sorts of strange thoughts run through the mind . I called Manya and she said , ' A strange thing happened , I got my holiday ' ? this is what she called 84 POWERS it ? ' in the middle of the month , ' ' So you are a miracle worker , ' I said to myself . But I remained skeptical about its really having anything to do with my wish . Only after these things repeated themselves many times did I realize that I could give orders to Manya 's body . I have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is a-ready in a higher world . Every word I told you is the pure truth . A few times I ordered her to become sick  --  of course , just for a while , because I loved her very much  --  and she immediately got a high fever . It became clear that I ruled over her body completely . If I wanted her to die , she would have died . I had read books and pamphlets about mesmerism , animal magnetism , and such topics , but it never occurred to me that I possessed this power , and in such measure . " Besides being able to do anything I wanted with her , I also knew her thoughts . I could literally read her mind . Once after a bitter fight , Manya left , slamming the door so hard that the windowpanes trembled . The moment she left , it occurred to me that she was going to the Vistula to drown herself . I grabbed my overcoat and started to follow her silently . She went from one street to another and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never looked back . She did not go directly to the Vistula , but crossed all kinds of side streets and alleys as if she sensed that someone was following her and she was trying to lose him . Finally she reached the Vistula and began to move straight in the direction of the water . I ran after her and grabbed her shoulder . She screamed and struggled . I had saved her from death After that I ordered her never to think of suicide again . Later , she told me . ' How strange , I often used to think of making an end to myself . Lately these thoughts stopped completely . Can you explain this ? ' " I could explain everything . Once when she came to me , I told her , You have lost money today . ' She became pale . It was the truth . She had returned from a savings bank and had lost 600 zlotys. 64T III I will tell you the story about the dog and one episode more and this will be enough . Once , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I was overcome by a terrible fatigue , and I also had , one might say , an attack of hypochrondria . I became entangled in so many affairs and complications that I almost fell apart . My telephone kept on ringing . There were bitter quarrels between Manya and me that began to take on an uncanny character . The old man 's wife  --  whereshe worked  --  had died , and Manya threatened at every opportunity to marry him . She had a cousin in South Africa who wrote her love letters and offered to send her an affidavit . In the midst of our great love , a hatred suddenly arose which literally bordered on murder . She spoke about poisoning herself and me . She proposed a double suicide . A fire kindled in her black eyes , which made her resemble a Tartar . We are all the descendants of God knows what murderers . Did you or someone else write in your newspaper that every man is potentially a Nazi ? At night I usually slept like the dead , but I began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had nightmares . I had always suffered from this , but that summer the nightmares drove me to insanity . One morning I felt that my end had come . My legs became shaky , everything whirled before my eyes , there was a ringing in my ears . I saw that if T did not make some change , I would be finished . I decided to leave everything and go away . I packed a bag . As I packed , the telephone rang madly , but I did not answer it . I went down the street and took a droshky to the Vienna depot . A train was about to leave for Krakow , and I bought a ticket . I sat down on the second-class bench and I was so tired that I slept through the whole trip . The conductor woke me at Krakow . In Krakow I again took a droshky and told the driver to take me to a hotel . The moment I entered the hotel room , I fell down on the bed in my clothes and dozed until dawn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I slept and I did not sleep . I went to the toilet and voices screamed in my ears and bells rang . I literally heard Manya crying and calling me back . I was on the verge of a breakdown . But with my last powers I curbed myself . I had fasted for more than a day and a night , and when I woke at about eleven o'clock in the morning , I was more dead than alive . There are no baths connected with the Krakow hotel rooms . If one wanted a bath , one had to order it from the maid . There was a washstand and a pitcher of water in the room . I somehow managed to shave , eat breakfast , and again went to a railroad station . if I am not mistaken , it was a different one . I rode a few stations , and there the rails ended . Of course I went to the mountains , but it was not the road to Zakopane , but a sideline . I arrived at a village near Babia GOra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a mountain individualist  --  and few tourists come there . There was no hotel or rooming house and I got a room with an old peasant couple , Gazdas , as they are called . I guess you know the region and 1 do n't have to tell you how beautiful it is . But this particular village was especially beautiful and wild . Perhaps because it was so isolated . The old pair had a dog  --  a huge specimen -- I do n't know what breed ; I am not a specialist in dogs . They warned me that he would bite and one should be careful with him . I patted him on the head , I tickled his neck , and he immediately became my pal . That 's an understatement  --  the dog fell madly in love with me  --  and it happened almost at once . He did not leave me for a minute . The old couple rented the room every summer , but the dog never became attached to any lodger . To make it short , I ran away from human love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a woman , even though he belonged to the male sex . He made scenes of jealousy that were worse than Manya 's . I took long walks and he ran after me everywhere . At night he insisted upon sleeping on my bed . In these places , dogs have fleas . I tried not to let him into my room , but he howled and wailed so terribly that he woke half the village . I had to let him in my room and he immediately jumped on the bed . There were whole A story by Isaac Bashevis Singer 85 orders to mend furniture and the owners kept phoning me . A few days passed  --  or perhaps a few weeks  --  I do n't remember exactly . After a difficult day , I went to sleep at night . I put out the lamp . I was so exhausted that I fell asleep immediately . Suddenly I woke up . Waking up in the middle of the night was not unusual for me , but this time I woke with the feeling that someone was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaviness in my chest , but this time I felt an actual weight on my feet . I looked up and a dog was lying on my blanket . The lamp was out , but it was n't completely dark because a street lamp shone in . I recognized Burek . " At first I had the idea that the dog had run after the train to Warsaw . But this was sheer nonsense . In the first place , he was tied up ; then , no dog can run for so long after an express train . Even if the dog could have found his way to Warsaw by himself  --  and found my house  --  he could not have climbed up three flights of stairs  --  besides , my door was always locked . I grasped that this was not a real dog , flesh and blood , it packs of dogs in the village and if I only looked at another dog , Burek became wild . He bit them , and me too . He cried with a human voice . They began to say in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stay long , because one could die there from boredom . I had taken a few books with me , but I had read them all . I had rested and was ready for new entanglements . But parting from Burek was not an easy business . He had sensed , with God knows what instinct , that I was about to leave . I had telephoned Manya from the post office and had received telegrams and registered letters in that Godforsaken village . The dog kept on barking and howling . The last day , Burek went into some kind of spasm ; he foamed at the mouth . The peasants were afraid he was mad . Until then , he had n't even been tied up , but his owner got a chain and tied him to a stake . His clamor and his tearing at the chain shattered my nerves . " I returned to Warsaw , sunburned , but not really rested . What the dog did to me in that village , Manya , and a few other females , did in Warsaw . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a phantom  --  or what would you call it ? I saw his eyes , 1 felt the heaviness on my feet , but I did n't dare to touch him . 1 sat there terrified , and he looked me in the eyes with an expression both utterly sad  --  and something else  --  for which I have no name . I had the desire to push him off and free my feet , but something restrained me . This was not a dog , but a ghost . I lay down again and tried to fall asleep . After a while I succeeded . A nightmare ? ? call it a nightmare . But it was Burek just the same . I recognized his eyes , ears , his expression , his fur . The next day I wanted to write to the peasant to ask about the dog . But I knew that the peasant could not read and I was also too busy to write letters . Most probably , I would n't have gotten an answer anyhow , I am completely convinced that the dog had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this world . " I want to assure you that it happened not once , but many times over a number of years , so that I had ample time to observe my visitor even though he never appeared in the light . The dog was old , and the way he looked that last day , when 86 POWERS I left the village , 1 knew that he could not have lasted long . I later heard that there is such a thing as an astral body . What difference what it is called ? ? you can call it spirit , soul  --  whatever you like  --  it is a fact , at least for me , that a ghost of a dog came to me and lay on my legs  --  nut once , but a dozen times . In the beginning it happened quite frequently  --  almost every night  --  then it happened more rarely A dream ? ? no  --  I was n't dreaming , unless the whole of life is one dream .

This plain man who sits here with you has made love to Polish countesses . What is a countess ? We are all made of the same stuff . But once I met a young woman who really made me jump out of my skin . I was hired to come to a noblewoman 's house in Wilanow , where 1 had to mend an old pianoforte , decorated with gilded garlands . Suddenly , a young woman passed by . She glided through the drawing room . She stopped for a single second , saw what I was doing , and our eyes met . How can I describe to you how she looked 7 ? both Polish aristocrat , and strangely Jewish  --  as if by some magic , a gentle Yeshiva student had turned into a Polish panienka . She had a narrow face and black eyes , such deep ones that I became confused . They actually burned me . Everything about this woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such beauty . She disappeared in an instant , and I remained shattered . Later , I asked the owner who that beauty was , and she said it was a niece who was visiting . She mentioned the name of some estate or town from which she came . But in my confusion , I did n't pay any attention . I could easily have learned her name and address if I had n't been so dazed . I finished my work , but she never showed up again . I had plenty of headaches without that gentlewoman . But the brain will not always listen to hard facts . I began to think about her day and night without stopping . My thoughts wore me out and I decided to make an end of them , no matter what the cost . But her image always stood before my eyes . Manya realized that I was n't myself and this was the reason for new scenes .

I said hello , and no one answered . However , somebody was holding the receiver at the end of the line . I called again , ' hello , hello , hello , ' and I heard a crackle and a stammering voice . I said , ' Whoever you are , be so good as to speak up clearly . ' " After a while I heard a voice which immediately impressed me . It was a woman 's voice , but also that of a boy . To make it short , it was this woman . She said to me , You once worked in Wilanow , in such and such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the drawing room ? ' My throat became tight , and for a while I lost my tongue . ' Yes , I remember you , ' I said . ' Can one forget your face ? ' She became quiet and I thought she had hung up . But she began to talk again . Actually , she murmured . She said , ' I have to talk to you . Where can we meet ? ' ' I will meet you wherever you wish , ' I replied ; perhaps you would want to come to me . ' ' No , out of the question , ' she said . ' Perhaps in a caf ? ' No , not in a cafe . ' ' Tell me where you could meet me and I will be there . ' She became silent ; then she mentioned a little street near the city library , way up town , near Mokutow . ' When do you want it to be ?

' I knew that there was no caf ? , no restaurant , not even a bench to sit on in that little street , but I told her that I was leaving at once . There had been a time when I had thought that if this miracle would happen and I would make contact with this woman , I would jump for joy . But somehow everything was silent in me . I was neither happy nor unhappy  --  only amazed at what powers we possess . When I arrived there , it was already night . The street had many trees on both sides and a few lamps . I entered the street and saw her in the half darkness . She seemed leaner and her hair was combed up in a bun . She stood near a tree and was wrapped in shadow . Except for her , the street was deserted . I approached her and she started . The trees were blooming and the gutter was full of blossoms . I said to her , ' Here I am . Where can we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' she replied , ' can be said right here . ' ' What do you want to tell me ? ' I asked . And she hesitated , ' I want to ask you , ' she said , ' to leave me in peace . ' " I was startled , and said , ' I do n't know what you mean . ' ' You know very well , ' she said . ' You do n't leave me in peace . I have a husband and I am happy with him . I want to be a faithful wife . ' It was n't talking , but stammering . She paused after each word . She said , ' It was n't easy to learn who you were and your telephone number . I had to invent a story about a broken chest to get information from my aunt . I am not a liar , but my aunt did not believe me . But after a while she gave me your name and address . How much this cost me , you will never know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Why ca n't we go somewhere to talk it oyer ? " I ca n't go anywhere . I could have told you this on the telephone  --  it is all so strange , absolutely insane  --  but you know the truth . ' ' I really do n't know what 's on your mind , ' I said , just to prolong the conversation . She said , ' I beseech you , by whatever is holy to you , to stop torturing me . What you want , I can not do  --  I 'd rather die . ' " And her face became as pale as chalk . I still played the fool and said . ' I want nothing from you . It is true that when I saw you in your aunt 's drawing room , you made a strong impression on me  --  but I have n't done anything to upset you . ' ' Yes , you have . If we were n't living in the twentieth century , I would think you were a sorcerer . Believe me , ' she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decision to call you . I was even afraid that you would n't know who I was  --  but you knew immediately . ' " ' We can not stand here on the street and talk , ' I said . ' We have to go somewhere . ' ' Where ? If someone who knows me should see me , I am lost . ' I said , ' Come with me . ' She hesitated for a while , and then she followed me . She seemed to have difficulty in walking on her high heels and she took my arm . I noticed , even though she was wearing gloves , that she had most beautiful hands . Her hand fluttered on my arm , and each time , a shudder ran through my body . After a while , the young woman became more relaxed with me , and she said , ' What kind of powers do you possess ? I have heard your voice several times . I have seen you , too . I woke up in the middle of the night and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead of eyes , two green beams shone from your sockets . I woke my husband , but in a second you vanished . ' " ' It 's a hallucination , ' I said . ' No , you wander in the night . ' ' If I do , it 's without my knowledge . ' " We approached the shore of the Vistula and sat down on a log . It 's quiet there . It 's not com-pletely safe because it 's full of drunks and bums . But she sat with me . She said , ' My aunt will not know what has become of me . I told her that 1 walk . She even offered to ac-A story by Isaac Bashevis Singer 87 company me . Give me a holy promise that you will let me go . Perhaps you have a wife and you would n't want anybody to molest her . ' " ' I have no wife , ' I said , ' but I promise you that , as far as it depends on me , I will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " ' I will be grateful to you until my last breath . ' " That is the story . I never saw the woman again . I do n't even know her name . I do n't know why , but of all the unusual things that have happened to me , this event made the strongest impression on me . Well , I wo n't disturb you anymore . " " You do n't disturb me . It 's good to meet a person with such powers . It strengthens my own faith . But how did it happen that Manya had the grippe when you left Warsaw ? Why did n't you order her to get well ? " " What ? -1 ask myself this question constantly . It seems that my power is only negative . To heal the sick , one must be a saint , and , as you see , I am far from being a saint  --  or , who knows  --  to have a woman along in those days was dangerous .

He gave me his hand to say goodbye , and I accompanied him to the elevator . " Do you still think about women ? " I asked . He thought it over as though he had n't grasped my words . He looked at me sadly , askance , with suspicion . " Only about dead women . " Harper'a Illagaziate , October 1967
