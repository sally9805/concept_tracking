They roll 'd from place to place , around the bless 'd abodes <P> Self-moved , obedient to the beck of gods . <P> - Iliad <P> Homer thus described the 20 threewheeled chariots built in a single day by the Greek god of fire , Hephaestus , the master craftsman who dwelt on Mount Olympus . Though ordinary Greek chariots lacked the gift of self-propulsion , the Greeks once led the ancient world in the production of wheeled vehicles . For the past several millennia , however , the Greek vehicle industry has been in quite a slump . In modern times , while such smaller nations as Portugal and Israel have managed to produce autos of their own , Greece has had no automotive industry . <P> Last week six brothers named Kondogouris moved to emulate Hephaestus and restore the vehicular glory that once was Greece 's . Their family-owned National Motor Co. of Athens selected a site in the port city of Patras , where it will build a factory in September , hire nearly 1,000 workers and begin production before year 's end of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Fiat . Their initial production goal : Hephaestus ' 20 vehicles a day . So many foreign orders have already been received that the Kondogouris brothers have earmarked the 6,000 vehicles they will produce in 1966 for export to Common Market countries ; they hope to raise production to 15,000 in 1967 , begin selling in Greece . If they succeed , the brothers will provide an important economic lift for Greece , which has an annual trade deficit of $530 million : the value of Pully exports in 1966 should equal the exports of Greece 's entire metal-manufacturing industry . Says Victor Kondogouris , 34 , National 's assistant managing director : " We aspire to make our Pully business the backbone of Greece 's export trade . " <P> The sons of a well-off former mayor of Salonika , the Kondogouris brothers invested $400,000 in 1961 to build <P> Greece 's first automotive factory , began assembling a German-licensed farm truck . In 1963 they sold their Salonika plant to Chrysler International for $1,800,000 , a deal that gave them enough to start their $2,000,000 Pully venture without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a two-cylinder Fiat engine , weighs 1,100 Ibs. , costs less than $1,000 and will-according to National- " motorize the masses . " Once the Pully gets going , the company will start work on a small passenger line - which , because the Greeks do not quite have a word for it , Victor Kondogouris calls " a Greek Volkswagen .
