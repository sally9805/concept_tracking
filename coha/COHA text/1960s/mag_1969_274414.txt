The San Francisco Examiner placed an editorial above its front-page logo , framed it with a red , white and blue border , and said : THE PROTEST MOVEMENT HELPS HANOI . The Birmingham News used a full page of color for the Stars and Stripes itself , topped by a Nixon quote : " Our road is not easy , not simple . . . but right . " In its editorial space , the New York Post ran an obituary notice for the Viet Nam dead above 10 inches of white space . <P> Moratorium Day provoked other predictable comment . Columnist Morrie Ryskind of the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner called Oct. 15 " Black Wednesday . " At the other extreme , Nicholas von Hoffman referred to Nixon in the Washington Post as " what's-his-face , the furtive and fugitive President who darts from TV station to armed compound . " In between , there was considerable editorial reaction that was not quite so obvious . Some newspapers favoring Nixon 's Viet Nam policy , like the Los Angeles Times , showed the protesters a measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concluded that M-day had probably encouraged the enemy but added that it had also " served as a national safety valve for the venting of frustrations , legitimate and otherwise . " Liberal Columnist Max Lerner was disappointed that the protesters were long on enthusiasm but short on policy . Many were impressed with the peaceful nature of the protest . Even the right-wing <P> New York Daily News conceded the day after M-day that an " unknown number of sincere and entirely well-meaning persons " had taken part in what it earlier had termed a " treacherous nationwide jamboree . " <P> Perhaps the most remarkable press reaction to M-day came not from the editorial writers and columnists , but from rank-and-file newsmen . In large numbers , they broke with tradition and became active participants in a controversial news event . Thousands across the nation signed petitions , attended rallies and wore Moratorium buttons . Many took off the buttons when they went on assignments , but not all . Some television newsmen continued to wear black arm bands as they covered the giant public rally on Boston Common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as " Wall Street Journalists , " joined in a march in New York 's financial district . More than 100 staff members of the San Francisco Chronicle sent Nixon a petition urging an immediate halt to the war ; several of them also picketed the Examiner office next door to protest its pro-Nixon editorial . <P> Problem of Bias . Not all the nation 's newsmen favored the protesters . In Houston , a reporter for radio station KILT refused to cover a demonstration in Hermann Park , declaring : " You can fire me if you want to , but I 'm not going out there to talk to those jackasses . " He was n't fired , but dovish Floyd Knox , city editor of the Waterbury ( Conn . ) Republican was . Knox , who admits to having had other disputes with the paper 's management , decided on his own to mark M-day with a front-page list of the Waterbury-area war casualties . He was dismissed the day it ran .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
