txt As President Johnson and his closest advisers prepare for another major review of the war in Vietnam , concern is mounting among officials below them that the United States and Communist China are headed for a collision that neither wants . Sonic sub-Cabinet officials and senior analysts have warned : that if the pattern of steppedup warfare continues in Vietnam . the two nations may be within months of a direct clash. ! Analysts are warning not ! only of direct intervention but ! also of diversionary actions ini Laos or even India . President Johnson , Secretary of Defense Robert S. mara and Secretary of State ! Dean Rusk have been concen-1 trating on the intentions and ca-1 pacifies of North Vietnam . ! In the aftermath of Mr. Mc- . Namara 's latest trip to Saigon.1 they are dealing with several , grave questions , including the following : Has Hanoi decided to commit its regular army to the war ! in South Vietnam , perhaps at ! the rate of a regiment a month ? fill Washington 's plans to ! // pulverize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be enough to offset the Communist move ? cWill North Vietnam go so far as to commit the bulk of its 300,000-man army in reply , and does it have Peking 's support for so large a war ? Other officials are b urginc , that even more difficult questions , about China , be considered at the same time . They point to intelligence information and analyses that link the problems of widened warfare with the chances of miscalculation , in Washington as well as in Peking . A basic assumption here for some time has been that Communist China would not wish to risk bombardment by the United States by intervening in the war . Washington has warned China that there would not be immune " sanctuaries " on its territory , as there were during the Korean war . But officials are commenting that China 's best interests may not appear the same to Peking as to Washington and that it is hard to tell when Peking may , feel comnelled to respond to the intensifying military measures near its frontiers . Some of the evidence underlying their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Much of it , in any case , is described as still ambiguous . Officials say , for example , that they do not yet know how to read the reports of a great new Chinese commitment of material aid to North Vietnam . Hanoi is said to be complaining about the amount and asking for more . Complaints Are Weighed The Administration has been described as unable to determine whether the complaints represent a procedural quarrel growing out of a fixed plan by the two Governments to step up the war or whether it indicates a continuing Chinese reluctance to become too deeply committed . The number of Chinese troops , ) combat engineers and tech. ! nicians serving in North Viet-1 nam is also said to be unclear . Some of the Chinese appear to : be military advisers : some are ' logistic experts building supply depots along the rail line that ' links Hanoi with two parts of ! southern China . Thus far Washington is said . to be in doubt about whether , the Chinese are in North Viet-1 nam to improve the flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have to employ if they enter the war , or for both purposes . For some time there have , been reports of urgent prepar- , ations at Chinese airfields near ! Vietnam and of civil-defense : alerts in Chinese cities . But . argument continues about whether these are precautions Or hints that the Chinese ex- : pent to become involved . Intelligence officials recall that their predecessors failed to . predict the North Korean in- : vasion of South Korea and the intervention of the Chinese Communists in that war in I950 not because they misjudged the ; enemy 's capability but because , they misunderstood his intenH tions . China 's Motives Weighed Much discussion here , therefore . turns on Peking 's state of mind . Last year Chinese leaders were suggestin .. that their troops would fight only if attacked , and as recently as Sep- ' , tember . Foreign Minister Chen ' Yi said his hair had turned vhite while he waited for the Americans to attack . For most of the summer . Peking 's pronouncements ? seemed cautious , leaving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight alone , with only material aid from outside , until the United States was exhausted . But in March Foreign Minister Chen warned that China would " intervene beyond any , doubt " if the existence of North Vietnam were threatened. ; In April , China described itself ! and Vietnam as " interdepen- , dent as man 's lips and teeth . " and as comrades in arms " sharing the same destiny . " Peking alerted its " people 's organizations " to " make full preparations to send their own people to fight together with the Vietnamese people and drive out the united States aggressors in the event that United States imperialism continues to escalate its war of aggres- , sion and the Vietnamese people need them . " Moreover , Peking assumed the responsibility of goading North ' , Vietnam to fight on and to ab- , 1 sorb the American air attacks , ' predicting that the combined available Communist forces would always greatly outnumber those of the United States . Angrily , Peking fought off Soviet and non-Communist proposals for a compromise . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrate the martyrdom of a young soldier who had given his life to save 12 militiamen from a dynamite explosion . Pledges were gathered from millions in all China for the " emulation " of such sacrifices . This week seven major Chinese newspapers published a long dissertion on bayonet fighting by another young soldier . The first section , titled " Defeat Atomic Bombs With Bayonets , " scoffed at those who discount man 's ability to fight missiles . It said that by charging an enemy and " intermingling " with him , " any atomic bombs he might drop would destroy him also . " In view of all this and in view of an apparent determination in Washington to continue to step up the war , analysts are urging the policy-makers to consider how deeply engaged the Chinese may have become and what promissory notes the North Vietnamese will try to collect in Peking . Washington 's immediate plans appear to call for a rapid buildup of American forces in Vietnam from the present level  - -  165,000  --  toward 250.000 , and 300,000 is the number most often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to intensify the bombing and strafing of supply routes from North Vietnam to South Vietnam , the most important of which run through Laos . The bombing of North Vietnam itself is said to have become so widespread that Hanoi and its port , Haiphong  --  the major population and industrial centers  --  are left as mere " islands . " Attacks upon the two cities have apparently not been decided upon , but they are no longer ruled out either . One informed official said he would " not . now buy real estate " in Hanoi . The North Vietnamese , in : turn , are believed to have de- ; cided to commit at least some ! additional fighting pits . Sec-1 retary 's forecast of ! an infiltration rate of 4,5001 North Vietnamese troops a month  --  compared with 1,5001 this summer and 800 a year ago ? is described as a projection , not yet verified but not " unreasonable . " The purpose of pointing to a ' , possible increase in infiltration , officials say , is not to justify ! the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to set the stage for further step-ups in the , months ahead .
