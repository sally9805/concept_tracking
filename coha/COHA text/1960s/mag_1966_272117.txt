Only three months ago , Ludwig Erhard was firmly maintaining that if Charles de Gaulle insisted on pulling his troops out of the unified NATO command , he could hardly keep 72,000 of them on German soil , no matter how much he wanted to keep a watch on the Rhine . " There can be no throwback to an occupation status , " Erhard declared . Then , as De Gaulle 's July 1 deadline for France 's NATO withdrawal began to creep nearer , Erhard allowed technical experts in Paris to negotiate a " temporary " agreement under which the French troops might stay in Germany for the time being . Last week , as De Gaulle called in Bonn for a ten-hour visit under the terms of the 1963 Franco-German agreement ( which requires biannual meetings of the two heads of government ) , it became clear that the temporary arrangement would probably become a permanent one . <P> From the moment De Gaulle arrived , everything pointed to success for the visitor from Paris . What with his defeat at the North Rhine-Westphalia polls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " wing of his party , Erhard presumably felt it was no time to give his enemies grounds for charging him with gumming up relations with France . In any case , he gave De Gaulle a reception that was far beyond what protocol requires for an ordinary working visit . Honor guards and anthems were in profusion , and Erhard 's luncheon toast was especially cordial . <P> No one at the table was tactless enough to suggest that le gnral had scored another tactical victory . Instead , the story was that De Gaulle had made a " concession " to Erhard by telling him that West Germany did have a right to request France to withdraw its troops , since France had clearly abrogated the 1954 NATO agreement that allowed them to stay in the first place . Erhard replied to this face-saving gesture by informing De Gaulle that West Germany would be delighted to have the French troops remain , and he " hoped and expected " that some sort of agreement would be worked out in the next six months . In a way , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German soil offer proof to the world that West Germany has no militarist ambitions of her own .
