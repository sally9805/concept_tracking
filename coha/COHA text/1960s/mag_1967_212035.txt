In the fight against urban slums , one huge reservoir of money and talent-the business community-has been largely overlooked . Now , with a powerful economy mood in Washington blocking any large new federal programs , urban spokesmen , both in Congress and the Johnson Administration , are looking for ways to lure private industry into the ghettos . Business , in turn , seems to be awakening to its opportunities as well as its responsibilities in the cities . Last week , as proof , the nation 's life insurance industry pledged to invest $1 billion in the slums . <P> Initially , most of the money would go into housing , one of the most acute needs . Later , funds would also be channeled into new job-producing industries and businesses . Though new safeguards from the Federal Housing Administration would minimize the risks that have hitherto frightened most businessmen away , profits , in the current tight-money market , would unquestionably be lower than they would be from comparable investments elsewhere . Still , as one executive frankly noted , the $1 billion is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We do business with 125 million people in life insurance , " he said . " We are interested in anything which will promote the health , wealth and income of the nation . " " We want to record ourselves , " added Gilbert Fitzhugh , chairman of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. and head of the industry committee that formulated the plan , " as sharing in the determination to find ways to improve the quality of life in the cities . " As part of that recording , Metropolitan and Prudential , the two giants of the field , each promised $200 million . <P> The insurance companies had been closeted with Administration officials for weeks devising the project and President Johnson , who has shied away from any new federal projects in response to the summer riots , praised it as if it were his own , * jubilantly bringing a host of business and municipal leaders to the White House for the announcement . " What the Government does , " he told the gathering , " really is only the beginning . Private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success . " <P> Johnson had more than one reason for praise . The insurance companies ' pledge may be the crucial factor in keeping alive his cherished rent-supplement program , which has been killed by the House of Representatives but approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee . Since much of the $1 billion would finance apartments for tenants supported by the rent supplements , it represents tangible evidence for conservative Congressmen that business not only supports the program , but will also provide more than enough private financing to get it under way . Given the need , even $1 billion is not a large sum , but as a breakthrough in bringing private enterprise into an area it has traditionally shunned , it may have an importance beyond all accounting . <P>
