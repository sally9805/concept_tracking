One of the most successful examples of student protest has made its point without a single sit-in . It all began last January when Arthur Present , a Civil Aeronautics Board examiner , recommended that the CAB end the airlines ' " youth fares , " which allow passengers from twelve to 22 to fly for half fare on a standby basis or for two-thirds fare with a reserved seat . Prodded partly by ailing intercity bus lines , Present found the discount fares " unjustly discriminatory . " He did not reckon with the power of American students when they feel it is they who have suffered the discrimination . <P> More for Less . A group called Half-Fair was founded by three Princeton students , Bradley Olsen , 20 , Jeffrey Stahl , 21 , and Mark Smith , 19 . They drafted model petitions and form letters to Congressmen , and sent them out to 120 student newspapers in all 50 states . Simultaneously , at the University of Denver , Sophomore David Shapin , 19 , organized 200 of his fellow students and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bitter editorials began appearing in the campus press , and letters by the thousands rained on Congressmen and airline executives . Both the National Student Association and the Campus Americans for Democratic Action , the student arm of the liberal political organization , sent delegates to carry their protest to the CAB . Parents , who like to see more of their offspring for less money , also joined the campaign . <P> The airlines generally support the students and the cut-rate fares , in the belief that they encourage flying by people who would otherwise take a train or bus , or not travel at all . Last year , more than 5,000,000 young passengers used the fares at a savings of $112 million to them . Even so , the industry has earned a $21 million profit on youth fares during the past two years . <P> Responding to the protest , 40 Senators are now co-sponsoring a bill that would extend youth fares even if the CAB votes to discontinue them . A similar bill has been introduced in the House , but the chances are that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breadth and sincerity of the student protest , the CAB will probably overrule its examiner sometime soon and let the youngsters continue to fly high at half price .
