txt WASHINGTON , Oct. ** surmount the Berlin crisis successfully the President must manage a triple play and , in dealing with Mr. Gromyko today , he was dealing with but one of three major elements in the problem . For Mr. Kennedy faces three negotiations , not just one . As adversary , of course , Russia is the major element . But the President must also come to terms with our allies and with the American public . No Berlin formula will really work unless it is accepted by Russia , approved by our country as a whole and endorsed by our allies , mainly West Germany , Britain and France . For some weeks Mr. Khrushchev has toned down his public statements and has begun to acknowledge that the issue transcends Berlin in its implications and that immensely important prestige aspects are involved . Immediate pressure has been reduced . Moscow seems aware of the danger of letting the situation escape control . Nevertheless , peril is still real and the shadow of potential holocaust perceptible . Because Mr. Khrushchev now sees our determination on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bluff , he is attempting a new kind of pressure . This is an open warning to Britain , France and Italy that they are his " hostages . " Mr. Khrushchev knows his ' nuclear-missile batteries are still unable to really destroy the United States . These batteries are simply not yet long and accurate enough and our own capacity for riposte is far too strong . Nevertheless , Russia could pulverize Europe today . By underscoring this unhappy fact , Mr. Khrushchev hopes to weaken the resolve of our overseas partners . We must negotiate agreement with the other NATO members on each step as well as on ultimate East-West decisions . There is bound to be a Western foreign ministers meeting before a final diplomatic showdown with Russia  --  although the likelihood of a Western Summit appears to be fading . Attitudes of Allies And as discussions edge closer to the decisive phase we must reckon with the attitudes of individual allies based on their own national interests and concepts . Aware that the voluntary and democratically based NATO coali-1 ion faces these internal negotiating problems , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal negotiation more difficult . He himself has no problem vis-a-vis Russia 's allies . They have no ultimate vote , but he knows that our allies do . Mr. Khrushchev has no serious problem with Soviet public opinion . The Russian people may not like the thought of war games , much , less war , but they have inadequate ways of expressing this opinion . Nor is any choice offered to the satellite populations . However , we do have a public opinion to be reckonedwith . American public opinion has plainly indicated that it is ready to follow the nation 's leader to the brink of war and , if need be , right to war itself . The difficult thing is to guide this opinion along the intricate , tortuous path in search of settlement . It must be kept resolute ; and simultaneously it must be guarded against miscast hopes and deceptions . The President 's role is consequently multiple . He must convince the Russians we will give nothing essential away and are calmly if sadly resigned to the alternative of holocaust if they insist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the Russians overplay their hand we will come to their instant aid  --  above all if Mr. Khrushchev tries to apply his dreadful " hostage " concept by bombarding them with thermonuclear weapons . Finally , he must convince the American people that peace with honor is possible without either real or moral sacrifice ; but that until this is secured they must remain coolly poised upon disaster 's brink . Mr. Kennedy 's triple task is vastly more intricate than Mr. Khrushchev 's single-minded aggressiveness . But if the President succeeds in these intertwined maneuvers , his triumph will be singularly impressive . For such a triumph , while shaped by the West 's most powerful statesman , would be founded on mass support granted after serious consultation and much soulsearching . Sanity commends that . the Berlin crisis be resolved by diplomacy . But in choosing this sane approach Mr. Kennedy is aware that his problem is thrice that of Mr. Khrushchev . For he must win three negotiations and win them simultaneously .               @ @ @ @ @ @
