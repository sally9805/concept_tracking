The Volkswagen may be the most practical invention since the zipper . It goes almost everywhere , and it does almost anything . It never touches a drop of water , and sips gasoline daintily , as if through a straw . It is a durable first car , a dependable second car , a disposable station car , a playpen for the kids , and a kennel for the family dog . Now the Volkswagen has a new , bolder occupation : it is off to the race track-squealing brakes , crashing gears , smoking tires and all . <P> To sports-car buffs with pinched pockets and Mittyesque visions of checkered flags , Volkswagen racing is serious business . Grand Prix cars are strictly for pros , Ferraris are for millionaires , and Corvettes are for finance companies . The Formula Junior was supposed to be every man 's racer-a pint-sized Grand Prix car that offered most of the thrills for a fraction of the cost . But prices quickly shot up to $7,000 or more . <P> Stripe Down the Hood . At least , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anybody who has a spare Beetle lying around the garage can turn it into a reasonable facsimile of a Grand Prix car-cigar-shaped body , roll bar and all-by buying a kit for $945 . An extra $1,000 buys a brand-new Volkswagen engine , plus a special gearbox , rear axle and suspension-and $2,495 buys the whole 825-lb. bomb from the factory . The family sedan can even be raced as is : just painting a stripe down the hood or a number on the door is enough to transform it into a " touring class " racing machine . <P> It is all a gas-even for an old pro like Dan Gurney , who has raced everything from putt-putting go-karts to the snorting monsters of Indianapolis . " You ca n't get confused , " says Gurney . " You can even yell at the other drivers . " At the Bahamas Speed Weeks , while martini glasses tinkled and bountiful blondes chased their heroes through the pits , Gurney took the wheel of a bright orange Volkswagen and challenged all comers in a 103-mile race . His car was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was , in fact , his personal car in Nassau-and his wife fretted nervously while inspectors stripped it apart to make sure that no slick mechanic had installed a Cadillac engine . " I hope they can get it back together , " she said . " This is our transportation . " <P> Open Door . The race was run strictly according to the book . There was a Le Mans-type running start for the 17 sedan drivers , and the 18 Formula Vees had to give the sedans a one-minute head start . The speeds were low- " Sometimes I can get up to about 70 m.p.h. , " confided one racer , " if the wind is n't too bad " - and so were the risks . But the racket was realistic : " Why it sounds just like a race , " mused a spectator . <P> Even in a Volkswagen , class tells . Gurney was all the way into the first corner before he shut the door of his sedan . Only once each lap-on a particularly tricky corner-did he bother to touch his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was flat out . " You 've got to keep the revs up there and use them , " he explained . The pace was enough to discourage all but the stoutest-hearted competitors . " I tried to run his kind of race , " said one , " but I did n't have the nerve . " At the finish , Gurney was a full minute ahead of the nearest sedan . His average speed : 65 m.p.h.
