In the pale sun of a late afternoon , a carriage of Sweden 's royal household came to a stop before a weathered granite tombstone inscribed HJALMAR HAMMARSKJOLD FAMILY GRAVE . Six pallbearers in tall top hats and long black coats lifted down a mahogany casket , lowered it silently into an open grave . An eddy of wind blew a few leaves into the grave . " Sleep you now in the garden of heaven , " said Lutheran Archbishop Gunnar Hultgren . " Rest in peace , Dag Hammarskjold . " <P> Thus Dag Hammarskjold was buried , with ceremony usually accorded to Swedish kings , at Uppsala , the city where he grew up and studied . It had been a long way home : 5,000 miles from Ndola. the small Rhodesian town where the Secretary-General had been bound to negotiate peace in Katanga . When the body arrived in Stockholm aboard an American DC-yC , 250,000 mourners gathered for a torchlight procession . At Uppsala the closed casket , nearly buried in flowers , was placed in the 13th century Lutheran cathedral , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funeral ended , church bells tolled from Malmo to Malmberget ; then everything in Sweden stopped abruptly for a moment of silence . Among the 2,000 invited guests was the Ambassador of Russia , which in the last year of his life had denounced Hammarskjold as " a bloody-handed lackey of the colonial powers . " President Kennedy sent Lyndon Johnson , U.N . Ambassador Adlai Stevenson . Said Johnson : " The name of Dag Hammarskjold has entered history-and history confers its highest honors for heroes of peace .

" <P> Sweden 's 81-year-old Archbishop Emeritus Erling Eidem , who buried Hammarskjold 's statesman father eight years ago , conducted the service with quavering hand . Opera Singer Elisabeth Soderstrom sang I Know That My Redeemer Liveth , and the Lutheran choir Work , for the Night Is Coming .
