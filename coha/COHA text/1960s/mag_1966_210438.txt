PROMETHEUS : THE LIFE OF BALZAC by AndrMaurois. 573 pages . Harper &; Row . $10 . <P> Honor de Balzac did not look or act like a writer , and the literary assessors of his time declined to treat him as one . He was short , fat , gap-toothed , messy , and , according to one contemporary , had " the face of a pantler , the general look of a cobbler , the girth of a barrelmaker , the manners of a hatter . " Estimates of his work were hardly more flattering : Sainte-Beuve dismissed his style as " prolix and formless , slack . " The author of La Comdie Humaine , that panorama of post-revolutionary France , died up to his chins in debt to his mother , wife , sister , mistress , gardener and the village constable in Ville-d'Avray . Now the world stands heavily in Balzac 's debt , and in the 115 years since his death , dozens of doting biographies have tried to even the account . <P> This book , though at times tedious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Andr Maurois , an old hand at literary biographies ( Shelley , Byron , Dickens , Dumas , Hugo , Proust ) , disavows that intention . " This is a life of Balzac , not a critical study , " he says in a foreword and , having passed his 80th year , announces that it is the last biography he will write . Nevertheless , Prometheus is strewn with the kind of judgments that a disciple makes at the feet of the master : " A super-novelist , " " the greatest novelist of the century . " Balzac 's very faults become virtues : " The enforced disorder " of his life " reproduces the disorder of life " itself . <P> Critics have repeatedly noted that Balzac 's life would have made an excellent Balzac plot . So it would . And so , to a considerable degree , it did . Like many others before him , Maurois reckons up the bill that Balzac 's output-97 novels and novellas , scores of stories , articles and plays , 6,000,000 words-owes to the author 's experiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep in France 's soil , Balzac never really escaped his origins . Of life he demanded money , love and magic - the themes of all his books-and spent them faster than they came in . He dreamed of the $100,000 pineapple crop he would harvest from the slope of his modest villa in Ville-d'Avray , of fortunes in old Roman silver to be found in Sardinia-meanwhile hiding from creditors in the home of one of his married mistresses . <P> But the visionary also chained himself to his work table for nights on end , compulsively churning out that prodigious torrent of words that is his own monument and literature 's as well . Old Goriot , Lost Illusions , Louis Lambert , Droll Stories , Eugnie Grandet-these and other components of Comdie , his grand design , enjoy a special favor on the shelf of classics that not many others there can claim : they can be read today just for pleasure , by nonscholars , without respect to their literary pedigree .                 @ @ @ @
