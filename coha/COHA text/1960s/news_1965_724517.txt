txt Washington The Republican Party is briskly picking itself up off the ground . It rejects the verdict of some that its future is behind it . GOP leaders al e looking back at the havoc of last fall  --  and are starting to apply the lessons . They are looking ahead to 1966  --  and 1968 . A steady , solid comeback is within reach . They are doing more than talking . They are acting on what they are talking about . It all adds up to one thing : The leadership of the party is being returned to the political center and the GOP moderates are again in control . The Republicans in Congress , the 17 Republican governors , General Eisenhower , and Barry Goldwater have all played a part in bringing this about . The GOP leadership in the House has been placed in more moderate and activist hands in the election of Rep. Gerald Ford of Michigan . The GOP Senate leadership has been kept in moderate hands by retaining Sen. Thomas Kuchel as minority whip while Sen. Everett McKinley Dirksen resumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most to bring about the ouster of Dean Burch as national chairman . Their impact on party policy , always moderate to liberal , is mounting . The new Republican steering committee , proposed by Sen. Dirksen , will he on the moderate side . It will include 5 governors , 5 former GOP presidential nominees , and he 12 from the Senate and House . The effect of all of these events is to put the moderates back on top . Mr. Goldwater himself helped . lie had a hard decision to make and he made it on the side of party unity . In the early stages of the move to replace Dean Burch as chairman , Mr. Goldwater strongly resisted . He did not want Mr. Burch removed , he said , because this action would mean " repudiating me . " But the pressure mounted and in the end he had to decide whether to yield or put up a losing battle that would split the party badly . His most ardent supporters wanted him to yield nothing , either on personnel or policy . They wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To his great credit and no surprise to those who know him , Senator Goldwater chose to serve the Republican Party . He put party loyalty ahead of loyalty to his own brand of conservatism . He did this by acceding to the ouster of Mr. HMO and by taking as his own choice the opposition 's candidate for chairman , Ray C. Bliss of Ohio , To put it plainly , Mr. Goldwater stepped down grace- fully while being pushed . He remains a significant voice in party affairs , but not the dominant voice . He will be on the team but not as quarterback . The Republicans have reason to feel some confidence . The party imbalance in Congress is momentarily dismaying but the party balance in the electorate is encouraging . In this century Republicans have been in the White House as long as Democrats ? 32 years . Out of the 306 million votes cast for president in the five elections since World War II , including the Johnson landslide , there have been just l , 677,000 more Democratic than Republican votes . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imbalance as the GOP returns to its mooring at the political center .
