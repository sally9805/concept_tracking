113 GATSBY AND THE SEA GULL A Story by Kenneth Lamott One of the duties I liked least during the four years I taught high-school courses at San Quentin Prison was to make out , at the end of each academic quarter , a progress report for every student in my class . These reports  --  submitted in triplicate  --  contained not only grades in class work and citizenship but also spaces for " Special Observations . " We teachers were encouraged to record here the student 's personality traits and evidence of his rehabilitation rather than his formal academic work because , it was said , the teacher 's report carried considerable weight with the parole board . We were expected to show these comments to the student and have him sign the report as evidence that he was being kept au courant with his progress . I soon discovered that a key verb in the prison worker 's vocabulary was " to mature , " with its related noun , adjective , and adverb . In writing up progress reports for a class of twenty-five or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes on this theme . " Williams has applied himself earnestly to his work and shows growing evidence of maturity , " I might write of a conscientious but dull car thief . A plausible young writer of bad checks was described with the words , " Immature in years , he is beginning to show some sense of his responsibilities as an adult " ; while " Cardenas ' work has been somewhat less than satisfactory this quarter , probably due more to the immaturity of his attitude than to any lack of ability , " stated , rather badly , my professional judgment of a lazy narcotics addict . Sometimes , as in the case of a prisoner whose name was Dobson , but who was known to the class as the Sea Gull , none of the possible variations seemed appropriate , and the job of composing " Special Observations " became a laborious struggle with the inadequacies of the English language . The Sea Gull was a small man , about thirty-five or forty years old , short , spare , and wispy , with a head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His hair was thin and sandy , his eyes brown , his mouth small . All told , his appearance would have been the ultimate in insignificance except that he managed somehow to broadcast a rather moving confidence in the essential goodwill of the world around him . Everything , his face seemed to say , will turn out all right in the end . I never found out the crime of which he had been convicted , but , judging by the man himself , I should guess it was on the order of conspiracy to commit petty theft or that apocryphal felony , mopery in the second degree . He was called the Sea Gull because of his daily raids on the trash cans in his cellblock , which , against all prison regulations , he regularly rifled , carrying back to his cell odds and ends of precious rubbish  --  an empty cookie box , a broken shoelace , an old magazine . Despite the best efforts of the mess-hall guards , he also managed to smuggle out slices of bread , bits of cake , cold cuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper napkins and hid under his blue denim shirt . The first time I saw him he was burdened with a bundle consisting of several library books and National Geographies secured by a cloth strap , and a large screw-top jar partly filled with a brown liquid . He put this baggage on my desk as he hunted for the ducat , or pass , directing him to report to school . I saw some leaves floating in the brown liquid and asked him if it was tea . He said it was , and added , " I like to have a little something in the middle of the afternoon . You do n't mind , do you ? " I told him I did n't mind so long as he took his tea in the break between classes . He assured me that he would , found the ducat at last , and took a seat to the accompaniment of general merriment . I realized that we had acquired a prison character , 114 GATSBY AND THE SEA GULL but the Sea Gull looked so harmless that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To vary the intellectual diet of the English class , which consisted chiefly of a rather doughy high-school anthology of American writers , I occasionally brought a book from home , which I would read aloud , stopping whenever I came to a good point for discussion or , as we teachers say , whenever anybody had something to contribute . When the Sea Gull joined the class we were in the midst of The Great Gatsby , which I had picked not only because I admired it but also because I thought my students ' reactions to the story might be illuminating . They were . When I finished Gatsby several days later , an attack on the book was led by Cardenas , the narcotics addict , who was , as I have already said , immature and lazy , but who was also quite articulate . He was a good-looking boy of about twenty , with a dark , high-cheeked Indian face . " It just ai n't right to let Tom Buchanan get away with it , " Cardenas said earnestly . " Tom was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know he did it . When he told Wilson it was Gatsby driving the yellow car , that was the same as if he 'd killed Gatsby himself . Besides , he was a woman beater . It 's a bad book . It should n't have been wrote . " I argued that in my opinion Gatsby certainly was n't an immoral book , but a strong feeling remained in the class that if Fitzgerald had been a better writer , he would certainly have punished Tom Buchanan appropriately . Nobody seemed to find it ironic that this was the general opinion of a group of convicted felons . Because I was disappointed by the response to one of my favorite books , I deliberately tried to stir up an argument . " I 'll tell you why you do n't like the book , " I said . " Gatsby is exactly what you want to be . You 'd all like to make a lot of money in the rackets and live in a big house and have society people come to your parties and fly your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , gentlemen , you missed the whole point of the book . Con-gratulations . " This was received in a silence that I interpreted to mean that I 'd hit pretty close to the mark . Cardenas pursed his lips and frowned , but before he said anything , the Sea Gull put up his hand . " What the teacher means , " he said , " is that Gatsby was a professional criminal . He had done wrong and he had to pay for it . That 's why the author had to kill him . " " That is n't what I meant at all , " I protested . " Do n't you remember that Nick Carraway told Gatsby he 's worth more than all the rest of them ? Does n't that make it pretty clear that Gatsby is really the hero of the story ? " " Then why did he get killed ? " Cardenas asked . " It was the only right way to finish the story , " I said . My eye fell on the open book on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' line of thought , I read again the familiar passage from the last page : " Gatsby believed in the green light , the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us . It eluded us then , but that 's no matter  --  tomorrow we will run faster , stretch out our arms farther . . . . And one fine morning " So we beat on , boats against the current , borne back ceaselessly into the past . " Cardenas shook his head and looked puzzled . With one exception , the rest of the class showed even less response . I let them wait for a moment , and then I called on the Sea Gull , who was waving an arm frantically to catch my attention . His face was alight with the pleasure of intellectual discovery . " This is the most important thing in the book , " the Sea Gull said . " I think you 're right , " I said gratefully . " Go on . " " As I see it , " the Sea Gull said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before us . Once we come to understand the obligations of mature citizenship , there 's nothing we ca n't accomplish . He 's saying the same thing Shakespeare was when he wrote , ' This above all , to thine own self be true . ' If we have enough education to understand them , the great writers all have messages for us that can help us solve our personal problems . " During the Sea Gull 's speech , Cardenas yawned and looked at the ceiling and I guessed that he was indeed slipping away into an orgiastic future of Cadillacs and Jaguars , of movie starlets and infinitely expandable checking accounts , of rolling fields of the purest golden-leaf marihuana and snowy mountains of unadulterated heroin , of blind parole officers , indifferent policemen , and amiable judges . " Thank you very much , Dobson , " I said to the Sea Gull . " I do n't think you 've quite got the point , and I 'm afraid we 've already spent all the time we can discussing this topic . " I rapped on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next day in the doughy anthology . I tried Before abandoning a pedagogical career for other pursuits , Kenneth Lamott taught a variety of students , including high-school dropouts , foreigners , would-be novelists , and San Quentin prisoners . His new novel , " The Bastille Day Parade , " is to be published in January . to avoid the Sea Gull 's eyes . But it was impossible to ignore him entirely , and the look of betrayal on his face made me feel like an assassin . Afriend of mine who is on a college faculty once told me that teachers are afflicted for their sins by having gifted students . Dobson was my gifted student . He had an astonishing store of information he had picked out of books with the same indiscriminate enthusiasm with which he raided trash barrels . He had read Spinoza and Norman Vincent Peale , Trollope and Frank Yerby , Shakespeare and Adela Rogers St. Johns , and from each he had carried away a message of hope and cheer . He could quote Polonius ; he found Lear an exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proverb advising us to try , try again , and Joyce 's Portrait of the Artist a work showing the advantages of a church-centered childhood . Whatever the assignment was , he always managed to work in a nugget or two of optimism . At the same time he managed to make himself thoroughly obnoxious to the rest of the class . The Sea Gull 's troubles started in earnest when he began to raise a beard and moustache , a privilege permitted prisoners about to go home . Unfortunately , his whiskers came out a rather sparse , gingery orange , which did nothing to dignify his appearance but , instead , exposed him to a daily barrage of ridicule . Cardenas compared him to a billy goat , a beaver , a catfish , and several species of monkey . He was accused of harboring lice , fleas , cockroaches , and mice . He was charged with using shoe polish to achieve his beard 's peculiar shade of orange . The Sea Gull endured all this with good humor , smiling politely , as if he rather enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his time became shorter and he became the object of envy as well as of contempt , the class treated the Sea Gull more roughly . Matters came close to violence one afternoon when his tea-jar disappeared while he was sharpening a pencil . Cardenas had done it , of course , but before I managed to recover the jar the Sea Gull 's face had turned white under his gingery whiskers and he was screaming at Cardenas in a piping , furious voice . After class , he stopped at my desk to apologize for having made a scene . " I 'm really sorry , " he said . " There was a reason for it , though . A psychiatrist once told me it was a lot better for me to get it out than to bottle it up inside . " I told him that was no doubt true , but that one had to learn to control one 's temper in public.a story by Kenneth Lamott 115 The Sea Gull agreed earnestly and promised to try to keep a grip on himself in the future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tea-jar , now empty , the bundle of books and magazines , a full-size drawing board , and two cardboard boxes , he was carrying a cloth sack that from its outline appeared to be full of lobsters although it probably contained nothing more interesting than miscellaneous gleanings from the cellblock . As the Sea Gull loaded himself up for his trip back to his cell , I saw that he had really reached his capacity and offered to carry something for him . He gave me the drawing board , and we walked up the stairs , which were quiet now that the rest of the students had departed in the daily three-thirty scramble . " How short are you ? " I asked . " Fifteen days and a get-up , " the Sea Gull said . " What are you going to do when you get out ? " " My parole officer got me a job as a shipping clerk in San Francisco , " he said . " I 'm going to work in the daytime and take classes at the University of California extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study ? " " I want to get a doctorate in psychology , " he said . " That sounds a little ambitious , " I said cautiously . He looked at me anxiously . " You do n't think I ca n't do it , do you ? " " It 'll take a long time , " I said . " Particularly when you start out without even a high-school diploma . " " I have lots of time , " he said . " That does n't bother me . " I wished him luck . We had arrived at the front door of the education building and were faced with the problem of finding some way for the Sea Gull to carry his drawing board . After trying some other arrangements , I tucked the board under his elbow so that it was partly supported by one of his bony hips , and he scuttled away sidewise , like a frightened crab , until he disappeared into the Big Yard on his way to his cell for the four o'clock head count . Everybody behaved reasonably well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fierce whispering from the row of chairs where both the Sea Gull and Cardenas sat , but nothing developed of which I had to take official notice until the next Thursday , which was our day for Audio-Visual Aids . The prison was well stocked with educational films , many of which were industrial documentaries that celebrated the dramatic saga of frozen foods , or the development of the out-116 GATSBY AND THE SEA GULL board motor , or the contribution of the soft-drink industry to the American way of life . There were also some abr:dged versions of such films as David Copperfield , The Ox-Bow Incident , and Les Miserables . I discovered , as I consulted our schedule while herding my men from the classroom to the auditorium , that it was our turn to have Les Miserables again . Since I had already seen this movie four times in San Quentin , the reaction of my class was as predictable as the next full moon . Fredric March , as Jean Valjean , the ex-convict who becomes mayor of a city , would be cheered while Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the climactic scene in which he removes his uniform hat and dives into the Seine , there would be an outbreak of unfettered applause . As soon as we were inside the auditorium I shut the door and counted heads to make sure nobody had slipped away as we walked down the hall . The Sea Gull , I noticed , had brought all his gear with him , piling it up on two empty chairs , one on each side of him . Cardenas was sitting near him , chatting with a crony . When everybody was accounted for , I turned off the light and sat down in my chair by the door . As the movie rolled on , the class was not very noisy , but there was no question whom they were rooting for . " Bum beef ! " somebody called out when the young Valjean-March appeared in the dock for stealing a loaf of bread . As one man , the class groaned in affected agony when the youthful Javert-Laughton , standing stiffly at attention , almost broke into tears as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's old Bruce , " somebody whispered loudly as an overseer strode between the rows of sweating convicts on the galley . " That 's not Bruce , that 's Vinegarface in the East Block , " somebody else insisted . Several of the men had seen the movie before , and I sympathized with their boredom and was willing to put up with a little noise , so long as it remained good-natured . In any case , regardless of the reactions of the other men , I was sure the Sea Gull was watching the movie earnestly , drinking in the evidence that Crime Does Not Pay , that Right Will Triumph over Might , and that Mercy Is Greater than Justice . When we reached the wonderful chase through the sewers of Paris , the class became quiet as they watched Javert-Laughton , malevolent in a cloak and hunting cap , stalk his quarry . Then , with no more warning than a single howl of outrage , a fight broke out in the dark room . Against the screen , I could see the silhouettes of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handtouched the light switch , I knew they were the Sea Gull and Cardenas . As the light went on , something made of glass crashed to the floor . I saw Cardenas easily holding the Sea Gull at arm 's length , while the smaller man , blind with fury , swung his puny fists in the air . On the floor a cold bean sandwich and the fragments of the broken jar lay in a dark pool of tea and leaves . The Sea Gull 's books had been scattered over the floor . Some of them were now lying under distant chairs and some in the tea . I sent a messenger for Mr. Bruce , the education-building guard ; then I told Cardenas to stay where he was , and ordered the Sea Gull to sit on the other side of the room . " He was trying to steal my books , " the Sea Gull said in a tight voice . He picked up two of his books , crossed the room , and crumpled in a chair , where , holding his bearded face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other men were embarrassed by his tears , and by the time Mr. Bruce arrived to deal out justice , even Cardenas was watching with some concern as the Sea Gull 's skinny shoulders heaved with long sobs . Mr. Bruce entered the room and delivered the policeman 's classic opening line , " What 's going on here ? " I explained that our Audio-Visual period had been broken up by a fight , and identified Cardenas and the Sea Gull as the combatants . Mr. Bruce wanted to know who started the fight . I said I did n't know , but Cardenas , pointing righteously at the Sea Gull , supplied the answer . The Sea Gull , his face still buried in his hands , did n't deny it , and , unlikely as it seemed that he would have assaulted Cardenas without provocation , I knew that in the eyes of the prison disciplinary committee , he was guilty of starting a fight and that was that . " All right , men , let 's go , " Mr. Bruce said briskly . Cardenas led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face averted , following him . While a janitor cleared up the mess on the floor , I told the rest of the class that our Audio-Visual period was over for the day . Later , the janitor brought me the Sea Gull 's books and drawing board , which I locked up in a cabinet . I found out from Mr. Bruce the next day that Cardenas had been sent to the Shelf for fifteen days . ( The Shelf is a line of isolation cells that shares the top floor of a celiblock with Death Row . The amenities are few and simple . ) Meanwhile , the Sea Gull was languishing in the psychiatric ward of the prison hospital , which was not much more attractive than the Shelf . Because the end of the spring academic quarter was only a week away I could no longer put off the chore of filling out the progress reports for my class . An education-department clerk had typed in the names and numbers of the men , and all I had to do was to assign grades and fill out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home with me and made them out in the evenings , five or six at a time : " Davis is showing greater maturity in his attitude toward his class work but occasionally demonstrates hostility toward the instructor , " and so on . When I came to Cardenas and Dobson , I gave them grades of " Incomplete " and noted merely that they had dropped out . But as it turned out , both Cardenas and the Sea Gull returned before the quarter was over , Cardenas because his sentence had been commuted in the light of his exemplary behavior on the Shelf , and the Sea Gull because of a remarkable improvement in his condition . They came back the same day and sat down cheerfully in their usual places . The only visible change in either of them was that the Sea Gull had shaved off his whiskers . While the rest of the class wrote an assigned theme , I called Cardenas and the Sea Gull to the desk one at a time while I wrote their progress reports . I asked Cardenas how he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up there , " he told me . " I do n't go for the food , but it 's nice and quiet . I did a lot of reading . You know , the Bible  --  that 's all they let you have up there . First time I read the Bible in my life . Did you know the Bible says it 's better to be a live dog than a dead lion ? " I said I remembered something of the sort . " Well , " Cardenas said , " I think that 's pretty good . I never knew the Bible had things like that in it . Now , what are you going to say about me ? Do n't say I got into a fight , okay ? " I changed his Incomplete to a C and wrote that " Although Cardenas has been on the whole a cheerful and willing student , he needs to develop more maturity in his social relations in the classroom . " Cardenas signed his name without any argument , and went back to his seat , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chair at the side of my desk , I asked him what had happened to his whiskers . He smiled apologetically . " They made me shave them off , " he said . " They decided I 'd better stay here until I show some improvement in my interpersonal relations . " I told him I was sorry , but he interrupted me . " Oh , no , no . I really want to stay . While I was up there I began to realize that I still do n't have enough stability and maturity to deal with the world outside .

Finally I wrote , " Dobson has found himself in a difficult situation this quarter but I believe he is developing some insight into his problems . " It was n't at all satisfactory , but the Sea Gull nodded his agreement as he watched me write and smiled as he signed his name . Instead of going back to his seat , he asked , " Do you remember that book we read , The Great Gatsby ? " I said I remembered it well . " While I was up in the psychiatric ward I thought a lot about that book , " the Sea Gull said . " I think it helped me more than anything else . It 's true what Fitzgerald says .
