A Walk in the Forest A story by Monica Sterba Have I told you , " said Dagobert , " about the day I first heard the locusts ? " " No , " I said , lying . It could not be avoided anyhow , and I knew how upset he would be if I said yes . Next to Dagobert , a shock-headed cretin lifted his spoon and dropped it with a splash into his plate of greasy broth . We have a little elbow room here , but not enough to allow such manners . And the cretin anyhow was an administrative mistake ; he should have been put elsewhere , in another sort of Institution , wherever they put such people . We resented him sometimes , in our mild way . " The locusts , " said Dagobert dreamily . " It was a warm evening in May . I was alone in my office at the Ministry . Properly speaking , of course , it was not my office . I shared it with a Mr. Car-stairs , and a Miss B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A Miss B ? " " Brindle , " I said helpfully , before I could stop myself . " Brindle , of course . But then I have told you the story . " " No , no , " I assured him . " But you 've told me about Miss Brindle . " " What could I have told you about Miss Brindle ? I hardly knew Miss Brindle . " Dagobert 's bland functionary 's voice began to rasp and squeak . " If you mean to insinuate that Miss Brindle ... that I and Miss Brindle . . . " " Please , please , Dagobert . I meant nothing at all . And do calm down ; they are watching us already . You only told me that you had shared an office with a Miss Brindle . I remembered the name because it 's such an unusual one . " " Not unusual , " returned Dagobert , still squeaking . " Not unusual at all . I have known at least seven Brindles. " 80 A WALK IN THE FOREST " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brindle Brindle all the time . " I , in turn , was losing control ; but then I had sat politely through at least a thousand of his recitals , and sooner or later there comes a moment when one 's patience gives out . " Brindle Brindle Brindle. " said Dagobert , and began to cry . " Dagobert ! Do calm down . They are all looking at us . Please , Dagobert . I did n't mean to offend you . " " I 'm sorry , " said Dagobert , making an effort . " I 'm sorry too . " We were back to behaving like civilized people . " You must understand , " said Dagobert. " it 's the strain of hearing them all the time . " " I know . " " You will hear them too , soon . " " I have no doubt of it . " I had hoped the effort of pulling himself together would exhaust him for a little while , but as always , I was wrong . " Well then . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office that normally I shared with Mr. Carstairs and Miss Brindle . " Dagobert 's elephantine ears turned bright rod as he said the name . He was waiting for me to make insinuations . I was waiting for him to get the story over with , knowing that his carefully trained and compartmented brain must examine and fit in every detail , however irrelevant . " I had just dropped a letter into the Internal Communications Chute . I sat down at my desk again . And then , suddenly , I hoard them . I heard the chomp chomp chomp of their little jaws . I knew what it was because I had seen a film about them once , but I could never have imagined that I would hear that noise there , in my own office , in the Ministry . I mean the office that I shared with Mr. Carstairs and Miss Brindle . " Anyway , there it was . I could tell it was a whole army of them . I looked out of the window , but there was nothing , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit late . So I rang the emergency bell . I was very frightened , but . I did remember to ring the emergency bell . " " That was the right thing to do , " I said , knowing my cues . " Yes . It 's amazing , there are so few emergencies , but when there are , the reflexes , what you 've been trained to do , does take over . It 's a good thing , too . That 's the trouble with the young , you know . They 're no longer properly conditioned . " Thank God , I thought , he 's digressing . To hear it again all the way through might have been more than I could bear . Now , instead , we shall have his lecture on the young . While Dagobert droned on , his mind following the channels that had been set for it in a past now distant beyond his conjecture , the cretin threw his head back and joyously gargled his broth . Mercifully , the gargling did not last long , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other end of the table . At this Dagobert interrupted his lecture to look around . " Some of them , " he commented , nodding at me wisely , " ca n't breathe . " " They only think that , " I said , though at one point I had thought it myself . " Anyone can breathe if he tries . " " Others , " Dagobert went on , " are afraid they will he put into a folding eggbox . That 's awfully silly , is n't it ? Or that the buildings will fall on them . Now that , in a way , I can understand . I had some work at the Ministry in connection with building regulations , and I can tell you , quite frankly , now that Pm no longer working there  --  though mind you , it 's disloyal  --  and the buildings are very good , on the whole ? " There was a serious disturbance on the other side of the dining room , and someone was carried out . Dagobert watched warily . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " there 's been more of that lately . There 's a new crowd coming in . And do you know , there are many more people here than when I first came . If you ask me , it 's ominous . There 's a kind of broody feeling about it . It makes me think of that warm evening in May ... " I closed my eyes and tried to picture the eternally absent Miss Brindle . Click of sharp heels , blue mouth , pink-and-silver-rimmed glasses . What matter , they are all the same . Like the Dagoberts . Still others , I thought , going back to our earlier conversation , are frightened by mirrors ; they imagine if a mirror can duplicate once it can duplicate endlessly , and if ever they are caught between two mirrors  --  as sometimes happens , even to the most circumspect  --  they will be lost forever , will disappear in an infinite row of themselves . In my youth , the complex mental disease we suffer from was confined to the more sensitive ; Born in Vienna , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarah Lawrence , and sines her marriage has lived in Switzerland and England . Recently  --  besides writing  --  she has been helping to organize an international entomology congress . This story is her first published work . now it is attacking , in surprising numbers , men like Dagobert . Dagobert will tell you that he likes people , and that on the toilet ( the only place , outside , that we are ever alone ) he finds it cozy and companionable to see , under the three-quarter door , the feet of the person waiting . And there are even patients who long for the oxygen cabinets they sometimes used before coming here , although right in our yard there is air which is relatively pure , and can be breathed in the open . They have no idea what has made them ill , no conscious wish to escape from the unbearable overcrowding outside  --  only their locusts and egg-boxes , their inarticulate terror of being crushed . " The crunch of their little jaws , " Dagobert was saying . " I thought , if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ? Because everyone says , of course , they are extinct . Maybe on the great plains , some still might live ; but there are no great plains . So  --  I figured it out , eventually , you see  --  they must be down below . In the underground stations , perhaps . " The new man on my right jabbed me with his elbow . " Yesterday soup , " he said . " Today liquid diet . But , my friend , I am not so stupid as that . Soup is also a liquid , is n't it ? " " They 're getting a little short of food outside , " I replied . " The liquid diet is quite adequate in vitamins , and no doubt it 's the best they can do at the moment . I admit it 's not very exciting . " I try to defend the Administration on these occasions . So few of the patients realize how fortunate they are to be here . " But do you know , " said Dagobert , " the funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . Because I 've never really come across a locust , except long ago , in the films . I ca n't even be sure what they look like . " I myself get a bit impatient sometimes . but I have no wish to complain . For this , in spite of everything-. is the most peaceful place I have ever known ; and I have managed to stay here , classified as incurable , for seventeen years . When I was first sent here , with a strength of will I would never have thought myself capable of , I resisted their efforts to readjust me . And soon , to my amazement , they gave in ; they stopped the drugs and the treatments , and left me alone . This also , of course , was an administrative mistake . Someone has forgotten to check on what is happening here ; that we are , relatively speaking , happy and at peace , and in full possession of our delusions , a neglected garden of dementia . Now it has come to a point where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 1 . : 11 ( /ticrt SI violent with sedatives ; the well-behaved , except at meals and bedtimes , get almost no attention at all . Here , in this wonderfully old-fashioned Institution , we have more room than we have ever had ; our own dark corners in the vast recreation rooms ; our own yard , large enough so that we can be out of each other 's sight for moments at a time . And outside the yard , beyond the high wall , is the forest . A real forest , not a park ; one of the last forests left . We are in the very middle of it , and it covers almost a hundred square miles . More vividly than anything , I remember the amazement I felt when I was first brought here . at seeing , on the way , the miles and miles of green trees . I could not understand why they had been left ; perhaps the Authorities thought that one or two forests of this size should be kept , as a sort of monument to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help in the rehabilitation of patients like us . But the need for land must be getting even more desperate ; and one day . no doubt , they will cut the forest down . Though perhaps not in my lifetime . And meanwhile , for whatever reason , it is there ; and my greatest joy is to see the treetops above the high wall . In the past , calmer patients were sometimes taken , in groups of two or three , for little walks in the forest , along the drive ; then it was decided that this " implied favoritism and fostered antisocial tendencies " as I heard one of the doctors say , and the practice was stopped . There were also escapes ; those brave and fortunate enough to walk in the forest alone . We never saw any of them again . No doubt they were quickly recaptured , and disappeared into the obscurity of the Severely Disturbed Wing , but I like to think of them still alone and still in the forest  --  though , of course , it , is ridiculous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they could easily be tracked down . There are roads , of course , and probably observation posts , and they would have only a hundred square miles of hiding places . Only a hundred  --  more than any of us have ever seen ! A hundred square miles of forest ! I have lain awake nights thinking about it . It seems as vast as the vanished deserts or Columbus 's ocean , more mysterious than the edge of the world when people believed it flat . I myself , of course , have not thought of escaping . Or rather . I have thought of it , and realized that for a few hours ' or only minutes ' real solitude , I might have to spend years in the Severely Disturbed Wing . They might even , if I call attention to myself i. lr a fashion , make a deter-82 A WALK IN THE FOREST mined effort to readjust me and send me away . I am a sensible man ; I have no with to jeopardize a bearable vegetation , which is the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enough that the trees are there . And yet  --  when Dagobert is on about Miss Brindle , and the cretin 's table manners at their worst , with the Institution itself becoming more crowded , and rumors of growing shortages outside  --  if only one could go for a walk in the forest , just a little walk , with no one 's knowing , and come back home again . h le I dreamt of the forest , Dagobert had resumed his lecture on the young . " They 're no longer properly conditioned , " he explained , waving his spoon . " When I was a boy , we enjoyed learning by heart . We memorized our schedules . Nobody had to ring bells to remind us of things . We memorized everything . And I was especially good at it . I knew all the jingles  --  all the names of all the soaps  --  all the stations on the underground  --  everyone 's telephone numbers . In those days , we still had our own apartments , with private telephones in them , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all the world , surely , " said the man opposite , a big , fat , friendly man whose voice rose to a high falsetto at the end of each sentence . " Of course not , " said Dagobert impatiently . " Of course not . " His mouth worked ; he wanted to go on , but his audiences were worse and worse these days , and it was beginning to tell on him . " There would be trillions , " said the fat man , and laughed , a rich happy laugh , as though he found this fact both funny and heartening . " Trillions and trillions of telephone numbers . Little and big trillions . " Dagohert put his spoon down with a trembling hand . The fat man 's laugh had shrunk to a chuckle , but he was still muttering about trillions . Dagobert stared at him for a moment , then turned to me and said : " You know , I do n't like these new people at all . And there are so many of them . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear yourself think . But you can hear the locusts all right . When the noise is louder , they get louder too . Their little jaws go faster and faster . . . " " You 're wrong , Dagobert ; their little jaws are not going at all , because things have got very tight outside . They hardly get anything except liquid diet now . " I spoke softly , knowing he would not hear me well through the general din , and that he never paid much attention to what Isaid , except when he thought I was making insinuations about Miss Brindle . " Yes ? " said Dagobert absently , waving his spoon again . " Have I told you about the day I first heard the locusts ? " The spoon was now full of liquid diet , which splashed on the cretin next to him . The cretin , thinking this was a game , filled his own spoon and aimed it at Dagobert . " Stop that at once , please , " said a voice behind him . The cretin obediently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his locusts : the fat man was still going on , in a low voice , about his trillions . I envied them their powers of withdrawal . The meals here were becoming a trial . The attendant who had come to the rescue put the cretin 's spoon back into his bowl and smiled wearily at me over his head . smiled back . He was a kind man , and I suspected that he and most of our nicer attendants had taken jobs here because they also wished to escape the life outside . But lately they were getting overworked and nervous . And everything seemed particularly bad today . The fat man was coming out of his trance . He leaned confidentially across the table . I braced myself for a long recitation of numbers . " Have you heard ? " he said in a stage whisper which curbed his falsetto and made him far more understandable to his neighbors . " Heard what ? " The fat man withdrew again for a minute . He leaned back in his chair , counted something out quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sang a few numbers in his high falsetto . I waited patiently for the ritual to he finished , although I had no interest in whatever imaginary revelation he was about to make . We do try , on the whole , to be polite to each other . Even Dagobert ; even the cretin , insofar as he is capable of it . " There is to be a Ministry Inspection today . " " A Ministry Inspection ! " Forgetting my usual caution , I whispered excitedly , and just as loudly , back . " There has n't been one in four years ! But how do you know ? " " I heard the nurses talking about it . They 're all quite worried , I think . These are big Inspectors . Bigger than usual . So big ? " The fat man made an expansive gesture , overturning his neighbor 's bowl . His neighbor , a wizened creature who never said anything , threw back his head and howled . A new bowl of liquid diet was produced , and the howling stopped magically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiped up the mess under the fixed sad stare of its owner , and then went off , giving me another weary smile . Also , " went on the fat man , his stage whisper growing with the importance of his words , " I 've been hearing things from a man who has contacts outside . I ca n't tell you who he is , because " ? he looked furtively at Dagobert and the cretin ? " there might be spies . " " In the Ministry , " said Dagobert loudly , " we knew what to do with informers . " Dagobert 's branch of the Ministry had had nothing to do with informers of any sort , but the fat man 's conspiratorial airs were beginning to infect him . " Oh , I did n't mean any reference to anyone , " the fat man said quickly . " In fact , " Dagobert continued , " they were very cautious at the Ministry . Even their most trusted employees  --  like myself  --  were questioned very thoroughly when it came to something out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the locusts ? " Although I was nearly sure the fat man 's friend with contacts was as illusory as Dagobert 's insects , the anxiety I had been feeling lately about the fate of the Institution made me eager to hear any rumor brought by the new inmates . For once , I interrupted Dagobert . " What does he say , this man with contacts ? " " He says , " whispered the fat man , leaning toward me , " he says , it ca n't go on much longer now . " " Exactly what I 've been telling everyone . " Dagobert broke in , undaunted . " They must have already chewed their way through the foundations . You would think it 's only that other sort of insects  --  termites  --  do that . But no . When they get really hungry ? " " But what is it ? The Institution ? " " He did n't tell me , " the fat man answered morosely . " But " ? brightening up ? " I assure you he had contacts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no doubt of it . Other people have used them as well . " " I would n't know about that . But he 'd been in a high position , too . He told me . Not one of your punch-card feeders . " The fat man glanced quickly at Dagobert , and added in a softer voice , " I did n't mean any reference to anyone . " " I myself , of course , was never a punch-card feeder , " said Dagobert with immense dignity . " But at the Ministry there was great respect for such people . They wore purple smocks at work , very smart , with little collars . I can picture it now . . . " " And I , " I remarked softly , but not softly enough , " can hear the chomp chomp chomp of their little jaws . " " There you are , " said Dagobert triumphantly . a story by Monica Sterba 83 For once , he had paid attention to what 1 said . " He hears them . Soon you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Everyone will hear them . And then at last , at last , the Ministry will be able to give the necessary orders . " The pronunciation of this sacred phrase left Dagobert , as always , pale and trembling . He would never say what " the necessary orders " were ; I suppose they concerned some secret and drastic method of doing away with the locusts . If anyone questioned him too closely on this subject , he became very upset . I made a warning sign to the fat man , who had not yet heard this part of the routine , but it was too late . " What orders ? " asked the fat man innocently . Dagobert became still paler and dug his spoon into the table . I tried hard to think of some way of distracting them both to avoid a scene . Our end of the table had already received enough attention today . Distraction came , however , in the form of the three inspectors , who at that moment entered the room . The fat man had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone was behaving that something special was about to happen , for any tension or anxiety in the staff is immediately reflected in the manners of the inmates . The few of us who realized what they were fell silent and stared , in timid fascination , at the gray figures at the end of the long hall . The rest kept on with their eating and their din . The Inspectors only glanced around the dining hall , and were ushered out again . As they were leaving , Dagobert rather belatedly got up and bowed ; two or three others imitated him . The attendants paid no attention , but began to gather in little groups , talking uncomfortably . In Dagobert 's words , which he used repeatedly during the rest of our meal , there was a very broody feeling . After lunch was the time scheduled for television and occupational therapy . Things had been so lax lately that our section of the occupational-therapy class was attended regularly only by the cretin , who would string beads for hours , drooling happily , and an earnest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occupational therapist , a dry , antiseptic young woman who ignored his shy overtures and concentrated grimly on the cretin 's progress . On the whole , it was a peaceful occasion ; Dagobert and I would sometimes go there to do a bit of weaving when things were noisy downstairs . That day , however , it was necessary to put on a show for the Inspectors , 84 A WALK IN THE FOREST and about ten of us  --  the two regulars and some of the " better " patients , including Dagobert , the fat man , and myself  --  were rounded up and marched upstairs to the occupational-therapy roOrn . Miss Pivot bustled about , doling out beads , Plasticine , and wool . I noticed that the best finished products , most of them done by the occupational therapist herself , had been arranged on a big table to make an elaborate display . I gazed at this for some time , and then turned toward the window . The room had a lovely view of the treetops above the wall ; I was looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wet clay was thrust into my hand . Startled , I dropped it ; it fell on my shoes , with an unpleasant squishy sound . I stared at my shoes for a moment with distaste , and then bent down to pick the clay off them . Miss Pivot hovered over me , making an unappealing nervous gesture with clasped hands . " Please , " she said , " would you make a pot ? " " I did pots long ago , " I said , in mild protest . " The last time I came here , I did weaving . " " Yes , I know , " she said , " but I do want someone doing clay , and it 's too difficult with the others . Please do . You need only begin it . You can do weaving the next time . " Her voice was harsh ; she was asking for my complicity , but would show no kindness in return . I began resignedly to fiddle with the damned clay . The young man who was in love with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he folded delicately in a complicated series of folds . He must have learned this somewhere , long ago  --  Miss Pivot , I was sure , could not have mastered anything so intricate . It was amazing to see him turn a square of paper into one of these graceful winged shapes , and soon I was watching him intently , forgetting my pot . Miss Pivot never looked at him ; she trotted nervously back and forth between the cretin and the fat man , who had tangled up the threads in his loom . Never had I seen her so overwrought ; the whole room was charged with her fear . Even the cretin seemed aware of it ; he gaped up at her and began absentmindedly to undo the beads he had done . They made a little clicking sound as he dropped them , one by one , on the floor . " Please , " said Miss Pivot . " Henry , you know it 's not like that , dear . The other way . Here , let me show you again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cretin . " Do get on with your pot , please , " she snarled at me . Then she gave a little gasp and wheeled around , the cretin 's beads in her hand , to face the door which was slowly opening . The Inspectors , accompanied by our two head doctors , walked intothe room . This time , mercifully , Dagobert did not get up and bow . I told myself firmly that this was a routine event , even though it had not happened for a long time , and that only a stupid woman like Miss Pivot would be made so nervous by it . But the tension was contagious . I had a sudden acute wish to straighten my collar , which began to tickle my neck unbearably , but my hands were wet and sticky with clay . Miss Pivot stood there , smiling vaguely , holding the beads , and the young man with the bird watched her , his face contorted with terror and sympathy and love . " Just carry on , " said one of the head doctors encouragingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violently kneading and slapping my clay , and the others fell to work like robots , except the cretin who continued to gape  --  and anyhow Miss Pivot still had his beads . One of the Inspectors talked quietly to the doctors ; the other two looked restlessly around the room  --  not at Miss Pivot 's carefully prepared exhibit , but at us . Especially the cretin . One of them frowned and made a note on his little pad . They ignored the beautiful bird of Miss Pivot 's admirer , although he was holding it up at arm 's length , pretending to see if the wings were straight , in a desperate effort to attract their attention . Miss Pivot was introduced to the Inspectors , and gave sharp little smiles and nods , shifting her beads from one hand to the other . Finally , one of the inspectors walked to the table where the exhibits lay , picked up a figurine as if to feet its weight , and put it down again . Ile then walked quickly back to the others , still standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Miss Pivot and to us , they were gone . Miss Pivot turned back to the cretin with her pointed nose twitching ; she handed him the beads without a word and went over to the table to clear the exhibition pieces away . Her adorer sat dumbly , the bird like a dead creature in his lap . The sense of doom these ridiculous Inspectors brought with them was too much ; I remembered saying lightly to Dagobert that morning that anyone could breathe if he tried , but now I was beginning to feel , as in the days when I was really ill , that I could n't , and that I must get out of the room at once . I asked shakily if I might go and wash my hands . Miss Pivot did not answer ; I took this for consent , and went out . In the corridor , I felt better , and walked slowly toward the bathroom at the end , concentrating on taking deep , even breaths . The corridor was empty , but I noticed that one door was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cups . Probably the Inspectors were being where that , to prevent fainting , one should put one 's head between one 's knees ; I tried this , but my back was too stiff , and it only made me feel worse . I gave up and leaned back against a tree trunk , waiting for my sickness to reach a crisis . But the wet ground seemed to revive me ; slowly my breathing became easier and my head began to clear . I became aware of the sounds around me again ; the rain had stopped , and now there were birds calling to each other , as in the Institution yard at evening . I opened my eyes . It was still the forest . Trees , I suppose , are much the same everywhere , but here there were so many of them , and they seemed to grow around and against and through each other , in a bewildering tangle without pattern , unlike anything I had ever seen . A whole maze of hiding places ; no one , making this artificially , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many shades of green , and it was all so amazingly quiet , and yet alive with little sounds  --  a leaf falling , a twig breaking , a branch moving gently , something scurrying , scuffling  --  were there still small wild animals left in this forest ? At any rate , it was not a human footstep , nothing large enough to be pursuing me . I stood up and moved to the other side of the big tree I had been sitting under . Here , leaning against the tree , I felt sheltered and safe ; from behind it , no one could see me , and before me was a screen of thorny bushes , through which it seemed impossible that anyone would approach . I thought happily that I might have been the first person in years to set foot in the particular patch of mossy ground where I was standing . Then , for what may have been minutes , I tried to capture , to memorize what I was seeing , but the tangled intricacy of growth was so bizarre that my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was left baffled but elated , holding only an impression of shimmering green . I forgot that the Institution was only a short distance away ; I was alone in the wilderness , like Crusoe , like Byrd , like Scott . Everything that existed , existed for me only ; and to be so alone , even briefly , was more delightful than anything on earth . At that moment , as if a sign had been given , a wan afternoon sun appeared through the branches . The forest became a dancing pattern of light and shade , and a pathway of light fell before me on the ground . Feeling now very happy and very much a pioneer , I took this as an omen , and started along the path of light . It a story by Monica Sterba 89 seemed as good a direction as any to take ; as far as I could make out from the sun , it led away from the Institution  --  but unfortunately straight to the thorny thicket ahead . I could , of course , have avoided the thicket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I looked in vain for a gap , and then at last tried to part the bushes with my arm . This tore my coat , and gave me a number of bleeding scratches ; it was extraordinary how the bushes clung . I was being childish and wasting time ; the thicket would have to he circumvented after all . In less than a minute , I reached the end of it ; it was only a double line of bushes , and not as long as I had thought . Beyond it the trees seemed to be thinning out . Puzzled , I walked on faster , stumbled over a root , and stopped dead . Ahead of me , glimmering gray through the trees , was a high wall . I had a moment of panic  --  but only a moment . My nerves , already a little sharpened by the last half-hour , were better than they had been when I had come out into the yard and found the gates open . This was , of course , the Institution again . How stupid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , they would find me that much sooner . No use running blindly on ; I must stop and figure this out . I had , I thought , gone at a right angle to the road , and then turned left to get through the thicket . According to the position of the sun , I had , in fact , gone away from the Institution ; unless I had made a complete half-circle and reached the back wall . I squinted up at the sun , concentrating desperately ; it seemed impossible that I had gone in a circle , for the sun would then have been on my right when I tried to get through the thicket .. .. I looked more closely at the wall . There was something unfamiliar about it  --  it seemed lighter in color than the wall of the Institution . A trick of the sun  --  or perhaps it looked different from outside . Completely bewildered now , but still calm . I walked slowly along the wall , running my hand against it . My breathing was very loud again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the wall . If only I could reach the side gate  --  if this was the Institution wall , it would have one  --  through which I might have a chance of looking without being seen . There was , in fact , a little gate , well screened by shrubs I moved away from the wall and off into the forest a little , then crept up behind the shrubs on all fours . I saw what I should have expected to see . It was , indeed , the Institution , only one of its wings was larger , and the trees in the yard were smaller ; it was probably a somewhat newer building than ours . There were a few patients and an attendant in the yard , but if they 90 A WALK IN THE FOREST did catch a glimpse of me behind the shrubs , they showed no reaction , I walked along , keeping the wall in view , till I reached the end of it . Then I looked up at the sun again , now very bright , and tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here the forest seemed to be less tangled ; there were more large trees , less undergrowth , and it was easy to keep a fairly straight line . In about sixty yards , I had reached the next wall . I was beginning to feel dizzy again , but I was able to keep walking , and gradually the dizziness became better and I went on quite automatically . as if my legs had taken control and were proceeding smoothly in the direction they had last been ordered to take . That , and a sort of nerveless curiosity , kept me going through the little strips of wood until I passed the next road , and the next Institution , and the next . I thought how well I was walking now , but that I must look rather like the cretin doing his morning round in the yard , shoulders stooped , mouth half open . But it seemed a natural way of going . And all this time the birds were still chattering , and there was still no one following me . My forest was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Institution had mushroomed everywhere instead . Every forest must come down to make room for us ; for cretins and Dagoberts and Miss Brindles , for fat men reciting numbers , for armies of locusts in purple smocks . If I had only listened , during seventeen deluded years ( how much wiser Dagobert was , pursued by the sound of gnawing ) , I would have heard them cutting it down , would have heard the trees as they fell . Or perhaps there never had been a forest ; after all , when I came to the Institution , I had seen only the trees lining the road , and leading from it , other roads lined by trees ... . It was kind of them to give us this illusion of space , when most of the sane , who live outside , have not even an acre of trees between the enormous hives of their homes . But what will they do when there are still more of us , when there is no room at all , and even these narrow spaces must be filled ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this endless maze of concealed asylums and ran , coughing and stumbling , to the nearest gate . The patients were in the yard , just being assembled to be sent inside . The same patients ? Krom might he undressing in front of the television in the recreation room Dagobert has buttonholed a new inmate and is going on about his locusts . And I might be inside too , dreaming of escape into an imaginary forest . How stupidthey are not to see me . Should I shout , or sing , or howl like my neighbor when his liquid diet is taken away ? At last one of them did notice me , and then they all began hopping , giggling , pointing , the normal reactions of the insane . I put my hands on the gate and waited . When the attendants came  --  two strange attendants , because this was not , after all , my Institution  --  I stepped back and waited politely for them to open the gate . It 's as I always say , " Dagobert , feeling himself the hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember what one 's been taught when young . The conditioning , that 's what does it . Ever since I was tiny , I 've been told about the emergency bell . Hardly any of us know how to do it here , of course . It 's only the attendants are supposed to . But I 've watched . And from my days in the Ministry ? " " What good did it do ? " asked the fat man scornfully . " By the time they got there , it was too late . " " Anyone would have been too late . He went straight down , you know . Head first . " Dagobert wagged his own head vigorously , with a pleased mysterious smile . " So what good did it do , your emergency bell ? And besides , why are you carrying on that way ? I thought he was your friend . " " He was and he was n't , you know . He had that sly way of saying things . ' Like about Miss Brindle . He used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Anyway , the main thing , you know , is to do exactly what one 's been taught . I always hold on to that . And it 's always seen me through . Like the day when I first ? " He must have wanted to very badly , to do it like that . " The fat man lowered his voice . " Ever since they brought him back , he 'd been looking funny . I thought they 'd have taken him to the Severely Disturbed . But they never did . And then he  --  listen , do you think he knew something we do n't ? Something about the agricultural crisis , maybe ? Do you think he had contacts outside ? " " Of course not , " Dagobert returned , offended . " / have contacts outside . Lots of contacts . " " You do , do you ? " the fat man said . " Oh , I bet you do . Lots and lots . Millions and billions and trillions . " He began to laugh his huge swelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table got up and started toward him . In the dining hall that evening , there was a very broody feeling .
