txt A. Calm Rusk Holds Stage for 7 Hours ' Dean Rusk , the Georgia hillbilly who became a Rhodes scholar , showed before the Senate and the country today - the bearing of a man of fortitude and forbearance that he has presented for five uncontroversial years as Secretary of State . For seven long hours in the Senate hearings on Vietnam , as in his management of American diplomacy , Mr. Rusk offered the picture of a decent , dignified , circumspect , self-controlled and self-effacing person , and once more he appeared to be unafraid of ceaseless reiteration of his dream of a civilized world . Careful and controlled throughout , the chain-smoking Mr. Rusk took not a single puff as the television cameras focused on him . He doodled , he played with his darkrimmed glasses and he allowed a jest or two , but for the most part he doggedly defended the widely known positions of the Administration and seemed to be tolerant of but unmoved by his critics . The Secretary was not easily trapped by opponents , such as Senators J.W. Fulbright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by supporters , such as Russell B. Long and Bourke Hicken. - looper . Displaying the contrasts that have made him an elusive political personality here , he was tough when berated for not seeking a compromise in Vietnam , yet retiring and uncomfortable when goaded to ruffle the drums of a " victorious " war effort . Thus it was not until the seventh hour , along about 4:15 this afternoon , that the issue // was finally joined between Mr. Rusk and his principal antagonist , Mr. Fulbright , the committee chairman , a small-town Arkansas who also became a Rhodes scholar at Oxford and an international personality . Mr. Fulbright , professorial and sardonic , read a 15-minute speech tearing at Mr. Rusk 's one-hour opening thesis and describingthe . Vietnam war as a relatively small dispute unworthy of gigantic resources and deserving of a serious effort at compromise . Mr. Rusk put the tip of his , eyeglasses to his mouth and listened thoughtfully , still as neat in his loose-fitting blue-black suit as he had been at 10 o'clock this morning . He listened to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own judgment and performance , and then returned to what he insisted on calling the simple and consistent principles that he believed were essential to the building of peace . ' As so many times before , the Secretary said over and over again that aggression itself was the principal enemy of a civillied world order . If it were permitted to succeed , then not only the immediate aggressor but also those with appetites everywhere would be encouraged to destroy the fragile stability upon which American security had depended since World War II . For an instant , there was a direct clash  --  Senator Fulbright calling for compromise and Mr. Rusk demanding what the " substance " of such a compromise could possibly be . But then the gladiators retreated again to general statements of their positions . Over-all , therefore , Mr. Rusk seemed to impose his own personality on the hearings . They were dignified and staid , often laborious , and impassioned only for brief periods of general oratory . . The Secretary appeared with an easel and chart for the television cameras , a technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. . But showmanship is not Mr. Rusk 's forte , and once or twice he seemed hard put to remember to point to the map of American alliances . He also came with a 50-page opening statement , largely prepared for him by Under Secretary George W. Ball , that covered the history and rationale of the United States commitment in Vietnam . Mr. Fulbright seemed a bit put out that an hour of television time was to be taken in familiar reiteration , but that , too , is the Secretary 's style . And he read every word without the force and persuasiveness that he can muster in unprepared repartee . The first round of questioning was sedate . Even Senator Morse , the fiery Oregonian who has bitterly denounced not only the policy but also the men guiding American efforts in Vietnam , had difficulty in piehing the carefully hedged and quietly stated thesis of Mr. Rusk . But when Senator Long tried to be helpful by invoking patriotism . Mr. Rusk remained just as much on guard . " For Pete 's sake let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their backs , " said Mr. Long , and let 's have the testimony of the heads of the American LeZion and other patriotic veterans . At this point Mr. Rush sat firm and withheld his aproval . He would not object if the committee wanted to hear the views of others , he mumbled before turning , apparently with relief , to the next questioner . Mr. Rusk , the maker of the " eyeball-to-eyeball " phrase to describe the Cuban confrontation did not indulge himself in Georgian anecdote or color . Only once did the Secretary use one of the shorthand expressions that mark much of his private conversation . When asked at the afternoon session whether there was not really some difference between the problem of resisting Communist China and that of resisting Hitler Germany in the 1930s , Mr. Rusk granted that there were some " unique " aspects about the Chinese . " But an airdale and great dane are both dogs , " he suggested in a seeming summary of his belief that Communist and Nazi aggression were of a comparable character . ?  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
