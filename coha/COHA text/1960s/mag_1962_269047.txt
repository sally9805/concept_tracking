Painter Stuart Davis is a small , rotund man who complains a good deal these days about not feeling too well . When asked specifically what ails him , he sweepingly announces , " I 'm sick ! " He may be-but the paintings in his current show at Manhattan 's Downtown Gallery reflect a state of glowing health . They are young , bright , intense , and filled with the jazzy rhythms that have always been to Davis the pulse of modern life . In all his notable career , Davis at 67 has never seemed more vigorous . <P> To a large degree , modern art has been one long exercise in rebellion , and that has suited Davis ' temperament perfectly . At 15 he joined a class run by Robert Henri , an " Ashcan School " painter who was in revolt against all the ready-made standards of beauty and proportion handed down year after year by the powerful Art Students League . Davis ' next teacher was the 1913 Armory Show , which he saw when he was not yet 20 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gauguin used color , not as nature had it , but almost arbitrarily in accordance with artistic instinct . Davis also discovered that " cubism allowed you to form the concept of the object as you saw it from different views . " When he had absorbed the show , he knew what direction he would take : " I would be a modern artist . So easy . Except for one small matter : How ? " <P> A Ballet Set to Jazz . Like so many other young men in the arts , he plunged into experiment . " I 'd cut things out of pressed wood and fasten bolts and locks onto them . In New Mexico I painted tin cans in a more or less naturalistic way-that was a gesture against the romantic idea of natural beauty . And on the docks in Gloucester , I remember doing a collage with pieces of cotton and a button sewed on the canvas and a piece of tin . " Finally , in 1927 , he " nailed a rubber glove , an electric fan and an egg beater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stuck with that single subject for a whole year . " <P> In doing the egg beater over and over again , Davis was able to explore , distort and transform the objects into endless arrangements on the canvas . This meant that though his inspiration might come from the object , he was not imprisoned by it . Davis ' paintings became ballets of what he called " color-spaces , " but the beat of the ballets was always jazz . What caught his imagination was everyday America-the gas pumps , factories , cities , the hep talk and hip music-even the signs , " the visual dialect of the city . " Since he never lost touch with reality , Davis refuses to be called abstract . His color-spaces are merely " a language to express daily observations . "
