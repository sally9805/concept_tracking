SOMETHING TO ANSWER FOR by P. H. Newby . 285 pages . J. 8 . Lippincott. $5.95 . <P> What tortures a P. H. Newby hero goes through ! In real life Newby is the gentlemanly chief of the BBC 's gentlemanly Third Programme ; in his fiction he is committed to the notion that a novelist 's job is to beat the truth out of his characters . With an author like him , a novel has no need of villains . <P> Something to Answer For finds Newby at his often brilliant but racking best . If the reader does not mind getting his lumps , he will also come in for a fair share of illumination-along with Townrow , Newby 's latest punching bag . <P> Townrow is not undeserving of his fate . A failed theological student , a failed husband , he wears the dank , damned look of a Graham Greene reject . His main achievement in 35 years has been to embezzle money from a charity fund dedicated to the memory of drowned Boy Scouts . With modest accuracy , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lechery and disloyalty . " <P> It is the spasm of dishonesty that brings him back to Egypt , where he had served as a soldier in World War II . Officially , Townrow is there to help arrange the affairs of an elderly widow , assuming an altruistic role as the dead husband 's best friend . But being Townrow , he keeps a twitching eye out for a piece of the estate . <P> At that point , Newby and his brass knuckles take over . He has thoughtfully managed Townrow 's arrival to coincide with the Suez crisis of 1956 . His first night in Port Said , Townrow is robbed of all his clothes , beaten up and left in the desert . After that he moves in a " neverending daze , " not much surer of who he is than everybody else . <P> The Egyptians suspect Townrow of being a British agent , and at times he wonders what 's up himself . A love affair with a Jewess named Leah only further confuses him-Newby is not about to leave him so easy an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mob and jailed . In between disasters he is plagued by bad dreams and a virus with a 102 fever . <P> What is Newby up to with this trial by ordeal ? Alone in an alien and hostile land , Townrow is stripped naked , first physically , then spiritually . Eventually , he runs out of roles to play . Peeled of all his masks , Townrow is destroyed in order that he may come to life . <P> Rebirth with Newby is no hallelujah experience . It means confronting and finally answering the question that one 's particular destiny has been asking from the beginning . At the end , Townrow lives out the dream that has haunted him from the opening page . Like a saintly pilgrim , he sets off across Port Said harbor in a small boat , ferrying the coffin of the dead man whose estate he came to plunder , and then moves out to sea in search of an absolute emptiness in which to find himself . <P> Tough-minded as a Greek tragedian , Newby hits a poor anti-hero with every thunderbolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary sadist is the confidence he conveys to the reader that Townrow , like men generally , has what it takes for bare survival .
