KING COHN by Bob Thomas . 381 pages . Putnam. $6.95 . <P> <P> Gazing at the miles of neighboring urban sprawl and walking through the TV treadmills of Desilu and Warner 's , the casual visitor to Hollywood will find it difficult to believe that it was once the habitat of Cro-Magnon man . His name was Harry Cohn , president and production head at Columbia Studios , and he flourished during the movies ' Pleistocene epoch-circa A.D. 1930-58-subsisting on the backbones of executives and the egos of movie stars . When he died in 1958 , more than 2,000 people turned out for his funeral , prompting Red Skelton to compose the most quoted epitaph in movie history : " It only proves what they always say-give the public something they want to see and they 'll come out for it . " <P> After Cohn 's funeral , other obituaries were added : " He was a song plugger and a louse , " said Comedian Lou Holtz . " He never learned how to live , " said Samuel Goldwyn . " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a bitch . " <P> Wide Screen . Clearly , a man who can inspire such passion needs a tough-minded and sensitive biographer ; instead he has Bob Thomas , 45 , Hollywood reporter for the Associated Press , whose prose style seems derived largely from the wide-screen Hollywood novels of Harold Robbins . Nevertheless , Cohn was one of the last of the great movie despots , in whom absolute power and abysmal ignorance were fused , and he left behind a body of anecdotes that are worth examination . <P> At a writers ' conference , for example , Cohn once bawled out his staff for creating an anachronism in an Arabian Nights fantasy . " It 's all through this script , goddammit ! " he complained . " You 've got ' em all saying ' Yes , siree . ' " The producer read the offending page on Cohn 's desk . " But , Harry , " he explained , " that 's ' Yes , sire . ' " <P> In a more benign mood , he once wooed a prospective screenwriter : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sleep with your wife any more ? You 're crazy about a starlet ? I 'll let you take her down to Stage Eight , and I 'll stand outside and guard the door . " <P> When he found that his first wife could not have a baby , he selected a minor actress , had her struck from the payroll , then came to her apartment with an offer that rivals Rumpelstilts-kin 's : " I would like you to have a child by me . On the day you are certified to be pregnant , I will put $75,000 in a bank under your name . On the day the child is delivered to me , our relationship is over . . . " The proposal was turned down . Cohn restored the girl to her job-and never spoke to her again . <P> It was not the first time that the <P> King 's edicts were defied . He was surrounded by jesters , many of them devastating . Once , at the climax of a dressing down , an alcoholic actor , Warren Hymer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Columbia . The desk was burned . <P>
