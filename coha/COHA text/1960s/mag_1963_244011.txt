At the formal opening of the Manila meeting last week , Philippines President Diosdado Macapagal heaped praise upon his two guests . He hailed Indonesia 's fun-loving President Sukarno as a " great leader " and paid tribute to the " stabilizing influence in Asia " of Malaya 's Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman , who hopes , on Aug. 31 , to preside over the birth of Malaysia , a merger of Malaya with Singapore , Sarawak and North Borneo . Macapagal went on : " The question in the minds of many is , ' Will this conference succeed- ? ' " At that moment the power failed , out went the lights , off went the microphones and air conditioning . It looked like a sign . <P> Referendum Demand . At first the three leaders seemed to ignore ill omens . Next morning at Malacanang Palace , Sukarno said he had gone to bed early . Then he winked , " But that does n't mean I went to sleep early . " Macapagal and the Tunku roared with laughter . Getting down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loose association of the future Malaysia , the Philippines and Indonesia , to be known , by syllabic fusion , as Maphilindo . But then came the blow from Sukarno , who has long opposed Malaysia , has only lately and reluctantly accepted the idea . Sukarno insisted on a full-scale referendum in Sarawak and North Borneo before Malaysia comes into existence , to " ascertain " whether these territories really want the federation . They plainly do , but Sukarno just wanted to throw his weight around . He was supported , halfheartedly , by Macapagal , since the Philippines has a shadowy legal claim to certain parts of North Borneo and a referendum would offer a face-saving way of abandoning the claim . <P> The man who was supposed to do the ascertaining , the U.N . ' s already overburdened Secretary-General U Thant , was also thinking in terms of a referendum , which would take at least four weeks and might require a mandate from the General Assembly . All this could push the Malaysia timetable from late August until November . The British government applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bluntly that they were pulling their troops out of Sarawak and North Borneo on schedule , thereby opening both territories to possible Indonesian infiltration and terrorism . <P> Blithe Unconcern . By week 's end tempers were rising in Manila . The Tunku pointedly reminded Sukarno that he had taken over West Irian without a plebiscite and that the legislatures of North Borneo and Sarawak had passed resolutions in favor of the new federation . No man to be troubled by inconsistencies , Sukarno nevertheless demanded his referendum . Only the soothing presence of Macapagal prevented a walkout by the Tunku . <P> Failing to reach a decision , the meeting went on into this week , with indications that a compromise might emerge . U Thant was reported ready to visit the Borneo territories , without waiting for General Assembly approval , and prepared to make his " ascertainment " without a formal referendum . Sukarno , switching from intransigence to blithe unconcern , took time off to collect an honorary degree ( his 21st ) from the University of the Philippines , to pursue a pretty Malayan correspondent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a sort of static Indonesian twist .
