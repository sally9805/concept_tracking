Nikita Khrushchev kept pushing his brand of consumer Communism . " We did not make a revolution so that we should live worse , " he observed on the stump in Hungary . " Some people say , ' You already have one pair of trousers , and they cover everything trousers should . ' To this I reply that trousers cover the sinful body , but that is not enough . Perhaps one pair of trousers suffices in the tropics . It does n't in our country : something might freeze . " <P> Back home , on the chilly banks of the Neva in Leningrad , plenty of bodies were uncovered as swarms of pale , fleshy Russians looked for a place in the thin spring sun , the very image of a people who want the better , freer-and more stylish-life Khrushchev promises . Sounding downright capitalistic , Izvestia launched a new plan to bring about this longed-for prosperity ; it suggested putting a traditional Russian drink known as kvas on the world mar ket to compete with Coca-Cola. * <P> The Culprit Among Us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound up his ten-day visit to Hungary by again and again hitting his main theme : that the primary aim of the Communist revolution is achieving a prosperous Communism without resorting to nuclear war .

" When it is a question of their own lives , " he said , " the imperialists take things very seriously . " <P> Of course the imperialists are still the enemy , but Peking , with its " despotism , " " frantic slanders " and " chauvinism , " is only giving them aid and comfort .
