txt  | only available metals for tools , weapons , and springs , each piece had a slightly different carbon content , enough to affect its hardening qualities . Even later , when modern methods for producing tool steel were developed , it was impossible to produce steel to absolute specifications from one smelting to the other . Accordingly , smiths approach hardening and tempering warily . Some tool steel hardens at a cherry-red color , and other steels require orange-red or even white heat before hardening . While the old-time smith did not have any chemical laboratory or elaborate testing equipment to determine the proper hardening heat , the conscientious smith did test whenever possible before tempering . The test is simple , its effectiveness determined by the smith 's eye and experience . A thin piece of the steel being worked is heated in the forge so that the end becomes white hot , with the color varying from this end toward the other end through orange-red , cherry red , sunrise red , dull red , and gray . The smith must keep in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After the end has become white hot the steel is quenched in brine and is laid across the anvil face , its end projecting 1/4 inch over the edge . With a light hammer the smith breaks off the brittle end and examines the texture of the inside . Usually the end shows a very coarse texture when broken , indicating that the steel was burned somewhat by the white heat , and is therefore inferior at that point . Other chips are broken off and examined until the broken end shows very close texture , indicating proper hardening . Remembering which heat was shown at this particular point , the smith uses the same heat to harden the tool or weapon on which he is working . Testing for the proper tempering heat is very similar to testing for hardening . The same test sliver of steel is hardened at the heat found suitable , then cleaned of all oxide with a  | file until it shines . Again one end of it is placed in the fire until it turns gray with oxide , and again it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be seen to have been transformed by the heat into a rainbow of color between the gray scale and the still-shining end away from the fire . Next to the scale it is a deep irridescent purple , and , next to that , blue in varying shades , then brown , then yellow , until a very light yellow shows the extent to which the heat traveled up the hardened steel . Proper tempering color is determined with a small file , somewhat worn . Of course , the shiny portion is still at maximum hardness , and this hardness is dissipated through the range of colors to the oxide , which will be soft and malleable , capable of being bent without breaking . As the file tests the various colors , the smith guages its degree of hardness . Coldchisel edges should have only a slight degree of hardness drawn from them . Saws and carving tools for soft wood should be tempered to a point that they are almost malleable , just hard enough to retain a good edge when honed . Razors and springs require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brittleness , and maximum softness . The smith determines the proper color for tempering whatever he is working on by how deeply the file bites when it is run across the metal . Only delicate senses trained by experience can make this determination with accuracy . While each piece of steel tempers differently , there are some general rules that tell the relationship between color and proper temper for various classes of steel use . Spon 's Mechanics Own Book , an instructional trade book published in London around the turn of the century , provides a table based on color which is as accurate as any table , but which can not substitute for the need to test each separate piece of steel being worked . Here is Mr. Spon 's table :  | Table There are other ingenious methods for tempering developed over the ages , methods that do not depend on a good eye for color . One tested way of tempering gun springs is to coat the spring after hardening with soot from a burning pine splinter . When covered , the spring is held over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant the last vestige of soot disappears the spring is quenched in oil . Still another method of tempering springs is to sprinkle sawdust on the oil-quenched spring after it has been hardened . When the sawdust burns over the fire the spring is quenched again . The process is repeated twice more . After the third quenching the spring is properly tempered . In recent times the proper hardening color may be realized by touching the steel with a small magnet as the heat rises . The magnet will stick until the metal reaches a red heat . At the exact moment that the magnet ceases to stick the steel should be quenched for maximum hardness . Large pieces can be tempered on the forge , but only after  | the fire is flattened into a bed . During forge tempering the bellows are generally immobile , the fire retaining enough heat without blowing for the time necessary to temper . Small pieces are usually tempered by laying the piece on a bar or plate which has been heated orange-red in the forge . Some smiths temper knives by holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the bar heats the blunt back to a blue , the cutting edge has turned dark yellow , and at this point the knife blade is quenched . This gives it a hard edge and a springy blade . Some technique is required even in quenching . The steel is immersed in the brine and is moved around in the liquid vigorously until cool , the purpose being to bring it continually into contact with cold brine and to avoid a concentration of air bubbles , which can cause uneven temper or hardness . Large , thin objects such as swords and scissors are never quenched by immersion from the point , but always by immersing them along the cutting edge . Otherwise the progressive cooling of the metal as it is thrust in the brine will sometimes warp the blade , requiring straightening before attempting to harden once more . Anvil faces are hardened under a stream of falling water , which quickly carries away the tremendous heat held by such a huge mass of metal . In some shops warm water that has been standing , and thereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempering bath than brine . Often tool hardening and tempering may be done in one operation , though some old-time smiths frowned on this economy , saying that the results were uneven . Tools such as chisels are brought to hardening heat on the end , then the edge is quenched % inch in the brine until it has cooled . The chisel rests on the anvil while a section of the edge is quickly shined with a flat piece of sandstone or a small file . The heat remaining in the part that has not been quenched then spreads  | Figure or runs down to the edge . When enough heat reaches the edge to give it the desired tempering color , the whole tool is immersed in the brine bath . It should be reiterated that much of the fascination of the olden blacksmith 's techniques lies in the fact that these 154  | techniques can not be limited by number or description . Each smith , learning his art by word of mouth , observation , and experience , was continually adapting observed techniques to new uses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past experience . As a consequence , it is impossible to set down fully all the techniques used by all the smiths even in a limited area over a limited period of time . Each smith 's techniques varied according to his experience , his equipment , his inherent intelligence , his powers of visualization and analysis , and his own personal characteristics . The blacksmith was not a machine , he was a man meeting the challenges and glories of each new day in his own individual manner . Because of this , most smiths were happy men .  | THE TECHNIQUES OF TOOL MAKING Smithing has ever been a functional art . Back in the dim reaches of the prehistoric past , when the first forges were built , the world was a hard place in which to live . One never knew when to expect a band of strangers , queerly clothed and queerly armed , bent on stealing one 's women , killing one 's cattle , and trampling one 's laboriously planted grain . The elements , and man 's hunger and his puny body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed for food and clothing . Shelter had to be built to protect against the snow and wind and rain . Man might have survived with his hands alone , but they were barely adequate . Tools gave him his place of mastery in the hostile world . The blacksmith gave him the best tools he would have for many a thousand years , tools made especially for his peculiar needs , tools that gave his puny arms and hands titanic power . The smith himself needed tools before he could purvey his art to his community . Unlike the other craftsmen , he made his own tools , as well as theirs , and in many cases his tools remained essentially unchanged , certainly in principle , from the very beginning of the art . For instance , the smith 's tongs served the same purpose in A.D. 1900 as they had in 4000 B.C. , and probably retained the same forms . Hammers serve the same function today as they did when man first used a coup de poing of hard stone , and have changed in form only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an inserted handle , and even this was found among the quite primitive societies of the earliest users of iron . All hammers have the same basic form . Each consists of a bar of iron or steel with a hole in it to receive a handle . From that beginning it can be modified to many uses , both for the smith and for his fellow craftsmen such as carpenters , silversmiths , machinists , and others . There is a cardinal rule with few exceptions that applies to making hammers as well as to other pierced tools . The hole is made first and all else is formed around the hole . Whenever possible the smith forms his hammer at the end of a bar long enough to hold in the hand , thus circumventing the need for tongs until the final stages of manufacture . The making of a simple cross-pein hammer is typical of the process . Depending on the size of the hammer being made , an iron bar %-inch to 2-inches square is heated to a bright red , and the eye is punched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly in the middle . The usual oval shape of the eye results from dressing the bulges caused by a round punch being driven through a square bar . The bulges are hammered at an even cherry red heat until flush with the sides of the bar . Next the hole is drifted out with an oval drift . Often the drift is left in the eye until the hammer is finished , to prevent a poorly aimed blow from ruining its symmetry . If the hammer is to be made the old way , of iron with a steel face , the second step in manufacturing is to weld on the face . Generally the face is a flat piece of carbon steel about 1/z - inch thick . If a bar of steel is used the end is brought to welding heat before cutting it , while at the same time the iron bar with its punched hole is also brought to welding heat . When hot enough the two pieces are joined , and the thick bar for the head is butt-welded to the flat steel . Before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut off from the iron with a hot chisel , and the smith can hammer the edges of the steel to fit the dimensions of the iron . Sometimes a piece of steel slightly smaller than the intended face is used . The steel is first cut with a chisel once or twice on the corner of each of its four sides to form small teeth which are hammered out until they are perpendicular to the face . When cool the face is driven , teeth down , into the white-hot end of the hammer head . Thus the face is held in position while welding . Next the fuller is used to dent the bar on each corner about an inch from the hole on either side . Then the corners on the face side of the hole are champfered , or beveled , from the dent to the face itself .  | At this time the drift is knocked out , the bar is heated to orange-red and cut off , either with chisel or hardie , about 11/2 inches from the hole . For this the smith uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the eye , to hold the short , blunt piece of iron steadily while the pein is shaped . This may be done in several ways . One is to reduce the thickness of the bar with the fuller , then smooth it with hammer and flatter . Another is to draw it out to its wedge shape over the horn of the anvil , turning the iron over every two or three blows to assure an even reduction on both sides . Following this , the smith can mold the pein with the cross pein of the hammer he is using , holding the red-hot iron across the anvil face in a position that allows his hammer to glance off the pein of the hammer he is making and yet miss the corner of the anvil . When the pein is to be used for hard work , a thin piece of steel is bent and welded around its outside surface , or the edge of the pein is split and a small bar of steel welded in the split . After this the pein is dressed with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tempering is simple . First the whole head is heated to about a cherry red and the face is quenched . Withdrawing it from the brine , the smith polishes a small spot on face and pein edge . When enough heat from the body of the hammer reaches face and pein to turn the spot a light straw yellow , then the whole head is dipped into the brine bath and the hammer is ready for use . By following this general technique the smith can shape his hammers as he wishes for any special purpose . Handled set tools are made in essentially the same manner . Whenever an old-time smith was called upon to make a heavy hammer and he found that he had no heavy iron bar in stock , he improvised his basic iron from what was available . For instance , a bar thick enough to make a 6-pound sledge  | Figure can be made by bending a 2-inch strip of wagon tire in an accordion fold and welding the enfolded surfaces together . For making small tack hammers out of 1/2-inch-square stock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point where the eye will be punched , to provide better support for the handle . Ball-pein hammers are usually made from 1- to 1 %-inch round rods . The same basic technique is used as in making other hammers , except that the fuller is used to draw out the metal between the cylindrical face section and the eye and between the eye and the pein . Then , with the drift still in the eye , the sides surrounding the eye are flattened to extend the vertical inside surface for better support for the handle . Claw hammers were made by the smith for the carpenters of his community since nails were first invented in prehistoric times . Until the beginning of the nineteenth century , American and Western European carpenters had claw hammers almost identical to those of the Romans . Early in that industrial century , in 1840 , the adz-eye claw hammer was  | Figure invented by an American blacksmith , David Maydole , of Norwich , New York . Maydole found such demand for his new hammer that he started a hammer factory and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the  | Figure adz-eye hammer is so named because the eye , into which the handle is inserted , is formed as the long eye of a hand or foot adz . The advantages of the adz eye on claw hammers are selfevident . The longer eye gives good support for the handle when drawing nails with the claw , and keeps the handle properly aligned for driving nails straight . Also it eliminates the need to weld to the hammerhead iron straps that extend down the handle , fastened to the wood with screws , to keep the head tightly in position . Not only do the straps require some rather delicate welding , but they also take the spring out of the handle , making it less efficient as a driving tool . Adz-eye hammers , which generally have rectangular eyes , are made from a rectangular bar % inch by 1% inches , punched through the wider dimension with a %-inch-by-% - inch punch . After that the face end and claw end are drawn out and shaped . The claws are made by splitting the pein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claws around the anvil horn . With the drift still in the eye , the outside surface of the eye is drawn out to a sleeve to support the handle . Tempering , of course , is the last step . The face must be tempered to straw color , the claws to purple .  | Figure In many early hammers , however , the boss for the adz-eye was formed by welding a piece to the square bar before punching . Until the 1870s , before the advent of widespread mass production , each smith made his own tongs . While simple in shape and operation , it usually takes at least an hour to make a pair of tongs , and some complicated designs take longer . Tongs designed for a special purpose , however , could save many days ' time and much frustration over the years . Most smiths seem to prefer making tongs from four separate pieces of iron , instead of only two pieces as the uninitiated may conjecture . Generally the bits , or jaws , are  | made of two short pieces which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of smaller diameter than 1/2 inch , are made separately and are welded to the bits as the next-tolast step of manufacture , welding being easier and quicker than drawing out the original rod to a suitable thickness for handles . Tong bits are made from % to %-inch iron bar about 6 inches long , sometimes longer , sometimes shorter , depending on the type desired . The bar is first offset for 1 to 3 inches on one end to form the jaw . Next the bar is again offset below the jaws on a plane perpendicular to the jaw , to form the pivot section . Below the pivot the bar is drawn out , rounded and scarfed in preparation for welding to the handle , or rein . After that a %-inch hole is punched or drilled through the center for the rivet . Jaws may then be shaped appropriately for the intended use . Each part of a pair of tongs is made identical to the other . Care should be taken to keep the pivot sections thick enough to hold up under years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For arched jaws , however , which are found on many tongs , the metal is the same 1/4-inch thickness from shoulder to tip , but is further drawn out to % - inch width . Next a hole is punched for the rivet . The tips of the jaws are then bent at right angles to the long axis of the bit 1 inch from the end , and the jaws are curved almost round from the hole to the right-angle bend . A curve in the opposite direction is made below the hole to the handle butt . After that the handles are welded on and the joint is smoothed , either with a light hammer used as the joint is rotated back and forth on the anvil , or with a round swage . Many tongs have special jaws or lips . One of the most common has lips shaped at a right angle on the long axis , a shape that will securely hold both square and round rods . With patience such lips can be shaped on the corner of the anvil . In a well-equipped shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square swage , or swage block , and a cross- or straight-pein hammer may be used as the top  | Figure swage . Round-lipped tongs can be formed with the swage block , or lower round swage of appropriate size , and with a round rod of the proper dimension for the top swage . One caution should be observed in forming tongs . The shoulder between the jaw and the pivot must always be scarfed , never squared . Because of strain when the tongs are closed , square shoulders tend to break after relatively little use . Often a smith needs a punch of a size unavailable among his equipment . If he plans to punch only one or two holes he may use a handy rod of the correct size , even though it is of soft iron . Usually , though , he makes himself a set of punches of various sizes , all made as carefully as his chisels . Both punches and chisels require the same general technique , and both are tempered . Set chisels and punches are started as hammers are started . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bit and butt are formed . For rodded tools , the tool is formed first and  | a groove is formed with the fuller around the body as the last operation before tempering . All of this is relatively simple for a good smith . The secret of making punches and chisels durable and effective , however , is packing . Some smiths know the secret ; others never learn and as a consequence spend untold hours re-dressing chisels and punches after almost every job . Before packing , the punch or chisel bit must be shaped under a cherry-red heat . Since packing spreads the edge of a chisel somewhat , initial shaping should take this into consideration , and vertical-side surfaces should be slightly beveled toward the edge . Packing is exactly what its name implies . It is a technique whereby the fibers of the carbon steel are packed tightly with hammerblows to provide an extra degree of density to the chisel or punch point . The color is important for packing ( or tamping ) . It should be a sunrise red , barely discernible in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So important is the color that the wise smith checks it by thrusting the iron into a dark chamber , a small keg or box placed near the forge , so that the color can be judged more accurately . If the metal is too hot it will not pack . If too cold , it may crystallize and break . Actual packing is done with a light hammer , usually ball pein , about 11/2 pounds in weight . When the chisel edge attains sunrise red in the forge it is taken out and is laid across the horn , or on the anvil face next to its rounded corner . It is struck rapidly with the hammer at one point on the anvil , the smith turning it from one side to the other while he draws it toward him under the blows . This is continued until all red disappears and hammering is stopped . On chisels , the last three hammer blows are important . One should be placed on either side of the edge and the last placed in the middle of the edge at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range the fibers so as to prevent the chisel edge from breaking in a crescent shape in later use . Packing punches is only . slightly different from packing chisels . Instead of turning a punch from side to side , it is rotated back and forth under the hammer on the anvil face . The last three blows on punches must be spaced equidistant around the circumference near the point . After packing , chisels and punches are hardened and tempered to a straw yellow . The packing is not affected by high heats and can only be altered by heating to an orangered and giving the piece a sharp tap on its blunt end . Wood chisels are formed much like metal chisels , except that wood chisels have wooden handles . For this reason a wood chisel is either drawn out to a tang , formed next to a wide shoulder , or the butt end of the chisel is formed and welded into a conical socket in which a wooden handle is inserted . Wood chisels hold up better if packed .  | Figure In making anvil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being the drawing out and shaping of the square shank that fits into the hardie hole on the anvil . This is always shaped first , whether making a hardie , a beak , a leaf tool , or a larger swage . Of course , the fuller is used to draw out the shank and shoulders are dressed with the set hammer . After forming the shank , hardies are made exactly like any other chisel , including packing and tempering . Swages are made of a square tool-steel bar . After the shank is drawn out to proper size for the hardie hole , the opposite end of the bar is brought almost to welding heat , the shank is placed in the hardie hole , and the hot end is upset with a heavy hammer . The partially formed swage is then taken from the hardie hole and its edges are dressed . Then using a rod , fuller , or square bar , the depression of the swage face is formed . The last steps are to level the face with a set hammer or flatter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shank of a swage are made separately , and the  | shank is butt-welded to the center of the bottom of the swage face . One of the most useful tools for metalworkers down through the ages is the file . This instrument is mentioned in the First Book of Samuel . It is essential for smoothing and shaping iron into intricate forms . Files have long been made in every size and shape and degree of fineness , and until satisfactory file-cutting machines were perfected in Europe and America in the late nineteenth century , a truly infinite variety was available over the world . Early in history file cutting became a specialty , requiring a steady hand , a good eye , and a delicate touch . Nevertheless , the production of files was often found within the province of the village blacksmith in isolated communities all over the world . Since file teeth are cut into the blank with a chisel or Figure  | punch in the days of hand manufacture , the file maker carefully anneals his blanks by heating them to cherry red , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assure maximum malleability before cutting . Historically , and currently , files are made from smooth bars or blanks , of carbon steel or cast steel , the smoothing being done early in history with flatters , then by rolling after the seventeenth century , and after about 1800 sometimes by planing on a milling machine . Round , square , triangular , and half-round file blanks were formed with swages before the advent of rolling mills . Before the teeth are cut , a tang is forged at one end of the blank , and further smoothness is attained by grinding and filing with a fine file after annealing , to remove the oxide and level any minute rough spots . The equipment needed for cutting the teeth is specialized but simple . First of all , there is a lead block with molded depressions fitted to various types and sizes of file blanks . This sits on the workbench , and the blank is held in the proper place with a leather strap at each end , which reaches through holes in the bench and is attached to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the file maker holds the straps taut . The tang always points to the file cutter . Also , the blank is lightly oiled before being placed on the block . Actual cutting of teeth is done with a short rigid chisel and a peculiarly shaped hammer with an oblique face and a crooked handle . For cutting rough files the smith employs a 7- or 8-pound hammer . Very fine files are cut with a hammer weighing only 1 or 2 ounces . File making , as with any craft , had its own terminology . " Overcutting " describes forming the first row of diagonal ridges or teeth , while " upcutting " describes the second cut , which provides a crosshatched surface on mill files and small finishing files .  | Figure Cutting begins at the heel of the file . Holding the chisel at about a 60-degree angle to the blank , the cutter strikes the chisel a firm blow , which leaves a ragged diagonal ridge in the blank . Using this as a guide for the next blow , he continues his cutting down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His skill is reflected in the even angle of his cuts and the even force of each hammerblow . As the series of blows on one side of the blank will curve it slightly , the cutter must straighten his blank with a wooden or lead mallet on a lead anvil before turning it over to cut the reverse side . Rasps , of course , are cut with a half-round punch instead of a chisel . Perhaps the most delicate operation in file making is tempering the finished file without destroying the cutting edges of the teeth by oxidation . This is accomplished by using a paste made of yeast , or tallow , or other soft organic material such as bread dough .  | Nearly every file maker in the old days had his own secret formula for this paste . After drawing the file through this mixture the sticky surface should be liberally sprinkled with salt or borax , or even clean sand , as a flux . Ancient file makers often mixed roasted and crushed animal hoofs in with the flux , thinking that the carbon in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempering process . Once thoroughly coated , the file is slowly heated to a cherry red , either on a flat fire in the forge or in a container of molten lead . It is then quenched in brine to harden . Residue of the paste is removed by scrubbing with diluted muriatic acid and sand . After this the file is soaked in limewater to help prevent rust . New files are tested on a prover , a small piece of hardened steel . One of the first tools made by emerging mankind was the knife . The most primitive tribes throughout history all had some sort of knife , usually made of flaked stone , but sometimes devised of a razor-sharp splint of reed or bamboo . The blacksmiths of prehistoric times probably made more knives than any other tool , and knife making has been important all through history . Herbert Mitchum , a smith in the unincorporated community of Durand , Greene County , Georgia , continued the tradition by producing a number of heavy knives for soldiers from his area who fought in World War H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen as it was in its many shop forms during the era of handicraftsmanship , is not quite so easy to make as it may seem on the surface . Of course , all knives ? butcher knives , drawknives , pocketknives , and specialized forms such as plane irons ? are made of .75 carbon steel . Some forms of knives are forged in one flat piece , the flat shank being punched so that wooden or bone or horn handles can be bradded on . Others may have a thin tang , such as a file 's , forged to fit a solid handle with a hole bored through its length . Blades can be shaped any  | number of ways for various uses . The general technique for forging all knives , however , is similar . When a tang is wanted , this is forged first , and for fancy carving knives a small button is then upset between the blade and the tang . Forming this button is a rather delicate operation done with a monkey tool or a bar with a hole through which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be formed during upsetting . The chamfered shoulder or the blade side of the button is formed with a fuller on the horn of the anvil . After that the blade is drawn out in rough form and cut diagonally to form a rough point . Next the width of the blade is curved over the horn , making the intended edge slightly concave . Rolling blows above the round corner of the anvil face both thin the edge and extend its length so that the concavity of the edge is straightened . As best he can , the smith shapes the point to fit his preconceived design , then smooths the blade with his flatter , again working over the rounded corner of the anvil face . The shape is finished with a file . In forging any thin piece such as a knife blade the smith must be careful to lay on his hammerblows evenly . Otherwise the blade will warp when being tempered . Heavy hunting knives sometimes require a blood gutter , or flute , down the length of the blade . Fluting is done with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed on the bottom fuller and the top fuller being placed directly over the bottom before being struck by the helper . A smith must be particularly careful in heating a knife ( luring forging . The steel is forged at cherry-red heat , but once the edge is formed great caution must be met lest the paper-thin edge overheat and burn . Once this happens , always when the knife is nearly completed , the steel is ruined and the unfinished knife must be discarded . Equal care must be taken in hardening knives , especially  | Figure for thin blades . After being heated to cherry red , the blade must be immersed in brine edge-down , with the blade exactly perpendicular to the surface of the brine . This prevents air bubbles from collecting on one side of the blade , making cooling uneven and causing the blade to warp . Tangs should be hardened with the blade . In drawing the temper the smith may employ either a heated flat bar of iron or a large soldering iron . The bar is brought to an orange-red . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being off the edge of the bar . As the blunt back of the blade turns straw color , then yellow , then purple , the heat spreads slowly toward the edge . Quenching is done when the edge is straw yellow . Generally the back will be purple or blue at this point . When a heavy soldering iron is used , it is heated to a dull red and laid along the back of the blade until the heat runs through the blade as described above . On knives with thin tangs the smith must be careful that the tang is soft . Unless the temper in this thin portion is drawn out at least to a purple , there is an excellent chance  | that it will break off while the handle is being installed . The handle is secured by bradding the end of the tang over a punchplate the shape of the cross section of the handle . For flat-shanked knives with two-piece handles , the handle may be bradded on with iron , brass , or copper brads . Knife blades can be finished to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn , held across the blade by both hands and rubbed the length of the blade until all rough spots are cut smooth . Hunting knives often require a handguard between the handle and the blade . This is no more than a thin bar of iron punched to fit the tang and placed in position before the handle is put on . Knives are a pleasure to make . The smith can easily see the result of each of his hammerblows as he draws the hot steel toward him across the anvil face . When he gets to the point of thinning the edge , the blade curves gracefully , as if by magic and the smith feels himself a detached observer as he succumbs to the regular , hypnotic beat . Then , when forging is done and the blade is clamped in the bench vise , the file carves the final shape , sharpens the edge , forms the back and the point , and leaves a thing of graceful beauty . Clasp knives are more difficult to make , having a number of separate parts which must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is forged as any other knife blade , except that it has no tang , only a butt which is drilled for a pivot pin and formed with a notch to hold the blade rigid . Max Segal , master smith from Philadelphia , states that the thumb nail groove for opening is made with a half-round file while the blade is bent . It then is straightened and tempered . Frames for clasp knives can be of several designs . The simplest is merely two pieces of sheet iron , perhaps an %-inch thick , shaped as desired to fit the hand . It is drilled with small holes in appropriate spots to pin the blade and spring  | Figure into position and to brad on a wooden or a bone handle . Some frames , the better ones for that matter , are forged from 1/4 - inch bar , drawn down from a boss , through which the blade pin is inserted , to %6-inch thickness , where the handle fits . This design gives much more strength to the pivot pin and , consequently , longevity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frame , to which they are riveted . For single-blade knives the spring must be curved to fit the butt end of the handle ; for multiblade knives they fit only along the back of the handle . For any type of clasp knife , the spring must be riveted in at least two points . From ancient time until about World War I , any farm or carpenter shop had a drawknife as a fundamental piece of equipment . After 1950 they were seldom even displayed in hardware stores , and they are unidentifiable to a majority of the population . Because of their many uses drawknives were one of the more common tools made by the blacksmith before factory-made hand tools became common . In early days drawknives , as with many other cutting tools , were made of wrought iron with a thin strip of carbon steel welded onto the blade . After welding , the blade is thinned along its edge , as with any knife , and the resulting curve is straightened by drawing out the back to a steeper bevel . Tangs are then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 3-inches long . After that the blade is tempered , its edge to a straw yellow and its back to purple or dark blue . Now the tangs must be extended at right angles to the blade so that handles can be applied . This is done by welding . The tempered blade is wrapped in wet cloth to keep it cool , and the tang and its intended extension are brought to welding heat after being scarfed on their ends . Usually the handle extension is cross-welded to the tang , though it might be lapwelded and later bent to its right-angle position . Wooden handles , bored through their length , are driven on the tangs , and the end of tang is either bradded through washers or clinched over the wood . There was another form of shaving knife supplied by the olden blacksmith , the plane iron . Up until the beginning of the twentieth century most carpenters , and all cabinet and coach makers , sometimes required as many as a hundred different planes for their work . Some were round and some were hollow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very elaborate moldings . All of them , before 1870 , con-Figure  | sisted of a hard wooden stock into which the iron was wedged into position . Irons were ordered from the blacksmith . A plane iron is no more than a flat strip of iron faced with steel with a beveled cutting edge ground to about a 60-degree angle . When designed to cut molding they were shaped on the cutting edge to fit the molding desired . Though simple in design , plane irons were not easily made , especially before 1860 , after which carbon steel was abundant and the plane iron could have been forged of solid steel . Before 1860 they were usually made of wrought iron with a thin steel strip welded to the iron . Because thin strips of carbon steel burn easily the smith must be extraordinarily careful to watch the steel as it is brought slowly to welding heat . The steel must be slightly smaller and thicker than the iron back . Its edges will become coincident to the iron when hammered . Since small iron cools quickly when taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces in position for hammering before welding heat is lost , it is well to clamp the wrought-iron bar and the steel together with tongs secured with a tong ring . They are placed in the fire with the steel uppermost to allow the iron to reach its higher welding heat at the same time the thin steel reaches its own welding heat . When brought to welding heat , the two are taken from the fire together and quickly joined . After welding , the iron is dressed into shape , packed as with a chisel , and tempered to a straw yellow . Sometimes the smith will feel it necessary to file his plane iron smooth after tempering . Back in the days when 90 percent of Americans and almost as many Europeans were farmers , every farm needed axes and adzes . In America the frontier required that peculiarly American tool , the tomahawk , both for hunters and for the Indian trade . Each of these tools might be found in a va-  | riety of shapes for a number of different uses . All , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1870 , usually the body of each was made of iron with a steel blade welded to the iron . Tomahawks were made in different designs by English , French , Spanish , Belgian , and American smiths from the time America was colonized until the last of the free Indians around 1880 . They generally maintained the form of the ancient Saxon ax and the Norse ax of prehistoric time , a form carried down through the ages with the eighteenth-century English and German felling ax and still seen in factory-made felling axes used in South America in the latter half of the twentieth century . In design they are quite simple , merely the result of wrapping a strip of iron around a rod to form an eye and welding the double strip together before finishing . The smiths who made them for the Indian trade up until 1880 undoubtedly duplicated the technique of long-dead smiths whose helpers trod upon the wineskin . Usually the eye of a tomahawk is formed by bending an orange-red strip of iron some 11/2-inches wide and 1/4 - inch Figure  | thick around a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole of the anvil . If a perfectly round eye is desired the smith must first bend his iron at right angles in two places , the length between the two bends being equal to the circumference of the upright rod . This insures a tight seam where the strip meets after forming the eye . Next the iron is welded for about 2 inches from the eye , leaving 1/4 inch on the end , which is not welded . The unwelded portion is then scarfed and , after scarfing , is separated with a hot chisel to receive the steel . The easiest way of welding the steel bit to the iron head is to clamp the steel in position before bringing the two pieces to welding heat . This is done by scarfing the steel on its back edge , then cutting slightly with a hot set which is twisted be-Figure fore withdrawing , creating small , sharply pointed projections on either side of the scarf . The steel is allowed to cool , and the split end of the tomahawk body is brought up to a cherry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed over the end of the anvil horn so that the split section is upright . The scarfed steel is placed in the split and hammered in with a couple of good , firm blows , then the iron is removed from the  | horn and the red iron hammered down so that the steel points penetrate the iron , holding it in place . Brush both pieces with a stiff steel brush before the two are hammered together to remove any excess oxide scale which may be present . Welding the steel and iron together is the next step . It must be remembered that the two metals reach welding heat at different temperatures , the iron requiring a higher temperature than the steel , and that steel burns and is ruined if heated beyond welding heat . When placed in the fire for welding , then the smith must place the iron portion nearer the hot center of the fire than the steel . Flux is liberally sprinkled along the edges of the joint when the metal reaches a cherry red . The two pieces must be brought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye must be kept on the two pieces so that they can be moved if the steel seems to be heating too quickly . When both pieces become white hot the smith sprinkles more flux on the joint , using his spoon so that the flux can be applied without removing the pieces from the fire . When welding heat is reached the two pieces are removed and placed resting on the edge of the anvil face at a slight angle that prevents the hot iron from touching the cold anvil . Then it is hammered with quick , sure blows , starting at the end of the split in the iron and working toward the edge with glancing blows that mold the iron and steel together , making , generally , an invisible joint . The piece should he turned over quickly as soon as one side is hammered and quickly molded on the opposite side . At this point , while the joined metal is still hot , the roughly shaped blade may be forged into nearly finished form by hammering edgewise over the horn and flat on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notch is put on the bottom of the blade using a small fuller or the wedgeshaped pein of a hammer . After that the eye is dressed or  | drifted to a round or oval or a diamond shape , and the top and bottom of the blade is dressed by forging or by trimming with a hot set . The flatter is used to smooth up the cheeks of the blade . If no flatter is available , the cheeks can be slightly bulged in the center section to make final filing easier . After ternperirrg to a pigeon blue , the tomahawk can be ground or filed to remove all oxide scale and to finish shaping . Some smiths in the Indian era made a number of different forms of tomahawks ; some , called pipe tomahawks , had a pipe bowl forged or brazed to the back of the eye . Techniques for these more elaborate tomahawks are described in an excellent book , American Indian Tomahawks , by Peterson , published by the Museum of the American Indian , New York . There is virtually no difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ax is just made of heavier stock . In the American colonies , however , where cutting trees was a necessity , the felling ax was refined and given a short blade and a poll behind the eye to provide balance . Sometimes the poll was preformed as a boss on a strip of iron which was then bent around a drift . Often , though , the polled ax was made of three pieces , two pieces of iron to make the sides and , of course , a steel blade . For making axes most smiths kept wooden patterns for the heads of felling axes , broadaxes , hatchets , half-hatchets , and for any special design or weight his trade might want . To make an ax the smith must use a hot set roughly to trim two flat bars of iron to fit the pattern . These are welded together at the poll , with care taken not to carry the weld into the part that is intended for the eye . Now an elliptical drift is inserted between the two wings of welded iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the drift . After removing the drift the blade is welded , except for the front 1A inch , which must receive the steel . As with  | Figure tomahawks the steel is roughed on its back side and driven into the split left from welding and welded in . Finishing is accomplished by drifting the eye , shaping and straightening the blade , and tempering and grinding to its final shape . Some old-time smiths preferred to punch the eye to avoid too much welding , with its danger of burning the iron . This is often satisfactory with a ' long , narrow ax-eye if the finest ( itiality Swedish iron is used . Poorer iron , however , may split along its fibers . With punched-eye axes the slit into which the steel edge is welded must be cut with a hot set . " Adz " is a word hardly heard of , even in isolated rural areas , after World War II except in a game of Scrabble . To eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century carpenters , and to certain specialized workmen in the timber industries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a form of ax or hatchet , differing from these fundamental tools in that the plane of its blade is perpendicular to its handle . Hand adzes were used to shape boards , to hollow out wooden troughs , and to smooth barrel staves . Foot adzes , which were used with both hands , were used to smooth squared logs in cabins , to shave down boards from half-logs , and , most recently , to  | shape railroad ties . They were widely used to carve ribs and smooth strakes in the shipbuilding industry . Of course , in the days before the mass production of all tools , adzes were made of iron with a steel blade welded in place . The manufacture , though , is quite different in that the square eye was always punched and drifted , rather than welded around a bar , as with axes . Adzes are generally made from quite heavy iron bars , 1 inch by 11/2 inches , or perhaps 1% - inches square . For ease in handling , the smith should try to start an adz on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the work can be done by holding the iron barehanded instead of with tongs , which become more awkward the heavier the work being done . While an adz blade is quite thin , the eye of the tool is a rectangular extended sleeve , designed to hold the handle without any play whatsoever , in order to insure accurate strokes while adzing . Despite the difficulties this creates in forming the tool , it is easier in the long-run to follow the general rule of thumb and punch the eye first through the wider dimension of the bar . A rectangular punch 1 inch by 1% inches is used , the long axis of the punch running lengthwise along the tool . While the iron is white hot the hole , previously worked with a center punch , is punched three quarters through from the bottom , 21,4 inches from its end . The iron is then turned and punched from the top and the plug driven out over the edge of the anvil . A slightly tapering rectangular drift is now used to stretch and dress the hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If a long bar is available the blade is formed at the end . This is done by fullering the bar on one side , starting within 3 inch of the eye . After fullering , the blade is smoothed and further drawn out with a hammer until it is about 1/2 - inch thick at the eye , 3% - inches long , and it is spread 3-inches wide at the end . It should not be drawn to less than 1A - inch  | Figure thickness on the end , which is then scarfed for welding to the steel edge . The blade is beveled along its edges to 1/8 inch , leaving a 1/z-inch ridge in the center section next to the eye to provide strength and to insure that the blade will not bend in use . Unlike axes , the steel bit of adzes is lap-welded to the top of the blade . The steel , slightly narrower than the iron and ' ! E-inch thick , must be scarfed on one edge . After welding to the top of the iron blade , the bar is trimmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since an adz is tempered rather hard and relatively brittle , the edge can not be forged to as thin an edge as an ax . Forming the poll is also done with the fuller , starting close to the eye . The poll should be further drawn out with a hammer until it is about 1-inch thick , its width being that of the original bar . If the adz is being forged on the end of a  | Figure long bar , it can now he cut off 1 inch from the eye , and the face of the poll can he dressed flat . The corners formed by the eye and both blade and poll should be dressed with the set hammer , or with a small fuller for a rounded corner . To draw out the eye , this part is heated to a white heat and the drift is inserted . The sides of the eye are then drawn out with glancing blows of the hammer , molding each of the four sides into a flat surface , which is beveled from the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of the eye . Curving the blade roughly to fit the arc formed when an adz is in use is done with a soft hammer over the big end of the horn . After curving , the bottom side of the blade may require some smoothing and chamfering with a light hammer . Tempering is the last step before grinding and finishing with a file . Adz edges are tempered to a purple , almost as hard as a razor .  | There is some variation in the manner of making an adz . One example of an old handmade adz demonstrates that its maker merely welded the eye punched in a 1-inch-thick bar of iron some 3-inches long ? to a long piece of steel that formed blade and poll . Undoubtedly he drifted the eye out after welding . In using mild steel after 1870 , some smiths formed the poll by using a chisel to cut the heavy metal behind the eye to about 3/4 inch from the top . This portion was then bent back and forged into shape . Such a method , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would cut through the fibers and weaken the poll . Making hand adzes required the same techniques on a smaller scale . Also hand adzes were curved to fit the needs of the customer . A carpenter with short arms might have required slightly more curve than one with long arms . Gouge blades , as in a small cooper 's adz or a large gutter adz , were hollowed over the horn or in a bottom swage . Augers , drill bits , and reamers , for wood and metal , were a product of local smithies until the 1860s and 1870s in Europe and America . Neither are particularly difficult to make . All were generally made of steel rather than a combination of steel and iron . Drill bits and reamers ' for metal are no more than flattened rods with the end , of the shank upset for about 3/4 inch down , to form a tapered square portion that fits into the chuck of a brace or beam drill . Usually this is done by heating the end to a white heat , then cooling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before upsetting . By the time the upsetting has been accomplished , enough heat has run into the cooled portion so that it is again red and can be dressed in the same heat . Drill points are formed by flattening the end of a steel rod after upsetting the shank and filing it to a point which measures 30 degrees between the long axis and the perpendicular . Reamers , made of a rod flattened for from 1 to 6 inches , are filed to a 30-degree angle along the edges . Both  | Figure reamers and drills are packed , as in making cold chisels , and both are tempered to a straw yellow . The old-fashioned drill bit was replaced generally in the 1870s by factory-made twist drills which are made on special milling machines . Auger bits present more of a problem to manufacture to the smith than metal drills . Essentially a drill is a scraping instrument , while the auger bit cuts and must therefore have a cutting edge . A simple bit is formed from a steel rod , upset and square-tapered on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of steel is welded on to the opposite end to give it width , but if the rod is big enough the bit end can be drawn out flat , or a flat bar of steel can be drawn down into a shank that is then upset on the end . Forming the cutting blade is done with either chisel or file . The flat end is shaped to provide a pivot in the center , a scriber on one side that cuts a circle into the wood as the bit is rotated , and a triangular cutting blade perpendicular to the flat of the bit , slightly slanted across its width , that cuts out the wood outlined by the scriber.  | Between the pivot point and the scriber the metal is cut or filed out with the top edge perpendicular to the axis of the bit . The cutting blade is formed by a diagonal edge from a spot at the base of the pivot point to the outside corner of the cutting side . This triangular section is then heated and bent to its perpendicular plane , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scriber . A long , twisted auger bit can be formed from a long rod upset at one end , which is drawn out thin and to the width of the hole desired . If for cutting a large hole , it can be made from a flat bar of steel to which an iron or steel rod is welded at one end . Its cutting end is formed as with a simple auger bit . The twist is formed by heating the flat section evenly along its width to a cherry-red , holding one end in the vise and twisting the other end . The smith must be careful to twist in a clockwise direction so that the wings of the bit will extract chips of wood while the brace is being turned . Twisting is even as long as the heat is even , otherwise the hotter sections of the bit will twist more tightly than the cooler sections . The twist must be done in one heat . After twisting , the bit can be straightened with a wooden mallet or a lead hammer , then tempered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn to a pigeon blue . While a straight , well-tempered twist bit was important to an old-time carpenter who fed his brood by boring holes , making such a bit can be an artistic experience for the smith . I f his eye is good enough to insure an even tone of cherryred along the part to be twisted , the twisting itself demonstrates the satisfying qualities of hot iron as a working material . The smith must be somewhat careful in twisting , but so long as he turns evenly and does not drop his tongs accidentally in the debris of his shop floor , the iron twists quite naturally into a graceful , perfect spiral . What smith , on seeing it turn out right , can help having the slight feeling of  | being a demigod , a touch of the mythical magic of Hephaestus , a sense of well-being in his choice of a trade and pride in the craftsmanship resulting from his cumulative experience ? Such control over a reluctant element brings a certain headiness which can not be bought by all the wealth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used during the days of handcrafts . It was called a spoon bit , and it was used more to enlarge holes than to bore them . Its shape resembled an elongated spoon bowl with the regular shank found on one end . To make it the smith starts as though with a twist bit , but forming a round end . Instead of twisting , however , he  | hollows , using the fuller in the correctly-sized cavity of a bottom swage or a swage block . He takes care to hollow the two ends of the bit evenly and to see that the center axis of the shank and the long edges of the bit lie on the same plane . After tempering to a pigeon blue he sharpens the end and the left-hand side to a razor edge . Shovels are such pedestrian , commonplace ditchdigger 's tools , so taken for granted by gardeners and workmen alike , that few speculate how they were made by hand before the days of factories . Well , they were made by the local blacksmith , and it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that a large surface must he heated and thin sheet iron must be welded . Shovels recovered from a ship sunk at the Battle of Yorktown and those dug up from Civil War battlefields are made in the same manner , indicating that the mode of manufacture was well established in the eighteenth century and was not improved in the next one hundred years . Sheet iron ' /s - inch thick and as wide as necessary is the Figure  | basic material used . Two sheets are required for a shovel , one shorter than the other by about 6 inches . These are cut with bench shears to fit a wooden pattern roughly resembling a shovel , with a 10-inch-square blade and a tang some 21/2 - inches wide and 10- to 12-inches long . After cutting to fit the pattern the tangs are heated to orange-red and three or four rivet holes are punched down the center axis of each . While still hot the tangs are roughly hollowed over the horn . A special mandrel is needed to finish shaping the tangs and the hollow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more than a sharpened rod of the same diameter as the intended handle . Some mandrels are straight , but same are curved gracefully to shape the shovel for a curved handle . The mandrel is placed on the anvil face , and the sheets of iron heated to orange-red are hammered to fit it , top and bottom . Once shaped , the two pieces are welded together . It is extremely difficult to fit two thin pieces of sheet iron precisely together and weld them before they lose welding heat . The solution is to fasten the two together with a couple of light rivets or by doubling the back edge of one over the other or by clamping with heavy tongs secured with a tong ring . This avoids the problem of precisely fitting the two Figure  | pieces very quickly . Also , the double thickness of iron holds the heat longer than a single thickness , giving more time for welding . Before fastening , though , both plates should be heated and sprinkled liberally with flux on the surfaces to be welded . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half at a time . To avoid burning or excess oxidation of the thin sheet iron , the fire must be deep and the bellows must be pumped gently , to slowly bring the pieces to a semimolten state on one half . Once that state is reached the shovel is brought from the fire and hammered , starting at the back , following the edges , and then across the bottom of the shorter sheet . Hammering must be done quickly before the iron cools too much to join . The process is repeated on the other half . Final finishing consists of reinserting the mandrel to dress the tangs and the handle cavity in the blade , and to shape the blade to a curve or hollow if desired . Handles are riveted on . Some old handmade shovels were riveted together instead of being welded . This method , however , must be considered an expedient , for a riveted shovel can not be so durable as one that is welded . On occasion a meticulous smith might have welded a thin strip of steel to the digging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and durable tool . Most would have renovated an iron blade by welding on a new strip of iron when the original had worn down . Some riveted shovels were fitted over a wedge-shaped wooden core which gave them additional strength . Any smith skillful enough to make a hammer , an ax , or an adz can make digging tools such as pickaxes and mattocks and hoes . Mattocks and pickaxes generally had steel points and edges , with more steel than an ax ; they had to be redressed frequently and drawn out to a new point . Since pickaxes and mattocks are still part of the equip-  | ment of building and utility companies , the shops of these businesses are about the last refuges in industry for forges . Some still maintain a small forge for redressing picks and mattocks and air drill bits , now that the general blacksmith and the specialist tool dresser are so diminished in number as to be almost nonexistent . There is a master tool dresser , however , still active in Atlanta . Mr. E. W. Horne , son and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tempering all manner of tools for a very large clientele . A sometime product of the old local smith was the saw . Most saws , though , were made by specialists in a few centers of Europe until first made in America by Lindley , Johnson and Whitcroft , about 1840 . A saw , in principle , is not difficult to make . It is nothing more than a thin sheet of steel with teeth filed into it , the teeth then being set at a slight angle , to widen the cut and avoid binding . Before rolling mills were developed , however , it must have taken a very careful worker to draw out steel to the evenness required by a saw blade , but it was done , for the saw is an ancient instrument . Thinning evenly was probably done with a flatter . The main difficulty in making a saw by hand from scratch would be tempering such thin stock without warping or breaking it . A special elongated fire and a special quenching tub are surely needed . Even with such special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a uniform cherry red , and later a pigeon blue , is immense . In America , and probably in Europe , the local smith was sometimes called upon to repair a broken saw . Old John Whitley , a bearded smith of great reputation who lived in the upper settlement of Vinings , Cobb County , Georgia , between 1842 and his death in 1910 , was said to have been able to weld a broken crosscut saw so skillfully that one could not tell it from a new one . His skill , however , has so overshadowed his methods that no record of how he tempered the  | repaired blade has been kept . Usually a saw that developed a split was repaired by brazing . One of the more ingenious tools which has been discarded by modern craftsmen , for reasons unknown , is the holdfast . This simple device was merely a crooked rod jambed into a hole in the work bench or anvil to grip a piece of wood or metal being worked . In essence it serves as the upper jaw of a vertical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaw . Although the function of a holdfast was stable , its form varied according to the taste and skill of the smith who made it . Some were made of round rod , and some of square . The square jambed better than the round , but it also disfigured the hole in the benchtop more quickly . In general form they resembled a misshapen " L , " the long leg being the shank , which was jambedinto the bench . The other leg was short and had a button upset on its end or on the flattened end . The bridge between was sometimes flattened vertically to provide strength . Holdfasts can be made from % - inch rods or bars cut to Figure  | 12-inch length . As usual , if long stock is available it is much easier to forge and shape one end before cutting , to avoid the need for tongs . First of all , the end is upset into a button 1-inch or 11-inches wide , or merely flattened to a surface 1-inch square . The bridge portion , about 3-inches long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1-inch wide by Y2-inch thick , tapering to the buttoned end . This bridge portion is first shouldered where the flattening begins . After drawing out it is bent over the round corner of the anvil , on the side opposite the shoulder , to a 90-degree angle , and is then curved downward to the button . The end is curved back to make the bottom surface of the button , perpendicular to the shank . Holdfasts with round shanks are made the same way , or they can be made of two pieces of iron . The shank , % inch to % inch in diameter and 4-inches long , may have a tenon 1/4 inch in diameter and % - inch long formed on one end . A piece of flat iron %-inch wide , 1/s-inch thick , and 5-inches long is wrapped around this tenon and welded to the shank , the extensions being welded together as with a tomahawk blade . After welding , this flat piece is tapered and a button Figure  | Figure is upset and flattened on its end . The arm thus joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a 70-degree angle so that the flat bottom of the button is perpendicular to the shank . Before 1790 nails were an important product of any smithy . Most smiths , as a consequence , had a variety of nailheaders , made in the smithy , to produce all of the dozen or more types of nails needed by craftsmen , from the millwright to the upholsterer . Nailheaders are easy to make from a bar of steel %-inch thick and from +-inch to 1-inch wide . First they are pierced / inch from the end with an acutely pointed four-sided punch . The size of the nail desired determines the depth to which the punch is driven . The hole where the punch protrudes should fit the base of the intended nail . Headers should be tempered to a straw color . Next the bar is drawn down to a %-inch thickness to form a boss surrounding the small end of the hole . For horseshoe nails , a depression the shape of the nailhead is swaged in the  | Figure small end of the hole . Many smiths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of nails . When machinery repair became an important part of the smith 's trade , he developed some ingenious methods of forging these parts , methods requiring much visualization . For instance , the making of a valve handle demonstrated how a little thought can make a seemingly difficult job a simple task . A valve handle usually is square , about 1 inch thick , with four cylindrical projections emanating from its corners . Welding seems in order , but there is a much easier way to make it . In the center of a 1-inch-square bar 3-inches long , a square hole is punched to fit the valve stem . Both ends are drawn out to shoulders about % - inch thick and 1 %-inches  | Figure long , leaving a 1-inch-square. boss surrounding the hole . The shoulders should be slightly thicker on the ends than next to the boss . Next each shoulder is split from the boss to the end . These splits are widened until the two legs of each shoulder are spread into a 90-degree angle . Each leg is then forged smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the angle between the legs is finished with a large fuller . Spanner wrenches are made generally of flat steel bars . The bars are drawn down in the center portion , reducing the width and leaving a boss at each end . Each boss is punched to create holes of the proper size . The smith should punch these holes slightly off-center to leave the metal thicker and stronger in that part directly opposite the opening of the jaw . Jaws are formed by using a chisel to cut out a section of the hole 's circumference equal in width to the diameter of the hole . After filing smooth , the wrench is tempered to a brown color . The tools used by mankind throughout history are legion . The blacksmith played a major part in making most of them .  | Figure To describe his technique in making every tool needed by burgeoning progress requires an encyclopedia , and even an encyclopedia could not possibly be complete , for each smith had his own problems and ideas , much as individual painters and musicians develop one of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Aside from the basic tools of forging ? hammer , anvil , bellows the smith usually had the creative ability to design his own special tools needed for making the tools of his customers . Therein lies his strength ; and therein lies the problem of describing all the techniques  | of tool making of all the thousands of smiths for all the thousands of years the individual blacksmith has served mankind . If ever a modern man must make some special tool of iron or steel , let him consider the basic qualities of the material ; let him use fire and air and weight to shape the metal . He will find that a little imagination applied to his problem will provide him with a strange and exciting alchemy . Through his science , combined with his art , he will find that he can transform the most reluctant metal into the most tractable , and literally shape it to his will . Interestingly , the blacksmith is serving one of our most modern industries , jet aircraft maintenance , in at least one instance . The U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a smith at the base who is frequently called on by mechanics to make special tools needed for maintenance , and unavailable from normal sources of tool supply . In effect old I lephaestus still lives to help furnish thunderbolts which are hurled through our contemporary skies .  | THE TECHNIQUES OF Making HARDWARE Modern mass-production methods of stamping out the hardware of houses and buildings is so taken for granted that one hardly gives a thought to it . Who notices the simple ingenuity of a hinge or a window latch ? Who pauses to give thought to the thousands of nails used in even the simplest building ? Who takes the time to count the myriad metal parts and separate screws of all the locks and latches that insure privacy and security to home and office ? Indeed , who cares ! All the separate items of hardware we see or use every day are as much a part of life as our clothes and transportation . These items came from the building supplier or the hardware store , and these establishments order them from the factories , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of this material came from the blacksmith , perhaps the village smith who made it all on order or , in larger areas , from a specialized forge that manufactured only one item , such as Thomas Jefferson 's nail factory . This was hardly great industrial organization , for the personnel consisted of two young colored boys , each equipped with forge and anvil , hammer and hardie , and a supply of nail rods . Even the great demand for hinges for wagons , house doors , barns , and finely made cabinets was satisfied with handmade hinges until the 1870s . In St. Louis , the Hager Hinge Company , which started as a blacksmith and wheel-  | wright 's shop in 1849 and is now one of the three largest hinge manufacturers in the world , did not acquire its first hinge-making machine until 1873 . Nail-making machines were perfected just before the end of the eighteenth century , but because they made a limited variety of cut nails they did not entirely replace the smith as a nail maker until almost a hundred years after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has its molding fastened with small handmade nails . Until modern times in some backwoods areas in America and Europe , and perhaps still in the backward regions of the world , nails were a product of the blacksmith . Nails are ancient devices , and over the centuries were developed in many forms for many special uses . All , however , are made according to the same basic technique . There were roseheaded nails , some with flat points , clasp nails for soft wood , and finishing nails with a T- or L-shaped head , as can be seen in the fine carpentry of the Governor 's Palace in Williamsburg . There were Flemish tacks , widebeaded brads , cabinet brads , flooring brads , and tenterhooks , as well as clouts and clogs and scuppers . Then there were horseshoe nails . Nails are made from nail rods , long slim rods usually about a 1/4 - inch square , which , from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries , were supplied by rolling mills and slitting mills and were delivered in bundles tied together with wire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the site of Jefferson 's nail factory . Before the time of slitting mills , nail rods were forged by hand , usually by an apprentice , who was given a pile of old horseshoes and other scrap from which he would draw out the rods . Indeed the transformation of scrap into nail rods was practiced in isolated smithies well into the nineteenth century , until cut nails were manufactured cheaply in volume beginning about 1830.  | Figure Henry Ison , a Negro smith of Spalding County , Georgia , made his own fence staples out of heavy wire well into the twentieth century , as his apprentice-grandson Otis Hall remembers . Nails , once one gets the hang of it , are not difficult to make in volume . Several rods are kept in the fire , heated to an orange-red , taken out one at a time , and forged to a long square taper on the end . While still red , the rod is cut nearly through , about 1/s inch beyond where the taper starts , usually  | a couple of inches from the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a straight-pein hammer . The rod is inserted point-first in the nailheader placed above the hardie or pritchel hole . The rod is then twisted in two at the cut , and the head is formed with a good blow or two of the hammer . In the case of roseheaded nails , four hammerblows Figure  | Figure are given at a slight angle . Of course , nails with special heads have the heads swaged to shape in a depression in the header . After heading , the nail and header are quenched . The point of the nail , protruding through the bottom of the header , is then tapped on the anvil and driven out onto the floor to be collected later , or into a bucket set next to the anvil . Staples are made in a similar manner , though no header is used . The wire is heated and cut off with the hardie at about a 10-degree angle . It is then bent double over the small end of the horn and cut off again on the hardie . Staples can be bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of a fork requires a sharp-peined hammer for cutting . Small tacks and nails are more difficult to make than large spikes , simply because the small rods used will not hold heat for a very long time . Despite this , however , an accomplished nail maker can manufacture a couple of thousand tacks a day . In shops where nails were a big item of trade , or in the  | rare specialized operations such as the factory at Monticello , special stake anvils were used instead of nailheaders . Some were even equipped with treadle-operated hammers , though the advantage of this device over hand hammers is hard to see . Bolts were frequent products of the old-time general smithy , and the technique of welding the heads on to large bolts is useful to know , for it may be applied to many other items . To make a bolt head , the smith wraps a piece of care fully measured bar around a rod . The ends of the bar should not meet , but should have a space between equal to its thickness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the hammer and butt welded . The stretching assures that bar and rod are also tightly welded . Hinges are an essential part of any established society , and in the old days they were handmade in a number of forms , each with many variations . Doors in houses needed " L " - or " H-hinges " ; small cabinets were fitted with finely forged " tulip " or " butterfly hinges , " chests and boxes had hidden " butt hinges . " Great churchdoors were often hung by huge decorative strap hinges , marvels of craftsmanship and design . Butt hinges are the simplest to make . The smaller ones are no more than flat , thin sheets of iron , the middle of which is folded tightly around a rod to form the channel for the hinge pin . Two or three holes for screws are punched in the double thicknesses of the leaves , later to be countersunk with the brace and a countersink , or the point of a larger drill . With the rod still enclosed , the openings are cut so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hinge pin . This is done I ) y cutting the double leaf with a fine chisel , the cut being parallel to the rod and along the interior one third of the hinge on one and the outer two thirds on the other . The rod is then removed and the openings cut through with a hacksaw and filed smooth .  | Figure After necessary filing the two leaves are then fitted together , pins are inserted , and the hinge is completed . Butterfly and gunstock hinges are made similarly , but usually they are of single thickness . Only the edge of the sheet is folded around the rod for each leaf . Finishing follows the same procedure as with flat hinges . Shapes are cut with a cold chisel or with large shears after the pin channels are formed and fitted . Lettered hinges , T- , L- , and H-hinges , require welding . A T-hinge , for instance , consists of two straps , perpendicular to each other . The horizontal strap is easy to make . It is bent round a rod at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Usually it is gracefully tapered with an acorn , a fleurde-lis , or a ram 's horn formed on the open end . Holes for nails or screws are punched and later countersunk if desired . The vertical jamb strap may be a straight bar or it may have deco-  | Figure rative ends to match the door strap . Some , indeed , are bent into a semicircle to provide strength and decoration . To the basic strap , two smaller straps are welded on at right angles , far enough apart to receive the horizontal door strap . These are then bent around a rod and the ends welded . A pin , sometimes with an upset and decorative head , holds the two leaves together . Both leaves of an H-hinge are made like the jamb strap of the T-hinge . L-hinges are no more than H-hinges with an additional strap welded at a right angle to the leg of the " I I. " Or the " L " can be cut from plate with a chisel . Tulip hinges , which grace so many Colonial cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On them ,  | only the leaf on the jamb has a channel , usually no more than 3i6 inch in diameter . This is formed , as with strap hinges , by wrapping around a rod and welding . The pin is a tenon at the butt of the stem of the other leaf , which at its other end is forged into a graceful tulip-shape , to give the hinge its name . Starting with a small bar , the smith flattens one end for the tulip bud . If he wishes to get quite fancy and provide tulip leaves also , he thins the iron below the tulip bud into a lozenge shape , then with a chisel makes two cuts that form the stem and at the same time divide the leaves from the stem . Below the leaves he draws down the base of the stem , rounding it to a 1/4 - inch diameter . This then has a 3is-inch tenon formed in the end with a small set hammer , or the flat end of a bar substituted for the set hammer . Tenon shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stem is held in the vise , bud down . In the absence of a monkey tool , a fairly thick bar through which a 3ii6-inch hole Figure  | has been drilled can be used to dress the tenon shoulders . Final shaping of the stem , a rather delicate job , is done while the iron is orange-red , either with a light hammer or a pair of pliers . Smoothing is done with a fine file , and sufficient holes are drilled in bud , leaves , and stem for small screws or nails . Making large strap hinges , which were used for barndoors and , in a decorative form , for church and castle doors , followed inversely the technique used for tiny tulip hinges . The strap is formed as with a T-hinge by bending the end of the strap around a rod and welding it . There is no leaf on the jamb , only an upright pin with a sharp shank at right angles to the pin for driving into the jamb . This is made by doubling a narrow bar 1/2 - inch wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bar is welded to the rod and welded together where it extends . The extension is then drawn out to a sharp point which can be driven into the jamb . This is called a " pinIle . " The strap is fastened to the door with spikes long enough to penetrate the door and clinch on the other side . Figure  | Figure Decorative strap hinges require good power of visualization and considerable ingenuity to make . Suppose , for instance , one wishes to make a hinge with a fleur-de-lis terminal and two or three scrolls extending from the strap . First a bar 2-inches wide , 1/4 - inch thick , and 2-feet long is roughly shaped into a stepped-down taper with a spade end . The fleur-de-lis is formed by making two slanted cuts on the spade-shaped end . These are then bent into semicircles . Scrolls are formed in the same manner . The steps are split off with a chisel for 2 inches parallel to the axis of the strap . Each is then curved away from the strap . Holes are punched for spikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is hardly a limit to the elaboration that can be applied to a decorative hinge . Some may be punched in suitable places with holes of different shapes . Some may be split at certain points and the splits widened to any desired design . On occasion , some have extra extensions welded on , but those made from one piece seem to have more grace and strength to their curves . Before the 1860s almost every house in any civilized land had shutters for each of its windows . Each shutter required a fastener to hold it open during daylight hours . Before 1790 shutter fasteners were hand-forged , a simple job for an experienced smith , and far more graceful in finished form than the patent fasteners made partially of cast iron after 1790 . Shutter fasteners consisted of two pieces , a tenoned spike  | driven into the side of a house and a rotating fastener , traditionally S-shaped , through which the tenon was bradded . The spikes are made just as nails are made before heading . Instead of a head they have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set hammer or a bar with a flat end , with shoulders formed by the monkey tool or a drilled bar . To make a fastener the smith takes a small , narrow bar 3-inches long by Y2-inch wide and punches a hole to fit the tenon in its center . He then forms a boss on each end , but on opposite sides , the bar being drawn down to a taper from the hole to the base of the boss . The boss itself can be formed on the edge of the anvil or with a bottom fuller . The tapers can Figure  | be formed into a gentle curve over the horn , each end curving in a different direction toward its boss , to form an elongated " S. " The fastener is then placed over the tenon , and the end of the tenon is upset to form a brad . ( Incidentally , " bradding " means " broadening . " ) When the shutters are put in place , the fastener is driven into the clapboards or mortar of the house . Many old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curled into scrolls . Some forms of door latches are now mass produced in the forms developed by olden smiths in the days of handmade hardware . There were beautiful latches , in the days of the smith , some simple and some ingenious in design , each a little different from others of the same type . They are worthy of copying , and a few manufacturers have become capable of imitating them . Perhaps the simplest and easiest to make of all the door fasteners is a hook . One starts with a slender square bar , resembling the nail rods that might have been used in the old days . If no bar of proper dimension is available , the smith must resort to drawing down his own from an old horseshoe or whatever else can be adapted from the scrap pile . The eye is formed by heating the end and bending it Figure  | Figure around a rod stuck upright in the pritchel hole of the anvil . It is easier to form the eye so that its center is through the center axis of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the anvil before forming the circle . Most hooks had unwelded eyes , but a few were buttwelded or lap-welded where the circles end . Welding , however , is a delicate operation in this case . As always with small stock , the iron must be brought to welding heat slowly , to prevent burning the iron . When brought to welding heat for . t butt weld , the joint is made by gentle tapping with a light hammer of less than 1 pound in weight . Even with great care the smith may expect some distortion in the perfect circle of the eye . This can be corrected by drifting , using the rod the eye was originally formed around , and driving it through over the pritchel hole .  | Lap welding is easier , though perhaps not quite so neat as butt welding . For this , the end of the rod must be drawn down into a long taper before the eye is formed . This is lapped over the stem of the hook and welded on the edge of the anvil with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed by first tapering or pointing the hook end and bending it to a right angle about 1 inch from the point . The hook is shaped around a rod in the pritchel hole . Instead of closing the circle , however , the end of the hook is left perpendicular to the stem . The end is gently curved outwardly over the horn . Many hooks can then be finished by providing a full twist in the middle of the stem . Eyes that screwed into the door and jamb were seldom used in the old days . With each hook the smith provided two long staples , one to be nailed through the eye into the door and the other nailed in proper position on the jamb to receive the hook . Hasps were quite plain and strictly utilitarian in the old days . They were found mostly on barn doors and the doors of other outbuildings , such as corn cribs , chickenhouses , smokehouses , and the like . They could be secured with a hook bradded to the hasp , with an iron pin attached to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a string or thong , or with a heavy padlock ? all of which were inserted into a heavy staple . A hasp is easily made from a small bar of iron , 1/4-inch thick , 6-inches long , and 1-inch wide . While most are quite unrefined in appearance , an artistic smith forges a long taper on each end and rounds all corners . Then a 1/4 - inch hole is punched in one end and the other is split with a chisel , the split starting 1/2 inch from the end and continuing toward the center for 2 inches . Unless the highest-quality wrought iron or mild steel is used , the smith would be wise , however , to punch two holes marking the ends of the split and to cut  | Figure between them with the chisel . This prevents the iron from splitting out the end when it is spread . This split is then widened , after heating to a white heat , and a lozenge-shaped aperture is formed over the end of the horn . Hasps are attached to the door with a staple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jamb to fit into the aperture . Sliding bolts are found on many interior and exterior doors in homes all over the world . Most are quite simple to rnake , though many have small decorative details that require time and artistry . For instance , most acceptable sliding bolts are made with a ball end . They are shaped by drawing down a flat or square bar of the proper length to a long taper with the end left slightly larger . This end is then upset to broaden it , and it is hammered spherical with a light hammer . A small hole is punched at about the center of the porlion not drawn down . The end with the ball can be curved over the horn in any shape to fit the taste of the smith or his customer . To complete , the bolt is heated a dark , barely per-  | ceptible red around the punched hole , and a cold rod of the proper size is driven into the hole . Quenching shrinks the bolt tightly around the pin , which , when trimmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ' A inch on the outside , acts as a stop , to prevent the bolt from sliding out of its keepers . Keepers are more difficult to make than one might imagine , because of the problems of four right-angle bends in each . They are made of strap iron 1/s - inch to 1/4 - inch thick and %-inch wide . To determine the length needed to make a keeper the smith may make his pattern of thin sheet iron or lead sheet , or even wire . This is bent over the bolt with %-inch tangs bent on both ends . Then the wire is straightened and used to measure the length of strap iron for the three keepers needed for a single bolt . Some English smiths use a set of swages which form perfect keepers with one or two blows , but such tools are difficult Figure  | Figure to find and time-consuming to make . There are two devices which are more easily made and fully as effective . One may be made by first fullering , then filing a notch in the end of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the intended bolt plus one thickness of the keeper and as wide as the bolt plus two thicknesses of the keeper . To use , one places a piece of bolt stock on the anvil , puts the cherry red keeper over the bolt and forces it into shape by hammering down the hot iron with the simple , homemade top swage . Another device is to make a deep " U " of bolt stock which has a tongue of the same stock drawn out to %-inch thickness on one end , where it is riveted to the base of the " U , " being somewhat springy where it is drawn out . Space between the sides of the tongue and the inside surfaces of the " U " should equal the thickness of the keeper iron when hot . When the keeper iron is heated to a cherry red , the hot part is inserted into the tool , tongue on one side of the iron , both legs of the " U " on the other side . Then tool and iron are put into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect keeper . A Norfolk latch is considerably more complicated to  | Figure make . It consists of five separate parts , each shaped differently , and assembled together to create a small door-opening machine using Archimedes ' principle of leverage . Actually , it consists of a swinging bar with keeper , a thumb lever to raise the bar , and a handle for pulling the door open once it is unlatched . The bar is nothing to make , even for an apprentice ; it consists of a flat bar of iron drawn down to form a boss on one end through which a hole is punched for the pivot . Its action is restrained by a single keeper made exactly as the keepers on a sliding bolt . It fastens into the notch of a thin bar fastened to the doorjamb so that its notch protrudes beyond the  | jamb opposite the doorstop . It is slanted beyond the notch so that the swinging bar is cammed upward to fall into the notch automatically when the door is closed , and has two nail holes punched into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punched with a rectangular punch or the end of a bar , using a swage block as a punching surface . Complications arise in making the handle-thumb lever assembly . There are two methods of shaping the handle . One form can be shaped from a 1/2-inch-square bar 4-inches long , drawn down on opposite sides of a rectangular boss into 1% - inch- thick tangs , one 4-inches long , the other 2 inches . A rectangular hole 1/4 inch by 1/2 inch is punched through the boss for the thumb lever , its direction being perpendicular to the plane of the tangs . The boss is then drilled through its sides for the pivot pin of the lever , the hole being 1/4 inch . After curving the long tang into a handle and bending a short tang at its bottom , both top and bottom tangs can be formed with round or acorn flat bosses , or into double curves , fleurs-de-lis , arrowheads , or any other device the smith wishes . This type of handle has no backstrap between Figure  | handle and door , but is quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backstrap . In making the more complicated handle , handle piece and backstrap are shaped separately , the box-shaped boss being part of the handle . The handle is then welded to the backstrap at boss and lower tang , after which the boss is punched and drilled for the pivot pin . Thumb levers are easily made from a flat bar long enough to protrude through the door after being drawn out to a long slim taper . The slightly curved , flat thumbing surface on one end is formed by heating the bar orange-red and battering it to a flat surface perpendicular to the width and about 1/4 - inch thick . The remainder of the bar is then drawn out to a long rod %-inch thick and %-inch wide , ending in a long taper . Next the set hammer is used to form a raised spine in the center of the bottom of the thumbing surface , forming an extension of the drawn-out rod . Then the thumbing sur-Figure  | face , now flattened to a 1/s - inch thickness , is slightly curved over the horn , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is curved away from the upper surface of the thumbpiece . A hole is drilled sideways through the rod a quarter inch behind the thumbpiece to receive the pivot pin . In fastening to the door , bolt and keeper are on one side of the door and the handle on the other . Pushing the thumbpiece down lifts the bolt on the other side of the door . Lifting the curved end of the rod performs the same action . Many blacksmiths , especially in smaller villages , became locksmiths of necessity . The heavy old locks which graced the doors of Colonial and federal houses and fastened stronghoxes and the gates of European castles required forging and tempering . If the blacksmith did not make locks , then the locksmith needs must have been an accomplished blacksmith , with his equipment , in the shop . So many books have been written on the subject of locks , and there are so many practicing locksmiths in today 's society , that this volume will not duplicate their knowledge . All the forgings in a lock reflect the general techniques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are tempered in the same manner as gun springs and the springs on pipe tongs . The locksmith undoubtedly used more files than the general smith , for his work required a much finer tolerance and a tighter fit of its parts than most articles- turned out by the general smith . Other items of door hardware , though , were part and parcel of the trade handled by the general smith in every country of the civilized world . Doorknobs and knockers are practical items which perform their functions in a variety of designs . Old doorknobs , for instance , were sometimes actual knobs , %onaetimes rings , and sometimes handles similar to umbrella handles . Most were used to operate some sort of mechanical latch as found on the doors of modern houses . Consequently  | the knobs were forged on the end of a square rod that fit a square hole in the tumbler of the latch , but often the knob on either side of the door was punched to fit the rod and fastened to it with a pin . Sometimes the rod was inserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As with all handmade articles , the many nuances of design and assembly found in old knobs was determined by the taste and circumstances of the smith . There never was any dogma on forging methodology . Wallace Nutting , in his Furniture Treasury , illustrates an unusual ring handle that served double duty as a knocker . It consists of the usual square bar , one end of which was bradded to the inside handle . The outside handle consists of a swinging , nicely-shaped ring that presumably was knocked against a bolthead secured in the door beneath the handle . To make such a device the smith starts with the 1/2 - inchsquare pivot rod . This is upset at one end to form a boss slightly larger than the rod and pierced through with a 1/4 - inch punch . The ring is made from a piece of 1/2-inch rod or square bar . First the fuller is used to form a boss in the center of the rod . From this point the rod is drawn out on both sides to a taper which is just less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be forged square or octagonal , or rounded by first forging to an octagonal shape , then hammering the corners round by turning the rod back and forth while battering with a light hammer . Working at an orange heat , each point is bent to a right angle 1/4 inch from the end ; the inside of the bend is formed square on the corner of the anvil . Next another right-angle bend in the opposite direction is made about 2 inches from the first bend on both sides of the boss . After this , the length between the bends is rounded on the horn of the anvil , care being taken to see that the boss is in the center of the curve . This knocker-handle is attached  | to the pivot rod by heating the curved section to a cherry red , spreading far enough so that the upset end of the pivot rod passes between the right angles at either end ; then , when ends and hole are in position , tapping the ends together with a light hammer so that they meet in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made from a 1/2 - inch- square bar , drawn down to % - inch thickness from a % - inch boss on one end . This boss may be hammered octagonal or rounded while at a cherry red . A square hole is punched into the boss , either all the way through over the hardie hole if the pivot rod is to be bradded on , or partially through if the handle is to be secured by a pin . After punching the hole , the remaining portion of the handle is drawn down to a flat taper and formed into a gentle S-curve over the horn of the anvil . Some designs call for leaving a flat boss on the end , like shutter fasteners ; others may have the pointed end scrolled , and still others may  | have the end curved toward the door . Incidentally , it might take half a day to make either a ring handle or an L-shaped handle , including careful finishing with a file . Wrought-iron knobs , very similar to modern knobs though somewhat smaller , can be made in several ways . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3/4 - inch- thick plate that has been roughly rounded before welding . Then the square hole for the pivot rod is punched and the knob is finished by forging and filing . If the knob is to be fastened to the rod with a pin , the pinhole is drilled rather than punched . A knob and boss can he forged from one piece of heavy bar or rod by drawing out the boss with a large fuller and shaping it with a set hammer or with the monkey tool , or by swaging it round or square on the side of the swage block . After shaping , the square hole is punched . The knob is forged smooth by heating to a white heat , reinserting the boss in the swage block , and upsetting the shape of the knob with a 4-pound hammer . Doorknockers can also be made in a variety of shapes and sizes . Many , particularly in medieval and Renaissance times , were no more than large rings secured to the door with an eyebolt . To make this simple knocker the smith bends a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye and welds the two ends together as with a hinge pin , but the pin is re-  | Figure moved . The shank is sharpened for driving through the door and clinching on the other side . A rod is then shaped into a ring of 3- or 4-inches diameter , with ends scarfed preparatory to welding , and this is inserted in the eye . After assembling the two pieces the ring is welded and smoothed on the horn of the anvil . The knocker set may be completed by furnishing a heavy brad or bolt to be driven through the door so that its head is battered when the ring is lifted and let fall . The artistic smith may wish to shape his ring other than round . For instance , it may be heart-shaped , oval , or quatrefoil . It may have a boss formed on the ring where it meets the bolthead driven in the door . Another type of knocker consists of ' A - inch- thick plate with two projections at its upper end between which an S-shaped bar is mounted with a stout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shears or chisel into some interesting shape such as a shield , a tulip , or an eagle . Holes are then punched in appropriate spots to nail it to the door . Generally it is easier to weld on the two projections that hold the knocker bar . First a bar 3/4 inch by 1/2 inch is shaped into a square " l J. " This and the plate are brought to welding heat , the projections are quickly placed in position , and the two are elded together by inserting a bar with a flat end between the  | legs of the " U " and quickly hammering it with a light hammer . Some smiths may wish to fasten the two pieces together with a light brad before welding , particularly if the plate is light and subject to losing its welding heat quickly when placed on the cold anvil . A hole is drilled for the pin after welding . Welding may be avoided by using a forked spike , made by splitting and spreading the end of a sharpened bar which is driven through a punched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inside . Bars for this type of doorknocker may be of simple or elaborate design . Some are no more than a modified " S , " with the lower end upset to provide a larger battering surface and the upper curve drilled to receive the pin that fastens it to the plate . Sometimes this bar may be twisted , or curved at its upper end , or forged into a rough horse's-head , and finished by filing ; the final design rests with the smith 's artistic temperament and skill and with the taste of his customer . Chain , that useful device which was developed far back in antiquity , was usually an important part of a blacksmith 's trade even until modern times . The Boy Scouts of America offered a merit badge in blacksmithing until after World War IT , and one of its requirements was making a chain of at least three links . Chains were used in a number of sizes for chandeliers , ships ' uses , gate-closers , trace chains , padlocks , and , on occasion , as giant cables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge chain that closed the harbor of ancient Rhodes , stretching between the legs of the Colossus , and the heavy chain that stopped Norse longships from penetrating into France along the River Seine . Chain making was a large industry in nineteenth-century England . The London chainsmiths of that age became rich by hiring penniless victims of the Industrial Revolution at only a few pennies a day to slave over the forges making chains for fourteen hours a day .  | Handmade chain differs somewhat from modern chain which is made wholly by machinery , the links being arcwelded together . Generally the modern links are more nearly circles than the links of old handmade chain which generally were long ovals in shape . It is easy to speculate that longer links meant less welding per foot of chain , thus effecting considerable labor-saving . Trace chains have been in use from the time man first harnessed horses until the internal-combustion engine both displaced horses and brought about the demise of the blacksmith . To make a trace chain the smith cuts off 8-inch sections of 14-inch rod . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends and further bent to form at ) oval about 3 inches long , with the scarfed ends overlapping no more than 1/4 inch . Usually the smith will find that a.rod stuck upright in the pritchel hole will provide a convenient mandrel for shaping the links . The horn may be used , but more uniform shaping can be done around an upright rod . It is important to have the right sort of fire for welding chain . It must be deep and narrow , constructed so that the Figure  | links being welded can he thrust into a jet of heated air from which the oxygen has been nearly consumed . For the first link the smith grasps the oval at its unscarfed end and fastens his tong handles with a ring , so he need not disengage the tongs while the iron is in the fire . Since trace-chain links are made of relatively light rods , the smith must be careful not to blow his fire with too much gusto . To do so will make the fire itself burn out quickly , requiring early rebuilding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow fire can consume , thereby converting a large proportion of the iron into oxide , with consequent weakening of the chain . Placing the ringed tongs , with link held tightly in the jaws , at the edge of the fire with the scarfed end of the link projecting into the jet of heat , the smith pumps the bellows slowly until the iron turns cherry red . The link is withdrawn and flux is sprinkled liberally on the scarfing , sand or salt for soft iron , borax or a patented compound for mild steel . It is then thrust back into the fire until the scarfing becomes white , and then an oily light yellow . Then it is taken from the fire and joined by quick blows from a light hammer . It is important first to join the side on which the thin end of the scarf is underneath , next to the cold anvil face , with the hammerblows progressing quickly to the other end of the scarf . Before the iron cools the smith may wish to dress the welded portion by rounding it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chainsmith will make his links up before welding so that as each link is welded he can insert a new link into the one last joined and speed up his work . If he has several pairs of lip tongs he may wish to keep several short lengths of chain in the fire at one time , joining them together as the terminal step in making whatever length of finished chain he desires . After welding the first link , succeeding links are held by  | Figure the tongs so that the adjacent finished oval is fixed tightly , immobile against the side of the new link . This prevents finished links from falling in the fire . A hook formed on the end of a tong handle will hold finished chain out of the way . A more easily made chain was made by the smith for hanging chandeliers , for connecting his bellows to the lever pole , and for decorative functions where strength was not too much of a factor . This type is made of rods from 1/8 inch to 1% inch in diameter , cut in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The links are fastened together by inserting one eye in another and tapping together without welding . The links are easily formed by curving the end of the rod , while at an orange heat , around the small end of the horn , having enough space at the end to insert the adjacent Iink . A right-angle bend should be made in the end before the circle is formed , to insure that the completed circle is centered on the shank of the link . In those rare shops equipped with a floor mandrel , chain I inks are formed around the mandrel . While the blacksmith is best remembered for his horseshoeing , many forget the part he played in furnishing wagons  | Figure and carts for horses to pull . The wheelwright was a separate occupation in England and Europe , requiring a blacksmith to furnish hardware for wagons and to weld the tires . In America the smith usually was the village wheelwright , also ; he hired woodworkers as needed to make and assemble the felloes and spokes , axles and body of wagons . Almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products , the difference being based on personality in America and on tradition , to some extent , in Europe and in England , where such traditional models as the graceful and sturdy Cotswold wagon were produced for a certain area generation after generation . Welded iron tires for the wheels , however , which were used from Roman times until Ford times , required the precise skill of a master blacksmith . Tires must be shrunk on a wheel , which means that a 5-foot wheel , for instance , must have a tire measured and welded with no more than ' A6-inch tolerance between the circumferences of tire and wheel . The smith , using tools and techniques developed over the ages , arose to the occasion . Measuring a wheel and cutting a strip of iron to an exact length before welding is fully as important in assuring a tight fit for a wagon tire as the bending and welding . Be-  | cause of this , and because wood reacts to humidity , a good smith would not guarantee tires put on in wet weather and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creek on the way to his shop . To measure a wheel accurately the smith employs his traveler , a metal , or sometimes wooden , measuring wheel mounted in a handle . In the twilight years of smithing , travelers of quite fancy design were sold by most hardware wholesalers . They consisted of a flat iron wheel , its circumference marked with a stamped line every lis inch , and with a pointer mounted on the axle of the wheel which could be set to mark any part of the circumference . Of course , this wheel and pointer pivoted between two legs of a handle , just as the front wheel of a bicycle is mounted on the front fork . To measure the wheel , the smith marks an arbitrary starting point with pencil or chisel . The zero point of the traveler is placed on this mark , and the traveler is run around the wheel , the smith noting the number of full turns it makes . When the traveler again reaches the starting mark on the rim , the smith marks the traveler rim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of chalk , or a soapstone pencil . The portion of the traveler thus marked plus the number of complete turns made is equal to the circumference of the wheel . Rather than ruin a piece of tire iron through overconfidence , the smith usually follows the ancient adage of all craftsmen : measure twice and cut once . When the wheel itself is measured , the smith selects a tire iron of proper size and , laying it out on his bench or floor , measures it with the traveler to match the circumference of the wheel and marks the iron with a piece of soapstone or chalk . Now comes the test of skill and experience . In tiring a new wheel the smith must take into consideration the spaces between the felloes ( usually not more than r/is inch between  | each of the seven felloes ) and subtract this aggregate measurement from the measured circumference of the tire iron . He must also decide how much " dish " the wheel must have , since dish , the drawing of the spokes outward at an angle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel . Normal dish usually subtracts another 1/2 inch from the circumference of a 4-foot tire , but for large wheels even more must be subtracted . Because wood contracts and tires must be shrunk on to fit tightly , an additional bit must be subtracted from the measured circumference of the wheel to provide a tight fit . This varies from 1/2 inch to % inch on tires 2-inches wide , to 5/16 inch to 3/s inch on a narrow buggy-wheel tire 1-inch wide . These estimates are those of Sump Brown , who proudly guaranteed every wheel he tired . The subtractions noted above apply to new wagon wheels in dry weather . In fitting together tolerant wood and intolerant metal the smith , if successful as a wheelwright , has to note , and to feel instinctively , the variables of weather and other conditions . Of course , in re-tiring old wheels , which have no space between the joints and already have a dish , all the subtractions noted above may be foregone and only the last applied , to shorten the iron after it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined and marked carefully with a soapstone pencil , the tire is cut off with a cold chisel . Some smiths scarf the ends before bending the tire round , but this method was generally followed before patent tire benders appeared around 1870 . Before then , tires were bent into a circle by one of several means . Some smiths bent a tire by hand by holding one end with the helper holding the other , and bending it around a post or a handy tree . Wrought iron , which was the only type available before the days of mild steel , bent easily in this manner . After bending into a rough circle , the tire was made into a nearly  | perfect circle by hammering over the horn or the end of a log mounted horizontally . Only a soft hammer was used for this to avoid battering the surface . There is some evidence to indicate that a few smiths might have had special anvils with the face concave on the long axis , to facilitate hammering the tire into a true circle . After about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market . These consisted of a cast-iron form containing three or four rollers that were turned simultaneously with a series of cogwheels actuated with a handcrank . The rollers were easily adjusted to bend a tire to any desired diameter after the end of the tire iron had been inserted between two rollers and the crank turned until the full length of the tire had passed through . So Figure versatile were these simple bending machines that they could be adjusted to bend the tire of a great 6-foot log-cart wheel , or a hub band of only 6-inch diameter . Tire benders were standard equipment for any shop in America and Europe which worked on wagons . When so equipped , the smith postponed scarfing the ends of a tire until after bending ; otherwise the ends would not pass between the rollers of the bender . Once bent , a tire was easily prepared for welding . In England , and perhaps in other old-world smithies , the scarfed ends were sometimes punched and bradded together with a  | small nail to hold the ends in correct juxtaposition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends in position without fastening , and most American smiths eliminated this step Instead they prepared about 1-inch overlap where the scarfs met , and before welding they reversed the positions of the ends so that the outside end rested on the inside surface . Thus the stiffness of the circled tire held the two ends tightly together without need of fastening . It is well also to chamfer the corners of the scarfs to prevent spreading when the ends are welded . The tire is placed on the forge with the ends in the fire and some 4 inches of additional coal is piled over the iron to hold in the heat . When a cherry red is reached , with slow blowing , flux is sprinkled on the scarfed surfaces , and the bellows are pumped slowly until welding heat is reached . At this stage the tire is removed and placed on the anvil where the ends are joined with a few quick blows with a 3- or 4-pound hammer . In welding a tire the smith must be careful not to hit so hard that the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affects the inside circumference and causes a bad fit . It is better to weld it so that the joint is a mite thicker than the original iron , for then the joint can be drawn down to proper size . It is obviously impossible , Figure  | however , to upset a joint to proper thickness once it has been hammered too thin . Shrinking the tire on the wheel is an operation done outside the shop . It requires some special tools and usually several men , although many a country smith with no helper had to do the job by himself . First of all , a circular fire is built on the ground , large enough to lay the tire on it . Then small pieces of firewood are piled above the tire to insure that it heats evenly throughout . The purpose of this fire , of course , is to heat the iron so that it will expand , at which point it is placed on the wheel and cooled to shrink it tightly on the wheel . The smith watches his fire with care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small dry stick . When the tire is heated enough , before it becomes red , the stick suddenly acts as though its end is greased as it is rubbed on the iron , and a slight curl of smoke rises from its end , but there is no flame . This indicates that the tire is ready to be fitted . Figure The tire is then lifted from the fire and carried to the wheel , which has been placed so that its rim rests on a circular platform of brick or stone , with a hole in the center into which the hub is inserted . At times , the platform may be an old millstone . Placing the hot tire in position , the smith then prises it over the rim with a tiredog , or knocks it into place with a  | soft 6- or 8-pound sledge . As the tire is knocked into place the rim smokes and the joints of the wheel crack and groan . Once the tire is put on properly the tire is cooled quickly , either with water poured around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rack , set over a pit of water in which the hot tire is rotated until cool . The cooling brings forth more cracking and groaning from the constricted parts of the wheel , which are now literally bound together with a " hoop of steel . " Figure If properly fitted on a dry wheel , a tire should last until worn through , which may take years . Sometimes , however , a tire is not measured properly and becomes loose in dry weather . Before 1870 this problem could only be solved by removing the tire , cutting it , and rewelding to a slightly smaller size . About 1870 , though , some tool factories began making tire shrinkers , which found a wide market among smiths in America . To shrink a tire without rewelding , the smith first heats  | it to orange-red and hammers a dent in the outside of the tire . Then the tire is placed on the shrinker , which consists of a flat anvil and two heavy arms , which are levered tightly on the tire on either side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dent is then hammered flat , the two arms of the shrinker holding the red-hot iron so tightly that the dent is upset into the thickness of the tire , rather than being merely flattened to its original dimension . Often upsetting makes the tire slightly wider where the dent had been . When this happens , the extra width is cut off with a cold chisel or hot set . Hub bands are measured and welded as though they are miniature tires . Bands , however , are often shaped like the section of a cone , and are often bent around a floor mandrel . Also , bands often are punched in three or four places so that they can be nailed into place . The decade of the 1870s was a period of transition in wagon design and manufacturing technique . During this time , wheels appeared with two steam-bent felloes per wheel , instead of the seven sawn or adzed felloes which had been used since ancient times . Also , wagons were beginning to be equipped with iron or ' steel axles mounted inside a wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This required a cast-iron box , actually a truncated cone , which the smith inserted into the hub as a bearing for the axle . Before steel axles ? until the 1930s on some makes of wagons in America and Europe ? a wooden axle was used , usually a great oaken or hickory or elm beam shaped at each end into a cone . This axle was fitted with a small 8-inch iron bar nailed on the bottom side of each end as a bearing su surface . The hub aperture , inside of the rings , was then fitted with two small bands 1% - inch thick and 1/2 - inch wide , which served as hub bearings . There were many other small pieces of wagon hardware made and fitted by the smith : hinges , rivets , linch pins ,  | Figure braces , bearings , and bands . The smithing techniques used to form and fit such hardware items were generally the same as used for general hardware , and they need not be explained here . Experience teaches better than words . In the latter years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twentieth century , America and Europe had a number of carriage makers in settled areas . They were called buggy factories in the more democratic atmosphere of America , and those of any size employed smiths for welding the iron axles and special tire rims for rubber tires , which went into quality buggies and carriages . Welding buggy axles is an exacting task , requiring that the two conical collared ends , which fit into the hubs , be welded to each end of the 11/2 - inch- square axlebar . First the separate pieces of steel , which , incidentally , are excellent for making various anvil tools and chisel bodies , are brought to welding heat and joined under a trip-hammer . It is de rigueur that the axle be welded totally in one heat , so that any axle that shows the slightest trace of the joint is discarded . Thus smiths , such as Herbert Mitchum of Durand , Georgia , who served their apprenticeships in buggy factories were generally expert welders with high standards . Buggies were tired in the same way as wagons until the  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rubber tires were fitted into a special channel-shaped steel rim which was supplied in 20-foot lengths by the steel mills of the day . Welding with a hammer necessarily destroyed the precise shape of the channel at the joint . Consequently buggy-tire channels were joined with a special set of swages that maintained the shape of the channel during joining . During the decline of general blacksmithing , wholesale hardware houses sold most of the items for wagon hardware that , before 1870 , had been made individually by the smith . Therefore the smith could order his parts as he ordered his tools and merely fit them on . Some smiths still alive , how-Figure  | ever , still made many parts for older wagons during their careers , and a good smith was essential to farming communities until the internal-combustion engine replaced the horse on farms all over the world . Without the smith , all the hardware found in our houses , stores , and offices displays a sameness that fails to arouse the interest found in an old handmade hinge or a specially designed knocker or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , however , increases the respect of modern ironware collectors for the skill and artistry of the old-time smith .  | THE TECHNIQUES OF MAKING HOME UTENSILS While the local blacksmith during his heyday was essential for making and designing the tools of war and industry , he was no less important in supplying the tools of domestic life . The stewards and chefs of noble castles and the housewives of humbler homes were quite as dependent on his skill as the warrior , the woodcutter , the farmer , and the craftsman . Not only was he necessary.for kitchen utensils , but he was needed to provide hair curlers and gophering irons as well . The home , regardless of its relative grandeur , centered around the kitchen fire , which , by the middle of the eighteenth century , had become quite sophisticated in its equipment . Basic among this equipment were firedogs , jacks , and andirons . " Andiron , " of course , is derived from " end ' iron , " an adjunct to the firedogs needed to keep logs from the hearth floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the fire burn brighter . Until casting iron became a practical art and industry in the sixteenth century , firedogs were produced exclusively by the smithy from heavy bars of wrought iron . Seldom were they made of stock less than 1-inch square , and seldom were they ornamented . From the time of their first use sometime in the Dark Ages , firedogs were purely functional , beautiful only in their simplicity and sturdiness . Many rested on three legs , like the later combination of  | andiron and dog . These are made by bending a 3-foot bar about 6 inches from one end to a right angle . The other end is split with a chisel for 61/2 inches , the split is widened to form two legs , and the legs are then bent at a right angle . Another type is made by bending each end at right angles , but pointing in opposite directions . Two additional legs are welded to one of the bends to give support in the front , the original bend serving as a rudimentary andiron , which prevents heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All bending on the heavy iron used for dogs can be done by inserting the bar in a fork inserted in the hardie hole while the iron is at an orange or even a white heat . Andirons , which originally were made of iron , but which eventually were also made of brass , had a functional as well as a decorative purpose . They kept logs in the fire , but they also served to hold spits on which meat was cooked before the fire . Those used in fireplaces for living quarters and bedrooms were usually short , not more than 2-feet tall , with no brackets on which to rest spits ; kitchen andirons , on the other hand , while often decorative , were quite tall , sometimes with several brackets welded or bradded at different heights for the spits . One finds , with only desultory study , that the designs of andirons are as endless as a roll call of all the blacksmiths who made andirons during the development of Western Figure  | civilization . Each pair reflects to some degree the individuality and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most common type found in Colonial and nineteenth-century America was made of a piece of strap iron with two legs fashioned at one end and decorated with a ring or scroll at the other end . Dogs were usually bradded Io the andirons , but often were welded . The material used for making these simple andirons was frequently scrap ; the end cut from a wagon tire being used for the andirons and a worn-out wagon linch pin or the end of a house bolt being utilized for the dogs . To make an andiron the smith takes an 18-inch or 2-foot length of tire a couple of inches wide and 3/s - inch thick . This is heated to an orange-red at one end preparatory to forming the ring . In using mild steel , the hole in the end can be punched , and a shoulder can be formed with a fuller at the point where the ring meets the body of the andiron . Once formed in the rough , the ring may be dressed evenly all around by placing it on Figure  | Figure the horn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a different technique is followed by the discriminating smith to form the ring . To preserve the integrity of the fibers in wrought iron , the smith draws out the end for about 3 inches , making a tang about 1-inch wide , the shoulders being dressed with a fuller . This tang is punched with a 3/s-inch hole at the point that designates the bottom of the ring and is split from this hole to the end . The two legs of the split are then each formed into a semicircle over the horn , with an overlap of 1/4 inch or so . After scarfing the ends , the smith welds them to complete his ring . If he is making them for  | newlyweds , he may form the ring into a heart-shape instead of a circle , or into any sort of shape that suits his fancy . Legs of simple strap andirons are formed by punching the end opposite the ring some 41/2 inches from the end of the strap and splitting from this hole to the end . These legs are spread and shaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset at the end of each leg , or formed by flattening the ends and bending them outward . The most common method of joining andirons and dogs is to punch a hole in the andiron at a height matching the bend in the dog . The end of the dog is heated to a white heat and inserted in the hole , and the slightly protruding end is upset to brad it to the andiron . If welding is considered more finished work than bradding , then the end of the dog opposite the leg must be scarfed for about 4 inches and lapwelded onto the andiron just above the fork in its legs . After welding , the dog can be bent to a right angle to the andiron . There is really no limit to the variety of design already found in handmade andirons or to the potential designs of an imaginative smith . A more graceful andiron than the simple country type made of a strap can be created with 3%-inchsquare bar or rod . Here a bar 3-feet long is used to fashion the firedog and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dog leg , then bending the andiron body in the opposite direction . Next andiron legs of the same-size bar are welded to the body at the bend . If the andiron is to be decorative , the upright portion above the legs may be upset into a button on the end and then formed into a gooseneck . Others may be flattened on the end and a scroll curve formed ; or drawn out into a corkscrew spiral formed around a rod held in the bench vise . Some European smiths , in the best craft traditions of the Middle Ages , might have welded small petals of sheet iron to a button to form full-blown rose blossoms , or other types  | of flowers , on the ends of andirons . Such delicate welding must be done with great care and slow , careful action of the bellows . The button , of course , requires more time in the fire to be brought to welding heat than the petals . Each petal must be placed and welded very quickly before the thin stock loses its welding heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form each petal by flattening the end of a rod and shaping the flat part into the shape of a rose petal . When sufficient petals have been made the ends may be wired around the button on the andiron , and the whole may be brought to welding heat and joined . Often the smith finds it easier , when working with wrought iron , to form his rose blossoms on a short bar , and then to weld this to the body of the andiron . Some andirons are huge and heavy and intricately formed . These types may be made of a 2- or even 3-inch-square bar , Figure  | which is split to form legs , then molded into artistic shapes with hammer and fuller and swage . One method is to form a heavy base from which the legs curve , and to forge the body into a column decorated with molded collars and capped with a large ball or pineapple . When made of 3-inch bar , such shapes can be molded by carefully shaping the top and bottom surfaces of the collars with top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ball on the end is , of course , upset and shaped with a heavy hammer , then given a smooth surface with a light hammer . Final finish to all decorations may be done with a file , although a master smith will disdain the file for all but the finial ball . Other fireplace equipment , such as pokers , shovels , and tongs may also be made in the smithy . Most are made of ii ; ? ' z z inch rod . There are two ways to make a poker with a hook for turning logs . On heavier stock the end may be flattened for 3 or 4 inches and split , one leg of the split being shaped into the hook , the other being drawn out to a point . For a smaller , %xinch rod , however , it is far better to scarf the end and bend it back upon the rod to form a loop some 3 inches long . The scarfed end is welded to the shank of the incipient poker and the loop is cut through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hook , the other the point . Handles for pokers may be formed in a number of different ways . Some merely have a ring for a handle , sometimes welded shut , sometimes not . Most are formed by flattening and shaping the end to a cigar-shape and forging some sort of scroll on the end . Others are upset to thicken the original rod to a comfortable diameter for the hand , then drawn down almost to a point , with a button upset on the point . To follow one of the most common forms of scroll decoration in Colonial times , the smith points the handle , then splits the point for 1% inches . Scrolls are formed on the end of each split , and the scrolls are then bent at right angles  | Figure to the handle . They may be left this way , or they may be hammered at a yellow heat to flatten the top until all traces of the end of the split have disappeared . This leaves the scrolls tight against the sides of the handle . Unlike large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Vs inch or thinner sheet iron . This is cut to fit a pattern the shape of a truncated triangle , 6-inches wide across the base , 6-inches high , and 4-inches wide at the truncation . One inch from each corner of the base the sheet is split 1-inch deep pointing toward the truncation . The end of this split will be the corner after the walls have been bent up and welded . Before shaping the shovel , however , the handle should be welded on . Three-eighths-inch rod , the same as used for the poker and of the same length , is used for the  | shank and handle . First the handle is formed , as was done with the poker . Next the end opposite the handle is upset for 1 inch or faggot-welded for the same length , to form a double thickness . This end is then split with a thin hot chisel for a depth of inch , the split being opened to receive the blade . After heating the split to cherry red , the cold sheet is jambed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the center of the sheet and to hammer the lips tightly together to hold the sheet . Sometimes roughing the small section of the sheet , which will be placed in the handle , with the corner of a cold chisel will provide small teeth which help hold sheet and handle together during welding . Because of the tendency of thin sheet to burn up , the area to he welded must be brought to welding heat slowly and the metal must be watched with care . If both sheet and handle are wrought iron , sand or borax may be used as a flux , being sprinkled into the joint when the metal is cherry red . If mild steel is used , then borax or a patented welding compound is Figure  | required . Once at welding heat , the shovel is removed and joined quickly with a light hammer . After this the blade of the shovel is heated to an orange-red and the back wall and sides are formed over the heel of the anvil . The two projections created by the splits into the base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side wall . They are then welded to the side wall . Finishing is done by curving the handle where it is joined to the blade to make the bottom of the blade parallel to the handle , or at an angle the smith deems appropriate . Some shovels had corners and handles that were bradded instead of . welded . If the handle is to be bradded on , the flat surface at its end should be 3-inches long , and it should be shaped to fit the back and bottom of the already completed shovel blade . Tongs are more complicated to make than pokers or shovels , for they have two movable parts which must fit precisely . Made from the same size rod and of the same length as poker and shovel , tongs , as with shovels , have the handle forged first . Then 1 ? inches below the handle , the rod is bent at right angles to the handle and curved around the horn into a semicircle 2 inches in diameter , then bent again so that the stationary leg of the tongs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two types of lips may be chosen . Often a smith merely flattens the rod for a lip , this being curved inward over the horn . Some , however , may upset the end of the rod into a flat button 3/4 inch in diameter , and the rod is then curved so that the flat surface is parallel to the axis of the leg . Next the shank between semicircle and handle is flattened to a thickness of 3I6 inch , the flat surface extending 11% inches up the shank and the width of the shank extending into the rod forming the semicircle . This is to receive the shank of the movable leg of the tongs . Shoulders should be carefully formed with a set hammer , or if no set hammer is available ,  | with the square end of a bar or on the corner of the anvil . A ' +-inch hole is then drilled , or possibly punched , in the center of this flat surface about ' , / inch from its upper end . In making the movable leg , first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is curved to fit the already-formed stationary leg , with at least a 11/2-inch shank protruding beyond the semicircle at the upper end . This shank is flattened , with the flat surface extending the width of the rod into the top of the semicircle . The flat shank is then cut so that it fits the flat shank of the stationary leg . At this point , it is brought to a yellow heat , quickly fitted to the stationary leg , and a 1A-inch hole is punched in it , using the hole in the stationary leg as a guide . Some smiths prefer to drill the holes in tongs to assure a tight fit when the two legs are bradded together .  | The ' 4-inch rod that holds the legs together may be bradded into large heads on both sides , the heads being dressed smoothly with a file and perhaps decorated with a center punch or a small cold chisel . A better method , though , is to drift out each hole with a tapered punch , punching from the outside so that the hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inside . When this is done , a short piece of 1%-inch rod , slightly longer than the combined width of both shanks , is brought to a white heat and inserted into the two tapered holes . This is pounded with a light hammer until the rod is upset at both ends to fit the tapered holes . The completed tongs are then quenched in the slack tub and the ends of the brad are filed flush with the shank on either side . When the brad cools it contracts sufficiently to allow a free pivot . A smith may vary the details of hearth tools in many ways . He may use square rod instead of round , and give a most decorative twist to his handles if he likes . He may wish to square a section of a round rod and put a double twist in this section . At other times , he may flatten a section in the shank to create a long ellipse , and this may be decorated with center punch , or chisel , or special heart- and star-shaped punches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditions of exquisite craftsmanship and design of hearth tools more closely than the versatile , busy village smiths of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries . Their work may be more appropriately placed in the category of decorative ironwork . The American smith , isolated as he was in the backwoods of the New World , was second to none in devising and making functional tools and implements . It must be said , however , that few Americans were able to import successfully the artistry and craftsmanship of the European ? that infinite capacity for little things which is the mark of genius .  | An essential bit of cooking equipment before 1800 was the fireplace crane , on which pots and kettles were hung over the fire . Many backwoods cabins in America and peasant cots iii Europe had merely a bar of iron set across the back of the fireplace on which pothooks were hung , but on both continents a domestic establishment of any size had its cooking fire equipped with a crane . A crane is no more than a % - inch bar of iron , bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mounted in two rings protruding from the hearth wall so that they may be swung in and out of the fire . Most kitchen fireplaces , though , were quite large ? sizable enough in medieval castles to roast a whole ox in the kitchen ! Those in the larger farmhouses of America and the manor houses of Europe were generally about 6-feet wide and about 3-feet cire1 ) . Cranes for these fireplaces had to be more elaborate than bent bars .  | Larger cranes follow the principle of a bar bent at right angles , but with the refinements of pivot pins at both ends of the upright and a brace welded across the right angle to provide strength . To make one , the smith must acquire a bar 11/2-inches square for his upright ; he then forms 1-inch tenons 11/2-inches long on each end , drawing the round tenons. out of the bar with a set hammer , or if so equipped , with a large 1-inch round swage . The shoulders may be further squared with a small fuller or with a monkey tool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bar for the upright , the ends being tenoned , as with the bar . There are several ways for welding the horizontal arm to the pivot bar . Cross welding , or crossing the fibers of the iron , is not generally supposed to make as good a weld as lap welding , where the fibers in the joint coincide . It may be used in welding cooking cranes , however , because the diagonal brace provides extra strength to the whole . A better method is to split the upright about 2 or 3 inches from the top tenon . The horizontal bar , generally a bar 1/2 inch by 11/2 or 2 inches , is then scarfed at one end on both sides and is inserted in this split , where it is welded . Still another method , per-Figure  | Figure haps the best of the three , is to elongate the top tenon so that its length is 11/2 inches longer than the width of the horizontal bar . The horizontal bar is drawn down in thickness to 1/4 inch on one end , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long scarf on the last 11/2 inches , the bar is wrapped around the tenon , just as in making a hinge pin , and is welded . After welding , it may be dressed to the same size as the upright , its shoulders , where the lap weld occurs , being dressed with a set hammer or on the corner of the anvil .  | Braces , made of a bar as large as the horizontal bar or perhaps a bit smaller , are prepared by scarfing both ends and lap welding the ends to horizontal and upright . In fancier households served by an artistic smith , the brace is sometimes decorated with scrolls , and variously shaped punched holes and designs are applied with center punch and chisel . Scrolls at the center and ends may be made of separate small bars welded to the brace and then scrolled ; some can be made of a small split bar cross-welded at the butt to the brace , and scrolled ; others may be formed by splitting a portion of the end for 3 or 4 inches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of braced crane that has no upright , only a horizontal bar bent at one end to insert in a ring in the hearth wall , with a brace that has its end inserted into a bottom ring . These cranes are made either by welding the brace to the horizontal or by splitting the horizontal for 18 inches or so at one end and bending half the split down at a 45-degree angle to form the brace . Ends of Figure  | both horizontal and brace are tenoned and bent to a position perpendicular to the horizontal bar . There are examples of quite complicated adjustable cranes , on which the height and angle of the horizontal bar and its length may be changed at will . Examples of such complicated devices are rare , mostly English in origin . The common kitchen attained the same results with a combination of pothooks and adjustable trammels . Pothooks are probably the simplest of all fireplace cooking utensils . Otis Hall , who worked with his grandfather , Henry Ison , a Negro smith of Spalding County , Georgia , remembers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rural shop . He made them of 1/4 - inch rod bent to oppositely directed semicircles at either end . Figure Trammels , which were found in two main forms , were a bit more involved to make . Possibly the simplest form consisted of a flat bar from 12- to 15-inches long , 1/4 - inch thick , and 3/4- to 1-inch wide . An old , worn horseshoe was easily converted to these dimensions when rolled bars were in short supply . To make a trammel , this bar is drawn out on the end to a 1/4 - inch- square tang 3- or 4-inches long . The body is then punched with a 1/4-inch punch at intervals of 1 inch , starting with a hole centered only % inch from the flat end . The tang is bent into a hook on its end , and the flat end is bent to a right angle , opposite to the hook , at a point 3/4 inch from its end . Now the second part is made from 1/4-inch rod about  | 3 inches longer than the distance between the first and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is slightly flattened at one end for 1% inches and is curved into a hook . The other end is bent to a right angle in the opposite direction and is inserted through the hole in the right-angle bend of the flat bar ; then it is inserted in any of the other holes desired to hold a kettle the proper distance over the fire . Height is adjusted by reinserting the right-angle bend of the lower rod to any other hole in the upper bar . A more easily adjusted trammel may be made from two ' A - inch bars from 3%-inch to 11/2-inches wide and 9- or 10-inches long . Each is drawn down to a 1% - inch tang 4- or 5-inches long which extends up one side of the bar rather than in its center . One of these bars is then serrated with file or fuller to form notches , every inch or so , on the side of the bar opposite the tang . This will be the lower portion , with the tang being bent on its end to form a small hook on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of this bar the smith welds or brads a thin stationary keeper extending opposite the serrated edge far enough for the upper bar to slide easily inside it . Now the tang at the top of the unserrated half is formed into a hook by which the whole affair hangs from the crane . This portion requires a thin , pivoted keeper , bradded loosely to it near the bottom outside edge . Both keepers may be formed over the basic trammel stock of thin iron bar about 1/s x 1 inch in size . Bradding must be done after the upper bar is inserted through the keeper on the lower bar . The pivoted keeper , of course , fits into the notches on the lower part , thus making the lower hook adjustable in height from the crane . When assembled , both tangs should be on adjacent edges . Trammels may be decorated with heart- or star-shaped holes , and designs may be applied with center punch and chisel .  | Figure Trivets and roasters , made by the local or the castle smith , were as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grill in the oven is to modern cooks . Most were small simple grills mounted on three legs and made of heavy-enough iron to hold up under the heat of the fire for at least a generation . Trivets were stationary , while roasters often rotated on their stands to turn the roasting meat toward the blaze for even cooking .  | A trivet , named because of its three legs , is essentially no more than a circle of iron to which three legs and a handle are welded or , in many cases , riveted . To make one the smith requires an iron bar 1A-inch thick and of any width up to 1 inch . He forges this into a ring over the horn of the anvil and , after scarfing the ends , welds them together . In early America , when swains were wont to take practical gifts to their intended , or were called upon to make the kitchen equipment for an approaching marriage , they made heart-shaped trivets to show their love . These may be made in two pieces , each formed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at the top . Often the legs of trivets are bradded on , and the handle , when a handle is used , is frequently an extension of one of the legs . The better trivets , however , have the legs made of a small bar or rod welded to the ring . This is done with a cross weld on the two front legs . The rear leg and handle are formed together , the leg being bent at a right angle before the piece is cut to proper length . The handle portion is flattened to /-inch thickness and carefully shaped to fit the hand and is usually given a hook on the end for hanging up when not in use . Common trivet plates consist of a plain ring ; or a ring which has crossbars or interior , shaped , projections welded to it to support smaller pots . Some , though , are triangular , being made from small square or rectangular stock , the legs formed by doubling the stock and faggot welding it in three places to form a triangle , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Roasters are made similarly to trivets , but in two parts , the ring , which rotates , and the three-legged stand . The ring , since it is designed to set a roast or ham upon it , always has a grill , and frequently a rather fancy grill . It is made of straight bars , an alternation of straight and serpentine  | Figure bars , two crossbars with scrolls , or a series of concentric rings fastened to the outer ring with crossbars . Roasters always have a flat surface in the center of the ring which is punched for the brad around which the ring rotates . Roaster stands are made from a flat bar 1-inch wide , ' /s - inch to 1/4-inch thick , and about 15-inches long , the length depending on the diameter of the rotating ring . The bar is first drawn down to a long point which extends 4 to 6 inches tip the bar . This is split down the middle and spread so that the two sides form a 60-degree angle . The handle is shaped and fashioned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends of  | Figure the split are bent into right angles to form legs at a distance equal to the radius of the ring , and feet may be formed on the legs if desired . The third leg is then formed and welded or bradded to the base of the handle the same distance from the fork as the right-angle bend in the legs . Of course , the base of the third leg is scarfed before welding . A 1/4-inch hole is punched in the base of the handle with its center 1/2 inch from the fork of the two front legs . A brad joining the ring and stand completes the roaster . The practical smith soon discovers that the various dimensions of handcrafted wrought-iron items are always relative rather than standard . The diameter of a roaster ring , for instance , would be determined by the size of the roasts generally prepared by the customer . The distance of the legs from the center brad must always relate to the size of the ring . Handles may be long or short depending on the depth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height of firedogs , the depth of coals used by a particular cook , and perhaps other factors peculiar to cook and fire . Thus each piece of iron equipment is as individual in its shape and dimen-  | sions as the person who uses it . The relative dimensions of each piece gives almost perfect proportions and functional beauty that can not be matched by any utensil designed to be mass-produced on the basis of economical production , easy packing , and modish design , rather than efficient use by a specific person . Perhaps the most interesting and beautiful kitchen utensils made by smiths in every area were the forks and spoons and spatulas which hung on kitchen walls and fireplaces of Williamsburg and old Augsburg , of Edinburgh and Stockholm . Many of these relatively small , generally graceful tools were doubtless made on a farm forge on a wintry day , but most , as with nearly all ironwork , were made by the village smith or his more artistic apprentices . Practically every technique used in ironworking is needed to turn out a set of hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make . Because of their delicacy and the ill effects of flaws in the iron , only the best Swedish or Lancashire iron was used for these smaller pieces in the heyday of smithing . Forks , often called toasting forks , are probably the most graceful and most interesting of these relics of fireplace  | cookery . They may be made of % - inch or 1/2 - inch rod or bar from 12- to 18-inches long , depending on use and need . When round or square bar rod is used the best method of making a fork is to weld one end of the rod into a loop some 2 inches long , as when making a hooked poker . The loop is then cut through . The resulting legs are spread and each is drawn out to a point . Usually the legs are spread to a 90 ? angle to allow them to be worked easily on the face of the anvil . After drawing out , the tines are shaped over the end of the anvil horn . The end of the rod opposite the tines may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the rod is large enough , flattened to form a comfortable handle . An attractive small cooking fork can be made from % x ' /z inch bar . First the bar is fullered , either with %-inch top and bottom fullers or with two lengths of %-inch rod , which serves as a most effective expedient when fullers are unavailable . Below the fullering the bar is drawn to a point which is split to form the tines . Tines may be spread , worked and finally shaped exactly as those on a fork made from rod . Next the stock above the fullering is drawn out to shape the handle , the fullering giving graceful definition to the point where the handle spreads into the tines . When drawing out the handle the shank will become thicker . This thickness must be left to provide strength to the shank . Such a fork may be finished by drilling a hole in the end of the handle , shaping the end into a hook , or off-setting the last %-inch to form a spur about % - inch long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the handle to form a loop for hanging . The last step in making a fork is to bend the tines downward and then in the opposite direction to form the graceful curve which makes the utensil both beautiful and efficient in form . Small forks should have slightly curved handles . Large ones may be finished with a straight handle . Many old continental forks would have flat handles pierced with decorative punches .  | Figure It is important to shape tines only while the iron is quite hot . Better to reheat than to hammer cold and see one of the tines suddenly break off because of unnoticed strain in the fibers at the right-angle bend . Neither mild steel nor hot iron should be hammered at a blue heat . A nice decoration for a fork of this sort is to put a twist in the shank about 2 inches above the tines . To do this the portion to be twisted is heated to an even orange-red or yellow . One end of the heated portion is quickly placed in the  | vise , and the twist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion with tongs and giving either a half or a whole twist . All twisting must be finished in one heat , otherwise it will twist unevenly . If , as sometimes happens , twisting puts a crook in the shank , this can be straightened by pounding with a lead hammer , a wooden mallet or maul , or with a block of wood , while the shank rests on another block of wood placed on the anvil face . There are other forms of forks , of course . Some have a flat shank on which are filed hearts or stars or circles or ovals . Handles are decorated with variously shaped punches or with designs applied with center punch or chisel . Larger forks , the ones long enough to turn over meat in a frying pan without stooping , may have three tines instead of two . To make these , the smith may follow the procedure for making two-tined forks , except that he forges the end to be split at least 3/4 - inch wide at the base and splits it twice , bending the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tine is cut off to match the length of the outside tines after they are bent . Some smiths used a hacksaw to split the tines , after this convenient tool was developed at the end of the eighteenth century , but splitting with a chisel is easier and somehow handsomer . Often the smith may weld on the outside tines of a threetined fork . Some may wish to weld a straight bar at right angles to the shank , then bend them to proper shape . A better way , however , is to lap-weld the ends of two straight bars to the shank and , after welding , shape these into the outside tines . A lap weld always provides more strength than a cross weld . Among the relics exhibited at Old Brunswick , near Wilmington , North Carolina , are the two outside tines of a large cooking fork . It is obvious that these were cross-welded to the shank , but the smith got a " cold shut " instead of a good joint , and his fork became no more than a skewer.  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natural , graceful curves put into tines and shank as the last step of manufacture . Curving , of course , is done over the horn , generally with a light hammer . First the shank , just above the separation of the tines , is curved downward until the tines point to a 60-degree angle from the shank . Then the tines , just below the parting , are bent 60 degrees or so in the opposite direction so that their angle points 30 degrees above the shank . It is up to the smith to decide which portion of the horn will provide the proper arc to these curves to bring both beauty and functional efficiency to forks of various lengths . Spoons and ladles and spatulas are made in a manner similar to forks , but usually in two pieces that are welded or bradded together . Handles and shanks are made exactly as are forks ; only the triangular portion reserved for the tines is left off . Instead , the butt of the shank is slightly flattened for no more than 1/2 inch . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 1/2 inch toward the shank . Spoon and ladle bowls and spatula blades are roughly cut to shape from thin sheet iron before welding to the handle . Once cut to rough shape with hand shears or bench shears , they are jambed into the split , while the split is orange-red , and the lips of the split are hammered tightly around the base of the bowl or blade . Some smiths use a center punch or key chisel to rough up the part of bowl or blade that is inserted into the shank . This forms small teeth which help keep the two pieces in position while welding . Welding must be done slowly , the bellows being worked with a delicate touch , to prevent the thin sheet iron from burning away where it - is to join the thicker shank . While being brought to welding heat the spoon or spatula should be turned regularly to absorb heat evenly , and the small pointed poker should be used frequently to determine when the metal becomes tacky , or molten enough , to be joined . Very  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is better to sprinkle borax , sand , or salt on the joint when it reaches cherry-red heat . As soon as proper heat is reached for welding , the iron is taken from the fire and is joined with a light hammer . Shaping spoon and ladle bowls may be done in several ways . The easiest is to use a swage block that has the properly shaped depression for spoon or ladle . The orange-red sheet is placed over the depression and formed with the pein of a ballpein hammer . Some smiths follow the techniques of the coppersmith and silversmith and have a special anvil stake with a rounded face , the other end of which fits into the hardie hole . The red-hot bowl piece is placed over this and shaped with glancing blows of the hammer , which forms the bowl without the wavy surface caused by a ball pein . The smith who has neither swage block nor stake can hollow the bowl Figure  | by hammering the hot metal on the anvil face with the pein of a ball-pein hammer . Where a swage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a block of wood , the hammer and hot iron making its own very satisfactory depression . Also , a ball-pein hammer placed in the vise serves as an excellent substitute for a round-faced stake anvil . After forming , the edges of the bowl are dressed with shears or file . Spatula blades need only be scarfed on the front edge . This is done on the rounded edge of the anvil face , or top of the horn . After forming the bowl of spoons , ladles , and so on , the shank is heated orange-red and twisted to match the fork . Then the curves of shank and bowl are formed . Colanders and other types of strainers are made exactly as are spoons and ladles except that small holes are punched in the bowl after it has been formed . Often spoons and colanders , in Colonial days , had the bowls bradded to the shank . This is done by punching two brad holes in the shank and using these as a guide to punch matching holes in the bowl or spatula blade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece completely before bradding them together . Brads are always used to join iron handles and copper or brass spoon bowls . The smith who makes utensils of two different metals will find it sensible to have his brads of the softer metal . They are more easily replaced when wear makes the joint loose , and they do not enlarge the brad holes in either iron or softer material . Among the more attractive and interesting items made for the kitchen by medieval and later smiths were meat skewers and skewer holders . The skewers , in simplest form , are only l - inch or 3is-inch rods or square bars 7- or 8-inches long and drawn out to a point on one end . The other end is generally formed into a 1-inch-diameter circle  | which is sometimes welded shut , but usually not . Since skewers were brought to the festive table stuck into the roast , however , the proud Colonial housewife or chatelaine liked to have a number of well-made decorative skewers with which to enhance her status as a hostess . Consequently , she usually had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks and twisting . One beautiful skewer illustrated in Wallace Nutting 's Furniture Treasury is decorated with a double twist . This may be put into a square skewer by heating the shank orange-red , placing it diagonally in the corner of the vise , so that the vise jaws cover no more than about 1/4 inch of the shank , and quickly twisting each end in the same direction for half a twist . Again the smith must be careful to heat the entire shank evenly or his twists will be unevenly formed . Concomitant with attractive skewers were attractive skewer holders . In humble kitchens they might have been hung on a peg or nail driven into the wall . In more affluent households , though , the kitchen was usually equipped with a wrought-iron skewer holder which hung on the wall near the hearth . Normal skewer holders may be made of sheet iron 1/s - inch to 1/4 - inch thick . A favorite design is a heart-shape with two prongs extending to either side from the point of the heart . This design is first roughly cut with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body of the heart left somewhat thicker than its final intended shape . The sheet is then brought to an orange-red and the thickened sides of the heart are split 1/4 inch from the edges to within 1/4 inch of the point to form two prongs . These are bent down until they  | Figure are at right angles to the vertical axis of the heart , then curved forward slightly with an additional gentle curve upward on the ends . The heart itself is punched at the top for hanging on a nail , and perhaps decorated with center punch or chisel . A tool essential to any well-run household in olden days , as in many modern households , was scissors . A woman , in the days when all domestic tools were handmade , was as proud of the quality of her favorite sewing scissors as her  | husband was of his favorite shotgun . To make a fine pair of scissors by hand indeed required as much skill and care as did the gun . The first steel , one may remember , was described as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scissors and shears . Good scissors did not wear out . In Europe they were generally made in the specialized shops of cutlers , who made only shears , fine knives , swords , and the like . In America they were provided by the general blacksmith , some of whom , because of their skill , devoted more time to fine articles such as sewing scissors . Sump Brown , the smith of Cobb County , Georgia , has a pair that belonged originally to his great-great-grandmother , a Cherokee woman who lived in Cobb County before the Removal Treaty of 1836 . These are made of high-grade wrought iron with a thin piece of steel , only ' A 6-inch thick , welded to the blade for a cutting surface . To make scissors of this sort the smith first welds his two metals together . This must be done with extreme care so as not to burn the thin steel . To make a pair of sewing scissors 4-inches long requires a bar of flat iron 1/s - inch thick , 1/4 - inch wide , and 41/2 - inches long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V16-inch thick , lie-inch wide , and 2- to 3-inches long . Unless the smith particularly wants the steel to extend beyond the blade into the handle , he must weld each blade separately . This is done by placing the narrower steel down the center of the iron and clamping the two pieces together with tongs held shut with a tong ring , the tongs holding no more than % inch of the iron and steel . Of course , the length of the iron intended for the handle extends some 2 inches beyond the steel . When the two pieces are clamped tightly they are placed high in the fire , the iron on the bottom , and the bellows are gently pumped . Flux is sprinkled liberally between and over the pieces when they reach cherry-red heat , after which they  | Figure are placed in the fire again , iron on the bottom , until welding heat is reached . As soon as the steel turns from white to the greasy , liquid yellow which denotes welding heat , the two pieces are quickly removed and joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than for steel , the smith in joining the two metals generally follows the steel , particularly when very thin steel is welded . Joining can be done with rapid blows from a light hammer , but often the smith will find it more satisfactory to join such thin stock by placing the set hammer on the pieces and giving it a good blow with a 6-pound sledge . After welding , while the iron is still hot , the joined pieces are cut off on the hardie at the end of the weld adjacent to the end of the tongs . Next the handle is shaped by drawing out the iron that projects beyond the steel into a long taper . The finger hole is formed around the tip of the horn and welded shut with a lap weld . The blade is then carefully drawn out to a point , taking care that the steel is not twisted into the iron . The blade is chamfered on the side intended for the cutting edge by holding it on the edge of the anvil and forming a shouldered chamfer with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with even blows , otherwise it may warp when hardened . Then the handle shank is curved and the finger hole dressed to a circle or an oval or a pointed oval , depending on the smith 's taste . Holes for the brad , or in later times a screw , are drilled , countersunk , and , when necessary , threaded with a tap . When a screw is used , the hole to be threaded must be smaller than the other hole by twice the depth of the intended thread , and  | the screw is threaded only on its end to the thickness of the hole . Scissors , especially small sewing scissors , are always finished carefully with a fine file . After the shape has been dressed up the metal is polished by rubbing the file sideways , or perpendicular to its long axis , over every surface . Final polishing is done with an emery cloth or a paste of emery powder and oil , rubbed on with a soft rag or a piece of leather . Before bradding or screwing together , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in oil or brine for hardening . Some smiths may temper to a brown or straw yellow after hardening , but this is not essential ; the iron backing will prevent the hardened steel from chipping . After tempering , the scissors are again polished with emery . Pipe tongs went out of use about the end of the eighteenth century . Before then , after tobacco had become part of everyday custom in every part of the Western world , pipe tongs graced many a fashionable hearth and were considered utensils ; but because they held a prominent position in the sitting room , they were usually finely made and nicely decorated , giving them a position midway between utensils and decorative ironwork . Most pipe tongs are from 18 to 20 inches in overall length and made of round or square section 1/4 - inch rod or bar . Unlike blacksmith 's tongs , most pipe tongs do not cross at the pivot , but are designed to open when the handles are pressed together , and to close automatically with a spring when the handles are released . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one some 25-inches long , the other 30 to 32 inches . Twenty inches from the end of each he welds a small boss which is no more than a section of the original stock . It is easier to form these by welding the end of a long section at the proper point for about 1/2 inch and by cutting the excess beyond the weld off on the hardie . One of  | these bosses is drawn down to a 1/4-inch thickness , using a set hammer on the edge of the anvil face to form good shoulders . The other is split down to the original rod and the lips of the split are drawn out over a chisel edge , each to about 1/16 inch , to form two thin studs . The channel between these is widened and its bottom flattened by hammering the end of 1/4 - inch- by1- inch flat bar into the channel while the iron is orange-red . The two lips are then hammered around the end of the bar to make them parallel . These two bosses , the single fitting into the double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the portion of the short bar above the boss may be slightly flattened for one handle . Then at a point some 3 1/2 Figure  | inches below the boss , a 11/2 - inch- diameter half-circle is formed in the rod on the same plane as the boss and on the opposite side of the shank . The straight extension of the shank below the half-circle should bend about 10 degrees in from the axis of the rod between half-circle and boss . Opposite the handle , the end of the shank is then either upset to form a button , which is flattened , or the rod is flattened to % - inch width . The end of the rod is then curved inward . Forming the other portion of the pipe tongs is identical to the first from the boss downward . Its handle , though , is quite different . This handle is first upset on its end to form a button , which may be flattened somewhat so that it is suitable to tamp tobacco in a pipe . Then the handle is bent in a curve to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle on the other piece . It is then bent again in the opposite direction , some 4 inches from the first bend , to another 60-degree angle . Both bends must he in the same plane as the half-circle . A flat tapered spring about 3-inches long and 1/4 - inch wide shaped like an elongated " S " is forged , and a 1/s - inch hole is drilled % inch from the thick end . This spring is hardened by heating to cherry red and quenching in oil or brine and the temper drawn to a pigeon blue ; or the correct temper may be attained by covering the hardened spring with the soot from a burning splinter of pine , then laying on a red-hot bar . The moment the soot is burned off the spring is quenched in oil , which gives it proper temper . A 1/8 - inch hole is then drilled in either handle , its direction parallel to the boss , and the spring is bradded to one handle so that it presses the other outward . Most pipe tongs also had a built-in pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips of the tongs in alignment . Resembling a long nail , this pick is a piece of iron 1/4 - inch wide , 1/s - inch thick , and 3-inches long , drawn out to  | a fine point . Its butt end has a 1/8 - inch tenon formed on it for % inch , which is inserted in a 1/8-inch hole drilled in either leg of the tongs halfway between the pivot and the half-circle . The other leg has a hole , large enough to allow the pick to slide easily into it , punched in the opposite leg , in alignment with the drilled hole . The tenon of the pick is inserted in the drilled hole and bradded tightly , and the pick is curved in the proper arc to allow it to slide easily in the punched hole when the tongs are opened and closed . A properly made pair of pipe tongs could have been turned out in the old days only by a smith who knew his business . Because they were special , luxury items , the smith seldom turned them over to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth , and polished with emery . Often these interesting items are decorated with punch marks or chasing with a small graver . There are several additional forms of pipe tongs . Some of them are miniature versions of fire tongs , and some consist of two simply made legs joined by an almost circular spring welded to the butt of the legs . These are no problem to make , once a smith has mastered the design and manufacture of the classic type described above . The housewives and cooks of all ages have used a far greater variety of cooking and household utensils than have been treated in this chapter . Indeed , no aspect of ironworking is more interesting than the making of the commonplace , dayby-day hand appliances of a simpler day . It is probable that the smith invented many of these utensils , and the sense of design of certain individual smiths , most of them totally unknown to history , provided a grace and satisfaction to kitchen utensils that is almost entirely lost in this day of total massmanufacturing.  | IRON AMENITIES , PLAIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man has depended on the blacksmith for his necessities of civilized life , his tools and utensils and transportation . When life became a little easier because of iron , man turned to his local smith for what may be termed the material amenities of living . These include the comfort and convenience of lighting appliances and the durable security of iron window grills , sturdy gates , and unassailable fences . Working within this field the smith evolved from mere craftsman to fine artist , meeting the challenge of iron in delicate and exquisite , and at times quite incredible , sculptured designs which provided aesthetic satisfaction as well as functional value . An artist-smith can only be the product of general affluence combined with a feeling of individuality among the affluent classes . Thus the unbelievably intricate and beautiful wrought ironwork which has come down from the prosperous Renaissance of Italy , the gold-filled colonial period of Spain , the profitable medieval trade of the Hanseatic cities , the long imperial years of Britain , and the leisurely and relatively simple affluence of Colonial America . Such artistic ironwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new development in smithing , but a reflection of the standards set . by ancient Hephaestus , the legendary prototype of all the smiths who followed him . 282  | Hephaestus , crippled and ugly as he was , would never have been granted divinity had he concentrated his skill only on tools and utensils . His status came to him because he was capable of making four golden handmaidens to help him at his forge . Such a feat was art , not trade , and art which was never duplicated in all the thousands of years which followed his legend . The closest subsequent blacksmiths came to emulating the God of Craftsmen was in creating a wrought-iron blacksmith that struck a miniature anvil to mark the hours for the town clock of a late-medieval German town . The smith of medieval Wales would never have been accorded a place equal to that of the priest and the poet in the Prince 's court had his work been confined to horseshoes and billhooks . It was the armor , the finely decorated weapons , the elaborate and tasteful wrought-iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without the technical skill and artistic imagination of the smith , the Prince himself could not have enjoyed the recognition that the ownership of unique ironwork conferred upon him . Creative art , however , was undoubtedly the result of working iron , not the cause . Most successful smiths throughout the long and progressive age of hand-forged iron were , it may be presumed , thoughtful men of vision and foresight , men several intellectual cuts above the craftsmen in other fields who worked mainly by rote , however skillfully . The smith , even for the simplest job , never smote his iron twice with exactly the same blow , and his material , heating in the forge to a plastic state and cooling on the anvil , was never constant for a second as it was being worked under the hammer . These very qualities of obduracy , inconstancy , and plasticity of iron are fascinating to the ironworker , the smiter , the smith . The inconstant hot iron provides a constant challenge . Once forming a simple item is well-learned , the challenge to do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | is intellectually equipped to become a master and an artist . The challenge of the smith , however , is somewhat different from that of artists in most other mediums . Other artists must work with their material as it is , shaping wood or marble or applying paint in an imaginative manner . The smith , on the other hand , may change the basic shape and , as with springs , the quality of his material as required , provided he has the skill and judgment needed . Other artists are somewhat limited in the tools they use , but the blacksmith can make new tools to create the effect he envisions . The challenge he accepted so eagerly has happily resulted in the often remarkable examples of decorative ironwork found in lamps and chandeliers , gates and fences , all over the Western world . Lighting appliances as a group are the best examples of small pieces of decorative ironwork , though in England and America their forms did not often assume the Baroque elaboration of items found in Spain and Italy . The simplest of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the American frontier and in the unassuming cots and farmhouses of England , Scotland , Ireland , and the Continent . Few rushlights could ever be classed as decorative ; they were purely functional , but they may be classed an amenity . They serve as a good starting point for describing the techniques of making more elaborate lighting appliances . Actually the rushlight is no more than a small pair of pliers or tongs , modified so that one handle is attached to a standard of wood or iron , and the other is curved and weighted to automatically close the jaws to hold a rushwick . For wooden standards , the upright shank is tapered to a point on its end so that it can be stuck into a block of wood . The shank of the other jaw may be curved outward to supply leverage to keep the jaws closed , or , if more weight is needed , its end may be doubled back and welded or upset into a ball or teardrop.  | Some rushlights may be designed for double duty . Instead of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may have a candleholder . This may be formed by two methods . The rod of which the shank is made may be drawn out to a thin wedge-shaped plate which is formed on an anvil hick into a long cone , and its edges may be welded together . If the rod is too small for flattening , a wedge shape may he cut from thin sheet iron , which is then formed into a cone shape on the hick . This cone is jambed at its point onto the handle and is welded , first at the point and then along the edges of the sheet . Since the thin sheet will not hold welding heat too long , usually it is necessary to weld the point of the cone to the shank with one heat , and to bring the piece to a second welding heat to join the seam . The two sections of a rush amp are held together with a brad , exactly as the jaws of tongs are joined .  | Iron candleholders may be made in a variety of forms , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various types of holders designed to hook on shelves or the backs of chairs . Candlesticks in simplest forms may be made by welding a socket on the end of a 1/4 - inch rod , as on the shank of a rushlight , with the pointed end of the stick to be inserted in a wooden standard . Fancier standards are made by welding two or three additional short pieces of bar to the end , flattening and scrolling the ends of each , and spreading them to provide a secure standard . Tripod standards may be formed and welded from the same piece of stock from which the candlestick is made , thus avoiding the need for jump welding . This is done by measuring the intended length of the candlestick above the standard and marking the point with a centerpunch . Below this mark the stock is cut to provide a length three times that of the legs . The leg portion is then bent at a point equal to the length of one leg and doubled back once more so that the end of the rod reaches the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the centerpunch . After welding the first bend is cut , forming three equal lengths which are formed into the tripod standard . Ends of the legs may be flattened , scrolled or made into dragon 's feet . There are a number of modern artists in iron who produce beautiful candlesticks of contemporary design . Many of these are made of heavy 1-inch or larger stock . Most have heavy drip pans , usually electric-welded to the upright and with a point instead of a socket for the candle . Standards may be formed from the basic stock , by perhaps splitting and forming , or may be formed with a forge butt weld or an electric or acetylene weld ; later dressed carefully with hammer and file . Such modern candlesticks may have the basic design enhanced by forging certain forms , by fullering , by glass inlays and by inlaying with silver , copper or brass wire , or even gold wire .  | Decorating with hammer , trip-hammer or fuller can easily be accomplished by a smith who has a sense of design and proportion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Inlaying , however , with glass or metal or enameling , requires experience . Written directions can only direct , not demonstrate . Iron a 1/ : - inch or more thick , so as to be inflexible , is re ( luired for glass inlaying . It may be punched or split to receive the glass , which may be small pieces of broken bottles , either clear or colored . Glass should be inlayed over a smooth iron plate , working with an acetylene or propane torch . First the iron , with small chips of glass placed in the opening , is laid on the plate and brought to a bright red with the torch . At this time it begins to become plastic with heat from the torch . As the glass becomes molten it is packed into the opening with the pein of a ballpein hammer or a short thick rod which has been rounded on Figure  | its end by forging or grinding . When the glass has been packed into one side the iron is turned over and the glass packed on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to the forge fire for slow cooling . Small flakes of glass around the edge of the opening usually pop off , but this does not affect the beauty of the inlay . Sometimes , with care , it is possible to mold the glass into a convex surface which extends above the flat surface of the iron . Such molding provides a jewellike effect that is well worth the extra effort . Inlaying with wire follows the practice of ancient peoples , particularly the Vikings , who made battle-axes beautiful in this manner . The process essentially consists of chiseling a " V " - shaped channel , cutting keys into the sides of the channel and then hammering wire of softer metal into the keyed channel . Chisels may be made from various-sized punches or carbon steel rods . They are ground or swaged to a " V " shape with the end ground to about a 4,5 ? angle . Cutting chisels are tempered to a straw color and then further ground on the bottom of the cutting angle to a slight curve . It is important , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , undeterminable curve . Channels are cut by striking the chisel with a hammer of appropriate weight , the cut being guided by the hand . Keys are made by undercutting the sides of the channel with the same chisel , or by using a flat chisel driven squarely into the sides . Enameling iron , which provides colorful highlights to flower petals , leaves or grooves , follows exactly the technique of enameling copper . Heat may be provided with a torch or kiln . Sconces of wrought iron are a feature of lighting appliances found in every type of house from castles to cots from medieval times to mid-nineteenth century in all parts of the Western world . They evolved from the medieval brackets and  | Figure iron baskets which were attached to stone walls to hold torches and pine knots . Brackets are basically no more than iron rings , 3 or 4 inches in diameter , welded at a 45-degree irngle to a short bar which attaches to the wall . Baskets are no more than iron containers made of thin flat iron , usually bradlded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plate fastened to the wall . Baskets may also be mounted with a long rod welded to the bottom and bent at a right angle to insert into the mortar of the wall , or when sharpened , to he driven dii cctly into the heavy wooden frame of a manor house . Often brackets and baskets are welded or hradded to an extension of  | Figure the wall plate , which is bent at a 45-degree angle . No special instruction is needed to make such an appliance in its simplest form . Experience and time , more than instruction , are needed to duplicate some of the quite remarkable brackets and lighting baskets of the Italian Renaissance . These consist of a number of elaborate pieces joined together by welding or riveting and decorated with truly sculptured dragons , griffons , and eagles . No two highly decorative items were ever alike , but many shared various decorative devices such as dragons ' heads , animal heads , snakes , incised rings , and twisted rods . Decorated rings must have the decoration applied before the ring is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on top and bottom . Scallops are formed with a fuller while the iron is at an orange or white heat , the position of each scallop having been drawn on the iron before heating with a soapstone pencil , and the points of impact for the fuller marked with a light chisel cut or a center punch .  | As fullering one edge will extend the length of the iron , curving it , as when a knife blade is drawn out , the iron , as with a knife , must be curved over the horn so that the edge to he fullered is concave when only one edge is to be scalloped . This compensating curve is formed , of course , after the design has been marked on the iron . When both edges are to be scalloped , no compensating curve is necessary ; fullering both edges is compensation enough . Problems , however , arise in scalloping the second edge without battering the first into a shapeless mass . A set of top and bottom matching fullers is needed . When the iron is brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has been previously scalloped in the slack tub , holding it in the water to a depth that reaches only slightly above the bottom curves of the scallop . Then , working quickly , he Figure  | places the iron so that the bottom fuller fits into a finished scallop and forms the top scallop in the hot half of the iron with a top fuller . If , by chance , a bottom fuller is unavailable , the horn of the anvil can be substituted , provided it fits the top fuller adequately . After scallops have been formed the curved edges may be dressed with a light hammer to remove any thickening of the iron at the bottoms of the scallops . Flat decoration , zigzag , straight , or serpentine indentations , punching , or dotting are applied with small fullers , chisels , or punches . Next , the ring is scarfed for welding and formed . To protect the decoration , the iron should be heated to an even white heat and bent into circular shape by using a fork placed in the hardie hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid mutilating the surface of the ring , however , the smith should round the inside corners of the fork before bending the ring . Bending is simply accomplished by inserting one scarfed end of the iron into the fork and carefully bending around with tongs until the scarfs on both ends meet . Rings may be formed over the horn , but the smith must use a copper hammer or even a heavy wooden mallet to avoid marking the decorated surface . After forming , the scarfs are brought to welding heat and the ends joined over the horn of the anvil . Instead of using a hammer to join the ends , the meticulous smith will use the square end of a large iron bar , 1/2 - inch thick and as wide as the ring . The end of the bar is placed quickly on the scarfs after they are brought to the sparkling incandescence of welding heat , and the bar is hit once or twice with a 4-pound hammer to join the ends of the ring . The last step is to continue the design over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Often torch brackets and knot baskets are fastened to decorated rings on a stone pillar , instead of to a wall plate .  | These rings are made and decorated exactly as are bracket rings except for the welding , which is impossible when the ring encircles a stone pillar . Instead of scarfing the ends , each end is punched for a rivet hole , then each is bent at right angles for about 1 inch . Then the ring is formed around the pillar and the ends are riveted together . Riveting is done by inserting a red-hot rivet in the holes of the ring , holding an 8-pound sledge against the head of the rivet and upsetting the other end with a 2-pound hammer . The heads of animals , birds , reptiles , and mythical creatures may be formed to decorate the ends of rods and bars which serve as supports and braces of baskets , brackets , sconces , chandeliers , and other decorative iron pieces . Such iron sculpture is not so difficult to accomplish as may be imagined . Take , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1/2 - inch- square bar . Roughly described , such a head will consist of the neck , formed by the original bar , cranium , long jaws , ears , and perhaps even a forked , waving tongue . First a boss is formed on the neck to serve as a foundation for the cranium . This is most easily done by doubling the bar 3/4 inch from the end and welding it to the original neck . The snout is shaped by drawing down the boss from about % inch from the doubled-back end , using a set hammer or the corner of the anvil to draw out this portion of the boss to a rectangular section % - inch thick and the same width as the original bar . At this stage the head and snout are molded with careful blows from a light hammer . Next the snout is split crosswise with a thin chisel to form the mouth , which is opened to a 30-degree angle , the bottom jaw being bent downward to form the angle . Teeth may be indicated by marking the upper and lower jaws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smith wishes to take the trouble , he may make a small thin chisel or gouge with which to cut projections to form more natural-looking teeth in the unnatural dragon . Eyes and  | Figure nostrils are generally indicated with a small punch , which , for the eyes , may be forged into an oval shape . Tongues may be welded or shrunk into the open mouth , a delicate , but not impossible , task because of the thin iron involved . When a wickedly curved tongue , perhaps forked , is desired , the mouth must be split longer for shrinking or welding . To shrink , the cold tongue , with a barb on its end , is jambed into the hot mouth as far as possible , this being most easily done while the head is held in the vise . It is then lowered and the vise tightened in order to clamp the tongue in place . To weld , the head is thrust into the fire and the bellows are pumped slowly , so as not to bring it to welding heat too quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin tongue . While the dragon 's head is being heated the  | smith must watch it with great care to make certain that welding heat is only at the base of the jaw and farther back , not extending to the nose and the tip of the tongue . Once welding heat is reached , the last ' / inch of the jaws is welded shut around the base of the tongue . This is more easily done by resting the head upside down on , the anvil and hammering only the base of the jaw . To avoid excess hammering , the split jaw may be joined by placing the end of a ' A-inch-thick bar at the base of the split and smiting it with a 1%-pound hammer . When the welding is done , the portion of the jaws not welded may be opened and the position of the tongue , as well as any curves desired , may be adjusted with needle-nosed pliers while the iron is at an orange heat . Ears may be formed by welding a thin strip or rod to the sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier , and perhaps more effective method , however , is to cut the ears with a thin chisel , the same way teeth were cut . The head should be brought to a yellow heat and the neck part of the iron clamped in the vise so that the hot head extends out of the vise . A quite thin chisel is then driven at an angle toward the mouth , cutting a pointed sliver which is bent upward . The cutting should be carefully planned and done quickly so that possibly both ears can be formed in the same heat . Wings , horns , and other appendages may be welded on by following the same general techniques used in welding tongues and ears . The heads of eagles , dogs , horses , and other creatures are shaped basically in the same manner as a dragon 's head . During the 1960s , in the Inverness region of Scotland , there lived an unknown smith who turned out exquisite decorative firepokers and other small household items , some decorated with animal heads . One poker , made so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rolling mill , except for the ram 's head which formed its finial , demonstrates a most interesting technique which requires no welding . Unlike the dragon 's head described above , this particular ram 's head is made with the end of the bar forming the back of the head . First the bar is tapered for 1/2 inch and shaped to a point . This point is split down its center for the length of the taper , to provide stock for the horns . Each horn is split for Y4 inch at its base on the outside to form an ear on each side . The horns are then heated to an orange-red and twisted to simulate the twists of a real ram 's horns . Below the horn and ears , the cranium and face of the ram is molded with careful hammering and with a small fuller , and the snout is drawn out to half the width of the forehead . Eyes are indicated with a small punch , and nostrils are stamped about 34 inch from the base of the horns . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rod back under the head at a point under the nostrils , bending being done with a fork in the hardie hole . At the base of the horns , the rod is doubled back once more and curved downward into  | the shank of the poker . Finishing touches are given by indicating the line of the mouth with a thin chisel , adjusting the ears and curving the twisted horns downward into a spiral with small pliers . The shank of the poker may be decorated with chisel and punch marks . A human head and face for a finial is more easily molded from iron than the uninitiated may think . First the end of a bar or rod is either doubled back and welded together or is upset to provide a ball the shape of a human head . This basic form is smoothed with a light hammer at a cherry-red heat until all contours are rounded . The basic features are formed with a small fuller . Midway between the top of the head and the chin , a groove is fullered across the face to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chin , another groove is fullered which forms the bottom of the nose and the upper lip . Next the nose is formed by fullering two grooves from the middle of the brow at about a 25-degree angle halfway between the nose and the chin . This forms the nose and cheeks . A mouth is made with a small , thin chisel between the two diagonal dents ; eyes are made with a punch . Ears may be welded on , but this is most difficult , and i t is much easier to mark the ears with a chisel . Just a few ' marks with small fuller , chisel , and punch will clearly simulate a human likeness . A discriminating smith , however , will wish to go further than this . He will either carve with a cold hisel , which makes him a true sculptor , or he will make special small swages and fullers to stamp natural contours into the hot iron . Perhaps the most difficult sculptured creations of the smith are represented by the large wrought-iron eagles , grifIoons , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold candlesticks and brackets in their outstretched claws . These were almost certainly made in several pieces which were welded together , and the making  | of any one would require a large forge , cranes to move the heavy iron pieces from forge to anvil , and the combined efforts of several men . Apparently some of these creatures were forged from bars and others from sheet iron . Details were probably roughed in forging and refined with chisels . Making such an elaborate sconce from a solid bar is a matter of carefully sculpturing the features of the piece with  | special hammers , fullers , punches , and chisels . It may be assumed that initially the head , body , and tail will be forged . Wings and legs are forged separately and welded to the body , much in the manner that eighteenth-century iron anchors were formed and assembled by welding in the large industrial smithies of France . Diderot 's Encyclopedia provides some excellent illustrations of forging huge anchors . In the case of eagles and griffons and dragons forged from solid stock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The tradition of handicraft dictated that each smith 's design be somewhat different from any other . How a smith renders his design will depend largely on his shop , his tools , his experience , and the number and skill of his helpers . Welding several heavy pieces together will be somewhat easier than may be imagined . Heavy iron holds welding heat a relatively long time , allowing relative leisure in fitting and forming the pieces , once welding heat has been achieved . Suffice it to say that quick , good judgment , artistic imagination , and familiarity with the basic tools and techniques , heretofore described , will make the seemingly arduous and impossible task easier than may be anticipated . There were other much simpler , but no less graceful and less beautiful , lighting appliances made in many a local smith in America , England , and Europe during the seventeenth , the eighteenth , and the early nineteenth centuries . These included wrought-iron hanging chandeliers , small wall sconces , often formed in the shape of lilies or roses , and table chandeliers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graceful hanging chandeliers is an eighteenth-century design made of ' 4 - inch iron rod , with four , six , or eight arms . For a four-armed chandelier , the material required is a 1/4 - inch rod , 18-inches long , and three rods of the same diameter , but only 9-inches long . The long rod is heated to an orange-red on one end and a ring of 3/4 - inch in- p 300 Figure side diameter is formed around a rod inserted in the hardie hole of the anvil . Next the opposite end is upset to % inch , this being done at a white heat using a 1 i/2 - pound hammer for upsetting , while the rod is held across the face of the anvil , or by dropping rapidly , hot end down , on an upsetting plate at the base of the anvil block . Each short rod is upset in the same manner , or since these rods are short , upsetting may be done by placing the white-hot end on the anvil face and tapping the cold end with a hammer . Candle sockets are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rods . Sockets are made of triangles , 2 inches through the axis of the point and 2 ' /4 inches across the base . Edges leading to the point are scarfed , the sockets are formed into small cones on an anvil hick , and the edges are welded , leaving the point open to slip over the rod and rest against the upset end of the rod , where they are hammered tightly . Rod and socket are then placed into the fire and brought to welding heat , the joint being made with a light hammer while the rod is rotated back and forth across the face of the anvil .  | It is a good idea on a hanging chandelier to supplement each candle socket with a circular drip pan to catch excess wax . Drip pans are made by cutting a 2-inch circle from ' A6-inch-thick sheet iron . When cut out , the pan is heated to orange-red , placed with its center over the pritchel hole of the anvil , and punched with a sharp tapered punch . A light hammer must be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The punch should be driven in until the resulting hole is about 576 inch . Using a pointed punch for this operation offsets the edge of the hole where the punch protrudes and provides a wider and steadier base for welding to the base of the socket . When punched , the drip pan is returned to the fire and brought to white heat . The socket is placed on the anvil bick , and the pan is slid up the rod , offset portion away from the socket , and jambed tightly around the base of the socket . This operation can be facilitated by holding a pair of tongs loosely around the rod below the pan and tapping the jaws of the tongs with a light hammer while they are rotated .  | Socket , pan , and rod are brought to welding heat once again . When ready for joining , the assembly is taken from the fire , the socket is placed on the anvil hick , and the weld is made with a small handled-fuller which is used as a hammer , joining the offset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welded , the assembly may be removed from the anvil hick and the pan held , top surface downward , over the edge of the anvil face and dressed flat with a small hammer or the flatter . After completing socket and drip-pan assembly on each arm , all four arms are welded together . The ends of the short rods opposite the candle sockets are scarfed and tapered . Some careful smiths will round the inside surface of the scarf by placing the rod on a round bottom swage and forming a concave channel on the inside surface with a small fuller . After this preparation , the three short rods are placed in position around the long rod at a point where all four candle sockets are on the same plane . The scarfed ends are wired tightly to the long rod and the assembly is put into the fire and brought to welding heat . Joining is done with a medium-weight hammer . The joint is dressed in the same heat by hammering with a light hammer as the joint is rotated back and forth on the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by curving the four arms gracefully , so that the candle sockets point upward . Curving may be done over the horn of the anvil if the smith has a good eye . They may also be curved with a scroll wrench while the arm is held in a scroll fork inserted in the hardie hole . All curves should be checked with a wooden or thin sheet-metal pattern to insure that each arm is identical . Perhaps the best way to curve all four arms alike is to use a hoop of the right size , if available , as a form around which the arms are curved while at an orange heat . Lacking a hoop , the smith can make his own form from a strap 1/4 - inch thick  | Figure and 1-inch wide . This is shaped over the horn to the desired curvature . To use it , the smith places it and the chandelier in the vise , the two positioned so that one arm will have the same axis as that of the strap-iron form . The chandelier arm is then bent around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is repeated until all arms are bent . Other types of table chandeliers and wall candle sconces found in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century homes are often decorated with combinations of leaves and flowers . To make these exquisite creations , the smith must be equipped with a number of special tools , and he must be familiar with techniques far more delicate than those used by the general smith . Making an iron rose is sculpture at its best , demanding inf i nite patience and instinctive knowledge of iron . The tools of the decorative ironworker include " doublefaced hammers , " sometimes referred to as leaf hammers , of a a riety of sizes and forms . The most commonly used has a flat , square face on one end and a curved face on the other . " Round-faced hammers " are also needed to shape certain forms in true decorative ironwork . In addition to hammers , the decorative smith requires " scroll wrenches " of various  | Figure sizes and " scroll forks , " which fit into the hardie hole . There are " offset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of anvil tools besides the scroll forks : devices such as a " wedgeshaped stake iron , " " leaf tools , " cup tools " in several shapes , " scroll starters , " and the " halfpenny snub-nosed scroll . " In addition there is a " combination stake tool , " sometimes used in the vise as well as the anvil , which consists of a 1-inch rod some 6-or 7-inches long which is welded to the side of a shaper , a serpentine wedge with a sharp edge , both rod and shaper being perpendicular to the stake , which fits in the hardie hole or vise . Many smiths who work on decorative items also have a " snarling iron , " a special type of stake anvil with a large semisphere formed on one arm and a straight ,  | narrow , chisel-edged anvil on another arm , both attached to a pointed stake of iron that is driven into a large log . To dish leaves and flower petals he must have large blocks of lead and lead-filled cups . For some work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rope swage " or a " curved-dish swage . " Figure  | There are also special chisels curved to various forms on the edges , and tools such as the " veiner , " which is used to form the veins of leaves . There is also a special fuller called a " cheese fuller . " To achieve additional effects he often creates his own special tools . With such tools , all of which he can make himself , the smith may confidently turn out beautiful artistic creations , limited only by his experience and imagination . A simple , relatively easy-to-make decorative item is a semicircular seventeenth-century Italian table chandelier , which consists of a welded frame made of 1/4-inch rods , with four legs and four candle sockets . It is decorated with simple rose leaves made from 1/4-inch rod and lap-welded to the frame . The frame consists of three parallel 1/4 - inch rods , Iwo of them 12-inches long , and the upper 16-inches long . Figure  | The upper rod is bent at a right angle 2 inches from each end , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as standards . The two short rods are cross-welded to the bent portions so that they are parallel to the upper rod and spaced 3/4 inch apart . This framework forms the skeleton of the chandelier . Four candle sockets are made exactly as for a hanging chandelier , but two of them are on 2-inch rods 1/4 inch in diameter , the other two are on 21/2-inch rods . It is easier to make them on both ends of 4- and 5-inch rods which are cut apart in the middle on the hardie after the sockets are welded . These are then cross-welded to the frame , the shorter ones adjacent to the end of the frame so that the socket is ? inch higher than the upper rod ; the longer ones 4 inches from each end of the frame , with 1/2 inch protruding from the bottom of the frame to serve as additional standards . Decoration for this chandelier consists of eighteen leaves that are welded to the frarne , six between each pair of standards . Leaves are made from 2-inch sections of 1i4 - inch rod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of a long rod and cut off the rod as they are finished . Forming is done by flattening the rod up to 1/2 inch from the end and shaping it to resemble a rose leaf . Veins are simulated with a chisel or a very small fuller . After forming the leaves the short stem is scarfed on the end preparatory to welding to the frame . Leaves are wired to the frame with the stems parallel to the frame rods . Three leaves , one on each rod of the frame , may be brought to welding heat simultaneously . This process is repeated until two leaves are welded to each rod of the frame between each pair of standards , eighteen leaves in all . The chandelier is finished by bending the leaves and stems into interesting angles that disguise the straight lines of frame and standards , and by curving the frame into a semicircle . The final touch is to bend the flattened ends of the standards to a right angle to serve as feet .  | Figure Making a table chandelier decorated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating a wall sconce to hold three candles and decorated with roses or lilies and the leaves appropriate to these delicate blossoms . First of all , the basic chandelier is constructed following techniques used in making a hanging chandelier . Three rods of V4-inch diameter serve as arms for candle sockets and drip pans . These are then fastened to an oval plate of 1/s - inch sheet iron with a ring that is welded to the three rods and bradded to the plate . R ing and rods are assembled and welded in the same manner as a hinge pin , with a tang left on the ring . This is inserted in a hole in the middle of the plate and bradded . Roses or lilies are made separately and either bradded separately in artistic positions on the plate , or fastened within the same ring is the candle arms .  | Both roses and lilies are made of several parts which are later welded together . The blossoms of both are shaped by a similar technique , but the leaves of each flower , being quite dissimilar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves alone , but no blossom , may be made from 1/4 - inch rods . For a stem with five leaves , a rod 12-inches long is scarfed in two places : one 21/2 and one 5 1/2 inches from the end of the rod . Between these flattened spots the rod is slightly drawn out with a light hammer . Two rods 5-inches long are then scarfed in the middle and cross-welded to the long rod to form a sort of cross of Lorraine . Leaves are formed by drawing out the ends of the rods , except for the long portion of the main stem , to a %6-inch thickness about % - inch wide . These thin plates are then cut to the shape of rose leaves with shears or chisel . Veins are indicated with a very small fuller . The characteristic waviness of rose leaves is accomplished by hammering the edges of the leaves while cold with a round-faced hammer on a lead block .  | Figure Rose blossoms are also made from % - inch rod , but require a very delicate touch and a careful eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of care after most of the work has been done . The rod is drawn out slightly along its length for about 4 inches starting at a point 3 inches from the end . The rod at the point above the drawn portion is brought to a white heat , then 1/2 inch of the end is quenched in the slack tub , the rod is placed in a hinged boltheader held in the vise , and the white-hot portion is upset until it cools to a cherry red . It is then removed and reheated to white heat . This is repeated until the upset is 2 inches in diameter and about % - inch thick . At this point the upset portion is again heated to white ,  | and the upset is split laterally into three layers , the split reaching all around to within % inch from the core of the head . Splitting requires the use of a helper to hammer a hot set while the head is held on top of a hot hardie . Positioning of the chisels is controlled by carefully marking with center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the head is split into three layers , it is again brought to a white heat , is inverted on the anvil face , and is drawn out until each layer is no more than %6-inch thick and the head is 21/2 to 3 inches in diameter . Petals are now cut out of all three layers at the same time , using a chisel while the head is orange-red . There are four petals surrounding the stem . To shape the petals the smith heats the head to orange and lifts up one petal of the top layer to about an 80-degree angle . This is dished by shaping it over the cup tool with a ball pein . If a cup tool is not available , petals may be heated to a sunrise red and dished over a cylinder filled with lead , the smith being careful not to hold the hot metal on the lead long enough to melt the lead . When the top layer of petals has been formed , they are bent almost to a 90-degree angle from the plane of the head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the process of dishing is repeated . The same process is followed on shaping the lowest layer of petals . After shaping petals , the whole blossom is brought to a yellow heat , and each layer is twisted an eighth of a turn , so that each layer of petals will cover the division of petals in the layer above or below . The rose is assembled by lap-welding the end of the leaf stem to the blossom stem and bradding the assembly to the oval plate in such a way that the ring holding the candle arms will be hidden . Lilies are easier to make than roses . They are started exactly the same way as roses , by upsetting the end of a 1/4 - inch rod . The head thus formed , however , is not split , but is drawn  | out to about a ' A 6-inch thickness , with the metal around the edges being paper-thin . Also , for the lily blossom the initial upset is swaged or hammered into a semi-egg-shape at the base of the head , to resemble more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for forming the calyx . After flattening the head sufficiently the pattern of the petals is scribed on the iron and the petal shapes are cut out with shears . A simple trick makes this task much easier . At the bottom of the division between each of the four petals , the smith drills a 1% - inch to % - inch hole . This allows him to avoid cutting a sharp angle with his shears at the base of each pair of petals . After cutting out the petals he drills a 1/8 - inch hole in the center of the blossom to a depth of 1/4 inch and threads this with a tap . Next the petals are heated one by one , bent upward into a natural position , and dished on an anvil bick and cupping tool until they are natural looking . Stamens are made of five small nails . The head of each nail is forged into a spherical button and the five are welded together at the point , which is Figure  | then drawn out to , 16 inch , threaded with a die , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiths prefer to shrink the blossom around the stamens , but screwing is a little more secure . Lily leaves are quite easily made , being no more than a % - inch rod , 6-inches long , which is drawn out to form the leaves . Final shape may be cut from this thinned portion with shears . Most lily leaves have roughly parallel veins running from base to tip . These may be made with a small fuller , but there is an easier method , which probably harks back to the late eighteenth century . When several lily leaves are to be made , the smith- may save himself much arduous labor by making a leaf die . This is made in a block , or even a strap of iron a couple of inches wide and at least 1 - inch thick . The shape of a leaf is marked in the iron with a center punch and the iron is brought to orange-red heat in the forge . While hot , the smith fullers in the veins within the leaf shape , using a small 1/16-inch fuller . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and leaves , heated to orange-red , are laid upon it and hammered to fill the fullered veins . Such a die saves many hours of work if a number of leaves are to be produced . Leaves are finished by Figure  | hammering cold with a round-faced wooden mallet over a lead block to furnish a wavy edge to the leaves . Leaves are then welded to the base of the lily stem , and all components are curved and positioned to a natural shape . The smith may be tempted to curve and shape his metal in the finished lily without heating , but he takes a great chance of breaking stem or petal or leaf , especially if his material is mild steel . It is far safer to heat on top of the fire until a cherry red before final shaping . German smiths for several generations have made quite interesting wrought-iron doorbell mechanisms based on a human figure , often a knight in armor , which , when a chain is pulled , rings a small bell . Such a creation is mounted on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the front door . Usually the bell is mounted on a movable bar with an elbow that pivots in an overhead bar . The overhead liar protrudes perpendicularly from the frame and is often finished with a snarling dragon 's head . Beneath stands the knight . His body is a fork which extends downward to form legs and feet and has a crossbar welded to it near the neck to act as shoulder 's . His head is shrunk or screwed to the tang of the fork . Over this iron skeleton is placed a hauberk of sheet metal , no more than a thin sheet cut as the dress of a paper doll to fold over the shoulders and around the body , covering the crotch and legs almost to the knees . The head is covered with a helm . The hauberk is bradded in one or two places on each side beneath the arms . One arm is straight and bradded tightly onto one end of the crossbar which serves as shoulders ; the other is pivoted on the other end of the crossbar and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is curved ; to clamp tightly around the chain . The chain , of course , is attached to the end of the pivoted elbow bar on which the bell is mounted and falls downward through the hand of the knight 's pivoted arm .
