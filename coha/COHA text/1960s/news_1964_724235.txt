txt An army of 5,000 Democratic precinct workers last night noisily approved everything about their party including its 1964 state platform , which draws battle lines on open occupancy legislation and a plan to give Cook county control of the Illinois Senate . Mayor Daley , hailed as " the leader , " led in a succession of demonstrations at the state convention . The demonstrations all but shook the stout walls of the Medinah temple at Wabash avenue and Ohio street . Whenever Daley stood and applauded , several competing bands and thousands of paper horns and cow bells contributed to the din . This happened often . The peak was 20 minutes  --  for Gov . Otto Kerner , whose reelection chances are up for grabs . Buttons for Sale Racks of souvenir buttons were for sale . A popular seller read : " Bury Goldwater in ' 64 .

" " When we carry out the Supreme court dictate of ' one man , one vote ' , we will have a much better chance of a Democratic state Senate as well , " Kerner said . Republicans at their wind-up state convention session Sept. 25 in the Sherman House are expected to adopt a platform opposing both the open occupancy legislation and Senate reapportionment . The reapportionment would give Cook county control of the upper chamber Cook county now controls the House . Kerner Rips Percy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. Percy , " talks out of both sides of his mouth " to tear down what Democrats have built . But the public waits in vain for Percy to say anthing constructive , Kerner asserted . Some days Percy is for Sen. Barry Goldwater , his Presidential nominee , but on other days he is not , the governor charged .
