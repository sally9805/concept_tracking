Dragon Sky . Lady Luck , like most females , needs to feel needed . When Marcel Camus , a middle-aged Frenchman whose first movie had flopped , laid his last sou and two years of his life on the line for a far-out film about the slums of Rio de Janeiro , the lady smiled on every scene he shot-Black Orpheus is a cinemusical masterpiece . But when he lazily decided to remake the same movie in the slums and ruins of Cambodia , the lady gave him a sharp slap in the face-Dragon Sky is just an interesting failure . <P> At first it 's hard to see why . The story , in which two star-crossed lovers relive an old Cambodian legend , is almost the same as the story of Orpheus . The lovers themselves ( Sam El and Narie Hem ) are even more beautiful than the lovers in the earlier film-they look like oriental deities sculptured in living flesh . The color is rich and sensuous , and the camera catches dim disturbing glimpses of Angkor Wat , the great stone temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monstrous unimaginable spider . <P> Nevertheless , as the story unfolds the beauty becomes a bit boring , the sense of dj vu insists , the characters swell into symbols , the symbols dissolve into words and the words fall on the ear with a soft , fruity thud . " I have waited so long . " " I have searched so long . " " One can not choose in life , my son . " <P> One can choose to see only the first half of this film .
