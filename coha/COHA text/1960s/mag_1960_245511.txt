President Charles de Gaulle 's talk of an " Algerian republic " angered Algeria 's European extremists , distressed many Frenchmen and left the Moslem rebels unimpressed . But it made one major convert : Habib Bourguiba , 57 , President of Tunisia , who in a fit of exasperation last October welcomed Communist aid to the F.L.N. rebels . Last week Bourguiba was hailing De Gaulle 's proposal as a " big step forward " and using his impressive behind-the-scenes talents to persuade the <P> F.L.N. to give De Gaulle a final chance . <P> Bourguiba is busily rounding up support among the new African states to the south ( pointedly omitting left-leaning Ghana and Guinea ) to go easy on France in this week 's Algerian debate at the U.N . Bourguiba 's argument : if De Gaulle gets his expected large majority in the Jan. 8 referendum and deals firmly with the threat of violence from the European extremists in Algeria , the way will then be open for Bourguiba and his allies to act as neutral observers in Algeria 's eventual vote on self-determination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it will be a fair referendum . Then the F.L.N. could achieve power by peaceful political process . Explained a Tunisian official : " If De Gaulle 's latest behavior reflects a sincere desire to decolonize Algeria-and we think it does-there will soon be no point in the F.L.N. 's carrying on a shooting war or receiving massive military aid from the Communists . " <P> Hot Opposition . It was now up to De Gaulle himself to put his prestige on the line again . This week he will go to Algeria to explain his policies to the French army and the hostile European colons , who are already talking of demonstrations . <P> Maybe some European colons might mull over the news from Morocco next door . After dodging French naval patrols , the Communist freighter Bulgaria docked at the Moroccan harbor of Tangier , unloaded 3,400 tons of arms , including 14,000 rifles and automatic weapons , which were promptly shipped to the town of Oudjda near the Algerian border . Though the Moroccans last week insisted that the arms were for their own use , French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China . If so , it is the first tangible result of the recent visit of F.L.N. Chief Ferhat Abbas to Peking .
