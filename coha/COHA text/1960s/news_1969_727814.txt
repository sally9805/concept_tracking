txt Britain , West Germany , and the Netherlands are planning to set up an industry that could put a nuclear squeeze on France and the United States . Now Italy wants to join them . The industry would be based on a device called the gas centrifuge . If successful , it would enrich natural uranium with fissionable material in a new and cheaper way . That would mean independence for Western Europe from America 's near-monopoly in high-grade fuel for atomic power plants . It would mean further loss for France on a costly investment in ? the " old fashioned " way of making such fuel . And for the United States , it would raise the specter of the " cheap " atomic bomb . The centrifuge , at least in theory , might enable relatively poor but industrially advanced countries to develop nuclear weapons more easily . It would also mean failure of nearly three decades of American efforts to suppress the centrifuge process . American laboratories are forbidden to work on it except under special Atomic Energy Commission contract . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it banned public mention of it by officials a few years ago . But while West Germany and the Netherlands agreed with the United States to keep the technology secret , they have pushed its development . So too , have Japan and Communist China . Project roughed in Last November , the British , West Germans , and Dutch announced a joint effort to continue the research . Observers at the time did not think this would lead to much . But in March , the three partners met in London to lay rudimentary plans for two centrifuge-enrichment plants . One is to be built in Holland , one in Britain . Now Italy 's Foreign Minister , Pietro Nenni , is eying the consortium . At the end of a state visit here in late // ' European trio pushes cheaper A-fuel plan // April he referred to his country 's hope of joining the project . He was commenting on talks about technical cooperation he had had with British Foreign Secretary Michael Stewart : Clearly , Europeans are more concerned with plentiful atomic fuel than with theoretical fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many of the more advanced plants use enriched uranium . Natural uranium consists mostly of atoms that weigh 238 times as much as hydrogen . These do not fission spontaneously . But the natural metal also has a tiny fraction of a lighter atom which does fission  --  uranium 235 . Weights differ Chemically the two kinds of atoms are identical . But because they have slightly different weights they can be separated . For example , in gaseous form , the two kinds of atoms pass through tiny pores in a membrane at slightly different rates . This is the basis of the gas diffusion process that makes enriched uranium today . Passing the uranium through miles of membrane-filled pipes will increase the proportion of uranium 235 up to the point where it is pure enough for bombs . That is well beyond the small-percentage enrichment needed for power plants . Building diffusion plants takes a lot of capital and engineering skill . The three United States plants reportedly cost almost $2.5 billion . And they consume tens of megawatts of electric power . The enormous building costs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the main factors that have kept most countries from setting up enrichment plants of their own . So far , only Britain , France , Communist China , the Soviet Union , and the United States have done so . But the centrifugal force of a spinning centrifuge also can separate the two kinds of uranium atoms . And it can , in theory , do it less expensively . The American Manhattan Project looked into this in the early 1940 's . At that time , the technical problems appeared overwhelming . There were no materials that could stand the stress of rotating at the speeds needed for practical enrichment . As the atomic age unfolded , American planners based their strategy for keeping bombs out of other hands partly on discouraging other countries from getting into the enrichment business . This meant be coming a world supplier of enriched atomic fuel , sold with rigid safeguards to prevent weapons development . It also meant trying to suppress the potentially cheaper centrifuge process . While Britain can enrich uranium , massive American production now dominates the European market . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a cost of more than a billion dollars . It is reported to be ineffi cient . Technical problems have kept it from making any impact , in Europe yet . Nevertheless , France has long disrupted efforts of the six-nation Euratom group to set up joint enrichment facilities of its own . Now Britain , West Germany , and Holland are moving to sidestep the French and undercut American dominance . Details of their centrifuge process are secret . But their experts seem to have solved the technical problems . Materials that can withstand the stresses may make use of the carbon fibers developed by Britain ' ? Royal Aircraft Establishment . Light and stronger than steel , they could reinforce other materials substantially . As for the threat of cheap bombs , experts note that the certrifuge process saves money largely because it requires relatively little power . The plants still take highly advanced engineering and considerable capital to build . Nations wanting bombs probably could get them even more cheaply by making plutonium in atomic reactors using natural uranium fuel . After all , one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
