txt 14 Machines need New Markets NAPOLEON had been defeated . No longer did French customs officials guard the North Sea coast , ready to arrest any merchant who dared to import coffee or sugar . With their pencils poised over their order-books British merchants once more visited their old customers on the Continent , in Antwerp , Amsterdam , Frankfurt , Cologne , and Hamburg . For seven years they had been cut off from them . Now they were able to sit together again , exchanging reminiscences , telling stories about life under the blockade , and about adventurous and dangerous smuggling exploits . Many a worthy merchant on the Continent had been inside a French prison . Every one had been tricking the detested Corsican in some way or another , buying or hiding contraband , making prohibited payments , or harbouring smugglers . Now it was all over and commerce could at last emerge again . It was positively bound to boom , if only because of the prices which had until quite recently been paid for prohibited sugar , coffee , tea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap again . Business surely would soar to unprecedented heights . That , at any rate , was what the British thought . It was also what the great merchants in the continental ports expected , in spite of their deep-rooted caution . Order-books were filling up rapidly ; the whole world expected an unparalleled boom . But instead there came a painful setback . Europe was impoverished . Only now did it become plain how much she had suffered during the difficult war years . Britain was passing through a grave economic crisis : the interminable wars had left her 300 // with a debt of millions of pounds sterling . The Continental System and the war at sea had inflicted terrible losses upon the merchanthouses and the shipowners , losses which could not be offset by Britain 's overseas trade , by her business with America and Asia . But these losses were as nothing compared with the devastation suffered by the Continent , where armies had marched from Spain to Moscow , fighting battles , trampling down crops , looting cities , and paralysing all trade . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , behind those enforced customs barriers , who had not dreamed of drinking once again some genuine coffee instead of the chicory infusion which served as a substitute ; who had not longed for a pipe of real Virginia tobacco instead of the pungent ( and by no means cheap ) weed on sale during the war ? And did not the sugar made from sugar-cane taste sweeter than the stuff now extracted from beet juice ? The English cotton cloth came as something of a revelation to the women on the Continent : such colour and beauty , and above all such low prices ! Compared with the English cottons the coarse stuff worn during the terrible years of blockade seemed dull and drab , besides being shockingly expensive . But how was continental Europe to pay for all these splendours ? During the long years of the Continental System new conditions had come into being : domestic manufacture had been extended , reorientated , and adapted . Britain had lost not only her market for colonial merchandise but also her suppliers of foodstuffs and timber . Producers everywhere were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1815 the English landed gentry achieved a total ban on imports of wheat so long as the price was below eighty shillings per quarter . How were they to pay off their crushing mortgages if the grain price were to drop to nothing under the impact of continental competitors ? No matter how much the population of the rapidly growing cities , such as Manchester and Birmingham , lamented about the " hunger bill , " the Conservative majority in the Commons remained adamant . The result was impressive : the price of wheat rose to 120 shillings per quarter . Within fifteen months many farming estates were able to quintuple their receipts . But the trade with the Continent was killed dead . Because Britain prohibited the import of wheat the price soon // dropped on the Continent . In France it declined from 36 francs per hectolitre in 1816 to 24.60 francs , and before long to 18.42 francs . France now similarly cut herself off from outside , and in turn passed on the agricultural depression to the East . Germany did not know where to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchandise that was wanted so badly . The Hamburg merchants , meanwhile , were stuck with the supplies they had bought in the first fine flush of rejoicing . They could not hold out for long , since the capital of even the wealthiest firms had been greatly reduced by the colossal war levies imposed on them as recently as 1813 . But all that might have been bearable if only business got under way again . As the prices of agricultural produce suddenly collapsed the purchasing power in town and country dwindled away . The manufacturers of industrial goods were now likewise clamouring for protection , ' for customs duties and import prohibitions . The French prohibited the import of all iron and steel from Britain , of silk from Italy and India , and of woollen blankets and shawls . They greatly increased import duties on cotton and woollen goods . At the same time , the French manufacturers demanded from their Government large-scale export aid ; the country was being choked by its own over-production . Everybody ? Germans , Swedes , Dutch , Spaniards , Russians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind colossal customs barriers . As if disaster could be averted that way ! No one had learned his lesson and no one was prepared to learn . Governments clung to the fetish of the home market as though it were a cake from which slice after slice could be cut off for the domestic producers . However , this home market proved to be a mirage : it shrank and faded away . One by one , the merchant-houses had to suspend payments ; one by one , the factories had to close . Workmen were hanging about the streets , unemployed , while their wives and children were starving at home . There was no shortage of men willing to work , nor of raw materials , nor yet of manufacturing enterprises . All that was lacking was a market . The producers dominated the field . But the measures they proposed merely made things worse . " Buy as little as possible from others and sell them as much as possible " was the slogan coined by the French Minister of Commerce Saint-Cricq . First ruin your customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of a single year ( 1826 ) some 7000 French merchant firms crashed . The French Revolution had brought freedom : political freedom by the overthrow of the monarchy and the foundation of the Republic ; legal freedom by the liberation of the peasants . To that was added economic freedom : all trades had been declared free , and every person was entitled to engage in whichever vocation he chose regardless of guilds or trade associations . No longer did a peasant have to toil hard for his feudal lord ; no longer did the peasant women and girls have to spend the long winter evenings spinning at the manor . If they did so they had to be remunerated , and , what was more , in ready money ? money which they could spend on whatever they chose . That was something previously unknown in the countryside . Peasants and their womenfolk had always worked for themselves and for their master . In return they had received their daily bread , their clothes , their footwear , their farming implements , their cottage and their beds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter . Cash was almost unknown to them . In sixteenth-century England a ploughman ? the most valuable man in the field ? received fifty shillings a year . That did not leave much for purchases . But then , most of what he required he received on the estate . Now he was being remunerated in cash , just as the maids and the spinning women . At last he would be able to afford all manner of things . But all these hopes were bitterly disappointed : there was no work for him because the squire did not have enough ready money . Itinerant merchants and pedlars would offer the most dazzling merchandise : colourful printed cotton cloth , known as nankeen , sugar , coffee , and tobacco ? but only few people would reach for their purses . True , prices were temptingly low ? but there just was no money about . Under the old feudal organization of the big estates no one had asked for money . A man would wait until a job was finished , the harvest gathered in , a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up beer and bread , harvest festivals would be celebrated , and every man or woman rewarded according to his work ? with the fruits , in part , of his own labour . Now the small farmers were complaining that their landlords had ceased to look after them and abandoned them to their fate , no matter whether they went hungry or lay sick . The landowners , for their part , complained just as bitterly : farm hands would no longer work , they had become lazy and // rebellious , and grumbled about their low wages . Yet they were charging the most fantastic prices for any service performed for the landowner ! Small wonder . When a man took his horse to be shod he now had to pay cash to the blacksmith ; when a shoemaker sold a pair of boots he demanded good money . If a man 's worn-out clothes needed replacing a veritable small fortune was needed . There was nothing to be had free ; nothing was given away as a present . Were conditions any different in the towns ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprenticed to a craftsman or a merchant . There he would be safe for five years . He would get his bed and board , he would be clothed , and if he should fall ill his employer 's family or servants would look after him . He was thus relieved of all anxiety . On the other hand , he could buy next to nothing during those years ? for he was given no cash . If his employer 's wife was stingy , then he would go hungry . To buy additional food , say a loaf of white bread or a stick of candy sugar , was a dream only rarely realized . Discipline was old-fashioned and strict . " Do n't disgrace us , boy ! " his guardian said to young Hudtwalker ? later to become a highly respected Hamburg merchant ? when he took him to be apprenticed to a herring merchant . The apprentice shared the servants ' table with the maids , eating whatever was set before him ? and that , according to his own account , was not much . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herringpackers ; even if he had cut his finger he had to dip his hand into the smarting brine ; in the evening , when the other workmen went to their homes , he had to do office work in the counting-house . He was not allowed to go out without permission . In the morning he cleaned not only his master 's shoes but also those of the firm 's servants . The one thing that got him down , to the point of tears , was having to carry the filthy refuse of the house across the street . His apprenticeship lasted four years . He had very little pocket-money . This very strict discipline , which survived in many places until the middle of the nineteenth century , was described also by Bernhard Reemtsma , the founder of the big German cigarette firm . One night , during his apprenticeship , his hunger had become so unbearable that he sneaked out and walked home to his parents , a distance of several miles , to tell them how miserable he was . Without a single word his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole // distance to hand him over to his apprenticeship master for punishment . He was given no food at home . A merchant can make a sale only if his customer has money , or if he is likely to have money in the near future . Credit can be given only if one is sure that money ? i.e. , cash ? will be available at some future date . A country , similarly , can sell goods to another only if it will also buy from it ? not the other way round , as the over-clever French Minister imagined . But the moment a merchant supplied cheap merchandise the local producers would clamour for protection . In the 1820 's the colonial merchants were still the only ones of any account ? at least in so far as turnover was concerned . Before long , however , drapers ' shops appeared in the major towns , selling no longer artisanmade articles , but factory-produced goods . The artisan , who preferred to sell his own products , looked with disfavour and alarm on the merchant who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made elsewhere ? " factory-made rubbish . " The new-fangled stuff was certainly pleasing to the eye , but would it stand up to a thorough test ? During the age of the rococo most manufactories had been working for the nobility and the rich burghers ; they alone could afford the heavy brocades , the lace jabots , and the magnificent tapestries . The rest of the townspeople contented themselves with watching the elegant world on the great feast-days ? and the oppressed unfree peasants did not enter into the picture at all . Now the machines were available but the consumers were hanging back . Was it really practical and cheap to buy clothes and articles from the merchant ? The artisans were up in arms , proclaiming against the poor quality of factory-made goods ; family men were alarmed at the thought of having to produce more house-keeping money because " everything was so expensive nowadays . " Why was it suddenly necessary to buy so many foreign-made goods ? The authorities chided the extravagance ' of the broad masses who insisted on smoking tobacco , drinking coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their wages no longer adequate . Perhaps all these unnecessary luxuries should be taxed so heavily that people would lose interest in them ? But the good old days were gone . A new wind was blowing across Europe . The merchants were offering the prettiest and most alluring materials at very reasonable prices , thanks to the machines and ? let us not forget it // ? thanks to the abominably low wages paid to the workers . But would it have been possible , without those low prices , to break the oldestablished habit of buying practically nothing and making everything at home ? Commerce meant work , bread , and money not only for the urban worker but also for the farmer who could send his produce to wherever it was well paid . Bismarck 's father was always in a good humour when he could sell wool to England . If only there had been no customs duties ! Anyone travelling from Hamburg to Frankfurt at that time had to Cross 144 customs frontiers , some territorial and some urban . At every one of them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchandise the traveller was carrying with him ? customs duty or road toll , excise duty or consumer tax ? and every time it meant a delay , lengthy argument , and sometimes annoyance . How could trade prosper under these circumstances even within a limited economic area ? In 1816 Prussia abolished all customs duties on the boundaries of her provinces and cities . Only on her national frontiers was duty to be levied in future . Moreover , instead of the forbidding rates which had arisen during the war years , the maximum duty now was to be 10 per cent . ad valorem . There were no restrictions on imports or exports , and all commerce within the Kingdom of Prussia was open to anyone . Merchandise passing through Prussia ? i.e. , to be re-exported ? was not subject to customs duty upon entering the country . The smaller German principalities were likewise compelled to exempt transit goods for fear that trade would otherwise bypass them . But the centrally situated Electorate of Hesse could not be bypassed , and it alone kept up its transit toll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States amalgamated to form an economic union . The German Customs Union had at last become a fact . But who would protect the artisan and the newly arising industries from competition ? Britain was anxious to dump her industrial goods ? cotton cloth , woollen textiles , iron and steel articles , and machinery ? as well as her West Indian tropical produce , such as sugar , rum , tobacco , and coffee , on to the European market . In exchange she would have to accept continental goods ? no matter what her worried domestic producers said . The struggle for free trade ' began . Skilfully the free traders denounced the high corn prices and mobilMachines // ized public opinion against protective tariffs . Certainly , they said , British agriculture must be assured of a fair ' price . But as soon as the price of grain rose above sixty shillings per quarter the tariffs would have to be lowered to allow foreign grain into the country ? until the domestic price had again dropped to the standard level . France was once more allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ export prohibitions on machines and raw wool . The effect of this more liberal commercial policy was surprising : during the ten years from 1820 to 1830 British imports rose from L 30,000,000 to L46,000,000 , and exports from L 38,000,000 to ? 6o,000,000 . If the country wanted large-scale commerce , the free traders were saying , the merchants must be given a free hand . Price , and price alone , must govern foreign trade . In that way the most efficient man would succeed . Anyone maintaining his business thanks only to high protective tariff barriers would fall by the wayside . Initiative and efficiency would bring their reward . Richard Cobden of Manchester , a former merchant in fine cottons , // unfurled the banner of genuine free trade . Manchester was the place where the new wind of free enterprise was felt most clearly ; Manchester manufacturers had the best machines , and the Manchester merchants with their low prices were squeezing the monopoly traders of the old East India Company out of all world markets . It was in Manchester that the enterprising spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manchester became a concept . It stood for freedom , for both peaceful and fierce competition , for industrial progress . In all arguments about trade policy , about the cushioning that should or should not be given to the domestic producer , about the extent to which a nation 's prosperity depended on fixed prices , about methods of labour and production ? the name of Manchester invariably stands for free trade . It embodies the idea of the merchant in opposition to protective tariffs , to a protectionism which all too frequently , if not always , protects the producer at the expense of the consumer . In 1846 Cobden was victorious ; the British corn taxes were abolished , and a few years later free trade encompassed all branches of British foreign trade . At last the idea that a country could not sell anything unless it also imported had gained acceptance . Manchester did not need silver or gold to buy merchandise in the East or West Indies ; it supplied the cheap cotton goods which were in greater demand than any precious metal . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was its own business ? but the public should not be compelled to buy merchandise from manufacturers working with outdated methods and with inadequate machinery , producing articles which did not stand up to fierce competition because they were too expensive . Why should the cultivation of grain and other crops be protected when these could easily be replaced by imports from other parts of the world ? Especially if a worker could earn higher wages in the factories than by toiling in the fields . The French were not convinced . It was all very well for the British to hold those views , but their industry was technically superior to that of France . If France opened her frontiers surely she would be swamped with cheap goods and so ruined . Impossible , replied the free traders . Britain was bound to import as much as she exported ? how else was she to pay for her imports ? It was , of course , possible that one domestic producer might be favoured at the expense of another , the Lyons silkweaver , for instance , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry might even be ruined if it proved unable to stand up to foreign competition ? but on the national scale one country could never benefit at the expense of another . No country could ever export unilaterally without importing at the same time . Who then was to decide what the population in a country should consume ? the Government by its customs barriers or the customer by his reaction to the price ? The fiercest struggle for protective tariff barriers was put up by the French cotton manufacturers . They were joined by the sugar-refiners and the wool manufacturers , and before long support came also from the ironmasters . What use were the Finance Minister 's bitter complaints about monopoly tendencies ? The middle-class entrepreneurs allied themselves with the landed gentry in stubbornly opposing any reduction of tariffs . Against this resistance even the " enlightened " Government of the Bourbons was powerless . At least , the merchant was able to move freely within the frontiers of France ; all internal customs barriers of provinces and towns had been abolished . Not until after the fall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reductions made ? 3 3 per cent . on wool and 25 per cent . on iron . But that was all . Only in the overseas markets could a merchant sell his merchandise without difficulty , for to the European merchant the tropical produce was as good as ready cash . Since the planter could easily sell his own crops he was also prepared to buy European industrial goods . Besides , who was to object to imports there ? What had once been achieved by Liverpool should not be beyond the powers of the Hamburg merchants ? to build up a domestic industry by way of the world market . The Spanish colonies in America ? with the exception of Cuba ? had broken free from their mother country ; they were receiving the German merchants with open arms . Provided they bought their sugar , coffee , and tobacco they would buy their German textiles and German craftsmen 's tools . The Hamburg merchants went out to America , to Africa , and to Asia . The independent republics of America would rather supply their coffee , sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it via England ; they readily accepted German textiles and hardware . From 1823 to 1825 some 40 to 50 ships called at Hamburg each year from North America , and 70 to 8o from the West Indies ; the number of ships from South America soared from 63 to 130. // Trade agreements were concluded with the young republics , prepared and negotiated , as a rule , by merchants from the Hanseatic towns . The bigger German States , like Prussia , were holding back . Two-thirds of all firms which opened settlements overseas were Hanseatic merchant-houses . They had a tough fight on their hands against British and U.S. competition , but they established themselves firmly ? not by any means because German industry was superior to that of the Anglo-Saxon countries , but simply because the German merchants represented a vast continental market for tropical produce . In continental Europe people were only slowly switching from the old and familiar woollen and linen materials , or the linen-cotton mixtures like fustian , to the new-fangled cotton fabrics . Even the lower prices made little difference at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Would it last ? Would it do for her daughter 's " bottom drawer " ? Would a skirt made from it still be good in ten years ' time ? The farmer in Georgia and the Creole in Buenos Aires were less choosy ? so long as the merchandise was cheap , handsome , and colourful . In the New World cotton went well . All one had to do was sail out there and seek customers , and find out at the same time what those foreign countries produced and whether it would pay to import their manufactures to Europe . About the year 1845 there were nearly 400 German business houses overseas ? 137 of them in North America , 98 in South America , 48 in Mexico alone , and 35 in Central America . Without a sea power or a unified country to back them these men were prepared to compete against the all-dominating British trade . World commerce at that time was tantamount to British commerce . England could scarcely be beaten ; she possessed the best machines , a well-balanced banking system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchants knew the whole world . Nowhere could cotton or wool be bought so favourably as in Liverpool or London , nowhere were tariffs so low , nowhere was as much coal mined as in Britain , nowhere was as much iron smelted . What chances had Hamburg got ? Commerce , however , is not a one-way street ; anyone wishing to sell must also buy . Anyone seeking a customer must try to please him . Since England needed the German market she had to cultivate the Germans : she had to lend them capital , make machinery available to them , and buy anything that could be further processed or // re-exported . The more solvent the customer , the more he will buy , and the more business will prosper . Britain did all she could to build up a modern industry on the Continent and to stimulate trade . English merchants were working hand in hand with German merchants ; English banks discounted the bills of the Hamburg merchant-houses , English insurance companies underwrote a considerable part of the risks . London remained the centre of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slave trade was flourishing on the African coast . Indeed , it had increased tremendously . How else was a Negro chieftain to pay for the weapons , the alcohol , the pearls , the fabrics , and even the cast-off generals ' uniforms , unless with " black ivory " ? The southern states of the U.S.A. and Brazil were clamouring for this merchandise . ' In 1806 Britain had prohibited the slave trade and had moreover urged France , Holland , and Denmark to cut off this trade . But this did not have much effect because the Portuguese and U.S. merchants now appropriated the business . True enough , Portugal prohibited the trade in human beings in 1836 and the Brazilian Empire followed suit in 1850 ; the United States of America had issued a bill against the slave trade as early as 1820 . Those laws , however , existed only on paper . There were plenty of greedy , ruthless , and unscrupulous men who cared little about laws , or about British men-of-war , let alone about " the commands of humanity . " On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was established ; he was the son of poor people from Rio de Janeiro with African blood in his veins . He could neither read nor write , but he supplied woollen materials , iron articles , pearls , and , above all , weapons to the Negro king in exchange for slaves . Since superstition prevented the king from ever going near the sea , Souza administered the coastal area as his Resident . ' His house in Widah positively sparkled with silver vessels . There he would receive his European visitors and discuss lawful commerce with British merchants . Offshore , however , on the high seas , the British warships intercepted the sailing-ships which Souza sent to America loaded with wretched negroes . Although thirty-four fully laden ships were thus intercepted in the course of a few years Souza grew richer and richer . It was not particularly surprising : between 1836 and 1840 the slavers still exported more than 100,000 slaves from West Africa each year . // Farther north , in Sierra Leone , lived a Spaniard named Pedro Blanco , a retired sea-captain from Malaga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between moo and 2000 slaves ; moreover , he had a number of trading-stations strung out as far as Digby . His look-outs were posted along the African coast , watching the British blockade ships through telescopes . As soon as they spotted a gap in the line , the slave ships would slip out on a dark night to gain the high seas . Finally the British lost their patience ; they simply burned down all the trading-posts . The cunning Pedro , however , had meanwhile escaped to Havana , in Cuba , where he became a reputable merchant dealing in European industrial articles and in sugar . When he died he left a round million dollars . In Africa Pedro 's shady business was continued by a certain Canot , a Florentine by birth . His slave station was in the land of the Krumen , in what is to-day Liberia . He even founded a colony of his own which he offered to Britain ; he laid out plantations and engaged in legitimate trade ? in short , he tried to give the impression of a reputable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while taking a slave ship to the New World under the American flag . He died in poverty . They were strange and colourful characters , the men who controlled commerce on the African coast , the men with whom the honest merchants from Britain and Hamburg had to work whether they liked it or not , if they wanted to engage in commerce there at all . In 1834 the Hamburg shipowner Georg Heinrich Wappaus sent the brig Brazil Packet to Africa under the command of Captain Hinrichsen . His instructions were to reconnoitre from Gambia where ivory and gold , as well as pepper and rice , might be purchased most favourably . On no account was he to turn into the Niger estuary since " that river was unhealthy " ; instead he was to look out for dye-woods , arrowroot , and ebony . Above all , he was to trade linen for ivory . He was instructed not to sail beyond Angola because , in the opinion of the prudent merchant , " further down it is dangerous and no business to be done . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , arrested him without much ado ; however , he was able to prove his innocence . The German trade with Africa developed surprisingly quickly , and before long surpassed that of France . Yet Britain continued to hold the key position in world trade . It was from Britain that most of the tropical produce was bought  --  sugar , // coffee , cotton , but also British cotton fabrics , iron , machines , and so on . From Britain came the new manufacturing methods , the " industrial age . " By 1812 France already had i i , 000 Jacquard looms , which controlled the threads by means of punched cards and produced magnificent silks in unlimited quantities . Entrepreneurs installed new machines , modernized their undertakings , and employed steam-power to save human labour . Marketing , on the other hand , encountered well-nigh insuperable difficulties . The small shopkeeper was unable to sell the vast quantities which the manufacturers were putting out . At the beginning of the nineteenth century the European public ? almost as in the Middle Ages ? still made its purchases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in front of the town-hall , by the bridge , or during Church fairs , when merchants would come from far afield . Food was brought to the towns by the peasants of the neighbourhood . Anyone wanting to buy anything in between markets had to go to the huckster or small shopkeeper , who would sit in his narrow ill-lit shop , frequently a basement , crammed full of all kinds of merchandise from barrels of salted herring and sugar-cones down to linen and woollen materials . There was hardly room to move in the confined space among the piles of haphazardly stacked goods . But the regular customers were not put out by that : they knew exactly what there was and where it was to be found . As these general stores ' had to keep all kinds of merchandise they were , of course , unable to offer much choice . A customer had to accept what he was offered : paper and writing materials , sewing equipment for the womenfolk , needles and thread , but also spades , chains , scythes , and whips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , besides spirits and all kinds of junk which some itinerant dealer might have talked the shopkeeper into buying ? necklaces , rosaries , an occasional porcelain figure or a fine china cup . Herring continued to be part of the popular diet , at least during the winter and during Lent in the Catholic countries . But it was in demand also with other European nations because it kept well and was easily transported in the barrel . Little wonder that the nickname of " herring-tamer " came to be applied to the small shopkeeper generally on the continent of Europe . Since the collapse of Napoleon 's Continental System colonial merchandise such as coffee , tea , cocoa , tobacco , and sugar were stocked // also by the general store . The days were gone when these pleasures had been confined to a small circle and when a well-meaning authority had severely punished smoking in public , especially in public squares and parks . Only in the Tiergarten Park in Berlin was the ban on smoking kept up until 1848 . Its abolition was one of the achievements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much tobacco , coffee , and sugar as he wished ? or as he could afford . In the small crowded general store there simply was no room for textiles ; besides , the valuable fabrics were too easily soiled among the jumble of mixed merchandise . Until well into the nineteenth century textiles were sold by the wholesale merchants ? both in the bale and as garments , trousers , jackets , dresses , and overcoats for individual customers . As a rule , however , material used to be bought at the tailor 's . Under the pressure of factory-made supplies a significant change was now coming about : the general store began to specialize . Shops would stock either colonial merchandise or home produce , ' or textiles , or iron articles . The victualler 's shops ' were based on the assumption that fewer and fewer housewives would get their food from the patch of land they might own outside the town walls . Only few would now kill a pig to keep the family in ham , bacon , and sausage throughout the winter ; housewives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer stored apples and pears . Indeed , they did not even go to the weekly market regularly any longer but bought whatever they needed in the shop . All domestic produce was stocked by the home-produce merchant . ' There the townsmen and farmers could also try a glass of spirits , a quarter of open local wine , or a tankard of beer . The drapers ' shops stocked colourful printed cottons , especially nankeen , as well as English cotton cloth , occasionally also some genuine Indian material , muslin , or silks from Lyons made now on a Jacquard loom , haberdashery , gloves , and modish bonnets . Here the ladies would always find some novelty ; the commercial travellers going from town to town , trying to sell their wares , saw to that . At the end of the eighteenth century out of the 165,000 people employed in Prussia in trade and industry , 151,000 , or 92 per cent. , worked in the textiles industry , with linen manufacture still accounting for more workmen than the woollen and cotton industries taken together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods began to flood // the German market . The fierce struggle between linen and cotton was on . With the courage of desperation the linen-weavers resisted their more powerful rivals . Surely their customers would not forsake the durable , sound linen materials which were so ideally suited to being handed down from one generation to another and which could be bought years ahead for one 's daughter 's marriage portion without deteriorating by prolonged storage . Hardware merchants often adjusted themselves entirely to the needs of the farmers , stocking ploughshares , hoes , nails and screws , hammers and axes from Sheffield or Solingen . They also kept whips , saddles , harness and carts , barrels and hoops , much to the annoyance of blacksmiths , wainwrights , coopers , and saddlers . The hardest hit by these changes were the pedlars and hucksters , who used to roam over the country without any competition , selling all kinds of junk and knick-knacks , as described by Jost Ammann in his Book of Estates printed in 1568 : " Spices , sugar and brandy , looking-glasses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacles . " In order to display his specialized and more extensive range of goods a merchant needed more spacious premises , preferably on the ground floor . But to meet the high rent he must have a big turnover . He could no longer wait for customers to walk in on their own account . Instead , he would have handbills distributed in the street , advertising the merchandise he happened to have in stock . The artisans were outraged by these new importunate methods of publicity , which ran counter to all custom and indeed to good manners . The freedom to practise any trade , brought by the French Revolution and the reforms of Stein-Hardenberg , was evidently breaking up the traditional principles of business morality . Surely , the artisans told themselves , the quality of a handmade article must speak for itself . But instead , those shopkeepers were advertising their factory-made rubbish by excessive claims , noisily announcing their low prices , and generally behaving like vulgar mountebanks at a fair ! Surely a respectable merchant should know better . Soon fences and walls were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Litfass set up pillars at street corners to accommodate all the posters . Some of these pillar hoardings survive in France to this day . Now that the merchant stocked also craftsmen 's manufactures , such as clothes , shoes , carts , knives , etc. , he had to have some knowledge of these articles or else his customers would go back to the old master // craftsman who , as it was , kept telling them that anyone buying articles at the shop was merely throwing away his money . Only the expert , they said , could provide the right article , and the only expert was the man who manufactured it . But how was a small shopkeeper who stocked everything under the sun and who spent all his waking hours in his shop to acquire any expert knowledge of his goods ? The manufacturers sent out their travellers with the latest samples ? fashionable cottons , sound woollen materials , precious silks , plain sheets . Their job was to sell , to bring back orders so that the " iron angels " could be employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coventry and Schmalkalden , from Nurnberg and Stuttgart ; there were the travellers of the great merchanthouses in Bremen , Amsterdam , Le Havre , and London , offering coffee , cocoa , sugar , tobacco , and tea . They would all harangue the small shopkeeper , praising their goods , bent on selling as much as possible . They would offer credits , they would raise all sorts of hopes to make their customer place an order . He could turn away all those who came later , so long as he could be talked into making his purchase now . Balzac has portrayed for us one of those highly skilled salesmen , the great Haudissard , whose persuasive powers overcame all resistance ; he sold everything he took with him on his journey . They were the battles which brought victory for modern capitalism . Inventors had created the steam-engine , spinning-machines and looms , blast furnaces , railways and steamships , the ginning-machine for cotton , and the first machine tools . Entrepreneurs had built their factories , installed machines , recruited labour in the countryside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for marketing their products they continued to be dependent on the retailer . But how , from his modest little shop , was he to attract customers and persuade them to buy factory-made articles instead of making everything themselves ? To begin with , there was a shortage of ready money . The average weekly wage in English cotton-mills was 25 shillings , but during the subsequent years declined again as the cost of food dropped . About the middle of the century the average wage was 22 shillings a week . There was not much a worker could buy for that money . And yet wages in the cotton-mills of the flourishing industrial towns were relatively good . // The average wage of a fully employed worker in England in 179$ was no more than 13s. 6d . The wage increase during the war was more than offset by the rising cost of living . Then came the difficult years leading to the depression of the 1820 's . By 1850 the average wage had again declined to 17 shillings a week , yet the price-level then was much the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rural population , which still made up nearly four-fifths of the total in Germany , France , and Italy , and nearly two-thirds in England , had very little ready cash . How , then , was the small shopkeeper to persuade these people that it was cheaper and more advantageous for them to buy everything in his shop ? The problem seemed insoluble . First of all , the public had to buy merchandise at the shops so that the factories could work to full capacity ; but to do this they needed ready cash , and that had to be earned somewhere . Manufacturers were spurring on their travellers ; desperately they were looking for crack salesmen . ' But no retailer could buy from them more than he was able to resell . Surely , the shopkeeper would argue , the demand of a small town was constant . Before long , booths selling spirits to the workmen sprang up outside the factory gates on pay day , and stalls where women and girls would be persuaded to part with their hard-earned money on some trinket or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole week was absorbed ? to the detriment of the local shops and , ultimately , the factories which needed a big turnover . In Britain the workers united in consumer co-operatives in order to cut out the expensive ' middleman , in the belief that here lay the solution of the problem . The turnover , however , was still far below the greatly increased volume of production , simply because there was no adequate distributive apparatus . This , in turn , placed industry under the pressure of intensified competition , and this pressure it passed on by paying lower wages . But just because these wages were so low there was great poverty and hardship in the industrial areas and , consequently , the turnover there remained small . Only if the distributive apparatus was extended and fundamentally reorganized would the industrial age have a clear road ahead . Was this at all feasible within the narrow confines of Europe ? In 1858 there were , in the whole of Prussia , 39,300 independent commercially active persons with 22,900 employees . In other words , only every other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there might be an apprentice as well as an employee , but for the most part a shopkeeper would run his business merely with the help of his family . He would stand behind his counter , chatting with his customers , all of whom he would know personally . They would endlessly haggle with him about prices , since each article was a little different from another and there was always something to be found that might justify a discount . How , in these circumstances , was a shopkeeper to find the time and energy for introducing a new line , for talking his customers into buying a new article , as those grandiloquent travelling salesmen expected him to ? The small shopkeeper could not afford to go in for brash advertising . In spite of his legal freedom ' he was still very much in the grip of the traditional guild outlook . His customers expected the same sound merchandise that they had bought from him for many years and which they knew from their parents and grandparents . The manufacturers could find some one else to market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market his large output on the old continent of Europe . Overseas , however , where there were no obstinate artisans making a fuss about their quality work , and no middle class stubbornly clinging to old habits , it should be possible to find a large-scale market . Lancashire cotton cloth positively flooded the Indian market . The result was disastrous . Under the onslaught of the factory-made goods India 's age-old crafts collapsed . Even the Indian spinner with his modest hand-operated spinning-wheel could not produce as cheaply as the steam-driven iron machines ; even the indigent Indian peasant could not supply cotton as cheaply as the Alabama planter with his ginning-machines and his Negro slaves . The collapse of India 's crafts meant the collapse of an important part of her economy . The country became impoverished . Wherever European industry was seeking a new market , in India or Africa or the South American republics ? everywhere its superior competitive power ruined the local crafts and , with them , the potential customers for Europe 's ready-made goods . After all , the poor people of Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only truly receptive market was the United States of America . IS The Beginnings of Global Economics AN UNENDING PROCESSION of covered wagons was laboriously moving through the wilderness . Ever since Daniel Boone , the prototype of James Fenimore Cooper 's " leather-stocking " hero , had crossed the mountains which separated the coastal strip along the Atlantic from the measureless plains of the Mississippi basin people had been moving into the interior of the country to make their fortunes . They were not after gold , they did not expect to find mineral wealth ? all they wanted was land . Did they fully realize what was in store for them ? From Cumberland on the upper Potomac the road wound its way through the mountains to Wheeling on the Ohio ? a rough , narrow track , cut by watercourses and huge fallen trees , over rocks and through deep sand . Until about 1840 most of the arrivals in the West came by the famous Cumberland trail . Once he had left Cumberland behind him a man had to depend on himself alone . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with world traffic , with the rapidly growing cities and the flourishing factories . Alone he would penetrate into a world yet undeveloped , a world without roads and bridges , without towns and villages , indeed without houses or huts . There was nothing . Everything had to be created from scratch . The vast territory was void of human beings . Only a few wild Red Indian tribes roamed the plains ? Indians resisting the influx of the white man and desperately attacking him . They had to be pushed back by force . The development of the Mississippi basin would depend entirely 319 // on whether the settlers succeeded in trading their surpluses of wheat , maize , and meat for weapons , axes , gunpowder and lead , for nails , textiles , and cooking-pots . The men who arrived in the West through the narrow bottleneck of the Cumberland trail saw before them the vast plains as yet unclaimed , plains which seemed only to wait for a hard-working farmer , to receive the seed and then to yield crops a hundredfold . But did these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gunpowder , every knife , and every needle would have to be imported along this same road and that these articles would have to be paid for by their own agricultural produce which , in its turn , would have to be taken eastwards along that same lengthy and laborious route ? The question was not merely one of transport but also of who was to accept these agricultural surpluses . After all , there was still plenty of unused land between the coast and the mountains . The original forest had long been cut down in Massachusetts and New York , so that the inhabitants of those areas could now feed themselves from their own land . Who , then , was to buy the grain whose price must inevitably reflect the high costs of complicated transport ? There was no doubt that the farmer putting his plough to the wide open spaces of the Ohio basin was undertaking a considerable risk . The people who emigrated from the Old World of Europe left behind them also the traditional social order . At the head of the State was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the clergy , the nobility , and the common people . The peasant , tied to his land and unfree , served the nobility , toiling in the fields of his feudal landlord , doing whatever his master told him . He was not even free to choose his religion . " A subject takes the religion of his overlord " ? that was the formula thought up by jurists at an earlier date . This oppressive social pattern did not always end even when a man landed on the American coast . There were still far too many laws and regulations , officials and feudal landowners . But in the West , beyond the mountains , there was freedom . If a man found his fellows irksome , if he felt they were trying to impose on him their way of living , their religious beliefs and their political views , exact taxes from him , or impose on him distasteful tasks , he need only pack up his belongings and with his covered wagon move farther to the West , towards the frontier which , year after year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigrants arrived in America practically penniless : they were lucky if they had been able to pay for their crossing and bring with them enough clothing and seeds for the first few months . A payment had then to be made to the Government for one 's land . Only rarely would an immigrant 's means go beyond that . But what about the farming equipment that was necessary , or the tools which would enable a man to pursue his trade ? As a rule the merchant would advance the money for wagons , implements , cattle and horses , seeds , and even food . In the autumn he would take over the harvest in order to resell it on the coast . In the small communities there was one inexorable law : a man had to pay his debts , he had to keep his word , he had to discharge his obligations , deliver the goods he had promised , accept and punctually pay for the goods he had ordered . His neighbours would see to that . Even before they built their church or their town-hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tardy debtors . They had their reasons . Survival in this boundless vastness of America depended on the merchandise supplied by the merchant ? from rifles and axes down to the rum for the Red Indians . Not to mention such welcome luxuries as tobacco for a man 's pipe , tea for the cold winter evenings , or sugar , salt , and spices to make the daily fare more palatable . After all , there was little variety in a mid-Western farmer 's diet ; he ate only what he grew . Occasionally a welcome change might be provided by the animals he hunted or the fish he caught . In every small settlement there was a merchant ? the most important and most powerful man in the village . His store would look odd enough : barrels of syrup standing on the floor , sausages hanging from the rafters , mice scurrying about , nibbling the sacks of flour , ploughshares and scythes stacked against the wall , knives of every size , bales of cotton , woollens and linens , paper , nibs , and ink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The shopkeeper himself was away most of the time . He might be riding his mule from farm to farm , offering cloth or buying up grain ; he might be taking his covered wagon along the bumpy Cumberland trail to Philadelphia , New York , or Baltimore to stock up with ploughshares or to sell wheat . He would always grant credit . He would chalk up a man 's debt . Accounts were settled when the harvest was in . As a rule his customers would pay not in cash but in kind ? with the grain or the wool they // had produced and which the merchant would accept against the farmer 's inflated debts . The merchant was variously regarded as a benefactor or as a usurer under whose avarice and graspingness the village community groaned ? according to whether he happened to be giving credit or relentlessly collecting debts . Anyone not paying punctually was mercilessly declared bankrupt : he would lose everything he owned , he would be driven out of his house and home or clapped in the pillory to be mocked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sundry . To be a merchant in the Wild West ' required a considerable stock of courage and confidence , as well as a hard and inflexible will . Everybody wanted credit , far more than they could ever hope to repay ; everybody got into serious difficulties when the time of settlement arrived . The harvest ? not unnaturally ? did not always turn out as good as had been hoped in the spring , and prices rarely reached the figures one had anticipated ; besides , who would have thought that a man 's debt could grow so rapidly ? Every glass of rum , every tot of whisky increased it . Or had the merchant cheated ? What use was the neatly made-out bill with its numerous entries ? It meant nothing to the simple borderman who felt entirely at the mercy of the cunning merchant and usurer . Often enough a hand would reach for the gun to square accounts in that way . A good deal of psychology was required for granting the appropriate amount of credit to the right man , firmness to turn down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threats , a friendly , open manner to hold one 's own in the community , good humour to keep on amicable terms with those wild characters and so as not to lose one 's customers , a good head for business in order to stock the most favourable merchandise at all times and to pay the appropriate price for agricultural surpluses ? and , above all , a strong personality which would not panic even in the worst confusion and trouble . It may not be fortuitous that three Presidents of the United States of America had at one time been merchants out West ? Andrew Jackson , Abraham Lincoln , and Harry Truman . All three , admittedly , made a failure of their commercial careers . The merchant in the Middle West was only a minute wheel in the great machinery of American economic life . He possessed neither the capital nor the necessary overseas connexions to develop trade in the new areas by his own resources . The real wireThe // pullers were down by the coast ? the big merchants with their ties with Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They , in turn , gave credit to the small Mid-Western shopkeeper ; they supplied whatever he had ordered , they instructed him to buy up an entire harvest , they fixed the prices which so often infuriated the disappointed farmers . America was rich not only in farmland but also in mineral deposits such as coal , ores , and ? though still unsuspected at the middle of the century ? oil . From London and Liverpool , from Lille and Paris , from Hamburg and Chemnitz , came the buyers who took everything that was being produced ? first the cotton , which was getting increasingly short in view of the growing number of mills it had to feed ; then grain , which had been finding a ready market ever since Britain abolished its corn duties ; and finally bacon and lard . The Cumberland trail had long ceased to be sufficient ; merchandise was now shipped to the Gulf of Mexico down the Ohio and the Mississippi . In 1817 the first steamship sailed from New Orleans to Cincinnati ; two years later as many as sixty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mississippi . As a result transport costs were halved . The merchants in Philadelphia , Baltimore , and New York watched their customers moving away . What use was it to them that large numbers of immigrants arrived in their cities only to set out on the great trek to the West ? Once they had crossed the Allegheny Mountains they were lost to the merchants on the Atlantic seaboard . They were absorbed in the rival transport network which was based on the rivers of the Mississippi basin . In 1817 the New Yorkers began the construction of the Erie Canal , which provided a direct link between the Atlantic coast and the Great Lakes . As a result , transport costs from New York to Buffalo dropped from ioo dollars per ton to 8 dollars . Philadelphia and Baltimore likewise tried to drive canals towards the West ? in vain . With redoubled vigour they therefore turned to the building of railroads . Within a few decades the iron rails ran from the Atlantic ports over the mountains to Pittsburg and Cincinnati , carrying vast quantities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and European industrial goods to the newly opened territories . World trade was increasingly shifting away from the eastern shores of the Atlantic , the Mediterranean , and the Indian Ocean towards the coast of the United States . An ever-growing volume of merchandise // was passing through the American ports from Boston to Baltimore . The merchants resident there were no longer content ? as their fathers and forefathers had been ? to act as agents for the great , all-powerful merchant houses of London and Liverpool . They wanted to have their own share in the world trade , independently of Britain . Ever since the eighteenth century the New England states had been supplying to the West Indies the products of the temperate zone ? fish , timber , grain , and meat ? either in exchange for their sugar and rum , or merely to earn the pounds they needed to pay for the import of British industrial manufactures into North America . The scope of the fishing industry grew as consumption in the interior of the country increased . Moreover , the extensive fishing grounds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result , there was an adequate supply of experienced sailors and skilled skippers . That was the basis of what eventually was to become a world-wide shipping trade . New England 's magnificent oak forests , unmatched anywhere in the world , were her principal asset in shipbuilding . They enabled the building of sailing ships that developed a hitherto unparalleled speed . During the long war years , which continued until 1815 , the heaviest possible merchantmen had been necessary ? ships powerful enough to carry cannon to ward off ' enemy attacks . Safety had been more important than speed . Yet even before 1812 sailing ships had been built in Baltimore on a new system : a relatively narrow beam and the greatest possible sail-carrying capacity . Thus a long , slender vessel was born , with a sharp long bow , and the three masts slanting backward and carrying rectangular sails . The first great clipper for the high seas was built in Baltimore in 18 3 3 : it attained the then exceptional speed of eighteen knots . It simply left all other ships standing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on long runs . Their great age coincided with the discovery of gold in California and Australia . The early pioneers had struggled across the American continent on their slow covered wagons , over impassable tracks , across turbulent rivers , constantly menaced by nature itself , by arid deserts and towering mountains , as well as by hostile Indians trying to prevent them from occupying their land . Their journey often took many months . And now the swift clippers took their fortune-seeking passengers to the Isthmus of Panama , where they disembarked them , or later even // round the tip of South America and then all the way up the coast to San Francisco . Some 80,000 people were carried by the clippers during the first year of the Californian gold rush . And when news reached Britain of the gold finds in Australia , the clippers carried 400,000 passengers from the mother country to the colony in the southern hemisphere . No wonder that 16o clippers were built during the first four years of the gold rush . They yielded enormous profits . But when the freight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case of carrying people rapidly to where they hoped to make their fortune but of carrying merchandise which could not support such high tariffs , the shape of the ships underwent a change . The very slender vessels were replaced by a somewhat broader type , the " medium clipper , " capable of carrying more cargo . Though no longer quite so fast , it was still faster than most . The principal field of the medium clipper was the China trade . The English consumers could discern at once whether their tea had been rocked across the tropical seas on an old-type , slow , lumbering East-Indiaman , or whether a fast clipper had brought it quickly to the temperate zone . They refused to accept any but the best tea ? that which had best kept its delicious flavour . The dealers on the London tea exchange were outbidding each other in purchasing the freshest tea and offering it to their clients . They offered high rewards to the first ship to reach England from China with the new tea harvest . The names of the ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every tea-drinker . The British public 's sporting instinct was roused . There was , for instance , the famous Nightingale which was built in 1851 and which sailed the seas for fully forty years . Another tea clipper was the Witch of the Wave . There was tremendous jubilation when the Gutty Sark ( built 1869 ) covered the distance from China to England at an average daily speed of 363 nautical miles ? a record for a teaclipper . Because they were so fast , the clippers practically left standing the men-of-war whose task it was to arrest the slave trade from ' West Africa to North America . Once these fast ships had gained the open sea no warship could possibly catch them . That was why they were used also for the illegal trade in opium . The faster the journey , the smaller the risk . Before long , the merchants generally were unwilling to wait for their regular merchandise as long as they had done in the past . // They instructed their agents in China , India , Australia , or South America to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a revolution in the maritime freight business . Clippers were now sailing all the seven seas . They shortened the journey between New York and San Francisco from 16o to about 90 days . The Sovereign of the Seas , built in 1852 and the biggest sailing ship ever to be launched , covered 411 nautical miles in a single day ? an average of 17 nautical miles per hour . Only the Lightning , built by the American Donald McKay , surpassed that speed . The British stood helpless in the face of the superior American vessels . They complained that their great sail-ships were hanging about week after week in the East Indies waiting for cargo , while one American clipper after another sailed out to England with their holds filled to capacity . Were the British to watch helplessly as the trident , that symbol of the dominion over the seas , passed from British to American hands ? As the tonnage of the American merchant fleet kept rising , Britain 's continued to decline alarmingly . Then , suddenly , came the turning point . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous engineer Brunel , then only twenty-nine , had proposed to the Great Western Railway Company the construction of a steamer , made of iron , to provide a passenger service between Liverpool and New York . Three years later this vessel , the Great Western , built under Brunel 's direction , made her first voyage across the Atlantic . Brunel was not yet satisfied with her performance . He conceived the idea of propelling the ship not by paddle-wheels but by means of a screw . The Great Britain , the first long iron ship driven by a propeller , made her maiden voyage from Liverpool to New York in 1845 . But Brunel was still not satisfied . He wanted a bigger and faster ship yet . In 1858 the Great Eastern was launched ? a huge ship with a gross tonnage of 19,000 tons , or fourteen times more than the Great Western ( 1340 tons ) which only twenty years previously had been admired as one of the great wonders of the world . But the new ship was ill-fated from the start . To begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was having her launched sideways , because of her enormous hull , but he checked the movement so much that the ship got stuck and could not be made seaworthy for another three months . The shippers went bankrupt as a result . The next firm to take over the Great Eastern also suffered heavy losses , as they could not find sufficient cargo for the // enormous vessel . The outsize ship had to be withdrawn from ordinary shipping and used only for cable-laying in the Atlantic . Commercially this large steamship may have been a failure , but as an engineering feat it represented a crucial turning-point . Steam rapidly supplanted sail ; iron ships took the place of wooden ones ; and the British once more outstripped the Americans in the shipping trade . But before long the American shippers also ordered steamships to be built . American engineers , too , went in for bold new ideas , and the United States Government paid out subsidies in order to keep the Atlantic shipping routes under the U.S. flag . One American ship-owner , E. K. Collins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 3670 tons , developed a speed of 131 knots . However , after two accidents the government withdrew its subsidies . Cornelius Vanderbilt made one last effort to organize a trans-Atlantic service at his own expense , but soon gave up the race . The American paddlesteamers were no match for the British propeller-driven ones . During the next thirty years the Americans confined themselves to letting their steamers ply on the rivers or in coastwise traffic : they left the high seas to the British . As a result , Britain alone profited from the tremendous upsurge in world trade about the middle of the nineteenth century . British vessels handled the vast shipments of passengers and freight over all the seas . British ship-owners made all the profits . They carried the raw materials ? principally cotton from the southern states of the U.S.A. to supply the English textiles industry ; they brought home the foodstuffs to feed the ever-growing population in the industrial areas . The world 's industrial production was increasingly concentrating in Britain . Would the Americans let themselves be beaten in this field too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States imposed a high protective tariff on imported textiles and ironware . Why should the British exclusively supply the American market ? Anything Manchester and Birmingham could do the Yankees in the New England states must surely be able to do as well . As it was , all the profits went to the high and mighty British firms which were established in the harbour towns and were graciously granting credits . What America needed was manufacturing industries , not merely trade . But the farmer out West wanted to buy cheaply in order to export cheaply . His customers were for the most part in Europe , and it was // from there that he wanted to import his machines , his farming implements , and the textiles which were largely woven from his own cotton , by people nourished by his grain . In 1832 the cotton state of South Carolina arbitrarily forbade its officials to collect the monstrous tariffs decreed by the Federal Government . But this piece of disobedience did not go down at all well with President Andrew Jackson . " Old Hickory , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchants of the great coastal cities who had ruthlessly declared him bankrupt in his younger years ; his anger was above all directed against anything to do with banking and credits . The honest farmer , it seemed to him , might toil as hard as he could , but in the end the rapacious merchants would fleece him and then cast him off like an old glove . Banks , to Andrew Jackson , were the personification of those anonymous , dangerous , and uncanny powers of commerce ; they would arbitrarily fix prices , they would decide whether the sun of prosperity should shine from the sky or the icy wind of depression shrivel all life . They were all-powerful . Thus it came about that Andrew Jackson , at // one time the representative of the borderman 's interests and the champion of States ' rights against an over-powerful Union , enforced protective tariffs . Henceforward these tariffs were only to be raised , never to be lowered . The farmers had to foot the bill . The reaction came very promptly . In 1837 the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe 's demand for cotton and grain kept increasing , American supplies were growing even more quickly ; her surpluses were a drug on the world market . Were there any shortages at all in this country of unlimited possibilities ? What about human labour ? Millions of immigrants were arriving from the Old World . In defiance of all prohibitions and of British warships slavers were still importing Negro slaves from Africa . Naturally , these were a good deal more expensive now . Whereas in 1832 a young , vigorous Negro slave could be had for some Soo dollars , five years later , shortly before the depression , the price had risen to 1300 dollars . The cultivation of cotton continued to be expanded . The manufacturers literally snatched the cotton out of the merchants ' hands . The price of cotton rose to over 17 cents per pound ; the cotton exchanges were in a fever . Then , suddenly , the wild speculation collapsed . Between 1845 and 1848 the price of cotton dropped to eight cents ; even for a top-quality slave a planter would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were unable to survive the depression . No sooner had a factory closed its gates for lack of customers , or of a financial backer , than the merchants would persuade some other entrepreneur to take over the factory ; as an inducement they would promise orders and advances . A merchant could make a profit even at low prices : he would buy more cheaply in order to sell more cheaply . The North American farmer was no peasant wedded to a centuryold tradition , suspicious of all change and progress . He was a businessman who knew how to calculate ; he knew his overheads , he knew the approximate value of his coming harvest , and he knew the price offered him by the merchant . Any farmer distrustful of that price could sell his grain as a standing crop or else sell it on the exchange for future delivery ; there were always merchants willing to contract for future deliveries and manufacturers anxious to assure themselves of long-term supplies of raw materials . // Provided a farmer had courage enough he could expand his acreage under crops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was available in unlimited quantity ? the best possible , highly fertile soil . Year after year the railways thrust deeper into the continent ; wherever they arrived the virgin land opened up as to an " Open sesame ! " of the Arabian tale . Along the new iron roads trains filled with wheat and maize , with pork and lard , and , in the south , with cotton , rolled towards the coast ; laden with machinery , ploughs , and clothing they returned . Transport had become cheap . The only shortage in this headlong expansion was one of human labour . Even an overpopulated Europe could no longer supply a sufficient number of immigrants . The merchants organized a human trade of a new kind . Their agents would travel from country to country , from village to village , collecting the sturdiest and most adventurous men for shipment to America ; they promised them land , they advanced them the passage money , they granted them credits for seedstock , cattle , and farming implements . Behind the settlement companies stood the railway companies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strip of land on both sides of each new railway line . Certainly America 's agricultural production need not , for any lack of land , fall short of what an overpopulated Europe required . Into the vast , empty spaces of North America the merchants pumped tremendous quantities of rails , locomotives and rolling stock , mowers and threshing machines , ploughs and axes , houses complete with all household effects , furniture and clothing , luxury foods like sugar , coffee , tobacco , rum and tea , soap and glassware , books and musical instruments . A farmer need only go to his local store and express a wish ? and pay . But money to him meant his harvest . As soon as the harvest was gathered in the buyers would appear with their well-lined wallets , bidding for wheat , maize , livestock and cotton , rice , sugar , and tobacco . Their firms would keep them informed about prices , according to the state of the market on the big corn exchanges . The farmers might hesitate . Was the price good enough ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first rush of buying had died down ? On the other hand , there were their accumulated debts of the past year . New seed had to be ordered , new ploughs and wagons had to be bought ; stocks had to be laid in for the 4 // coming months in case heavy rains or snow cut communications with the outside world . In this to and fro , in this free interplay of supply and demand , prices found their own level . There was no question of a fair ' price , or of a food-growing class ' that had to be pampered and feather-bedded , or of some organic integration ' of town and country . If a man could not supply at the ruling market price he had better get out of American agriculture . It had no permanent , divinely ordained market , nor a government with consideration for the much-harassed farmer 's wife . On the other hand , American agriculture was free to sell anywhere in the world because it produced on more favourable terms than any other country . When at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived more cheaply than ever before . There was ready employment to be found in the Birmingham steelworks which supplied railway rolling stock to America . The Old World and the New supplemented each other ideally : the former had the factories , the blast furnaces , the scientists , and the engineers , while the latter had the wide , open farming areas with their hard-working people who urgently needed machines and technical equipment . The new steamships now carried across the ocean very much larger cargoes in a much shorter time . In 186o Britain exported merchandise worth ? 300,000,000 ; one-third of this total went to the British Empire and one-sixth to the United States . The list was headed by cotton cloth with nearly 40,000,000 pounds sterling , followed by iron bars , machines , and coal ; woollen cloth , once the mainstay of England 's foreign trade , ranked only fifth . Finally there was pottery , glass , weapons and ammunition , knives , soap , books , and stationery . British imports consisted almost exclusively of foodstuffs and raw materials , headed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agriculture and Britain 's heavy industry both flourished simultaneously ? the iron foundries of Birmingham , the engineering factories of Northampton , the shipbuilding yards of Glasgow , and the cotton-mills of Manchester . Division of labour meant the choice of the most favourable location , and production under the most favourable transport and working conditions ? in short , acceptance of no other yardstick than price . Why was that not possible in continental Europe ? There each nation was barricaded , suspiciously , behind its customs barriers : nothing must be bought that could be manufactured at home , no matter under what // conditions and at what cost ! Why throw away good money on some foreign manufacture when it could be given to a fellow citizen as a reward for his trouble and work ? But modern economics can not be run like a medieval farmstead . Efficient production , low prices , consequently higher consumption , bigger production , and a higher standard of living ! That was the new slogan of the merchants about the middle of the nineteenth century . When the young Bonaparte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , became the Emperor Napoleon III he tried in vain for a long time to introduce free trade in France . In the French parliament his words fell upon deaf ears . The farmers ' league and the over-timid industrialists stuck firmly together . Only with great difficulties were the import duties on wheat and flour lowered slightly during the years of famine , and , during the years of industrial strain , the duties on coal , iron , steel , machines , and wool . In principle , however , France clung to protective tariffs . Napoleon III therefore conducted secret negotiations with Cobden , the British Minister , and in February 1860 a surprised world was informed of the conclusion of a trade treaty . All import bans were revoked and duties greatly reduced . Raw materials were to be imported entirely free from duty and finished articles subject only to a moderate rate . Britain , for her part , made considerable concessions : French silks and fashion goods were to be completely exempted from customs duty , and that on wine and spirits would be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such wealth should be enjoyed by all nations " ? that , in the words of a contemporary , was the principle underlying the trade treaty . It inaugurated a new age , the age of free trade . Four hundred dismayed French industrialists requested an audience with the Emperor in the hope of making him realize the danger which threatened French industry from that of Britain . The Emperor did not even receive them . There would be no more misguided consideration for manufacturers muddling along in the old way , for backward producers or inefficient farmers ! Prices should rule unchecked . Anyone unable to supply at the current price in the world market would have to get out of the race sooner or later . Only he who could produce cheaply had any prospects . Close co-operation between Britain and France was bound to benefit both nations , even if some individual or other suffered . The Emperor was proved right . // In the single decade between 1857 and 1866 French foreign trade was doubled : it rose from 3,100,000,000 francs to 6,200,000,000 francs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's surprise the French textile industry survived successfully in the face of British competition . And indeed why not ? In the face of danger the French had made a supreme effort : they had invented new patterns , new machines , new colour effects . For centuries they had been the leaders of fashion . Why then should they now be defeated by the British ? They could import their cotton at the same prices as their British rivals ? the merchants of Liverpool saw to that as much as those of Rouen , Paris , or Lille . The workmen contented themselves with the same wages , especially as wheat was now imported cheaply and the cost of living had correspondingly declined . True , Britain was able to step up its woollen cloth exports to France considerably , but in exchange she now imported French silks which , until recently , had been almost prohibitively expensive because of the high import duty . In the 1860 's British exports of cotton cloth to France did not yet exceed those to the Netherlands . At the great World Exhibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain has derived comparatively little advantage from the trade treaty , while agricultural and industrial production in France has undergone a remarkable increase . " The other European countries were still reluctant to accept the idea of free trade , but they lowered customs tariffs and slowly ? so as to harm no interested party ? integrated themselves in world trade . In 1862 Prussia signed a customs agreement with France which envisaged much lower tariffs than hitherto ; the duties on the import of cotton goods were greatly reduced , and so were those on iron , silk , leather , and textiles . The State was anxious to open a wider market for its growing industry , and it felt strong enough to compete with France and even with Britain . Reluctantly the remaining members of the German Customs Union followed suit . The heart of this world-wide business was the city of London . Every day , indeed every hour , ships arrived in port from all over the world ? for the most part windjammers , but also , more and more often , steamships making fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much admired at one time , were surpassed by the St Catherine Dock . A ship of 3000 to 4000 tons was now turned round within a week , // whereas at the beginning of the century a whole month or even six weeks had been needed for unloading an East Indiaman of no more than Soo tons . Along the docks stood the vast warehouses where huge quantities of sugar , rum , coffee , tea , tobacco , silk , wheat , wine , wool , cotton , linen , copper , tin , lead , spices , timber , coal , iron and steel , ivory and ostrichfeathers accumulated . Everything was warehoused there . Since 1803 it had been possible to store merchandise in bond ; without special dues these goods could be kept there in order to be imported either into England or resold abroad . Anyone needing merchandise in a hurry would turn to London . There he would find whatever he required . The banks paid advances on these warehoused stocks . Just as all the world 's important shipping firms had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big banking firms or , at least , their agents . There were the big private banking-houses like that of Rothschild ; since 1834 there had been additionally the first big share-issuing bank , the London and Westminster Bank . The London banks granted short credits all over the world ; they discounted bills , and accepted deposits which could be withdrawn at any time . The banks were backed by the Bank of England , which , since 183o , also accepted foreign bills . The big insurance companies provided cover against every conceivable risk ? fire and water , accidents in transit and theft , shipwreck or confiscation on the high seas or in foreign lands . Powerful life assurance companies accumulated a vast capital which they put at the disposal of commerce . The biggest of them all was Lloyd 's , who , against an appropriate premium , would relieve other insurers of part of their risks by way of re-insurance . The Stock Exchange was the hub of the City : there the shares of the most important companies , international loans , and bills of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world were dealt in . Should a new railway be built in the United States ? Could Brazil afford a new port ? Should new blast furnaces be blown in in the Ruhr ? All that was decided , more often than not , on the London Stock Exchange . It was there that all great financial transactions were discussed , that countries , entrepreneurs , and firms were weighed and appraised , and their credit assessed , approved , or rejected . A hint was enough for the Stock Exchanges of Frankfurt , Amsterdam , Paris , Vienna , or Berlin to show reserve . A warning was enough for the // Rothschilds or the Bleichroders to keep off a particular loan , a particular credit or a particular share . On the commodity exchanges ? the wool exchange , the iron and steel exchange , the coal exchange , and the Baltic exchange ? the world market prices were discussed and fixed which might bring the small farmer in the United States to the verge of despair , which might decide // the fate of a sheep-breeder in Patagonia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chilean Andes . It was in London that all the news accumulated which alone made it possible to form a true picture of what was really going on in the world . To fix prices one had to know everything : the condition of the crops in Wisconsin as much as in Southern Russia and France , the size of the harvest of sugar-cane , tea , and coffee , the production of the coal-mines in Britain , in the Ruhr , and in Pittsburg , the volume of copper manufacture in Utah and in Chile , the development plans for the zinc-mines of Upper Silesia and the tin-mines of Bolivia . Was there going to be a revolution in the Argentine ? Was the Tsar getting ready to pounce on the Turks ? Would the Paris Government fall ? Was the Vienna Government letting itself in for risky adventures in the Balkans ? The Stock Exchanges would buzz with reports and rumours , with official and private assessments of the situation . More and more accurate statistics became available . Nowhere were even the smallest details studied with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And nowhere were the first signs of a political earthquake noticed sooner than on the London Stock Exchange . The flow of information had greatly improved since Reuter founded his great news agency in 18g9 . In every important centre on earth his representatives and correspondents were gathering the latest news . All the world listened to London in order to form a picture of the world situation . And rightly so . For it was in London that all threads met ? those of commerce and those of politics . London was the hub of an empire which girdled the whole world ; British ambassadors and consuls were continually sending home reports from all major capitals and trading-centres . Now and again the Government would tip off the Stock Exchange or the big banks ? secret information based on an intimate acquaintance with a foreign country , information that might foreshadow measures to be decided in the Cabinet Room . London was the great clearing centre ' of international trade , a vast pot into which one might confidently throw any demand or asset in order to pull out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to need at the moment , since all transactions were effected via London . Nowhere on earth were savings deposits , money reserves , claims , or Government securities as secure as in England . The currency // stood unassailable . " Safe as the Bank of England " was a phrase which stated no more than the truth . Jealously the City of London saw to it that the reputation of its banks remained untarnished . It kept an eye on all bills discounted in the City , indeed on all bills drawn anywhere in the world . If any were noted for protest , the foreign representative would at once report to his firm 's headquarters in the City . Were other firms likely to be affected ? An occasional protested bill here or there did not , of course , matter greatly . Some speculators , mostly small fry , might occasionally bite off more than they could chew ; inevitably some merchant or other might go bankrupt . But if protested bills were to accumulate , if even solid firms and old business friends should begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The City of London had the best overall picture of the situation ? the quantities stocked in its warehouses , the number of bills drawn , the amount of merchandise insured against fire or theft , the shipments still at sea . Perhaps the harvest in Eastern Europe had been a failure , but that in America had been good ? appropriate steps would have to be taken at once . Perhaps the American railways required large consignnients of steel rails which Germany 's young steel industry was in a position to supply . Offers would go to and fro , prices would fluctuate upward and downward . It was a daily struggle . Even though statistics were now providing reliable data for assessments , the practical merchant nevertheless liked to keep his ears open for what he could pick up on the Stock Exchange . What was its mood ? What were the brokers saying ? Were customers settling promptly ? What were suppliers demanding ? Were prices steady or were they unsteady ? It was on the London Stock Exchange that the world market price was settled . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world calculations were made in pounds sterling to facilitate comparison of quotations on the Stock Exchanges of Buenos Aires , Singapore , and Berlin . The pound sterling was firmly based on gold . The nineteenth century trusted blindly to the promise of the Bank of England to exchange a pound note for its full value in gold at any time . The Latin Mint Union ? France , Italy , Belgium , Spain , and Switzerland ? gave up its so-called silver currency in favour of gold : one franc equalled eighty German Pfennig . From 1872 the Mark was a gold currency . The international Stock Exchanges were not interested in tariffs . // Each country could tax its consumers as it chose ; the London Stock Exchange practised its world-wide free trade outside all customs barriers ? free on board ship for outgoing freight , and inclusive of freight costs and insurance in the port of destination for all incoming freight . " Fob " ( free on board ) and " Cif " ( cost insurance freight ) became internationally accepted concepts . Everywhere , tremendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroads traversed the Middle West , the Argentine pampas , and Southern Russia . That meant new orders for rails , locomotives , and rolling stock . Steamships were now sailing on all the oceans . The steamship enabled Britain to recapture her supremacy in shipping which she had temporarily lost to the Americans with their fast-sailing clippers . Steamships of 3000 to 5000 tons were built on the Mersey and on the Clyde . The Great Eastern , built by Brunel , had the then unparalleled displacement of 19,000 tons . New blast furnaces had to be built and blown in , factories had to increase their output of machines , cotton cloth , and chemicals . Suppose these elaborately woven threads of world trade were to come apart ? The first shock carne with the American Civil War . Ruthlessly the Northern States blockaded the rebellious South . There was no cotton coming on the market ; it was rotting on the plantations in the Southern States while the industrialists of Manchester , Mulhouse , and Saxony were anxiously wondering how long their stocks would last . All over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indies , in the West Indies , in South America , and in Africa . New plantations were laid out . No sooner had the shortage been overcome than peace came . Within a few years the cotton plantations in the devastated South were as prosperous as ever ? even without slaves . The population of Europe increased tremendously during the nineteenth century : from 187,000,000 in 1800 it rose to 266,000,000 about 1850 and to 401,000,000 by the end of the century . And there was nothing of the famine or starvation which the English author Malthus had prophesied for the rising flood of humanity . But then , what did Malthus know about world commerce ? Foodstuffs were imported by merchants from all over the world . The merchants would have their agents in Chicago , in Buenos Aires , in New York , in Cincinnati , in Odessa , and in Hamburg . Carefully they would study Stock Exchange quotations and turnovers , harvest // figures and consumer statistics , money in circulation and the amount of bills offered . They would study market analyses , orders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where were unsaleable quantities of grain , wool , or cotton accumulating ? Where did the supply of iron , steel , and wool exceed the demand ? The flood of orders continued to rise and prices to soar . In 1873 came the collapse . It hit the world of commerce with tremendous force : thousands of merchant-houses , many bearing old-established and venerable names , crashed overnight , many a speculator vanished from the scene , and industrial production dropped dramatically . World-wide economics are an exceedingly complex piece of machinery ? each little cog passes on its motion to its neighbour . The money spent by a consumer in , say , Dresden reaches a fazendeiro in Sao Paulo by a long , roundabout route . Along that route lie countless transactions . Only rarely was it possible to trade one commodity directly for another now that raw materials for industry accounted for such a large portion of world trade . The textile mills needed cotton , but the cotton-planters needed tractors and machines . Commerce had so stimulated agricultural and industrial production throughout the world that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Neither for their food supplies nor for their industrial raw materials did nations any longer rely on their own native territory . But was the European peasant to compete with the American farmer who employed the latest harvesting machines in his enormous fields , or with the Chinese coolie , the Egyptian fellah , or the American Negro ? Could a manufacturer in the Rhineland supply as cheaply as the mammoth trust in Pittsburg which sold its steel at ruinous prices in order to crush its poor competitors ? Were all workers and peasants to leave their homes and to move to wherever better and cheaper production was possible ? " Free competition is a menace ! " was the new cry that went up in Europe . Protective tariffs were the new order of the day . Industrialists allied themselves with the farmers in order to regulate and stabilize the home markets and freeze prices behind high customs barriers . In the world markets it was impossible to sell at cost price . There one had to sell at the ruling market price , or indeed at a competitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill , of course , had to be footed by the domestic consumer . His support as a voter , // however , was gained by appealing to him as an interested party ? as a farmer , as an industrial worker , or as an entrepreneur . Not because commerce had failed , but because of its triumph through low prices did the call for protective tariffs now ring out . In Le Havre the Americans were selling their beef and pork , as well as mutton from the Argentine , at half the price demanded by the French farmers . Wool from Australia and the Argentine effortlessly undercut that from Silesia , Mecklenburg , and Saxony . In 1885 the price of wheat in France dropped to 165 francs per ton . In 1879 Germany went over to protective tariffs ; France followed suit two years later . The road to disaster had been chosen : every decade the tariffs were raised . To each protective tariff decreed by one country another would reply with tariffs of its own , in order to protect its native producers . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be separately negotiated . Every concession meant a loss to some domestic interested party . Indeed , if one was not careful prices at home might drop ! And that was a terrible thought ! Friedrich List wrote in 1840 : Commerce is productive of values in an entirely different way from agriculture and manufactures . These produce goods , while commerce merely organizes the exchange of these goods . Commerce does not care what effect the goods imported by it will have on the nation 's morals , welfare or power . It imports poisons and medicines . It undermines entire nations by opium and brandy . In wartime it supplies weapons and ammunition to the enemy . It would , if only that were possible , gladly sell fields and meadows to foreign countries and , the last patch of land sold , would take ship and export itself ... . Another author , Maine , the spokesman of France 's opposition to free trade , declared in 1891 : How can they compare the privileged agriculture of the young nations with our own unfortunate farmers ? Ceaselessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soil weakened by centuries of cultivation . And all the time they are crushed by heavy taxes and the harsh necessity of military service . Is it really so unfair to demand from foreign agricultural produce an equalization of this injustice , for which our own farmers , surely , are not responsible ? " Kneel down in humility before the simple woollen stockings of the peasant ! " he called upon the Minister of Finance . " Protect the poor wretch ! " Only in the United States did the farmers side with the free traders because they wanted to market their vast surpluses in Europe . In // Europe , on the other hand , the peasants allied themselves with the industrialists in order to force protective tariff bills through their parliaments . The small backyard workshops , the countless family-owned coalmines , the small manufactories which had been only too pleased to have a big merchant pre-empt their entire production , advance them the cost of their raw materials , and pay cash upon delivery , had grown into gigantic enterprises of world-wide fame , technically efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew the world and had mastered the rules of banking as much as of marketing , and backed by the powerful banks whose representatives sat on their boards of directors . Business secrets existed no longer . The leading industrial nations sent their consuls to all foreign countries ; everywhere the big European banks had their representatives ? the British , the Germans , the French , the Spanish , the Italians . And in all those countries they found fellow-countrymen who had been washed up there by some destiny or other ? as settlers , as soldiers , as scientists , or as merchants . They founded their colonies where all new developments , in the ports and in the capital , were discussed among themselves . Whenever an industrial firm received an enquiry about a product it would obtain from its country 's consul , from the bank , or from one of the newly founded Chambers of Commerce , some information about the commercial standing of the enquirer . Manufacturers ' agents no longer had to ask the export firms whether any orders had been received from overseas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built bridges , port installations , electric power-stations , underground railways , tramways , or skyscrapers would send out its own representative who would work for them exclusively . As a rule they would also send along a technician , so that expert advice could be given on the spot to a prospective customer . Before very long it became generally known that the German manufacturers were glad to deliver even without the mediation of an exporter . Foreign merchants began to come to Germany , to inspect the latest products for themselves , and to place orders . The fairs in Germany changed their character . Merchandise itself was no longer displayed for sale , but only samples ; after the fair a factory would fulfil any orders as per sample . ' Thousands , tens of thousands , hundreds of // thousands of foreign customers would visit Leipzig twice a year in order to stock up with merchandise . A manufacturer with whom an order had been placed in Leipzig would then make tactful enquiries with the banks , the Chambers of Commerce , and the big international information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shanghai was good for credit . The postal system was delivering letters faster and faster , eventually also by aircraft . The telegraph could flash messages at lightning speed to any part of the world . Whereas in the past a manufacturer 's name had usually remained unknown ? the Hamburg exporters used carefully to remove all names of firms from the merchandise they handled ? present-day industry attaches much importance to the trade-mark . It guarantees quality , measure , and weight , and frequently prescribes the price . The names of big manufacturers ? Ford , Coty , Borsalino , or Zeiss ? are known the world over . Thanks to advertising the public has come to know the slogans of each make . A large part of commerce soon consisted of marketing . A manufacturer 's marketing apparatus became of decisive importance ; astonishing successes were achieved by some manufacturers through skilful advertising . They might seize a large , possibly the overwhelming , part of a particular market . They would create new markets for merchandise hardly dreamed of even by the technicians a few decades earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production . In Pittsburg , in Newcastle , in St Gobain , in Milan , in Essen , in Hochst , in Frankfurt , in Berlin , and in Pilsen vast enterprises grew up which supplied their products to the whole world . The industrialist everywhere had gained in standing and influence ; he might now employ thousands or tens of thousands of workers who owed their livelihood to his business efficiency . All eyes were centred on men like Rockefeller and Carnegie , Schneider-Creuzot and Skoda , Pirelli , Krupp and Bayer . The merchant was being eclipsed . Wealth was concentrated in a few hands ; it belonged almost exclusively to the big entrepreneurs , the big factory owners . Before the Civil War the United States had five millionaires ; there may in fact have been a few more . By the end of the century the number had grown to 3800 . Nine-tenths of the national wealth belonged to onetenth of the population in this democratic country which knew no // class distinctions , where newsboy might rise to millionaire . His ascent , however , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by way of production . In all countries the governments were being urged to ensure a market for the rising industries . By far the best thing would be to divide up the home market , to keep it free from ruinous competition . Cartels and trusts were formed to fix quotas and regulate prices . Competitors were to be eliminated ? or else bought up and incorporated in the giant trust , the steel trust , the oil trust , or the tobacco trust . Once all rivals had been absorbed the markets could be regulated at will . The free world market was getting smaller and smaller . Britain alone upheld the banner of free trade , but there too an increasingly vocal group of interest began to oppose it ? not only the spokesmen of her badly neglected agriculture , but also the industrialists who were watching enviously as their competitors in America and Germany built up an increasingly powerful industry behind high customs barriers . Joseph Chamberlain demanded protective tariffs for the British Empire . Even in the free markets political influence was to ensure advantages over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were becoming almost more important than competitive prices and quality . Each power was trying to secure the largest possible territories as markets for its industries . The mailed fist was breaking down locked doors . As early as 1853 an American fleet of warships compelled Japan to admit foreign merchants ; shortly afterwards the British and French jointly stormed the Taku forts . China had to permit the establishment of Legations in Peking and of Consulates in all the major towns ? but it was not until 1853 that the first foreign Ambassador was received in audience by the Emperor . The Chinese market was open once more ? the much-admired empire of the many millions of human beings . But would they prove to be as many consumers ? In the sixteenth century the emperor had expelled the Portuguese when their colonists in Ning-po had behaved improperly . The Dutch had had to be content with sitting in Formosa and dealing from there with Chinese traders from Canton ; the country itself had remained barred to them . Such considerations were alien to the new age . Industries lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made up of separate home markets each nation had to stake its claim wherever it was strong enough ? or believed itself a strong enough . This was demonstrated by the British , when , in the Opium War , they compelled China to admit the drug . Power was everything ! Thus , the age of protective barriers gave birth , almost inevitably , to the age of imperialism . With the end of free trade the prolonged period of peace also came to an end ? the pax Britannica , the period when merchants had measured the goods of the whole world by one yardstick alone ? price . 16 The Art of Selling IN 1852 Aristide Boucicaut opened the first department store in the heart of Paris . It was a tremendous success . The comparatively small shop became crowded with women . They all wanted to see the Bon Marche . Naturally , the same articles might be bought at any of the large , old-established shops , the magasins de nouveautes , but everybody wanted to see for themselves how Boucicaut displayed his materials , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales . And the low prices he charged ! It was all rather bewildering . What a merchant needs most is ideas . And courage . Boucicaut drastically reduced his profit margin . Whereas the Paris retailers would charge , on an average , 40 per cent . above their purchase price , Boucicaut contented himself with 20 per cent . His calculation was simple enough : provided his quick turnover allowed him to keep his general overheads below 15 per cent. , he would still be able to make a net profit of 5 per cent . In this way he could be 20 per cent . cheaper than his competitors . No self-respecting artisan , let alone an elegant shopkeeper , would have stood behind his counter from morning till night for a measly 5 per cent . Surely for the sake of such a meagre profit a man could not take the risk of his materials going out of vogue and remaining unsold ? especially now that fashions were changing so quickly . And besides , so many customers expected credit ! As if it mattered how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the turnover increased so would his profit ? and 5 per cent . on brisk sales might yield a great deal more than 40 per cent . 345 // with a slow turnover and losses from unsold stock . Boucicaut had calculated correctly : his overheads did not in fact exceed IS per cent . Another idea of his was fixed prices . Boucicaut would not even consider bargaining ; he marked all his goods with their final price and declared flatly that on no account would that price be reduced ? not even if an indignant customer flounced out of the shop . No customer had a price reduced by as much as a centime ? however much she pleaded , hesitated , or feigned indecision . No matter whether the customer was a celebrated opera star , a noble baroness , or the wife of an all-powerful minister : at Boucicaut 's they had to pay the same price as the wife of a minor civil servant . They were all customers . Every customer could see for herself the price of every article : it was prominently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unworried by assistants , the customer could make up her mind whether a purchase was really worth while . In point of fact it nearly always was ; after all , Boucicaut 's price was well below the ultimate figure to which some other shopkeeper might be beaten down ' after endless bargaining . But was not the very charm of shopping lost as a result ? that duel of flattery and lament between purchaser and vendor ? And was not every discount allowed by the vendor to the customer a token of courtesy , of respect for the customer 's name , position , or even just youth and personal charm ? Was Monsieur Boucicaut really so ungallant as to decline to discuss price altogether ? As recently as the eighteenth century retailers used to be punished for distributing handbills offering articles at fixed prices , because such advertisement ran counter to the rules of the guilds and the spirit of commerce . Nonsense , said Boucicaut . If after protracted haggling a customer had at last got a particularly fine length of material at a reduced price she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread round . Immediately her neighbour would burst in , full of indignation , and throw a frightful scene ; what else could a merchant do but reduce the price for her as well ? And before he knew where he was all his women customers would be haggling for hours . No ? only by charging fixed prices could all customers be kept satisfied in the long run . Nobody was obliged to buy anything in his shop , Boucicaut announced . Anyone could spend as long as he or she wished inspecting his displays // and studying his prices . A lady should never feel under an obligation to buy even the smallest trifle . Why not walk right in , ladies ? No overzealous assistant will pester you . We like you to see everything for yourselves . Everything is openly displayed . In the old type of shop all materials used to be kept at the back on high shelves . The assistant would ask in detail what precisely his customer desired ; he would consider carefully what colour and which pattern would be most suitable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the basement in order to produce some carefully wrapped bale or other . " This is the very thing for you , madam ! " As if a lady could make up her mind so quickly ! But the assistant would not let go . The fish was in the net and must not be allowed to escape . For that very reason customers would sometimes rather not enter a shop at all . Boucicaut caught his fish not in the net but with the bait of cheap prices , of irresistibly beautiful materials and brilliant colours . He knew the power of his bait : it would bring a customer back even after she had left the shop . Never harangue a customer . The lady must ask herself whether she can afford to miss this unique opportunity . She must be allowed time to day-dream a little ; this magnificent turquoise cloth with its flowing folds would suit her magnificently . What a temptation ! And the low price ! The price , Boucicaut knew , would allay all doubts more readily than the most eloquent salesman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that a customer could see more of them , make a better choice , and become really enthusiastic at the magnificent sight . First of all the curious had to be drawn into the shop ? and nothing did that more effectively than the reassuring , though deceptive , knowledge that there was no need to buy anything and that one could always walk out again . Boucicaut declared himself ready to take back any merchandise without question , either exchanging it for something else or by repayment of the price in full . No customer of his was ever to regret a purchase merely because she had allowed herself to be carried away too readily and now was finding herself landed with something she did not really want . If she discovered some other material which she liked better she need only say so . Instantly Boucicaut would exchange it . No need , ladies , to suffer torments of indecision . Make your choice , take your goods , pay your money . If you regret your purchase or if you are not // satisfied with what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere ? Boucicaut will gladly take it back . In vast numbers the curious Parisians streamed into his shop . They saw , they admired , they bought ; only very few thought of changing their purchases . They might have entered the shop mistrustfully or doubtfully , but they were swept off their feet ; the ladies were positively burrowing among the piles of material . Boucicaut 's sales in 1852 were worth 5oo,000 francs ; in 1860 they totalled 5,000,000 . Bon Marche became the model for department stores everywhere . Boucicaut had started with materials and haberdashery ; before long he added dresses and skirts , and eventually underwear , accessories , and shoes . He was a man of ever new ideas ? so much so that his partner was getting cold feet . He sold his share . That obsessed merchant Boucicaut could make his experiments by himself ? surely , that kind of thing could bring no good in the long run . But it did . In 1870 his turnover reached the downright fantastic sum of 20,000,000 francs . Boucicaut 's profit was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneers , then excited opposition by retailers , indignant criticism , and eventually imitators . Chauchard and Heriot opened a department store for a somewhat more exacting clientele ? the Louvre . Jaluzet , at one time the manager of a department in Boucicaut 's firm , founded the Printemps , which became an irresistible magnet for all visitors to Paris . Every one would go there to see with amazement what surprises and attractions the city of lights , the centre of the second empire , had to offer . The face of Paris was changing rapidly . The wide boulevards which the Emperor had laid out through the old narrow quarters brought light and air into the city centre . An elegant , leisured public would stroll down the wide streets to watch other passers-by and to view the new fashions and the shop windows . The day of the old tiny shops was gone , shops which were sometimes housed in basements with only a miserable lantern throwing light on a dismal room , on merchandise piled higgledy-piggledy on primitive wooden racks , stacked unlovingly , out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what there was . If he did not find what he wanted the shopkeeper would let him walk out unmoved ; fussy customers with requirements out of the ordinary were only a nuisance . This pattern of trade had its advantages and its drawbacks . A small // merchant could rely on his circle of customers . He would greet his customers like old friends , he would ask how the family were , and there would be some discussion of the latest news before getting down to business . The customer would rely on getting good sound merchandise which would keep for years . The customers , who would normally know one another , made or marred a merchant 's reputation . No merchant would try to lure away another 's customers . The mere idea was indignantly repudiated . The eighteenth-century police regulations of the city of Mainz stipulated expressly that " no man shall take away another man 's sale or increase the price of a merchandise by higher bidding ; no man shall intrude upon another man 's bargain or drive so hard a bargain himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of the nineteenth century a retailer believed that to sell in a way damaging to his fellow citizen would not be profitable to him in the end . While a business was run by its owner ? who might have had an assistant or two , although these did little more than fetch and carry ? a customer could always argue about the price . The merchant had to make certain concessions to a well-established customer or a lady of // standing merely because they invariably came back to his shop . In these circumstances , naturally , there was no need for any special display . ' The well-known customer would state her wish , and the shopkeeper would at once know what she wanted . From some corner of his shop he would produce the merchandise which was exactly what his customer had in mind . Or else he would produce a big surprise , some material or implement which a traveller had only recently offered him . Though , strictly speaking , he had had that particular customer in mind even at the time of buying it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shops in Berlin ? and no doubt the same applied to all European cities ? were still divided into two main categories : the ones where merchandise was weighed ( principally foodstuffs ) and the ones where it was cut ( textiles ) . Only later did the shops arise where goods were sold by number : ironmongery , glassware , fancy goods ? all those things which are covered in France by the term quincaillerie . All that was no longer in line with the splendour of Paris under the second empire . Marshals and generals , senior ministerial officials , the landed nobility , and wealthy manufacturers all wanted luxury . Napoleon III wanted his Court and his people to enjoy riches and splendour . In Lyons Jacquard 's mechanical looms were producing silks in almost inexhaustible quantities . Artists were vying with each other in ever new designs . Everything hinged on the ability to sell ? on bringing the merchandise to the notice of the elegant ladies and on pricing it in such a way that the ordinary womenfolk of the country could snatch for themselves a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much easier to make one 's prudent husband part with his money if one strolled past those magnificent shop-window displays . Behind the large window ? the glass industry had also made much progress ? there was an enchanting new model ; who could resist the temptation ? Visitors came from far afield , attracted by the reputation of the Paris fashions and by the great World Exhibition of 1867 . They came , they saw , they admired , and they imitated ? not only the dressmakers and manufacturers , but also the retailers . Boucicaut 's success swept away all doubts . This , clearly , was the way to handle one 's customers , to compute one 's prices , and to organize one 's sales if one wanted to achieve a big turnover and to make real money . // In America , Macy founded his first department store in New York in 1858 ; Wanamaker followed suit in Philadelphia in 1861 ; Marshall Field came next . In London , the department stores of Harrods , John Lewis , Whiteleys , and Selfridges appeared in 1909 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karstadt in 1881 . Shortly afterwards , three big department stores sprang up in Berlin one after another , all of them in Leipziger Strasse ? Jandorf , Wertheim , and Tietz . All department stores firmly adhered to Boucicaut 's four principles : big turnover , fixed prices , no obligation to buy , and generous exchange . On one occasion a wealthy customer acquired an expensive chandelier at Wertheim 's ; six months later he died . His heirs , having no use for the ostentatious piece , enquired at Wertheim 's whether they would buy back the chandelier at a reduced price . The firm immediately declared themselves ready to reimburse the full purchase price . It was a good advertisement . Advertisement ! That was the secret of this great success . To begin with , the customers had to be lured into the store . For that purpose it needed a continuous succession of new hits , ' articles which went ' because of their exceptionally low price . They might come from a particularly favourable bulk purchase , perhaps from bankrupt stock or from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a buyer might have discovered a new line which was the result of some technical innovation , of a new invention or a new process . A tremendous stir was produced , for instance , by the first sewing machines , and later by the first electric appliances . That was exactly what industry needed . Under the old system of retail trade , when shopkeepers could not afford experiments , it had been impossible to increase sales quickly enough . The public had to be made to buy , and to buy more . Now whatever the machines produced had to be sold . If at first industry had supplied poor-quality articles the quality was now improving from year to year so that , before long , machines were working more efficiently , more cheaply , and often even more durably than the small craftsmen . Besides , the ladies wanted variety . The small shops had called themselves magasins de nouveautes ; Printemps was an even more seductive name . Better still was the name which Emile Zola gave to the department store of his novel , Au Bonheur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the new materials , provided they could be educated to // move with the fashions , and every spring and every autumn to look out for whatever was new on the market , then the manufacturers need worry no longer . From the fashionable capital city with its dazzling shops the new spirit radiated outward , and with it the public 's higher demands and a livelier style of living ? first to the suburbs , to engulf the middle class and the petit-bourgeoisie , then to the provinces , and eventually to the young countries beyond the seas . One day the new fashions would penetrate even to the savages ' ; their demand , too , would be stimulated , and they too would be engulfed by the restless bustle of the industrial age . The department store was the pacemaker of that age . On its vast floors , amid the throng of customers , during the great seasonal sales the fashionable new materials and articles emerged victorious over old habits , over prejudice , over traditional customs which had stubbornly survived until then . The great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport ? tramways and later motor-cars ? brought new groups of customers from the suburbs , from neighbouring villages , and from provincial towns . Technical progress favoured the development of the department store . At first the shopkeepers complained that the department stores were robbing them of their customers by selling rubbish , the cheapest kind of factory-made article , whereas they themselves had to demand appropriately high prices for good craftsmanship ? in other words , they could not even begin to compete . They painted a picture of a ruined middle class . But in actual fact the number of shops increased . In Prussia , for instance , there had been only 97 independent merchants per io , 000 of the population in 1843 ; by 1895 the number had risen to 240 . In Saxony , more highly industrialized , it had risen from 256 to 637 . Fixed prices relieved the owner from serving in his shop himself ; he could now leave most of the selling to his employees and devote himself to organization , calculation , buying , and advertising . From a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guild ? retail trade developed into big business , into a specialized , highly ramified undertaking . The merchandise was artistically displayed in the shop-windows so that every customer could see and choose . Nowadays many retailers owe nearly half their turnover to a well-arranged window display . Even if a customer does not want to buy what she sees in the window , the model , t // displayed may nevertheless induce her to step into the shop and make further enquiries . Once she is inside the greatest obstacle is overcome . So as to lure even the hurrying passer-by into a shop many big firms nowadays build huge arcades with continuous window displays along both sides ; for the sake of this they gladly sacrifice a considerable part of their floorspace even though each square foot costs a great deal of money in the big shopping streets . Once the passer-by feels " inside the shop , " even for a moment , half the battle is won . Thus the second half of the nineteenth century witnessed the rise of the famous shopping streets which attract visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris , Regent Street in London , Leipziger Strasse in Berlin , and the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele in Milan . Industry sees to it that ever new goods are offered for sale and that fashions change . The high rents in the city centre can be met only if turnover increases correspondingly . To increase the price of the individual piece of merchandise , to charge some fabulous figure , does not pay if a customer can buy the same item at a lower price a few yards down the road . An annoyed customer is a customer lost . A merchant must calculate precisely and give the most courteous service to each of his customers . Now the customer is queen . She may stroll from shop-window to shop-window , viewing the luxuries displayed , comparing the pricetickets . She may enter a shop , without any embarrassment , ask for a particular item , inspect a whole mountain of patterns and models ? and walk out again to consider her purchase carefully once more . A shopkeeper must remain polite and obliging ; he must never show his irritation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he has the right material or the pretty little hat she covets , and if its price is competitive . Inwardly a shopkeeper may often groan under the excessive demands of his customers : goods of the most awkward and intractable shape are to be packed up neatly and conveniently , even the smallest package is to be delivered to the customer 's home . But if a merchant does not keep abreast of the times he will lose his customer , for his rival at the next corner makes up very tidy parcels and naturally has everything delivered to a customer 's house . It is a far cry from the days when a housewife would carry home all her shopping in a large basket or when she took jugs and jars with her if she went to the grocers . That kind of thing no longer fits into the elegant boulevards of Paris , // into the affluent streets of the big cities . The paper industry supplies high-quality wrapping-paper , smooth , plain white , or in pastel colours , and pretty string or tape is supplied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precious luxuries , but have now become a matter of course . More and more novelties are stocked in the shops . Only a well-run specialized shop can now carry the thousands of different articles which an exacting customer may demand . And there is no end to those demands . And if a customer is not offered the thing she has asked for she will go straight to one 's competitor . The widest possible range of goods must be carried . Stocks have become the retailer 's nightmare . Anything that is not sold quickly becomes out of date . At first slow selling lines could still be sold without great loss in the provinces because there the fashions were months , if not years , behind Paris . By the time the styles of Paris , London , or Berlin had spread to the provinces they had become passe in the big cities . Boucicaut , however , introduced big sales in Paris itself . The sales of his day were like great battles , with customers fighting furiously over unique bargains . They were occasions no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were dumped ' well below cost price ? some delicious soap , a pretty handkerchief , or a delightful silk remnant . This bait invariably paid for itself ; the delighted customer would take with her so many other things . And , more important still , she would come back regularly . In Boucicaut 's emporium all merchandise was openly displayed , the prices were clearly marked , and the assistants had to do no more than wrap up the goods bought and hand them over to the customer . That kind of selling could be done by any young girl from the country ; she merely had to be taught to be courteous and pleasant to the customer and never to lose her patience . All customers were equal . The servant-girl might rub shoulders with the countess , the charwoman with the wife of the Minister . They all paid good money and were entitled to be treated as customers . A shop 's clientele was composed of thousands and thousands of simple people ; these together would spend far more money than a few highborn ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters , was Boucicaut 's motto , not a high profit margin on an individual article . The main task was to gain a mass clientele , to flatter the // customer and give her courage to enter an exclusive shop filled with elegant ladies . Slowly and laboriously a modern merchant educates his public . Dazzling shop-windows , attractive displays , clearly marked fixed prices , to save a customer the embarrassment of first asking and then being told that the hat in the window , a pair of gloves , or some delightful handkerchiefs are well beyond her reach , and courteous service ? all these have but the single purpose of giving the customer self-assurance . At first the ordinary public fought shy of the elegant shops . They had always been told : these things are not for the likes of you , they are for the quality . ' In modern conditions the art of salesmanship no longer consists of a soft , persuasive voice , of skilful argument , and of countless little psychological tricks of the trained salesman . What matters is that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price , be able to give reliable advice so that a customer buys only what will really give her pleasure ? for then she will return . The old-style small shopkeeper who merely weighed or measured his merchandise had to yield to the properly trained modern shop-assistant , who must be thoroughly acquainted with the goods he sells , be able to answer all questions with lucidity and assurance , and to distinguish between various manufactures and explain the advantages and disadvantages of the one compared with the other . A customer nowadays expects expert advice when he enters a specialized shop . Even the small shopkeeper , until recently looked down upon , gained in esteem and social standing . Respectable citizens at first shook their heads over the showy ' shop at the corner , its big shop-windows and its expensive fittings . Who was going to pay for all that ? The buying public ? Never . The over-ambitious shopkeeper , they thought , was bound to come to grief before long . But they were wrong . Customers came by the dozen , they convinced themselves that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the miserable basement premises they had patronized in the past . In order to cover the overheads of expensive displays the turnover must remain large ? or , more correctly , it must go on increasing all the time . Now and again a retailer might make some suggestions for the benefit of the manufacturer when ordering from the travelling salesman . This idea in itself completely upset the traditional views about the functions of the retailer . The retailer , it used to be held , had to buy his // goods from the wholesaler ; and he would receive credit only so long as he bought hundreds of different lines of articles . Now a retailer would deal directly with the manufacturer , inform him of his wishes , and occasionally give him a tip or two . A manufacturer is always glad of a good idea . In 1882 Oscar Tietz , then 24 , opened a small draper 's and haberdasher 's shop in Gera , with some assistance from his uncle Hermann . He decided to buy his stock straight from the manufacturer . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which also included fixed prices and cash payment , must surely wreck the business in no time . After a mere fortnight uncle Hermann withdrew from the partnership , leaving the business to his reckless nephew . Some years later Oscar Tietz owned 10 department stores , several smaller shops , and a number of industrial works . More recently , Horten had a similar success with his stores in the Rhineland and the Ruhr . A good idea was always worth a fortune . In Utica , in the state of New York , a 27-year-old merchant offered every article in his shop at 5 cents . Every customer could take what he wanted . Surely that idea was bound to work ! But it proved a failure . A distrustful public did not respond , and the shop was forced to close down . During the very same year the young man opened another shop in Lancaster , Pennsylvania , where he offered all articles at 5 or 10 cents . This time it worked . When Frank Winfield Woolworth died in 1919 he left 27,000,000 dollars . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniform-price shops in the United States ; by the middle of the twentieth century their number had risen to 2000 and their turnover to 600,00o,000 dollars . Everything hinges on the art of selling . A great many customers do not like personal service or being harangued by assistants . They know exactly what they want ; they merely cast a quick , expert glance at merchandise and price , and hurry out of the shop again . To meet their demands fruit , vegetables , butter , and cheese are wrapped in weighed quantities marked with the price , ready to take away . Self-service saves time and speeds sales . In 1946 some 60 per cent . of all food sales in the United States were made in self-service stores , compared with only 31 per cent . in 1929 . In chain-stores up to 8o per cent . of all food sales are made in self-service departments , compared with 43 per cent . in the case of independently owned shops . // The retail trade is spending more and more on advertising . Handbills are distributed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertisements , huge posters are put up on hoardings . Articles are extolled and customers lured to the great emporia in the town centres . But is it right that the retail trade should be so concentrated in a few locations ? The answer was provided by the chain-stores . Chain-stores , spread out over a whole town or even a whole country , all stock the same articles at the same prices . A customer should be able to get his cigars , his coffee , or his butter at the next corner without having to make a long journey into town . In the United States there are now about ' too firms whose chain-stores stock only foodstuffs . In 1929 the independently owned shops accounted for 68 per cent . of all food sales against 32 per cent . in chain-stores ; two years later the proportion had changed only slightly in favour of the chain-stores ; it stood then at 66 to 34 per cent . Automatic vending-machines are not tied to shop hours . Day and night these dumb salesmen ' are ready to give service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chocolate industry that first put up such automatic vending-machines at railway stations and other places where large numbers of people passed through . A small coin would buy a sizeable bar of chocolate . The idea conceived by industry was presently adopted by the retail trade . Before the Second World War there were 400,000 automatic vending-machines in Germany . In the United States their number had risen to 2,500,000 by 1946 , with a turnover of 500,00o dollars . Half a century ago Bob Greene , the President of the National Automatic Merchandising Association , accumulated a vast fortune out of the 10-cent pieces which were dropping into his vending-machines day after day and hour after hour . But even automatic vending-machines require careful organization , sound judgment of customers ' demands , likes , and habits , and careful consideration of where the machine is to be located and what it is to be filled with . The machines are not cheap , and can yield profits only if prime investments are written off quickly before technical development renders a machine obsolete . The key to success is buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Germany many food merchants nowadays entrust their buying to a buying co-operative ; this ensures for them the advantages of bulk buying with the corresponding discounts . Each member of such a buying co-operative still remains fully liable . In an ever new variety of forms , commerce is trying to discharge its tasks ? in the American supermarkets , by way of mail-order stores , by buying syndicates . Anyone with a good idea which might increase turnover , attract customers , or save costs can make a fortune . Strolling down our modern brilliantly lit shopping streets it is difficult to think ourselves back to the days of our grandparents or great-grandparents , to the towns with narrow , ill-lit , and badly cobbled streets where shopkeepers sat in stuffy little shops and craftsmen were working in dark basements . It may well be said that the modern city began with Boucicaut . I7 The State takes over Distribution I N MOSCOW 'S RED SQUARE stands the vast department store GUM , its three enormous halls linked by wide light-shafts . Displayed on the counters are rolls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blue , black , and white . There are lamps , chandeliers , radio and television sets , pots and pans , electric irons , buckets and brooms , furniture , typewriters , washing-machines , boots and shoes , hats , silk scarves , toys , apples from Belorussia , grapes from the Black Sea , wine from the Caucasus , champagne from the Crimea , and silks from China . All these are for sale . Wide-eyed with amazement , the peasant women from the Volga and the Tartar herdsmen from Siberia shuffle through the brightly lit rooms . They can hardly believe that they can feast their eyes on everything and choose to their heart 's delight . Even the visitor from Western Europe admires the variety of the goods offered ; the scene , in fact , is much the same as at Boucicaut 's , or at Wertheim 's in Berlin , or at Selfridges in London . In the GUM department store the Soviet citizen is made to feel a customer ? flattered and wooed , the master of his own money , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are carefully preserved : lay-out , service , range of articles . Anybody can choose what he likes , everything is for sale ; there are no restrictions on a customer other than his own purse . And yet a whole world divides the Russian department store from Boucicaut 's or Wertheim 's . GUM is set up by the State . GUM sells , or more correctly distributes , whatever the State supplies . It is , in fact , no more than a small cog in the great distributive machinery . The 359 // purpose of GUM is not so much to induce people to buy as to demonstrate to an astonished world the achievements of the Soviet economic system . Boucicaut 's , Tietz 's , Macy 's , or Selfridges continually bring out tempting new merchandise , for they know that their profit depends on their turnover , and their turnover on their success in attracting customers . GUM , on the other hand , sells only what the Stateowned factories are supplying in accordance with the plan . It has its scheduled range of articles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special effort is made to produce articles of particular appeal to the customer , since for the State authorities there is no such thing as a customer . As if anybody could produce all the things some people might like to have ! They should be satisfied with what there is ! Competition is unknown . State-owned enterprises produce whatever a Five-year Plan or Seven-year Plan prescribes for them . ' Their output goes to the State retail organizations or direct to the GUM department store . They do not have to worry whether a new article will sell . ' Anything leaving the factory gate is as good as sold . The distribution is taken care of by the State apparatus . There are no customers , only standard consumers . ' Even if all visitors to GUM were to pounce on one and the same article , say , some colourful material or a convenient kitchen stove , no one in the store would dream of ordering larger quantities of that article . It would simply be sold out . The assistants would shrug their shoulders and explain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or perhaps next year . After all , a lot of things are in short supply in the vast land of Russia . The people ought to be thankful for all the things they are able to buy . What industry produces is determined not by the customer but by authority ? the State , the Five-year Plan , or the Seven-year Plan . The choice is determined by higher ' considerations than the fancy of the buying public . The socialist development of the country must come first ? defence , heavy industry , hydro-electric power-stations , and the opening up of the vastnesses of Siberia . The State Planning Commission knows what it wants . The consumer is allocated whatever is good for him , whatever he really ' needs . He will have to wait a little ; by the end of the current Seven-year Plan , or quite certainly by that of the next , he will be able to choose from an unlimited abundance of goods , far more even than the pampered customer in America .
