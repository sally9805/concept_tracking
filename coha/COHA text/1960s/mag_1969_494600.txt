NOVEMBER 29 , 1969 medicaid-cum-welfare reform bill ) is an increase in the social security " wage base " from $7800 to $9000 ( Nixon ) or possibly more . If economic motives still stir people , everyone with an income of more than $9cloo should be organizing committees to press for an increase to , say , $.12,000 . But they should not ask brokers or insurance sales ? men to join the committees . The deal is so good that it is in the interest of retirement planners to play it down . Their plans are not wrong or evil , just extremely expensive by comparison . One of the stunning things about the American social security system is that it is somehow associated with the " poor , " or at least the " lower class . " True , we all know we pay social security taxes , and we all know we will get some kind of benefit when we retire . But for the middle classes , and above , there has been a widespread assumption that social security benefits arc bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The assumption is not foolish , based on the current level of benefits received by real live people we all know . But this need not - and probably will not - always be the case . How would $400 a month look , in addition to what ? ever other retirement income one had managed to achieve ? Or $500 ? Or $600 ? There is only one way and this is the point so little understood - to make social security meaningful to the emerging majority of reasonably well-off Americans . That is to raise the wage base . For it is " covered wages " while working ( not total wages ) that determine the monthly retirement benefit . ' The benefit can and will be meaningful if the wage base is raised . That is just a starter . Social security- and this gives the shudders to every seller of retirement plans - has a built-in periodic increase of benefits that have not been earned at all . This is because our society has chosen , quite rightly , to make what amounts to a " cost-of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits of those already retired , every two or three years , by act of Congress . President Nixon has now proposed that this principle be written into law ; but whether it is or not , social security is the only contractual retirement plan that has a practical , even if not yet legal , built-in in ? crease to match inflation . These increases , correctly , are in percentages . But a to percent increase on a $too benefit is only $to . If the benefit is $400 ( which none now is because the wage base is not high enough ) the increase is $40 . It is entirely possible to envisage a benefit of $5oo-boo a month on retirement for a good-earning man now aged 40  - -   - -   and one that will adjust upward after he retires . The upward adjustment will be paid for , in practice , by those who are still working and whose wages are rising . That is already the case with the periodic benefit increases we now have . But once again , this marvelous financial opportuni 15 ty - assuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years is possible only if the wage base is raised . The Administration proposal would move the base , as noted , to $9000 , and then would escalate it thereafter with the rise in the general wage level , just as benefits would automatically be tied to the cost of living . This is already a major improvement - and the life insurance industry has cautioned against it . But if the automatic wage base increase principle is to be adopted , why not start the base from a higher level ? It does no harm to the poor . It is not inflationary , except in the form of a very modest increase in em ? ployers ' costs in paying their share for the now-small portion of their staff that earns more than $9000 . It is " unjust " - if that is the word only to the man who would rather spend $6o this year than have an addi ? tional $240 a year on retirement ; social security , it is proper to point out , is compulsory . This matter of the wage base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may be settled for good before many months are out , certainly if the Nixon-proposed escalation proposal is adopted . One is tempted to cry : " $12,000-a-year men unite ! " Or alternatively , the silent majority might raise its voice . In a commencement address at the University of Rochester in ioti6 , Richard Nixon said : " Woodrow Wilson 's distinction between men of thought and men of action can no longer be made . The man of thought who will not act is ineffective ; the man of action who will not think is dangerous . " William Safire , then as now a Nixon speech writer , recalls that he and Mr. Nixon sweated for hours over that passage . It seemed to Safire that Nixon was insistent that the chosen language say exactly what he meant because it ex ? pressed something very important to him in his esti ? mation of himself . The ' resident considers himself to be a man of thought and action , and he wants and needs to have around him , at his instant call and total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality that he perceives and values in himself . Mr. Nixon evidently believes that he has two such men in the persons of Daniel P. Moynihan and Bryce N. Harlow , former White House assistants who have been retitled " Counsellors to the President " and given Cabinet rank . When the President announced and ex ? plained this and other steps in a reorganization of the White House staff to his assembled Cabinet the other day , he said that Moynihan and Harlow were to be " ministers without portfolio , " in the British style . They were present and , although they profess to have no qualms about their new status and duties , I suspect that they cringed just a little , inwardly , when the President spoke in that way of his new Counsellors . Harlow 's experience in government dates back to 1938 , Moynihan 's to the Kennedy Administration , and they must know that " ministers without portfolio " are likely to find themselves in the unhappy position of corporate vice presidents on detached duty , favored with everything except the authority to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugges ? tion to this effect at the White House brings the re ? sponse that it indicates a basic misunderstanding of the Nixon establishment and of the President who heads it . Maybe so , but both Harlow and Moynihan have a lively awareness of the perils that could await them as Mr. Nixon 's in-house philosophers unless they retain some areas of specific authority . The announcement of the staff reorganization said that Harlow , who has been the Assistant for Congres ? sional Relations , " will continue policy guidance of congressional relations , " and Harlow says for himself that " I am to maintain policy oversight in this area . " Moynihan , hitherto the Assistant for Urban Affairs and executive secretary of the Urban Affairs Council , is to " continue his policy guidance in urban problems . " A new Assistant for Congressional Relations and an Urban Council executive secretary ( but not another Assistant for Urban Affairs ) are to be appointed . They are to be pitied , whoever they turn out to be , they are certain to be overshadowed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field of legislative exper ? tise and Moynihan in the whole sweep of social con ? cerns , will continue to be either the President 's top men or nobodies , and neither is the nobody type . Pt Moynihan is a certified liberal Democrat , the only figure at anywhere near the Nixon peaks who qualifies for that description . He is a thinker , an inno ? vator , a strong advocate of his own views , a witty and passionate man who knows how to please the President with his humor and , one must judge from the favor recently shown him , also knows how to keep his passion within the bounds that Mr. Nixon is prepared to tolerate . A good many of his White House associates and perhaps Moynihan himself regret the imminent departure from the President 's staff of the first and until recently the only Counsellor to the Presi ? dent , Arthur Burns , a conservative economist who is leaving to be chairman of the Federal Reserve Board . A pronounced tension , personal and philosophical , quickly developed between Burns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them it con ? tributed materially to the range and worth of the policy choices that are presented to the President . Bryce Harlow , Moynihan 's fellow Counsellor , is also a deeply conservative man , but not a philosophical conservative in the sense that Arthur Burns is . Har ? low 's conservatism ? and this is said with respect is that of a political technician , valued by the President for ( among other talents ) his skill at spotting what he calls " the land-mines " that may be buried in some otherwise laudable policy proposal or program . His largest or anyhow his most obvious service to Nixon , as it was in times past to Dwight Eisenhower , has been to forewarn the President of possible dangers , of likely and avoidable opposition , and to tailor both the expressions and the content of policy in ways calcu ? lated to avert or minimize the opposition . Consider ? ing the extent of unexpected congressional opposition that Nixon has encountered in matters ranging from his ABM system to the Haynsworth nomination , Har ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been substantially impaired . But it obviously has not been impaired at the White House and with the President , and Harlow 's associates generally ex ? pect him to be more of a cautionary than a creative Counsellor . They also expect him to provide a certain counterpoint to the more adventurous Moynihan . It happens that Harlow stands 5 feet 4 inches , Moynihan 6 feet 5 inches , a circumstance that led a junior Nixon assistant to remark that in any confrontation they will face each other " eyeball to knee-cap . " Moynihan has said that he was freed from detailed responsibilities so that he could be available to Nixon " for counselling of one kind and another on a fairly wide range of subjects . " Harlow has said that his and Moynihan 's concerns as Counsellors may stretch " from here to infinity , in an expanding universe , " and he has included in his own range of possible advice the prob ? lems of Vietnam , world peace , inflation , law and order , and governmental reform . A simpler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fat with both of them , on any subject that may come up , and that his first purpose in granting them their new status and freedom is to have them at hand for that exercise whenever he finds time for it . Never mind that Moyni ? han lately has spent a lot of his time on the road , defending the Administration 's social policies and vision and promising bold advances to come , and that he is going off to Europe in December to encourage joint NATO efforts toward social betterment . I am assured that what Nixon wants from Moynihan is Moynihan , talking in person . " Are we tracking with Pat ? " Nixon asked an assistant after the staff changes were announced . " Where is he ? I want to see him . " The President did , soon afterward , in private and in group meetings , for seven hours straight . White House skeptics ask each other , " Where is Pat ? " in a tone of suspicion that Moynihan is on or headed toward a splendidly upholstered shelf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovative Republicans that he built for the Urban Affairs Council has been dismantled and most of its members have been or soon will be re ? assigned to John Ehrlichman , the recently designated Assistant for Domestic Affairs . Moynihan has permis ? sion to recruit " a couple of youngsters " for a reduced staff of his own , but for major assistance he must look hereafter to the expanded Ehrlichman staff . None of this seems to bother him , and perhaps it should n't , but it bothers some of those among his White House associates who consider that anything that appears to diminish Moynihan diminishes the Administration , A question not discussed at the White House , unless an outsider brings it up , is whether Pat Moynihan can continue to be comfortable with the Nixon who 17 lets Vice President Spiro T. Agnew speak for him and the Administration in the current Agnew way . Agnew 's call to the mob and that is what it is for support of the President in Vietnam and , by extension , in do ? mestic matters as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nixon White House . There is , at this writing , no indication that it does , except in the most minor fashion . Moynihan said on November 17 that the Agnew line does not disturb him . He expects to be around as long as he finds him ? self free to speak his mind to the President as he has been up to now , and free also to speak for the Admin ? istration in his own field of social equity . That is where Pat is . I am nut as confident as Moynihan professes to be , that he will be there indefinitely . The House has passed and the Senate is now consider ? ing a tax bill , more than one-fourth of which is devoted to hamstringing the private foundations ? restricting the kinds of grants they can make , taxing their income , and limiting their lifespan ? all in the name of reform . The tax and the limiting of a foundation 's life to 4o years ( a new provision in the Senate bill ) concern pri ? marily the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence and which see in a 7.5 per ? cent , or any , tax on investment income a diminution of resources otherwise available to philanthropy . But the most destructive provisions of the bill ? those of most concern to the small , innovative foundations ? are those forbidding foundations to subsidize controversial projects . Both Senate and House would prohibit lobby ? ing , electioneering , and define narrowly who will be eligible to receive grants . The intent , unstated , is to keep foundations and their grantees out of projects that in the end might come back to haunt Congress in the form of proposed legislation or criticism , Foundations have come in for plenty of legitimate criticism of specific and occasional abuse of their privi ? leged tax status ? politically partisan and nepotistic grants , attempts to influence legislation by prompting letter writing campaigns and such . But present laws , if enforced , would be adequate to deal with these in ? fractions . The new legislation does not go beyond cur ? rent law in effectively controlling the real abuses .
