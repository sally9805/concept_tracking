E t spring a brutal double murder sent a shock wave of revulsion and fear through the little town of Mountain Home , Idaho , 44 miles southeast of Boise . On the night of April 9 someone stabbed and slashed to death Nancy Johnson , the pretty young wife of Airman Alec Johnson , and their two-year-old son Danny . The bodies were found in the kitchen of the modest Johnson home by Alec Johnson early in the morning of April 10 , when he returned home from Mountain Home Air Force Base , 10 miles from the town . What heightened the fear and outrage of Mountain Home was that the double murder seemed wanton and pointless . Nancy had been stabbed viciously more than a dozen times , once with such force that one of her ribs was broken , and her small son 's throat had been cut . Police examination showed that the little home had been ransacked of some odds and ends of almost no value  --  a saw , a hatchet , a hammer , the base of an old lamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars . Police immediately surmised that the burglary had been a hasty afterthought of the killer and not his motive for the crime . Nancy Johnson 's reputation deepened the mystery . She was a pleasant girl without any known enemies , a good wife to Alec Johnson , and highly unlikely to strike up any clandestine affair that might erupt into a crime of passion . There were few clues at the murder scene . What proved to be the most important single piece of evidence was not a clue but the absence of one . There was no murder weapon . Whatever instrument the killer had used , he apparently had taken it with him when he fled . Mountain Home is a raw little " bedroom city " for the huge Strategic Air Command base . Growth of the air base in recent years has spawned acres of trailer homes in the town , pushing its population from 1,887 in 1950 to more than 11,000 . Most of these new thousands are the lonely wives and children of men at the air base . News of the murders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stirred anxiety among the men at the base . The tension also put pressure on the law authorities to solve the two hideous killings . In less than 48 hours the civil authorities came up with a suspect . When his identity was made public a week later , the rank and file at the air base was stunned . He was a fellow airman and a friend and neighbor of the Johnsons  --  a slight , gaunt-faced , 25-year-old Californian , Airman I/C Gerald Martin Anderson . Anderson and his attractive young wife Jane had three children , and the Andersons and Johnsons frequentlybaby-sat for each other and picnicked and fished together . The rented home of the Andersons was scarcely 100 yards from the Johnson residence , where Nancy and little Danny had been killed . Airman Anderson came under suspicion through some tenuous evidence , if it can be called evidence at all . In fairness to the law officers , Anderson was certainly a proper subject for questioning . He was the last person known to have seen Nancy and Danny Johnson alive , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the crime . The time of the murders was estimated roughly between eight P.M. and eleven P.M. At approximately eight P.m . Airman Anderson had left his home to drive to a nearby dairy for two gallons of milk , one for his family and one for the Johnsons . By his account , he had walked over to the Johnson home first and picked up art empty milk jar from Nancy . He had found her alone with Danny , getting the child ready for bed ; Airman Johnson was out at the air base , celebrating the news of his impending transfer to Spain . Anderson said he was in the Johnson home only a couple of minutes , that he had bummed a cigarette from Nancy and that he was still smoking it when he got the jars filled at the dairy , approximately two blocks away . He said that he had then delivered the milk to Nancy and talked briefly to her . She had given him two cans of condensed milk that she owed his wife , Anderson said , and he had then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home firmly at 8:25 P.m. because he recalled in detail the windup of the television program M19-Squad , which finished at 8:30 . Anderson said that he and Jane had then watched the two-hour Academy Award show and had gone to bed at about 10:45 without leaving the house again . At one a.m. they were awakened by Airman Johnson pounding frantically on their window . They let him in and he cried , " Nancy 's over there all cut up and dead , and I ca n't find Danny . Get the police . " Later it turned out that in his anguish he overlooked the body of his son , lying alongside that of his wife , half concealed by their washing machine . Anderson threw on some clothes and drove to the police station , where the woman dispatcher summoned a squad car . Anderson rode with the police to the Johnson home . Then occurred the first of the series of events that soon were to weave a monstrous web around Airman Anderson . He knew that there was only one usable entrance to the Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front door was nailed shut . Anderson insists that he saidsomething to the effect , " Around in back . " The officers , reconstructing the conversation later , reported that he said , " The bodies arc around in back . " The day after the murders Airman Anderson foolishly wove a few more strands of the web of suspicion around himself . He stayed home from the base , and shortly before noon he went downtown and got drunk . Anderson is strictly a beer drinker , with a limited capacity , and after a few beers he began to talk almost compulsively about the murders . " The murders were big news , " he said later . " Since I was the guy who called the police and all , I figured I 'd be the center of attention . " Airman Anderson became the center of attention in a way he had not expected . He talked at length at the Cozy Bar to a married couple . They told the police later that they had driven Airman Anderson home from the bar and that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon his arrival . They said that Anderson had broken down and sobbed , " I did n't want to do it , but I had to , " and that Jane had comforted him and replied , " Shhhh , do n't say another word . " " Heck , I was just talking about going into town and getting beered up , " Anderson says now . " Jane does n't like for me to drink , and I went under false pretenses , telling her I was going to get some Pepsi . And I bawled because when we drove up I looked over at the Johnson home and I got thinking about those terrible murders . 1 felt sorry for Nancy and Danny , and I thought how it might easily have been Jane and my kids . " A touch out of Kafka But when this ambiguous statement ? " I did n't want to do it , but I had to " ? was relayed to Mountain Home officials , they decided Airman Anderson had better be questioned . They asked air-base officials to question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is apparent from what ensued that no one at this time considered Airman Anderson a serious suspect . The Air Police merely called into town and left word for him to drop around the next day when he reported for duty at the base . Anderson dutifully showed up at the Air Police office the following day , April I I. In an ironic touch straight out of Kafka , Airman Anderson walked into the murder interrogation expecting , with considerable apprehension , to get " chewed out " over having allowed the insurance on his car to lapse . Instead , the Air Police began questioning him about his movements the night of the Johnson murder . The questioningwent on through the day and into the evening ; as it ground on and on , Anderson 's apprehension began to mount . Then at nine p.m. the Air Police summoned two plainclothes agents of the Office of Special Investigations . They took him outside while they carried out a thorough , silent shakedown of his car , even carefully sweeping up the dirt from the floor into envelopes and turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spot of blood on the upholstery , " one of the agents said to Anderson , " How did it get there ? ' With that question , Airman Anderson panicked . Long before , he had been out with his wife and in an argument had slapped her , starting a nosebleed . He was ashamed of what he had done and saw no reason why he had to disclose a private family quarrel to the OSI agents . " It 's an old spot , " he told the agent truthfully . " How did it get there ? " the agent persisted . " It was there when I got the car . " Anderson said . This was a lie with a simple motive that could be easily explained and easily understood , but it was to swell to nightmare proportions in the days to come . " Come with us , " the agents said . They took him across the base to the OSI headquarters and into their crude , bare-looking interrogation room . It was a deceptive little room , because it actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall was a microphone , leading to a tape recorder in an adjoining room . On the wall was what appeared to be a mirror . It was actually a one-way window , from which a hidden agent in the tape-recording room could look out unseen upon what was said and done in the interrogation room . Thus began the ordeal of Airman Gerald Martin Anderson , In the next five days he was grilled for more than 40 hours by relays of OSI agents until finally , exhausted , confused and his will broken , he signed a statement that he had killed Nancy Johnson . It is a statement that was not written by Airman Anderson nor even dictated by him . It is a statement that left the murder of little Danny Johnson totally unexplained . It embodies incriminating statements that Anderson consistently denied up to the moment of signature and that he promptly repudiated when he got out of the hands of the OSI . It is a confession that is bare of many vital details of the crime and is almost totally lacking in corroboration by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confession that failed to convince one or the interrogating OSI agents that Airman Anderson had actually committed the crime . . 64 The interrogation of a crime suspect , if conducted with proper responsibility , is a delicate art . Guilty persons do not usually sit down with an officer and say , " All right , I did it , and here 's the story . " They are brought to that point by a variety of psychological pressures . These pressures have been developed over the years in thousands of interrogations and have been reduced to a technique that can be taught in a classroom , like basket weaving or any other special skill . Haunting every interrogation of a suspect is the danger of inducing a " confession " of guilt from an innocent person . Free societies accordingly have always hedged the interrogation process with restraints . These include limitations on the length of time a man may be questioned before he is charged with a crime , the right of access to legal counsel and the prohibition against requiring a person to testify against himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is tacit concession to a profound truth  --  that given unrestrained access to a suspect , skilled inquisitors can eventually get him to admit almost anything . For an interrogation to produce a false confession does not require that the interrogators set out deliberately to railroad an innocent man . Justice can miscarry in a much more subtle fashion . Law officers can become convinced that a subject is guilty and then set about breaking down his defenses ; in the belief that they are cracking a strong-willed person who is guilty they may unwittingly crumple the inadequate defenses of a weaker person who is innocent . Anderson was grilled by four agents working in shifts . Three were from the regular OSI force at the base ; the fourth , Joe Townsend , was a lie-detector operator flown in from Lowry A FR in Denver , regional headquarters of the OSI . The first inquisitor was William Welsch , head of the Mountain Home OSI detachment . He began the questioning in a friendly , relaxed manner . He read Anderson Article 31 of the Military Code  --  the counterpart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through : ' he told the airman . ' ' Generally what it means is that you do n't have to make any statement , and any statement made by you can be used in evidence against you . " " Anything I would say would n't hurt me ? " Anderson asked him . Welsch avoided answering the question and moved easily into his questioning . With the hidden tape machine recording every word , he told Anderson , " You understand that everything we say here is between you and me . In other words , the only thing , I just want to shoot the bull and get a little background from you .... " They talked about Anderson 's early life , his parents , hisschooling , his religion , how he joined the service , his marriage . In this easygoing little chat , the OSI picked up four pieces of information . Anderson told Welsch the truth about the blood on his car , that it was from Jane 's nosebleed when he slapped her , He related that he had been in trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . He told the agent that he had once got into a fight with his wife 's stepfather , who had moved in on them without paying his own way . And he volunteered that when he was a boy he had fallen at a skating rink , struck his head , and had blacked out from the blow . When he mentioned the juvenile trouble that had sent him to the reform school , he told Welsch that he would rather not talk about it because " it 's all past and done with , and I 'd just as soon not bring it up . " Welsch , all geniality , replied , " Surely , " and passed over the incident . But he promptly relayed it to the next interrogator for his own use against Anderson . Welsch led Anderson around to the day of the murders . By now the airman , who already had related his account to the Air Police , was groggy with fatigue , but he ran through his story again in detail . When he finished , he let out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the agent . " When are we going to call it quits there , podner ? Boy , 1 tell you , I 'm getting sleepy . " This complaint revealed much about Airman Gerald Anderson . Legally he was not in custody and could have got up and walked out of the interrogation room without asking the agent 's permission . But Anderson has a passive personality and an awesome respect for authority . The transcript shows , too , that at this point he was eager to assist the OSI ; he repeatedly stated that he wanted " to help you fellows . " Welsch ignored his complaint of fatigue and led him again over the events after he had left the Johnson home after delivering the milk to Nancy . Then without warning Welsch threw a frightening question at the young airman . " Why did you get rid of those two people ? " the agent demanded . " I beg your pardon ? " Anderson said . " 1 said , " repeated Welsch , " Why did you get rid of those two people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Anderson asked . " Nancy and Danny . " " You 're out of your mind ! " said Airman Anderson . Welsch withdrew from the questioning and was replaced by another agent . Robert Jent . He started up where Welsch left off , with the unexplained and unsupported assumption that Anderson was guilty of the two killings . One of the basic techniques of procuring confessions is to give the suspect a way to admit guilt and still save face . The agent began opening a path for Anderson to confess the hideous killings and still save some remnant of self-respect . The agent told Anderson that " due to environment , due to illnesses , due to many reasons , people do n't follow the straight and narrow path .... Sometimes we ca n't help what we do . Sometimes we do things in a moment of passion , a moment of anger and maybe because things just are n't clicking off right up here in our head . Normal human beings want to get things straightened out , where we know we have done wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't know . " His composure cracked When Anderson clung to his insistence that he had done nothing to the John-sons , the agent turned the questioning to the juvenile incident that Welsch had graciously passed over . He demanded to know what kind of " trouble " Anderson had been in . Anderson resisted him , insisting that it had nothing to do with the investigation . When the agent continued to press him relentlessly , Anderson 's composure cracked slightly for the first time . " Ca n't I have somebody in here with me ? " he asked the agent . The legally correct answer to this question was " Yes . " Under Article 31 of the Military Code , Anderson was entitled to the advice of a lawyer , either a civilian attorney , if he wanted to pay for one , or free counsel from the air base legal office . This office , ironically , was next door to the interrogation room . " You 've got to stand on your own two feet , " the agent told him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conic out . Something like this there is no stopping . This investigation can go on for years and years . . . . We 're going to check out everything , every stinking thing that happened to you .... We 're going to stop nowhere until this matter is solved . " Reluctantly , Anderson toad him that he had been involved in a minor sex offense . It had stemmed from adolescent curiosity ; the girl had not been harmed : the offense had never been repeated , and Anderson said he had felt an enduring sense of gu i It and shame about it ever since . The agent told Anderson that some of the people at the base had been saying for a year that he was " mentally off " on certain things , psychologically speaking . Anderson bristled at this accusation . " Like what ? " he challenged the agent . " Well , I 'm not going to sit here and you and tell you exactly , be-cause I do n't know exactly . I just know that ... it 's all putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anderson on the incident when he had returned home from the Cozy Bar the day after the murders and had broken down when he met his wife . Then he went back to Anderson 's " lie " about the blood on his car and began upbraiding the airman . " I think you 're a psychopathic liar , " the OSI man told Jerry Anderson . " That 's what l think you are . I think you 're sick . You 're sick whether you admit it to yourself or not . You 're sick in the head . When are you going to admit that you need help ? ... The only way you are going to get help is by coming clean and asking for forgiveness for what you 've done , and you 're never going to do it by sitting there telling me little piddly ? lies .... have told lies when the truth would have served the same purpose . Why ? What are you trying to hide ' ? " " I 've told you the truth . " " You have lied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me another lie by telling me you told the truth ... . You 're a sick man .... You are a man of violence . You know you are . Will you say it to yourself ? Will you admit to yourself that you are n't quite right ? Huh ? " " There is n't anything wrong , " Anderson insisted . " There you go again , " snapped the agent . " You 're a sick man that took the life of that young mother and little boy . It could happen again . It could happen to your own family .... Where is it going to lead ? Where is the next bit of violence going to be ? " , " Sir , " said Airman Anderson , " I did n't do it . " " You do n't know you did n't do it because you do n't know what the truth is . We have already established that you do n't know what the truth is .... Is your conscience something that left you many years ago , huh ? , . , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I did n't do it , I tell you . " " I 'm not going to leave you alone until 1 get the truth out of you .... Now we will stay here until tomorrow night at this time .. . until I get the truth . .. . You 're a sick man . You 're sick . Did you ever think about that ? You 're sick . You 're a twisted up , violent , sick man . That 's what you are . Look at yourself . Inspect your heart , inspect your mind , look at your brain .... Are you proud of what you are , huh ? " Throughout this sustained assault on his personality , Airman Anderson responded with unbroken denials . Early in the morning the agent gave up . Between the Air Police and the OSI , Anderson had been under interrogation for over 15 hours . Now they moved in a fresh agent , a smooth-checked , boyish fellow , David Marigold , with a soft voice and a sympathetic manner . Mangold was only 23 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of 18 months with the OSI , and his total training in criminal investigation consisted of a 10-week course at the OS.1 school in Washington . He had never before investigated a homicide . One of the established techniques of interrogation is the " good guy and bad guy " ploy . This consists of alternating harsh , aggressive , hostile agents with a gentle and sympathetic one . The psychology is to build up bitter resentment of the " bad guy " agent and then give the suspect an understanding audience in the form of a ' ' good guy " agent . Suspects on the verge of confessing often pour out their admissions to the " good guy " just to " show up " the inadequacies of the " bad guys " as interrogators . " Now I do n't know what your trouble has been with Mr. Welsch or Mr. Jent , and I do n't care , " he said . " All I 'm interested in is what you 're going to tell me , and I 'd like to hear it , hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me , Jerry ? " " No more , " mumbled the exhausted Anderson . " No more . " " Just one more , huh ? " Mangold wheedled . In a remarkable display of endurance , the exhausted airman outlasted the fresh young agent . Near dawn Anderson was stubbornly maintaining his innocence , and the exasperated Mangold suddenly broke and abandoned his assigned role of the sympathetic " good guy . " " If you 're afraid of getting in any deeper , you need n't have any worries , " he told Anderson , " because you 're at the bottom of the well , man , and they 're getting ready to put the plug in over you . . . I want you to get it off your chest , and do n't give me any of this because I 've had it . You know the answers . . . If a man had nothing to hide , he 'd come out with these answers .... You are the type of man that hits his own wife . 1 do n't hold with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think he 's the lowest son of a bitch on the face of the earth . " At dawn they led Anderson over to the detention facility and let him go to bed . Although he was under no detaining order and had been charged with no crime , he did not question their right to lock him up . He turned in just as everyone else was getting up for the new day . " They were banging around , going in and out , cleaning the place , with the radio going , " Anderson recalls . " I did n't get much sleep . " A specialist on lying The next day they brought in Joe Townsend and his lie detector . The OSI built up Townsend and his " lie box " in advance to Airman Anderson , conditioning him to the belief that the machine was infallible . " This man 's a specialist , " Agent Welsch told Anderson . " I have never known him to be wrong , and if a man is lying he can tell it . " Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it worked and told him , " Fa person tells me the truth , I know it . If he does n't tell me the truth , I know it . " " Well , I 'm pretty sure I 'll pass it , ' ' Anderson said . - No , there is no pretty sure about it , " Townsend told him . " You know right now whether you will or not ... because you know right now whether you did commit this act . If you did n't , there is no way in the world that I 'm going to show that you did . " This is a gross misstatement of the capabilities of the polygraph machine . The lie detector is a useful tool , but it is not an omniscient judge . The readings obtained from it are not admissible in court as evidence of guilt . Capable operators readily concede that reactions on the " box " require human interpretation , that there are guilty suspects who can " beat the box " and that there arc circumstances where innocent people will yield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tests on Airman Anderson . By his own account , he got a completely contradictory set of readings . The first tests produced reactions that Townsend interpreted as guilty knowledge of the murders and of the murder weapon . He then tested Anderson specifically on the nature of the weapon and what he had done with it , because at this time the weapon  --  a major piece of evidence  --  was still missing . Townsend got a complete negative from Airman Anderson , both on the weapon and its whereabouts . Baffled , the lie-detector operator ran flee tests on the airman . All showed no knowledge of what was used to kill the Johnsons or what had been done with the weapon . In the face of these contradictory readings and despite clear indication that Anderson showed negative on key aspects of the crime , Townsend informed the airman that he had failed the lie test . Abandoning his role as polygraph technician , Townsend took over as interrogator , and in the next three days he grilled Anderson for 27 hours . The transcript of the grilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young airman . To his continued protests of his innocence , Townsend simply insisted , " We 've already crossed that bridge , and there 's no going back . . . We both know it happened , and you and I are the only two that know for certain it happened . " Townsend now began pressing Anderson for the motive . He suggested to Anderson repeatedly that perhaps he was insane , or that he had blacked out and killed the Johnsons without knowing it . " You can say that you were completely off your rocker , " Townsend told him . " Neither myself nor anybody could prove that you were n't momentarily insane for a period of ten minutes . " " I swear to God I did n't do it , " Anderson replied , but by now his protestations were becoming more and more uncertain . He began to discuss with the agent , on a " just suppose " basis , that maybe he had blacked out . Under the hammering of accusation his memory 01 " the night of April 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the first time , he told the inquisitors that now he could not clearly recall his actions after delivering the milk to Nancy Johnson " I ca n't remember leaving her house , " he said . The agents seized on this and began pushing the idea that he had killed the mother and son without his conscious mind admitting that he had done so . Anderson began to entertain this frightful possibility . " The first couple of days there was no doubt in my mind , " he told the agents . " And then I started talking to you people and your questioning me , and I began to wonder myself , because nothing is impossible . 1 could have blacked out , and I ca n't remember doing it .... " On April 16 , in the middle of the night after five days of interrogation , Airman Anderson 's will finally broke . What broke it , by his account , was a statement by 051 Agent Joe Townsend . Townsend told him that his wife Jane had been interrogated and had incriminated him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this statement . In an interview with the Los Angeles Times she stated , " There could n't be anything of the sort . l do n't know what Townsend was talking about . " Anderson frantically pleaded with the OSI men to let him talk to his wife . Shaken by the lie-detector tests and the constant suggestions that he had killed in a " blackout , " his belief in his innocence began to crack at its foundation with the claim that his wife thought him guilty . The final shove over the brink , Anderson says , came when Townsend threatened to name Anderson 's wife as an accessory . " And when I do that , I put those three young kids in a reformatory or an orphanage , " the agent said . The " confession " of Airman Anderson is surely one of the most peculiar documents in modern criminology . At no point in the marathon interrogation did he state that he had killed either Nancy or Danny Johnson . When his will to resist shattered , he asked the OSI agent to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed them . Townsend unhesitatingly reconstructed the crime for him , and it is Townsend 's version of the murders that is set forth in Anderson 's confession . After explaining to Airman Anderson how he might have killed Nancy , and why , Townsend summoned young Mangold and began dictating a confession as if it were being made by Anderson . " Townsend did all the talking , Mangold did all the writing , and I did all the listening , " Anderson says . The tape recorder clearly shows that Townsend spoke to Anderson only sporadically throughout the dictation , to check a few minor details . On the key passages that relate the murder , Anderson sat silent while Townsend and Mangold composed his " confession . " The statement sets forth that when Anderson brought the milk jar back from the dairy , he made a verbal pass at Nancy , and she rebuffed him with a slighting reference to his manhood . " This 66 remark of Nancy 's enraged me , " Townsend dictated . " I immediately became violent . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : however , I am not certain . I recall seeing some blood on the Hoor and know that I did stab her , but I do not know what knife or instrument 1 used to stab her , and 1 have no idea where the instrument is now . During this short period it seemed to me that I blacked out , and I do not recall seeing or doing any harm to Johnson 's son Danny . " The tape recording carries a revealing dialogue between Townsend , Anderson and Mangold near the end of the dic-tation : TOWNSEND : " My wife and I remained awake early in the morning after the murders and discussed the-what  --  incident  --  or ? " ANDERSON : " Whatever you want to call it . " TOWNSEND : " The murderorstabbing ? " M ANGOLD : " Call it the murder or stabbing . " TOWNSEND : " Happenings at Johnson 's home . We 'll just let them draw their own cotton-picking conclusions . " In dictating Anderson 's " confession , " Townsend changed the time that the airman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement puts the time at 8:35 P.M. Throughout the interrogation , Anderson had clung stubbornly to one fact  --  that he had arrived home before 8:30 , in time to watch the conclusion of Al-Squad , which he recalled vividly and in detail . One can only speculate at the reason for this alteration in time , but Townsend 's reconstruction of the crime gives a clue . Independent testimony had placed Anderson at the dairy after eight P.M. The murder scene was violently splashed with blood . With Anderson leaving the dairy after eight P.M. , it would have been virtually impossible for him to have driven to the Johnson home , delivered the milk , talked to Nancy , become enraged , killed her and the boy , washed up the blood on him , looted the house , and disposed of the murder weapon in time to get home and sit down to a television program by 8:25 . The statement presented to Anderson for signature conveniently gave him an extra 10 minutes to get all this done . When Marigold finished his writing , the agents swore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared . In a final burst of resistance , he threw down the pen and refused to sign it . " I want to know one thing , Joe , " he appealed to Townsend . " Did my wife really say f did it ? . I 'm so mixed up do n't know what I want to do , ? My wife really said I did it , huh ? " Townsend assured him that this was the truth . they swore him in again , and this time he affixed his name to the OS I 's version of the death of Nancy Johnson . They had him initial each page and each of Marigold 's corrections in the manuscript . When the tape recording of the event is timed , from the moment he began initialing the six pages until he signed the last one , only 45 seconds elapsed . " Well , that 's it , " said Joe Townsend . " 1 thank you for your cooperation . " When they led Airman Gerald Anderson off , he asked what proved to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " when lie confesses to something he did n't do  --  and then they find out that someone else did it ? " Even then the ordeal of interrogation was not over . The civil authorities in Mountain Home examined his " confession " and pointed out a glaring inadequacy . The autopsy of Nancy Johnson had shown that she had been sexually violated . The statement dictated by OSI agent Townsend had not touched upon this aspect of the murder . The OSI agents hauled Airman Anderson back in and tried to plug this gap in another long inquisition . But by now Airman Anderson was through cooperating . He fought off every suggestion that , in addition to killing his friend and neighbor , he also had raped her . 11 was during this last interrogation that OSI agent lent sickened with the affair and asked to be relieved of questioning Anderson further . " I felt in my mind , " he said later , " that he was n't the man . " Murder weapon is found The Air Force turned Anderson over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 , just nine days after the murders in Mountain Home , Later in the same day , searchers found the weapon that had killed Nancy and Danny Johnson . It was discovered on the roadside more than a mile from the murder scene , a fact that ripped a hole right through Joe Townsend 's tight time schedule for the murder of Nancy Johnson . But by now the OSI had finished its job , and there were other investigations to be pursued . No one bothered trying to fit the task of disposing of the knife , with a two-mile round trip , into Airman Anderson 's " confession . " Seven months later , with Anderson sitting in the Elmore County Jail , charged with the murder of Nancy Johnson , the case blew wide open . In the middle of November a 21-year-old civilian named Theodore Dickie confessed to the killings . Unlike Airman Anderson , Dickie confessed of his own volition , with no interrogation , reconstruction or suggestions from anyone . Unlike Airman Anderson , he supplied details of the murder that not even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted the murders , Dickie was being held in Ada County Jail in Boise for the slaying of a 10-year-old girl , to which he had already confessed . The civilian officials , aware of the danger that Dickie , facing one murder charge , might falsely confess another crime , put Dickie 's account to the severest possible test , They found an impressing array of corroboration in the accumulated evidence in the Johnson murders . The most damning point of verification , virtually riveting Dickie to the crime , concerned the murder weapon . Dickie stated that he had killed the Johnsons with an old hunting knife and that the blade had broken when he stabbed Nancy . In the autopsy of Nancy Johnson , a moon-shaped piece of a knife blade was found inside her chest . When the murder weapon was found at the roadside  --  the weapon Townsend 's " lie box " showed Airman Anderson had no knowledge of  --  the blade had a moon-shaped gap in it . FBI tests proved that the piece in Nancy 's body came from Dickie 's knife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knife , he also told them something they did n't know  --  where the knife had come from . He said he had stolen it shortly before the murder from a trading post in Mountain Home . Queried by officers after Dickie 's confession , the owner of the knife confirmed that it had been stolen from him , described it accurately and , when shown the weapon , identified it as stolen from his store in April . Dickie named the articles he had stolen from the Johnson home , accurately described the two purses and their contents and told where he had thrown them . He described the interior of the Johnson home in detail , down to the location of a shotgun shell on the tOP of the television set , and the position of Il a baseball bat on the rear porch . He described how Nancy Johnson was dressed and stated that he had had sex relations with her . He stated that shortly before going to the Johnson house his car stalled in Mountain Home and he had got a push from a resident . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplied a motive for the crime ; he said that he had got into a violent argument with Nancy Johnson , and she had rushed into the kitchen and got a knife , and that lie had knocked her down and stabbed her , and then killed Danny when the child came in and began crying . When the last lead in Dickie 's story had been checked and verified , the Idaho civilian authorities moved swiftly to rectify Airman Anderson 's plight . The prosecuting attorney of Elmore County moved to dismiss the murder charge against Anderson , declaring that " evidence has now been discovered which completely exonerates the defendant " and informing the court that " an investigation of the facts has revealed physical evidence in full corroboration of the confession ... of Theodore Thomas Dickie . " In a highly unusual action , the district judge entered an order that Anderson was " adjudged and decreed . . . not guilty " of the Johnson murder and that the prosecution be dropped and Anderson released . With a known slayer confessing the Johnson crime and a court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his long agony had come to an end . After seven months of sitting in a cell for a murder another had now confessed , Anderson was released and reunited with his wife . He told newsmen that " it 's wonderful , just wonderful . I knew I did n't commit this crime , and I just waited , hoped and prayed for some break . " The Air Force 's ordeal What seemed a storybook ending to a tragedy of errors was shattered within 24 hours . While Airman Anderson celebrated the end of his ordeal , the Air Force was suffering through an ordeal of its own . To drop the charge against Anderson would be public admission that the OSI had obtained a fraudulent confession . To resolve this dilemma , the Air Force flew in a legal expert from March Air Force Base in California . It announced that Anderson would be held in custody for 24 hours , while the expert reviewed the entire case and recommended a course of action , On the basis of his one-day examination of the long , involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 300 pages  --  the Air Force on November 27 charged Airman Anderson with the murders of both Nancy and Danny Johnson . Back went Airman Anderson behind military bars . The announcement set a storm of controversy swirling around Mountain Home Air Force Base . Idaho newspapers raised a cry that the military was flouting the civilian courts . The Idaho Shdesmatt charged that the Air Force was operating under a law of its own . Senator Thomas Kuchel of Anderson 's home state of California requested an inquiry by Congress . Investigations of the case were begun by the Department of Justice , the Inspector General 's Office , the Defense Department and the Senate Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights . Amid the uproar a select team of OSI agents came swarming into Mountain Home and Boise . Early in December the Air Force convened an " Article 32 " hearing  --  the military equivalent of a grand jury  --  to determine whether Airman Anderson should be sent to court-martial or cleared of the killings . A weeklong hearing , conducted by Maj. James Goddard of the Judge Advocate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensations in to case . Under bitter cross-examination by Anderson 's civilian attorney , Robert McLaughlin , and by his military attorney , Maj. Peter McKinney , testimony was produced that : 1 . OSI agents , on learning that Dickie had confessed to the crime their men had pinned on Anderson , had subjected Dickie to a lengthy interrogation . Although he told them from the outset that he had killed the Johnsons , OSI agents had continued to interrogate him until he gave them an oral repudiation of his confession . ( As soon as the OSI agents left town again , Dickie called in newsmen and said , " I just gave the OSI a big old spiel. knew what they wanted  --  to tie Anderson into that crime , and I told them what they wanted to hear . " He then reaffirmed his original confession. ) 2 . The OSI agents who obtained Anderson 's " confession " ignored his requests for legal counsel and neglected to enter these requests in their records , in violation of OSI regulations . 3 . Townsend , the agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put his children in an orphanage , swore that he did not consider this " coercion . " 4 . Townsend also stated his belief that accusing a suspect of murder , suggesting to him that he was mentally unsound and might have killed in a blackout , and then running a lie-detector test on him would not affect the polygraph readings . 5 . Laboratory tests of the material " shaken down " from Anderson 's car had shown no connection with the crime . 6 . Male skin and hair samples scraped from Nancy Johnson 's fingernails and body had already proved , under analysis , not to be Airman Anderson 's . At the conclusion of the hearings , Major Goddard announced that he would study the entire record and then recommend to the commander of the 15th Air Force either the release or the court-martialing of Airman Anderson . On January 9Theodore Dickieshattered the remnants of the OS1 's case against Anderson whcn he gave a detailed confession  --  his sixth  --  to OS1 agents and then took , and passed , their lie-detector test . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a final decision until February 7 . And so Airman Anderson still sits in his cell at Mountain Home Air Force Base , waiting for the red tape to unwind . While his ordeal is not yet over , it has toughened and matured him and restored his faith in ultimate justice . After nine months behind bars he still can say , " The Air Force is a good outfit to be in . It 's got some good people and 1 wo n't run it down . " Then he turns his memory back to the long nights he spent in the bare little interrogation room . " Just one thing , " says Airman Gerald Anderson . " What I say about the Air Force does n't go for the OSI. "
