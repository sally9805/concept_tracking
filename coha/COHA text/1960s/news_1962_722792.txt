txt An antitrust trial Which auto men believe could have a shattering impact on the way new cars are sold begins today in Federal district court in Los Angeles . Basically , the case will decide , whether General Motors Corp. , three Southern Callfornia Chevrolet dealer associations and four Chevrolet officials Illegally conspired to bring pressure on Chevy dealers to stop them from selling new cars to discount dealers . The Government charges the defendants " Induced and persuaded " the Chevy dealers to stop their sales to the discount houses . All of the defendants have denied the charges and GM contends it only " expressed its views to all its dealers on the undesirability of selling through discount houses . " The case apparently will revolve around the difference between " expressing views " and " Inducing and persuading . " But legal points aside , many auto people are worried about the case for a more basic reason : They believe that if GM loses , no matter on what grounds , it will mean a great upsurge in discount auto houses and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denies its suit threatens the franchise system ; a Justice Department official says " the indictment seeks only to see that unlawful concerted action is not used to suppress this form ( discount houses ) of merchandising . " Franchised Dealer vs . Discounter To understand what this fight 1.4 all about . one must compare the operations of franchised auto dealers with those of the discounters . ? The franchised new car dealer is an independent businessman who has signed a contract with one of the five major auto manufacturers to represent it In a particular area . He 's the one who has , for instance , a Buick sign over his door and sells only Buicks , or , in some/areas , he may have a dual franchise and sell , say , Ramblers , made by American Motors Corp. , . and Oldsmobiles , made by GM . In any case he 's been directly licensed by the manufacturer to sell its product . There are 31,000 franchised deniers in the . U.S. and some invest as much as $500,000 in their facilities . Franchised dealers also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturers , and stand ready to make good on any warranty claims . When the prospective customer goes into a franchised dealer 's showroom he finds a floor full of cars , each of which bears a sticker giving the " suggested list price " of that car , plus any extras with which it is equipped and their prices . This is what the manufacturer thinks this particular car should sell for . Few of them do . Unless a car is in particularly short . supply or is in especially strong demand , the dealer often gives a discount from the price on the sticker . The extent of the discount depends largely on the bargaining skill of the customer , but it sometimes runs into several hundred dollars . Now Car Costs Vary Moreover , most people who buy a new car have an old one to trade in and the allowance they get for their.used car varies widely . As an example , the new car with a price tag of $2,800 may , with the trade-in , cost the customer only $1,800 , , or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may cost $2,200 . The franchised dealer endeavors to make a profit on the sale of the new car , though it frequently is quite small , another profit on the eventual re-sale of the trade-in , and he hopes the buyer will return to his dealership for service , on which he also makes a profit . The auto discount house is a far less known breed of business , largely because of its ephemeral existence ; such discount houses open and close at the drop of a hubcap . They 've been around in varying numbers since the early 1950s . ' A substantial number  --  two dozen or more  --  sprung up on the West Coast , mainly in Southern California , in late 1960 and early 1961 but most of these have Write closed . Others have appeared all over the country . The Government 's suit against GM claims that discount house sales of new Cheintlets began about 1953 , with the sale of a few hundred in Southern California . In 1960 , the indictment says , . more than 2,000 new Chevrolets were sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's not the amount of business discounters have done but fear of what they might do that has caused many auto people to side with GM in the cur , rent case . Typically , the discount house has nothing but a showroom . There is no service department and few if any salesmen . ' Ironically , the discount operatOr buys his cars from certain franchised dealers , but often in wholesale lots and almost always at . prices the franchised dealers would ? be reluctant to quote in their own showrooms . The discount operator 's cost of doing business is low . Sometimes he.even avoids having to stock cars . In such cases , he simply acts as a " bird dog " and refers the customer to a franchised dealer , collecting a. fee ter his service . A customer who buys a new car from a discount house must take ' his auto to a franchised dealer to get it serviced ; any warranty , work must be done by . a franchised dealer since the discount house is " unable to perform it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes his car did n't sell it to him in the first place , the dealer might ' be reluctant to make good on any warranty claims . What , then , is the attraction of the discount - house to the new car buyer ? The main attraction , which often proves illusory , is price . Since he does n't have the heavy overhead of the franchised dealer , the discounter sometimes can sell new cars at lower prices than a franchised dealer and still turn a profit . Another factor favoring the discounters is the word " discount " itself , normally promit nently displayed in advertising . Apparently some customers are satisfied that they are getting a favorable deal Just by buying at a discount house . There 's another point which may be even ? more significant . Most discounters quote a single price for a particular car and stick ' to it . There 's no haggling . Some persons , especially those averse to bargaining , find such an unwavering price a great relief . They can go away satisfied that not only have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they also can feel sure no one else got a better deal through superior bargaining ability . When Discounters Prosper In general , discount operators prosper when new car sales are sluggish and inventories are high . Then franchised dealers frequently want to reduce inventories simply to get back some of the cash tied up in their stocks and they 're sometimes willing to sell for little or no profit . With auto men fear most of all is the possibility of huge auto discount houses in which side by side sit Chevys , Fords , Plymouths and other makes , each with the price clearly labeled . A single attendant at the door ' could collect the customers ' money as they t drive out with their new cars . Sales could be made ' without benefit of a sales pitch that one car is better than another and , worse from the manufacturers ' view , without the dis . counter even caring what kind of car is sold . " It 's a sales manager 's nightmare , " says one auto executive . As might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discounters on a somewhat higher plane than all this . Frederic G. Donner , GM 's chairman , in commenting on the indictments , said his company had received complaints that cars purchased from discounters were n't properly conditioned and that warranty service was n't available . GM told its dealers , ac , cording to Mr. Donner , that it was necessary " to assure proper pre-delivery conditioning and service and maintenance by trained mechanics with equipped service facilities , lest an automobile become a public safety hazard as well as an economic risk to its owners . " Adds Mr. Donner : " General Motors always has recognized that an automobile manufacturer 's responsibility in the eyes of the user does not end with the sale of the product to its dealers .
