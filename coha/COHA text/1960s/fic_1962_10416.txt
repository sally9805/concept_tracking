moved sideways into her living room , glancing around as if to see it through a visitor 's eyes . It was tiny and clean and poor , furnished with the kind of cheap plastic pieces that you 're still paying installments on when they disintegrate . She turned up the three-way lamp and invited me to sit at one end of the chesterfield . She sat at the other end , hunched forward , her sharp elbows resting on her knees . " So where did you see him ? " " Malibu . " I was n't paying much attention to what I said . There was a framed oil painting on the wall above the television set . Though it was recognizable as a portrait of Mrs. Simpson , it looked amateurish to me . I went over and examined it more closely . " That 's supposed to be me , " she said behind me . " It 's not a bad likeness . Did your husband do it ? " " Yeah . It 's a hobby he has . He wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man he knew , a real painter , told him he was n't good enough . That 's the story of his life , hopeful beginningsand nothing endings . So now he 's living the life of Riley in Malibu while I stay here and work my fingers to the bone . What 's he doing , beachcombing ? " I did n't answer her question right away . A dog-eared paperbackentitled The Art of Detection lay on top of the television set . It was the only book I could see in the room . I picked it up and riffled through the pages . Many of them were heavily underlined ; some of them were illustrated with bad cartoons penciled in the margins . " That was another one of Ralph 's big deals , " she said . " He was going to be a great detective and put us on easy street . Naturally he did n't get to first base . He never got to first base with any of his big wheels and deals . A man heknows on the cops told him with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I laid the book down . " Ralph has a record ? "  | " Not really . That was just a manner of speaking . " Her eyes had hardened defensively . " You did n't tell me what he was doing in Malibu . " " I 'm not even certain it was your husband I saw there . " " What did he look like ? " I described Burke Damis , and thought I caught the light of recognition in her eyes . But she said definitely : " It is n't him . " " I 'd like to be sure about that . Do you have a photograph of Ralph ? " " No . He never had his picture taken . " " Not even a wedding picture ? " " We had one taken , but Ralph never got around to picking up the copies . We were married in Reno , see , and he could n't hold on to the twenty dollars long enough . He ca n't keep away from the tables when he 's in Reno . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All the time he can get away from work . I used to go along with him , I used to think it was fun . I had another think coming . It 's the reason we never been able to save a nickel . " I moved across the room and sat beside her . " What does Ralph do for a living , Mrs. Simpson ? " " Anything he can get . He never finished high school , and that makes it tough . He 's a pretty good short-order cook , but he hated the hours . Same with bartending , which he did for a while . He 's had some good-paying houseboy jobs around the Peninsula . But he 's too proud for that kind of work . He hates to take orders from people . Maybe , " she added bitterly , " he 's too proud for any kind of work , and that 's why he ran out on me . " How long ago did he leave ? " " Two months ago , I told you that . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just got back from Nevada that same day , and he took right off for Los Angeles . I think he only came home to try and talk me out of the car . But I told him he was n't going to leave me marooned without a car . So hep52finally broke down and took a bus . I drove him down to the bus station . " " What was he planning to do in Los Angeles ? " " I do n't know . He told me this story , when he was trying to talk me out of the car , but I did n't believe it . He said he was doing undercover work . I heard the same story from him before , when he was working in a drive-in on Camino Real . He claimed the cops were paying him to give them tips . " " Tips about what ? " " Kids smoking reefers , stuff like that . I did n't know whether to believe him or not . I thought maybe he was just talking to make himself feel important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But his record would n't let him . " " He has no record . " " You said he had . " " You must have been hearing things . Anyway , I 'm getting tired . I 've had enough of this . " She rose in a sudden thrust of energy and stood by the door , inviting me to leave . I stayed where I was on the plastic chesterfield . " You might as well leave , " she said . " It is n't Ralph you saw in Malibu . " " I 'm not so sure of that . " " You can take my word . " " All right , I take your word . " It does n't pay to argue with a source of information . " But I 'm still interested in Ralph . Are n't you ? " " Naturally I am . I 'm married to him . At least I 'm supposed to be married to him . But I got a funny feeling , here . " Her left hand moved up her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he traded me in on a new model , and that 's the undercover work . " " Do you know who the other woman might be ? " " No . I just got a feeling . Why would a man go away and not come back ? "  |p53I  could think of various answers to that , but I did n't see much point in spelling them out . " When Ralph took the bus south , did he say anything about going to Mexico ? " " Not to me he did n't . " " Has he ever been there ? " " I do n't think so . He would of told me if he had . " " Did he ever talk about leaving the country ? " " Not lately . He used to talk about going back to Japan someday . He spent some time there in the Korean War . Wait a minute , though . He took his birth certificate with him , I think . That could mean he was planning to leave the States , could n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Los Angeles ? " " I guess he did , but it was a couple of weeks before that he had me looking for it . It took me hours to find it . He wanted to take it along to Nevada with him . He said he needed it to apply for a job . " " What kind of a job ? " " He did n't say . He was probably stringing me , anyway . " She moved restlessly and stood over me . " You think he left the country ? " Before I could answer her , a telephone rang in another part of the house . She stiffened , and walked quickly out of the room . I heard her voice : " This is Vicky Simpson speaking . " There was a long pause . " I do n't believe it , " she said . Another pause . " It ca n't be him , " she said . " He ca n't be dead . " I followed the fading sound of her voice into the kitchen . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiver away from her head as if it was a dangerous yellowbird . The pupils of her eyes had expanded and made her look blind . " Who is it , Mrs. Simpson ? " Her lips moved , groping for words . " A caw  --  a policemanp54down south . He says Ralph is dead . He ca n't be . " " Let me talk to the man . " She handed me the receiver . I said into the mouthpiece : " This is Lew Archer . I 'm a licensed private detective working in co-operation with the Los Angeles District Attorney 's of-fice . " " We had a query from them this evening . " The man 's voice was slow and uncertain . " We had this body on our hands , unidentified . Their chief investigator called  --  fellow named Colton , maybe you know him . " " I know him . Who am I talking to ? " " Leonard , Sergeant Wesley Leonard . I do the identification work for the sheriff 's department here in Citrus County . We use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already asked for their help on this body . Mr. Colton wanted to know if maybe it was this certain Ralph Simpson who is missing . We must have mislaid the original missing report , " he added apologetically , " or maybe we never got it in the first place . " " It happens all the time . " " Yeah . Anyway , we 're trying to get a positive identification . What 's the chances of Mrs. Simpson coming down here ? " " Pretty good , I think . Does the body fit the description ? " " It fits all right . Height and weight and coloring and estimatedage , all the same . " " How did he die ? " " That 's a little hard to say . He got pretty banged up when the bulldozer rooted him out . " " A bulldozer rooted him out ? " " I 'll explain . They 're putting in this new freeway at the west end of town . Quite a few houses got condemned to the state , they were standing vacant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of one of them . He was n't buried very deep . A ' dozer snagged him and brought him up when they razed the houses last week . "  | " How long dead ? " " A couple of months , the doe thinks . It 's been dry , and he 's in pretty fair condition . The important thing is who he is . How soon can Mrs. Simpson get down here ? " " Tonight , if I can get her on a plane . " " Swell . Ask for me at the courthouse in Citrus Junction . Sergeant Wesley Leonard . " She said when I hung up : " Oh no you do n't , I 'm staying here . " She retreated across the kitchen , shocked and stumbling , and stood in a corner beside the refrigerator . " Ralph may be dead , Vicky . " " I do n't believe it . I do n't want to see him if he is . " " Somebody has to identify him . " " You identify him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her mascara had started to dissolve . She dashed murky tears from her eyes . " I do n't want to see him dead . I never saw anybody dead before . " " Dead people wo n't hurt you . It 's the live ones that hurt you . " I touched her goosefleshed arm . She jerked it away from me . " You 'll feel better if you have a drink , " I said . " Do you have anything to drink in the house ? " " I do n't drink . " I opened a cupboard and found a glass and filled it at the tap . Some of it spilled down her chin . She scrubbed at it angrily with a dish towel . " I do n't want to go . It 'll only make me sick . " But after a while she agreed to get ready while I phoned the coastal airlines . There was room for us on a ten-thirty flight to Los Angeles . By midnight we were approaching Citrus junction in the car I had left at International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick orange groves . Itp56emerged into a desolate area rimmed with houses , where highway construction had been under way . Earth movers hulked in the darkness like sleeping saurians . The road became the main street of the town . It was a backcountrytown , in spite of its proximity to Los Angeles . Everythingwas closed for the night , except for a couple of bars . A few men in working clothes wandered along the empty pavements , staggering under the twin burdens of alcohol and loneliness . " I do n't like it here , " Vicky said . " It looks like hicksville . " " You wo n't have to stay long . " " How long ? I 'm stony until payday . " " The police will probably make arrangements for you . Let 's wait and see how it falls . " The metal cupola of the courthouse swelled like a tarnished bubble under the stars . The building 's dark interior smelled mustily of human lives , like the inside of an old trunk . I found the duty deputy in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sergeant Leonard was at the mortuary , just around the corner . It was a three-storied white colonial building with a sign on the lawn in front of it : " Norton 's Funeral Parlors . " Vicky hung back when we got out of the car . I took her arm and walked her down a hall through the odor of carnations to a lighted doorway at the end of the hall and through it into the odor of formaldehyde . She dragged on my arm . " I ca n't go through with it . " " You have to . It may not be Ralph . " " Then what am I doing here ? " " It may be Ralph . " She looked wildly around the room . It was bare except for a grey coffin standing on trestles against the wall . " Is he in that ? " " No . Get yourself under control , Vicky . It do afterward ? "  |p57It  was a question I could n't attempt to answer . A further door opened , and a deputy with sergeant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was a middle-aged man with a belly overlapping his gunbelt , and slow friendly eyes that went with his voice on the telephone . " I 'm Leonard . " " Archer . This is Mrs. Simpson . " He bowed with exaggerated courtliness . " I 'm pleased to know you , ma'am . It was good of you to make the journey . " " I had to , I guess . Where is he ? " " The doctor 's working on him . " " You mean he 's still alive ? " " He 's long dead , ma'am . I 'm sorry . Dr. White is working on his internal organs , trying to find out what killed him . " She started to sit down on the floor . I caught her under the arms . Leonard and I helped her into an adjoining room where a night light burned and the smell of carnations was strong . She half lay on an upholstered settee , with her spike heels tucked under her . " If you do n't mind waiting a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your inspection . " Leonard 's voice had taken on unctuous intonations from the surroundings . He hovered over her . " Maybe I could get you a drink . What would you like to drink ? " " Embalming fluid . " He made a shocked noise at the back of his palate . " Just go away and leave me alone . I 'm all right . " I followed Leonard into the autopsy room . The dead man lay on an enameled table . I wo n't describe him . His time in the earth , and on the table , had altered him for the worse . He bore no great resemblance to Burke Damis , and never had . Dr. White was closing a butterfly incision in the body . His rubber-gloved hands looked like artificial hands . He was a bald-headed man with hound jowls drooping from under a tobacco-stained mustache . He had a burning cigarette in hisp58mouth , and wagged his head slowly from side to side to keep the smoke out of his eyes . The smoke coiled and drifted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he was doing and had drawn a rubberized sheet up to the dead man 's chin . " What did you find out , Doctor ? " " Heart puncture , in the left ventricle . Looks like an icepick wound . " He stripped off his rubber gloves and moved to the sink , saying above the noise of running water : " Those contusionson the head were inflicted after death , in my opinion  --  a long time after death . " " By the bulldozer ? " " I assume so . " " Just when was he dug up ? " " Friday , was n't it , Wesley ? " The Sergeant nodded . " Friday afternoon . " " Did you make a preliminary examination then ? " Dr. White turned from the sink , drying his hands and arms . " None was ordered . The D.A . and the Sheriff , who 's also Coroner , are both in Sacramento at a convention . " " Besides , " Leonard put in , eager to save face , " the icepick wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was just a little nick under the left breast . " It was n't for me to tell them their business . I wanted cooperation . " Did you find the icepick ? " Leonard spread his hands loosely . " You could n't find anythingout there after the ' dozers went through . Maybe you saw the mess on your way into town ? " " I saw it . Are you ready for Mrs. Simpson now ? " I was talking to the doctor and the Sergeant , but the questionhung in the air as though it belonged to the dead man on the table . I even had a feeling that he might answer me . The room was getting me down . I brought Vicky Simpson into it . The time by herself had calmed her . She had strength enough to walk across the roomp59and stand by the table and look down at the ruined head for a minute , for minutes on end . " It 's him . It 's Ralph . " She proved it by stroking his dusty hair . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " He was icepicked , ma'am , a couple of months ago . " " You mean he 's been dead all this time ? " " A couple of months . " The two months of waiting seemed to rush across her eyes like dizzy film . She turned blindly . I took her back to the room where the night light burned . " Do you know who killed him , Vicky ? " " How would I know ? I 've never even been in Citrus Junction  --  isthat what they call this hole ? " " You mentioned that Ralph was paid by the police to gather information . " " That 's what he said . I do n't know if it was true or not . Anyway , it was a long time ago . " " Did Ralph have criminal connections ? " " No . He was n't that kind of a man . " " You said he had a record . " She shook her head . " You might as well tell me , Vicky . It ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount to anything , " she said . " He was just a kid . He got in with a bad crowd in high school and they got caught smoking reefers one time and they all got sent to Juvie . That was all the record Ralph had . " " You 're certain ? " " I 'm not lying . " " Did he ever speak of a man named Burke Damis ? " " Burke Damis ? " " Damis is the man I met in Malibu , the one I described to you . He 's an artist , a painter , who apparently has been using your husband 's name . " " Why would he do that ? "  | " Perhaps because he 's ashamed of his own name . I believehe used Ralph 's name to cross the border from Mexico lastweek . You 're sure the name Burke Damis rings no bell ? " " I 'm sure . " " And you do n't recognize the description ? " " No . At this point I would n't recognize my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever going to leave me alone ? " Leonard came into the room . I suspected that he had been listening outside the door , and chose this moment to break up the interview . He was a kind man , and he said that he and his wife would look after Vicky for the balance of the night . I drove home to Los Angeles , home to a hot shower and a cold drink and a dark bed . I HAD A DREAM which I 'd been dreaming in variant forms for as long as I could remember . I was back in high school , in my senior year . The girl at the next desk smiled at me snootily . " Poor Lew . You 'll fail the exams . " I had to admit to myself that this was likely . The finals loomed up ahead like the impossible slopes of purgatory , guarded by men with books I had n't read . " I 'm going to college , " she said . " What are you going to do ? " I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreaming mind that I was a grown man in my forties . There was n't anything more that high school could do to me . Yet here I was , back in Mr. Merritt 's classroom , dreading the finals and wondering what I would do when I had failed them . " You 'll have to learn a trade , " the snooty one said . So far it was more or less the dream I had always had.  |p61Then  something different happened . I said to the girl , rather snootily : " I have a trade , kiddo . I 'm a detective . You 'll be reading about me in the papers . " I woke up with a warm feeling in my chest and the small birds peeping outside the pale grey rectangle of the window . The dream had never ended this way before . Did it mean that I had made it ? That did n't seem likely . You went on making it , or trying to , all your life  --  working your way up the same old terraced slopes with different street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind , muffling the bird sounds and draining the last of the warm feeling from my chest . There were two cases , really . One belonged to me and one belonged to the authorities , but they were connected . The link between them was small but definite : the airline envelope with Q. R. Simpson 's name on it which Burke Damis , or possiblysomeone else , had left in the beach house . I wanted to explore the connection further , without too much interference from the police . The possibility existed that Damis had come by the envelope , or even used the name , quite innocently . It was broad daylight and the birds had finished their matins when I went back to sleep . I slept late into the morning . Perhaps I was hoping for another good dream . More likely I was fixing my schedule so that I would n't have time to report in to Peter Colton . I had become a great frequenter of airports . Before I set out this time , I dug my birth certificate out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definite plan to use it . I just thought it would be nice to have along . The polite young man at the Mexicana desk greeted me like a long-lost brother . The crew I was interested in had alreadychecked in for their flight , and the steward and stewardesshad gone up to the restaurant for coffee . He was tall and dark ; she was short and plump and pretty , with red hair . They both had on Mexicana uniforms , and I surely could n't miss them.  |p62I  picked them out in the murmurous cavern of the restaurant , hunched over coffee cups at one of the long counters . The girl had an empty stool beside her , and I slid onto it . She was certainly pretty , though the red hair that curled from under her overseas-type cap had been dyed . She had melting dark eyes and a stung-cherry mouth . Like American airline hostesses , she had on enough make-up to go on the stage . She was talking in Spanish with the steward , and I waited for a pause in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what can I do for you ? " she said in a pleasantly accented voice . " I 'm looking for a little information . A week ago yesterday , a man and woman I know took your flight from Guadalajara to Los Angeles . That was Monday , July the tenth . You may remember them , or one of them . The woman is quite tall , about your age , blonde . She often wears dark glasses , and she probably had on expensive clothes . Her name is Harriet Black-well . " She nodded her head emphatically . " I remember Miss Blackwell , yes  --  a very nice lady . The lady across from her was sick  --  we had some rough air out of Mazatlan  --  and she took care of the sick lady 's baby for her . " She said to the steward beside her : " You remember the tall lady who was so nice with the baby ? " " Si . " " Is Miss Blackwell all right ? " she asked me solicitously . " I think so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her afterward , after we landed . And now you are inquiring about her . " " What did you think about her after you landed ? " " I thought  --  do you speak Spanish ? I express myself better in Spanish . " " Your English is ten times better than my Spanish will ever be . "  | " Gracias , senor . " She gave me a full dazzling smile . " Well , I saw her after we landed , going through Customs . She looked very  --  excited . I thought she was going to faint . I approached her and inquired if she was all right . The man with her said that she was all right . He did n't like  --  he did n't want me asking questions , so I went away . " " Can you describe the man ? " " Yes . " She described Burke Damis . " A very beautiful young man , " she added with a trace of satire in her voice . " What was his name ? " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in rapid Spanish . He shrugged . He did n't remember either . " Who would know ? " " You , perhaps , " she said pertly . " You said they were your friends . " " I said I knew them . " " I see . Are they in trouble ? " " That 's an interesting question . What brings it up ? " " You , " she said . " You look like trouble for them . " " For him , not for her . Did they sit together on the plane ? " " Yes . They embarked together at Guadalajara . I noticedthem , I thought they were recien casados  --  honeymooners . But they had different names . " " What was his name ? " " I said I do n't remember . If I can find the passenger list  --  " " Try and do that , will you ? " " You are a policeman ? " " An investigator . " " I see . Where will I see you ? " " On the plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked at my watch . I had half an hour till flight time . " We are never crowded in the middle of the week . " She turned out to be right . I bought a return ticket to Guadalajara from my courteous friend , leaving the date of myp64return open . At another desk in the same building I applied for a Mexican tourist card . The hurried clerk who took my application barely glanced at my birth certificate . " I 'll type up your card pronto . Your plane will take off soon . " In the time I had left , I made the necessary call to Colonel Blackwell . He picked up the phone on the first ring , as if he had been waiting there beside it . " Mark Blackwell speaking . " " This is Archer . Have you heard anything from Harriet ? " " No . I do n't expect to . " Isis voice rose shakily from the depths of depression . " You have n't either , I take it . " " No . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bay area last night . " " Is that where they 've gone ? " " It 's possible , but it 's not why I went up there . To make a long story short , I stumbled on a murder which Damis may be involved in . " " A murder ? " His voice sank almost out of hearing . He said in a rustling whisper : " You 're not trying to tell me that Harriet has been murdered ? " " No . It 's a man named Simpson , icepicked in Citrus Junctiontwo months ago . I 'm trying to trace his connection with Damis , and get a line on Damis 's identity and background . The next logical step , as I see it , is to go back to the point where Harriet met him and work forward from there . If it 's all right with you , I intend to fly down to Mexico .

But any member of the Americancommunity should be able to tell you where she lives . Pauline was never one to hide her light under a bushel . " " Her last name is Hatchen ? " " That is correct . Good luck . " He sounded as though his own had run out . The plane was barely half full . I had a window seat over the left wing . As the redheaded stewardess placed me in it , I noticed that she looked at me in a peculiar way . The broken jigsaw of Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had leveled out at cruising altitude , the stewardess slipped into the empty seat beside me . She held a folded newspaper in the hand away from me . Under the make-up , her color was n't good . " I found the seating chart for July  --  July ten . The man with Miss Blackwell , his name was Simpson , Q. R. Simpson . " " I thought so . " " You thought so ? " Her look was accusing . " Why did n't you tell me , then , that Senor Simpson is dead ? " " I was n't aware of it " It was a half truth , or a half lie , according to which version of Simpson we were talking about . " How do you know he is , Miss Gomez ?

" " You said you are an investigator . Are you investigating his murder ? " " It 's beginning to look like it , is n't it ? " " And you suspect someone from Mexico ? " she said in a nationalistic way . " Someone from the United States . " This relieved her , but not for long . " Poor Miss Blackwell , she was so crazy about him . All the time , even when she was holding the lady 's baby , she kept looking at him like "  --  she searched for a phrase  --  " like he was a saint . " " He was no saint .

The doubleness of the conversation was getting on my nerves ; or perhaps it was the doubleness of my attitude toward Damis . In spite of the evidence tightening around him , I was trying to keep an open mind . I was glad when the girl went to attend to her duties . She stayed away . When she passed me in the aisle , she carefully avoided meeting my eyes . I think she was afraid of the contagionI carried from Simpson 's death . We were flying over the sea within sight of land . The air was perfectly transparent . Baja California passed under the wing like the endless harsh shores of hell , its desolation unbrokenby tree or house or human being . As the sun declined , the shadows of the yellow hills length/ened into the dry valleys . The first green and brown checkerboardof cultivated fields came as a relief to the eye and the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gomez unbent a little when she brought me my dinner . " Are you enjoying the flight , sir ? " I said yes . We circled in over Mazatlan in a red sunset . The three rocky islands offshore jutted up angrily out of a streaked purplesea . A single freighter lay in the harbor with the fishing boats . At the other end of the town , beyond the airport where we landed , new apartment buildings stood along the sea like a miniature Copacabana . We were herded into the terminal building , to have our tourist cards checked , it was explained . A boy was selling , or trying to sell , costumed puppets which he manipulated on a string . His bare arms were almost as thin as the wooden arms of his dolls . The line of passengers moved forward slowly in steamy heat . I got my turn at the battered rostrumlike desk where a man in an open-necked white shirt presided . He had pockmarks on his face , and they gave special emphasis to his question : " Certificado de vacunacion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had told me . That was a silly thing to say , but I said it .

" He summoned an attendant in olive whipcord who escorted me to an office at the far end of the building . A dark and ( lumpy woman in white was waiting at the desk with a maternalsmile . The white masonry wall behind her had jagged cracks in it . " Vaccination ? "  | " I 'm afraid so . " She took my name and home address on a filing card .

" " Two or three a day , at least , since the government clamped down . People are always forgetting their certificates , or else they did n't get the word in the first place . They process so many at the L.A. airport that they get careless . " I said , on the off-chance of learning something : " A man I know passed through here from L.A. some time in the last two months . I 'm wondering if you had to vaccinate him . " " What does he look like ? " I described Burke Damis . She twisted her mouth to one side . " I think I do remember him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he did n't like the needle . Ile tried to talk himself out of it . " " When was this ? " " I could n't say exactly . A couple of months ago , like you said . I could look it up if you 'll give me his name . " " Quincy Ralph Simpson . " She opened one of the desk drawers , went through a filing box of cards , and picked out one of them . " Here it is , Simpson . I gave him his shot on May twenty . " It meant that Burke Damis had entered Mexico two days after the original Simpson left home for the last time . It probablymeant that Simpson had been murdered between Mayp69i8 and May zo , more likely than not by the man who had stolen his name . " A very nice-appearing young man , " the woman was saying . " We had a nice chat after we got the vaccination out of the way . " " Chat about what ? " " My daughter in Los Angeles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She waved her hand toward the cracks in the masonry . " I was asking myself the same thing . " " It was no earthquake . The hurricane did it . It practically tore out the whole end of the building . You 'd never know it was built in the last ten years . " The man in the whipcord uniform came back . He had two more victims with him , a young couple who were explaining that they had been assured that these formalities could be taken care of when they got to Mexico City . The nurse smiled at them maternally . IT WAS RAINING HARD when we put downat Guadalajara , as if our descent had ruptured a membrane in the lower sky . In spite of the newspaper tent I held over my head , the short walk from the plane to the terminal pasted my clothes to my back . I exchanged some damp dollars for some dry pesos and asked the cashier to get me an English-speaking taxi driver , if possible . The porter he dispatched reappeared with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under his dripping mustache . " Yessir , where you want to go ? " " Ajijic , if they have a hotel there . "  | " Yessir , they have a very nice posada . " He led me across the many-puddled parking lot to a fairly new Simca sedan . I climbed squishing into the front seat . " Wet night . " " Yessir . " He drove me through it for half an hour , entertaining me with fragments of autobiography . Like the nurse who had vaccinated me in Mazatlan , he had learned his English in the Central Valley . " I was a wetback , " he said with some pride . " Three times I walked across the border . Two times they picked me up on the other side and hauled me back on a bus . The third time , I made it , all the way to Merced . I worked around Merced for four years , in the fields . You know Merced ? " " I know it . How were working conditions ? " " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . I made enough to come back home and go into business . " He slapped the wheel of his Simca . We emerged from between steep black hills onto a lakeshoreroad . I caught pale glimpses of ruffled water . A herd of burros crossed the headlights and galloped away into darkness . Through the streaming windshield they looked like the grey and shrunken ghosts of horses . Church towers , buttressed by other buildings , rose from the darkness ahead . The rain was letting up , and had stopped by the time we reached the village . Though it was past ten o'clock , children swarmed in the doorways . Their elders were promenading in the steep cobbled streets , which had drained already . At the corner of the central square an old woman in a shawl had set up a wooden table on the sidewalk . She was serving some kind of stew out of a pot , and I caught a whiff of it as we went by . It had a heady pungency , an indescribable smell which aroused no memories ; expectation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mexico.  |p71I  felt closer to home when we reached the posada . The night clerk was a big middle-aged American named Stacy , and he was glad to see me . The pillared lobby of the place had a deserted air . Stacy and I and my driver , who was waiting for me just inside the entrance , were the only human beingswithin sight or sound . Stacy fussed over me like somebody trying to give the impression that he was more than one person . " I can certainly fix you up , Mr. Archer . I can give you your choice of several nice private cottages . " " Any one of them will do . I think I 'll only be staying one night . " He looked disappointed . " I 'll send out the mozo for your luggage . " " I have no luggage . " " But you 're all wet , man . " " I know . Luckily this is a drip-dry suit . " " You ca n't let it dry right on you . " He clucked sympathetically . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll lend you some slacks and a sweater if you like . Unless you 're thinking of going right to bed . " " I was n't intending to . You 're very kind . " " Anything for a fellow American , " he said in a mocking tone which was half serious after all . He took me through a wet garden to my cottage . It was clean and roomy ; a fire was laid in the fireplace . He left me with instructions to use the bottled water , even for cleaning my teeth . I lit the fire and hung up my wet suit on a wall bracket above the mantel . Stacy came back after a while with an armful of dry clothes . His large rubbery face was flushed with generosity and a meantime drink . The flannel slacks he gave me were big in the waist . I cinched them in with my belt and pulled on his blue turtleneck sweater . It had a big monogrammed " S " like a target over the heart , and it smelled of the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell masculine . " You look very nice , " Stacy declared . He stood and watched me in wistful empathy . Perhaps he saw himself with ten pounds shifted from his waistline to his shoulders , and ten lost years regained . He got a bit flustered when I told him I was going out . He may have been looking forward to an intimate conversation by the fire : And what is your philosophy of life ? Keep moving , amigo . Stacy knew where the Hatchens lived , and passed the word in rapid Spanish to my driver . We drove to a nameless street . The only sign at the corner had been painted on a wall by an amateur hand : " Cristianismo si , Comunismo no " A church tower rose on the far side of the wall . The Hatchens ' gate was closed for the night . I knocked for some time before I got a response . My knocking was n't the only sound in the neighborhood . Up the street a radio was going full blast ; hoofs clip-clopped ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church tower rang the three-quarter hour and then repeated it for those who were hard of hearing ; a pig squealed . A man opened the upper half of the wicket gate and flashed a bright light in my face . " Quien es ? Are you American ? " " Yes . My name is Archer . You 're Mr. Hatchen ? " " Dr. Hatchen . I do n't know you , do I ? Is there some trou-ble ? " " Nothing immediate . Back in the States , your wife 's daughter , Harriet , has run off with a young man named Burke Damis whom you may know . I came here to investigate him for Colonel Blackwell . Are you and Mrs. Hatchen willing to talk to me ? " " I suppose we ca n't refuse . Come back in the morning , eh ? " " I may not he here in the morning . If you 'll give me a little time tonight , I 'll try to make it short . "  | " All right . " I paid off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He led me up a brick walk through an enclosed garden . The flashlight beam jumped along in front of us across the uneven bricks . He was a thin aging man who walked with great strenuosity . He paused under an outside light before we entered the house . " Just what do you mean when you say Harriet 's run off with Damis ? " " She intends to marry him . " " Is that bad ? " " It depends on what I find out about him . I 've already come across some dubious things . " " For instance ? " He had a sharp wizened face in which the eyes were bright and quick . " Apparently he came here under an alias . " " That 's not unusual . The Chapala woods are full of people living incognito . But come in . My wife will be interested . " He turned on a light in a screened portico and directed me through it to a further room . A woman was sitting there on a couch in an attitude of conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head . Her black formal gown accentuated the white puffiness of her shoulders . The classic lines of her chin and throat were a little blurred by time . " This is Mr. Archer , Pauline . My wife , " Hatchen said proudly . She took my hand with the air of a displaced queen and held onto it in a subtle kind of Indian wrestling until I was sitting beside her on the couch . " Sit down , " she said unnecessarily . " To what do we owe the pleasure ? " " Mr. Archer is an emissary from dear old Mark . " " How fascinating . And what has dear old Mark been up top74now ? Wait , do n't tell me . Let me guess . " She held a forefingerupright in front of her nose . " He 's worried about Har-riet . " " You 're a good guesser , Mrs. Hatchen . " She smiled thinly . " It 's the same old story . He 's always brooded over her like a father hen . " " Mother hen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At any rate , she 's run off and married that Damis chap , " he said . " I 'm not surprised . I 'm glad she had it in her . All Harriet ever needed was a little of her mother 's spirit and fortitude . Speaking of spirits , Mr. Archer "  --  she waved her finger  --  " Keith and I were just about to have a nightcap . Wo n't you join us ? " Hatchen looked at her brightly . He was still on his feet in the middle of the room . " You 've had your ration , dear one . You know what the doctor said . " " The doctor 's in Guad and I 'm here . " " I 'm here , too . " " So be a sport and get us all a drink . You know what I like . " He shrugged and turned to me . " What will you have ? " " Whisky ? " " I ca n't recommend the whisky . The gin 's okay . " " Gin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room with a nervous glance at his wife , as if she might be contemplating elopement . She turned the full panoply of her charm on me . " I know you must think I 'm a strange sort of mother , totally unconcerned with my daughter 's welfare and so on . The fact is I 'm a kind of refugee . I escaped from Mark and his menage long long ago . I have n't even seen him for thirteen years , and for once that 's a lucky number . I turned over a fresh page and started a new chapter  --  a chapter dedicated to love and free/dom . " Romanticism soughed in her voice like a loosely strung Aeolian harp . " It is n't entirely clear to me why you left him . " She took the implied question as a matter of course . " The marriage was a mistake . We had really very little in common . I love movement and excitement , interesting people , people with a sense of life . " She looked at me sideways . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm surprised that you should be a friend of Mark 's . He used to spend his spare time doing research on the Blackwell genealogy . " " I did n't say I was a friend of Mark 's . " " But I understood be sent you here . " " I 'm a private detective , Mrs. Hatchen . He hired me to look into Damis 's background . I was hoping you could give me some assistance . " " I barely knew the fellow . Though I sensed from the beginningthat Harriet was smitten with him . " " When was the beginning ? " " A few days after she got here . She came a little over a month ago . I was really glad to see her . " She sounded surprised . " A little disappointed , perhaps , but glad . " " Why disappointed ? " " I had various reasons . I 'd always sort of hoped that she 'd outgrow her ugly-duckling phase , and she did to some extent , of course . After all she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her brow and moved down her nose to her mouth and chin , which she tilted up . " And I was disappointed that we did n't really have anything in common . She did n't take to our friends or our way of life . We did our best to make her comfortable , but she moved out before the end of the first week . " " And moved in with Damis ? " " Harriet would n't do that . She 's quite a conventional girl . She rented a studio down near the lake . I think he had one somewhere in the neighborhood . I have no doubt they spent a lot of time together . More power to them , I thought . "  | " Did you know Burke Damis before she met him ? " " No , and she did n't meet him in our casa . We 'd seen him around , of course , but we 'd never met him till Harriet introducedhim . That was a few days after she got here , as I said . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cantina mostly . I think that 's where Harriet picked  --  where Harriet met him . A lot of arty young people hang out there , or used to . " " You saw him there before she met him ? " " Oh , yes , several times . He 's rather conspicuously goodlooking , do n't you think ? " " Was he using the name Burke Damis ? " " I suppose so . You could always ask the Cantina people : It 's just down the street . " " I 'll do that . Before Harriet arrived , did Damis ever try to contact you ? " " Never . We did n't know him from Adam . " Her eyes narrowed . " Is Mark trying to pin the blame on me for something ? " " No , but it occurred to me that Damis might have had her spotted before she got here . " " Spotted ? " " As a girl with money behind her . " " IIe did n't learn it from us , if that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show that he deliberately planned to meet her ? " " I doubt it . He picked her up in the Cantina and she was dazzled with gratitude , poor girl . " " Why do you say poor girl ' ? " " I 've always felt that way about Harriet . She had a rough deal , from both of us . I realize I appear to be a selfish woman , leaving her and Mark when she was just a child . But I had no choice if I wanted to save my soul . " I sat there wondering if she had saved it and waiting forp77her to elaborate . Her eyes had the hardness that comes from seeing too many changes and not being changed by them . " To make a long story short , and a sordid one , I moved into the Tahoe house and got a Reno divorce . I did n't want to do it . It broke my heart to turn my back on Harriet . But she was very much her father 's daughter . There was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder . And do n't think I have n't contemplated murder . But a Nevada divorce seemed more civilized . Keith "  --  she gestured toward the kitchen , where ice was being picked  --  " Keith was in Nevada on the same errand . What 's keeping him out there so long ? " " He may be giving us a chance to talk . " " Yes , he 's a very thoughtful man . I 've been very happy with Keith , do n't think I have n't . " There was a hint of defiance in her voice . " On the other hand , do n't think I have n't felt guilty about my daughter . When she visited us last month the old guilt feelings came back . It was so obvious that she wanted  --  that she needed something from me . Something I could n't give , and if I could , she could n't have taken it . She still blamed me for deserting her , as she put it . I tried to explain , but she would n't listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her every thought . She went into hysterics , and so did I , I suppose . We quarreled , and she moved out on me . " " It looks as though that made her ripe for Damis . I 've known other men like him . They prey on girls and women who step outside the protection of their families . " " You make him sound like a very devious type . " " He 's devious . Does the name Q. R. Simpson mean anything to you ? Quincy Ralph Simpson ? " She shook her head and her hairdo slipped . It made her entire personality seem held in place by pins . " Should I know the name ? " " I did n't really expect you to . "  | " What name ? " her husband said from the doorway . He came in carrying a hammered brass tray with three pale drinks placed geometrically on it . " The name that Burke Damis used to cross the border , comingand going . Quincy Ralph Simpson . " " I 've never heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California papers . " " But we do n't . " He passed the drinks around with a flourish . " We are happy fugitives from the California papers , and from nuclear bombs and income taxes  --  " " And the high cost of liquor , " his wife chimed in like the other half of a vaudeville team . " This gin costs me forty American cents a liter , " he said , " and I do n't believe you can top it at any price . Well , salud . " He lifted his glass . I drank from mine . The gin was all right , but it failed to warm me . There was something cold and lost about the room and the people in it . They had roosted like migrant birds that had lost their homing instincts , caught in a dream of perpetual static flight . Or so it seemed through the bottom of my glass . I set it down and got up . Hatchen rose , too . " What was that about this man Simpson and the news-papers ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of months ago . his body was found last week . " " And you say Damis was using his name ? " " Yes . " " Is he suspected of Simpson 's murder ? " " Yes . By me . " " Poor I-Iarriet , " Mrs. Hatchen said over her drink.  |p79THE  Cantina had several interconnected public rooms , and looked as though it had once been a private house . At eleven-thirty on this Tuesday night it had just about reverted to privacy . A single drinker , a big man with streaked yellow hair that hung down to his collar , sat in a corner behind the deserted bandstand . There was no one else in the place . A number of small oil paintings hung on the walls . Their blobs and blocks and whorls and scatterations reminded me of the shapes that dissolve on the retina between sleeping and waking . I felt that I was getting closer to Burke Damis , and I moved from picture to picture looking for his style or his signature . " Las pinturas , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind me . It belonged to a Mexican youth in a waiter 's apron . He had a broken nose and a mouth that had been hurt both physically and morally . Intelligence burned like fever in his black eyes . " Sorry , I do n't buy pictures . " " Nobody buys them . No more . Quoth the Raven , " Nevermore . " ' " " You read Poe ? " " In school , senor , " he said smiling . " My beautiful Annabel Lee , . . . in this kingdom by the sea . ' I studied to be a professor but my father lost his nets , I had to give it up . There is very little money , and work is not easy to find . Tourism is slow this summer . " " Why ? " He shrugged . " Who understands the migration of the birds ? I only know it is hard to make an honest living . I tried boxing , but it is not for me . " He touched his nose.  |p80His  story had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch . I liked him anyway . His battered face had an incandescence , as if the scattered lights of the dark town had gathered and were burning in him . " Something to drink , senor ? " " I guess a beer . " " Dark or light ? " " Light . " " Bueno , we have no dark . We have three bottles of light beer , one litro of tequila , and no ice . The beer is cold , however . I borrowed it . " Smiling intensely , he went into a side room and came back with a bottle and a glass . He poured the contents of the one into the other . " You pour beer well . " " Yessir . Also I can make martinis , margueritas , any kind of drink . I work at parties sometimes , which is how I speak English so good . Please to tell your friends , when they need a first-class cantinero , Jose Perez of the Cantina is at your serv-ice . " " I 'm afraid I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tourist ? " " Sort of . I 'm just passing through . " " An artist , por ventura ? " he said with an eye on Stacy 's sweater . " We used to have many artists here . My boss himself is an artist . " He glanced across the room to the solitary drinker in the corner . " I 'd like to talk to him . " " I will tell him , senor . " Jose darted across the room and said something in Spanish to the long-haired man . He picked up his drink and plodded toward me as if the room was hip-deep in water , or eye-deep in tequila . A woven belt with an amethyst-studded silver buckle divided his globular stomach into two hemispheres . " Aha , " he said . " I spy with my little eye a customer and a fellow American . "  | " Your eye is sound . My name is Archer , by the way . " He stood over me tall and leaning , a Pisan tower of flesh . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He subsided into a chair . " I am Chauncey Reynolds , no kin to Sir Joshua Reynolds , though 1 do dabble in paint . I 've always considered Sir Joshua a better critic than he was a painter . Or do n't you share my opinion ? " He hunched forward with a touch of belligerence . " I would n't know , Mr. Reynolds . I 'm not too hep artisti-cally . " " I thought you were , since you were looking at the paintings . No matter . It 's a pleasure to have a customer . " " What happened to all the other customers ? " " Ou sent les neiges d'antan ? This place was jumping , honestly , when I took over the lease . I thought I had a gold mine on my hands . " He looked down into his pudgy hands as if he was surprised by their emptiness . " Then people stopped coming . If the drought of customers persists , I 'll close up and go back to work . " He seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a living ? " " I paint . Fortunately I have a small private income . Nobodypaints for a living . You have to die before you make a living out of painting . Van Gogh , Modigliani , all the great ones had to die . " " What about Picasso ? " " Picasso is the exception that proves the rule . I drink to Pablo Picasso . " He raised his glass and drank from it . " What do you do for a living , Mr. Archer ? " " I 'm a detective . " He set down his glass with a rap . His bloodshot eyes watched me distrustfully , like a wounded bull from his querencia . " Did Gladys send you to ferret me out ? She is n't supposedto know where I am . " " I do n't know any Gladys . "  | " Honestly ? " " And I never heard of you until now . Who 's Gladys ? " " My ex-wife . I divorced her in Juarez but the New York courts do n't recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am here . Forever . " He made it sound like a long time . " The one I 'm interested in , " I said , " is a young man named Burke Damis . " " What 's he wanted for ? " " He is n't wanted . " " Kid me not . I read a great deal of mystery fiction in the long night watches , and I recognize that look you have on your face . You have the look of a shamus who is about to put the arm on a grifter . " " How well you express yourself . I take it you know Damis . " " In a casual way . He used to pass the time here , mainly before I took over the leash  --  the lease . " He leaned forward over the table , and his long hair flopped like broken wings . " Why do you suppose they all stopped coming ? Tell me  --  you 're a trained objective observer  --  do I have an offensive personality ? " " Jose tells me business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's like the migrations of the birds . " Ile looked around for Jose , who was leaning against the wall , and called for another drink . Jose replenished his glass from a bottle of tequila . " Did you ever talk to Damis ? " " Not what you 'd call intimately . He 's an attractive chap but I never got to know him . He was usually with other people . Do you know if he 's still in Ajijic ? " " No . Can you name some of the other people ? " " The one I saw him with most often was Bill Wilkinson . " " How can I get in touch with Wilkinson ? " " You might find him at The Place . I hear he 's taking most of his business there since we had our little run-in . " " Run-in ? "  | " Actually , it was Mrs. Wilkinson I had the run-in with . She 's one of those Southern California types who fancies herself as an art collector simply because she has money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Bill would be better off if he did the same . I 'm not a woman hater  --  " " Neither is Damis , I understand . Did you ever see him with women ? " " Almost invariably . He spent a lot of time with Annie Castle . That was before he took up with the blonde girl , what was her name ? " He sat locked in combat with his memory . " It does n't matter . Who is Annie Castle ? " " She runs an artsy-craftsy shop on the other side of the plaza . As a matter of fact , Damis has or had his studio on the same premises . No doubt propinquity did its deadly work . Annie 's a cute enough kid if you like them dark and serious . But he dropped her when the big little blonde showed up . " " What do you mean , big little ' ? " " Quien sabe ? Big girl , little ego , maybe . She has n't made the breakthrough , into womanhood , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Whenas she ever does , she could be quite a thing . Beauty is n't in the features so much as in the spirit , in the eyes . That 's why it 's so hard to paint . " " You 're quite an observer , " I encouraged him . " I 'm a people watcher , my friend . If you 're a detective , as you say , you must be something of a people watcher yourself . " " I 'm a walking field guide , " I said . " You seem to have paid pretty close attention to the blonde girl . " " Oh , I did . What was her name ? Miss Blackstone , I believe . Her mother introduced us some time ago . I have n't seen her lately . I tend to take special notice of the tall ones , being rather outsize myself . Gladys is nearly six feet , mirabile dictu .

" his eyes strayed around the empty rooms.  |p84I  got up . " Thanks for all the information . Can you tell me how to get to The Place ? " " I can , but look here , man , I 'm enjoying this . Drink up your beer , and I 'll have Jose make you a proper drink . Where is Jose ? Jose ! " " Do n't bother . I have to see Bill Wilkinson . " He rose cumbrously . " Whatever you say . Do you feel like telling me what this is all about ? " " I could make up a story for you . But that would be a waste of time . " I got out my wallet . " How much do I owe you for the beer ? " " Nothing . " He fanned his arm in a lordly gesture which threatened to overbalance him . " You 're a stranger within my gates , I could n't possibly accept your money . Besides , I have a feeling you 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Reynolds . " He told me how to get to The Place and I set out through the midnight streets . The children had been swallowed up by the doorways . Some men and a very few women were still out . Wrapped in blankets , with faces shadowed by volcano-shaped hats , the men had a conspiratorial look . But when I said " Buenas noches " to one small group , a chorus of " Buenas noches " followed me . THE PLACE was closed for the night . Steering a course by dead reckoning and the sound of the town clock chiming the quarter , I made my way back to the central square . It was abandoned except for one lone man locked behind the grille of the unicellular jail . Followed by his Indian gaze , I took myself for a walkp85around the perimeter of the square . Seven eighths of the way around , I was stopped by a sign in English hand-lettered on wood : " Anne 's Native Crafts . " The shutters were up but there was light behind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The noise stopped when I knocked on the door beside the shutters . Heels clicked on stone , and the heavy door creaked open . A smallish woman peered out at me . " What do you want ? It 's very late . " " I realize that , Miss Castle . But I 'm hoping to fly out of here in the morning , and I thought since you were up  --  " " I know who you are , " she said accusingly . " News travels fast in Ajijic . " " Does it not ? I can also tell you that you 're here to no purpose . Burke Damis left Ajijic some time ago . It 's true I sublet a studio to him for a brief period . But I can tell you nothing whatever about him . " " That 's funny . You know all about me , and you never even saw me before . " " There 's nothing funny about it . The waiter at the Cantina is a friend of mine . I taught his sister to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It was part of the normal course of my life and work . You are distinctly not . Now if you 'll take your big foot out of my doorway , I can get back to my weaving . " I did n't move . " You work very late . " " I work all the time . " " So do I when I 'm on a case . That gives us something in common . I think we have something else in common . " " I ca n't imagine what it would be " " You 're concerned about Burke Damis , and so am I " " Concerned ? " Her voice went tinny on the word . " I do n't know what you mean . " " I do n't either , Miss Castle . You would have to tell me . " " I 'll tell you nothing . "  | " Are you in love with Burke Damis ? " " I certainly am not ! " she said passionately , telling me a great deal . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me " " I 'm full of absurd questions . Will you let me come in and ask you some of them ? " " Why should I ? " " Because you 're a serious woman , and serious things are happening . I did n't fly down from Los Angeles for fun . " " What is happening then ? " " Among other things , " I said , " Burke has eloped with a young woman who does n't know which end is up . " She was silent for a long moment . " I know Harriet Blackwell , and I quite agree with your description of her . She 's an emotionally ignorant girl who threw  --  well , she practically threw herself at his head . There 's nothing I can do about it , or want to . " " Even if she 's in danger ? " " Danger from Burke ? That 's impossible . " " It 's more than possible , in my opinion , and I 've been giving it a good deal of thought . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes , and her odor , light and clean , devoid of perfume . " Did you really come all the way from the States to ask me about Burke ? " " Yes . " " Has he  --  done something to Harriet Blackwell ? " " I do n't know . They 've dropped out of sight . " " What makes you suspect he 's done something ? " " I 'll tell you if you 'll tell me . We both seem to have the same idea . " " No . You 're putting words into my mouth . " " I would n't have to , if you 'd talk to me . " " Perhaps I had better , " she said to me and her conscience . " Come in , Mr. Archer . " She even knew my name . I followed her into the room behind her shop . A woodenp87hand loom stood in one corner , with a piece of colored fabric growing intricately on it . The walls and furniture were covered with similar materials in brilliant designs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wore a multicolored Mexican skirt , an embroidered blouse , in her ears gold hoops that were big enough to swing on . Black hair cut short emphasized her petiteness and the individuality of her looks . Her eyes were brown and intelligent , and warmer than her voice had let me hope . She said when we were seated on the divan : " You were going to tell me what Burke has done . " " I 'd rather have your account of him first , for psychological reasons . " " You mean , " she said carefully , " that I may not want to talk after you 've done your talking ? " " Something like that . " " Is it so terrible ? " " It may be quite terrible . I do n't know . " " As terrible as murder ? " She sounded like a child who names the thing he fears , the dead man walking in the attic , the skeleton just behind the closet door , in order to be assured that it does n't exist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggesting it . " " Well , " she hedged , " you said Harriet Blackwell was in danger . " " Is that all ? " " Yes . Of course . " The skeleton had frightened her away from the verge of candor . She covered her retreat with protestations : " I 'm sure you must be mistaken . They seem fond of each other . And you could n't describe Burke as a violent man . " " How well did you know him , Miss Castle ? " She hesitated . " You asked me , before , if I was in love with him . " " I apologize for my bluntness. "  | " I do n't care . Is it so obvious ? Or has Chauncey Reynolds been telling tales out of school ? " " He said that you were seeing a lot of Burke , before Harriet Blackwell entered the picture . " " Yes . I 've been trying ever since to work him out of mysystem . With not very striking success . " She glanced at theloom in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of work . " " Do you want to tell me the story from the beginning ? " " If you insist . I do n't see how it can help you . " " How did you meet him ? " " In a perfectly natural way . He came into the shop the day after he got here . His room at the posada did n't suit him , because of the light . He was looking for a place to paint . He said he had n't been able to paint for some time , and he was burning to get at it . I happened to have a studio I 'm not using , and I agreed to rent it to him for a month or so . " " Is that how long he wanted it for ? A month ? " " A month or two , it was n't definite . " " And he came here two months ago ? " " Almost to the day . When I think of the changes there have been in just two months  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day he moved in , I had to make a speed trip to Cuad . One of my girls has a rheumatic heart and she needed emergency treatment . Burke came along for the ride , and I was impressed by his kindness to the girl  --  she 's one of my best students . After we took her to the hospital we went to the Copa de Leche for lunch and really got to know each other . " He talked to me about his plans as an artist . He 's still caught up in abstraction but he 's trying to use that method to penetrate more deeply into life . It 's his opinion that the Americanpeople are living through a tragedy unconsciously , sufferingwithout knowing that we are suffering or what the source of the suffering may be . He thinks it 's in our sexual life . " She flushed suddenly . " Burke is very verbal for a painter . "  | " I had n't noticed , " I said . " Who paid for the lunch ? " Her flush deepened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ? I paid . He was broke . I also took him to an artists ' supply house and let him charge four hundred pesos ' worth of paints on my account . It was my suggestion , not his , and I do n't regret it . " " Did he pay you back ? " " Of course . " " Before or after he attached himself to Harriet Blackwell ? " " Before . It was at least a week before she got here . " " What did he use for money ? " " He sold a picture to Bill Wilkinson , or rather to his wif e  --  she 's the one with the money . I tried to persuade him not to sell it or , if he insisted , to sell it to me . But he was determined to sell it to her , and she was determined to have it . She paid him thirty-five hundred pesos , which was more than I could afford . Later on he regretted the sale and tried to buy the picture back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ruction about it " " When was this ? " " A couple of weeks ago . I only heard about it at second hand . Burke and I were no longer speaking , and I have nothing to do with the Wilkinsons . Bill Wilkinson is a drunk married to a woman older than himself and living on her . " She paused over the words , perhaps because they had accidentally touched on her relations with Damis . " They 're dangerous people . " " I understand that Wilkinson was Burke 's boon companion . " " For a while . Bill Wilkinson is quite perceptive , in the sense that he understands people 's weaknesses , and Burke was taken in by him for a while . " " Or vice versa ? " " That was not the case . What would a man like Burke have to gain from a man like Bill Wilkinson ? " " He sold his wife a picture for thirty-five hundred pesos. "  | " It 's a very good picture , " she said defensively , " and cheap at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own work , but even he admitted that it was the kind of tragic painting he was aiming at . It was n't like his other things , apart from a few sketches . As a matter of fact , it 's representational . " " Representational ? " " It 's a portrait , " she said , " of a lovely young girl . He called it Portrait of an Unknown Woman . ' I asked him if he 'd ever known such a woman . He said perhaps he had , or perhaps he dreamed her . " " What do you think ? " " I think he must have known her , and painted her from memory . I never saw a man work so ferociously hard . He painted twelve and fourteen hours a day . I had to make him stop to eat . I 'd walk into the studio with his comida , and he 'd be working with the tears and sweat running down his face . IIe 'd paint himself blind , then he 'd go off on the town and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wee hours , and he 'd be up in the morning painting again . " " he must have given you quite a month . " " I loved it , " she said intensely . " I loved him . I still do . " It was an avowal of passion . If there was some hysteria in it , she had it under control . Everything was under control , except that she worked all the time . We sat there smiling dimly at each other . She was an attractive woman , with the kind of honesty that chisels the face in pure lines . I recalled what Chauncey Reynolds had said in drunken wisdom about Harriet , that she had n't made the breakthrough into womanhood . Anne Castle had . I kept my eyes on her face too long . She rose and moved across the room with hummingbird vitality , and opened a portable bar which stood against the wall : " May I give you something to drink , Mr. Archer ? " " No , thanks , there 's a long night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to try and see the Wilkinsons . Ip91want a look at that portrait they bought , for one thing . " She closed the door of the bar , sharply . " Have n't we fin-ished ? " " I 'm afraid not , Miss Castle . " She came back to the divan . " What more do you want from me ? " " I still do n't understand Damis and his background . Did he ever talk about his previous life ? " " Some . He came from somewhere in the Middle West . He studied at various art schools . " " Did he name them ? " " If he did , I do n't remember . Possibly Chicago was one of them . He knew the Institute collection . But most painters do . " " Where did he live before he came to Mexico ? " " All over the States , I gathered . Most of us have . " " Most of the people here , you mean ? " She nodded . " This is our fifty-first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other fifty . " " Burke came here from California , we know that . Did heever mention San Mateo County , or the Bay area in general ? " " He 'd spent some time in San Francisco . He was deeplyfamiliar with the El Grecos in the museum there . " " Painting is all he ever talked about , apparently . " " He talked about everything under the sun , " she said , " except his past life . He was reticent about that . He did tell me he 'd been unhappy for years , that I 'd made him happy for the first time since he was a boy . " " Then why did he turn his back on you so abruptly ? " " That 's a very painful question , Mr. Archer . " " I know it , and I 'm sorry . I 'm trying to understand how the Blackwell girl got into the picture . " " I ca n't explain it , " she said with a little sigh . " Suddenly there she was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ever mentioned her before she arrived ? "  | " No . They met here , you see . " " And he had no previous knowledge of her ? " " No . Are you implying that he was lying in wait for her or something equally melodramatic ? " " My questions do n't imply anything . They 're simply questions . Do you happen to know where they first met ? " " At a party at Helen Wilkinson 's . I was n't there , so I ca n't tell you who introduced whom to whom , or who was the aggressor , shall we say . I do know it was love at first sight . " She added dryly : " On her part . " " What about his part ? " Her clear brow knotted , and she looked almost ugly for a moment . " It 's hard to say . He dropped me like the proverbial hotcake when she hove into sight . He dropped his painting , too . he spent all his time with her for weeks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times I saw them together  --  he was still living here , but I arranged to see as little of him as possible  --  I got the impression that he was n't terribly attracted to her . " " What do you base that on ? " " Base is too definite a word for what I have to go on  --  the way he looked at her and the way he did n't look . He struck me as a man doing a job , doing it with rather cold efficiency . That may be wishful thinking on my part . " I doubted that it was . I 'd seen the lack of interest in his face the day before , in the Malibu house , when Harriet ran to him across the room . " I do n't believe you do much wishful thinking , Miss Castle . " " Do I not ? But they did n't seem to talk about each other , as people in love are supposed to . As Burke and I did when we were  --  together . " The ugly darkness caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much money her father had , and what a beautiful place he maintained at Lake Tahoe . Things like that , " she said contemptuously . " Just what was said about the place at Tahoe ? "  | " She described it to him in some detail , as if she was trying to sell a piece of real estate . I know I 'm being hard on her , but it was hard to listen to . She went on for some time about the great oaken beams , and the stone fireplace where you could roast an ox if you had an ox , and the picture window overlooking the lake . The disheartening thing was , Burke was intensely interested in her very materialistic little recital . " " Did she say anything about taking him there ? " " I believe she did . Yes , I remember she suggested that it would be an ideally secluded place for a honeymoon . " " This may be the most helpful thing you 've told me yet , " I said . " How did you happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tugged at one of her earrings in embarrassment . " I did n't mean to let that slip . I might as well confess , though , while I 'm confessing all . I eavesdropped on them . I did n't intend to do it , but he brought her to the studio several nights in a row , and my good intentions broke down . I had to know what they were saying to each other . " Her voice took on a satiric lilt : " So she was saying that her father had oodles of money and three houses , and Burke was drinking it in . Maybe he had an underprivileged childhood , who knows ? " " It 's a funny thing about con men , they often come from respectable well-heeled families " " He is n't a confidence man . He 's a good painter . " " I have to reserve my judgment , on both counts . It might be a good idea for you to reserve yours . " " I 've been trying , these last weeks . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " She moved her hands helplessly . " I 'd like to have a look at the studio you rented him . Would that be possible ? " " If you think it will help in any way . " On the far side of the courtyard , where a Volkswagen was parked for the night , a detached brick building with a huge window stood against the property wall . She unlocked thep94door and turned on a lamp inside . The big bare-walled room smelled of insecticide . Several unsittable-looking pigskincoveredchairs were distributed around the tile floor . A cot with its thin mattress uncovered stood in one corner . The only sign of comfort was the hand-woven drapes at the big window . " He lived frugally enough here , " I said . " Just like a monk in his cell . " Her inflection was sardonic . " Of course I 've stripped the place since he moved out . That was a week ago Sunday . " " He did n't fly to Los Angeles until the following day . " " I presume he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were spending nights together , were they ? " " Yes . I do n't know what went on in the course of the nights . You must n't think I spied on them persistently . I only broke down the once . " She folded her arms across her breasts and stood like a small monument , determined never to break down again . " You see me in my nakedness , Mr. Archer . I 'm the classic case of the landlady who fell in love with her star boarder and got jilted . " " I do n't see you in that light at all . " " What other light could you possibly see me in ? " " You 'd be surprised . Have you ever been married , Miss Castle ? " " Once . I left Vassar to get married , to a poet , of all things . It did n't work out . " " So you exiled yourself to Mexico ? " " It 's not that simple , and neither am I , " she said with a complicated smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this place . It 's as ancient as the hills and as new as the Garden of Eden  --  the real New World  --  and I love to be a part of it . " She added sadly , her mind revolving around a single pole : " I thought that Burke was beginning to feel the same . " I moved around the room and in and out of the bathroomp95at the rear . It was all bare and clean and unrevealing . I came back to her . " Did Damis leave much behind him , in the way of things ? " " He left no personal things , if that 's what you 're interested in . He had nothing when he came here and not much more when he left , except for his brushes . " " He came here with nothing at all ? " " Just the clothes he had on , and they were quite used up . I persuaded him to have a suit made in Guad . Yes , I paid for it . " " You did a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did he give you anything in return ? " " I did n't want anything from him . " " No keepsakes or mementos ? " ' She hesitated . " Burke gave me a little self-portrait . It 's only a sketch he tossed off . I asked him for it . " " May I see it ? " " If you like . " She locked up the studio and took me back across the courtyard to her bedroom . Framed in bamboo , the small black and white picture hung on the wall above her smooth bed . The sketch was too stylized to be a perfect likeness , and one eye was for some reason larger than the other , but Burke Damis was easily recognizable in it . He glared out somberly from a nest of crosshatched lines . Anne Castle stood and answered his look with defensive arms folded across her breasts . " I have a favor to ask you . A big one . " " You want the sketch , " she said . " I promise you 'll get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks like . You 've seen him , have n't you ? " " I 've seen him , but I do n't know who I 've seen . "  | " You think he 's using a false name ? " " I believe he 's using at least two aliases . Burke Damis is one . Quincy Ralph Simpson is another . Did he ever use the Simpsonname when he was with you ? " She shook her head . The movement left her face loose and expectant . " He came to Mexico under the Simpson name . He used it again when he left . There 's a strange thing about the name Quincy Ralph Simpson . The man who originally owned it is dead . " " Her head moved forward on her neck . " How did he die ? " " Of an icepick in the heart , two months ago , in a town near Los Angeles called Citrus Junction . Did Burke ever mentionCitrus Junction to you ? " " Never . " Her arms had fallen to her sides . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Are you trying to tell me that Burke killed him ? " " Burke , or whatever his name is , is the leading suspect in my book , so far the only one . He left the United States shortly after Simpson disappeared . It 's virtually certain he was using Simpson 's papers . " " Who was Simpson ? " " A little man of no importance who wanted to be a detec-tive . " " Was he after Burke for  --  some crime ? " Her voice had overtones and undertones . The dead man was walking in the attic again . The skeleton hung behind her half-shuttered eyes . " You brought up the subject of murder before , " I said . " Is that the crime you have in mind ? " She looked from me to the picture on the wall and back at me . She said miserably : " Did Burke kill a woman ? " " It 's not unlikely , " I said in a neutral tone . " Do you know who she was ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't tell me her name , or anything else about her . All he said  --  " She straightened up , trying to discipline her thoughts . " I 'll see if I can reconstruct exactly what he did say . It was our first night together . He 'd been drinking , and he was in a low mood . Post-coital tristesse , I believe they call it . " She was being cruel to herself . Her fingers worked in the coverlet of her bed . One of her hands , still working , went to her breast . She was no longer looking at me . " You were going to tell me what he said , Miss Castle . " " I ca n't . " " " You already have , in a sense . " " I should n't have spoken . Jilted landlady betrays demon lover . I did n't think that was my style . I 'm a hopeless creature , " she said , and flung herself sideways with her face in the pillow , her legs dragging on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of it , in the center of my body as well as in my head . A wave of feeling went through me ; I wanted to comfort her . But I kept my hands off . She had more memories than she could use , and so had I.The memory I was interested in came out brokenly , half smothered by the pillow . " He said he was bad luck to his women . I should have nothing to do with him if I liked my neck in one piece . He said that that had happened to his last one . " What happened to her ? " " She was choked to death . It was why he had to leave the States . " " That implies he was responsible for her death . Did he make a confession to you ? " " He did n't say it outright . It was more of a threat to me , or a warning . I suppose he was bullying me . But he never actuallyhurt me . He 's very strong , too . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeat the confession , or the threat ? " . " No , but I often thought of it afterward . I never brought it up , though . I was always a little afraid of him after that , Itp98did n't stop my loving him . I 'd love him no matter what he 'd done . " " Two murders take a lot of doing , and a very special kind of person to do them . " She detached her face from the comfort of the pillow and sat up , smoothing her skirt and then her hair . She was pale and shaken , as if she 'd been through a bout of moral nausea . " I ca n't believe that Burke is that kind of person . " " Women never can about the men they love . " " Just what evidence is there against him ? " " What I 've told you , and what you 've told me . " " But it does n't amount to anything . He might have been simply talking , with me . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . You asked me right off if murder was involved . And I have to tell you that it certainly is . I saw Ralph Simpson 's body just twenty-four hours ago . " " But you do n't know who the woman was ? " " Not yet . I have no information on Damis 's past life . It 's why I came here , and why I want to borrow your picture of him . " " What use will you make of it ? " " An acquaintance of mine is art critic on one of the L.A. papers . He knows the work of a lot of young painters , and quite a few of them personally . I want to show the sketch to him and see if he can put a name to your friend . " " Why do you think Burke Damis is n't his name ? " " If he 's on the run , as he seems to be , he would n't be using his own name . he entered Mexico under the Simpson alias , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence . Did you ever notice a shaving kit he had , in a leather case ? " " Yes . It was just about his only possession . " " Do you recall the initials on it ? " " I do n't believe I do . " " B.C. , ' " I said . " They do n't go with the name Burke Damis.  |p99I  'm very eager to know what name they do go with . That picturemay do it . " " You can have it , " she said , " and you do n't have to send it back . I should n't have hung it here anyway . It 's too much like self-flagellation . " She took it off its hook and gave it to me , talking me out of the room and herself out of her embarrassed pain . " I 'm a very self-flagellant type . But I suppose it 's better than having other people do it to you . And so very much more economical  --  it saves paying the middlemen . " " You talk a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't I ? Much too much too much . " But she was a serviceable woman . She gave me a bag of woven straw to carry the picture in , backed her Volkswagen out over my protests , and drove me out to the Wilkinsons ' lakefronthouse . It was past one but the chances were , she said , that Bill and his wife would still be up . They were late risers and late drinkers . She turned in at the top of their lane and kept her headlightson the barbed-wire gate while I unfastened it and closed it behind me . Then she gave a little toot on her horn and started back toward the village . I did n't expect to see her again , and I regretted it . Music DRIFTED from the house . It was old romantic music of the twenties , poignant and sweet as the jasmine on the air . The dooryard was thickly planted with shrubbery and trees . Wide terraces descended from it to the lake , which glimmered faintly in the middle distance . I bumped my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees the stars hung in the freshlyp100cleared sky like clusters of some smaller , brighter fruit too high to reach . I knocked on the heavy door . A woman spoke over the music : " Is that you , Bill ? " I did n't answer . After a minute 's waiting she opened the door . She was blonde and slim in something diaphanous . She also wore in her right hand a clean-looking .38 revolver pointed at my stomach . " What do you want ? " " A little talk . My name is Archer and I 'm only here overnightand I realize this is a poor time to come bothering you  --  " " You have n't told me what you want . " " I 'm a private detective investigating a crime . " " We do n't have crime here , " she said sharply . " This crime occurred up north . " " What makes you think that I know anything about it ? " " I 'm here to ask you , is all . " She moved back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light and let me see you . " I stepped into a room so huge that its far corners were in darkness . Gershwin spilled in a nostalgic cascade from a massivehi-fi layout against one wall . The blonde woman was heavily made up in an old-fashioned way , as if she had been entertaining ghosts . Her triangular face had the taut immobilitythat plastic surgery often leaves behind . She looked at my feet and swept her eyes up my body like searchlights , half occulted by eye shadow . I recognized the way she used her eyes . I 'd seen it a dozen times before through the fallout of old late movies , and earlier still , when I was a juvenile patron of the Long Beach movie houses and she was a western leading lady smirking and ogling her way out of triangular relationships with horses . I reached deep for her movie name , but I could n't quite dredge it up.  | " You 're fairly pretty , " she said . " Is n't that Claude Stacy 's sweater you 're wearing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got rained on . " " I gave him that sweater . Are you a friend of Claude 's ? " " Not an intimate one . " " That 's good . You do n't look his type . Do you like women ? " " Put the gun away and I 'll give you a truthful answer , " I said with the necessary smile . She responded with a smile of her own , a 1929 smile that rested on her mouth like a footnote to history . " Do n't let the gun bother you . I learned to handle a gun when I was playing in westerns . My husband insists I keep it handy when I 'm alone at night . Which I usually am . " She laid the revolver down on a table near the door and turned back to me . " You have n't told me if you like women or not . " " I like individual women . I 've liked you , for example , for a longer time than either of us would care to admit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back to me . " You 're Helen Holmes , are n't you ? " She lit up coldly and brightly , like a marquee . " You remember me . I thought everyone had forgotten . " " I was a fan , " I said , spreading it not too thick . " How nice ! " She clenched her hands at her shoulders and jumped a few inches off the floor , with both feet , her smile immobile . " For that you may sit you down and I 'll pour you a drink and tell you anything you want to know . Except about me . Name your poison . " " Gin and tonic , since you 're so kind . " " One gin and tonic coming up . " She turned on a gilt chandelier which hung like a barbaric treasure among the ceiling beams . The room was like an auctioneer'swarehouse , crowded with furniture of various periods and countries . Against a distant wall stood an ornately carvedp102bar , backed by shelves of bottles , with half a dozen leathercoveredstools in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's cozier . " I sat and watched her mix my drink . For herself she compoundedsomething out of tequila and grenadine , with coarse salt sprinkled around the rim of the glass . She stayed behind the bar to drink it , leaning on her forearms and exposing her bosom like a barmaid favoring a customer . " I wo n't waste time beating around the bush . I 'm interested in Burke Damis . You know him , Mrs. Wilkinson ? " " Slightly . He is , or was , a friend of my husband 's . " " Why do you put it in the past tense ? " " They had a quarrel , some time before Mr. Damis left here . " " What about ? " " You ask very direct questions . " " I do n't have time for my usual subtlety . " " That must be something to experience . " " Oh , it is . What did they quarrel about ? " " Me , if you have to know . Poor little old me " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were going to kill each other , honestly . But Bill contented himself with burning the picture . That way he got back at both of us . " She raised one hand like a witness . " Now do n't ask me for doing what . There was n't any what . It 's just that Bill is very insecure in our relationship . " " iie burned the Portrait of an Unknown Woman ' ? " " Yes , and I have n't forgiven him for it , " she said , as though this were proof of character . " He broke up the frame and tore the canvas and put the whole thing in the fireplace and set fire to it . Bill can be quite violent sometimes . " She sipped her drink and licked the salt from her lips with a pale pointed tongue . She reminded me of a cat , not a domestic cat , but one of the larger breeds that could stalk men . Her bright lips seemed to be savoring the memory of violence.  | " Did Damis know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It broke him up . He wept actual tears , can you imagine ? " " I wonder why . " " It was his best picture , he said . I liked it , too . " " I heard he 'd tried to buy it back . " " He did , but I would n't part with it " Between the shadowedlids her eyes were watchful . " Who else have you been talking to ? " " Various people around the village . " " Claude Stacy ? " " No . Not yet . " " Why are you so interested in that particular picture ? " " I 'm interested in everything Damis does . " " You mentioned a crime that occurred up north . Do you want to let down your back hair about it ? I 've been letting down my back hair . " I told her what had happened to Quincy Ralph Simpson . She looked somehow disappointed , as if she 'd been expecting something more lurid . " This is all new to me , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simpson . " " Let 's get back to the picture then . Damis called it a portrait . Did he ever say who the subject of it was ? " " He never did , " she said shortly . " Do you have any ideas ? " She shrugged her shoulders and made a stupid face , with her mouth turned down at the corners . " You must have had a reason for buying the painting and wanting to keep it . Your husband cared enough about it to burn it . " " I do n't know who the woman was , " she said , too forcefully . " I think you do . " " Think away . You 're getting rather boring . It 's late , and Ip104have a headache . " She drew her fingers across her forehead . " Why do n't you drink up and go ? " I left my drink where it was on the bar between us . " I 'm sorry if I pressed too hard . I did n't mean to  --  " " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the end of the bar , licking her lips . " Come on , I 'll let you out . " It had been a very quick party . Reluctantly I followed her to the door . " I was hoping to ask you some questions about Harriet Blackwell . I understand Damis met her here at your house . " " So what ? " she said , and pulled the door open . " Out . " She slammed it behind me . In the dooryard I bumped my head on the same low-hanging fruit . I picked it  --  it was a mango  --  and took it along with me as a souvenir . It was a long walk back , but I rather enjoyed it . It gave me a chance to think , among other things about Helen Holmes Wilkinson . Our rather tenuous relationship , based on Claude Stacy 's sweater and my remembering her movie name , had broken down over the identity of the woman in the burned portrait . I would give odds that she knew who the woman was and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Helen 's own connection with Damis . Headlights approached me , coming very fast from the direction of the village . They belonged to a beetle-shaped Porsche which swerved in long arcs from one side of the road to the other . I had to slide into the ditch to avoid being run over . As the Porsche went by I caught a glimpse of the driver 's face , pale under flying dark hair . I threw my mango at him . The clock chimed two quarters  --  half-past two  --  as I struggledthrough the village to the posada . In the room behind the desk , Claude Stacy was sleeping in his clothes on a mohair couch . It was a couch with one high end , the kind psychiatristsuse , and he was curled up on it in foetal position . I shook him . He grimaced and snorted like a huge old baby being born into a world he never made.  | " What is it ? " " I met a friend of yours tonight . Helen Wilkinson . She mentionedyou . " " Did she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket and ran it through his thinning hair . " I hope it was complimen-tary . " " Very , " I lied . He basked in the imaginary compliment . " Oh , Helen and I get along . If Bill Wilkinson had n't got to her first I might have thought of marrying her myself . " He thought about it now . " She used to be in pictures , you know , and she saved her money . I did some acting at one time myself . But I did n't hang on to any money . " " " What does Bill Wilkinson do for a living ? " " Nothing . He must be twenty years younger than Helen is , " he said by way of explanation . " You 'd never know it , she 's so beautifully preserved . And Bill has let himself go frightfully . He used to be a Greek god , I mean it . " " Have you known him long ? " " Years and years . It 's through him I got to know Helen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after his folks stopped sending him money . I would n't say he married her for her money , but he married where money is . Tennyson . " " Stacy giggled . " It drives him out of his mind when Helen even looks at another man . " " She looks at other men ? " " I 'm afraid she does . She was interested in me at one time . " He flushed with vanity . " Of course I would n't steal another fellow 's wife . Bill knows he can trust me . Bill and I have been buddy-buddy for years . " " Have you seen him tonight ? " " No , I have n't . I think he went to a party in Guadalajara . He has some very good connections . His family are very wellknownpeople in Texas . " " Does he drive a Porsche ? "  | " If you can call it driving . His driving is one reason he had to leave Texas . " " I can believe it . He almost ran me down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some night he 's going to end up in the ditch with a broken neck . And maybe I 'll marry Helen after all , who knows ? " The prospect failed to cheer him . " I need a drink , old chap . Will you have one with me ? " " All right . Drinking seems to be the favorite indoor sport around here . " He looked at me to see if I was accusing him of being a drunk . I smiled . He gave me a Mexican-type shrug and got a bottle of Bacardi out from under the high end of the couch . He poured some into paper cups from a dispenser that hung on the wall beside the bottled water . I added water to mine . " Salad , " he said . " If you do n't mind my asking , how did you happen to run into Helen Wilkinson ? " " I went to see her . " " Just like that ? " " I happen to be a private investigator . " He sat bolt upright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wondered what old scandal had the power to galvanize him . " I thought you were a tourist , " he said resentfully . " I 'm a detective , and I came here to investigate a man who calls himself Burke Damis . I think he stayed with you for a night or two . " " One night , " Stacy said . " So it 's really true about him , after all ? I hated to believe it  --  he 's such a fine-looking chap . " " You hated to believe what ? " " That he murdered his wife . Is n't that why you 're after him ? " With the aid of a little rum and water I made a quick adjustment . " These rumors get around . Where did you happen to pick that one up ? "  | " It was going the rounds , as you say . I think it started when Bill Wilkinson told somebody at The Place that he was going to report Damis as an undesirable alien . " Stacy sounded like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collectednotable sayings or pictures or women . " The government has been bearing down on undesirables , rounding them up and sending them back across the border . Like wetbacks in reverse . " " And Wilkinson turned Damis in ? " " I do n't believe he actually did , but he threatened to . Which is probably why Damis got out in a hurry . So he really is one jump ahead of the law ? " " A long jump , " I said . " This rumor interests me . What exactlywas said ? " " Simply that Damis  --  which was n't his real name  --  was wanted for the murder of his wife . " " How do you know it is n't his real name ? " " I do n't know anything . It was all part of the rumor . I pesteredBill and Helen for more details , but they refused to talk  --  " " They know more details , do they ? " " I would say so . " " Where did they get them ? " " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made their border trip last May and spent a week or so in California . That 's when the murder occurred , is n't it ? Maybe they read about it in the newspapers . But if they knew all about it , I ca n't understand why they would get chummy with the man . The three of them were very buddy-buddy for a while , before Bill turned against him . Helen got too interested in Damis . " " But Damis had a girl of his own . " Or two . Or three . He smiled indulgently . " That would n't stop Helen . " " Do you know the girl he left here with  --  Harriet Black-well ? "  | " I met her once , at a party . " " Where did Damis meet her ? " " Same party , at Helen Wilkinson 's . Helen told me he asked her to invite her . " " Damis asked Helen to invite Harriet to the party ? " " That 's what I said . " " So that he could meet Harriet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear . " The interview was beginning to depress me . Stacy 's eyes had a feeding look , as if he lived on these morsels and scraps of other people 's lives . Perhaps I feared a similar fate for myself . He poured himself more Bacardi and offered me some . I turned it down , politely . If I wanted to get back to California tomorrow  --  and now I was determined to  --  I had some further legwork to do tonight . " Tell me , Mr. Stacy , is there a taxi in the village ? " " There 's a man who drives people . You 'd have a frightful time routing him out at three in the morning . Why ? " " I have to get out to the Wilkinsons , and I do n't feel like walking it again . " " I 'll drive you . " " You 're very hospitable . " " Think nothing of it . This is exciting for me . I 'll take you on one condition , that you do n't tell Bill or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is important to me , you know . " " Sure . " He brought his battered Ford around to the entrance and drove me out the lake road . Roosters were crowing in the dark countryside . Stacy parked at the head of the Wilkinsons ' lane and let me go in by myself . The Wilkinsons were having an argument which was loud enough to penetrate the walls . I stood outside the front door and listened to it . She called him an alcoholic . He said she could n't talk to ap109Charro like that . She said it took more than a Charro hat to make a Charro , that he was a Charro like she was a member of the DAR . He called her a sexoholic . She told him if he did n't watch his lip she 'd divorce him and turn him loose to beg in the streets . He announced that she 'd be doing him a favor , since marriage to her was uphill work at best . The argument simmered down after a while , so that I could hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dead dark middle of the night . I balled up the rest of my energy in my fist and knocked on the door . Wilkinson answered it this time . He was a big man in his thirties who looked older . His Mexican clothes and haircut made him seem to be metamorphosing under my eyes , changinginto something that was strange even to himself . He had alcohol in him , red in the eye , sour on the breath , thick on the tongue . " I do n't know you . Go ' way . " " Just give me a minute . I 'm a private detective , and I flew down from L.A. to do some checking on Burke Damis . I heard you were a friend of his . " " You heard wrong . He came sucking around for free drinks . Once I caught onto him , I cut him dead . But dead . " Wilkinson had a nasty whining drawl . His red eyes glared with something stronger than drink , perhaps a touch of madness . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wormed himself into my good graces so he could get next to my wife . I do n't stand for that . " He made a sideways slicing gesture . The edge of his hand struck the doorframe . He put the edge of his hand in his mouth . " I heard a rumor that he killed his own wife . " " That was no rumor . We were in San Francisco in the spring , and I saw it in the paper with these eyes  --  the dead woman 's picture and all . It said that he shtrangled her . But we didn'tp110know who he was when he came here worming his way . We did n't know till we saw the picture he painted . " " Was it a portrait of his wife ? " " Thass right . Helen reckonized her face , poor little woman . That snake-in-the-grass shtrangled her with his own hands . " Wilkinson made clutching motions , as though he was havinga waking dream of strangling or being strangled . His wife called from somewhere out of sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you talking to ? " " Man from L.A. He says that he 's a detective . " She ran the length of the living room to his side . " Do n't talk to him . " " I 'll talk to him if I like , " he said with the look of a spoiled and sullen child . " I 'll put the kibosh on Damis once and for all . " You stay out of it . " " You were the one that got me into it . If you had n't tried to blackmail him into  --  " " Be quiet . You 're a fool . " They faced each other in a rage that created a vacuum around them . He was twice as big as she was , and almost twice as young , but she held her anger better . Her taut and shining face was expressionless . " Listen to me , Bill . This man was here an hour or so ago . I had to ask him to leave . " " Whaffor ? " " He made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across her bosom . His attention slopped heavily in my direction . " Izzat true ? " " Do n't believe her . " " Now he 's calling me a liar . " Her white triangular face was at his shoulder . " Are you going to let him get away with it ? " He threw a wild fist at my head . I let it go by and hit him in the body . He sat down holding his belly with both hands . I should n't have hit him . He retched.  | " Why you dirty lousy son , " the woman said . She picked her revolver off the table and fired it at me . The bullet tugged at a loose fold of Stacy 's sweater , close to my side . I turned and ran . IN THE MORNING , the sudden morning , Stacy drove me to the airport . He would n't let me pay him for the service , or for the double hole in his sweater . He said it would make a conversation piece . But he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend of his who managed a small hotel in Laguna Beach . I was to tell the man that Claude was doing all right , and there were no hard feelings . I tottered on board the plane and slept most of the way to Los Angeles . We landed shortly after one o'clock . It was hot , hotter than it had been in Mexico . Smog lay over the city like the lid of a pressure cooker . I immured myself in an outside phone booth and made severalcalls . Colonel Blackwell had had no word from Harriet since she drove off with Damis the day before yesterday . It was possible , he agreed , that they had gone to Tahoe . His lodge there was situated on the lake , on the Nevada side of State Line . I cut his anxious questions short with a promise to come and see him at his house . Then I called Arnie Walters in Reno . He ran a detective agency which covered that end of Nevada . Arnie 's wife and partner answered the phone . Phyllis Waltershad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't quite hide her exuberant femininity . " How are you , Lew ? Where have you been keeping your-self ? "  | " All over the map . Last night , for instance , I spent a week in Mexico . " " You do get around . Arnie 's out . Is it business or just social ? " " Urgent business . You 'd better record this . " " All right . Go ahead . " I gave her a description of Harriet and Damis and asked to have them looked for in the Tahoe and Reno area , with specialattention to the Blackwell lodge and the wedding chapels . " If Arnie or one of his men runs into Damis , with or without the girl , I want Damis held . " " We ca n't detain him , you know that . " " You can make a citizen 's arrest and turn him over to the nearest cop . IIe 's a fugitive from a murder rap . " " Who did he murder ? " " His wife , apparently . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meantime Arnie should be warned that the man is dangerous . " " Will do " " Good girl . I 'll get back to you later , Phyllis . " I called the photographer with whom I 'd left my film of Damis 's painting . The slides were ready . Finally , I called the art critic Manny Meyer . He said he 'd be home for the next hour , and he was willing to look at my exhibits . I picked up the slides in Santa Monica and drove up Wilshire to Westwood . Manny lived in one of the big new apartment buildings on the hill . The windows of his front room overlooked the UCLA campus . It was the room of a man who loved art and not much besides . Dozens of books had overflowed from the bookshelves onto the furniture , including the closed top of the baby grand piano . The walls were literally paneled with nineteenth-century reproductions and contemporary originals . Entering the room was like stepping into the interior of Manny 's head . He was a small man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleepy behind his glasses . They regardedp113me with quiet waiting patience , as if I was the raw material of art . " Sit down , Lew . " He waved his hand at the encumbered chairs . I remained standing . " You would like me to identify a style , is that the problem ? It is n't always so easy . You know how many painters there are ? I bet you I could find five hundred within a radius of a mile . A thousand , maybe . " He smiled slightly . " All of them geniuses of the first water . " " This particular genius did a self-portrait , which ought to make it easier for you . " " If I have ever seen him . " I got the bamboo-framed sketch out of my straw bag and showed it to Manny . He held it in his hands , studying it with concentration , like a man peering into a mirror for traces of illness . " I believe I have seen him . Let me look at the transparencies . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the window one at a time . " Yes . I know him . He has his own style , though there has been some change in it , perhaps some deterioration . That would n't be surprising . " When he turned from the window his eyes were sorrowful . " His name is Bruce Campion . I saw some of his work at a showing of young artists in San Francisco last year . I also met him briefly . I hear since then that he has come to grief , that he is wanted by the police , for murdering his wife . It was in the San Francisco papers . I 'm surprised you did n't see it . " " I do n't take the San Francisco papers . " " Perhaps you should . You could have saved yourself time and trouble . " He gathered together the sketch and the slides and handed them back to me . " I suppose you 're hot on his heels ? "  | " On the contrary , the trail is cold . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How good ? " " So good that I do n't greatly care what he did to his wife , " he said softly . " You live in a world of stark whites and blacks . My world is one of shadings , and the mechanism of punishmentis anathema to me . An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth ' is the law of a primitive tribe . If we practiced it to the letter we would all be eyeless and toothless . I hope he eludes you , and goes on painting . " " The danger is that he 'll go on killing . " " I doubt it . According to my reading , murderers are the criminals least likely to repeat their offense . Now if you 'll excuseme I have a show to cover . " Meyer 's parting smile was gentle . He did n't believe in evil . His father had died in Buchenwald , and he did n't believe in evil . I DROVE ACROSS to Sunset , and up the winding road to Blackwell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , brushing aside a little maid in uniform . His eyes moved on my face like a blind man 's eyes trying to glean a ray of light . " You 've found out something ? " " The news is not good . " His hands came out and clutched both of my arms above the elbows . With the mindless automatism of St. Vitus 's dance , he started to shake me . I pushed him away . " Calm down and I 'll tell you about it . " " How can you expect me to be calm ? My daughter has been gone for forty-eight hours . I should have used force top115stop them . I should have shot him dead at my feet  --  " " That 's nonsense , " I said . " We need to talk . Can we go in and sit down ? " He blinked like a man waking up from troubled sleep . " Yes . Of course . " The drawing room he took me into was furnished with Empirepieces which gave it a museumlike atmosphere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of them , of an officer in the uniform of the War of 1812 , had the weight and finish of a Gilbert Stuart . Blackwell sat in an armchair under it , as if to call attention to the family resemblance . I parked myself uninvited on a red divan with a curved back , and gave him a brief rundown on my Mexican trip . " I 've put together certain facts I uncovered there with others that cropped up here and come to a definite conclusion about Damis . He 's a wanted man traveling under more than one alias . His real name is Bruce Campion , and he 's wanted for murder . " Blackwell 's jaw moved slackly . I could see the pale insides of his mouth . " What did you say ? " " Damis 's real name is Campion . He 's wanted in San Mateo County for strangling his wife last spring . " Blackwell 's face looked like cracked plaster . Consciousness withdrew from his eyes , leaving them blank as glass . He slipped from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His white hair spilled like a sheaf on the old rose carpet . I went to the door and called the maid . She came trotting and skidding on the parquetry , her excited little breasts bobbingunder her uniform . She let out a muffled scream when she saw the fallen man . " Is he dead ? " " He fainted , honey . Bring some water , and a washcloth . " She was back in thirty seconds , half spilling a pan of waterp116on the carpet . I sprinkled some of it on Blackwell 's face and swabbed his long forehead . His eyes came open , recognized me , remembered what I had told him . He groaned , and tried to faint again . I slapped him with the wet cloth . The little maid stood and watched me with wide blue eyes , as if I was committing lese majesty . " What 's your name ? " I asked her . " Letty . " " Where 's Mrs. Blackwell , Letty ? " " She does hospital work one day a week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try and get in touch with her . " " All right . Should I call the doctor , do you think ? " " He does n't need a doctor unless he has a heart history . " " Heart history ? " she repeated like a lip reader . " Has he ever had a heart attack , or a stroke ? " Blackwell answered me himself , in a shamed voice : " I 've never even fainted before . " He sat up laboriously , resting his back against the chair . " I 'm not as young as I am  --  as I was . What you told me came as a fearful shock . " " It does n't mean that Harriet is dead , you know . " " Does n't it ? I must have jumped to that conclusion . " He noticed the young maid standing over him . He smoothed his hair and tried to compose his face . " You may go now , Miss Flavin . Be good enough to take that pot of water with you . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She picked it up and marched out . Blackwell levered himself into the chair . " We have to do something , " he said unsteadily . " I 'm glad you feel that way . I 've already alerted detectives in the Reno area . I think we should extend the search to the whole Southwest , if not the entire country . That will cost a good deal of money . " He extended his limp fingers . " It does n't matter . Anything . " " It 's time to bring in the police , too , give them all we knowp117and build a fire under them . I suggest you start off by talking to Peter Colton . " " Yes . I 'll do that . " He rose shakily as if the weight of his years had fallen on him all at once . " Give me a minute . My mind is n't quite clear yet . " " Better get yourself a drink . In the meantime , I have an important call to make . May I use one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isobel 's sitting room . You can be private there . " It was a small pleasant room whose French doors opened onto a private terrace . The furniture was well used , shabby rather than antique . It did n't match the nineteenth-century grandeur of the drawing room , and I guessed that Isobel Blackwell had saved it from some less opulent period of her life  --  a period on which she had n't turned her back . I sat at the plain oak desk , called the Hall of Justice in RedwoodCity , and asked the switchboard operator for Captain Royal . He was San Mateo County 's homicide chief , and I had met him on an earlier case . " What can I do for you ? " he said , after a few preliminaries . " I have some information about Bruce Campion , who is allegedto have strangled his wife last May in your bailiwick . Is that correct ? " " Correct . It happened the night of May fifth . What 's your information ? " I heard the small click as Royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ click , that sounded like a receiverbeing lifted . " I 've been tracing Campion 's movements , " I said . " He flew from Los Angeles to Guadalajara on May twentieth . " " The airport police were supposed to be watching for him , " Royal said impatiently . " He used false papers and an alias  --  Quincy Ralph Simpson . Does that name mean anything to you ? " " It does . I found out yesterday that Simpson was icepickedp118in Citrus Junction two months ago . You telling me Campion did it ? " " The possibility suggests itself , " I said . " He must have been carrying Simpson 's identification when he crossed the border . Simpson was almost certainly dead by then . " " Is Campion still in Mexico ? " " No . He spent two months there under the name Burke Damis , in Ajijic on Lake Chapala , where he was eventually recognized as a wanted man . In the meantime he 'd got a visiting American girl named Harriet Blackwell to fall for him . Nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles . Campion used the Simpson alias again . Then he switched back to Damis , and spent a week as a guest in the Black-well 's beach house near Malibu . It 's possible the Blackwell girl knows something about his past and is protecting him . Campionhas her hypnotized , but she could hardly miss the change of names . " " Is she with him now ? " " I hope not . But she probably is . The two of them left her father 's house forty-eight hours ago after a serious altercation which involved threats of shooting . They took off in her car , a new green Buick Special . " I gave him the license number . " Who did the threatening ? " " IIer father , Mark Blackwell . He 's only a retired Colonel but he has money , and I imagine he pulls weight in some circles . I 'm calling from his house in Bel Air now . " " Is Blackwell your client ? " " Yes . My immediate job is to find the girl and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot . She 's a big blonde , short-haired , aged twenty-four , about six feet in her shoes , with a tall girl 's stoop . Expensively dressed , good figure , but face a little disfigured by a bony protuberance over the eyes . It 's a genetic defect  --  " " What ? " " The bony eyebrows are a family trait . The old man hasp119'em , and all the ancestors . Harriet wears dark glasses part of the time . I assume you know what Campion looks like . " " I have him memorized , " Royal said . " Picture ? " " No picture . That 's how he got across the border . " " I have one . I 'll try to get a copy of it into your hands today . Now there 's a possibility that Campion and the girl have doubled back toward Mexico . Nevada is another possibility . They were talking about getting married , and it 's an easy state to get married in . They may be married now , or representing themselves as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Royal said , " if she knows what he did to his wife and still wants to marry him . " " I 'm not suggesting she knows about the wife . He probablyfaked a story to explain the aliases , and she would be easily taken in . She 's crazy in the sense that she 's crazy about him . Also , she 's in active revolt against her father . She 's twentyfour , as I said , and he treats her as if she was four . " " Is n't twenty-four a little late for the big rebellion ? " " Harriet has been living under military occupation . She 's a fugitive from injustice . " " So she takes up with a fugitive from justice . I 've seen it happen before . " Royal paused . " How much danger do you think she 's in ? " " You 'd know more about that than I do , Captain . It depends on Campion 's motivation . Harriet 's due to come into money on her twenty-fifth birthday , so if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the next six months . Did Campion kill his wife for money ? " " There was n't any money , so far as we know . We have n't been able to uncover any motive at all . Which means he could be off his rocker . A lot of these creeps who call themselves artists are nuts . He lived like a bum in a remodeled garage near Luna Bay , everything in one room . " Royal 's voice was scornful . " Did he have a record of irrational behavior ? "  | " I would n't know . He has a record , period . A year 's hard labor and a dishonorable discharge for assaulting an officer during the Korean War . That 's all we 've been able to dig up on him , but it shows a history of violence . Also he was n't gettingalong with his wife . Put the two together , it 's all you need in the way of motive . " " Tell me about the wife . " " That can wait , ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on the wires . " " You could give me a quick rundown . " Royal said in a clipped , toneless voice : " Her name was Dolly Stone Campion , age about twenty , pretty little blonde , not so pretty when we found her . According to our info , Campionpicked her up on the South Shore of Tahoe last summer , and married her in Reno in September . It must have been a marriage of inconvenience  --  Dolly was three months pregnant at the time . At least their child was born in March , six months after the wedding . Two months after that he knocked her off . " " Tahoe keeps cropping up , " I said . " The Blackwells have a lodge there , and Q. R. Simpson spent some time at the lake in May , shortly before he was murdered . " " What was he doing there ? " " I have a hunch he was working on the Dolly Campion case . What happened to her baby , by the way ? " " Her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all day , and I have work to do . A lot more work than I had before , " he added wryly . " Will you be coming up this way ? " " As soon as I can make it . " Which was n't soon . I made a second call to Arnie Walters 's office in Reno . I wanted to pass the word on Campion and ask Arnie to add more men to the search . He already had , Phyllis told me , because Campion and Harriet Blackwell had been seen in State Line the previous night . That was all so far . I dropped the receiver into its cradle . When I picked it up , it felt appreciably heavier . I called the airport and made ap121reservation on the next flight to Reno . They were going to have to give me flying pay . As I was getting up from the desk , I noticed a folded newspaperwhich lay on the back of it . " San Mateo Man , " I spelled out upside down . I unfolded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Junction News-Beacon . The full headline ran across the top of the page : " San Mateo Man Killed Here : Police Suspect Gang Murder . " The story under it was poorly written and poorly printed , and it told me nothing I did n't already know . I still had the paper in my hands when Blackwell came into the room . He looked like the ghost of one of his ancestors . " What are you doing with that newspaper ? " " I was wondering how it got into your house . " " That 's no concern of yours , I should think . " He snatched it away from me and rolled it up small . " A number of things are no concern of yours . For example , I 'm not paying out good money to have myself and my daughter slandered to police-men . " " I thought I heard somebody on another extension . Does everyone in your household eavesdrop on everyone else ? " " That 's an insulting remark . I demand that you withdraw it . " Blackwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled newspaper vibrated in his hand . He slapped his thigh with it , as if it was a swagger stick or a riding crop . He looked ready to strike me with it , and challenge me to a duel . " I ca n't change facts , Colonel . If you do n't like what you heard , you could have stopped listening . " " Are you telling me what to do in my own house ? " " It does sound like it , does n't it ? " " Then get out of my house . Get out , do you hear ? " " They hear you in Tarzana . Do n't you want your daughter found ? "  | " We 'll find her without your help . You 're fired . " " You 've already had my help , " I said . " You owe me three hundred and fifty dollars for time and expenses . " " I 'll write you a check , now . " " You can stop payment on a check . I need cash . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Blackwell would come to his senses , as he had once before . Though I could n't knuckle under to him , I was eager to hold on to the case . It was beginning to break , and a breaking case to a man in my trade is like a love affair you ca n't stay away from , even if it tears your heart out daily . " I do n't have that much in the house , " he was saying . " I 'd have to cash a cheek at the hotel . " " Do that . I 'll wait here . " " Outside , " he said in a monitory tone . " I do n't want you prying around in here . You can wait in your car . " I went down the hall and out , with Blackwell making shooingmotions at my kidneys . He backed his black Cadillac out of the garage and drove away down the hill . I put in a bad ten minutes deciding where to go from here . It would have to be Tahoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own time . The mourning dove had returned to the television antenna . IIe sat there still and perfect as a heraldic bird . I said hoohooto him and got a response , hoo-hoo , and I felt better . Isobel Blackwell , driving a small foreign car , came into the driveway from the road . I got out of my car to meet her . Her face looked wan in the sunlight , but she made herself smile at me . " Mr. Archer ! What a pleasant surprise . " " Did n't Letty get in touch with you ? " " I left the hospital early . I 've been concerned about Mark . " " You have some reason to be . He had a fainting spell a while ago . Then he had a yelling spell . " " Mark fainted ? " " I gave him some information that hit him hard . "  |p123She  ducked out of her little car and thrust her face up towardmine . " Something has happened to Harriet . " " We do n't know that . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wandering around Nevada with the man who calls himself Damis . His actual name is Bruce Campion , and he 's wanted in Redwood City for murdering his wife . " It took her a minute to absorb this . Then she turned toward the house and noticed the empty garage . " Where is Mark ? " " He went down to the hotel to get some money to pay me off . He fired me . " " What on earth for ? " " The Colonel and I have had it , I 'm afraid . We 've both had too much Army , in different ways  --  the worm's-eye view and the god's-eye view . " " But I do n't understand . You mean you wo n't go on with him ? " " I 'd have to be asked . Which is n't very likely . " " I know how difficult he can be , " she said in a rush of feeling . " Tell me exactly what the trouble was . " " He listened in on a telephone conversation I had with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his treatment of Harriet . He did n't like them . " " And that 's all ? " " All there is on the surface . Of course he was thrown by the information I gave him on Damis-Campion . He could n't handle it , so he threw it back . He thinks that I 'm what hurts him . " She nodded . " That 's his standard pattern . It 's been getting worse since this began . I 'm worried about him , Mr. Archer . I do n't know how he 's going to survive . " " It 's Harriet 's survival I 'm worried about . She and Campion were seen at State Line last night , and I have some Reno detectives on their trail . We have a chance to take him and rescue her , if we can stay with it . "  |p124Her  whole body reacted to my words . She clutched her handbag to her breast as if it was a child she could protect . " The man is a murderer , you say ? " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer to me . Her hand lit on my wrist , and she said in a voice as low as a mourning dove 's : " You said you 'd have to be asked . I 'm asking you . Will you take me for a client ? " " Nothing would suit me better . " " Then it 's a contract . " Her hand slid from my wrist to my fingers , and squeezed them . " It would be a good idea to let me tell Mark about this . In my own time , in my own way . " " I agree . " She went into the house and came out and gave me money and went in again . Blackwell 's Cadillac rolled into the drive . He climbed out and gave me money . His color was better , and I could smell fresh whisky on him . He must have had a quick one or two at the hotel . He looked at me as though he wanted to speak , but he did n't say a word . ARNIE WALTERS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short broad man in his early fifties who looked like somebody you 'd see selling tips at a race track . But he had the qualities of a first-rate detective : honesty , imagination , curiosity , and a love of people . Ten or twelve years in Reno had left him poor and uncorrupted . On the way to State Line he filled me in on the situation there . A handyman named Sholto , who kept an eye on several lakeside houses for their absentee owners , had talked to Har/riet the night before . She had come to Sholto 's house to get the key to her father 's lodge , and specifically asked him not to tell her father she was there . Campion had been with her , but stayed in the car , her car . " Apparently , " Arnie went on , " they spent the night , or part of the night , in the lodge . There 's some dirty dishes on the sinkboard , recently used . Also there 's some indication they 're coming back , or planned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have the place staked out . " " What about her suitcase ? " " Gone . So is her car . " " I do n't like that . " Arnie shifted his eyes from the road to my face . " You seriouslythink he brought her up here to do her in ? " " It 's a possibility that ca n't be ruled out . " " What were the circumstances of the other killing ? The wife . " " He strangled her . I do n't have the details yet . " " Did he stand to gain by her death ? " " The San Mateo police think not . The only motive they 've come up with is incompatibility , or words to that effect . Evidentlyit was a forced marriage : the girl was about three months pregnant at the time . He married her in Reno last September , by the way , which means that this is n't new territoryto Campion . " " You think he 's repeating a pattern ? " " Something like that . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has me baffled . " " I never heard you say that before , Lew . Not out loud . " " Maybe I 'm slipping . I do n't pretend to be attuned to the artistic mind . Campion is a good painter , according to a critic who knows what he 's talking about . " " You think he could be psycho ? A lot of psychos magnetize the broads. "  | " The psycho broads , " I said . " It 's hard to tell about Campion . He had himself in control both times I saw him . The second time was under severe provocation . Harriet 's father threatened him with a shotgun , and he stood up to it like a little man . But then psychos can be actors . " " Bad actors . Is he as good-looking as the description says ? " " Unfortunately yes . I brought along a picture of him . It 's a self-sketch , not a photograph , but it 's a good-enough likeness to circularize . I want it back after you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the car . I 'll get it around to our informers and have it posted in the lookout galleries in the clubs . Sooner or later he 'll show , if lie 's hiding out in this area . You realize he could be long gone by now , and so could the girl . " We drove in silence for a while , through country wooded with evergreens . The trees parted at one point , and I caught a first glimpse of the lake . It was the height of the season , and outboards were rioting in the afternoon sun . Skiers drove their plows of spray in eccentric furrows . I could n't help rememberingthat Tahoe was deep and cold . Harriet could be long gone , far down , sheathed in black bottom water . IIer father 's lodge stood among dense trees at the end of a frost-cracked asphalt lane . It was an imposing timbered buildingwith half-walls of native stone . Concrete steps with iron railings zigzagged down from the terrace to the shore . A man stepped out of the trees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arnie introduced him as Jim Hanna , one of his men . The three of us went inside . Campion 's brown suitcase was standing in the hallway undera moose head . I reached for it , but Arnie stopped me . " It 's a waste of time , Lew . Nothing in it but some painting equipment and shaving kit and some old clothes . He was hun-gry . " The great front room was furnished with handsome rustic pieces , Navajo rugs , animal skins , animal heads staring down at us with sad glass eyes . The picture window that Harrietp127had described to Campion framed blue sky and blue lake . Her pitch had been too successful , I was thinking . We went through the other rooms , including the six upstairs bedrooms . Their mattresses lay bare . A closet in the hallway was full of sheets and pillow slips and towels , none of which had been used . I left Arnie and Hanna in the house and went down the concretesteps to the shore . The lake had been pulling at me since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year , and a swath of gravel sloped down from the foot of the steps . I took a walk along the edge of the gravel . Speedboat waves lapped at the stones and brightened them . I was looking for some trace of Harriet ; yet I was shocked when I found it . It was something that looked like a scrap of grey fishnet tangled with some floating sticks about fifty feet offshore . I stripped to my shorts behind a tree and went in after it . The lake was icy after the summer air . The thing in the nest of sticks did nothing to warm me . It was her hat , with its little veil fluttering in the sun . I disentangled it and held it out of the water in my left hand as I side-stroked back to shore . There I discovered that the hat had more than the veil attached to it . In the damp silk lining there was a smear of coagulated blood about the size of a thumbnail . Adhering to this was a thin lock of hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight , like Harriet 's , and it had been torn out by the roots . I dressed and went up to the lodge on cold and heavy legs and showed the other men what I had found . Arnie whistled softly , on a diminuendo . " Looks like we 're too late . " " That remains to be proved . How good is the law around here ? " " Spotty . It 's been improving , but there 's six or seven differentjurisdictions around the lake . It spreads the money thin , and also the responsibility . "  | " Can you bring the Reno P.D . in on this ? It needs lab work . " " And a dragging operation . It 's not their territory , but I 'll see what I can do . You want to come back to town with me ? " " I should talk to Sholto . Does he live in this neighborhood ? " " A couple of miles from here , on the road to State Line . I 'll drop you . " Sholto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the road . Chickens scratched around it . The young woman who answered the door had a baby on her hip and a slightly larger child hanging onto her skirt . She pushed back her hair and gave Arnie a wide slack smile . " Hank is out back , Mr. Walters . He 's building a hutch for the rabbits . Come through the house if you want . " A third child , a girl of eight or nine , was reading a comic book at the kitchen table , simultaneously drinking chocolate milk through a straw . Her bare toes were curled with concentratedpleasure . She regarded us blankly , as though we were less vivid than the characters in her book . I paid particular attention to the child because her towhead was the same color as Harriet 's . A boy of twelve or so was helping his father in the back yard . That is , he sat on a board laid across wooden horses while Sholto used a handsaw on the board . He was a wiry man of indeterminate age , hipless in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes a fiercely questioning look . " Iii , Mr. Walters . You find her all right ? " " Not yet . This is my associate Lew Archer . He has some more questions to ask you . " Sholto laid down his saw and gave me a wide hard hand . " Shoot away . " " Before you men talk , " Arnie said , " I want to show you a picture , Henry . " He produced the self-sketch of Campion which he hadp129brought from the car . " Is this the man you saw with Harriet ? " " Sure looks like him . Something funny about the eyes , though . How come one of ' em is bigger than the other ? " " He drew it that way , " I said . " He drew this himself ? " " That 's right . " " Why did he do that to the eyes ? It makes him look cockeyed . He 's a real nice-lookin ' fellow in real life . " Arnie lifted the picture from his hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Is the guy some kind of a crook ? " " He has a record , " I said . " Maybe you 'd better send the boy inside . " " I do n't wan na go inside . " " Inside , " Sholto said . The boy climbed off his board and went . Arnie followed him into the house , with a curt flick of the hand to us . Sholto said to me : " I hope Miss Blackwell is n't in trouble . She 's a nervous young lady , jumpy as a filly . She would n't take trouble too well . " " Was she nervous last night when you talked to her ? " He propped one foot up on a sawhorse and rested his arm on his knee . " I 'd say she was . Mostly I think she was nervous on account of her father  --  you know , the young fellow , and them using the lodge . But she had a perfect right  --  I told Mr. Walters that . And I told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After all , she 's used it before when he was n't here . " " With men ? " " I du n no about that . This is the first man she ever brought up here , leastways that I saw . What did the two of them have in mind ? " " They talked about getting married . " " Is that a fact ? " " You sound surprised . "  | " It 's just that I never thought of her as the marrying type . I got a sister teaches school in Porterville , she 's the same way . She 's still living at home . " " Miss Blackwell is n't . How were the two of them getting along when you saw them ? " " I did n't see them together . She came up to the door by herself , wanting the key to the lodge . He stayed in the car . " Sholto pushed back his cap and scratched his freckled hairline , as though to promote the growth of an idea . " They did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The wife thought they were having an argument . " " Did you hear any of it ? " " I did n't like to listen , " he said delicately . " Besides , I had the radio on . " " Did your wife hear any of it ? " " She must of , or how would she know it was an argument ? " IIe raised his voice : " Molly ! " The woman appeared at the back door with the baby on her hip . From the cover of her other hip , the twelve-yearoldpeered out resentfully . " What is it , Hank ? " " Last night , when Miss Blackwell came for the key , and they were sitting out in the car after  --  did you hear anything they said ? " " Yeah . I told you they were having a battle . " I moved to the foot of the back steps . " Did he hit her ? " " Not that I saw . It was just talk . She did n't want to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to go ? " " That 's what she said . She said he was trying to use her or something , said he was taking advantage of her love . He said he was n't . He said that he was working out his des  --  destry ? " " Destiny ? " " Yeah , destiny . He said he was working out his destiny orp131something . I du n no what he meant when he said that . They were talkie ' pretty high-falutin ' . " " How did his voice sound ? Was he excited ? " " Naw , he was real cool and cold . She was more hysterical like . " " Did he threaten her , Mrs. Sholto ? " " I would n't say he threatened her . More like he soothed her down . She was okay when they drove off . " " Who was driving ? " " He was . She was at the wheel when they were sitting there , but he changed places with her . He did the driving . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n no . The clock broke . When are you going to get me a new clock , Hank ? " " Saturday . " " I bet , " she said serenely , and retreated into the house . Sholto turned to me . " It was twilight when they left here , nearly night , I 'd say around eight o'clock . I did n't know there was nothin ' wrong or I 'd of phoned her father . You think the guy did something to her , eh ? " " We have some evidence that points that way . Was MissBlackwell wearing a hat when you saw her last night ? " " Yeah , a little hat with a veil . I noticed it because the girlsdo n't go in for hats around here much . " " I found her hat in the lake just now , " I said . " With blood and hair on it . " His eyes went almost out of sight in their twin nests of wrinkles . " The man she was with , Campion , is implicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her maiden name was Dolly Stone , and she 's supposed to have spent some time here last summer . Did you ever hear of a Dolly Stone , or Dolly Campion ? " " No , sir . No siree. "  | " What about Q. R. Simpson ? " " Come again . " " Quincy Ralph Simpson . His wife told me he was up here a couple of months ago . " " Yeah , " he said matter-of-factly , " I knew Ralph . He worked for the Blackwells for a little while , in May I think it was . The Colonel opened the lodge early this year , in April . He told me he wanted to give his new little wife a chance to watch the spring come on . " He paused , and glanced at the declining sun as though to reorient himself in the present day . " Did something happen to Ralph Simpson ? " " He 's the other murder victim . We do n't know for certain that Campion was responsible . The chances are he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blackwells ? " " Chief cook and bottlewasher , while he lasted . He did n't last long . " " Why not ? " Sholto kicked at one of the sawhorses . " I do n't like to pass it on about a dead man . There was talk around that Ralph took something . I did n't put much stock in it myself . Ralph may have been a gamblin ' fool , but that do n't make him no thief . " " He was a gambler ? " " Yeah , he ca n't stay away from the tables . It was my belief he gambled away his money and got stuck here and had to take any job he could get . He must of had some reason for hiring himself out for a cook  --  a young fellow with his brains . Now you tell me he 's dead , " he said with some resentment . " Did you know him well , Mr. Sholto ? " " We shot the breeze a couple of times when I was doing repair work at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to piece it . Ralph Simpson was a likable fellow , full of ideas . " " What kind of ideas ? " " All kinds . Man in space , the atom bomb , he had an opinion on everything . Reincarnation and the hereafter . He had ap133great understanding . Also , he had a system to beat the tables , for which he was trying to raise the capital . " " How ? " " He did n't say . " " What is he supposed to have stolen from the Blackwells ? " " I du n no . I never got it straight . " " Who did you hear it from ? " " Kito . He 's houseboy in one of the other lodges . But you ca n't always trust these Orientals . " " Still I 'd like to talk to Kito . " " He is n't around any more . The family closed the place up last month and went back to Frisco . " " Do you know their address in Frisco ? " " I have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , will you ? " He went in and came out with a Belvedere address written in childish longhand on the back of an envelope . I transcribed it in my notebook . " Is there anything else you can tell me about Simpson ? " " I ca n't think of anything " " Or anyone else who can ? " " Well , he did have a girl friend . It would n't be fair to pass that on to his wife . Matter of fact , he never mentioned a wife . I thought he was a single man . " " It hardly matters now , " I said , with my ball-point poised over the open notebook . " What 's the girl friend 's name ? " " He called her Fawn . I do n't rightly know her last name . I saw her a couple of times in the clubs with Ralph , and once or twice since . " He added , with a rueful glance at the house : " I do n't go there to gamble . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I like to stand around and watch the excitement . " " Can you describe the girl ? " " She 's a pretty little thing . She looks something like a real fawn  --  she has those big brown eyes . " " What color hair ? "  | " Light blonde , palomino color . " That did n't make it easier . Palomino fillies browsed in herds on the Tahoe shores . " You say she 's little ? " " Yeah , about five foot two or three . " He held out a hand at shoulder level . " I call that little in a woman . " " What does she do for a living ? " " I du n no where she works , or if she works . She may not even be here any more . We have a floating population . They drift in and out . I been here for years myself , come here from Porterville when State Line was nothin ' more than a wide place in the road . " " When did you last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it was at the Solitaire . She had some older fellow on the string and they were playing the machines , leastways she was . He kept buying silver dollars for her . Yeah , I 'm pretty certain it was the Solitaire . " SHOLTO deposited ME in front of the club and bumped away in his pickup . The main street of State Line was an unstable blend of small-time frontier settlement and big-time carnival . The lake seemed artificial seen from here : a man-made lake dyed a special shade of blue and surrounded by papier-mache mountains . In this setting it was hard to believe in death , and life itself was denatured . I went inside the club , where the late afternoon crowd were enjoying themselves , if gamblers can be said to enjoy themselves . They wheedled cards or dice like sinners praying to heaven for one small mercy . They pulled convulsively at the handles of one-armed bandits , as if the machines were computersthat would answer all their questions . Am I getting old ?  |p135Have  I failed ? Am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate me ? Hit me , jackpot , flood me with life and liberty and happiness . A number of men and a few women were hanging around the bar . I waited my turn with one of the overworked bartendersand asked him where the security officer was . " I saw Mr. Todd on the floor a minute ago . " He scanned the big room . " There he is , talking to the character in the hat . " I made my way down one of the aisles of slot machines . Todd was an athletic-looking man in an open-necked shirt . He had iron-grey hair , iron-grey eyes , a face that had been humanized by punishment . The other man , who wore a white Stetson with a rolled brim , was drunk and fat and furious . He had been robbed , the machines were fixed , he 'd see the management , invoke his influence with the governor . With gentle firmness Todd steered him to the front door . I stepped out after Todd , away from the din of the gamblers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed it back . " I used to be with the California Highway Patrol . Looking for somebody ? " " Several people . " I gave him full descriptions of Campion and Harriet . " I do n't believe I 've seen ' em , at least not together . I ca n't be certain . The turnover in this place is something for the book . Sometimes I think it 's the bottleneck where the whole country passes through sooner or later . " His eyes were on the drunk , who was weaving across the street through light traffic . " Try something easier , " I said . " A girl named Fawn something . She 's a small girl with beautiful brown eyes , I 'm told , pale blonde hair . Fawn has been seen in your place . " Todd said with more interest : " What do you want with her ? " " I have some questions to ask her . She knew a man who was murdered in California . " " She involved ? "  | " I have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's a nice kid . " " You know her , do you ? " " Sure . She 's in and out . Her last name 's King , I think , if she has n't remarried . " " Has she been in today ? " " Not yet . She probably sleeps in the daytime . " " Where ? " " I do n't know her that well . She used to work in the beauty parlor down the street . Try there . You 'll see it on the left a couple of blocks from here . " He pointed west toward California . I went that way , past gambling houses that resembled supermarkets with nothing to sell . The first effects of night were coming on . Though everything was clearly visible , the fronts of the buildings were stark in their nakedness , as if the light had lost its supportive quality . Marie 's Salon de Paris was closed . I knocked on the glass door . After a while a large woman emerged from a room at the back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a light before she opened the door . Her hair was the color of a spectacular sunset , and she wore it low on her forehead in curled bangs , a dubious advertisement for her trade . Warm air smelling of chemicals and women drifted out past her . " I 'm looking for a woman named Fawn King . " " You 're not the first . I hope you 'll be the last . Mrs. King does n't work here any more . " " Where can I put my hands on her ? " It was a bad choice of expression . Her pouched eyes went over me coldly , including my hands . I tried again : " I happen to be a detective  --  " " She in trouble ? " Marie said hopefully . " A friend of hers is in the worst kind of trouble . He 's dead . Stabbed with an icepick. "  |p137She  brightened up alarmingly . " Why did n't you say so ? Come in . I 'll get you King 's address . " Fawn lived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same road . I started to walk , but on the way I noticed a Udrivesign at a gas station . I rented a new-looking Ford that sounded elderly . The attendant said it was the altitude . The apartment house had a temporary atmosphere , like a motel . It was U-shaped and two-storied . The U enclosed the tenants ' parking lot , with its open end facing the street . I drove in and left the Ford in one of the white-marked slots . Fawn 's apartment was number twenty-seven on the second floor . I went up the outside steps and along the railed gallery till I found her door . There was music behind it , the sound of a woman singing a blues . It was n't quite good enough to be a record , and there was no accompaniment . The song broke off when I knocked . She appeared at the door , her face still softened by music . Her brown eyes held a puzzled innocence . Perhaps she was puzzled by her body and its uses . It was full and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too quickly . She held it for me to look at and said in a semiprofessional voice : " Hello . I was just practicing my blues style . " " I heard . You have a nice voice . " " So they all tell me . The trouble is , the competition here is terrif . They bring in recording stars , and it is n't fair to the localtalent . " " You 're a local girl ? " " This is my third season . My third fabulous season . Which makes me an old-timer . " " And you want to be a singer ? " " Anything , " she said . " Anything to get out of the rat race . Do you have any suggestions ? " My usual line was ready , the one I used on aspiring starlets and fledgling nightingales and girls who hoped to model their way into heaven : I was from Hollywood , knew movie peo/pie , could help . Her puzzled innocence stopped me . " Just keep trying . " She regarded me suspiciously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody send you ? " " Ralph Simpson . " " What do you know ? I have n't heard from Ralph for it must be at least two months . " She stepped aside in a quick dancer'smovement . " Come in , tell me about him . " It was a hot-plate apartment containing a studio bed that had n't been made , an open portable record player , a dressing table loaded with cosmetic jars and bottles and a few paperbackednovels with young women like Fawn portrayed on their covers . The calendar on the wall had n't been changed since April . I sat on the studio bed . " When did you last hear from Ralph ? " " Couple of months , like I said . He spent the night with me , " she went on routinely , " it must of been sometime around the middle of May . That was when he lost his job and did n't have no place  --  any place to go . I lent him bus fare in the morning , have n't seen him since . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Not in the way you think . It 's a brother-and-sister act betweenRalph and me . We batted around together ever since we were kids in South San Francisco . He was like a big brother to me . Anyway , I would n't take a married man away from his wife . " But she posed in front of me as if she was testing out her power to do this . " I 'm not married , " I said . " I was wondering . " She sat on the bed beside me , so close I could feel her heat . " You do n't talk like a married man and you do n't look like a bachelor . " " I had a wife at one time . She looked something like you . "  | " What was her name ? " " I forget . " There was too much pain in the word , and this was no place to deposit it . " I do n't believe you . What happened to your wife ? " Her brown eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was about to tell her fortune . " Nothing bad happened to her . She left me , but that was n't bad for her . It was bad for me . Eventually she married somebody else and had some kids and lived happily ever after . " She nodded , as if the story 's happy ending might somehow apply to her . " She left you on account of another woman , I bet . " " You 'd lose your bet . I treated her badly , but not in that way . " The pain stirred like a Santa Ana wind in the desert back reaches of my mind . I 'd begun to talk to the girl because she was there . Now I was there , too , more completely than I wanted to be . " Also , " I said , " she did n't like my trade . At the moment I 'm not too crazy about it myself . " " I would n't care what a man did for a living . My ex was just a bookie , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a liv-ing ? " " I 'm a detective . " " How interesting . " But her body tensed , and her eyes glazed with distrust . " Relax , " I said . " If I was the kind of detective you 're afraid of , I would n't be telling you about it , would I ? " " I 'm not afraid . " " Good . You have no reason . I 'm a private detective from Los Angeles . " " Ralph is interested in that kind of work , too . Is that how you know him ? " " In a way . Let 's talk about Ralph . Can you tell me anything about that job he lost ? " " He was a houseboy , more or less . He took jobs like thatp140when he could n't get anything else . He worked for a muckymuckup the lake . He showed me the house one night when the family was out . It was quite a layout . " " I 've seen the Blackwell place . " " Blackwell . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work for the Blackwells ? " " A week or so . I did n't keep tabs on him . " She smiled in her puzzled way . " I have enough trouble keeping tabs on myself . " " Why did they fire him ? " " He did n't tell me he was fired . He said he quit because he had what he wanted . Anyway , the family was going back down south . " " I do n't understand . " " They closed the lodge and went back to L.A. or wherever they live . Ralph thought they were going to stay longer , but they changed their minds . " " I mean I do n't understand about Ralph getting what he wanted . " " Neither do I. You know Ralph , he likes to act mysterious . Ralph Simpson , boy detective . It 's kind of cute . " " Was Ralph doing some sort of detective work at the Blackwellplace ? " " So he said . I do n't always buy a hundred per cent of what Ralph says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gets them mixed up with the things he does himself . " She added , with an indulgent glance at the paperbacks on the dressing table : " I do the same thing with stories sometimes . It makes life more exciting . " I brought her back to the subject : " Tell me what Ralph said . " " I could n't  --  my memory is n't that good . The way he talked , it was all mixed up with the tragedy that happened to Dolly . That hit Ralph hard . He was very fond of Dolly . " " Are you talking about the Dolly who married Bruce Cam-pion ? "  |p141The  force of the question pushed her off the bed away from me . She went to the far side of the room , which was n't very far , and stood beside the dressing table in a defensive posture . " You do n't have to shout at a girl . I have neighbors , remember . The management 's always breathing down my back . " " I 'm sorry , Fawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're working on Dolly 's murder , are n't you ? " " Yes . Was Ralph ? " " I guess he thought he was . But Ralph is no great operator . It 's time somebody with something on the ball did something . Dolly was a sweet kid . She did n't deserve to die . " She looked up at the low ceiling , as if Dolly 's epitaph was also a prayer for herself . Tentatively , almost unconsciously , she drifted back across the room , stood over me with eyes like brimming pools . " It 's a terrible world . " " There are terrible people in it , anyway . Do you know Bruce Campion ? " " I would n't say I know him . Ralph took me out to their place once , when Dolly was living with him . She was crazy about him at that time . She followed him around like a little poodle . " " How did Campion treat her ? " " All right . Actually he did n't pay too much attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he needed a model . He wanted me to model for him , too . I told him I had n't sunk that low yet , to pose for dirty pictures . " " He painted dirty pictures ? " " It sounded like it to me . Dolly said he made her take her clothes off . " Her nostrils flared with righteous indignation . " I only know one good reason a girl should uncover herself in front of a man . " " Why did Campion marry her if all he wanted was a model ? " " Oh , he wanted more . They always do . Anyway , he had to , marry her . He got her pregnant . "  | " Did Dolly tell you this ? " " She did n't have to tell me . I could see it already when Ralph and I were out there . " " Do you remember when that was ? " " It was along toward the end of last summer , late August or early September . They were n't married yet , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ralph brought along a bottle , and we drank a toast to their happiness . It did n't do much good , did it ? She 's dead , and he 's on the run . " She touched my shoulder . " Did he really kill her ? " " All the evidence seems to point to him . " " Ralph said that is n't so . He said there was other evidence , but the cops held back on it . He may have been telling the truth , or having one of his movie spells . You never can tell about Ralph , ' specially where one of his friends is concerned . " She drew a deep breath . " When slid Ralph say these things to you ? " Using her hand on my shoulder as a pivot , she sat down besideme . " The last night he was here . We sat up talking , after I got in . " " Did he tell you what the other evidence was ? " " No . Iie kept his lips buttoned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you anything ? " " No . " " What did he have with him when he left here ? " " Just the clothes that he stood up in . When he came up here he was n't planning to stay , but then he got this job . " She hesitated . " I almost forgot the bundle . He dropped this bundleoff with me a day or two before his job folded . I was n't supposed to open it , he said . I felt it , though . It felt like it had clothes in it . " " What kind of clothes ? " " I would n't know . It was a great big bundle . " She opened her arms . " I tried to ask Ralph about it , but he was n't talking . "  | " Was it stolen goods , do you think ? " She shook her head . " Of course not . Ralph 's no thief . " " What sort of a man is he ? " " I thought you knew him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered after a little thought : " I like Ralph . I do n't want to criticize him . He has a lot of good ideas . The trouble is , he never follows through on them . He keeps changing , because he ca n't make up his mind what he wants to be . I can remember , when we were kids , Ralph was always talking about how he was going to be a big criminal lawyer . But then he never even made it through high school . It 's been like that all his life . " " How long has he known Campion ? " " It goes ' way back , " she said . " Ten years or more . I think they were Army buddies in Korea . They did some talking about Korea the day Ralph took me out to the cabin . " " I 'm interested in that cabin . Do you think you could find it again ? " " Now ? " " Now . " She looked at the leatherette-covered traveling clock on the dressing table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time . " " Stand him up . " " I got rent to pay , mister . Anyway , you wo n't find Bruce Campion there . He only had the cabin for a while last summer . Somebody lent him the use of it . " " I still want to see it . " " Tomorrow . Buy me brunch tomorrow , and I 'll show you where it is . It 's real wild on that side of the lake . Buy some sandwiches and we 'll have a picnic . " " I like night picnics . " " But I have a date . " " How much do you expect to make out of him ? "  |p144She  frowned . " I do n't think of it that way . They give me money to gamble , that 's their business . Nobody says I have to throw it all away . " " I 'm asking you how much a couple of hours of your time is worth . " She blinked her innocent eyes . " Twenty ? " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rented Ford , along a road which branched north off the highway through thickening timber . Above the broken dark lines of the trees there were almost as many stars as I had seen in Mexico . The night was turning colder , and the girl moved over against me . " Turn on the heater , will you , mister ? I do n't even knowyour name . " " Lew Archer . " I switched on the blower . " That 's a nice name . Is it your real one ? " " Naturally not . My real name is Natty Bumpo . " " You 're kidding me . " " It 's a free country . " " Is there any such person as Natty What'shisname ? " " Bumpo . He 's a character in a book . He was a great riflemanand a great tracker . " " Are you ? " " I can shoot a rifle but as for tracking , I do my best work in cities . " " Tracking men ? " " Tracking men . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Several , but not with me . I wish I had . " " Do you think that Campion is hiding out in the cabin ? " " He may he , and he may be dangerous . " She giggled nervously . " You 're trying to scare me . I thought he was kind of a sissy , with that little beret he wears , and all his arty talk . " " He 's no sissy . He 's something more complicated than that . "  | " How do you mean ? " " It 's time I told you , Fawn . Dolly is n't the only one who was killed . Ralph Simpson was icepicked last May , soon after you saw him last . Campion is the prime suspect . " She had drawn in her breath sharply , and now she was holding it . I could feel her body tighten against my flank . Her breath came out in gusts around her words . " You must be mistaken . Maybe Bruce Campion did kill Dolly  --  you never can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he would never do anything like that to Ralph . Ralph idolized him , he thought he was the greatest . " " How did Campion feel about Ralph ? " " He liked him . They got along fine . Ralph was proud to have a real artist for a friend . It was one of the things he wanted to be himself . " " I 've known a few artists . They can make difficult friends . " " But they do n't stick icepicks in people . " For the first time , the full meaning of what I had said struck the girl . I could feel it pass through her body , a shuddering aftershock . " Is Ralph really dead ? " " I saw him in the morgue . I 'm sorry , Fawn . " " Poor Ralph . Now he 'll never make it . " We rode in silence for a time . She began to cry , almost inaudibly . At one point she said to the moving darkness : " All my friends are dying off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starred glimpses of the lake between the trees , like polished steel catching the droppings of infinity . I said when her grief had subsided : " Tell me more about Dolly . " " What 's to tell ? " Her voice was hoarse . " She came up here last spring to get a job . She made change at one of the clubs for a while , but her subtraction was n't too hot , so she got herself a man . It 's the same old story . " " This time the ending was different . Did you know her well ? "  | " There was n't much to know . She was just a country girl from the sticks . I sort of befriended her when she lost her job . Then Ralph introduced her to Campion , and that was that . " " You said Ralph had a crush on her . " " I would n't put it that strong . Dolly was a beautiful kid , but he never made a play for her . He just wanted to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't belong up here . " " Where did she belong ? " " Let 's see , she told me once where she came from . It was some place down in the orange belt . She used to talk about the orange blossoms . " " Citrus Junction ? " " Yeah . How did you know ? " " Ralph was murdered in Citrus Junction . " THE CABIN STOOD on a wooded point which projected into the lake below the road . I left the car at the top of the lane and told Fawn to stay in it , out of sight . She crouched down in the front seat , peering like a frightened bush-bunny over the edge of the door . I made my way down the rutted dirt lane , walking quietly , like Natty Bumpo . Starshine filtering down between the black conifers hung in the air like the ghost of light . A ramp of solider light slanted from the window of the cabin . I approached it from the side and looked in . A man who was n't Campion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which a low fire burned . He was talking to somebody or something . " Eat it up , Angelo . Enjoy yourself . We 've got to keep your weight up , old boy . " Unless there was someone in the shadowed bunks againstp147the far wall , he seemed to be alone in the room . He was a small man with a dark head and a thin neck like a boy 's . He wore a plaid shirt under a sleeveless red vest . I saw when he moved that he was holding a young hawk , perched on the knuckles of his gauntleted left hand . The brown bird was tearing with its beak at something red held between the man 's thumb and forefinger . " Gorge yourself , " he said indulgently . " Daddy wants you to be a big , healthy boy . " I waited until the bird had finished his red meal . Then I knocked on the door . The small man unlatched it and looked out curiously through rimless spectacles . The hawk 's flecked golden eyes were impassive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry to trouble you , " I said to both of them . " I was told a man named Bruce Campion lived here at one time . " His eyes hardened perceptibly behind the glasses . He said in a careful , cultivated voice : " That 's true enough . Last summerbefore I went to Europe I lent Campion the use of my place . He spent August and part of September here , he told me . Then he got married and moved out . " " Do you know what happened to him after that ? " " No . I 've been on my sabbatical , and rather completely out of touch with my friends in this country . I spent the entire year in Europe and the Near East . " " Campion is a friend of yours ? " " I admire his talent . " He was weighing out his words . " I try to be useful to talent when I can . " " Have you seen Campion recently ? " The question seemed to disturb him . He looked sideways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the bird might providean answer or an augury . The bird sat unblinking , its great eyes bright and calm . " I do n't wish to be rude , " the bird man said . " But I 'd certainlyfeel more comfortable if I knew you had authority to ask me questions . "  | " I 'm a private detective co-operating with several lawenforcementagencies . " I gave him my name . " Co-operating in what ? " " The investigation of a pair of murders , possibly three mur-ders . " He swallowed and grew pale , as though he had swallowed the blood out of his face . " In that case , come in . Do n't mind Michelangelo . He 's completely indifferent to people . " But the hawk jumped straight up when I entered the room . Held by the leather jesses on its legs , it hung in the air for a moment beating its wings and fanning wind into my face . Then its master thrust his fist up , and the bird returned to its perch . We sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm Dr. Damis , " he said . " Edmund B. Damis . I teach at Berkeley , in the art department . " He seemed to be marshaling his professional defenses . " Is that how you happen to know Campion ? " " I met him some years ago , in Chicago . I was a docent at the Art Institute while he was studying there . I admired his painting , as I said , and I 've kept in touch with him . Or rather he has kept in touch with me . " It was a cold account . He was preserving his distance from Campion . " Iie 's a good painter , I 've heard . Is he a good man ? " " I would n't care to pass judgment on him . He lives as he can . I took the easy way , myself . " " I 'm afraid I do n't understand . " " I teach for a living and do my painting , such as it is , on Sundays and on sabbaticals . Campion lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said with some feeling . " You sound almost as though you envied him . " " I almost do . " " It may be a two-way envy , Dr. Damis . Is your middle name Burke , by any chance ? "  | " It is . My father was an admirer of Edmund Burke . " " Did you know that Campion 's been using part of your name as an alias ? He 's been calling himself Burke Damis . " He flushed with displeasure . " Blast him , I wish he 'd leave me and my things alone . " " Has he been at your things ? " " I mean this place . He left it like a pigsty when he moved out last fall . I had to spend most of the last week cleaning it up . Frankly , I 've had enough of Bruce and his messy life and his outre relationships . " " Are you thinking of his relationships with women ? " " I was , yes . We wo n't go into them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Augean stables . " " I wish you would go into them . " " I prefer not to . They 're excessively boring to me . They invariablyfollow the same sado-masochistic pattern . Bruce has always regarded women as his legitimate prey . " " Prey is quite a dramatic word . It reminds me of your hawk . " He nodded , as though I 'd paid them both a subtle compliment . The hawk sat still as a figurine on his hand . It occurredto me that this Damis might be attached to Campion and the hawk in similar ways , watching through rimless spectaclesas the two predators vaulted into space and took their pleasure . " It brings up the fact , " I went on , " that Campion 's wife was strangled two months ago . Campion is wanted for the murder . Did you know that , Dr. Damis ? " " I most assuredly did not . I just flew in from Italy last week , and I came directly here . " He was pale as bone now , and almostchattering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everything . " " But you 've been in touch with Campion . " " How do you know that ? " " Call it intuition . You 'd talk about him differently if youp150had n't seen him for a year . Now when and where did you see him ? " " This morning , " he said with his eyes on the floor . " Bruce came here this morning . He 'd walked halfway around the lake during the night , and he looked perfectly ghastly . " " What did he come to you for ? " " Refuge , I suppose . He admitted that he was in trouble , but he did n't say what kind , and I swear he said nothing about his wife . He wanted to stay here with me . I did n't see that it was possible , or that I owed it to him . He 's always been the taker and I 've been the giver , as it is . Besides , I 've reached a crucial stage in training my hawk . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he leave here ? " " Around noon . I gave him lunch . Naturally I had no idea that I was harboring a fugitive from justice . " " flow did he leave ? " " Ile took my car , " Damis said miserably . " By force ? " " I would n't say that . He is bigger than I am , and more  --  forceful . " He had dropped his pride , and he looked very young without it . " Bruce has an ascendancy over me . I suppose you 're quite right , I 've secretly envied his life , his success with women  --  " " You can stop doing that now . Will you please describe your car  --  make and model ? " " It 's a 1959 Chevrolet convertible , red , with a checkered red and black top . California license number TKU 87964 . " As I was making a note of the number , he added : " Bruce promisedI 'd have it back within twenty-four hours . He knows I 'm stuck out here without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less . I 'll see what I can do about getting it back for you . Do you want me to report it as a theft ? "  | " It was n't a theft . I was a fool to do it , but I lent it to him voluntarily . " " Did he explain why he wanted the car , or where he was going with it ? " " No . " He hesitated . " On second thought , he did give some indication of where he intended to go . He originally proposed that when he was finished with the convertible , he should leave it in Berkeley , in my garage . It certainly suggests that he was beaded in that direction . " " And he was alone when he came here and when he left ? " " Oh yes , definitely . " " Did Campion say anything about the girl he 'd been with ? " " He did n't mention a girl . As a matter of fact , he did very little talking . Who is she ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blonde girl named Harriet Blackwell . " " I never heard of her , I 'm afraid . Has something happened to her ? " " The indications are that she 's in the lake " He was shocked , and his feeling communicated itself to the bird on his fist . The hawk spread its wings . Damis calmed it with his hand before he spoke . " You ca n't mean that Bruce drowned her ? " " Something like that . When he came here this morning , were there any signs that he 'd been in a struggle ? Scratch marks on his face , for instance ? " " Yes , his face was scratched . His clothes were in bad shape , too . " " Were they wet ? " " They looked as though they had been wet . He looked generally as though he 'd had a rough night . " " He 's in for rougher ones , " I said . " Just in case he does come back this way , we 'll want to station a man here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd welcome it . I 'm no more of a physical coward than thep152next person , but  --  " His apprehensive look completed the sentence . " It 's unlikely that he will come back , " I told him reassuringly . " Assuming he does n't , I 'd like to have your ideas on where to look for him . Also , I want your Berkeley address , in case he follows through on his original plan . " " Could n't we skip the Berkeley address ? My mother lives there with me , and I do n't wish her to be alarmed unnecessarily . I 'm sure that she 's in no danger from him . " " Does she know Campion ? " " Very slightly . Minimally . We had him to dinner , once , a couple of years ago . Mother did n't like him at all  --  she said he had a dark aura . At that time , though Mother did n't know it , he was living with some black-stockinged tramp in Sausalito . He 'd previously lived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and probably a number of other places . I would n't know where to start looking for him . Unless , " he added after some thought , " he 's gone to his sister . " " Campion has a sister ? " " He has , but it 's far from likely that he 's with her . She 's a very stuffy Peninsula type , he told me . They do n't get along . " " Where does she live on the Peninsula , and what 's her name ? " " I 'd have to look it up . I 've never met the woman . I only happen to have her address because Campion used it as a mailing address when he was moving around . " Carrying the hawk with him , Damis went to a table in the corner of the room . He opened a drawer and got out a shabby brown leather address book . I stood beside him as he flipped the pages to the C 's . Bruce Campion was the first name on the page . Scribbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damis had mentioned . They were all scratched out except for a Menlo Park address  --  c/o Mrs. Thor Jurgensen , 401 SchoolhouseRoad  --  which I made a note of.  | " I used to think we were good friends , " Damis was saying . His eyes were fixed on the hawk , as though it was feeding him his lines by mental telepathy . " But over the years I caught on to the pattern of our relationship . I heard from Bruce only when he wanted something  --  a loan or a recommendationor the use of something I owned . I 'm heartily sick of the man . I hope I never see him again . " I made no comment . He said to the hawk : " Are you hungry , Angelo ? How about another sparrow wing ? " I left him communing with the silent bird and drove Fawn into State Line . We had filets mignons , carelessly served in one of the gambling clubs . The fat drunk in the white Stetson was balanced precariously on a stool at the bar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His imperfectly focused eyes were watching the girls in the place , especially Fawn . She had some wine with her meat , and it set her talking about Ralph again . He used to take her fishing at Luna Bay when she was in her early teens and he was in his late ones . Once he rescued her from the San Gregorio surf . Her memorieshad a dreamlike quality , and I began to wonder if she had dreamed them in the first place . But she ended by saying : " I ca n't take your twenty dollars . It 's the least I can do for Ralph . " " You might as well take it  --  " " No . There has to be something I wo n't do for money . I mean it . " " You 're a good girl . " " He said as she lifted his wallet . The hustler with the heart of gold  --  cold and yellow . " " You 're being hard on yourself , Fawn . " " And do n't keep calling me Fawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you want me to call you ? " " Do n't call me anything . " " Tell me your real name . " " I hate my real name . " Her face was as blank as a wall.  | " What is it , though ? " " Mabel , " she said with disgust . " My parents had to give me the most unglamorous name in the world . " " Where are your parents , by the way ? " " I put them out for adoption . " " Before or after you changed your name to Fawn ? " " If you have to know , " she said , " I changed my name the night King went AWOL on me and left me in this hole . The funny thing is , I 'm getting sick of calling myself Fawn . I used to think it was glamorous , but now it just sounds like nothing . I 'm getting ready to change my name again . Do you have any suggestions ? " " Not on the spur of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nudging the edge of the table with her papillae . " Let 's go to my place and have another drink and talk about it . " " Thanks , but I have work to do " " It can wait , ca n't it ? I stood up my date for you . " " Also , you 're too young for me . " " I do n't get it , " she said with her puzzled frown . " You 're not old . " " I 'm getting older fast . " I rose and laid some money on the table . " Do you want me to drop you anywhere ? " " I 'll stay here . It 's as good a place as any . " Before I reached the door , the drunk was moving in on her with his white Stetson in his hand and his bald head glowing . I FOUND A telephone booth and called Arnie Walters 's office in Reno . He answered the telephone himself . " Walters here . "  | " This is Lew Archer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving a red Chevvie convertible  --  " " We know that . " Arnie 's voice was low and fast . " Campion 's been seen in Saline City , talking to the key boy of one of the local motels . A patrol cop made him but he did n't pick him up right away . He wanted to check with our bulletin , and he had an idea that Campion was checking in . But when he got back to the motel , Campion had cleared out . This happened within the last couple of hours . Do you have later information ? " " You 're ' way ahead of me . Did you get the name of the motel ? " " The Travelers , in Saline City . It 's a town in the East Bay . " " What about Harriet ? " " Nothing so far . We 're starting dragging operations in the morning . The police lab established that the blood in the hat is her type , B , but that does n't mean much . " " How do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , " Arnie said . " He wanted to come up here , but I think I talked him out of it . If this case does n't break pretty soon , he 's going to blow a gasket . " " So am I. " By midnight I was in Saline City looking for the TravelersMotel . It was on the west side of town at the edge of the salt flats . Red neon outlined its stucco facade and failed to mask its shabbiness . There was nobody in the cluttered little front office . I rangthe handbell on the registration desk . A kind of grey-hairedyouth came out of a back room with his shirttails flapping . " Single ? " " I do n't need a room . You may be able to give me some in-formation . " " Is it about the murderer ? " " Yes . I understand you talked to him . What was the subject of conversation ? " He groaned , and stopped buttoning up his shirt . " I alreadyp156told all this to the cops . You expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabbage ? " I gave him a five-dollar bill . He peered at it myopically and put it away . " Okay , if it 's all that important . What you want to know ? " " Just what Campion said to you . " " Is that his name  --  Campion ? He said his name was Damis . He said he spent the night here a couple months ago , and he wanted me to look up the records to prove it . " " Was he actually here a couple of months ago ? " " Uh-huh . I remembered his face . I got a very good memory for faces . " IIe tapped his low forehead lovingly . " ' Course I could n't say for sure what date it was until I looked up the old registration cards . " " You did that , did you ? " " Yeah , but it did n't do him no good . He took off while I was out back checking . The patrol car stopped by , the way it alwaysdoes around eight o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'd like to see that registration card . " " The cops took it with them . They said it was evidence . " " What was the date on it ? " " May five , I remember that much . " It was evidence . May the fifth was the night of Dolly Campion'sdeath . " You 're sure the man who registered then was the same man you talked to tonight ? " " That 's what the cops wanted to know . I could n't be absotivelycertain , my eyes are n't that good . But he looked the same to me , and he talked the same . Maybe he was lying about it , though . He said his name was Damis , and it turns out that 's a lie . " " He registered under the name Damis on the night of May the fifth , is that correct ? " " They both did . "  | " Both ? " " I did n't get to see the lady . She came in her own car after he registered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that , so I thought nothing of it . She took off in the morning , early , I guess . " " How do you remember all that , when you 're not even certainit was the same man ? " " He sort of reminded me . But I remembered all right when he reminded me " He was a stupid man . His eyes were glazed and solemn with stupidity . I said : " Do you have any independent recollectionsof the night of May the fifth ? " " The date was on the registration card . " " But he could have registered another night , and said that it was May the fifth ? And the man who signed in on May fifth could have been another man ? " I realized that I was talking like a prosecutor trying to confusea witness . My witness was thoroughly confused . " I guess so , " he said dejectedly . " Did Campion tell you why he was so interested in pinning down the date ? " " He did n't say . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you money ? " " He did n't have to . I said I 'd help him out . After all , he was a customer . " " But you 'd only seen him once before ? " " That 's right . On the night of May five . " His voice was stubborn . " What time did he check in that night ? " " I could n't say . It was n't too late . " " And he stayed all night ? " " I could n't say . We do n't keep watch on the guests . " He yawned , so wide I could count his cavities . " What 's your name ? " I said . " Nelson Karp. "  | " My name is Archer , Nelson . Lew Archer . I 'm a private detective , and I have to ask you to return the five dollars I gave you . I 'm sorry . You 're probably going to be a witness in a murder trial , and you 'll want to be able to tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bill out of his pocket and dropped it on the counter . " I might of known there was a catch to it . " " I said I was sorry . " " You and who else is sorry ? " " Anyway , the State pays witnesses . " I did n't say how little , and Nelson Karp cheered up . " When Campion left here tonight , which way did he go ? " " ' Crost San Mateo Bridge . I heard them say that . " " By them ' you mean the cops ? " " Yeah . They did a lot of telephoning from here . " He gesturedtoward the pay phone on the wall . I stepped outside and looked across the flats , where piles of salt rose like ephemeral pyramids . The lights of the Peninsulawinked blearily in the haze across the Bay . As the crow flies , or the hawk , I was n't more than ten miles from Menlo Park . I went back into the office and got some change from Karp and placed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister Mrs. Jurgensen . Her phone rang thirteen times , and then a man 's voice answered . " Hello . " " I have a person call for Mrs. Thor Jurgensen , " the operator intoned . " Mrs. Jurgensen is n't here . Can I take a message ? " " Do you wish to leave a message , sir ? " the operator said to me . I did n't . Campion knew my voice , as I knew his . Shortly after one o'clock I parked in the three-hundred block of Schoolhouse Road in Menlo Park . I crossed into the nextp159block on foot , examining the mailboxes for the Jurgensens ' number . It was a broad and quiet street of large ranchtypehouses shadowed by oaks that far predated them . Bayshorewas a murmur in the distance . At this hour most of the houses were dark , but there was light in a back window of 401 . I circled the house . My footstepswere muffled in the dew-wet grass . Crouching behind a plumbago bush , I peered through a matchstick bamboo blind into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divided by a breakfast bar into cooking and living areas . A used-brick fireplace took up most of one wall . Campion was sleeping peacefully on a couch in front of the fireplace . A road map unfolded on his chest rose and fell with his breathing . He had on the remains of his grey suit . There were dark stains on it , oil or mud or blood . His face was scratched , and charred with beard . His right arm dragged on the floor and he had a gun there at his fingertips , a medium-caliber nickelplatedrevolver . No doubt I should have called the police . But I wanted to take him myself . A detached garage big enough for three cars stood at the rear of the property . I approached it through a flower garden and let myself in through the unlocked side door . One of the two cars inside had the outlines of a Chevrolet convertible . It was Dr. Damis 's car . I read his name on the steering post in the light of my pencil flash . The keys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocketed them . I looked around for a weapon . There was a work bench at the rear of the garage , and attached to the wall above it was a pegboard hung with tools . I had a choice of several hammers . I took down a light ball-peen hammer and hefted it . It would do . I went back to the Chevrolet and stuck a matchbook be/tween the horn and the steering wheel . It began to blow like Gabriel 's horn . I moved to the open side door and flattened myself against the wall beside it , watching the back of the house . My ears were hurting . The enclosed space was filled with yelling decibels which threatened to crowd me out . Campion came out of the house . He ran through the garden , floundering among camellias . The nickel-plated revolver gleamed in his hand . Before he reached the garage he stopped and looked all around him , as though he suspected a trick . But the pull of the horn was too strong for him . He had to silenceit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter the doorway . I struck him on the back of the head with the hammer , not too hard and not too easily . He fell on his gun . I got it out from under him and dropped it in my jacket pocket . Then I unjammed the horn . A man was swearing loudly in the next yard . I stepped outside and said : " Good evening . " He turned a flashlight on me . " What goes on ? You 're not Thor Jurgensen . " " No . Where are the Jurgensens ? " " They 're spending the night in the City . I was wondering who was using their house . " He came up to the fence , a heavy-bodied man in silk pajamas , and looked me over closely . I smiled into the glare . I was feeling pretty good . " A wanted man was using it . I 'm a detective , and I just knocked him out . " " Evelyn 's brother ? " " I guess so " " Does Evelyn know he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poor Evelyn . " His voice held that special blend of grief and glee which we reserve for other people 's disasters . " Poor old Thor . I suppose this will be in the papers  --  "  |p161I  cut him short : " Call the Sheriff 's office in Redwood City , will you ? Tell them to send a car out . " He moved away , walking springily in his bare feet . ROYAL AND I waited outside the hospital room while Campion returned to consciousness . It took him the better part of an hour . I had time to fill the Captain in on my activities , and Campion 's . Royal was unimpressed by my findings in Saline City . " He 's trying to fake an alibi for his wife 's murder . " " Or establish one . I think you should talk to the key boy Nelson Karp , and see if that registration card is genuine . It 's in the hands of the Saline City police . " Royal said without much interest : " Alibis like that one come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have checked in at this motel and even spent part of the night , then driven back to Luna Bay and done her in . It 's only about thirty miles between the two places . " " Which makes it all the easier to check . " " Look , " he said , " I 've got other things on my mind . Take it up with Deputy Mungan if you like . He 's in charge of the substationat Luna Bay , and he 's been handling the evidential de-tails . " I did n't pursue the argument . Royal was a good cop but like , other good cops he had an inflexible mind , once it was made up . We sat in uneasy silence for a few minutes . Then a young ; resident wearing a white coat and a high-minded expression came out of Campion 's room and announced that , in view of the importance of the case , his patient could be questioned . Royal and I went in past the uniformed guard . It was an ordinarysmall hospital room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campion 's bed was slightly raised at the head . He lay still and watched us . His heavy eyes recognizedeach of us in turn , but he did n't speak . His head was bandaged , and the flesh around his eyes was turning purple . Scratches stood out on his pale cheeks . I said : " Hello , Campion . " Royal said : " Long time no see , Bruce . " Campion said nothing . The turbanlike bandage on his head , the grimace of pain on his mouth , made him look a little like an Indian fakir lying on a bed of spikes . Royal 's shadow fell across him . " What did you do with HarrietBlackwell , Bruce ? " " I did n't do anything with her . " " She was last seen in your company . " " I ca n't help it . " " You ca n't help killing people , you mean ? " " I 've never killed anyone . " " What about your little wife Dolly ? " " I did n't kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We know different . You 've had your little burst of freedom . This is the end of the trail . The end of the trail and the beginning of the trial . " Royal grinned at his own bad joke . " Anything you say can be used against you , true , but I 'm advising you to speak out now , tell us the whole thing freely . It 'll be easier on you in the long run . " " Sure , " Campion said . " They 'll put a cushion on the chair in the gas chamber and perfume the cyanide . " Royal leaned over the bed , his wide shoulders blotting out Campion 's face . " You know you 're headed for the gas chamber , eh ? So why not give me the full story , Bruce ? I been waiting a long time to hear it . Just come clean about Dolly , and I 'm your friend . I 'll do what I can to save you from the green room . " " Do n't do me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You have bad breath . " Royal 's open hand jerked up . " Why , you dirty little bas  --  "  |p163He  bit the word in two and backed away , with a sideways glance at me . Campion said : " Go ahead and hit me . Hitting people is what you people are for . I 've hated you people all my life . You sell out justice to the highest bidder and let the poor people take the gaff . " " Shut up , you . " Royal was shouting . " You lie there crying about justice with women 's blood on your hands . " Campion flapped his hands in front of his face . " I do n't see any blood . " " That 's right , you did n't shed any blood when you killed Dolly . You used a stocking around her neck . Her own stocking . " Royal made a spitting noise . " What goes on in a mind like yours , Bruce ? I 'd like to know . " " You never will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too ignorant to know a psycho when I see one , foolingaround with paintboxes and living on women . Why do n't you do a man 's work ? " " Like vagging prostitutes and shaking them down ? " " Do n't talk to me about prostitutes . I read a book about that whoring psycho French painter  --  the one that cut off his ear and committed suicide . How psycho can you get ? " Campion sat up in bed . " If you were n't so ignorant you 'd speak of Van Gogh with respect . Incidentally , he was n't a Frenchman . He was a Dutchman , and a great religious gen-ius . " " And you 're another ? Is that what you 're trying to say ? You 're a great religious genius who goes in for human sacri-fice ? " " You 're the one who puts people in the gas chamber . " " I 'm the one , and that 's where you 're going . " I stepped between them , facing Royal . His face was congestedwith blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd never seen him out of control before . Campion had lain back and closed his eyes.  |p164I  opened them with a question : " How did the blood get on Harriet 's hat ? " " What hat ? " " The hat I fished out of the lake today . What was it doing in the lake , and how did her blood and hair get on the lining ? " " You better ask her . It 's her hat . " " You knew it was in the lake ? " " You just told me , and I know you would n't lie . Cops never lie . " " Change the record , boy . How did that hat get into the lake ? " " I said , why do n't you ask her ? " " She is n't available . Where is she , Campion ? " " I would n't know . I have a suggestion , however . " " What is it ? " " Disappear . I 'm a sick man . I need rest . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I 'm incommunicado . It 's my reputation that 's ques-tionable . " " Stop playing word games . " " Why ? A man needs some amusement in the long night watches . Storm troopers make dull companions . " Hot blood rose in my face . I felt a growing solidarity with Royal . " You do n't show much concern for your fiancee . " " My what ? " " You were going to marry her , were n't you ? " " Was I ? " " Answer me . " " You already know all the answers . Cops always do . " " If you were n't going to marry her , why did you take her to Tahoe ? Because the lake is deep ? " Campion looked up at me with a deathly boredom . Royal spoke behind me in a new quiet voice : " Mr. Archer deservesp165an answer , Bruce . He 's gone to a lot of trouble to ask you that question . " " Mr. Archer can take a running jump in the lake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " with a little help from you ? " " I do n't know what she did . I never touched her . " " How did you get those marks on your face ? " One of his hands crawled up to his face . His fingers exploredit like a blind man 's fingers palpating a strange object . " I was wandering around in the woods last night . I must have scratched myself on the bushes . " " This was after your trouble with Harriet ? " He nodded almost imperceptibly . " What was the trouble about ? " He lay and looked at me . " What trouble ? " " You mentioned trouble with Harriet . " " You were the one who mentioned trouble , " he said . " But you agreed that trouble had occurred . " " You must have been hearing things . " " I saw you nod your head . " " I have a slight tremor . Please excuse it . It comes from being beaten half to death by storm troopers . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not going away , " Royal said at my shoulder . " You admitted you had trouble with the girl . You 've taken the first step toward the truth . You might as well give us the rest of it and get it over with . How about it , Bruce ? " " Do n't call me Bruce . " " Bruce is your name , is n't it ? " " Not to you . To my friends . " " What friends ? " Royal said in bitter contempt . " I have friends . " " Where are they ? Under the ground ? " Campion turned his face away . " Did Ralph Simpson call you Bruce ? " I said.  | " What ? " he said to the wall . " Did Ralph Simpson call you Bruce ? " " Yes , he did . " " You were friends ? " " Yes . " " Then why did you knock him off and steal his papers ? " His eyes rolled in my direction . " I did n't steal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your pocket , " Royal said . " Ralph lent it to me . " " The same night you stuck the icepick in him ? " Campion 's mouth became rectangular . I could see the red tongue curled behind his teeth . He raised his voice and cried out . His eyes turned up , and their veined whites glared at us as he went on yelling inarticulately . Royal and I exchanged shameful looks . For some reason we were feeling guilty , at least I was . When Campion stopped his noise and fell back onto the pillow , other noises could be heard in the corridor . A woman seemed to be arguing with more than one man . Royal started for the door . It was flung open before he reached it . The woman who burst in resembled Campion , though she was older and softer and better cared for . " What are you doing to my brother ? " " Nothing , ma'am , " Royal said . " That is , we had some ques-tions  --  " " Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the other way around . " She moved past him to the bed . " They 've hurt you , Bruce . " Campion looked at her bleakly . " If I can stand it , you can . Go away . " " He 's right , Mrs. Jurgensen , " Royal said . " You should n't be in here , you know . " The guard spoke up from the doorway . " That 's what I was trying to tell her , Captain . I did n't know if I should use physical force . "  |p167Royal  shook his head curtly . A tall man came in past the guard . He had greying blond crewcut hair and a long face . His mouth was pinched as though he 'd been sucking a lemon . He took the woman by the arm and tried to drag her away from the bed . She resisted his efforts without looking at him . She was staringhungrily at her brother 's face . " Do n't you want me to help you ? " " You were among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do with it now . Get lost . " " You heard him , Evelyn , " the tall man said . He had a faint Scandinavian accent , more a lack of timbre than an accent . " He wants no part of us . We want no part of him . " " But he 's my brother . " " I know that , Evelyn . Do you want everyone in the Bay area to know it ? Do you want young Thor to lose his fraternity connection ? Do you want people pointing me out on MontgomeryStreet ? " " You hear your husband , " Campion said . " Why do n't you amscray , sister ? Fold your tensions like the Arabs and silently steal away . " The resident doctor appeared with a nurse in tow . He cast a withering glance around the room . " May I remind you this is a hospital , Captain . This man is your prisoner but also my patient . I gave you permission to question him on the understanding that it would be quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not responsible  --  " " I am . I want this room cleared immediately . That includes you , Captain . " " I 'm not finished with my interrogation . " " It can wait till morning . " Royal dropped the issue . He had the trial to think of , and the use that Campion 's defense could make of the doctor 's testimony . He walked out . The rest of us went along.  |p168Not  entirely by accident , I met the Jurgensen couple in the parking lot . They pretended not to see me , but I planted myselfbetween them and their Mercedes sedan and made a fast pitch to her . " I 'm a private detective working on this case and it 's come to my attention that there are some holes in the case against your brother . I 'd like very much to talk to you about it . " " Do n't say a word , Evelyn , " her husband said . " If we could sit down and have an exchange of views , Mrs. Jurgensen  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply trying to pump you . " " Why do n't you stay out of this ? " I said . " He is n't your brother . " She turned to him . " I 'm worried about him , Thor , and I 'm ashamed . All these months we 've pretended he did n't exist , that we had no connection  --  " " We have no connection . We decided that between us and that 's the way it 's going to be . " " Why do n't you let the lady do her own talking ? " I said . " There is n't going to be any talking . You get out of the way . " Ile took me by the shoulder and pushed me to one side . There was no point in hitting him . The Mercedes whisked them away to their half-acre earthly paradise . I checked in at a Camino Real motel and went to sleep trying to think of some one thing I could do that would be absolutelyright and final . I dreamed that Campion was innocent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper dolls that stuck to my fingers . Then I found Harriet 's body in the lake . She had talon marks on her head . I awoke in a cold sweat . The late night traffic whirred with a sound like wings along the highway.  |p169I  GOT UP into the sharp-edged uncertaintiesof morning and drove across the county to Luna Bay . Patrick Mungan , the deputy in charge there , was a man I knew and trusted . I hoped the trust was reciprocal . When I entered the bare stucco substation , his broad face generated a smile which resembled sunlight on a cliff . " I hear you 've been doing our work for us , Lew . " " Somebody has to . " " Uh-huh . You look kind of bedraggled . I keep an electric razor here , in case you want to borrow it . " I rubbed my chin . It rasped . " Thanks , it can wait . Captain Royal tells me you handled the evidence in the Dolly Campion murder . " " What evidence there was . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there to be picked up . " Mungan had risen from his desk . He was a huge man who towered over me . It gave me the not unpleasant illusion of being small and fast , like a trained-down welterweight . He opened the swinging door at the end of the counter that dividedthe front office . " Come on in and sit down . I 'll send out for coffee . " " That can wait , too . " " Sure , but we might as well be comfortable while we talk . " He summoned a young deputy from the back room and dispatchedhim for coffee . " What got you so involved in the Campion business ? " " Some Los Angeles people named Blackwell hired me to look into Campion 's background . He 'd picked up their daughter Harriet in Mexico and was romancing her , under an alias . Three days ago they ran away together to Nevada , where shep170disappeared . The indications are that she 's his second victim , or his third . " I told Mungan about the hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quincy Ralph Simpson . He listened earnestly , with the corners of his mouth drawn down like a bulldog 's , and said when I 'd done : " The Blackwell girl I do n't know about . But I do n't see any reason why Campion would stab Ralph Simpson . It may be true what he said about Simpson lending him his papers to use . They were friends . When the Campionsmoved here last fall , it was Simpson who found them a house . Call it a house , but I guess it was all they could afford . They had a tough winter . " " In what way ? " " Every way . They ran out of money . The wife was pregnant and he was n't working , unless you call painting pictures work . They had to draw welfare money for a while . The county cut ' em off when they found out Campion was using some of it to buy paints . Ralph Simpson helped them out as much as he could . I heard when the baby was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That 's interesting . " " Yeah . It crossed my mind at the time that maybe Simpson was the baby 's father . I asked him if he was , after Dolly got killed . he denied it . " " It 's still a possibility . Simpson was a friend of Dolly 's before she knew Campion . I found out last night that Simpson was responsible for bringing them together in the first place . If Simpson got her pregnant and let Campion hold the bag , it would give Campion a motive for both killings . I realize that 's very iffy reasoning . " " It is that . " " Have you had any clear indication that Campion was n't the father ? " Mungan shook his ponderous head . " All the indications point the other way . Remember she was well along when hep171married her in September . A man does n't do that for a woman unless he 's the one . " " I admit it is n't usual . But Campion is n't a usual man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody was like him , the whole country would be headed for Hades in a handbasket . A hand-painted handbasket . " He laid his palm on the desk as if he was covering a hole card . " Personally I have my doubts that those two killings , Dolly and Simpson , are connected . I 'm not saying they are n't connected . I 'm only saying I have my doubts . " " They have to be connected , Pat . Simpson was killed within a couple of weeks of Dolly  --  a couple of weeks which he apparentlyspent investigating her death . Add to that the fact that he was found buried in her home town . " " Citrus Junction ? " I nodded . " Maybe he went to see the baby , " Mungan said thoughtfully . " The baby 's in Citrus Junction , you know . Dolly 's mother came and got him . " " You seem to like my idea after all . " " It 's worth bearing in mind , I guess . If you 're going down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take a look at the little tyke . He 's only about four months old , though , so I would n't count on his resembling anybody . " The young deputy came back with a hot carton in a paper bag . Mungan poured black coffee for the three of us . In response to unspoken signals , the young deputy carried his into the back room and closed the door . Mungan said over his paper cup : " What I meant a minute ago , I meant the two killingswere n't connected the way you thought , by way of Campion . This is n't official thinking , so I 'm asking you to keep it confidential , but there 's some doubt in certain quarters that Campion killed Dolly . " " What quarters are you talking about ? " " These quarters , " he said with a glance at the closed door.  | " Me personally . So did Ralph Simpson have his doubts . We talked about it . He knew that he was a suspect himself , but he insisted that Campion did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who sometimes talked without knowing what he was talking about . But now that he 's dead , I give his opinion more weight . " I sipped my coffee and kept still while Mungan went on in his deliberate way : " Understand me , Lew , I 'm not saying Bruce Campion did n't kill his wife . When a woman gets herselfmurdered , nine times out of ten it 's the man in her life , her boy friend or her husband or her ex . We all know that . All I 'm saying , and I probably should n't be saying it , we do n't have firm evidence that Campion did it . " " Then why was he indicted ? " " IIe has his own stupidity to thank for that . He panicked and ran , and naturally it looked like consciousness of guilt to the powers that be . But we did n't have the evidence to convict him , or maybe even arraign him . After we held him twenty-four hours , I recommended his release without charges . The crazy son-of-a-gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting , and the D.A . rushed the case in to them and got an indictment . They never would have indicted if Campion had n't run . " Mungan added with careful honesty : " This is just my opinion , my unofficial opinion . " " What 's Royal 's unofficial opinion ? " " The Captain keeps his opinion to himself . He 's bucking for Sheriff , and you do n't get to be Sheriff by fighting the powers that be . " " And I suppose the D.A . is bucking for Governor or some-thing . " " Something . Watch him make a circus out of this . " " You do n't like circuses ? " " I like the kind with elephants . " He finished his coffee , crumpled the cup in his fist , andp173tossed it into the wastebasket . I did the same . It was a trivial action , but it seemed to me to mark a turning point in the case . " Exactly what evidence do you have against Campion ? " Mungan made a face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It boils down to suspicion , and his lack of an alibi , and his runout . In addition to which , there 's the purely negative evidence : there was no sign that the place had been broken into , or that Dolly had tried to get away from the killer . She was lying there on the floor in her nightgown , real peaceful like , with one of her own silk stockings knotted around her neck . " " In her bedroom ? " " The place has no bedroom . I 'll show you a picture of thelayout . " He went to his files in the back room and returned with several photographs in his hands . One was a close-up of a fullbreastedyoung blonde woman whose face had been savagely caricatured by the internal pressure of her own blood . The stocking around her neck was almost hidden in her flesh . In the other pictures , her place on the floor had been taken by a chalk outline of her figure . They showed from various angles a roughly finished interior containing an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen table and some chairs , a gas plate and a heater , a palette and some paints on a bench by the single large window . This window , actually the glazed door opening of the converted garage , had a triangular hole in a lower corner . Unframed canvases hung on the plasterboard walls , like other broken windows revealing a weirdly devastatedoutside world . " How did the window get broken , Pat ? " " Ralph Simpson said that it had been broken for weeks . Campion just never got around to fixing it . He was too high and mighty , too busy throwing paint at the wall to see that the wife and child got proper care . "  | " You do n't like him much . " " I think he 's a bum . I also think he 's got a fair shake coming to him . " Mungan tossed the pictures onto his desk . He took a button out of the pocket of his blouse and rolled it meditatively between his thumb and forefinger . It was a large brown button @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown threads attached to it . I 'd seen a button like it in the last few days , I could n't remember where . " Apparently the baby slept in the same room . " " There 's only the one room . They lived like shanty Irish , " he said in the disapproving tone of a lace-curtain Irishman . " What happened to the child on the night of the murder ? " " I was going to bring that up . It 's one of the queer things about the case , and one reason we suspected Campion from the start . Somebody , presumably the killer , took the baby out of his crib and stashed him in a car that was parked by the next house down the road . The woman who lives there , a Negro woman name of Johnson , woke up before dawn and heard the baby crying in her car . She knew whose baby it was  --  her and Dolly were good neighbors  --  so naturally she took it over to the Campions ' . That 's how Dolly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night , do you know ? " " IIe said he was gone all night , drinking until the bars closed , and then driving , all over hell and gone . It 's the kind of story you ca n't prove or disprove . He could n't or would n't name the bars , or the places he drove afterward . He said along toward dawn he went to sleep in his car in a cul-de-sac off Skyline . That would n't be inconsistent with him doing the murder . Anyway , we picked him up around nine o'clock in the morning , when he drove back to his place . There 's no doubt he had been drinking . I could smell it on him . " " What time was his wife killed ? " " Between three and four A.M. The deputy Coroner was outp175there by eight , and he said she could n't have been dead longer than four or five hours . He went by body temp . and stomach contents , and the two factors checked each other out . " " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Campion said they ate together at six the previous night . He brought in a couple of hamburgers some diet for a nursingmother and the carhop at the drive-in confirmed the time . Apparently he and Dolly had an argument over the food , so he took what money there was in the house and went and got himself plastered . " " What was the argument about ? " " Things in general , he said . They had n't been getting along too well for months . " " He told you this ? " " Yeah . You 'd think he was trying to make himself look bad . " " Did he say anything about another woman ? " " No . What 's on your mind , Lew ? " " I think we can prove he was lying about what he did on the night of May the fifth . Have you talked to Royal this morning ? " " He phoned to tell me he had Campion . He wants me to go over to Redwood City and take a hand in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He 's not talking at all . Royal 's getting kind of frustrated . " " Did he say anything to you about the Travelers Motel in Saline City ? " " Not a word . " Mungan gave me a questioning look . " According to their night clerk , Nelson Karp , Campion spent the night of May fifth there with a woman . Or part of the night . They registered as Mr. and Mrs. Burke Damis , which is one of the aliases Campion has been using . The Saline City police lifted the registration card last night after Campion was seen there . He seems to have been trying to set up an alibi . " " A good one or a phony ? " " You can find that out quicker than I can . " Mungan stood up and looked down the rocky slopes of hisp176face at me . " Why n't you give me the word on it in the first place ? " " I gave the word to Royal last night . He was n't interested . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , I am . But if this is no phony , why did Campion hold it out until now ? " " Ask him . " " I think I will . " He dropped the leather button he had been playing with on his desk . It rolled onto the floor , and I picked it up . " Is this part of the evidence , Pat ? " " I honestly do n't know . The baby had it in his fist when Mrs. Johnson found him in her car . She did n't know where it came from . Neither did anybody else . " I was still trying to remember where I had seen a button or buttons like it . I dredged deep in my memory , but all that came up was the smell of the sea and the sound of it . " May I have this button ? " " Nope . I read a story once about a button solving a murder , and I have a special feeling about this button . " " So have I. " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes narrowed on my face . " You sure you do n't want to borrow the use of my razor before you go ? " " I guess I 'd better . " He got the electric razor out of the bottom drawer of his desk . I took it into the washroom and shaved myself . All I uncovered was the same old trouble-prone face.  |p177MUNGAN  WAS GONE when I came out . I used his telephone to call Vicky Simpson 's house . No answer . The young deputy in the back room told me that so far as he knew Vicky was still in Citrus Junction waiting for the authoritiesto release her husband 's body . I turned in the U-drive car at the San Francisco airport , caught a jet to Los Angeles , picked up my own car at the airport there , and drove out through the wedding-smelling orange groves to Citrus Junction . I went first to see the baby . His grandmother lived on the west side of town in the waste that the highway builders had created . It was mid-afternoon when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust like tanks in a no man 's land . An overgrown pittasporum hedge shielded the house from the road . The universal dust had made its leaves as grey as aspen . The house was a two-story frame building which needed paint . Holes in the screen door had been repaired with string . I rattled it with my fist . The woman who appeared behind the screen looked young to be a grandmother . The flouncy dress she wore , and her spike heels , were meant to emphasize her slender figure . She had a blue-eyed baby face to which the marks of time clung like an intricate spider web . She was blonder than the picture I 'd seen of her daughter . " Mrs. Stone ? " " I 'm Mrs. Stone . " I told her my name and occupation . " May I come in and talk to you for a bit ? " " What about ? "  | " Your daughter Dolly and what happened to her . I know it must be a painful subject  --  " " Painful subject is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and over the same old ground . You people know who killed her as well as me . Instead of coming around torturing me , why do n't you go and catch that man ? He has to be some place . " " I took Campion last night , Mrs. Stone . He 's being held in Redwood City . " A hungry eagerness deepened the lines in her face and aged her suddenly . " Has he confessed ? " " Not yet . We need more information . I 'm comparatively new on the case , and I 'd appreciate any help you can give me . " " Sure . Come in . " She unhooked the screen door and led me across a hallway into her living room . It was closely blinded , almost dark . Insteadof raising a blind , she turned on a standing lamp . " Excuse the dust on everything . It 's hard to keep a decent house with that road work going on .

" An undersong of protest ran through everything she said , and she had reason . Grey dust rimed the furniture ; even without it the furniture would have been shabby . I sat on a prolapsedchair and watched her arrange herself on the chesterfield . She had the faintly anachronistic airs of a woman who had been good-looking but had found no place to use her looks except the mirror . At the moment I was the mirror , and she smiled into me intensively . " What do you want me to tell you ? " " We 'll start with your son-in-law . Did you ever meet him ? " " Once . Once was enough . Jack and me invited the two of them down for Christmas . We had a hen turkey and all the trimmings . But that Bruce Campion acted like he was on a slumming expedition . He hauled poor Dolly out of here so fastp179you 'd think there was a quarantine sign on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best people in town are our good friends . " " Did you quarrel with him ? " " You bet I did . What did he have to act so snooty about ? Dolly told me they were living in a garage , and we 've owned our own house here for twenty-odd years . So I asked him what he planned to do for her . When was he going to get a job and so on ? He said he married her , did n't he , and that was all the planned to do for her , said he already had a job doing his own work . So I asked him how much money he made and he said not very much , but they were getting along with the help of friends . I told him my daughter was n't a charity case , and he said that 's what I thought . Imagine him talking like that to her own mother , and her six months pregnant at the time . I tried to talk her into cutting her losses and staying here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too loyal . " Mrs. Stone had the total recall of a woman with a grievance . I interrupted her flow of words : " Were they getting along with each other ? " " She was getting along with him . It took a saint to do it and that 's what she was , a saint . " She rummaged in a sewing basket beside her . " I want to show you a letter she wrote me after Christmas . If you ever saw a devoted young wife it was her . " She produced a crumpled letter addressed to her and postmarked " Luna Bay , Dec. 27 . " It was written in pencil on a sheet of sketching paper by an immature hand : Dear Elizabeth , I 'm sorry you and Bruce had to fight . He is moody but he is really A-okay if you only know him . We appresiate the twenty  --  it will come in handy to buy a coat  --  I only hope Bruce does not get to it first  --  he spends so much on his painting  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it was in Citrus J. I realyp18oappresiate you asking me to stay ( I 'm a poet and do nt know it ! ) but a girl has to stick with her " hubby " thru thick and thin  --  after all Bruce stuck with me . Maybe he is hard to get along with but he is a lot better than " no hubby at all . " Do nt you honestly think he s cute ? Besides some of the people we know think his pictures are real great and he will make a " killing "  --  then you will be glad I stuck with Bruce . Love to JackDolly ( Mrs. Bruce Campion ) " Does n't it tear your heart out ? " Mrs. Stone said , plucking at the neighborhood of hers . " I mean the way she idolized him and all ? " I assumed a suitably grim expression . It came naturally enough . I was thinking of the cultural gap between Dolly and Harriet , and the flexibility of the man who had straddled it . " IIow did she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's the old old story . You probably know what happened . She was an innocent girl . She 'd never even been away from home before . He corrupted her , and he had to take the consequences . " She was a little alarmed by what she had said . She dropped her eyes , and added : " It was partly my own fault , I admit it . I never should have let her go off to Nevada by herself , a young girl like her . " " How old ? " " Dolly was just twenty when she left home . That was a yearago last May . She was working in the laundry and she was n't happy there , under her father 's thumb . She wanted to have more of a life of her own . I could n't blame her for that . A girl with her looks could go far . " She paused , and her eyes went into long focus . Perhaps she was remembering that a girl with her own looks had n't . Per/haps she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way out of life . " Anyway , " she said , " I let her go up to Tahoe and get herself a job . It was just to be for the summer . She was supposed to save her money , so she could prepare herself for something permanent . I wanted her to go to beauty school . She was very good at grooming herself  --  it was the one real talent she had . She took after me in that . But then she ran into him , and that was the end of beauty school and everything else . " " Did she make any other friends up at the lake ? " " Yeah , there was one little girl who helped her out , name of Fawn . She was a beauty operator , and Dolly thought very highly of her . She even wrote me about her . I was glad she had a girl friend like that . I thought it would give her some ambition . Beauty operators command good money , and you can get a job practically anywhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jack makes a fair salary at the laundry , but it 's been hard these last years , with inflation and all . Now we have the baby to contend with . " She raised her eyes to the ceiling . " I 'd like to see the baby . " " He 's upstairs sleeping . What do you want to see him for ? " " I like babies . " " You do n't look the type . I 'm not the type myself , not any more . You get out of the habit of attending to their needs . Still , " she added in a softer voice , " the little man 's a comfort to me . He 's all I have left of Dolores . You can come and take a look  --  long as you do n't wake him . " I followed her up the rubber-treaded staircase . The baby 's room was dim and hot . She turned on a shaded wall light . He was lying uncovered in the battered crib which I had seen in Mungan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't resemble anyone in particular . Small and vulnerable and profoundly sleeping , he was simply a baby . His breath was sweet.  |p182His  grandmother pulled a sheet up over the round Buddha eye of his umbilicus . I stood above him , trying to guess what he would look like when be grew up . It was hard to imagine him as a man , with a man 's passions . " This was Dolly 's own crib , " Mrs. Stone was saying . " We sent it up with them at Christmas . Now we have it back here . " I heard her breath being drawn in . " Thank God his crazy father spared him , anyway . " " What 's his name ? " " Dolly called him Jack , after her father . Dolly and her father were always close . What do you think of him ? " " He 's a fine healthy baby . " " Oh , I do for him the best I can . It is n't easy to go back to it , though , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring him up properly . I guess I did n't do such a good job of bringingDolly up . " I murmured something encouraging as we started downstairs . Like other women I had known , she had the strength to accept the worst that could happen and go on from there . Moving like a dreamer into the living room , she went to the mantel and took down a framed photograph . " Did you ever see a picture of my daughter ? " " Not a good one . " The picture she showed me was an improvement on Mungan 's , but it was n't a good one , either . It looked like what it was , a small-town high-school graduation picture , crudely retouchedin color . Dolly smiled and smiled like a painted angel . " She 's  --  she was pretty , was n't she ? " " Very , " I said . " You would n't think she 'd have to settle for a Bruce Campion . As a matter of fact , she did n't have to . There were any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a regular caravan out here . Only Dolly was n't interested in the boys . She wanted to get out of Citrus for life . Besides , she alwayswent for the older ones . I think sometimes , " she saidp183quite innocently , " that came from being so fond of her father and all . She never felt at home with boys her own age . The truth is , in a town this size , the decent older ones are already married off . " " Was Dolly friends with some of the other kind ? " " She most certainly was not . Dolly was always a good girl , and leery of bad company . Until that Campion got ahold of her . " " What about her friends at Tahoe ? Were there other men besides Campion in her life ? " " I do n't know what you mean by in her life . " Almost roughly , she took the picture of Dolly out of my hands and replaced it on the mantel . With her back still turned , she said across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting at , mister ? " " I 'm trying to find out how Dolly lived before she married Campion . I understand she lost her job and got some help from friends , including Fawn King . You said she wrote you about Fawn . Do you have the letter ? " " No . I did n't keep it . " " Did she mention any other friends besides Fawn ? " She came back toward me shaking her head . Her heels made dents in the carpet . " I think I know what you 're getting at . It 's just another one of his dirty lies . " " Whose lies ? " " Bruce Campion 's lies . He 's full of them . When they were here Christmas , he tried to let on to Jack that he was n't the father , that he married her out of the goodness of his heart . " " Did he say who the father was ? " " Of course he did n't , because there was n't anybody else . I asked Dolly myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turned around and admitted it then and there . " " What did he say ? " " He said he would n't argue , said he made his bargain and he would stick to it . He had his gall , talking about her like she was a piece of merchandise . I told him so , and that wasp184when he marched her out of the house . He did n't want her talking any more . He had too much to hide . " " What are you referring to ? " " His lies , and all his other shenanigans . He was a drinker , and heaven knows what else . Dolly did n't say much  --  she never complained  --  but I could read between the lines . He went through money like it was water  --  " I interrupted her . " Did Dolly ever mention a man named Quincy Ralph Simpson ? " " Simpson ? No , she never did . What was that name again ? " " Quincy Ralph Simpson . " " Is n't that the man they found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim Rowland 's yard ? " " Yes . He was a friend of your daughter 's . " " I do n't believe it . " " He was , though . Simpson was the one who introduced her to Campion . After they got married , Simpson gave them a good deal of help , including financial help . " " That does n't prove anything . " " I 'm not trying to make it prove anything . But I 'm surprised that Dolly never mentioned Simpson to you . " " We did n't keep in close touch . She was n't much of a letter writer . " " When did you see Dolly and Campion last ? " " Christmas . I told you about that . " " You did n't see Campion in May ? " " I did not . Jack drove me up there the day they found her , but I shunned him like a rattlesnake . " " And he was n't here in Citrus Junction , after the police releasedhim ? " " How would I know ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have , in a sense . He may have been across the road burying Ralph Simpson . Whoever buried Simpson must have had a reason for picking the house across from yours . "  |p185She  squinted at me , as if the light had brightened painfully . " I see what you mean . " " Are you sure Ralph Simpson never came here to your house ? " " There 's no reason he should . We did n't even know him . " Mrs. Stone was getting restless , twining her hands in her lap . " But he knew Dolly , " I reminded her . " After she was killed , and you brought the baby here , he may have been watching your house . " " Why would he do that ? " " It 's been suggested that he was the baby 's father . " " I do n't believe it . " But after a pause , she said : " What kind of a man was Ralph Simpson ? All I know about him is what I read in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rowlands ' yard . " " I never knew him in life , but I gather he was n't a bad man . He was loyal , and generous , and I think he had some courage . He spent his own last days trying to track down Dolly 's mur-derer . " " Bruce Campion , you mean ? " " He was n't convinced that it was Campion . " " And you are n't , either , " she said with her mouth tight . " No . I 'm not . " Her posture became angular and hostile . I was trying to rob her of her dearest enemy . " All I can say is , you 're mistaken . I know he did it . I can feel it , here . " She laid her hand over her heart . " We all make mistakes , " I said . " Yes , and you made more than one . I know that Bruce Campionwas the baby 's father . Dolly would n't lie to me . " " Daughters have been known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if this Simpson was the father , why did n't he marry her ? Answer me that . " " He was already married . "  | " Now I know you 're wrong . Dolly would never mess with a married man . The one time she did  --  " Her eyes widened as though she had frightened herself again . She clamped her mouth shut . " Tell me about the one time Dolly messed with a married man . " " There was no such time . " " You said there was . " " I 'm saying there was n't . I was thinking about something entirely different . I would n't sully her memory with it , so there . " I tried to persuade her to tell me more , with no success . Finally I changed the subject . " This house across the way where Simpson was found buried  --  Iunderstand it was n't occupied at the time . " " You understand right . The Rowlands moved out the first of the year , and the house was standing empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to it and the other condemnedhouses . Some of the wild kids around were using them to carry on in . Jack used to find the bottles and the beer cans all around . They smashed the windows and everything . I hated to see it , even if it did n't matter in the long run . The State just tore the houses down anyway . " She seemed to be mourning obscurely over the changes and losses in her own life . " I hated to see them do it to the Jaimet house . " " The Jaimet house ? " She made a gesture in the direction of the road . " I 'm talking about that same house . Jim Rowland bought it from Mrs. Jaimet after her husband died . It was the original Jaimet ranch house . This whole west side of town used to be the Jaimet ranch . But that 's all past history . " " Tell me about Jim Rowland . " " There 's nothing much to tell . He 's a good steady man , runs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another stationin town . Jack always swears by Rowland . He says he 's anp187honest mechanic , and that 's high praise from Jack . " " Did Dolly know him ? " " Naturally she knew him . The Rowlands lived across the street for the last three-four years . If you think it went further than that , you 're really off . Jim 's a good family man . Anyway , he sold to the State and moved out the first of the year . He would n't come back and bury a body in his own yard , if that 's what you 're thinking . " I was thinking that you never could tell what murderers would do . Most of them were acting out a fantasy which they could n't explain themselves : destroying an unlamented past which seemed to bar them from the brave new world , erasing the fear of death by inflicting death , or burying an old malignantgrief where it would sprout and multiply and end by destroying the destroyer . I thanked Mrs. Stone for her trouble and walked across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , but their dust still hung in the air . Through it I could see uprooted trees , houses smashed to rubble and piled in disorderly heaps . I could n't tell where Rowland 's house had stood . HC4HC*-HC44HC4iC chapter 22Hc.aHC.HCaic isTHE DEPUTY on duty at the Citrus Junctioncourthouse was a tired-looking man with his blouse open at the neck and a toothpick in his mouth . A deep nirvanic calm lay over his office . Even the motes at the window moved languidly . The ultimate slowdown of the universe would probably begin in Citrus Junction . Perhaps it already had . I asked the tired man where Sergeant Leonard was . He regardedme morosely , as if I 'd interrupted an important meditation . " Gone to town on business . "  | " Which town ? " " L.A. " " What business ? " He looked me over some more . Perhaps he was estimating my Bertillon measurements . He belonged to the Bertillon era . " Anything to do with the Simpson case ? " I said . He removed his toothpick from between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We do n't discuss official business with the public . You a newspaper fellow ?

" He reinserted his toothpick in his mouth and wrote haltingly on a scratch pad . I said : " The S. ' stands for Sherlock . " He looked up from his laborious pencil work . The old crystal set he was using for a brain received a faint and far-off signal : he was being ribbed . " What did you say the first name was ? " " Sherlock . " " That supposed to be funny ? Ha ha , " he said . I started over : " My name is Archer , and Leonard will want to see me . When are you expecting him back ? " " When he gets here . " " Oh , thanks . " " You 're welcome . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the pieces flutter down onto the counter between us . " Can you give me Leonard 's home address ? " " Sure I can . But you 're the great detective . Find it for your-self . " Archer the wit . Archer the public relations wizard . I took my keen sense of humor and social expertise for a walk down the corridor . There was nobody at the information desk inside the front door , but a thin telephone directory was chained top189the side of the desk . Wesley Leonard lived on Walnut Street . An old man watering the courthouse chrysanthemums told me where Walnut Street was , a few blocks from here . Archer the bloodhound . It was a middle-middle-class street of stucco cottages dating from the twenties . The lawn in front of Leonard 's cottage was as well kept as a putting green . A stout woman who was not so well kept answered the door . Pink plastic curlers on her head gave her a grim and defiant expression . She said before I asked : " Wesley 's not here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you know when he 'll be back ? " " He 's generally home for supper . Wesley likes a good hot supper . " " What time would that be ? " " Six . We eat an early supper . " Supper was a key word in her vocabulary . " Who shall I tell him ? " " Lew Archer . I 'm the detective who brought Vicky Simpson here last Monday night . Is Mrs. Simpson still with you ? " " No . She only stayed the one night . " The woman said in a sudden gush of confidence : " Wesley 's such a good Samaritan , he does n't realize . Are you a real good friend of Mrs. Simp-son 's ? " " No . " " Well , I would n't want to insult her . She has her troubles . But it 's hard on an older woman having a younger woman in the house . A younger woman with all those troubles , it puts a strain on the marriage . " She ran her fingers over her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . " You know how men are . " " Not Wesley . " " Yes , Wesley . He 's not immune . No man is " She looked ready to be disappointed in me at any moment . " Wesley was up half the night letting her cry on his shoulder . Heating milk . Making a grilled cheese sandwich at four A.M. He has n't madep190me a sandwich in ten years . So after she woke up at noon and I gave her her lunch I tactfully suggested that she should try the hotel . Wesley says I acted hardhearted . I say I was only heading off trouble in the marriage . " " What 's she using for money ? " " Her boss wired her an advance on her wages , and I guess the boys in the courthouse chipped in some . Mrs. Vicky Simpsonis comfortably ensconced . " " Where ? " " The Valencia Hotel , on Main Street . " It had stood there for forty or fifty years , a three-story cube of bricks that had once been white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the front window . Their heads turned in unison to follow my progress across the dim lobby . It was so quiet I could hear their necks , or their chairs , creak . There was nobody on duty at the desk . I punched the handbell . It did n't work . One of the old men rose from his chair near the window and shuffled past me through a door at the back . He reappeared behind the desk , adjusting a glossy brown toupee which he had substituted for his hat . It settled low on his forehead . " Yessir ? " " Is Mrs. Simpson in ? " He turned to inspect the bank of pigeonholes behind him . The back of his neck was naked as a plucked chicken 's . " Yessir . She 's in . " " Tell her there 's someone who wants to speak to her . " " No telephone in her room . I guess I could go up and tell her , " he said doubtfully . " I 'll go . What 's her number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't like gentlemenvisitors in a lady 's room . " Somehow his toupee made this remark sound lowbrow and obscene . " I 'm no gentleman . I 'm a detective . " " I see . "  |p191He  ' and his friends by the window watched me go up the stairs . I was the event of the day . A red bulb lit the thirdfloorcorridor . I tapped on the door of 308 . " Who is it ? " Vicky said in a dull voice . " Lew Archer . Remember me ? " Bedsprings made a protesting noise . She opened the door and peered out . Her face had thinned . " What do you want ? " " Some talk . " " I 'm all run out of talk . " Her eyes were enormous and vulnerable . I could see myself mirrored in their pupils , a tiny red-lit man caught in amber , twice . " Let me in , Vicky . I need your help . " She shrugged and walked away from the open door , sprawlingon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breasts and hips stood out under her black dress like protuberancescarved from something hard and durable , wood or bone . A Gideon Bible lay open on the bed . I saw when I sat down in the chair beside it that Vicky had been reading the Book of Job . " I did n't know you were a Bible reader . " " There 's lots of things you do n't know about me " " That 's true . Why did n't you tell me Ralph was a friend of the Campions ? " " That should be easy to figure out . I did n't want you to know . " " But why ? " " It 's none of your business . " " We have business in common , Vicky . We both want to get this mess straightened out .

" " He was n't  --  not in the way you mean . " " In what way was he close to her ? " " He was more like her financial adviser , " she said in a haltingvoice . " Dolly had no use for a financial adviser . She was stony broke . " " That 's what you think . I happen to know she was loaded at the time she was killed . Ralph told me she had at least a thousand dollars in cash . She did n't know what to do with it , so she asked Ralph . " " You must be mistaken , Vicky . The Campions had no money . I was told that Ralph had to pay the doctor when their child was born . " " Ile did n't have to . He had a good day at the race track and gave them the money . When Ralph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't think I did n't put up a squawk . But she paid him back after all . " " When ? " " Just before she was killed . Out of the money she had . That 's how he financed his trip to Tahoe . " It was a peculiar story , peculiar enough to be true . " Did Ralph actually see all the money Dolly claimed she had ? " " He saw it . He did n't count it or anything , but he saw it . She asked him to take it and hold it for her , so she could make a down payment on a tract house . Ralph did n't want the responsibility . He advised her to put it in the bank , but she was afraid Bruce would find out , and it would be gone with the wind . Like the other money  --  the money she had when he married her .

" " Where did all the money come from ? " " Ralph said she got it out of a man . She was n't saying who . " " Was the man the father of her child ? " She lowered her eyes demurely . " I always thought Bruce was the father . " " Bruce denied it . " " I never heard that . " " I did , Vicky . Do you have any idea who the father was if it was n't Bruce ? " " No . " " Could it have been Ralph ? " " No . There was nothing between him and Dolly . For one thing , he had too much respect for Bruce . " " But the child was conceived long before she married Campion .

You get enough trouble in this life without coming out and asking for it . " I rose and stood over her . Late afternoon sunlight slanted in through the window . She sat rigid with her legs under her , asp194if the shafts of light had transfixed her neck and shoulders . " You were afraid Ralph killed her . " Her eyes shifted away from mine and stayed far over in the corners of her head . " Deputy Mungan made Ralph come down to the station and answer a lot of questions . Then Ralph went off to Nevada right after . Naturally I was scared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I do n't know . He was out late , and I did n't wake up when he came in . " " You still think Ralph murdered her ? " " I did n't say I thought it . I was scared . " " Did you ask him ? " " Of course I did n't ask him . But he kept talking about the murder . Ile was so upset and shaky he could n't handle a cup of coffee . This was the night after it happened . They had Bruce Campion in the clink , and Ralph kept saying that Bruce did n't do it , he knew Bruce did n't do it . " " Did Ralph see Bruce before he left for Tahoe ? " " Yeah , Bruce came to the house in the morning when they let him out . I would n't of let him in if I 'd been there . " " What happened between Bruce and Ralph that morning ? " " I would n't know . I was at work . Ralph phoned me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe Bruce went with him . He dropped out of sight that same day , and I never saw him again . A couple of days after that , the papers were full of him running away , and the Grand Jury brought in a murder conviction . " " The Grand Jury indicted him , " I said . " There 's a big differencebetween an indictment and a conviction . " " That 's what Ralph said , the day he came back from the lake . I thought a week or so away from it all would get it off his mind . But he was worse than ever when he came back . He was obsessed with Bruce Campion . " " Just how close were they ? "  | " They were like brothers , " she said , " ever since they were in Korea together . Bruce had more on the ball than Ralph had , I guess , but somehow it was Ralph who did the looking after . He thought it was wonderful to have Bruce for a friend . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he practically did more than once . " " Would Ralph give Bruce his birth certificate to get out of the country ? " She glanced up sharply . " Did he ? " " Bruce says he did . Either Ralph gave it to him voluntarily , or Bruce took it by force . " " And killed him ? " " I have my doubts that Bruce killed either one of them . He had no apparent motive to kill Ralph , and the money Dolly had puts a new complexion on her case . It provides a motive for anyone who knew she had it . " " But why would anybody want to kill Ralph ? " " There 's one obvious possibility . He may have known who murdered Dolly . " " Why did n't he say so , then ? " " Perhaps he was n't sure . I believe he was trying to investigateDolly 's murder , up at the lake and probably here in Citrus Junction .

" I do n't know nothing about it . " " That 's why I 'm telling you . The interesting thing is thatp196Ralph spent some time in the Blackwells ' lodge last May . He worked as their houseboy for a week or so . They fired him , allegedly for stealing . " " Ralph might of had his faults , " she said from her corner , " but I never knew him to steal anything in his life . Anyway , there 's no sense trying to pin something on a dead man . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pin murder on whoever killed him . You loved him , did n't you ? " She looked as though she would have liked to deny it and the pain that went with it . " I could n't help it . I tried to help it , but I could n't stop myself . He was such a crazy guy , " she murmured , so softly that it sounded like an endearment . " Sometimes when he was asleep , when he was asleep and out of trouble , I used to think he was beautiful . " " He 's asleep and out of trouble now , " I said . " What about the bundle of clothes he brought back from Tahoe ? " " There was no bundle of clothes , there was just the coat . He had this brown topcoat with him . But I know he did n't steal it .

It was real good tweed , importedlike . Harris tweed , I think they call it . It must of cost a hundred dollars new , and it was still in new condition . The only thing the matter with it , one of the buttons was missing . " " Can you describe the buttons ? " " They were brown leather . I wanted to try and match the missing one so he could wear it . But he said leave it as it was , he was n't going to wear it . " Tears glistened in her eyes . " He said he was n't going to wear it and he was right . " " Did he bring it with him when he came down south ? " " Yeah . He was carrying it over his arm when he got on the bus . I do n't know why he bothered dragging it along with him . It was warm weather , and anyway it had that button missing . "  | " Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The top one . " She pointed with her thumb between her breasts . I wished I had Mungan 's button with me . I remembered now where I had seen other buttons like it , attached to a coat that answered Vicky 's description . One of the girls in the zebrastripedhearse had been wearing it . I DROVE BACK to the coast and hit the surfing beaches southward from the fork of Dal and loi Alternate . Some of the surfers recalled the black-and-white hearse , but they did n't know the names of any of the occupants . Anyway they claimed they did n't  --  they 're a closemouthed tribe . I had better luck with the Highway Patrol in Malibu . The owner of the hearse had been cited the previous week end for driving with only one headlight . His name was Ray Buzzell , and he lived in one of the canyons above the town . " Mrs. Sloan Buzzell " was stenciled on the side of the rustic mailbox . An asphalt driveway zigzagged down the canyon side to her house . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof , cantilevered over a steep drop . A small Fiat stood in the double carport , but there was no hearse beside it . A violently redheaded woman opened the front door before I got to it , and stepped outside . Her hard , handsome face was carefully made up , as though she 'd been expecting a visitor . I wondered what kind of visitor . Her black Capri pants adhered like oil to her thighs and hips . The plunging neckline of her shirt exhibited large areas of chest and stomach . She was carrying a half-full martini glass in her hand and , to judge by herp198speech , a number of previous martinis inside of her . " Hello-hello , " she said . " Do n't I know you from somewhere ? " " I 'm just a type . How are you , Mrs. Buzzell ? " " Fine . Feen . Fane . " She flexed her free arm to prove it , and inflated her chest , which almost broke from its moorings . " You look sort of beat . Come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you drink . " " " Quantities , but not at the moment , thanks . I 'm looking for Ray . " She frowned muzzily . " People are always looking for Ray . Has he done something ? " " I hope not . Where can I find him ? " She flung out her arm in a gesture which included the whole coast . From the height we stood on , we could see a good many miles of it . The sun was low in the west , and it glared like a searchlight through barred clouds . " I ca n't keep track of my son any more , " she said in a soberer voice . " I have n't seen him since breakfast . He 's off with his crowd somewhere . All they care about is surfing . Some weeks I do n't set eyes on him for days at a time . " She consoled herself with the rest of her martini . " Sure you wo n't come in for a drink ? I just made a fresh shaker , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be smasherooed . " " Pour it out . " " The man is mad . " She studied my face with exaggerated interest . " You must be a wandering evangelist or something . " " I 'm a wandering detective investigating a murder . Your son may be able to help me . " She moved closer to me and whispered through her teeth : " Is Ray involved in a murder ? " " That I doubt . He may have some information that will help me . Are you expecting him home for dinner ? " " I never know . Sometimes he 's out all night with his crowd . They have bedrolls in the hearse . " She burst out angrily : " I could kill myself for letting him buy that thing . He prac/tically lives in it . " Her mind veered back to the point . " What do you mean , he has information ? " " I said he may have . " " Who was murdered ? " " A man named Simpson , Quincy Ralph Simpson . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did Ray , I 'm sure . " I said : " When Simpson was last seen alive by his wife , he was carrying a brown Harris tweed topcoat with brown leather buttons ; the top button was missing . That was two months ago . The other day I saw one of the girls in Ray 's crowd wearing that topcoat , or one exactly like it . " " Mona ? " " She was a big chesty blonde . " " That 's Ray 's girl , Mona Sutherland . And the coat is his , too . I know it well . His father gave it to him the last time Ray visited him , so you see you 've made a mistake . It 's a differentcoat entirely . " " Now tell me where Ray really got it , Mrs. Buzzell . " The manifestations of mother love are unpredictable . She threw her empty glass at my head . It missed me and smashed on the flagstones . Then she retreated into the house , slamming the door behind her . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , a narrowingred lozenge on the cloud-streaked horizon . It slipped out of sight . The whole western sky became smoky red , as if the sun had touched off fires on the far side of the world . After a while the front door opened . The lady appeared with a fresh glass in her hand . " I 've just been talking to my ex on the long-distance telephone . He 'll back me up about the coat . " " Bully for him . " She looked at the glass in her hand as if she was consideringthrowing it , too . But it had liquor in it . " What right have you got sitting on my property ? Get off my property ! "  |p200I  turned the car and drove up past her mailbox and parked at the roadside and watched the horizontal fires die out and the dark ' Come on . The sky was crowded with stars when the woman came out again . She plodded up the slope and balancedher teetering weight against the mailbox . " I 'm smasherooed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to pour it out . " " I could n't do that to good gin . It 's been my dearest friend and beloved companion for lo these many yea-hears . " She reached for me like a blind woman . " I 'm frightened . " " I did n't mean to frighten you , and I do n't believe your son is involved in this murder . But I have to know where he got the tweed topcoat . His father had nothing to do with it , did he ? " " No . Ray told me he found it . " " Where ? " " On the beach , he said . " " How long ago was this ? " " About two months . He brought it home and brushed the sand out of it . That 's why I got so frightened , on account of the timing . You said two months . That 's why I lied to you . " She was leaning on me heavily , one hand on my shoulder , the other clutching my upper arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder anyone , " she said . " He 's a little hard to regiment but he 's not a bad boy really . And he 's so young " " He 's not a murder suspect , Mrs. Buzzell . He 's a witness , and the coat is evidence . How he got it may be significant . But I ca n't establish that without talking to him . You must have some idea where I can find him . " " He did say something this morning  --  something about spending the night at Zuma . I know he took along some things to cook . But what he says and what he actually does are often two different things . I ca n't keep track of him any more . He needs a father . " She was talking into the front of my coat , and her grip had tightened on me . I held her for a bit , because she neededp201holding , until a car came up the road and flashed its headlightson her wet startled face . The striped hearse was standing empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parked behind it and went down to the beach to search for its owner . Bonfires were scattered along the shore , like the bivouacs of nomad tribes or nuclear war survivors . The tide was high and the breakers loomed up marbled black and fell white out of oceanic darkness . Six young people were huddled under blankets around one of the fires . I recognized them : one of the girls was wearing the brown tweed coat . They paid no attention when I approached . I was an apparition from the adult world . If they pretended I was n't there , I would probably go away like all the other adults . " I 'm looking for Ray Buzzell . " One of the boys cupped his hand behind his ear and said : " Hey ? " He was an overgrown seventeen- or eighteen-year-old with heavy masculine features unfocused by any meaning in his eyes . In spite of his peroxided hair , he looked like an Indian in the red firelight . " Ray Buzzell , " I repeated . " Never heard of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anybody ever hear of a Ray Buzzell ? " " I never heard of a Ray Buzzell , " the girl in the coat said . " I knew a man named Heliogabalus Rexford Buzzell . He had a long grey beard and he died some years ago of bubonic plague . " Everybody laughed except me and the girl . I said to the boy : " You 're Ray , are n't you ? " " Depends who you are . " He rose in a sudden single movement , shedding his blanket . The three other boys rose , too . " You fuzz ? " " You 're getting warm , kid . " " Do n't call me kid . "  | " What do you want me to call you ? " " Anything but kid . " " All right , Mr. Buzzell . I have some questions to ask you , about the coat Miss Sutherland is wearing . " " Who you been talking to ? How come you know our names ? " He took a step toward me , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grouped themselves behind him . They crossed their arms on their chests to emphasize their muscles , and the red firelight flickered on their biceps . With a little judo I thought I could handle all eight of their biceps , but I did n't want to hurt them . I , was an emissary from the adult camp . I flashed the special-deputy 's badge which I carried as a souvenir of an old trouble on the San Pedro docks . " I 've been talking to your mother , among other people . She said you found the coat on the beach . " " Never believe her , " he said with one eye on the girls . " Never believe a mother . " " Where did you get it then ? " " I wove it underwater out of sea lettuce . I 'm very clever with my hands . " He wiggled his fingers at me . " I would n't go on playing this for laughs , Buzzell . It 's a serious matter . Have you ever been in Citrus Junction ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you stop over long enough to kill and bury a man ? " " Bury a man ? " He was appalled . " His name was Quincy Ralph Simpson . He was found buriedin Citrus Junction last week , with an icepick wound in his heart . Did you know him ? " " I never heard of him , honest . Besides , we 've had the coat for a couple of months . " His voice had regressed five years , and sounded as though it was changing all over again . He turned to the girl . " Is n't that right , Mona ? " She nodded . Her sea-lion eyes were wide and scared . With scrabbling fingers she unbuttoned the coat and flung it off . Ip203held out my hands for it . Ray Buzzell picked it up and gave it to me . His movements had lost their certainty . The coat was heavy , with matted fibers that smelled of the sea . I folded it over my arm . " Where did you get it , Ray ? " " On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . It was salvage , like . I 'm always living off the beach , picking up salvageand jetsam . Is n't that right , Mona ? " She nodded , still without breaking silence . His voice rushed on in an adolescent spate : " It was soaked through , and there were stones in the pockets , like somebody chunked it in the drink to get rid of it . But there was a strong tide running , and the waves washed it up on the beach . It was still in pretty good condition , this Harris tweed is indestructible , so I decided to dry it out and keep it . It was like salvage . Mona wears it mostly  --  she 's the one that gets cold . " She was shivering in her bathing suit now , close by the fire . The other girl draped a plaid shirt over her shoulders . The boys were standing around desultorily , like figures relaxing out of a battle frieze . " Can you name the beach ? " " I do n't remember . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know which one it was , " Mona said . " It was the day we had the six-point-five and I was scared to go out in them and you all said I was chicken . You know , " she said to the others , " that little private beach above Malibu where they have the shrimp joint across the highway . " " Yeah , " Ray said . " We ate there the other day . Crummy joint . " " I saw you there the other day , " I said . " Now let 's see if we can pin down the date you found the coat . " " I do n't see how . That was a long time ago , a couple months . " The girl rose and touched his arm . " What about the tide tables , Raybuzz ? " " What about them ? "  | " We had a six-point-five tide that day . We have n't had many this year . You 've got the tide tables in the car , have n't you ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the beach to the zebra-striped hearse . Ray found the dog-eared booklet , and Mona scanned it under the dashboard lights . " It was May the nineteenth , " she said positively . " It could n't have been any other day . " I thanked her . I thanked them both , but she was the one with the brains . As I drove back toward Los Angeles , I wondered what Mona was doing on the beach . Perhaps if I met her father or her mother I could stop wondering . THE BLACKWELL HOUSE was dark . I pressed the bell push , and the chimes inside gave out a lonely tinkling . I waited and rang again and waited and rang and waited . Eventually I heard footsteps inside . The veranda light went on over my head , and the little maid looked out at me sleepily . She was out of uniform and out of sorts . " What do you want ? " " Arc the Blackwells in ? " " She is . He is n't . " " Tell her Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't do that . She 's in bed asleep . I was asleep myself . " She yawned in my face , and hugged her rayon bathrobe more closely around her . " You go to bed early , Letty . " " I had to get up early this morning , so I thought I might as well catch up on my rest . Mrs. Blackwell took some sleepingp205pills and left strict orders not to be disturbed . She went to bed right after dinner . " " Is Mrs. Blackwell all right ? " " She said she had a blinding headache but she gets those from time to time . " " How many sleeping pills did she take ? " " A couple . " " What kind ? " " The red kind . Why ? " " Nothing . Where 's the lord and master ? " " He left early this morning . He had a phone call , about Miss Harriet , and he made me get up and make breakfast for him . It is n't a regular part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut in on her explanations : " Do you know where he is now ? " " He went up to Tahoe to help them search for her body . That 's where the phone call was from . " " They have n't found her , then ? " " No . What do you think happened to her ? " " I think she 's in the lake . " " That 's what he said . " She stepped outside , partly closing the door behind her . " He was in bad shape at breakfast . He could n't eat he was so broken up . I did n't think he should go off there by himself . But he would n't let me wake up Mrs. Blackwell , and what could I do ? " She crossed the veranda and looked up at the stars . She sighed , and laid a hand on her round pink rayon bosom . " How long have you been working for the Blackwells ? " " Two months . It seems like longer . I mean with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mrs. Blackwell ? " " They 've had their share . But it do n't behoove me to talk about it . " " " Do n't they get along ? " " They get along as well as most , I guess . A-course they'vep206only been married eight or nine months . It 's the long pull that counts , my daddy says , and the Colonel must be twenty years older than her . " " Is that an issue between the Blackwells ? " " No , I do n't mean that . Only it makes you wonder why she married him . Mrs. Blackwell may have her faults , but she 's not the gold-digging type . " " I 'm interested in what you think of her and her faults . " " I do n't talk behind people 's backs , " she said with some spirit . " Mrs. Blackwell treats me good , and I try to treat her good back . She 's a nice lady to work for . He is n't so bad either . " " Did they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was before I started with them . Just my luck . They were talking about going up again in September , but it 's probably all off now . They would n't want to stay in the lodge so soon after what happened there . I would n't want to my-self . " " Were you fond of Harriet ? " " I would n't say that . I never saw much of her . But I felt kind of sorry for her , even before this happened . She was a real sad cookie , even with all that money . It 's too bad she had to die before she had any happiness in life . She put on a pretty good front , but you ought to seen the crying tantrums she threw in the privacy of her own room . My mother is a practical nurse , and I tried to calm her down a couple of times . " " What was she crying about ? " " Nobody loved her , she said . She said she was ugly . I told her she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she could n't see it . This was in June , before she went to Mexico . It 's easy to understand why she was such a pushover for that artist guy  --  the one with all the names that murdered her . " She looked at the stars again , and coughed at their chilliness . " I think I 'm catching cold . I better get back to bed . You never can tell when they 'll get you up around here . " She went back into the dark house . I went down the hillp207and turned left on Sunset toward my office . I drove automaticallyin the light evening traffic . My mind was sifting the facts I 'd scraped together , the facts and the semi-facts and the semidemi-semi-facts . One of the semi-facts had become a certainty since I 'd learned that the tweed coat had been found near the Blackwells ' beach house : the Blackwell case and the Dolly Campion case and the Ralph Simpson case were parts of one another . Dolly and Ralph and probably Harriet had died by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify the hand . I spread it out on the desk in my office and looked at it under the light . The leather buttons were identical with the one Mungan had shown me . Where the top one had been pulled off there were some strands of broken thread corresponding with the threads attached to Mungan 's button . I had no doubt that an identification man with a microscope could tie that button and this coat together . I turned the coat over , scattering sand across the desk and the floor . It had a Harris label on the right inside breast pocket , and under it the label of the retailers : Cruttworth , Ltd. , Toronto . My impulse was to phone the Cruttworth firm right away . But it was the middle of the night in Toronto , and the best I could hope for was a chat with the night watchman . I searched in vain for cleaners ' marks . Perhaps the coat had never been cleaned . In spite of its rough usage on the beach , the cuffs and the collar showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was small for me , tight across the chest . I wondered how it would fit Campion . It was a heavy coat , and a heavy thought , and I began to sweat . I struggled out of the coat . It hugged me like guilt . I knew a man named Sam Garlick who specialized in identifyingclothes and connecting them with their rightful owners in court . He was a Detective Sergeant in the L.A.P.D. His father and his grandfather had been tailors . I called Sam 's house in West Los Angeles . His mother-in/law informed me that the Garlicks were out celebrating their twenty-second wedding anniversary . She was looking after the three smaller children , and they were a handful , but she 'd finally got them off to bed . Yes , Sam would be on duty in the morning . While the receiver was in my hand , I dialed my answering service . Both Arnie Walters and Isobel Blackwell had called me earlier in the day . The most recent calls were from Sergeant Wesley Leonard and a woman named Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Hatchen . Harriet 's mother . The long loops were intersecting , and I was at the point of intersection . I put in a call to the Santa Monica Inn . The switchboard operator told me after repeated attempts that Mrs. Hatchen 's room did n't answer . The desk clerk thought she 'd gone out for a late drive . She had checked into a single late that afternoon . I returned Leonard 's call . He answered on the first ring . " Sergeant Leonard here . " " Archer . You wanted to talk to me ? " " I thought you wanted to talk to me . The wife mentioned you were here this afternoon . " " I had some evidence that should interest you . I have more now than I had then . " " What is it ? " " The coat Ralph Simpson had with him when he left home . I 'm hoping it will lead us to the killer . " " How ? " he said , rather competitively . " It 's a little complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I concur . I 've got something hotter than the coat . " He was a simple man , and simple pride swelled in his voice . " So hot I ca n't even tell you over the phone . " " Do you come here or do I go there ? "  | " You come to me . I have my reasons . You know where I live . " He was waiting for me on the lighted porch , looking younger and taller than I remembered him . There was a flush on his cheeks and a glitter in his eyes , as if the hotness of his evidence had raised his temperature . I suspected that he was letting me in on it because he secretlydoubted his competence to handle it . He had anxiety in him , too . He pumped my hand , and seemed to have a hard time letting go . Mrs. Leonard had made lemonade and egg-salad sandwiches , and laid them out on a coffee table in the small overfurnishedliving room . She poured two glasses of lemonade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the kitchen , shutting the door with crisp tact . I had forgotten to eat , and I wolfed several sandwiches while Leonard talked . " I 've found the murder weapon , " he announced . " I did n't find it personally , but it was my own personal idea that led to its disclosure . Ever since we uncovered Simpson 's body , I 've had a crew of county prisoners out there mornings picking over the scene of the crime . This morning one of them came across the icepick and turned it in . " " Let me see it . " " It 's down at the courthouse , locked up . I 'll show it to you later . " " What makes you certain it 's the weapon ? " " I took it into the L.A. crime lab today . They gave it a test for blood traces , and got a positive reaction . Also , it fits the puncture in Simpson 's body . " " Any icepick would . " " But this is it . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate of sandwiches . " I had to be sure , and I made sure . " " Fingerprints ? "  | " No . The only prints were the ones from the prisoner that found it . It was probably wiped clean before the murderer stuck it in the dirt . I 've got something better than fingerprints . And worse , in a way . " " You 're talking in riddles , Sergeant . " " It 's a riddle for sure . " He glanced at the closed door to the kitchen , and lowered his voice . " The icepick was part of a little silver bar set which was sold right here in town last October . I had no trouble tracking down the store because there 's only the one good hardware store here in town . That 's Drake Hardware , and Mr. Drake identified the icepick personallytonight . He just had the one set like it in stock , and he remembered who he sold it to . She 's a local citizen  --  a woman my wife has known for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand as if he was back on traffic point duty . " Not so fast . I do n't know that I 'm justified telling you her name . It would n't mean anything to you , anyway . She 's a Citrus Junction woman , lived here all her life . Always had a clean record , till now . But it looks dark for her , or maybe her husband . There 's more than the icepick tying them into the murder . They live directly across the road from the site where we found the icepick and the body . " " Are we talking about Mr. and Mrs. Stone ? " He looked at me in surprise . " You know Jack and Liz Stone ? " " I interviewed her this afternoon . He was n't there . " " What were you doing  --  questioning her about the Simpson killing ? " " We discussed it , but I did n't consider her a suspect . We talked mostly about her daughter Dolly  --  and what happened to her . " Leonard made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Stone couple . The way I figure it , psychologically speaking , the murder of their girl could of drove them over the edge.  |p211Maybe  Simpson had something to do with that murder , and they killed him in revenge . " " It 's a possible motive , all right . Simpson was definitely involved with Dolly and her husband . Have you questioned the Stones ? " " Not yet . I just got Mr. Drake 's identification of the icepick tonight . I talked it over with the Sheriff and he says I should wait until the D.A . gets back from Sacramento . He 's due back tomorrow . We would n't want to make a serious mistake , the Sheriff says . " Clear sweat , like distilled anxiety , burst out on his forehead . " The Stones are n't moneyed folks but they 've always had a good reputation and plenty of friends in town . Liz Stone is active in the Eastern Star . " He took a long gulp of lemonade . " Somebody ought to ask her about the icepick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hands are tied until the D.A . gets back . " " Mine are n't . " He regarded me appraisingly . Clearly he was asking himselfhow far he could trust me . He tossed down the rest of his lemonade and got up . " Okay . You want to take a look at it first ? " We rode in my car to the courthouse . The icepick was in Leonard 's second-floor office , where a map of Citrus County took up one whole wall . He got the thing out of a locker and set it on the table under a magnifying glass on a flexible arm . A tag bearing Leonard 's initials was wired to the handle , and the wire sealed with lead . The square-cut silver handle felt cold to my fingers . The point of the icepick was sharp and dirty , like a bad death . " There 's a corkscrew that goes with it , part of the set , " he said . " If Liz and Jack Stone have the corkscrew , it ties it up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would use a silverbar set , or any kind of a bar set ? "  | " I never heard that they drank , but you never can tell . One of them could be a secret drinker . " " Secret drinkers do n't fool around with fancy accessories . Do I have your permission to show them this thing , and ask for an explanation ? " " I guess so . " He wiped his forehead . " Long as you do n't go to them in my name , I guess it 's all right . But do n't make any accusations . We do n't want them to panic and go on the run . " I let him out on the sidewalk in front of his house and drove to the west side . The Stones had an upstairs light on . The man who came to the front door was in his pajamas . He was a thin man with bushy sandy hair and defeated eyes . " Mr. Stone ? " ' Tessin " " I had some conversation with your wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " he said in a flat voice . " Yes . I 'd appreciate a few minutes more with your wife , and with you , too . " " I du n no , it 's getting pretty late . Mrs. Stone is on her way to bed . " He glanced up the stairs which rose from the hallway . " Is it about Dolly ? " " It 's connected with Dolly . " " Maybe I can handle it , eh ? " He squared his narrow shoulders . " It was a terrible sorrow to my wife what happened to Dolly . I hate to see her dragged back to it all the time . " " I 'm afraid it 's necessary , Mr. Stone . " He took my word for it and went upstairs to fetch her , climbing like a man on a treadmill . They came down together wearing bathrobes . He was holding her arm . Her face and neck were shiny with some kind of cream or oil . " Come in , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorstep , Jack . It is n't polite . " We went into the living room , where the three of us stood and looked at each other . The awkwardness developed into tension . The woman pulled at the oily skin of her throat.  | " What brings you here so late ? Have you found something out ? " " I keep trying , Mrs. Stone . " I got the icepick out of my pocket and held it out by the tip . " Have you seen this be-fore ? " " Let me look at it . " She reached out and took it from me by the handle . Her husband leaned at her shoulder , one arm around her waist . He seemed to depend on physical contact with her . " It looks like the one you bought for Mrs. Jaimet , " he said . " I believe it is . What 's this little wire tag doing on it ? " " It 's just to identify it . Where did you buy it , Mrs. Stone ? " " At Drake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Mrs. Jaimet as a wedding gift . Jack thought I spent too much money on it , but I wanted to get her something nice for once . She was alwaysgood to us and Dolly . Twelve dollars was n't too much for all she 's done . " Her eye was on her husband , and she was speaking more to him than to me . " It cost sixteen , " he corrected her . " I work all day for sixteen dollars take-home . But I 'm not kicking . She was a good friend to Dolly . " His wife took up the sentiment and breathed more life into it . " She was wonderful to Dolly , a second mother . Remember when Dolly used to call her Aunt Izzie ? Not every woman in Izzie Jaimet 's position would permit that , but she 's no snob . She gave our Dolly some of her happiest hours . " They clung to each other and to this warm fragment of the past . The icepick in her hand brought her back to the sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I sent it to Mrs. Jaimet for a wedding gift . She does n't even live in town any more . " " She used to live in town ? " " Right across the road , " Stone said . " We were neighbors with the Jaimets for close to twenty years . She sold out to the Rowlands after Jaimet died , and moved to Santa Barbara.
