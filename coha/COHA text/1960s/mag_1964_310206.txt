The British like to insist that , more than most nations , they must trade in order to live . Lately they have been trading as never before ; their exports rose to a record $11.4 billion in 1963 . But Britons have also been living it up as never before . With more money to spare than ever , British consumers are indulging their taste for foreign luxury goods , and British businessmen are importing huge amounts of raw material to keep their expanding factories busy . After months of nervously watching the spectacle , Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home and his financial agents were alarmed when January 's figures showed that Britain 's trade gap had widened to the largest ( $460 million ) in history . Last week the government took action to dampen Britain 's spending spree by raising interest rates from 4% to 5% . <P> By making money dearer , the government hopes 1 ) to discourage British businessmen from expanding too rapidly and importing too much , and 2 ) to force them to resist new wage increases demanded by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imports . Higher interest may be the answer for Britain 's current ills , but it is bad news for the U.S. Though the U.S. gold outflow has been wrestled under control in the past five months , Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon recently urged European countries not to raise their interest rates this year , to avoid attracting dollars from the U.S. With the British bank rate now 1% above the U.S. rate , many investors will be tempted to place their money in Britain .
