The old man sat at a table in an RCA Victor recording studio in Manhattan and listened to a playback . The cello came on with a rhapsodic , throbbing solo . " Very beautiful , " sighed the old man , and tapped Cellist David Soyer approvingly on the knee . Then , a gnarled passage for piano and strings . " No , " said the old man , " that 's not so good . Here Brahms makes a trap , and we fell in . What shall we do ? " <P> <P> Violist Michael Tree offered a suggestion . " Maybe , " he told the old man , " you could come in a little slower , maybe more quietly . " Violinist John Dalley agreed with a nod . " Fine , " said the old man , " let 's try it . " And Artur Rubinstein , a month short of his 81st birthday , led three members of the Guarneri Quartet , whose average age was 36 , back to the microphones for another try at Brahms 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began what has become his annual New York endurance contest , this time in the form of nine Carnegie Hall recitals in seven weeks . Those few pianists half his age with the stamina for such a task would likely spend months in agonizing preparation for the ordeal ; Rubinstein walked away from the whole problem , instead took down from a dusty shelf the three Brahms Piano Quartets that he had not played publicly or privately for over a decade , and got them back into his fingers and heart for the recording sessions . Why this , rather than brushing up on the concert programs ? " It was like coming back to old friends , " he explained during the session . " It filled me with music . " <P> <P> No Generation Gap . It filled him , too , with wisdom about youth and old age . " When I was young , I would play Brahms like this " - and the wrinkled hands moved across the keyboard in a caricature of overexpressive stop-and-go phrasing . " The lesson we learn as we get old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the passage , impeccable , simple and restrained . " Brahms learned this too . See how luxuriant , how extravagant he writes here " - pointing to a page black with notes from the Quartet , written when Brahms was 28- " and how , later on , the single , simple notes can sing alone " -a pass at the misty , half-muttering Intermezzo in E Flat Minor of 31 years later . " My concert programs are full of familiar pieces , comfortable like old shoes , but there , too , I try each time to make them a little better . " <P>
