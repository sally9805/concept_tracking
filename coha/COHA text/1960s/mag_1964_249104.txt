Man of the Year <P> Sir : Fifteen of us were arrested at a restaurant on the outskirts of this " progressive " little North Carolina town . Our crime was attempting to order Sunday dinner-or , in local parlance , " trespassing " in a " public " restaurant . Twelve of us are black , three white . <P> A young lady who had refused bail and been imprisoned here for 16 days , refusing to eat the food sent in to us by a segregated restaurant , went out on bond . She returned an hour later as a " visitor , " her arms laden with hamburgers and coffee , her steps somewhat wavering from her fast and her eyes shining . Tucked among her gifts to us was the latest issue of TIME , with the painting of Rev. King under the banner : Man of the Year . <P> Thank you . <P> KATHRYN J. NOYES <P> Chapel Hill <P> Jail Chapel Hill , N.C. <P> <P> Sir : I love you for making such a great decision . It took courage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Year dominates all others . <P> JOHNNYE W. KING <P> New York City <P> <P> Sir : It is my opinion that if King had not flitted from one city to another stirring up trouble , there would not have been the deaths and trouble in the country today due to the integration . <P> He should have been jailed as soon as he arrived in the different Southern cities , for he was there only to incite violence . <P> JOHN A. LAIRD <P> San Mateo , Calif . <P> <P> Sir : In all my 30-plus years of reading TIME , even when I myself made your pages , I have never been so glowingly proud of you as a magnificent force as I was for your choice and your write-up of the Man of the Year . <P> MORRIS KAPLAN , M.D. <P> Denver <P> <P> Sir : I was so incensed when I saw your selection of the Man of the Year that I felt like putting my magazine into the wastebasket . <P> KATHRYN GUNN <P> Lisbon , Ohio <P> <P> Sir : Yours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ REV . ) THOMAS HARRIS <P> Methodist Rural Center <P> Kapit , Sarawak <P> <P> Sir : I am astounded that a race racketeer should become Man of the Year . <P> TED KURLOW <P> Cleveland <P> <P> Sir : I am bewildered . In memory of President Kennedy , cancel my subscriptions . <P> MRS . C. W. LETZGUS <P> Okemos , Mich . <P> <P> Sir : It is without doubt that many will feel that your naming of Dr. King as Man of the Year is somewhat lacking in consideration of the man whose recent death has touched us all so very deeply . I can not help feeling , though , that were he still alive , Mr. Kennedy would have more than enthusiastically applauded your choice of the man who has so eloquently and effectively devoted himself to the battle for civil liberties . It is a battle that Mr. Kennedy not only fought so hard for , but believed in so fervently . You have indeed honored the spirit of Mr. Kennedy , which remains among us , as you have honored Dr. Martin Luther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N.Y . <P> <P> Sir : Americans who travel abroad and are often shamed over questions concerning civil rights in America will rejoice as they read your Jan. 3 issue . <P> I plan to send several copies to friends abroad . I want to thank you for this constructive contribution to our continuing struggle for human rights . <P> S.
