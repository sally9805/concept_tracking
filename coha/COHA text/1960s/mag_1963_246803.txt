The Friday night crowd at Long Island 's Roosevelt Raceway was in a festive mood . In the grandstand , beer cans rattled and pari-mutuel machines beat a steady thunk , thunk , thunk . In the Cloud Casino , champagne corks popped and waiters served steaks . For some , it was just a night at the races . But most were drawn there by a fantasy of instant wealth . <P> Just two nights before , Joseph Mariano , 39 , a Waterbury , Conn. , bartender , had made an alltime record killing $79,660.30 on a $2 ticket-by picking four straight winners in Roosevelt 's " twin double . " Now , as eight pacers raced toward the finish of the sixth race , 23,127 fans clutched their own twin doubles ( 85,574 of them ) and prayed for Lady Luck to come through again . <P> In the back stretch , one pacer stepped into the wheel of an opponent 's sulky , stumbled-and in an instant the track was littered with horses and drivers . Only two entries managed to skirt the pile-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed onto the track to administer to the writhing animals and cart an injured driver off to the hospital . But when the track paid off on the two that finished and voided tickets on the six fallen horses-all legitimate according to the rules-horror turned to unreasoning anger . <P> " We was robbed ! " came the battle cry . A youth hurdled a 3-ft. fence onto the track , brandished a fist-and hundreds swarmed after him . They attacked the judge 's booth at the finish line , injuring John DeMatteo , who was pinned inside . They threw bottles at the infield tote board until the lights that indicate the amount of money bet finally winked out . They pulled a sulky from the paddock and set it afire . Bands of vandals dashed wildly through the stands , breaking windows , lighting bonfires , ripping program booths apart . <P> Within minutes , 150 police converged on the track in 50 radio cars Frenzied rioters beat one patrolman nearly to death . Conrad Rothengast 65 , Roosevelt 's security chief and onetime chief of New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack . For more than an hour the battle raged on . When it was finally quelled , 35 people were injured , 15 fans were arrested , and damage to Roosevelt Raceway was estimated at more than $15,000.
