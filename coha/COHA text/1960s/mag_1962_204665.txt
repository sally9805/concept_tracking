In most respects , Bloomington , Ill. ( pop . 36,800 ) , is a typical bustling Midwestern market city . The one thing that makes Bloomington a bit different from the run-of-the-mill county seat is the presence of its largest employer , the State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co . This week State Farm will report that its premium income for the first half of this year was up nearly 11% to $281 million , and that in May the company signed up its seven millionth policyholder . All this handily helped State Farm hold its rank as the world 's largest automobile insurance company . <P> Despite its big-time business . State Farm glories in the corn-and-cows atmosphere into which it was born in 1922 . Though it operates in 50 states and Canada , the company has never considered moving its headquarters out of Bloomington , and all but one of its twelve directors still live in surrounding McLean County .

As business increased , the company put up its own office building , but soon overflowed that into a funeral parlor , a ballroom and a warehouse .

For years afterward , State Farm personnel applications included the question : " Do you roller-skate , and how well ? " <P> 30% Off . Mecherle had a revolutionary approach to insurance . By choosing customers among farmers and good-risk professions and charging " membership fees " to cover initial policy costs , he was able to scale as much as 30% off conventional auto insurance premiums . He insisted that his agents work only for State Farm , but in return , the company took over all their paperwork and payments collections : the arrangement left the agents free to sell , and has cut State Farm 's **27;12977;TOOLONG ratio to 19.1% , second best in the industry after Liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
