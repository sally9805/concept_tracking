In Hartford 's sweltering red brick Bushnell Memorial Hall , delegates fidgeted and fussed . At 1:34 in the morning , after 10 hr. and 49 min. and eight roll calls , Connecticut Republicans finally selected Insurance Executive John Alsop as their candidate for Governor . Next day , tired and irritable , they took just one decisive muster to smash the comeback attempt of former Governor-Diplomat John Davis Lodge , who wanted to be their nominee for the U.S. Senate . <P> Shimmies &; Bagpipes . The convention had all the show of a national nominating conclave . As each of the six candidates for Governor was nominated , his partisans paraded under television floodlights . Fifty girls in white blouses and short blue skirts kicked and shimmied for Edwin H. May Jr. , former state Republican chairman . <P> A bagpipe band babbled for Conservative State Senator John Mather Lupton . <P> Strategists for May and Connecticut House Speaker Anthony Wallace even used short-wave radio to guide their staffs - but sadly discovered that each could overhear the other . <P> As the polling began , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 38 . <P> Alsop , whose writing brothers Stewart and Joseph watched the voting with him on television in a backstage dressing room , had narrowly missed the nomination in a more relaxed convention in 1958 . <P> May , a boy-wonder Congressman at 32 . <P> had stressed his organizational ability in a skillful campaign across the state , now personally directed his supporters on the floor . With 328 votes needed for the nomination , the first ballot gave Alsop 226 , May 202 and Wallace 101 . <P> As the night wore on , three candidates withdrew , but Wallace stood fast , hopeful that he might become the compromise choice . Backstage , the candidates ' tacticians huddled , vainly seeking deals that might break the deadlock . On the sixth ballot , Wallace began to slip . The May forces tried to get a recess until morning to gain time to persuade Wallace to with draw and throw his votes to May . Uncomfortable and hungry , the delegates in sisted with rhythmical clapping that the voting continue . On the seventh Wallace was down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 302 . Foreseeing the end , Wallace withdrew , and on the eighth ballot Alsop was nominated , 337 to May 's 317 . Puffing contentedly on a black pipe , Alsop dismissed the rift in the party , said : " I 'm a pretty good patcher . " Exit . The long count pushed the convention into an unscheduled third day to select a candidate to succeed Republican Senator Prescott Bush , 67 , who had an nounced only four weeks ago that he did not have the physical strength to seek and serve another term . Immediately . <P> Lodge , who had been a candidate for Governor , decided to try for the Senate instead - but refused to get out and work for it . Said he to a friend before the con vention : " I just ca n't go out and shake Lodge , people 's and hands I 'd and like say your ' I 'm vote . ' It John Davis would be insulting to them . They know who I am . " Far from aloof was Horace Seely-Brown Jr. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's agricultural eastern Second District . Seely-Brown , who runs a 100-acre apple farm in Pomfret , likes meeting people . He covered 3,000 miles in the state , pleaded persuasively for delegate votes .
