While President Nixon prepared for his swing through the capitals of Western Europe , Eastern Europe last week marked a melancholy milestone . Six months have passed since Warsaw Pact tanks rumbled into Czechoslovakia , but Communism 's East Bloc still remains uneasy and uncertain . <P> Like Western Europe , Eastern Europe is pulling apart . It is torn by resurgent nationalism and the desire to trade with the West . These trends run directly counter to the interests of the Soviet Union , which seeks to dominate the bloc 's economic activities through Comecon , the Communist equivalent of the Common Market , and to control political developments through Moscow-dominated Communist parties . But Comecon is a failure , and the Soviet attempt to impose its will on Czechoslovakia now appears to have created more problems than it solved . <P> Spring Maneuvers . By their invasion of Czechoslovakia , the Soviets arrested , for a time at least , the spread of liberal reforms and forced the country to return more or less to the practice of orthodox Soviet-style Communism . But the Soviets failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloc . That failure , along with the defection of the West European Communist parties , is sure to cause further reverberations if the oft-postponed world Communist summit actually does convene in May in Moscow . <P> The invasion , in fact , only widened the schisms in Eastern Europe . After an initial period of intimidated silence , the Rumanians , the only active Warsaw Pact members that did not participate in the invasion , have become more outspoken than ever against Russian domination in Eastern Europe . Displeased , the Soviets in turn are pressing to hold Warsaw Pact maneuvers in Rumania this spring . Last week Soviet Marshal Ivan Yakubovsky , the Warsaw Pact commander , and Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister Vasily Kuznetsov , until recently the Russian viceroy in Prague , visited Bucharest for a chat with Rumanian leaders . <P> Spring maneuvers could bring dangerous tensions to the Balkans . Yugoslavia 's President Josip Broz Tito , who had been enjoying a rapprochement with the Soviets , has withdrawn to his old neutralist stance and begun to strengthen his country 's defenses . The Hungarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Czechoslovak episode revived the country 's own memories of a far more harsh repression 13 years ago . In hopes of escaping a second crackdown , the Hungarians are keeping the political trappings in place , but at the same time are quietly pursuing cultural and economic reforms .
