txt LETTERS : AIRLINE CONFUSION GEORGE SUHR.R . LEWIS WACHTELL.ERNEST STRAUSSERERNST HARTMANA.S. pg . XX5 LETTERS : AIRLINE CONFUSION To the Travel Editor : yOUR , article in the Dec. 31 Travel Section was another of the excellent , insight-laden eye openers on the amazing confusion that exists within airlines circles , and I do hope you will continue to report to the public on these utterly fantastic events . As I see it , the trans-Atlantic carriers are continuing to follow a course that seems to lead them farther and farther away from putting their operations on a paying basis in spite of the fact that they have working possibilities that no other industry has had since the passing of present antitrust laws , firstly because of their monopolistic International Air Transport Association , and secondly , because they seem , to be getting 90 p , er cent of the revenue needed to operate on a breakeven basis , with practically no sales efforts at all . And in spite of these advantages , they are nearly all operating at a loss . Having flown over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can express some pretty general impressions on some of the reasons for a lack of enthusiasm on the part of the public , to whom it would seem that several trans-Atlanntic carriers are being badly mismanaged . Make of Aircraft The usual approach in advertising , with the expenditure of many millions of dollars , is to tell the public which make of aircraft the company uses , although it must be obvious that even the most sophisticated air traveler cares little whether he flies a Boeing or Douglas plane , as long as it is the modern , wonderful jet equipment . Although much has been done to improve and expedite checkin procedures for flights , the few minutes saved here have little value in relation to the excessively long ground transportation time to and from airports . It is quite obvious that airports must usually lie some distance from the city served , but a speeding up of services is possible in many cities , and ' . could cut the over-all transportation time considerably . It still seems unreasonable that international passengers must check in at airports one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrate my point , here is the time schedule for a recent flight I made from New York to London : MINUTES Check-in , East Side Terminal 15 Wait for bus 22 Bus ride to Idlewild 45 Wait at Idlewild , boarding plane 48 Flight Idlewild-London 370 Transportation , plane to terminal 18 Waiting to go through Customs 12 Waiting for baggage ( fast in ' London ) 8 Going through Customs z 16 Waiting for bus ti.  - -  Lordon  --  depari 14 Bus ride to East London Air Terminal 40 Deboarding and waiting for taxi ... ? , II ' Taxi , Air Terminal to Hotels 26 Total 645 Of the total 645 minutes , the actual flight took only 370 . This trip was one of the few when actually very little time was " : wasted " by irregularities . Reader Scores Carriers On Rates , ServicesI.A.T.A . Criticized There would , however , seem to ' be plenty of room for improvement . Naturally , the greatest boon to the trans-Atlantic traffic would be a real reduction of prices , even if this would necessitate the non-stop servicing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an airline of my preference , I have often voluntarily accepted a slightly longer flight pattern by flying non-stop to a city and continuing on a connectig inter-European flight . If necessary , for rate reductions , I am sure the public would accept a system whereby passengers were " pooled " by airlines , so that the carriers would have the opportunity of utilizing their capacity to a higher degree * * * . GEORGE SUER . Chatham , N. J. ONE CANCELED TRIP To the Travel Editor : Bravo for your perceptive piece on trans-Atlantic air fares . * * * You might be interested in knowing that I have already raised my own small voice in protest . The revelation , a few weeks ago , of all this Bermudian gobbledygook has been the basis of my decision to cancel my next spring 's European vacation , for which flight reservations had already been made . Incidentally , in terms of loss of revenue , to the airlines , I think I should point out that the canceled trip is not just one trip , but rather one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In other words , until they come to their senses , the airlines will continue to go without my business . I am enclosing a copy of the letter I sent to my travel agent , copies of which have been sent also to the American Society of Travel Agents and the two airlines involved . And I intend to send copies to several of the foreign government tourist bureaus , pointing out the fact that business in their respective countries will also lose out . Perhaps some sort of pressure can be exerted on the , airlines that way , too . It is my hope that other air travelers will make themselves heard in sufficient numbers to convince the carriers that a serious second thought is indicated , and quickly . Again , a sincere bravo to you ' for leading off with a giant ! step in the right direction . R. LEWIS WACUTELL . New York MONKEY BUSINESS To the Travel Editor : I would like to congratulate you on your excellent article " I. A. T. A. Voting on New Fares . " How right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. A. T. A. committee  --  meeting in Bermuda . on between the Civil Aeronautics . Board and the I. A. T. A. , between I. A : T. A. and the airlines and between the airlines and the travel agents . These new fare regulations will cause the travel industry and the traveler , our client , Imore suffering . We have asked for extension of the excursion fare for twentyone .. days instead of seventeen days now , but all year round . Now the traveler may not be I able to take advantage of the reduced fare on week-ends from May to Aug. 31 eastbound , and westbound not from Aug. 1 to Sept. 30 . How senseless is such a restriction ! And how senseless and worthless are the proposed regulations for group travel . There will be only the same " monkey business " as there is now in the charter-flight business . Something has to be done to protect the travel industry , one of the biggest industries in the United States , and to protect the traveler . And it could be done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ERNEST STRAUSSER , President , Murray Hill Travel Service , Inc . New York . IN AGREEMENT To the Travel Editor : May I congratulate you on the splendid article you had Dec. 31 on the various innovations which have been submitted to the I. A. T. A. carriers . I could not agree more with everything you said and particularly enjoyed the treatment you gave to some of the more ridiculous aspects of the matter . I felt that I owed you this letter in view of the fact that I did not in the past always agree with everything you have written . ERNST HARTMAN , Vice President , Frames-Tours , Ltd . ? New York . ' WHITE ' SIGNS To the Travel Editor : I have just got back from an enjoyable , though brief , trip to Miami Beach via auto , following Route 301 down and the " Ocean Hi-way " back . Certain signs that I saw en route left an indelible impression . For example , south of Brandywine , Md. , we were about to stop ? at a roadside restaurant when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whites Only . " We patronized another restaurant instead , and hope that all other tourists will do likewise . On Florida 's new Sunshine State Parkway , we stopped at a service station to use the rest rooms , and were confronted with signs : " White Men , " etc. the ' ' ? NOrfolk ferry , observed that the dining room was ; ? pot . segregated , but were pained to ? see the word " White " on some-'of the ' rest rooms . Is it too much to expect that such signs will be eliminated , and what they stand , for , too , and soon ? A. S. - Brooklyn , N. Y. . ? There is a cat-arid-mouse play
