John Kennedy has often fussed about an inequity in international journalism . Nikita Khrushchev , through private interviews with such traveling U.S. pundits as Walter Lippmann , Drew Pearson and the New York Times 's Cyrus L. Sulzberger , has communicated his views to the U.S. newspaper public ; Kennedy himself has had no such access to the Russian people . But last week the President finally got a chance , and a good one . In the first presidential interview ever granted a Russian newsman , he talked for two hours with Aleksei Adzhubei , who is both editor of Izvestia and Khrushchev 's son-in-law . <P> The idea for the interview originated with White House Press Secretary Pierre Salinger , who suggested it to Russian press attachs . Word eventually came back that Khrushchev liked the notion , and Adzhubei duly presented himself at Hyannisport , along with Interpreter Georgi Bolshakov , editor of the Russian English-language magazine U.S.S.R. He brought along a doll for Caroline Kennedy and , for John Jr. , another doll with weighted bottom that returned upright each time it was punched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Adzhubei . " You can keep pushing it down , but it will always come up . " <P> While a White House stenographer and U.S. interpreter monitored the conversation , Adzhubei and Kennedy discussed Berlin , disarmament , nuclear testing and foreign trade . At talk 's end , Kennedy apologized for having let it run too long . " No , " said his guest , " our people are used to reading long stories . " Talking later to U.S. newsmen , Adzhubei remained in good humor . The 37-year-old editor gave a thumbnail sketch of himself : " According to the American doctrine , I met the pretty daughter of the man who was to become Premier . That 's how my career started . " He bristled at suggestions that his interview would be cropped in Izvestia , promised it would run in full , probably this week . ' ' Will the interview make a difference in the relations between the two countries ? " Adzhubei was asked . " Yes , " said he firmly , " for the betterment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
