When Bud Powell left Manhattan for Paris in 1958 , his friends prayed that the change of locale might somehow exorcise the demons that had plagued him for much of his life . Instead , Powell sank even deeper into his private inferno . After five years abroad he was a shattered , empty-eyed hulk , a stranger to himself and his music . When friends finally placed him in a hospital outside Paris a year ago , he was suffering from tuberculosis , alcoholism , malnutrition and other legacies of hard living . Doctors said that he would not recover for at least three years . But Powell progressed rapidly , was soon transferred to a convalescent sanatorium where he spent long hours at the piano and wrote his first new music in six years . <P> Up from Limbo . Yet , amazingly , last week Bud Powell , now 39 , was back on the U.S. jazz scene , cured of TB and fat as a Burgermeister . The homecoming was staged at Birdland , New York 's famed jazz temple , which after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 8 ) has returned to hosting modern jazzmen . The metamorphosis was complete when Powell forcefully struck the first chords of The Best Thing for You Is Me . His attack was robust and sure , erupting in a series of crashing , dissonant chords , then retreating in flights of delicate melodic figures . His forehead awash with perspiration , head bobbing to the driving beat , he loosed a cascade of lush , intricate , tragically orchestrated chords and weeping melodies in Like Someone in Love , punctuated by his urgent gasps and moans . <P> Ill or well , Powell has long been the unchallenged master of the jazz ballad . The extraordinary virtuosity and spine-chilling passion that gained him that title years ago were only flickeringly evident at his Birdland opening . But his audience vociferously agreed that he was still a master , his performance a giant step up from limbo . <P> A State of Grace . Since 1939 , when Powell first soared to prominence as a 15-year-old boy wonder , his entire career has been a long , tense battle with drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth of bop at Minton 's Playhouse in New York , toured with Cootie Williams ' Orchestra . Then in 1945 he suffered the first of a series of breakdowns that have kept him in and out of mental hospitals ever since . He formed his own trio in 1949 and was soon the dominant pianist in jazz and the idol of a generation of followers . Then he cracked up and spent 1951-53 in a hospital . He rarely played well again . <P> The architect of Powell 's recovery has been Francis Poudras , a 29-year-old commercial artist from Paris , who is Bud 's most devoted fan and fulltime guardian angel . Poudras lives with Powell , doles out his food and money , protectively escorts him everywhere to keep him on the straight and narrow . " People say Bud is crazy or lost or silent . " says Poudras , " but he is really in a state of grace . " Powell still spends most evenings sitting quietly alone , smiling to himself , wrapped in a cocoon of benign silence . Yet to anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seems to have undergone a miracle cure . On good days now he even chats happily . For the first time in years , his message is hopeful : " Please tell everybody that Bud 's O.K. , and he 's feeling fine and is ready to play . "
