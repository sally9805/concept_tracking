Modern technology has spawned a new kind of instrument maker . The old craftsmen of music worked with wood , strings and valves ; the new ones hook up wires , transistors and wave generators . The sounds the new products make are not echoes of the human voice but a bizarre collection of buzzes , bleeps and squawks . Nonetheless , the men responsible for them are the potential Stradivaris and Steinways of electronic music , and their forbiddingly complex instruments are made for the musicians of the future-who are destined to be as much composer-technicians as performers . <P> Foremost among the new instrument makers is Robert Moog , 34 , an amateur musician with a Ph.D . in engineering physics from Cornell . The electronic synthesizer that bears his name -a 4-ft. - long contraption that looks like the control panel of a jet airliner with an organ keyboard grafted onto it-is by far the most effective device yet developed to produce electronic sounds . Besides serving as an " orchestra " for works by avant-garde composers , the Moog ( rhymes with vogue ) produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows and the clarion call that heralds Westinghouse television commercials . The most spectacular application of the Moog to date is Composer Walter Carlos ' electronic " orchestration " of ten Bach compositions for a Columbia LP called Switched-On Bach . The album has sold nearly 150,000 copies in four months , which makes it the hottest classical LP since Van Cliburn 's 1958 version of Tchaikovsky 's First Piano Concerto . The album 's widespread appeal bears out what Composer John Eaton says of Moog : " He has brought electronic music out of the lab and into our lives . " <P> The basic elements of Moog 's machine are amplifiers , mixers , filters anc voltage-controlled oscillators . Some ol these , connected to the keyboard , trigger various " raw " sounds , such as " sawtooth " waves and " white noise . " Other parts then modify the raw sounds by controlling their attack , volume and rate of decay , and by adding such characteristics as vibrato or echo . Complicated combinations of sounds-like the counterpoint and chords of Carlos ' Bach album-are achieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then combining them on multiple tracks of the same tape . <P> The Moog 's great distinctions are its size , price-$6,850 for a professional model-and vastly improved flexibility over earlier synthesizers ( the first one , built by RCA in 1955 , was a room-size monster that cost approximately $100,000 ) . Because its voltage controls can precisely " shape " tones as they are being produced , the Moog affords more spontaneous variations of sounds than other comparable synthesizers , and far more subtlety and musicality.
