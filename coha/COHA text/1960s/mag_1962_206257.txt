As the Kennedy Administration assaulted Capitol Hill last week with a bundle of legislative requests , signs of restiveness appeared among Democrats in both the Senate and the House . The President 's personal popularity with the voters was obvious . Yet the mail in Congressmen 's boxes was running heavily against many of his programs . And though Kennedy had a clear majority in both houses , his programs were clearly in trouble . <P> Many party regulars were willing to blame the President for at least part of the trouble . They are worried that he too often proposes legislation that he expects to be defeated-such as public-school aid , an urban affairs department at Cabinet level and a sweeping antirecession program-primarily to create campaign issues . To such men , Kennedy seems to be less interested in a bill 's substance than in a label that appeals to voting blocs , such as the aged on medical care . More than one loyal Democrat is complaining that in his fascination for political maneuvering , Kennedy is neglecting the fundamental chore of giving active leadership to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCormack has repeatedly had to ask the President for guidance on just what he really wanted-or would settle for . <P> Apart from legislative issues , there was a vaguely defined feeling of discontent with the President that one loyal leading House Democrat described as " the malaise . " Its cause : a suspicion that the President is more involved in preparing to win big himself in 1964 than he is with the immediate problems of Democrats who will run in 1962 . In fact , many Democrats feel that with Brother Ted 's announcement for the Senate , the so-called Kennedy dynasty is looming too large for comfort , and is bound to give the Republicans ammunition . <P> Strong evidence of the Democrats ' restiveness is the fact that they willingly let Carl Vinson , chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and a long time party bulwark , threaten a floor fight over the RS-70 long after the President and Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara expressly announced their opposition to expanding the bomber program . Congressional Democrats may thus be serving notice on President Kennedy that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay them more dutiful attention .
