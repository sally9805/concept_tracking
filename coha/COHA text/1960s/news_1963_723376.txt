Critics said the investigation was a failure because only one of 19 bills it produced was enacted . But it spelled trouble for Tammany , it led to greater deportations of gangsters , and it brought about raceway and other regulation aimed at taking the profit out of crime . The investigation led to the prosecution of some gamblers and racketeers and exposed the connection between political rings and professional criminals in some cities . Helped further by his book " Crime in America , " recounting his experiences as a crime investigator , the Senator was talked of as a Presidential possibility . A Formidable Campaigner In 1952 and 1956 he was a candidate for the Democratic nomination for the Presidency , winning the Vice Presidential nomination in 1956 . As Adlai E. Stevenson 's running mate , he was considered the nominee 's strongest asset in his unsuccessful effort to defeat President Dwight D. Eisenhower . What made Mr. Kefauver an asset was not his oratory but his personality .

He was 6 feet 3 inches tall and weighed 220 pounds . He focused all his attention on the voter through heavy black-rimmed spectacles . In his many primary campaigns , he would say in his soft voice , " My name is Estes Kefauver . I 'm running for President of the United States . I hope you 'll help me . " Then he would pump the voter 's hand . A ready handshake and a folksy , easygoing chat were the hallmarks of his approach , which lost nothing in his schoolboyish awkwardness . Once , in a melee , he found the hand he was wringing.was his wife 's .

He was one of the most liberal of Southern legislators , an advocate of civil rights for Negroes before it became a practical issue . He was also an internationalist with a keen grasp of foreign affairs and a serious student of labor and social legislation . He was criticized by many in the South for his readiness to support Supreme Court decisions on desegregating the public schools . He had publicly disagreed with an anti-Court manifesto signed by 19 other Southern Senators . His critics in the Senate privately called him " Estes the Martyr , " the " Frontiersman " and the " Scourge of Sin . " They accounted him a canny politician bent on building up a personal following even at the expense of his party ( he tried to cash in on Republican criticism of President Harry S. Truman in 1952 by basing his nomination campaign on " elimination . of waste and extravagance and a stronger lead in b cleaning up wrongdoing in government " ) .

But this criticism rarely was voiced publicly , and then only in the heat of campaigning . Carey Estes Kefauver was born July 26 , 1903 , on a 600-acre farm near Madisonville . Tenn. , 70 miles northeast of Chattanooga and ; 50 miles southwest of Knoxville . His father was a dairy farmer and hardware dealer who was the perennial ( unpaid ) Mayor of the town . Young Estes early dropped the first name . On his father 's side , his family had come to America from Alsace - Lorraine , settling in Maryland and then in the Great Smoky foothills during the Indian Wars of the 18th century . his grandfather , the Rev. Jacob Peter Kefauver , was a Baptist preacher given to two-hour sermons . The old man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an Estes , one of the families that settled in Tennessee in colonial days . Even as a child Estes Kefauver was serious and thoughtful , ? One of his teachers in Madisonville , H. L. Callahan , dug up a family anecdote about how Estes , , when 4 years old , watched his Aunt Charlotte 's dog bark vociferously at every leap while chasing a rabbit across a field . Estes shook his head and commented , " If Laddie would quit barking so much and save his breath , he could run faster and catch the rabbit . " During his boyhood he was the tag-along of his older brother , Robert . Estes was considered the sweetest child by the family , Robert the brightest . Then , when Estes was 11 , Robert was stricken while swimming . Other boys pulled Robert out , but Estes worked desperately to help revive his brother . A few days later Robert died in convulsion . Estes brooded for months . A new ambition ended his mourning . " I felt , " he said later , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents for his loss . " At the University of Tennessee he was elected president of the student body edited the college paper , played tackle on the varsity football team and did well with the discus and as a high jumper on the track team . Summers he worked in a factory . His mother was a member of a family noted in Renaissance Italy , taking its name from the family seat in Tivoli , Villa d'Este . She wrote him every day , instilling the moral righteousness that he was later to project as a national leader . " Leave no tender word unsaid , " was one admonition . Another was , " Do good while life shall last . " The Victorian sentiments colored his adult thinking . After graduation in 1924 , he taught high school mathematics and did athletic coaching in Hot Springs , Ark. , for a year . Then he enrolled in the Yale Law School , waiting on tables , tending furnaces and doing odd jobs to pay his way . Graduated in 1927 , he entered law practice in Chattanooga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the relative died . Mr. Kefauver earned $800 in independent practice and tutoring the first year . Winning a case from a leading lawyer , he was invited to join his opponent 's firm , He did and soon had a flourishing insurance , corporation and banking practice . As a bachelor in Chattanooga he was a bon vivant , a role hard to reconcile with his retiring manner . One evening in 1934 he went on a blind date and met Nancy Patterson Pigott , daughter of Sir Stephen Pigott , American-born manager of a Clydebank shipbuilding concern . They were married in 1935 . They had three daughters and adopted a son , David . Got Political Start in 1938 Senator Kefauver got his start n politics in 1938 in a group of *oung men interested in modernizing Chattanooga 's county government . The Governor prevailed on him in 1939 to serve as his finance commissioner to modernize the state 's fiscal administration . Then , in 1939 , a special election to the House of Representatives came up . He gave up his commissionership and law practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he saw a chance to move to the Senate when the Democratic leader in Memphis , Ed Crump , fell out with the incumbent . Mr. Crump put advertisements in the papers comparing Representative Kefauver to a deceiving pet coon . Mr. Kefauver seized on this . Donning a coonskin cap , he told his audiences , " I may be a pet coon , but I 'll never be Mr. Crump 's pet coon . " The coonskin cap became a fixture of the Kefauver campaigns until his second try for the Presidential nomination . It added a Lincolnesque aura to his image . But Senator Kefauver always wore it with a sheepish grin and dropped it when it began to look too contrived for a big city lawyer and politician . He won the Democratic nomination for Senator in 1948 , and the election , by a substantial plurality , getting 40 per cent of the vote . This contributed to the downfall of the Crump dynasty . Arrived in Washington , the new Senator began campaigning for the crime investigation . Once he had the $150,000 appropriation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reelected to the Senate , defeating machine candidates each time . In his first campaign for the House he pledged adherence to Franklin D. Roosevelt 's New Deal . He held to that line in eight years in the House and 15 in the Senate . In the House he was also interested in proposals to streamline and modernize the machinery of Congress . This interest led to the book , " 20th Century Congress . " In the House he was also active on the Small Business Committee . He carried this interest forward with his election as chairman of the Senate Antitrust and Monopoly Subcommittee . His investigation of consumer prices in a variety of industries led to the conviction of leading business executives on price-fixing charges and to legislation for the regulation of the drug industry . Among the Southern contingent in Congress he was a maverick . He early supported antipoll-tax and anti-lynching legislation , as well as the Supreme Court decision outlawing segregation in public schools .
