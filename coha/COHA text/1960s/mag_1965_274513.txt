" I , for one , can not stand by while the decline and fall of New York continues headlong , " said Manhattan 's Republican Representative John V. Lindsay , and , so saying , announced his candidacy for mayor against Democrat Robert Wagner . <P> The reaction was extraordinary . For the rest of the week , New York City newspapers filled whole pages with accounts of Lindsay 's activities . Editorialists and columnists extolled his virtues . Lindsay 's candidacy , said the New York Times , " means that for the first time in years , the minority party is presenting a candidate who offers a real choice to the voter , who will fight a real contest , and who has a real chance to win . " The Post 's Doris Fleeson called Lindsay " a great thoroughbred with breeding and heart . " All 13 of Lindsay 's fellow G.O.P. Congressmen from New York issued a statement telling of the city 's vital need for " the bold and vigorous and understanding leadership that a John Lindsay can give . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the right candidate in the right election in the right year . " And Republican Senator Jack Javits seemed almost beside himself . Terming Lindsay 's candidacy " potentially very important to the G.O.P. nationally , " Javits added : " If we make good in New York , it should have a fantastic effect on the country and contribute great strength to the progressive Republican cause everywhere . " <P> The Man Who Has Everything . Who was all the shouting about ? John Vliet ( his mother 's surname ) Lindsay is certainly a most attractive politician . He is young-43 . He is tall ( 6 ft. 3 in. ) and handsome , with a pleasant smile and a rapid tongue . He comes from a proper Manhattan family-his father was an investment banker-and he went to the right schools : St. Paul 's , Yale , and Yale Law . As a Navy lieutenant , he came out of World War II with five battle stars . He has a showcase family , including wife Mary , three daughters and a five-year-old son . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City-of having refused to support Barry Goldwater for President . <P> And he is a remarkable vote getter . Since 1959 , he has represented Manhattan 's so-called " silk stocking " district ; it includes Park Avenue , Fifth Avenue and Sutton Place , but it also embraces the seamier realms of Green wich Village and the East Side . In his first election he won by only 7,800 votes . He has vastly increased that margin every time since , and in 1964 he had an 81,000-vote plurality . <P> To New York City Republicans , generally a sorry lot , Lindsay looked like the man who had everything . But the G.O.P. had an awful time getting Lindsay to run for mayor . Last March he announced that he would not be a candidate , giving as his reason the fact that congressional business would prevent him from waging an all-out campaign .
