 | It was Monday , April 1 , this year , when my son Michael stood before the Federal District Court in Little Rock , Arkansas , and spoke in a calm , clear voice . " I can not , in all conscience , consent to concur with the Selective Service System for it is inconsistent with my belief that men should not kill , and that submission to the System in any form whatsoever would be admitting to the slavery that human relationships should be fostered through violence and not through love . " He had refused the services of a lawyer ; he refused to make a plea . The trial took an hour and a half , and when the jury came back , they had found him guilty of violating the Selective Service Act . The judge sentenced him to three years in the Federal Penitentiary at Springfield , Missouri . Michael nodded his head . He felt no bitterness toward the court , nor even toward the prosecuting attorney . ( " You were only doing what you had to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . I sat there and I saw and heard it all , and I thought , Dear Lord , what a bewildering thing it is for a mother to bear a child and witness all that might happen in so short a time ! I did not cry .

John . and I had tried to prevent this in every way we could , but there was no way to stop him ,  | for Michael was Michael and it was himself he was speaking for . Like Martin Luther , he said to the court : " Here I stand , I can do no other . " I thought only how beautiful he was . How beautiful he was from the day he was born . He was the sweetest , friendliest child imaginable . His crib was by the window and he would stand there talking to strangers who passed in the street .

Michael was a bright child ; he had a very high IQ and got excellent grades in school . He was a good athlete and , though he was smaller than his classmates , he played on the football team . When he was twelve , he went to the Kiwanis Boys ' Club Camp and was named the Best All-Around Camper . That was the kind of boy he was . And now he is in the Federal Penitentiary in Springfield , Missouri . There was nothing in my life or my background to prepare me for this . I was born in Little Rock , Arkansas . My father 's parents came here after the Civil War to raise a family . My mother 's family had settled in northern Arkansas . My husband had a similar history ( his family came here in 1878 ) , and we were playmates on the same street . My husband 's people , the Voglers , lived in the same house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having many children . @# I was brought up Catholic and I believed in the teachings of the Church . I have always been a conservative person , never prone to any wildness in thought or action . I never took much interest in the affairs of the world ; my first vote , as I recall , was in 1952 , for General Eisenhower . I believed in the greatness of this country and its devotion to a highly moral way of life . My husband grew up much the same . He enlisted in 1940 and served ably in the Air Force in the China-BurmaIndia theater as an aircraft armorer with the ground crew . We were married in 1944 on his furlough . Michael was born in 1945 , the first of our twelve children . I raised them all as a strict , protective parent . I believe in disciplining children and imposing rules and regulations , though always in an atmosphere of love . I am a loving person and I know they have felt that . I wanted them to have a religious education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had much money , but we learned to live on what we had . My husband , John , has worked for the United States Postal Delivery Service for the last thirteen and a half years , making around $7,500 a year . It 's not much , but we pay for what we buy and , except for the mortgage on our home , we never buy on installments . Fortunately , John is handy with tools and loves to use them . He can keep a discarded television set and a $300 used car going for years . We always managed to put some money away for bonds or insurance , even if it was only fifty cents a week .  | The children have grown up with hand-me-down clothes and toys and books , and only occasionally got something new of their own . They all worked at odd jobs ? when they became old enough ? from newspaper routes to baby-sitting , and thus had a little spending money of their own . I have always felt we had almost everything we really needed and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe the children ever thought of themselves as deprived in any way . We were a closely knit family , and , whenever possible , we did things together ? like trips in the ' 58 Olds for a picnic or a visit to the zoo . Times like these were the center of John 's life , for his job was not inspiring . They were important to all of us . There have been no rebels from our home , no runaways , no emotional separations . When a child went away to school , we all kept in constant contact . We 're a family of letter writers , and everyone knows what and how everyone else is doing . And for all the occasional squabbling and screaming , there is a never-ending love among us . I always thought we were a normal family in most ways , larger than most , to be sure , but otherwise pretty average . Michael grew up warm and friendly and at peace with the world . Like myself , he was conservative , perhaps even more so than I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1964 , and though he was not yet old enough to vote , he favored Goldwater : Michael believed in simple moral solutions and did not trust what he thought of as President Johnson 's political maneuvering . And when he was eighteen , he registered for the draft like any other boy . There was no crisis then . When he was at Little Rock University , he was immediately classified 2-S ? deferred because he was a student . He was happy at school , especially good in mathematics , and during the summer he found an excellent job with the Superior Transportation Company , making three dollars an hour , which was far more than his father was making . It was at school that his thinking began to change . As a member of the campus Newman Club for Catholics , he came into contact with Father James Drane , a controversial young priest who questioned many of the old teachings of the Church ? everything from birth control to Papal infallibility . Then , too , there was the Wesley Foundation , which was led by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Michael began spending a lot of time there . This is Baptist country , but the students today no longer recognize the old religious boundaries . They all came together and started a coffeehouse , The Exit , it was called , and it became the center of their social and intellectual lives . They played Bob Dylan and folk-rock records , and discussed the serious issues of their times . Michael eventually quit his job at Superior and took a low-paying job as a clerk at the Wesley Foundation . He was twenty years old and chang-  | ing all right . He would tell us all the new ideas that were running through his head , especially about the war in Vietnam . He felt that the American position , with its bombing of villages and northern cities , and the use of napalm which scorched earth and people , was an immoral one . I must say , at first I was shocked . It all seemed so radical , and I would argue with him . I felt that , as horrible as all wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to preserve the freedom of the Vietnamese , that the bombing was necessary to cut the supply lines to the south , a simple military tactic . We began to argue frequently , not only about the war , but also about what I felt was the breakdown of too many of the old disciplines . I felt that Michael and his friends were rebelling just for the sake of rebelling . If they were told to go to church on Sunday , they would n't go . They 'd say , why Sunday ? Why not Wednesday ? And they 'd go on Wednesday instead . I resisted that sort of freedom , in the belief that there simply had to be rules and regulations . Then he decided to become a conscientious objector to the war . I had felt something like that coming , but my husband was shocked . Michael was deeply involved in his beliefs , I could see that , but I could also see the dangers involved , and I tried to convince him of them . His dedication was so sincere , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would challenge him on every position he took , from the morality of our involvement in Southeast Asia to the philosophy of nonviolence . At times , I deliberately took an extreme position in opposition to him , just to force him to think clearly and defend himself . These arguments went on and on over the winter months , and , sometimes , they were loaded with emotions that seemed terribly powerful . But argue we did , and Michael never faltered . He was a grown man of twenty , and he was involved with the world as he saw it . He was always reading books and magazines , and , with his friends , constantly debating the issues . He knew what he wanted . In April , 1967 , Michael , having diligently prepared a speech to present his case , was able to convince the threeman draft board that he was a genuine C.O. He was awarded a 1-0 classification ( religious conviction against killing ) , and received a complete military exemption . He would be assigned to civilian duty at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aide to tubercular patients . Needless to say , the situation created quite a stir in Little Rock . While there were very few people who endorsed Michael 's position , I was happy to find that there were no nasty phone calls from cranks and no poison-pen letters . Though my friends disapproved , they commiserated with me . They said : " Oh , he 's just going through a phase ; he 'll get over it . " Which is exactly what I hoped would happen . Most of the parents in the PTA at the school my younger children attend are from the nearby air base and I expected more severe reactions , but even there the mothers were all very supportive and friendly . Michael , however , did anything but " get over it . " In August , he went to a Catholic youth camp in Tivoli , New York , and he came home with a new and even more rebellious stand against the war . Again , we argued . Every idea he had was exposed to my attack . Every position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a quiet per-  | son . He refrained from engaging in these debates , but I would go over them with him afterward and he would help me to be firm in my stand . But it was n't easy . For , curiously , it was then not Michael , but I , who began to change . I realized anew how beautiful he was , beautiful in the inner sense , motivated by love and concern for others . It was the same with his friends . Our home was always open to them , and Michael would frequently bring one or two of them home with him . I confess I am not a good housekeeper ? I have been afflicted with phlebitis since giving birth to my last two children and have had several operations on varicose veins in recent years ? and the appearance of our home has suffered . But not the feeling in it . Everyone was welcome ? especially during those last troubled years , because I knew how important it was to keep open all the channels of communication . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a result . I came to know him better through his friends as well . Yes , some wore beards and dirty clothes ; they renounced the disciplines of society and rejected its moral structure ; some of them were so antagonized by violence , they rejected all forms of killing , even the slaughter of animals . Not only would they not eat meat , they would not wear leather or fur in any form . The trouble is , so many adults see these strange-looking boys with their disheveled hair and far-out clothes and they ca n't see beyond the beards and jeans . They do n't talk to them . They do n't listen to them . I have found that these kids are idealistic and pure . They may be misguided , but they certainly deserve to be heard . Yes , I changed . I did not become a pacifist and I do not reject the system by which we all live , but I came to understand why my son does . I can feel for him and love him for his beliefs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them . Those who say that such boys are cowards because they will not go to war do n't know what they are saying . I am fully convinced it takes a far greater courage and honesty and devotion to principle to do what Michael has done than it does merely to go along with the herd . Then , one day last fall , Michael and I were discussing the prospect of his working at the sanatorium in Booneville , and he said quite simply : " I 'm not going , Mother . " It was a horrid moment for me and I shall never forget it . His words seemed to hang in the air and , for a long time , we did n't speak or even look at each other . It was n't that I was shocked , for I 'd had ample warning . He 'd been leading up to this extreme position for several months . This was Michael , after all . He wanted his stand to be pure and uncompromising . He would not equivocate . He wanted to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no matter how prepared I was . frightening news was frightening . The point was , he had made up his  | mind . Not only was he refusing to go to war or be a conscientious objector , he was also going to renounce the entire Selective Service System . He was not going to accept any alternate service as an attendant at the Booneville sanatorium ; he was not going to cooperate with the draft law on any level whatsoever . He took his draft card and returned it to the board . He went to live at a huge old house in town that came to be called " Arkansas Peace House , " where he could share experiences with several young men like himself . Since he immediately became unemployable , he devoted himself completely to his cause and began draft counseling . " There are legal alternatives to simple submission , " he told other young men . " The draft boards are supposed to advise kids of them , but all they ever do is to push them into service . " The local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since Michael had been classified 1-0 ; it was now made up of five members , with a retired military man as legal adviser , and all of them objected to Michael 's counseling work . In December , his case came up . He was called by the draft board for a routine physical examination . He refused to go . In January , he was ordered to the Arkansas Tuberculosis Sanatorium in Booneville for alternate service , and again he refused to go . He spent his time speaking to student groups , advising young men on legal alternatives to the draft . What little money he had he made from baby-sitting , typing , cleaning up the Wesley Foundation office at Little Rock University . ( In time , as a result of all its activities , that interdenominational organization was disbanded by university authorities , for it had become the center for dissenting young people . ) Then , on March 5 , Michael was arrested at the Peace House and brought to the Pulacki County Jail in Little Rock . Needless to say , it came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and me , Immediately , we went to cash in all our bonds to raise bail money , but Michael refused to sign the release . He wanted no quarter . He was going the whole way with his convictions . It was terribly upsetting , for the conditions in that prison were horrible . It was dark and musty and terribly depressing . We had to talk to him through an iron door with some grillwork , and we could barely see his face . We were allowed to visit him only twice a week , on Tuesday and Saturday , and on that first visiting day , he had over thirty visitors . He looked pale and sickly and frightened . He had not eaten for several days , and when he saw us , he broke into tears . He apologized for putting us through all this , especially me , but I told him he should feel no guilt . " It 's not me , Michael , it 's what you are going through that 's sad . These are your convictions , so be true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing you are doing what you believe in . " I thought later that my strength was far greater than it might have been be- cause I had eleven others to love and worry about , too . If Michael had been my only child , I suppose I might have responded differently . Then , on April 1 , the day after President Johnson finally announced that talks , hopefully leading to peace , were to begin , Michael was tried and found guilty . It was the day I stopped all resistance to his rebellious position . Michael may be wrong , but I am as proud of him as any mother might be of a son who came home with the Silver Star for gallantry in combat . I will stand by him always . I say this with a strong and positive emotion , for I know of some parents whose sons are doing what Michael has done and they refuse to listen . They denounce their children , ashamed of what they represent . One boy I know , in jail , gets horrible letters from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am sorry for boys with parents like that . It is a credit to all of us that our family has continued to stay together . In fact , because of Michael , we are now more closely knit than ever , though no one fully agrees with his position . Like myself , his father has come a long way toward understanding him , and , as a result , is thinking more about the way this country is moving . The other children , especially those who are old enough to appreciate it , have seen how beautiful and brave their brother really is , and I think they will always be inspired by that . As a mother , I know there is just so much you can do for your children . I have done all I could to help mine grow up with vigorous minds and bodies , hoping that they would become the kind of adults I wanted them to be . But that is not to be . Michael , for one , is his own man . He goes his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do and it is up to me to understand him and love him . Above all else , that is what I have learned . Yes , I 've suffered for him and will continue to do so . But I have too many things to do to let it overwhelm me . For one thing , I look forward to another operation that the doctors say will make me well again , and then I can grow strong and become active . Michael will be all right , I know that , for all the anguish of his restricted , unproductive , mail-censored life in prison . ( " I know I shift from depression to joy , " he writes . " But I am lucky . There are many outside who are imprisoned , not by bars , but by their own values . .. When in such a state of mind , who can even begin to love others ? " ) He reads a lot and likes to play bridge with his mates . He works as a clerk in the prison office . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so , but then I wonder if he will accept it . Meanwhile , life goes on , as they say . Sometimes we watch the ten o'clock news at night on television , and there is a little printed line that crawls along the bottom of the screen : " Do you know where your children are ? " Yes , I know . I always know . I hope and pray it will never be otherwise with me.
