Many Americans suspect that they are descended from European royalty and often hire genealogists to prove it . By the same token , many Europeans are convinced that they have a relative who emigrated to America and became a millionaire . A few are right . The rest provide employment for lawyers , archivists and private detectives-especially in France , where the search for several legacies has gone on for generations . None of them is more fabulous than that of Jean-Pierre Mallet , who , so the story goes , died childless in 1818 in Winooski , Vt. , leaving behind properties that stretched from the shores of Lake Champlain all the way to Chicago . <P> To be sure , no Vermont probate court records any evidence of Mallet 's millions-or indeed of his ever having lived in Vermont. * The U.S. Treasury also claims that it knows nothing of this vast estate , now worth $512 million , which it is supposed to be holding in trust for the rightful heirs . Such professions of ignorance do not deceive Princess Hlne Favraud Ayoubi , 45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the World Union of Mallet Heirs , which is dedicated to recovering the legacy . Nor was she overly fazed last week when the French government indicted her for swindling 22,000 members of the Mallet union out of $66,000 in dues through " chimerical promises of eventual gain . " <P> In her eyes , it is all part of a gigantic Franco-American plot . As the blonde , plump princess has been telling her 22,000 relatives ever since she set up the union in 1957 , their common ancestor was one of 13 children of a poor Limousin farmer who fought with the Marquis de Lafayette in the American Revolution and was rewarded by a grateful Continental Congress with a huge farm in Vermont . He multiplied his fortune by 1 ) discovering oil in Vermont , 2 ) marrying a Creole beauty whose Louisiana father left them his gold mines , and 3 ) buying Chicago slaughterhouses . After his death , his property was expropriated by President Andrew Jackson as compensation for Napoleon 's blockade of the U.S. during the War of 1812 , and ever since both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole thing up . <P> Wild as the story may seem , it has survived the earnest attempts of a century of debunking historians , for the Princess Ayoubi is hardly the first to tell it . It has been told and retold in Limousin , where Mallet is as common a surname as is Johnson in Minnesota , since the middle of the 19th century . U.S. Consul Walter Griffin did in fact try to locate the inheritance , called it quits in 1894-and for his pains earned the disapproval of the French National Assembly , which demanded a more thorough investigation . Government opinion , however , seems to have quietly come round to Griffin 's conclusions , for a Mallet union founded in Rochefort in 1926 was disbanded shortly afterward-on police orders .
