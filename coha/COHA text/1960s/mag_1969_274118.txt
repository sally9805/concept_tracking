IN an extraordinary historical reversal , British soldiers last week were deployed for the purpose of keeping Irishmen from each other 's throats . Some 6,500 strong , they were assigned their pacific role in Northern Ireland , whose two largest cities , Belfast and Londonderry , were still smoking after four nights of sectarian rioting between Protestants and Catholics . <P> In the latest manifestation of a bitter heritage of hatred that dates back nearly three centuries , eight Ulstermen lay dead and nearly 800 ( including 226 policemen ) were injured . Side streets along Falls Road , the principal thoroughfare in Belfast 's Catholic section , were blocked by barricades of double-decker buses . British troops strung concertina wire down Crumlin Road , Belfast 's religious Mason-Dixon line . To one side fluttered the Union Jack of the loyalist Protestants , and to the other , the tricolor of the Irish Republic had been briefly flown .

General Sir Ian Freeland , 57 , the much-decorated British commander in Northern Ireland . Chichester-CIark consented to what amounts to the disarming of the B Specials , who used to keep their weapons at home but henceforth will be required to place them under central control . <P> Additionally , an investigation into the composition of the regular and B Special police would be headed by Lord John Hunt , leader of the mountain-climbing team that first scaled Mt . Everest . Other British aides will set up shop in the office of the Ulster Minister of Home Affairs and in Chichester-Clark 's own office .
