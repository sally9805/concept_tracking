That 's the Ticket <P> Sir : After listening to the acceptance speeches of Nixon and Agnew Aug. 16 , I can only comment : thank God-we have two candidates who are speaking for the forgotten middle class . May they find the strength and courage to carry out the power of their convictions and , once again , make America a proud nation . <P> MARY JO LAKE Norristown , Pa . <P> <P> Sir : Three months ago , you stated that Maryland 's Governor Spiro Agnew , after his defection from Governor Rockefeller , was receiving hints from Mr. Nixon as a possible vice-presidential running mate May 24 . At the time , it seemed very unlikely to me , but now Governor Agnew turns out to be the number two man on the ticket . Thank you for this insight and good luck on the Demo Veep . <P> MIKE HOMER Portland , Ore . <P> <P> Sir : What a night-watching the Republican Convention elect our next President , Hubert Humphrey . <P> VIRGINIA H. BERK Seattle <P> Sir : It 's official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Politics . <P> RICHARD A. CUMMINS Indianapolis <P> Sir : It occurs to me that Richard Nixon 's choice of running mate could only mean better slogans for the fall campaign . " A Gnew Nixon , " or something like that . <P> <P> P. M. null <P> Hamilton , N.Y . <P> <P> Sir : Here we are , come November , with a Humphrey-Nixon choice , a psychologist 's avoidance-avoidance situation . We are the victims of a stagnant two-party system loaded with loyal party hacks transferring favors among themselves with no interest in the people 's wishes or best interest . What we need is a little competition , like a fourth party called the Independents , with a ticket like Rockefeller-McCarthy , with a platform of guaranteed jobs , normalcy of foreign politics , a direct primary , a world-federalism outlook and , most of all , a general , honest , political orientation toward the best for all the people . Maybe if enough people felt the same way , we could get organized . <P> THEODORE W. JOHNSON Williamstown , Mass . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour of need , and now the party stands by Nixon . It 's so simple . I do n't understand why I 'm so depressed . <P> DARENE H. LENNON Evanston , Ill . <P> <P> Sir : I am only ten years old but my mommy let me stay up to watch the convention . She said I would learn a lot . I only went to sleep once . My daddy went to sleep three times . <P> The part I liked best was when the balloons went down . I also liked the part when the clowns marched around and around . I like Chet and David , but they did not get to march around . They just have to stay in their seats . I guess they ca n't even go to the bathroom . I am glad Mr. Nixon won , because my daddy says Nixon never wins so I think it was his turn . <P> BOBBY SIMONS East Orleans , Mass . <P> <P> Not First but Best <P> Sir : Eugene McCarthy , if elected , will not be the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But by most readers ' standards , he will be the best . Abraham Lincoln wrote a number of poems , much in the vein of this one , about an acquaintance " who at the age of 19 unaccountably became furiously mad " : <P> And here 's an object more of dread , Than aught the grave contains-A human-form , with reason fled , While wretched life remains .
