The main types and how they differ . . . what you can expect them to accomplish . . . the kinds of people they can not help . . . and how to tell whether they are worth what they cost . FOR some people , especially in the advertising and entertainment worlds , the solution to almost any problem is to consult a psychiatrist . Other groups in our society will tolerate extreme eccentricity or misbehavior , for nothing could be worse than going to a psychiatrist . Somewhere in between is the majority ? vaguely familiar with the jargon of psychiatry which everyone uses these days , yet comfortable in the belief that mental illness always happens to somebody else . But what if this thing suddenly strikes close to home ? Perhaps your wife becomes obsessed with the idea that she may hurt or kill her children . What if you decide that you desperately need psychotherapy yourself ? What do you do Olen ? How do you choose a psychiatrist ? All too often , in practice , the question does not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxury available only to those with enough money and social status to demand the best and get it . The poor man in an out-patient clinic has no choice . Nor has the psychotic who is committed to a state hospital . In some parts of the country the shortage of psychiatrists is so acute that there is no choice for anyone . But even those who live where psychiatrists abound and who can afford to choose seldom know how to go about it . They pick their way haphazardly , filled with misinformation and fear , sometimes wasting years before finding real help . For example , a bright , well-behaved fourteenyear-old boy suddenly began to disrupt his classes , insult his teachers , and fail every course . Alarmed , his mother went to see the school authorities , who suggested consulting the family doctor . He , in turn , recommended a psychologist . The latter listened to the story , then explained that he did not treat children , and recommended a second psychologist . This turned ant to he a woman , whom the boy vehemently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , screaming that he hated his parents and threatening to kill them . His mother went back to the school , and was again referred to the family doctor , who this time sent the boy to a state mental hospital . Since this institution was about to close its out-patient clinic , the child was directed to a private general hospital . Here , it turned out , the waiting list was too long , so the boy was sent on to a city hospital . At this point the frantic mother telephoned the local branch of the National Association for Mental Health . There , months after her first visit to the school , she learned of an excellent private clinic for children right in her own neighborhood . She took him there and treatment was started immediately . Elsewhere , a promising young chemist , after being struck down by a car , found that he could no longer concentrate on his work . Physically he was in fine shape , according to many doctors , including a neurosurgeon , who examined him during his dealings with insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had always had a quick temper ; now the slightest annoyance enraged him , giving him a violent headache . Realizing that something was seriously wrong , he decided to seek psychiatric treatment . Lawyers ' and doctors ' fees had eaten up most of the insurance settlement , so he applied to a local psychiatric clinic . There a social worker interviewed him and gave him an appointment with the staff psychiatrist three weeks later . He saw the psychiatrist and repeated his story , but decided in the process that this psychiatrist was too cold and unfriendly . So he failed to return for his next appointment . His symptoms got worse . Not knowing where to turn , he went to see one of his former chemistry professors who happened to know a psychiatrist . This doctor talked with the young man , but concluded that he could not take him as a patient , and referred him to a psychoanalytic clinic . There he went through another interview . Finally he was told that he would indeed he acceptable for treatment at low cost , hut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . PSYCHIATRIC MATCHMAKING T H IS kind of run-around is tragically familiar to people in search of psychiatric treatment . Typically , neither patient knew what services were available in the community , and both found the particular therapist available to them personally unsuitable . Additional confusion is often caused by the variety of names and labels in this field and by the many different schools of psychiatry , each of which is all too ready to knock its rivals . Should you take this most precious of possessions ? your mind ? to a Freudian , a Jungian , a follower of Karen Homey , Carl Rogers , or Harry Stack Sullivan ? To the doctor who gave your neighbor tranquilizers , to the lay therapist your best friend swears by , to the clinic in the nearest hospital ? To a neurologist , a psychologist , an analytically-oriented psychiatrist , or a famous , expensive psychoanalyst ? How do you know the man is really good , anyhow ? The answer is , do n't try to guess . Go to an expert and let him make an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least check your candidates against some solid criteria . No profession makes it easy to evaluate its services . It is hard likewise for the consumer to discover the real quality of much more tangible products . So before choosing a car , one generally shops around from dealer to dealer . But the decision to try psychiatric treatment is often a desperate measure , after many other things have been tried , and there is seldom much shopping around , except for prices . That is why it is particularly important , in this field , to start out by finding someone who knows the community 's resources and can act , in a sense , as a psychiatric matchmaker . Ideally this matchmaker would be a well-trained , broadly experienced psychiatrist connected with a first-class hospital or medical school . To find such a person , you might inquire of the chief of psychiatric or medical services in the best local hospital , or the director of the psychiatry department in the nearest medical school , or your own family physician . The leading psychiatrist in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step . Although an outstanding psychiatrist may not have time to take on new patients on a regular basis ( and his rates might make him prohibitive ) , he may have a large consultant practice . In one or two interviews he can find out what the prospective patient is like , what he really needs , and who can help him . Then he can arrange a first appointment with the most likely therapist . He might also advise about a very important question : whether and where the patient needs to be hospitalized . If no psychiatrist is available for this kind of consultation there are other resources . In New Haven , Connecticut , for instance , many psychiatric referrals of the general population are made in the hospital 's emergency-room , for urgent cases , and in the " open clinic , " an out-patient service where anybody can see a psychiatrist without making an appointment . Unfortunately , such clinics are still very rare . The various mental-health associations until recently paid very little attention to this problem . They are now beginning to establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local psychiatric facilities and qualified psychiatrists , as well as lay therapists , psychiatric social workers , and counselors of other kinds , such as clergymen trained in pastoral psychology . The Manhattan Society for Mental Health em-ploys a full-time psychiatric social worker to do specific referrals . In some cases ? especially when people arc not too sure they want psychiatric help , or when they can not afford a private consultation ? the easiest first step may be to visit the local family service agency , whose case worker will try to determine what is needed and , if the agency 's own counseling service seems insufficient , may suggest a good psychiatric clinic . In other cases the family physician or the local minister , if they are well informed , can make adequate referrals . Any one of these sources would , at least , be a guarantee against quacks , such as the shoe salesman in Long Beach , California , who practiced " psychotherapy " on the side , at $25 a session , or the " psychologist " who , under the guise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IS HE ? 0 N CE equipped with the names of two or three likely psychiatrists , you can begin to look for certain vital qualities . Easiest to check is good training . Your family doctor can help you evaluate the psychiatrist 's medical school , the hospital where he served his residency , and the specialty boards he has passed , if any , as well as his present standing in research , teaching , and hospital work and his membership in professional societies . Most of these qualifications are listed in the general medical directories , which physicians usually have , and in the directories of the American Psychiatric Association , to which nearly all psychiatrists belong . Such basic checking may reveal , for instance , whether a psychiatrist 's experience has been limited to state hospitals ? not a good recommendation if you are neurotic and need psychotherapy , but adequate in severe psychoses . Next , you want to find out about the psychiatrist 's personal ability . And here comes the rub . A surgeon 's skill may be rated objectively : word soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there is no comparable record of successes or failures in psychiatry . No matter how impressive a psychiatrist 's credentials and learned publications , he may still be an ineffective therapist . If you have pneumonia youcan get reasonably good treatment from a doctor even if he is personally a heel . But you can not separate psychotherapy from the therapist . A lot depends on his personality . ' Who , then , is in a position to judge ? Who can say whether Dr. Smith , a psychoanalyst , is truly effective or not ? Certainly not his current patients , who may be in the throes of positive or negative transference , and attribute to him near-magical healing powers or the faults of an ogre . Even his ex-patients have a vested interest in believing that their treatment has been completely successful . In fact , nobody knows for sure . It is a good sign , however , if you have heard he has helped other people . And if you are lucky enough to have found a good consultant at the outset , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen patients who , after months or years of treatment , have felt the need to change therapists ? and know why . He may be aware of certain psychiatrists ' special fields of interest . Even more important , he may know quite a bit about them as human beings . In general your psychiatrist should be a person who can manage his own affairs realistically rather than , for instance , one who has had a series of messy divorces , or has petty quarrels with everyone he deals with . However , just as a swimming coach need not have made world records himself ( it is enough that he bring out the best in others ) , you can not expect psychiatrists to be perfect or to lead model lives . This is the kind of erroneous belief which small children have about their parents . It has no place in the adult world and is particularly inappropriate here . Sometimes a man is first drawn to the study of psychiatry because he has suffered from many of the neurotic symptoms he is planning to cure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States in any one year , about one-fifth are future psychiatrists , psychologists , or psychiatric social workers . Some of them undertook analysis as treatment , then Dr. Fredrick Redlich is professor of psychiatry and chairman of the department at Yale University 's School of Medicine . His influential book , " Social Class and Mental Illness " ? written with the sociologist August Hollingshead and based on a ten-year study in New Haven ? shows how income . education , and status affect the kind of treatment given to the mentally ill . Dr. Redlich 's collaborator on this article i , . Maya Pines , a stuff reporter on " Life " and author of the hook , " Retarded Children , Can Be Helped . " 36 HOW TO CHOOSE A PSYCHIATRIST became so interested that they decided to specialize in it or a related field . Others went into a " training analysis " to help them in their professional work , but discovered that they had a personal need for it . Presumably this analysis , which is longer and more thorough than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its symptoms . THE MALADJUSTED DOCTOR T H E question remains : Can a maladjusted psychiatrist give good treatment ? This must he answered empirically . Some very successful psychiatrists are maladjusted ; however , they can help only in those areas where they have improved to some degree themselves . A homosexual psychiatrist , for instance ? and there are some ? could be effective in most areas but could not treat homosexuals ( unless the treatment consisted only in helping the patient adjust to his condition ) . One well-established psychoanalyst who suffers from recurrent deep depressions refuses to treat psychotics or suicidal cases : he knows that their periods of severe anxiety would upset him too much . He has had real success in helping persons who are not too sick to become more sensitive to their feelings and lead richer lives . Sometimes the fact that a psychiatrist has worked through a similar problem makes him particularly suited to a patient . Thus a man who has conquered serious difficulties in his own marriage may be very helpful in marital problems , and a woman psychiatrist who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career women 's maladjustments . Evaluating such factors in a psychiatrist 's personal life ? difficult enough for a skilled consultant ? is not made easier for a patient by the rule which forbids social contact with his therapist . Yet this is a necessary precaution , preventing all kinds of entanglements . The more remote a psychiatrist is from a patient 's job . friends , and relatives , the better . Psychiatrists usually deal with only one member of a family ? a fact often misunderstood by parents , who bring in an adolescent for treatment and then expect the psychiatrist to discuss all the youngster 's problems with them . The psychiatrist must have the patient 's confidence , and the youngster must feel the doctor is entirely on his side , no matter who pays the bill . If the parents want help for themselves , they must get it either from another psychiatrist or from a psychiatric social worker . One essential trait in a psychiatrist which is relatively easy to recognize is sensitivity . Thepatient should feel that his psychiatrist is exceptionally sensitive to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see and understand more than the patient . An intensive relationship like psychotherapy , in which two persons must trust and understand each other , is more likely to succeed when they have similar value systems . There is nothing wrong with being operated on by a Japanese plastic surgeon or being treated by a Russian liver specialist , although people often prefer doctors of their own backgrounds even for organic diseases . But sharing ? or at least thoroughly understanding ? the patient 's culture becomes essential when the illness is in the mind . The average American psychiatrist would hardly know what a Buddhist , for instance , really meant by his free associations , being unfamiliar with the context . Similarly most psychiatrists in this country who belong to the upper social strata are not well equipped to treat lower-class patients effectively . Their lack of understanding , reinforced by the less-educated patient 's abysmal ignorance of what the psychiatrist is trying to do , has served even more than the cost factor to limit good psychiatric treatment to the well-educated and the rich . How this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiftyfive-year-old woman who recently came to a psychiatric clinic in Connecticut . She was unattractive , poorly dressed , and gave the impression of being stupid . She was in great misery . Here are excerpts of her long whining stream of corn-plaints : I do n't know what 's the matter with me . My teeth drive me crazy . My stomach hurts . I have wicked nerves .... I do n't like to have anything to do with food ? eat it , cook it , look at it or anything . . . . Things keep getting worse all the time . My girdle feels like it 's tightening up on me as she spoku she snapped her girdle against her thigh , my stockings bother me , it hurts down here .... My clothes bother me , my teeth bother me . . . . I do n't want to go out in the street .... I have n't felt good since I had my teeth out . I just paid 5300 for a new set . I take ' em out and put ' em in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can think of is my teeth bothering me . I just ca n't stand it . . . . I have a pain in my right side . There 's something wrong with my breathing . My jaw hurts . My back bothers me every time I eat I 'd like to be worth something , I do n't seem to be . . . My girdle bothers me snap . My nerves hurt all over my body . . . . My girdle feels tight here , it 's pulling on me snap . BY F. C. The psychiatrist obviously did n't like this patient and hedged about taking her into therapy . He doubted that she would make a " good patient . " He concluded the interview by saving : " Well , I 'll tell you , Mrs. S. , I want to confer with a couple of the people on the staff , and then I 'll let you know when you can come and if you can come . We 'll leave it that way , then . I 'll talk with them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nice talking to you . " Two weeks later , the clinic sent her a letter notifying her of an appointment . While the letter was in the mail , however , the woman committed suicide . THE MAIN TYPES AND HOW THEY DIFFER P E O P L E who go to a psychiatrist often do so as a last resort . He must be able to evaluate suicidal or other dangerous tendencies . for an error on his part may amount to a death sentence . The men and women who carry this awesome responsibility are all medical doctors . To be certified by the Specialty Board in Psychiatry , they must have had additional training as residents in psychiatric training centers . Beyond this , however , they fall into two distinct categories : those whose orientation is primarily analytic and psychological , who may be called the A-P group ; and those who use the directive-organic approach ? the D-0 group . The A-P group have had full or partial psychoanalytic training and are somewhat removed from the main stream of medicine . They very rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients to other doctors for them . Their technique is designed to help patients gain insight into their own unconscious forces . They see their patients for a " fifty-minute hour " up to three , four . or even five times a week . The atmosphere in their offices is like a private library with comfortable chairs and a couch inviting good talk . The group with the D-0 approach , on the other hand , work in unmistakably medical offices . They wear white coats , make medical and neurological examinations , prescribe drugs , and may administer shock or other organic treatments . Through advice or admonition they actively try to change their patients ' attitudes and behavior . They see their patients far less frequently and since their sessions are only fifteen to thirty minutes long , they charge muds less ; but with a greater turnover they often earn more than their A-P colleagues . At the top of the A-P ladder stand the classical Freudian analysts , who belong to the American Psychoanalytic Association . Usually they look down on colleagues influenced by Clara Thompson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Carl Jung , or Alfred Adler . As between the Protestant sects , there are sharp theoretical differences between these schools . Some of their methods and theories must be taken on faith , and each believes it has the right path to salvation . However , the actual process of therapy , as practiced by the best in all schools , has far more similarities than differences . The real feuds ? no less bitter for the fact that they are generally hushed up ? are those between the A-P and D-0 groups . The A-P psychiatrists privately believe that the D-0 practitioners arc ignorant and lowbrow , and call those who rely excessively on organic methods " shock artists . " The D-0 psychiatrists on the other hand think of the A-Ps as unmedica doctrinaires , and sometimes even quacks . They belong to separate organizations . read different journals , and seem to live in different worlds . Fortunately there is a trend in America today toward the development of a middle group . Meanwhile , however , do not expect a D-0 practitioner to recommend psychoanalysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man can truly favor only those techniques which he knows best . This is why , if one wants to consider various possibilities , one should start out with a consultant who has the broadest possible orientation , even though he may be close to one of the two camps . WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT TO ACCOMPLISH R EGARDLESS of school , there are some qualities which all good psychiatrists share : they are Friendly , patient enough for the long pull , understanding , well-trained , well-informed , and have total integrity . The patient will react to these qualities by saying three things after a good initial interview : ( I ) " I felt comfortable with him. - ( 2 ) " I think he understands in some way what my problem is. " ( 3 ) " I think I know now what the next step is ? or at least I know we 'll work something out . " The patient does n't need to like the psychiatrist particularly , on first acquaintance ; but he should not stay with someone whom he intensively dislikes or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the free flow of communication necessary to good therapy and the patient should try somebody else . At the same time , the psychiatrist should be able , before accepting a patient , to say : ( 1 ) " I 'm really interested in his problem . " ( 2 ) " I feel 1 can do something for him . " ( 3 ) " There is something in him , some particular human quality , which 1 like despite all his faults . " Many patients are not too likable , for obvious reasons . They usually do n't like other people ; they may he extremely demanding , aggressive , passive , or infantile . The psychiatrist can not be expected to like them without reservations , but he must be able to recognize and value their human potential . It is , of course , a seller 's market . Psychiatrists with a good reputation can usually pick and choose among prospective patients , far more discriminatingly than patients can choose among psychiatrists . Their tendency is to select only those problems they know they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile the less successful psychiatrist , who can not afford to choose , may end up with cases for which he is not too well suited and which drag on indefinitely . If both psychiatrist and patient decide to go ahead , they embark on a long , strenuous journey whose outcome is always uncertain . ln our contemporary culture , many people have an inordinate faith in psychotherapy . While healthier than the last generation 's nihilism , this overoptimism can be harmful . To avoid disappointment , prospective patients and their families should understand what they may reasonably expect from treatment . In severe mental illness , or psychosis , expectations tend to be fairly realistic . Such illness is usually recognized by others , and the patient must submit to treatment . If the psychiatrist can relieve his symptoms , bringing him back to a reasonably normal state , he has attained his goal . Most psychotics are still treated in large state hospitals , which remain shockingly overcrowded and understaffed . But wherever possible the trend is toward treating psychotics in the community ? either in general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices . The accent is On rehabilitation , and although psychiatrists still do n't understand what causes some patients to recover while others do not , they have gone a long way with the help of individual and group psychotherapy , the tranquilizing drugs and other treatments . With neurotics , however , both patient and psychiatrist want to do far more than relieve symptoms . The aim is self-realization of the individual . A lot of the misery which is now called neurosis would have been ignored twenty-five years ago , for people did n't know anything could be done about it ( they still can not be absolutely sure ) . Today , if a man suffers from severe anxiety or depressions over unrealistic issues , or consistently hurts himself and those around him , or is troubled by psychosomatic illnesses , he is expected to seek psychotherapy . Unfortunately this treatment can not promise anything definite . If a patient comes with a whole complex of problems ? he ca n't hold a job , his marriage is a mess , his children hate him and he hates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of treatment will be or how long it will take . He can not promise , as a dentist might , that lie will fix the infected tooth , describing what it will look like when he is through : a big gap in his mouth , or a shiny new tooth . All he can say is , " I 've seen problems like yours that have been helped by this technique . " ANALYSIS OR SHORT-TERM THERAPY ? A G 0 0 D guide to psychoanalytic technique is Dr. Lawrence S. Ruble 's book , Practical ? and Theoretical Aspects of Psychoanalysis. * It is valuable both for the patient and his family , who will have to put up with a strange way of life . Psychoanalysis ( essentially a method of bringing to awareness unconscious conflicts which underlie neurotic symptoms and character traits ) is not , however , the only technique used to treat neurotics . There are also various short-term psycho-therapies . Analytic psychotherapy as developed *International Universities Press , New York , 1951. by Franz Alexander , fur example , uses analytic principles but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the personality . Client-centered therapy as explained by Carl Rogers involves proper responses of the therapist to the patient 's or client 's feelings with subsequent changes in his self-esteem . Two techniques independently developed by Helmut Kaiser and rules Coleman also stress proper communication and emphasize the therapist-patient relationship . Techniques of emotional re-education as used by William Terhune rely on guidance of the emotionally immature patient by a mature and experienced psychiatrist . Terhune 's methods are characteristic for a directive approach in psycho-therapy . Psychoanalysis is the deeper and more scientific exploration and has enormous significance because of what it reveals about the human mind . But the public tends to overrate it as therapy . Because it 's so long and costly , people believe it 's that much better ; it has greater snob value than short-term therapy . Patients in deep analysis sometimes think those who get therapy only a couple of times a week do so because they can not afford full analysis or because they could n't find an analyst or because the analyst thought they were not good enough . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real question which will only be answered by research . Classical Freudian analysis may be necessary in certain profound character disturbances which shorter therapy might not reach at all . But there is no evidence that it is superior in the majority ? l-eases ; in fact scientific comparisons of the results of different techniques have not yet been made . The couch has somehow become involved in the psychiatric class system . Freudian analysts nearly always use this piece of furniture , so beloved of cartoonists . Some patients now regard it as a symbol ? as proof that they arc getting the best . Yet there can be full analysis without a couch . Erik Erikson , for instance , never uses one with adolescents , who , he feels , want to face the analyst and need the more direct contact . Patients in short-term therapy may or may not lie on a couch ; if not , they sit in a chair facing the therapist , or away front him . Freud started the couch system simply because he did not want to he stared at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be distracted by the sight of hint . Lying on a couch in the position of an infant a sick person also helps some people in free association and reveries revealing unconscious processes . One psychoanalyst , Dr. Douglas Bond , teases his young residents for believing in the " ball and valve theory " ? the notion that when a patient reclines , : I ball in his head rolls clown , a valve opens , anti the unconscious pops out . The unconscious has been found to be far more reticent . Perhaps the most pathetically false expectation of all , as Dr. Allen Wheelis pointed out in The Quest for Identity , * is that psychiatry can solve the problem of values and give meaning to people 's lives ( some existential psychiatrists actually attempt to do this ) . Too many people hope that analysis will show them what is really worth struggling for , but that is not the function of psychotherapy . In dealing with neurosis , the psychiatrist is concerned with unconscious conflicts which cause deep suffering , disturbed relationships , a limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the treatment is successful he will relieve this suffering , bring the patient an increased awareness of himself , ; ind give him a somewhat greater freedom of decision . However he can not provide an ideology nor answer to the confusions of our age . Psychoanalysis and analytic therapy are open-ended treatments ? Freud spoke of the interminable analysis . Analysis does not stop after certain areas have been covered , but whenever the patient has learned the technique well enough to use it alone . Before anyone undertakes such prolonged therapy , there should be a trial period , clearly understood on both sides . After a few weeks , or perhaps months , the patient and psychiatrist can decide whether they want to continue . If you , for instance , should decide to go on , how can you know whether you are getting good treatment ? One index is the feeling that you are learning something . Therapy should he an emotionally gripping and interesting experience . If for a long period of time you do n't know what is going on or what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have bogged down interminably , the patient should ask for an evaluation by another psychiatrist . WHAT IS IT WORTH I N ANY decision about psychiatric treatment , of course , the question of money is inescapable ? somebody has to pay for it . Patients are entitled to , and should demand , a clear answer . A rough estimate of the costs is essential for sound planning . If , for example , a private hospital charges $25 a clay ' ( not a very high fee for such hospitals ) the treatment should be *W. %V . Norton , New York , 1958. 40 HOW TO CHOOSE A PSYCHIATRIST budgeted so that the patient does not have to transfer to a public hospital when he has used up all his money . Nor should he leave the hospital cured but penniless . One method might be to try the private hospital for a limited time , so as not to use up his funds completely . Outside of hospitals , patients who can not afford a private psychiatrist 's full fees may sometimes arrange for a slight reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to a clinic , however , must face the fact that his therapist may still he in training . Since he is being closely supervised by a senior therapist , the chances of getting adequate care are fairly high , especially if the clinic is connected with a good teaching hospital or training center . Often a beginner 's enthusiasm and interest may even outweigh his lack of experience . A surprising amount of good may be done by a therapist who has a warm feeling for his patients and sticks it out , even if his professional colleagues do not think his technique is the best . A much more serious problem is the fact that most clinics have long waiting lists . Psychoanalysts charge an average of $15 to $35 per visit . For full analysis with as many as five sessions a week , the cost may average $3,000 to $4,000 a year . From the psychoanalyst 's point of view , the hourly income is no bigger ? and sometimes less ? than that of other medical specialists who have gone through equally long , arduous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other specialists treat many more patients ? a dermatologist , for instance , may see five patients an hour at $10 each . Sometimes one hears another interpretation : that paying high fees is in the patient 's interest , for if he does n't make a sacrifice he wo n't really want to get well . Actually , while effort by the patient is necessary , it does not have to be a financial effort which cripples him and his family for years to come . Treatment may be worth a sacrifice in money and time : whether it is worth sacrificing everything , however , must be evaluated realistically . Some therapies are truly life-saving . Some are extremely important to a patient in the future conduct of his life . Others may be more in the nature of a cosmetic operation , which one may take or leave . A very few are harmful . The general bulk of psychotherapy helps people to some extent . Eventually ? after more research by the experts ? the public itself will have to answer the question , " What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if it is performed by a psychiatrist . He is a physician who has specialized in mental illness and may or may not have been trained psychoanalytically . However , a growing number of psychologists are being trained to give psychotherapy . In a more disguised form many psychiatric social workers also carry on psychotherapy , even if they call some of it case work . The non-medical or lay therapists are frequently Ph.D . ' s , thus acquiring the title of " doctor . " Some of the most famous analysts , like Margaret Brenman , Robert Wirelder , and Theodor Rcik , are Tay analysts , although since 1946 the American Psychoanalytic Association has virtually closed its ranks and refused to admit non-M.D. ' s . A physician is , to be sure , needed to treat most psychotics or persons with psychosomatic symptoms . Only he can prescribe tranquilizing drugs , and recognize an organic disease . In other cases , however , the medical degree has limited meaning . Many Tay therapists send their patients to physicians for preliminary checkups anyway , and many A-P @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nevertheless , a number of psychiatric consultants still recommend psychiatrists at all times . One reason for this preference is that the training of fay therapists has not been satisfactorily organized . Some training institutes , especially in university centers , are first-rate ; others are diploma mills . Only a handful of states have laws governing who may he called a " psychologist , " and in large parts of the country anybody could set himself up as a " therapist " or " analyst " without even having gone through high school . As long as this situation persists , the medical profession will continue to claim that only M.D. 's are qualified to do psychotherapy . A NEW PROFESSION ? T . E shortage of therapists of all kinds is so desperate , however ? and treatment by a psychiatrist so far beyond reach of most Americans ? that sooner or later something must give . At present there are only 10,600 psychiatrists in the United States , most of them in the big cities . The New York ? New jersey metropolitan area alone has one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Washington , Philadelphia , Boston , and San Francisco . Despite the great impact of psychiatry on modern life , and the 21 per cent increase in psychiatrists in the past three years , less than half as many doctors specialize in psychiatry today as in surgery or internal medicine . The plain fact is that there will never be enough young people who can afford to become psychiatrists ? and even fewer who can become psychoanalysts ( analytic training alone costs about $20,000 ) . The shortage is most evident in state hospitals , where psychiatric positions remain permanently vacant . But the dearth of iherapists is also a bitter fact of life for thousands of low- or middle-income patients who must either wait an unbearably long time for treatment or never get any at all , One partial solution may be a wider use of group therapy , though this is not every patient 's meat . A broader approach would be the development of a new profession ? of psychotherapists who can be trained effectively but much more rapidly , in greater numbers and at lesser cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illness , * and recommended by Dr. Lawrence Kubie . At the National Institute of Mental Health , Dr. Margaret Rioch is now conducting experiments to determine the best methods of training such a profession . Eventually By August B. EMIHogshead and Fredrick C. Redlich , published by John Wiley , New York , 1958. it should be recognized by the states , which would set minimum requirements and certify or license all qualified psychotherapists . Meanwhile the U. S. Public Health Service through its National Institute of Mental Health and some state governments are spending large amounts of money to develop and improve research and training facilities and services . A number of psychiatrists and a handful of leaders in business and industry are groping for new methods of dealing with the nation 's largest unmet health need . One hopeful sign is the development of a new unit at New York 's Mount Sinai Hospital to provide free psychiatric consultations to corporate employees if the company pays an annual fee for the service . Free psychiatric consultations are available , too , to the half-million subscribers of the Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's thirty-two medical groups has one psychiatrist , and the group 's social workers help to arrange for whatever psychiatric treatment he may recommend . There are also the cash indemnity programs of the " major medical " insurance policies . Originally these reimbursed subscribers for 80 per cent of their psychiatric costs , along with other medical costs . Recently , however , many of them have been forced to cut their refunds to 50 per cent , and some are finding even this too high in the case of a long analysis . Looking for a way out , last July , Group Health Insurance in New York launched a two-year experiment to see whether short-term therapy is the answer and whether it can be made available to subscribers at a low premium . Under the project , fns ' which the U. S. Public Health Service has put up $300,000 , patients are allowed up to fifteen sessions of individual psychotherapy from any one of 1,100 psychiatrists in the area . In addition , both Group Health Insurance and Blue Shield are now offering to pay for thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whenever needed by any of their 1.4 million subscribers . Tf such plans were adopted on a large scale , they would partly solve the economic problem . But they could not begin to cope with the staggering shortage of therapists which would develop . Until the general public demands a far more intensive effort in this field , with a radical increase in research and in the training of qualified personnel , it will become increasingly difficult for people who need help to get it ? and even more difficult for them to choose a psychia-i trist who is well suited to them .
