CORNELIUS SHIELDS ON SAILING by Cornelius Shields . 240 pages . Prentice-Hall. $7.95 . <P> The wind is important ; so is the cut of the sails as well as the skill and care of the men who designed and built the boat . But to Corny Shields a racing sailboat-the only kind in which he is interested-is driven mainly by the skipper 's will to win . As just about the most successful racing skipper of this century ( TIME cover , July 27 , 1953 ) , Corny Shields has , inevitably , the most indomitable will to win . " Racing , " he admits frankly in this autobiography and sailor 's guidebook , " is the aspect of sailing that has gripped me the hardest . " Then he adds , perhaps intending to be disarming : " I 'm supposed to be a ' competitive ' person ; at least , I 've always enjoyed competitive sports and matching skills with others . " The fact is that Corny Shields , now a ripe 70 , would die if he did n't win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to win , Shields provides the formula . The aspirant must begin a year or so before he is born , by picking his parents right . They must raise the child with at least a summer home on river , lake or sea front . They need not be rich , though that helps . ( Shields picked a rich father . ) The aspiring skipper of America 's Cup yachts must begin sailing-and sailing to win-early in his grade school years . <P> By his high school years , the Shields protege will be spending every weekend day , every summer , racing around triangular courses in Penguins or Blue Jays or Lightnings . When he graduates to larger craft , he will need his weekdays off ( no summer work for him ) to perfect his skills in rigorous sail drills . He had better not go away to a prep school , because he should spend every winter weekend in frostbite racing , which may give him as many as eight starts a day-eight chances to show his will to win at the starting line , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , perhaps , the fledgling sailor may be considered qualified to crew for the likes of Corny Shields , in International One-Designs , or America 's Cup 12-meters , or in ocean-going yachts in the biennial Bermuda races . <P> Never Question . If it sounds like as tough an apprenticeship as that of midshipmen in Captain Bligh 's day , it is . Shields would not have it otherwise . He is dedicated to the idea that the important thing in sailing is racing , and the important thing in racing is winning . If any man is interested in sailing merely to enjoy the sensation of having his boat driven by the wind , Shields is not for him , and he is not for Shields . As a Johnny-come-lately to ocean racing ( in 1946 ) , Shields was appalled to find that on the 635-mile course from Newport to Bermuda , which takes four to six days , skippers allowed their crewmen to relax . Not Shields . He insisted on enforcing the same tense , split-second discipline that he knew from racing for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The wonder is that Captain Bligh Shields had no mutiny . But by then he had won , along with his international championships , the right to be the autocrat of the cockpit . Nobody who questions a Shields order is ever allowed on a Shields boat again .
