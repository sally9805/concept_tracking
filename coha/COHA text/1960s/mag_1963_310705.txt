Probably the most startling book to come out of Russia in recent years was Alexander Solzhenitsyn 's One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich . In massively compelling detail , it described the blighted existence of a prisoner in one of Stalin 's detention camps at a time when the Soviet government had barely got around to admitting their existence . But Solzhenitsyn had spent eight years in just such a camp . And a question arose-was it impressive merely because it was autobiographically true ? Now Solzhenitsyn 's second book-a pair of short novels-has appeared . Even in a translation that is stolidly wooden , " We Never Make Mistakes " ( University of South Carolina ) demonstrates that Solzhenitsyn is not only politically courageous but also a writer of stature by any standard . <P> This time Solzhenitsyn 's subjects are far less provocative - the life and death of an old peasant woman existing on the fringes of Soviet society ; an incident between two soldiers in wartime . But in each , not so much from easy political resentment as from a profound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ validity of the whole Soviet system . <P> Reverse Hero . The hero of the first story is a lonely , goodhearted , un worldly army officer who has been stuck in a job as a traffic-control boss at a rail junction behind the receding Rus sian front in the fall of 1941 . Lieut . Zotov exudes an innocent revolution ary zeal that clearly has no place in the cynical power structure of the Soviet world . In the ' 30s , when he volunteered to go to Spain , the authorities regarded him as some kind of nut and sent him back to the university . He is troubled because the war is not following the victorious blueprint that Joseph Stalin always said it would . His only solace is reading Das Kapital . " The worse the news from the war became , " writes Solzhenitsyn , " the more he buried himself in this thick blue book . " <P> Zotov is the precise reverse of the old cast-iron , pure-in-word-and-deed Soviet literary hero whom he outwardly resembles . His scruples about profiting from his command position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devotion to duty are presented not as Soviet virtues grafted on him by the state but as signs of an inner innocence that is doomed to disillusion . The moment comes when Zotov is confronted by a " straggler " - one of the thousands of Russian soldiers who had been separated from their outfits in the confusion as the Germans advanced . Zotov is drawn to the man . He talks to him about his own life in Moscow , about the straggler 's wife and children . Then , on the slightest possible evidence , he has to betray his new friend as a suspect spy . Vaguely , but with deep melancholy , Zotov begins to feel a sense of personal guilt , to comprehend the impossible strain that the Soviet regime has placed upon all human relationships .
