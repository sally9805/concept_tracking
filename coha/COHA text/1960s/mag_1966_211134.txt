Forty-seven is a little late in life for a man to change his whole philosophy . But give Ralph Houk credit for trying . " Winning is all that counts , " he used to say . Houk was a winner then . Now that he 's a loser , he 's learning to act like one . Alibis : " Injuries have practically killed us . " Complaints : " The umpire really blew that one . " Pleas for sympathy : " We 're going through a period of unexpected events . " Promises , promises , promises : " We have some outstanding prospects . " <P> Not Since 1925 . A tobacco-chewing ex-Army officer and supernumerary ballplayer who hung around the big leagues for eight years ( although he got into only 91 games ) , Houk was known as the " Miracle Major " when he bossed the New York Yankees to three straight American League pennants before retiring to the front office in 1964 . Another miracle was obviously called for after the Yankees slumped to sixth place last year , got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May , when Manager Johnny Keane was fired , Houk took over the job again himself . <P> In the four months since , he has not performed the impossible , but he has performed the improbable . He has taken the Yankees from twelve games out of first place to 27 games out of first place . Last week the Yanks lost four straight to the pennant-bound Baltimore Orioles , thereby 1 ) dropping into the American League cellar and 2 ) mathematically eliminating themselves from the 1966 pennant race . Not since 1925 , when Babe Ruth hit only 25 home runs and got fined $5,000 by Manager Miller Huggins for breaking training , had the proud Yankees , winners of 20 world championships , been eliminated so early in the season . <P> The totality of the Yankee collapse seems to baffle Houk as much as anybody . " I 've never been with a losing club before , either as a manager or a player , " he mutters . Pitcher Mel Stottlemyre , a 20-game winner last year , is a 17-game loser this season . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is batting .238 . The team as a whole is batting .237 . They have lost 33 games by a margin of one run , and they have been unable even to beat their old patsies , the Washington Senators and the California Angels . <P> Injuries have played a part , of course . Pitcher Whitey Ford underwent surgery last month for a blocked artery in his shoulder . Shortstop Ruben Amaro tore his knee ligaments in the first week of the season . Mickey Mantle has missed 42 games with assorted aches and pains , and Roger Maris has been playing for three months with a torn leg muscle so painful that he can not run out the infield grounders he now hits so consistently . Still , Yankee teams have been hard hit before : the 1949 club , for example , survived a succession of 71 separate injuries and won a pennant for Manager Casey Stengel-the first of ten he collected in his twelve years with the Yanks .                   @ @
