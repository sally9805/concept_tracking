COUNTING MY STEPS by Jakov Lind. 223 pages . Macmillan . $5.95 . <P> <P> In one remarkable book , Soul of Wood , Jakov Lind fixed the grayed and monstrous mindscape of wartime Germany more vividly than any other writer except Gnter Grass . It is surprising , therefore , to realize that Lind , who was born in Vienna and lived out the war in Holland and Germany , is not a German author at all and now does not even write in German , his first language . He is , in fact , a 42-year-old Londoner ( by adoption ) who writes in English . His past still troubles him so that he refuses , for instance , to read the writing of most Germans , including Grass . The present book , an odd autobiography , is chiefly a record of personal transformations , marked by an oppressive list of allegiances abandoned . <P> The list begins with his parents-Viennese Jews who managed to ship him to Holland in 1938-and includes language , religion , several nationalities and identities . " To be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The war followed him to Holland . Successive Nazi raids emptied Amsterdam 's Jewish quarter , and Lind bought a new Aryan identity . His forged papers proved him to be Jan Overbeek , a 17-year-old Dutch laborer with an Austrian mother . At first , he recalls , " I spent most of my time studying my face in the mirror . I was Jan Overbeek , yes . But I did n't look like him . Not yet . My nose is straight , as straight as Hitler 's , but there was something wrong with my eyes . Not the sight , but the expression . The Germans thought the Jew is attached to his nose-the Jew was in the eyes . " <P> He forced himself to show a Dutchman 's overt hatred of Germans , and to feel indifference toward Jews ( as Jakov Lind he had despised , in the way a boy despises dull relatives , the Jews who let themselves be freighted off to concentration camps ) . Because Dutch laborers do not write , he stopped his habitual scribbling . " Writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something beautiful and pleasant that will only occur when one is allowed to live again . Jan Overbeek is a ghost , a shadow , a piece of printed paper with a fingerprint and a signature . . . ' I wish I were a flower , I might outlive this Autumn , ' I poeted , and flushed this bit of written evidence down the toilet . " <P> Eventually , anyone young and healthy in Holland was likely to be questioned by the Nazis . Boldly , Lind-Overbeek escaped to Germany . He worked , drank , survived bombardment , whored and eventually landed a surreal job carrying reports from an industrialist 's factory , which did metallurgical research , to the German Air Ministry . When the war ended , he set off , walking , for Holland . At the border , he molted another skin , persuading British officials that he was really Jakov Chaklan , born in Palestine . With a new identity card , he journeyed to Marseille and smuggled himself aboard a ship loaded with refugees bound for Israel . He was 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fall dead across the last page of corrected proofs , and Lind 's account is no exception . But the book has a certain unity . At the end , young Lind has fled and fumbled his way backward from extinction to his tribal beginnings , and is now as ready as any two-year-old to start life .
