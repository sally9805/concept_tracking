To the half-dozen kinds of oral contraceptives already on the U.S. market , all of which work on essentially the same principle , yet another was added last week . This one , say the manufacturers , works differently . <P> As nature has worked things out , a woman secretes a moderate amount of estrogenic hormones during the first ten or twelve days of her menstrual cycle . At about the time she ovulates , releasing into her Fallopian tubes an egg ready for fertilization , her output of estrogens rises sharply . Had it been at this higher level all along , she never would have ovulated . Soon after ovulation , estrogen output declines and there is a sudden increase in a different hormone-progesterone , sometimes called " nature 's contraceptive , " which prevents ovulation until the next cycle . <P> Until now , U.S. pills have relied on a synthetic progestin , akin to but more powerful than natural progesterone , to prevent ovulation by spreading its abundance over 20 days in mid-cycle . Only a minute quantity of estrogen was put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as 20 years ago , Boston 's Dr. Fuller Albright pointed out that a high level of estrogens in the first two-thirds of the cycle would prevent ovulation . To him , this indicated a practicable method of contraception . <P> The pills now approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for marketing by Mead Johnson &; Co. rely on the Albright proposal . Called " sequential therapy , " the new system uses 21 pills neatly stacked in a tube-16 white on top and five pink at the bottom . Working down the tube , a woman takes the first white pill ( an estrogen ) five days after beginning menstruation , and carries on with the white pills on a one-a-day schedule until they are finished . Then she takes the pink pills ( a progestin ) daily for five days . By thus imitating nature , say Mead Johnson and its medical investigators , the new pills provide almost 100% protection against conception , and they have almost no side effects .               @ @ @ @ @ @
