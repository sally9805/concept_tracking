Songs just popped into his head . Or so Frank Loesser liked to say . " Of course , " he would concede , " your head has to be arranged to receive them . Some people 's heads are arranged so that they keep getting colds . I keep getting songs . " During a 35-year show-business career , Loesser caught songs by the hundreds and infected millions with his melodious malady . Originally a lyricist , he came into his own as a composer-writer with the rousing Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition and the poignant Spring Will Be a Little Late This Year , both World War II favorites . Then came the series of Broadway musicals that placed him firmly in the company of such show-business greats as Cole Porter , Jerome Kern and Richard Rodgers-Where 's Charley ( 1948 ) , Guys and Dolls ( 1950 ) , The Most Happy Fella ( 1956 ) and How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying ( 1961 ) . Based on Damon Runyon , Guys and Dolls was Loesser 's masterpiece ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical dice Broadway had seen in years . <P> Loesser was as single-minded about his work as any compulsive crapshooter . Rising at 5 every morning , he toiled long and hard , pruning his tunes and polishing his words . " For every song I let out , " he once said , " there are six in the basket that nobody will ever see . " A small ( 5 ft. 6 in. ) , tough-talking , chainsmoking man , he reminded some of George Raft , others of a Guys and Dolls bookie . To keep busy in his off hours he took up hobbies ( painting , carpentry ) , and from time to time he expressed the hope that they would help him give up the smoking habit . But he remained a three-pack-a-day man , and last week Loesser died in a Manhattan hospital of lung cancer . He was 59 . <P> Monosyllable Champion . After Cole Porter , Loesser was probably the greatest American composer-lyricist . They were both superb melodists , but Loesser was not as interested in sophisticated word play as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Loesser " was a champion of the one-syllable word . " As good proof as any is this line from the title song from Guys and Dolls : <P> When a bum buys wine like a bum <P> ca n't afford , It 's a cinch that the bum is under <P> the thumb of some little broad . <P> It is a song that epitomizes Loesser 's direct style . Rarely was his music concerned exclusively with itself . The lyrics came first , and he proved it by the way he wedded his tunes to the rhythms of the words-by the way he always left room in his songs for a good laugh . Loesser also had a knack for turning the harsh into the lyric . While Guys and Dolls was still on its pre-Broadway tour , Loesser became fascinated with a line in Abe Burrows ' book and decided to make a song out of it : The Oldest Established Permanent Floating Crap Game in New York .                   @ @
