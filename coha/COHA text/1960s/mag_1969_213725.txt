When menaced by a revolver-brandishing intruder in his new play , Woody Allen implores , " Do n't pull the trigger . I 'm a bleeder ! " Though no shot is fired , Play It Again , Sam is riddled with laughs . Apart from being a hemophiliac , Allen 's latest hero , Allan Felix , is an exposed ganglion of neuroses , guilts and self-recriminations . He looks like a wilted scarecrow that would cringe at a sparrow 's chirp . He has so many psychological hang-ups that he makes playgoers feel positively healthy , which may be why they tend to love him . <P> Allan Felix 's problem in the play is that no one seems to love him . His wife has just left him . He is too inept to cook even a frozen TV dinner , though he does relish licking it . His best friend ( Anthony Roberts ) and his best friend 's wife ( Diane Keaton ) round up several miniskirted cuties for him , but nothing happens . Even in his fantasies , girls reject him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bogart . Bogey ( Jerry Lacy ) coaches him . Result : he ends up in bed with his best friend 's wife . More guilt , more self-recrimination . Too much more of the same , perhaps , for the play does not properly progress along with the evening . However , it is amusement enough to have Woody Allen 's kooky angle of vision , his nimble jokes and his woefully unconfident presence .
