Edward Estlin Cummings ' father , a Congregational minister , shocked his staid parishioners in Boston 's Old South Church one Sunday by crying from the pulpit : " The Kingdom of Heaven is no spiritual roof garden : it 's inside you ! " <P> Poet E. E. Cummings , who died last week in New Hampshire at 67 , spent a lifetime saying much the same thing . His tools were secular , but he practiced a religion nonetheless . It was the romantic individualist 's religion of the heart , in which love is not an emotion but a deity . Its creed was faith in the miracle of man 's individuality , his capacity for delight in beauty , in spring , in flowers , in girls . Its galaxy of devils , which grew as Cummings observed the modern world ( " a hoax of clocks and calendars " ) , included dry intellects , science , mass thought , security worship , Sigmund Freud-everything inside man or outside him that tends to limit his individualism , to reduce his sense of wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treacherous bright streets <P> of memory comes my heart , singing like <P> an idiot , ' whispering like a drunken man <P> who ( ata certain corner , suddenly ) meets he tall policeman of my mind . Or , in more succinct Cummingsese : " Not for philosophy does this rose give a damn . " For Cummings , the rose-and indeed the whole world-was a cause of wonder , and the words that he poured out in anger or tribute trace his lyrical journey through its mysteries . After his death , poets and critics were quick to speak of him as " the greatest innovator in modern poetry , " as a man who perfected " the idiom of American common speech . " Some placed him beside Thoreau and Whitman in " the pantheon of American letters . " Cummings would have disliked the portentous phrase . He was not the sort of artist who can easily be put in any resounding literary hierarchy . <P> He was popular-next to Robert Frost , by far the most popular contemporary U.S. poet . He won prizes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry . He was delightfully unpredictable . There was Cummings the crazy syntactical iconoclast who rarely used capital letters and recklessly ( often unintelligibly ) strewed syllables , commas and other gimcracks around the page . On the next page , though , he would turn up as a solemn , sonnet-writing traditionalist-or as Cummings the dreadful punster ( " honey swoRkey mollypants " ) , or the pseudo pornographer happily smirking from the decks of his ship , the S.S. Van Merde : " May i feel said he ( i 'll squeal said she . . . ) . " <P> At his best , he was capable of turning out this : <P> since feeling is first <P> who pays any attention <P> to the syntax of things <P> will never wholly kiss you ; wholly to be a fool while Spring is in the world my blood approves , and kisses are a better fate than wisdom . . . then laugh , leaning back in my arms for life 's not a paragraph And death i think is no parenthesis Cummings ' heart-for-heart's-sake view 's were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today 's world . Modern poets usually come armed with shields of sinewy realism or are modishly cloaked in intellectual complexity . <P>
