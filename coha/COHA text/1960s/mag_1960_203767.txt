THE SILVER BACCHANAL ( 305 pp ) Rene F ? ; p-Miller-Atheneum ( $4.50 ) . Somewhere , some time , in southeastern Europe , the remnants of a beaten army shuffle into the city of Drohitz there to regroup before facing an unidentified enemy once more . These are the same weary , mud-stained troops who fought a hopeless battle for a useless hill in Allegorist F ? ; p-Miller 's The Night of Time , May 9 , 1955 ) ; and to them Drohitz is something more than a well-fed peasant town . It is the focus of their tront-lme dreams , a city of dazzling peacetime riches , of sunny , soft-bodied girls strolling along the Corso . In entering Drohitz. exults Gravedigger Adam Ember of the army 's medical corps " we belonged to life once more . " Dead Wrong . Ember , the passive tattered Everyman of both novels is dead wrong At first . Drohitz girls and Drohitz gilt shops make the troops royally wel come .

The Mashinka is quarantined ; a grimly comic campaign is organized to fight the disease . Drohitzers who might have been exposed are rounded up and lodged in the Silver Hall , the mirror-lined banquet room of the Mashinka 's most fashionable bordello . Confinement quickly erases the difference between whore and housewife , who come to share each other 's concerns : a prim matron tries a striptease , the prostitutes study cake recipes . Eventually quarantine proves ineffective . The infection rages through Drohitz and the surrounding countryside and Ember , promoted from subaltern to Commissioner of Deceased Persons , runs out both coffins and burial parties . At novel 's end the army marches off to another regrouping point , still expecting ' ever new and more glorious victories .

Wider in scope , The Silver Bacchanal reveals man as an Absurd Animal , torn between hope and despair , ideal love and an insatiable lust . F ? ; p-Miller 's instrument of dissection is irony , e.g. , the army 's bureaucratic campaign against disease-carrying houseflies , in which the city is divided into sectors manned by bumbling brigades of swatters . But the laughter evoked is hollow ; the comedy is as cheerless as the triptychs of Hieronymus Bosch . <P> Written originally in German , Bacchanal is afflicted with a left-footed translation . <P> It also suffers from F ? ; p-Miller 's one-dimensional characterization : across a symbolic landscape , only sardonic Adam Ember ( Hungarian for " man " ' ) plods with recognizably human gait . But despite such weaknesses , The Silver Bacchanal is genuinely disturbing as a brutish vision of the dark cravings that often lurk beneath the thin texture of civilization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
