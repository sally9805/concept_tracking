My first recollection of Lyndon Johnson dates back to 1941 , when I was twelve . Johnson , then a Congressman representing a district many miles to the east of us , was running for the U.S. Senate . One morning I walked the half-mile from our shabby old farmhouse to the rural-route mailbox . There I found what even then I recognized as the literature of a political pitchman . The candidate was frozen in the poses I would later get to know so well : smiling from a platform as folks reached up to shake his hand , serious as he talked with a rural pharaoh , radiating cheer in the traditional family photo where hair was slicked down , dresses starched to a fault , and everybody looked as if he 'd stepped out of a bandbox . What made this campaign pamphlet especially memorable for me was a red-letter pledge bannered across the top : THE DAY LYNDON JOHNSON MUST VOTE TO SEND YOUR SON TO FOREIGN WARS , THAT DAY LYNDON JOHNSON WILL LEAVE CONGRESS AND GO WITH HIM . With Japan warring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a dramatic pledge ; to a small boy who saw only glory and medals in the bloodletting it was a heroic one. * Standing barefoot by that mailbox a quarter of a century ago , I became an instant LBJ man . Johnson did not win the Senate seat in 1941 . He lost by only 1,200 votes to W. Lee ( Pappy ) O'Daniel , that sprightly demagogue and hillbilly singer who had emerged from a flour salesman 's obscurity to the Texas governorship by shouting radio hosannas in the name of the Old Folks , the Alamo , and Jesus Christ . The Texas Election Bureau prematurely announced that Johnson had won . When a flood of O'Daniel votes came in from the boondocks and pine thickets two or three days later , the reversal came as a bitter disappointment to me . At this point I had not only never seen Johnson ; I had never even heard the sound of his voice . The Depression had lingered on our sandy farm long after the nation had achieved some measure of recovery . We had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew LBJ only as a face smiling from posters nailed to fence posts and from stories in week-old newspapers cadged each Sunday from our more affluent neighbors . Yet these so impressed me that once , while helping my father harvest corn , I was prattling enthusiastically *Johnson fulfilled his promise . Obtaining leave from the House after Pearl Harbor , he served in the Southwest Pacific for eight months , until President Roosevelt ordered all Congressmen on active duty to return to Washington.about Lyndon Johnson and turned a team of horses so short the flatbed wagon flipped over and very nearly maimed me . " Boy , " my father asked , " do n't you never think about nothin ' but Lyndon Johnson and football ? " A Neophyte 's Glimpse of Power Iwould not see Johnson for another thirteen years , when he was campaigning for reelection to the U.S. Senate in 1954 ( he had been first elected in 1948 by his memorable 87-vote margin ) . I was then a newspaper reporter deep in oil-andMcCarthy country , an area where most people believe in a flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Odessa to give a speech . It was a conventional one : service to the good folks of Texas , love of country and faith in the free-enterprise system , the soil , and Heaven 's Plan . There were the usual homilies , the same hoary political jokes , the same cardboard poses I had gotten to know in other candidates . I left disappointed by my first glimpse of The Great Man . Besides , boyhood idolatry has a way of vanishing . and Johnson by this time had two strikes against him in my book : he had given Adlai Stevenson only token support in 1952 , and he had remained too long silent while the McCarthyites treated us to their national spook show . But Johnson 's Democratic opponent in the primary reawakened my allegiance . Douglas T. Daugherty campaigned in a red fire truck and made speeches that would have frightened George III . He favored quitting the UN , going back to the Hoover Dollar , making deep knee bends to King Oil , and cleaning " the Godless Commies " out of the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enroll again in Lyndon Johnson 's cause . Through that summer I tacked posters , sealed envelopes , and spoke for Johnson to vest-pocket rallies of ten-folks-anda-rooster in remote villages like Wink , Crane , and No Trees . I went to Washington in late 1954 with a freshman Congressman who , after noting my talents in menial tasks , had chosen me for his administrative assistant . Johnson was Texas ' senior Senator and Larry L. King , a frequent contributor to " Harper 's , " has written articles on Washington lobbyists and administrative assistants , and on Southern fundamentalists . He is the author of " The One-Eyed Man " ( recently published by New American Library ) , which J. K. Galbraith called the best political novel since " The Last Hurrah . " 54 MY HERO UM in any but the most flattering of terms , or if he groused about working overtime . Once in a while I encountered the Senator in the Capitol Building , and if he saw me we might exchange quick nods or a rare smile . Generally , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his companion 's face and speaking with some dreadful urgency that blinded him to mere earthlings . The Johnson who rattled the Capitol 's staid walls with mad hoo-hawing and aimless goddamning , crowded you like a pickpocket while he poured on the persuasive goose grease , or who threatened , cajoled , or compromised his way through the political jungles was still to me a shadowy myth composed of corridor whispers , poker-table legends , and newspaper superlatives . A Coolie Turns Sour Sometime in 1958 I began to see Senator Johnson a bit more frequently . At one meeting in his office , representatives of a half-dozen executive agencies spent an hour enumerating to several of us the reasons why a new international bridge between the U.S. and Mexico could not be built at El Paso . Johnson crossed his long legs , feet propped up on his desk , and drawled , " Now , boys , you-all spent the last hour tellin ' me why we ca n't open up another international bridge . Now I want every one of you to give me one reason why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell out of here and open it ! " ( They did ? and LBJ cut the dedication ribbon . ) I had drinks a couple of times in the Majority Leader 's suite in the Capitol along with Texas Congressmen , other administrative assistants , and favored Johnson staffers . In these sessions LBJ 's conversation ranged broadly : a current political problem in Texas , chances of passing a Reciprocal Trade bill , an anecdote about Franklin D. Roosevelt , a stinging parody of Dwight D. Eisenhower . ( He would screw his face into a frown , mimic Eisenhower 's flat , clipped speech , and give us his version of the Eisenhower syntax : " Now , I may not know everything there is about this bill , Senator , and I might make what you might call a mistake now and then , but I am what you might call sincere about this . .. " ) . Suddenly he would bark a question at an aide about tomorrow 's schedule , turn his head abruptly to ask a Congressman " what you 're gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill comes to the Floor , " or grab a telephone to dial another Senator . Sitting under a life-sized oil portrait of himself that was illuminated by indirect lights , hisin-the-flesh person looking down an us from his subtly elevated executive 's chair , Senator Johnson was invariably jovial and full of hope . I enjoyed these performances hugely . I saw the famed Johnson temper for the first time in 1959 , during a three-day tour of duty that seemed no longer than a century . Senator Johnson came to my home district as part of a state-wide tour designed to solidify the political base in Texas from which he would seek the Presidential nomination the following year . It fell to my lot to act as " advance man " ? the nearest thing the Western World has to a Chinese coolie . The advance man arranges for halls , podiums , luncheons , or dinners , keys to the city , press conferences , hotel accommodations , rendezvous between the visiting pooh-bah and his local political underlings , or a pitcher of water for the dignitary 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where at ceremonial functions , and tries to discourage bores or potential troublemakers who might embarrass the Official Presence . Johnson 's own staff attended to many of these details , but as resident coolie I was responsible for being on hand to guide everyone through the proper jig-steps . At his first appearance , on the mezzanine floor of a downtown hotel where he spoke to about a hundred local leaders and their wives , Senator Johnson 's performance could have served as a blueprint for the Compleat Cornpone Politician . He was charming , relaxed , and lean . He slouched on the podium , grinning boyishly , pulling at his ear , saying how grand it was for " me and Lady Bird to get out of the steel and stone of the cities and come back here to feel the soil of home under our feet , and draw close to all the things we hold dear while we gaze on the Texas moon . " He invited all hands to " drop by and see us when you 're in Washington . " He reported that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes Bird bakes a buncha little cookies in the shape of the State of Texas to go with the coffee . " ( This earned a standing ovation and Rebel yells . ) He confessed to vast stores of humility , giving credit for " whatever I may amount to " in equal measure to Celestial Beings , his mother , and everybody present . When he had finished he ambled off to mingle with the crowd , pressing flesh , cooing low , kissing old ladies on the cheek as if he had flushed a covey of favored maiden aunts . Then the party broke up and the Senator 's official group retired toward his suite for a brief rest before the evening 's scheduled dinner . With the closing of the elevator door LBJ 's sunny smile gave way to thunderstorm expressions . " Goddamnit , " he said by way of openers , " nobody told me I was supposed to make a speech ! Did n't know it until I saw the damned podium . Up till then I thought it was just gon na be coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me down to the blood . " Why in hell did n't you tell me they expected a speech out there ? You think I 'm a mind reader ? Hah ? " I did n't think " Yes " was the proper answer , but I was mortally afraid to say " No . " So I said nothing . Within the next twenty-four hours Senator Johnson had berated me and his staffers because ( II his hotel bed was too short and " I have to scrootch my legs up until I fold up like a goddamn accordion " ; ( 21 nobody could locate Senator Dick Russell of Georgia on the telephone at the snap of a finger ; ( 3 ) we were late for three consecutive appointments because " half of you are crawlin ' , half of you are walkin ' , and none of you are runnin ' , " and ( 4 ) he could n't immediately find his reading spectacles . In another town where a press conference had been scheduled ( and to which I had clearly heard Johnson agree the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed knowledge of it only as he entered the hotel where local reporters waited . He blew up in the lobby and threatened not to appear . He was finally steered into the hotel ballroom , but not before his histrionics caused passersby to congregate and investigate the commotion . One reporter repeatedly baited Johnson with hostile questions . Finally , ignoring him completely , Johnson silently pointed to somebody else . When the heckler persisted the Senator snapped , " That 's it . Thank you , boys . " He plunged out of the ballroom , the rest of us chasing along , though handicapped by not having heard the starter 's gun . In the elevator the Senator 's first words were : " Which one of you do I thank for this little lynching ? " No one stepped forward to claim the medal . Those were Johnson 's last words for the next fifteen minutes as he brooded silently , staring at the television set in his room . The rest of us stared and brooded with him . I was terrified that I might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson and elevators not apparent to the eye . Some of his greatest conniptions have been thrown there . Likely , however , this is true because elevators happen to be the first place he is able to drop the necessary public poses and give vent to human frustrations . At any rate , my one head-to-head battle with Johnson started in an elevator the night before he would mercifully leave our district . Following a dinner where he had flashed his usual mixture of country charm and worldly knowledge , the Senator barked directly at me : " Who was that redheaded son-of-a-bitch set two chairs down from me ? " I groped for the redheaded SOB 's identity , but at that moment I could not have read my own name off a billboard . " Whoever he was , " Johnson said , " I do n't want that goofy SOB sittin ' in the same room with me again . Ruined mah whole night . . . " He trailed off into mumbles , glaring . The hour was late . I was tired , and just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off from home . In his room the Senator was unhappy because a delegation of local citizens required entertainment . I would have gladly done the job . It required nothing more strenuous than pouring a little whiskey , laughing at the punch lines of old jokes , and massaging shriveled egos . Senator Johnson , however , assigned this choice duty to his own permanent staff people . He thrust a slip of paper in my hand . Just before plunging into the bathroom he said , " I want these people in that exact order . " The note required two telephone calls to Washington , one to New York , one to Austin , and two or three more to small Texas towns . There was n't a telephone number on the slip . I sat on my hands and ! et my juices boil . When the Senator entered the room he gave me one quick glance . Then he asked the room-at-large to whom he had given the note . Eventually all eyes turned my way . It was like standing in front of a firing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I 'm tired of being your lackey while your staff people sit on their rumps and drink whiskey . I 've got my own man to lackey for . " ( The last sentence was spoken with some strange , hot pride ? which shows what being a second-banana politician will do for your sense of values . i I have the vague recollection that somebody dropped an ashtray . One of Johnson 's staffers suddenly snatched the note from my hand and whisked it away , presumably to the nearest telephone . I am unable to recall the Senator 's immediate reaction to the mutiny . Everyone seemed frozen in place . My ears throbbed blood as I plunged from the room . A friend stumbled out behind me , eyes wide and face pale . I would hesitate to quote him exactly , but I think he called on his Lord in a hoarse voice and asked if I had lost my goddamned mind . While I raved about holding Senator Johnson 's hat , carrying his bags , and being treated like a stepchild , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he might be flagging the Greyhound . He desperately begged that I go someplace to " get a beer , cool off , and for God 's sake stay out of Lyndon 's sight . " I cooled off enough to worry about whether I 'd that he sang praises to the 271/2 per cent oil-depletion allowance under which the rich get richer and the poor pay taxes . As a working pol , I could understand his dilemma . He represented a state largely oriented toward the Southern viewpoint , a state where schoolboys are taught that oil is the backbone of the economy and is , therefore , sacred . What disappointed me most about Johnson was that he threw his considerable weight and prestige into the camp of mossbacks who held Texas as if it were their own grand duchy . The Texas Establishment has opposed social reforms to the extent of perpetuating oppression , ignorance , and poverty . Even today , Texas ranks at or near the bottom of the 50 states in aid to the blind , aged , and mentally ill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routinely vetoed appropriations to improve hospitals , libraries , prisons , and old-age pensions . They have cheerfully signed " right-to-work " laws and harsh segregation measures . Legislators have urged soak-the-poor taxes on bread , work clothes , and medicines . They have permitted loan sharks to charge usurious rates and have refused to enact any laws protecting the state 's thousands of migratory farm laborers who are carted from farm to hovel in open cattle trucks . They have openly cavorted with the fat-cat lobbyists . They have damned the federal government for foreign aid , aid to education , the antipoverty program , and the Peace Corps . I am not speaking here of John Birch Republicans nor even of Eisenhower ones , but of Tory Democrats who have made the wheels of influence go in Texas . If any man had the power and finesse to move Texas toward a more moderate , enlightened political climate it was Lyndon Johnson . He chose not to use his talents in that direction at all . He did not stay on the sidelines while the liberals fought desperately for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invariably cast his lot with the Tories . He saw the labor-liberal bloc as a rising threat to his grip on Texas . Time after time he fused patchwork coalitions that effectively crushed liberal hopes of gaining a voice in the Democratic party . Working within the framework of the Establishment ? i.e. , the Governor , the State Democratic Executive Committee , and local political bosses ? Lyndon Johnson got what he wanted . What he wanted was , simply , control . Visiting Barons Atypical display of Johnson 's tactics occurred at the Democratic state convention in Fort Worth in 1956 . As in past years , Johnson and crusty old Speaker Sam Rayburn arrived from Washington like visiting feudal barons . They received in their hotel rooms , and if you had business to transact you sought them out with a smile on your face . They brought along a coterie of Texas Congress- Of his boyhood hero , author King says , " Lyndon Johnson is far too complex to be wholly captured by any one writer in any given piece . This narrative tends to dwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps this is because my relatively few firsthand personal observations of the man occurred in the hectic mainstream of workaday politics . " There are other sides to Lyndon Johnson . He can be fiercely loyal , gregariously funny , mawkishly sentimental , and as charming in his way as John F. Kennedy was in his . I have seen him cry real tears when speaking of his late mother , a crash that killed his airplane pilot , or when simply recalling shoulder-to-shoulder battles with an old political pal . As a committed liberal , I personally think that no President has done more for the country in the way of progressive domestic legislation . " Yet in so public a man and so flamboyant a personality flaws are destined to loom large . His Achilles ' heel is a supersensitivity to criticism ? probably to a greater degree than any President in history . He has a regrettable tendency to strike back at his detractors . Edward P. Morgan put it well : He has never quite fully understood that the press is not a private instrument but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leverage of a crowbar , if necessary , to keep the doors and windows of an open society open . ' " made ? or pretended to be made ? by a handful of old biddies I knew largely from seeing their pictures on the society page . Once I tried to get some direction from the man said to be nominally in charge : Marvin Watson , then a Texas steel executive on loan to Johnson and now a top White House aide . Watson cheerfully confessed that he had n't much notion of what we might do to help . Then he continued dictating a letter to some agitated Dixie mystic who had written in about " the nigger problem . " Watson solemnly explained that Lyndon B. Johnson 's " roots are in the South and his heart is with the South . " He mentioned the Senator 's heroic old Confederate soldier granddaddy . Eventually , about all I found to do was dictate letters of the same type . Almost all of Johnson 's mail came from the South or the flatlands Midwest . Much was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many letters were Doomsday tracts of the type handed out on street corners by trembling , popeyed prophets . Others were directed against John F. Kennedy as " the Pope 's candidate , " or railed against plots by the UN to take over the Pentagon , or spoke of Alaskan concentration camps being prepared for the enemies of Hubert Humphrey . Obviously , there was not a delegate vote in a carload of such correspondents . Just as obviously , LBJ was at that stage the candidate of Tory Democrats of the world . Johnson 's advisers mistakenly assumed that tactics successful in Texas would prove workable nationally . In Texas you cuddled to the Establishment by making alliances of convenience.You used your Congressional influences where they best served , by manipulating young legislators eager for seats in close proximity to the Congressional leaders , or by logrolling with cynical , horse-trading old pro pols . Thus did Johnson partisans set out to form a coalition of Dixiecrats , aging New Dealers whose visions had dimmed even as their paunches had increased , and Congressmen or Senators thought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson and Rayburn . I suggested to Walter Jenkins that somebody needed to take the campaign firmly in hand . Jenkins listened a bit impatiently to my complaints . Perhaps it is well my advice was offered free , for he seemed not to set a high value on its worth . " The Senator 's got a world of faith in John Connally , " he said . Then he pointedly added , " I have , too . " He blandly said that Johnson would capture all the Southern states , that old New Deal cronies would deliver " a lot of votes in the North and East not apparent on the surface , " and that endorsements had been lined up from Congressional powers " all across the nation . " ( Asked for examples , Jenkins named Representative Ralph Rivers of Alaska and Senator Thomas Dodd of Connecticut . ) He said Johnson would " naturally appeal " in Western states such as New Mexico , Arizona , and Wyoming . " He even claimed certain influences for Senator Johnson in California , adding that " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of years ? running an elevator in an office building . " Thereafter , I privately thought of Johnson 's campaign headquarters as " Disneyland East . " Typical of these elusive " supporters " was Senator Gale McGee of Wyoming . In May of 1960 , with the national convention about two months away , Jenkins asked me to accompany a Texas Congressman , another from Alaska , and a former Congressional delegate from Hawaii , into Wyoming . Our assignment was to see to it that the state Democratic convention adopt a motion binding delegates to the national convention under a unit rule ? meaning that all delegates , regardless of their personal preferences , would be under instruction at the national convention to vote for the candidate earlier endorsed at the state level . Walter Jenkins was certain that in Wyoming that man would be Johnson . " Go see Gale McGee , " Jenkins ordered . " He 'll cooperate one hundred per cent . " He exhibited the latest issue of Time quoting Senator McGee on Senator Johnson : " He 'd make a hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McGee chatted pleasantly with me , praised Johnson , and gave the name of his local campaign manager in Casper who " will give you anything we 've got . " In Casper , I asked Senator McGee 's man what we might do toward locking up Wyoming 's delegates under the unit rule . He was abashed ; why , he 'd been instructed to be strictly impartial ; he could n't take sides because Senator McGee was adopting a " hands-off " policy . I told him this was news to me and no doubt would be news to Senator Johnson . After two days of politicking in Wyoming , it was apparent that Washington had misjudged the situation . Almost everyone favored Kennedy , including State Chairman Teno Roncalio , who would control the delegation 's fifteen votes . In these circumstances the unit rule could be disastrous to Johnson 's hopes . When we conveyed this news to Jenkins , he suggested that we should reverse ourselves . Rather than seeking to " solidify and harmonize " delegates under the unit rule , we should fight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd unless we got the Vice-Presidential nominee on the platform . Somebody , I suggested , should pass this word . Hand suggested that I pass it . Foolishly , I did . . Johnson poked a finger at me in a quick , stabbing motion and barked , " You get outta here ! " As I retreated he demanded that the door be closed after me . Five minutes later the door opened and Johnson led his entourage out . Though he acknowledged cheers with a wave of his hat , his smile seemed strained . Someone had prevailed on Johnson to call Kennedy 's plane , explain the situation , and request permission to get out . Permission was granted . Having to ask , however , had not noticeably improved Senator Johnson 's personality . He fidgeted on the platform while a dozen Congressmen and state officials made war-whooping partisan speeches . When Senator Kennedy arrived he spoke briefly , after LEJ had introduced him , inviting the crowd to his speech the following morning in El Paso Plaza . Johnson sat glumly on the platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leaving the airport Johnson was further unsettled when the crowd spilled from behind restraining barriers , surged against the nominees as they made for waiting automobiles , and almost swept Mrs. Johnson off her feet . She clutched at her husband and said something , her face white . I- heard Johnson snap , " For God 's sakes , clear a path ! Somebody 's gon na get killed . " The Hotel Cortez was so crowded with cheering hordes we could hardly force our way into the elevators . I was pushed into an elevator and wedged between Kennedy and County Judge Woodrow Bean . Bean was babbling about the moment being " the greatest in Texas history " while .1FK silently smiled and nodded . The floor where Kennedy and Johnson had been booked proved to be a madhouse . Much of the crowd had eluded special policemen stationed on the stairs . Seeing the confusion Kennedy said quickly to the elevator operator , " close the door . " This done he ordered , " Stay here until they 're dispersed . " Somebody handed Kennedy an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cupping the peelings in his hand until I relieved him of them . When no one was looking I slipped them into Judge Bean 's coat pocket . Unfortunately , Johnson 's elevator operator had dumped him into the milling crowd in the hall and he took another buffeting . By the time we arrived in Kennedy 's " Presidential Suite , " Senator Johnson was waiting there in a new rage . " Goddamnit , " he yelled to Lloyd Hand , " where 's Speaker Rayburn ? " Hand said that " he was in September 11 , 1960 : The author 's campaign camera catches his Congressman and Senator Kennedy ( holding the orange ) in the El Paso hotel suite . the hall a couple of minutes ago . " LBJ said , " I do n't give a damn where he was a couple of minutes ago ! I asked you where he is now ! " Hand disappeared to hunt the Speaker . Kennedy sat on a couch to eat his orange . My Congressman , Slick Rutherford , sat down by him . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in the campaign . Kennedy quickly hid the orange , and gave my Congressman his full attention . After I 'd finished taking pictures he resumed eating the orange . A Kennedy staffer began clearing the room , now overflowing with local officials and unknown ga ? - kers . He was pushing me out also ( the camera leading him to think I was a newspaper photographer ) until Kennedy called , " No , he 's with us . " I then asked Senator Kennedy to pose with my Congressman , Senator Johnson , and Speaker Rayburn . Kennedy nodded , and called across the room now free of hangers-on : " Lyndon ! " Johnson was in Sam Rayburn 's face , crying out some terrible woe and emphatically poking the Speaker 's chest with that stabbing forefinger . The Speaker looked tired and faintly agonized . Kennedy called again : " Senator Johnson ! " Still no answer . Lloyd Hand plucked furtively at Senator Johnson 's sleeve . LBJ whirled on him : " Ca n't you see I 'm talkin ' with the Speaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture , " Senator Kennedy called . Johnson snorted a pithy expletive . Kennedy grinned . He said , " Settle down , Lyndon . It 's a long time until November , "
