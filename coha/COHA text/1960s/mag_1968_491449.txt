They 're from middle-class suburban families , and they have the money to buy all they need , yet these teen-agers pull 15,000 shoplifting thefts a day . Here 's a disturbing report on a growing nationwide epidemic  --  and the reasons behind it . By Bill Davidson T he pretty blonde store detective spotted the two teen-age girls the instant they walked into the lingerie department . " Those girls are going to steal , " she said . " How do you know ? " I asked . " Just instinct , " she said . We saw the girls pick up five bras and a girdle and take them into the fitting rooms . The detective followed and watched them in a concealed overhead mirror . One girl put on one bra over her own and slipped back into her sweater . The second girl stuffed two bras into each of her coat pockets and slid the girdle down inside her skirt . They then left the fitting room and walked out of the lingerie department . They were heading up an Escalator when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hardly a whimper as she escorted them to the security office and called the police . While they waited for the squad car to arrive , the store detective filled out forms , and the youngsters wrote and signed confessions . One girl was the daughter of an attorney , the other of a contractor . Both were truants from school in a wealthy suburb outside Chicago  --  it was one o'clock in the afternoon  --  and they had been on a morning-long crime spree . The attorney 's daughter wrote ; " We got a lift to the shopping center with three boys . We went to a store and had something to drink , and Vicki took some records and some nylons . We went to another store and took three lipsticks each and seven pairs of earrings . Then we came to this store and put the stuff we took in a locker and went looking around.We took four cigarette lighters . We came downstairs and looked at some underwear . We took five bras and a girdle , and a lady came up to us and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should he punished , because I will never do it again , and we did n't take much . " When the juvenile officer arrived from the local police department , he added up the value of the shoplifted items . It totaled $96.33 . Both girls were taken into custody and later given one year of " supervision " by a probation officer . The important thing about this teen-age shoplifting incident I witnessed is that approximately 15.000 similar thefts were taking place on that same day in stores all over the United States . Professional security consultants estimate that there are about 100,000 teen-age shopliftings a week ( compared with only a few thousand a decade ago ) , and FBI statistics show that shoplifting arrests have increased by almost 80 percent in the last five years . There are estimates that American merchants lose from one billion to three billion dollars every year to shoplifters , and most experts will tell you that more than half of these thieves are now teen-agers  --  the great majority of them white , and from middle-class suburban families . Municipal Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it " the phenomenon of the teen-age thrill thief . " Judge Wolf says , " Most of these kids have plenty of money . They steal just for the hell of it  --  the way they smoke pot . But to me it 's more serious than pot , because it 's an indication of how their moral values have decayed . It 's gotten worse than juvenile crime in the Negro ghettos , which the parents of these well-to-do kids frequently are the first to denounce . It 's a major-league , hushed-up American scandal  --  one of the most disturbing developments I 've seen since I 've been on the bench . " There are no geographical boundaries to the current epidemic of teen-age shoplifting . It is raging in every city and town in the United States , according to the National Retail Merchants Association , One six-store chain in the New York area reported more than 4,000 juvenile arrests last year ; in the Atlanta area , where two million dollars a year is stolen from merchants , police lieutenant W. A. Jones says that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? In a department-store branch in a shopping center in the San Fernando Valley near Los Angeles , I saw it take two hours for a policeman to arrive to pick up a teen-age shoplifter apprehended by store detectives . The cop apologized for the delay . He said he had been busy with 26 other arrests that afternoon in that shopping center alone . ? In Caldor , a chain discount store in rural western Connecticut , Mrs. Rita Nichols , a store detective , told me the made 110 arrests during the last Christmas season . An Englishwoman who had been trained by British Intelligence to protect military canteens from theft , she said , " I 'm appalled at the extent of stealing by children in this country . " ? In San Diego a 15-year-old girl entered a department store and then left , looking as if she had gained 15 pounds . She was stopped and anarched . Under her clothing she wore 12 of the store 's bikini bathing suits , one on top of the other . Her only explanation : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? In Boston a boy was apprehended with seven LP phonograph records secreted between pages of a loose-leaf notebook . In the trunk of his car detectives found 82 other records , all taken in relays from the same music store on the same afternoon . ? In Jacksonville . Fla. , a 17-year-old secretary was picked up by detectives . In her purse she had a shoplifting list , made out like anyone else 's shopping list , She had written down 10 items , ranging from hosiery to pillowcases . She had already stolen the first six items on her list and had them stashed snugly away in her huge purse . The last item on the list was " Anything to make the apartment more beautiful . " The typical teen-age shoplifter in the United States is a girl ( girls outnumber boys by about 20 to 1 in this particular area of crime , presumably because the young female devotes considerably more time to legal shopping too ) . She is likely to be 16 years old ( the dangerous ages are 15 to 17 for girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father probably is a business or professional man earning $15,000 a year or more . She gets a sizable allowance and has enough money to buy all she needs . When she is caught , she might well have enough cash in her purse to pay for what she has stolen . She will most frequently steal cosmetics , phonograph records , slacks , sweaters , bathing suits . costume jewelry , blouses , underwear , hosiery and dres.ses ( boys seem to concentrate on jackets , tools , small appliances and sophisticated toys ) . Unless she belongs to the small minni ay of drug addicts , she will not steal any thing to resell it ( cigarettes are the major item taken for resale ) . Instead , her shoplifting loot will be strictly for her own personal use and adornment . Her favorite target is the nearby branch of a downtown department store , but she will also plunder specialty clothing shops , supermarkets and drugstores . This typical teen-age shoplifter will brag to her friends about what she has " bagged , " " hocked , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word that is common to the vernacular of her region . Her shoplifting methods are crude , compared with those of the adult professionals , who use such ingenious devices as the so-called " Harpo Marx coat , " which has many enormous pockets and hooks on retractable springs to seize and retrieve merchandise . The teen-ager probably will simply stuff her contraband into her purse or a shopping bag and try to leave the store . Although she might get away with it the first few times , her methods are clumsy . and she eventually will he caught . What makes seemingly normal kids from above-average families steal ? Dr. Chaytor Mason . a Los Angeles clinical psychologist , advances one theory . He says , " It 's part of today 's widespread rebellion by our youth . Some kids express their dissatisfaction with adult society by taking drugs or becoming hippies . But many turn to shoplifting , which they think is safer and less radical . They seem to need to prove they do n't have to live within the rules and regulations of the adult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume a submissive role . Shoplifting is a means of self-expression for them  --  a way of saying , ' I 'm notobeying the rules . ' Many times they steal ridiculous things in a desire to defy . A girl , for example , may steal makeup or an uplift bra because her mother wo n't let her wear them . " This attitude is typified by a wealthy boy I interviewed at Emory University in Atlanta . He had just shoplifted a dozen paperback hooks from the college bookstore by slipping them under his $100 raincoat . One of the books he had stolen was the King James version of the Bible . He admitted he had been stealing since he was 12 , beginning with candy bars , but that he had given up candy " because it was causing too many cavities , " and had switched to books when he was a freshman in high school . " I 've always hated book reports , " he said . Asked about the ethics of his activities , he bridled and said , " I 've never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what about the chicanery of politicians and crooked businessmen ? I 'll only quit shoplifting when I can convince myself that it 's as serious as society tries to make it . It 's just fun . " This " fun " angle , according to Joseph Giunta of the Illinois Youth Commission , is at the very heart of the problem . Giunta told me . " Today 's kids do n't seem to think of shoplifting as a crime , but rather as a game called ' beat the system . ' It never occurs to them that stealing a thirty-dollar dress is no different from stealing thirty dollars out of a store 's cash register . " Time after time I heard youngsters . apprehended by a store detective , say things like , " But , lady . I 'll put the stuff I took back . Do n't tell me I 'm going to be arrested for shoplifting ? " In Beverly Hills I spoke with two 15-year-old girls after they had tried to flee when they were caught leaving a store with $60 worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were handcuffed . The girls were enraged . " That was n't a very cool thing to do to us , " one of the girls sobbed . " Why , they treated us like criminals . " Bernard J. Lynch , probation officer of the juvenile court in Danbury , Conn. , tells of a boy remanded to him after an arrest for car theft . ' ' In talking with this youngster , " Lynch says , " I found out that he also is a chronic shoplifter . He even practices his shoplifting techniques at home , walking hunched over to become adept at avoiding TV cameras and mirrors . He feels that taking a car was wrong , but he was amazed when I told him his shoplifting was also a serious crime . I ca n't get through to him that he 'll violate his parole if he 's caught taking so much as a package of gum . He looks at me incredulously and says , ' You 're putting me on . ' Like most youngsters , he 's convinced that when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return the stolen merchandise and bygones will be bygones . " Sociologists blame several major factors for the teen-age shoplifter 's twisted sense of morality . First , there is what Alex Ackerman. a juvenile probation officer in Santa Monica , Calif .. calls " peer-group influence . " In layman 's terms , this means : " All the other kids do it , so why should n't I ? " Ackerman says , " With today 's kids , when a practice becomes widespread . it automatically becomes acceptable . Added to this is what we could call the ' I dare you ' factor . Teens just ca n't be ' square . ' " Successful shoplifting may even be part of the initiation ceremonies into high-school clubs and sororities . Fifteen girls recently were picked up by the police in a shopping center in West Los Angeles , Calif . They said they had to steal $100 worth ) 1 merchandise from certain stores . with price tags intact , in order to be accepted into a sorority . In the Vilmette-Winnetka , Ill. , area  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Carson Pirie Scott department-store chain uncovered what they later learned was called " The Cashmere Club . " Lester Rank , chief security officer of the stores , told me , " In order to become a member , a girl had to shoplift a cashmere sweater . We picked up two girls , and they told us about it . They led us to eight other kids . The girls were all from the best families . " Then there 's the matter of keeping up with the other kids . A high-school girl in an affluent Westchester County , N.Y. , suburb says , " Sometimes girls can brag that half of their wardrobes are made up of ' hocked ' ! shoplifted ' clothes in the new fashions . I can only think of one or two of my friends who do n't ' hock . ' " Richard McLaughlin , chief security officer of the May Company department stores on the West Coast , told me . " We shudder when a crazy new style takes hold . That 's when the teen-age shoplifters hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with the other kids . Last year it was black net stockings and Ben Franklin eyeglasses for the girls and Western-style shirts for the boys . " Probation officer Ackerman says , " It 's the pressure of the street . They musl conform . " Another major reason for the current epidemic of teen-age shoplifting ( according to Ackerman and most other experts ) is the parents of the thrill thieves . The May Company 's McLaughlin , a former FBI agent , says . " Children learn by example . They see their mothers eating grapes in a supermarket without paying for them , or slipping sticks of butter into an oleomargarine carton before going to the check-out counter , and they develop the philosophy that it 's all right to steal from a big , rich organization because nobody will miss it . Then they hear Daddy at home bragging about cheating his company on his expense account and the Government on his income-tax return . They 're taught from childhood that anything 's OK , just so long as you do n't get caught . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department store in Illinois . A mother and her 15-year-old daughter were arrested for shoplifting together . With them was the mother 's younger child , an infant boy only seven months old . They were using the baby 's diaper hag to hold the merchandise they had stolen . Tears flowed from both mother and daughter . They were not tears of remorse  --  just indignation at the plight in which they found themselves . Parents are to blame in less direct ways too . A junior at Beverly Hills High School in California told me , " A lot of kids I know steal just to embarrass their parents , because they feel their parents do n't love them . Their fathers are too busy with business and golf , and their mothers are all tied up with social activities . When these kids shoplift , I think they 're saying to their parents , ' I 'll get you to pay attention to me , even if you have to come to the police station to do it . ' " Juvenile officers of the Los Angeles Police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They point out that the wealthy community of Pacific Palisades has one of the highest rates of juvenile shoplifting arrests in Southern California . One policeman explains that Pacific Palisades is a town of movie executives . space engineers , " all people who are on the rise . ' Sgt. Shirley Maxwell says , " They seem to have time for just about everything  --  but their children " The usual reaction of such parents when they must retrieve their children from police custody after a shoplifting arrest is , " That ca n't be my child , what will my friends say ? " and " I 've given her everything  --  how could she do this to me ? " Sgt. Joe Bopp , a juvenile officer of the Mt . Prospect , Ill. , police department . asked one man how long it had been since he 'd spent more than a few minutes with his daughter . The father had to think before he flushed and answered , " I took her to the circus in Chicago , but that was  --  er  --  six weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of missing fathers here in Mt . Prospect . They go to work in Chicago and get home too late during the week to see their kids . On weekends they play golf. - In Denver a 14-year-old girl was arrested for shoplifting a dress . and it turned out she had a whole closet-full of stolen clothes at home . Her mother was n't even aware of her daughter 's new wardrobe . In a northern New Jersey suburb a boy was found to have 12 stolen $20 shirts in his closet ; his parents had never noticed them . Equally guilty is the overprotective parent whose child can do no wrong . Typical is the case of a 15-year-old attorney 's daughter who shoplifted $43 worth of merchandise in the Caldor store in Brookfield , Conn . The manager , Melvin Green . asked the girl 's mother to come to see him before the police arrived . The mother bustled into the office and said . " Do n't worry , kitten . I do n't know what you did , but Daddy will get you out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burnell caught a 14-year-old boy shoplifting pens . Called in by Burnell , the youngster 's mother said to her son , " I want you to apologize . " The boy apologized , and the mother exclaimed , " Today you are a man . I 'm so proud of you that I 'm going to buy you a soda . " There was no hint of punishment or even disapproval . Connecticut probation officer Bernard Lynch says , " Such mothers are contributing to the delinquency of their own minors . This boy is bound to steal again . He thinks all he has to do is apologize when he gets caught. - In a more tragic case . another boy with a permissive middle-class mother did n't stop at shoplifting . He progressed to car theft and drug addiction , and is now serving a term in the Youth Training School in Ontario , Calif . If the permissive parent is an important factor , so is the permissive store . In Beverly Hills a judge told me . " This town is a lost cause . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to lose their business , so when their customers ' kids steal , they just look the other way . " In the New York area a store which did n't want to stir up trouble by calling the police for juvenile shoplifting cases finally had to close its doors and go out of business . In Philadelphia one large department store has the policy of ' reasoning ' with teen-age shoplifters and their parents instead of prosecuting . The store has gained a reputation as an easy mark among the area 's children , and , according to the police , " is being stolen blind . " On the other hand , a big West Coast chain of department stores , The Broadway , arrests and prosecutes with no exceptions . " It works . " says the chain 's director of security , Bascom M. Shanks Jr . " Arresting young shoplifters proves N'er ? effective . It 's an unhappy experience for them . They learn their lesson . They rarely come back . " Capt . Jack Morris , head of a juvenile division of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not as harsh as it sounds . He says that a first offense , without any aggravated circumstances ( such as resisting arrest ) , is handled on an informal basis , in inait state. , will psychiatrik rea intent of the child prescribed when necessar Nita-Hs says , " We head olT a lot of budding criminal careers this way . " He points to Panorama City . Calif. , as an example that might well be follov , vcl throughout the country . Ile says that the Panorama City chamber of commerce worked nut a concerted program in which all stores agreed to call the police in every teen-age shoplifting case . " We do n't get many juvenile snitches there any more , " he says . Joseph Giunta of the Illinois Youth Commission would like to see state laws passed making it mandatory for all merchants to turn juvenile shoplifters over to the police . " That would take the onus off the merchant , " he says . ' ' He He could then tell the parent . ' I had to turn your son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In that way we 'd get the sick kids for psychiatric treatment before it 's too late . The problem 's ton serious to leave to the discretion of the merchants . " So far . though , the merchants do have the discretion , and , according to the National Retail Merchants Association , more and more of them  --  but not enough - are instituting the get-tough policy . The Caldor chain , in New York and New England , has cut its shoplifting losses , not only by prosecuting all offenders but also by requesting that their names be published in the local newspapers . Caldor 's security director . Burt Cohen , says , " We may have fewer customers because of this policy , but we 're making more money . " This statement has caused more optimism in the retailing business than anything else that has been said on the subject . Another consistently voiced criticism of stores is the manner in which they display their merchandise . Judge Wolf of Beverly Hills says . " They make it all so tempting for the shoplifter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counters . nice dark corners , ill-trained sales girls . It 's a paradise for the kleptomaniac  --  let alone impressionable kids who think , ' There are so many . How can just one be missed ? ' " Juvenile Court Judge Margaret C. Driscoll of Bridgeport . Conn. , says , " Unlimited abundance is emphasized in these stores . and they have become the principal targets of juvenile shoplifters . Almost casually , and with a minimum of conflict , essentially decent teen-agers become thieves , with no real awareness that any such disaster is taking place . " ? In most stores there has been a long-standing conflict between the security people and the merchandising people . The security specialists would like to see everything chained down or behind glass ; the merchandising experts insist that customers wo n't buy anything unless they can handle it freely . The merchandising people usually win . Only a few stores have taken any steps to remove temptation . The majority still concentrate on defection  --  with detectives , one-way mirrors in fitting rooms , convex mirrors to give broader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some stores . notably the Lord and Taylor chain , are beginning to think about prevention . New Lord and Taylor branches have closed display cases , and every area of die store is well-lit and observable . But most experts agree that there is only one ultimate solution to the problem of the teen-age thrill thief  --  the education of the youngsters themselves to the dangers of what they are doing . Less than five percent of the juvenile shoplifters are mentally ill or driven to kleptomania by had family situations at home . An even smaller percentage steal out of need , becauLe , as policemen consistently told me , " Poor kids understand better than well-to-do ones what it means to get into trouble with the law . " This ignorance on the part of the wealthier classes is what inevitably leads to tragedy . In Westwood , Calif. , a 17-year-old physician 's daughter shoplifted a two-dollar costume-jewelry brooch . She denied the theft to the police . and so automatically had to appear before the juvenile court for a hearing . She was found guilty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until she is 21 years old for until five years have passed from the day of her conviction  --  whichever comes first ) . The girl wants to become a lawyer , but the police record  --  because of a two-dollar theft  --  might keep her out of college or from getting a good job . Her probation officer , Alex Ackerman , says . " If this kid had had any idea of what her shoplifting impulse could lead to , she would n't have done it in a million years . " As the result of cases such as this , several communities have instituted educational campaigns to acquaint the teen-age thrill thieves with the possible consequences of their acts  --  before they commit them . The most successful program to date has been in Champaign , Ill . It was started in May . 1967 , by David 0 . Webb , general manager of Robeson 's Department Store , the largest in town . " I had to do something , " Robeson says . " The teen-age shoplifters were costing us fifty thousand dollars a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read a trade-paper item about a pamphlet called Teen-Agers Beware : Shoplifting Is a Crime . He sent for the brochure and read , fascinated , how " harmless shoplifting pranks " ruined the lives of teen-agers who did n't realize that stealing for kicks earned them permanent criminal records . The pamphlet went on to spell out for teenagers how one boy was denied entrance to Annapolis because a military security check revealed his conviction for stealing three cases of soda pop , and how " with a police record it can be difficult , in some cases impossible , to go into any business or profession where a special license is required , such as law or real-estate brokerage . " Robeson assembled a committee of businessmen and educators , and they re-wrote the pamphlet to conform with Illinois law and their local situation . The committee agreed to print 12,500 copies of the pamphlet and to distribute it to every high-school and junior-high-school student in town . Distribution day was last October 17. and it was accompanied by a widespread publicity campaign in the local newspapers and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Our hope was that the kids would take the pamphlets home for their parents to see  --  and they did . Adults and teenagers came up to me and said , * I never knew it was like this . ' For the first time many of our merchants got tough about prosecuting teen-age shoplifters . " The Champaign program worked  --  and is continuing to work . Lt. Delmar Dawkins of the juvenile division of the Champaign Police Department told me , " It 's hard to believe what 's happened . Before the campaign . in an average week we could always count on seven to ten cases . Now it 's down to only two or three cases a week  --  and it 's holding there . In all , juvenile shoplifting has declined seventy-five percent . Until October , shoplifting was running neck and neck with vandalism as our Number One juvenile crime . Now it 's fallen far behind both vandalism and curfew violations . " Until now . " Lt. Dawkins said , " it 's always been a hushed-up subject  --  like sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ?
