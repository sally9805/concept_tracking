txt It will never be possible for this generation to forget what happened at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7 , 1941 . We have to.recall the proud ships reeling in the smoke and their torn and drowning crews struck down by a treacherous attack , organized and directed while peace negotiations with Japan were going on in Washington . On that Sunday morning twenty years ago as the first shock waves spread over America , it would have been hard for us to believe in the future that is now the present . It would have been hard for us to believe that those who were our enemies on both sides of the world in December , 1941 , are now our friends . But so it is . The dead sailors who still lie at the bottom of Pearl Harbor , the men who died at Tarawa and other contested fields , those who died in the Normandy landing and in the defense of what used to be called Stalingrad  --  all these were the victims of history and all were in some way the defenders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little by new hates . On this day of memories there is no value in resentments against whole peoples . What we should hate , to paraphrase President Roosevelt 's famous remark , is hate itself , as the wreaths are thrown into the sea at Pearl Harbor or placed on tombs of fighting men the world over . A Policy for the Congo ( cont 'd . ) The Congo , already the scene of deep tragedy and primitive savagery , has now exploded in another open battle between the land and air forces of the United Nations and those of secessionist Katanga . In this battle the United Nations forces are entitled to the support of all nations standing for law and order ; and it is natural and proper for the United States to give them both moral and material backing for strictly limited objectives . The intervention in the Congo has been the most ambitious and in part the most beneficial enterprise the United Nations has undertaken since the Korean war . It has saved the Congo from Communist domination and thereby averted . a greater conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has helped establish a respectable central Government ( Adoula 's ) on the basis of parliamentary rule . It has provided essential first aid that has kept the country going and rescued parts of it from starvation . But if the present course of events is permitted to continue the Congo can only relapse into anarchy and the United Nations might be confronted with-a debacle that could wreck it as an instrument for the enforcement of peace . The primary responsibility for this state of affairs rests in the main on Congolese leaders themselves , in particular on secessionist President Tshombe of Katanga and semi-insurrectionist Deputy Premier Gizenga of Stanleyville . The Congo can exist and prosper only in unity . They are tearing it apart . How far other powers stand behind them and must share the responsibility is still to be determined . But the United Nations , having gone into the Congo , has likewise assumed the responsibility of bringing its mission to a successful conclusion . Unfortunately this mission has been beclouded by innumerable and often contradictory resolutions which have not only failed to provide a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exceed its original purposes and its military capacity . It should therefore be the first task of the United Nations to clarify its aims  --  preferably by a public statement . These aims can not include the conquest and subjugation of either the Congo or Katanga . The United Nations troops were sent into the Congo , in conformity with the Charter , to safeguard international peace and security by restoring law and order , preventing civil war and obtaining the evacuation of interfering foreign military personnel . Except for purposes of selfdefense , their use of force was limited to these objectives : They were specifically instructed to strive for solutions by " genuine conciliation " without which the resolutions prophetically foresaw only new conflict . That , it seems to us , is still the only basis on which the United Nations can act once order has been restored by seizure of the necessary key points in Katanga . This means , first of all , strengthening the central Government of President Kasavubu and Premier Adoula . It means bringing the Congolese leaders together for " genuine conciliation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Congolese federation that gives the widely differing provinces , including Katanga , substantial autonomy . Despite his many contradictions , President Tshombe himself has professed his willingness to rejoin the Congo on these terms . A successful outcome of the present battle should induce him to make good on this promise . It is the only basis on which the Congo can look forward to a peaceful future free of unwanted foreign interference . The McComb Incident We believe that the rowdies in McComb , Miss. , who have been , attacking Freedom Riders and beating up newspaper and magazine reporters and photographers , are waifs and strays from the true Southern spirit . We are sure that the man who assaulted John 0 . Emmerich , 61-yearold editor of The McComb Enterprise-Journal , came out of a jungle that has nothing to do with Southern civilization . Mr. Emmerich is a moderate man , tolerant of those who disagree with him , eager to improve social and economic conditions , but also a states ' righter and a born conservative  --  who has aroused the enmity of the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ecause a Federal court order had been issued implementing an Interstate Commerce Commission ruling against segregation in rail and bus terminals . A Federal district judge has now laid a temporary injunction on efforts of the Congress of Racial Equality to test this ruling . But if such men as John Oliver Emmerich stand by their principles as he did , the law eventually will be respected , and the cause of equal rights will go peaceably forward . Kennedy at the N. A. M. The dramatic implications for the United States and the free world of the Administration 's program to expand trade through a more flexible tariff policy were set forth with clarity in President Kennedy 's address yesterday to the National Association of Manufacturers . The President stressed that boldness in grasping the trade opportunities presented by the European Common Market could contribute as substantially to strengthening the West 's economic power as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had to its military power . The alternative , as Mr. Kennedy made plain , would be to slump into an economic isolation that would strip us of political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects of the speech was the sense of urgency it conveyed . Gone apparently is the President 's own indecision about whether he should risk a fight with the politically well-entrenched forces of protectionism in a national election year . He told the industrialists that this country could not afford to use time as a couch but must move swiftly to put itself in position to compete effectively in the fast-expanding world market . The President took pains to ease the disquiet many business men feel about his Administration . He renewed his assurances that he intends to submit a balanced budget next year and he promised that no action would be taken toward imposing exchange controls , devaluing the dollar or throttling economic recovery . He emphasized , too , that he expected labor as well as industry to exercise self-discipline in the interest of price stability . Mr. Kennedy will carry the same message today to the A. F. L.-C . L 0 . convention in Florida . At that time he will also disclose his specific recommendations to cushion the adverse impact of liberalized trade on the sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to a good start in seeking to mobilize national support for a program vital to America 's welfare . The cause of freedom will be well served if there is no flagging along the way . Perils of Pauline , TV Version Negotiations for the sale of WNTA-TV have resembled the Perils of Pauline . Now , true to form , Channel 13 has been saved at the last minute for educational television in the metropolitan area . With the acquisition of WNTA-TV for $6,200 , - 000 , educational television faces an exacting test and a rare opportunity . For all practical purposes Channel 13 is destined to become the standard-bearer for educational TV . Its success or failure will be a matter of national importance . The public-spirited purchasers of the station , led by Howard C. Sheperd and Devereux C. Josephs , can count on the encouragement and support of metropolitan viewers  --  and Governor Meyner has his assurance that New Jersey 's interests will be protected . The educational group 's refusal to be stopped by the difficulties in acquiring WNTA-TV augurs well for the success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Transit ' Surplus ' Since the Wagner administration and the New York City Transit Authority regard maintenance of the 15-cent fare fiction as a major accomplishment , let us examine how this is achieved . The Transit Authority 's annual report for the fiscal year ended June 30 , 1961 , shows that the city taxpayer supplied $10,822,460 to subsidize reduced-fare rides for school children ; $7,180,000 for policing the transit system , and $5,000,000 as an offset against electric power costs . These burdens were previously carried by the Transit Authority , until it became certain that operating deficits would result unless the city stepped in . But these are not the largest city - subsidies . During the fiscal year the city paid all debt service ( amortization and interest ) on transit , and this was $96,221,127 , making the total subsidy furnished by the taxpayer $119,223,587 . This is the way the Transit Authority managed to report with pride that it closed its fiscal year with a " surplus " of $2,147,000 , making an accumulated " surplus " of $25,662,243 since June , 1953 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael J. Quill would like to take over , in contract negotiations now ander way . But even without the increased labor costs that will surely come in a new contract with the Transport Workers Union , effective New Year 's Day , the authority estimates that it will have an operating deficit of $6,218,385 in the current fiscal year as contrasted with its $2,147,000 surplus last year . A current four-month deficit of over $5,000,000 is not reassuring . So , even at present wage rates , the authority is violating the principle wisely established in state law that operating costs and revenues shall break even . The city has now reached the end of the road on legitimate subsidies to transit . The ice of solvency is now very thin with the 15-cent fare . It is hard to see where the " potload of money " that Mr. Quill wants is to come from . A drastic modification of Quill demands might permit the Transit Authority to worry through a few months more on the 15-cent fare , but the private lines are really up against it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One company alone , Fifth Avenue Coach with its Surface Transit subsidiary , is paying an estimated $3,486,531 in city , state and Federal taxes this year . Unless Mayor Wagner is to embark on a new largesse of taxpayer subsidy  --  camouflaged by some strange device to stay within the law  --  a higher fare is the solution .
