The tiny Republic of Israel was rocked last week by the most sensational political row in its twelve-year history . But Israelis themselves could not be sure what the row was about-or even which side was winning , because the army , on orders from Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion himself , was censoring all reports about it . Day after day newspapers appeared with great chunks of white space where censors applied scissors . Officers were identified in print only by the initials of their last names . But no one could conceal the fact that a deadly power struggle had been joined , with Ben-Gurion , 74 , and his favored young Cabinet ministers on one side , and on the other , the so-called " Old Zionist " elders grouped around silver-haired Pinhas Lavon , 56 , secretary of the powerful Histadrut trade-union federation . Quite as obviously , the fight involved high secrets of the past as well as high offices of the future . <P> Road to Power . Poland-born Pinhas Lavon was Israel 's Minister of Defense and touted as likely prime-ministerial material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ever since , he has insisted that the charges brought against him were false , but his claims were ignored . Then last August a government official , brought to court for misconduct in another matter , unexpectedly volunteered that " on orders from above , " he perjured himself and forged the evidence on which Lavon was compelled to resign five years ago . <P> In the storm that followed , a special judicial commission delivered a secret report that is said to clear Lavon . Newspapers have managed to hint that Lavon 's relations with young Army Chief Moshe Dayan and Shimon Peres , the whip-smart young director-general of the Defense Ministry , were terrible at the time . But Peres . 37 , now B-G 's Deputy Defense Minister , denies that he had any part in framing Lavon , and Dayan , 45 , now Agriculture Minister and B-G 's present favorite for the succession , has said nothing at all . <P> Road to War . Through all the fog of censorship and intrigue obscuring the Lavon affair , the one clear fact was that Lavon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ' retirement in the Negev to take Lavon 's post . Shortly afterward , Ben-Gurion became Prime Minister , replacing Moderate Moshe Sharett , who was more susceptible to the argument that Israel must try to quiet the fears of its Arab neighbors if it is to live in peace with them . Eleven days after Ben-Gurion 's return , the Israeli army carried out the massive reprisal raid on Gaza in which Israelis blew up the Egyptian headquarters and killed 38 Egyptians . <P> Egypt 's President Nasser has often pointed to this blow as the event which convinced him that only if he sought arms , and quickly , could he save Egypt . Failing to get them in the West , Nasser turned to make the cotton-for-guns deal with the Russians that brought Communist influence into the Middle East . As more Israeli raids followed , young Shimon Peres flew to Paris to negotiate the alliance that armed Israel with French jets and tanks and paved the way for the Anglo-French-Israeli invasion of Egypt in the fall of 1956 . <P> Whatever the motivations behind it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious or uncurious coincidence , at the turning point in Middle Eastern history of the past decade .
