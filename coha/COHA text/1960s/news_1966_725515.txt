txt Mountains of United States military equipment become excess or surplus and are either given away or sold for a few cents on the dollar . Will this become Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara 's financial Achilles heel ? A Senate foreign-aid subcommittee , after months of scouting in the Far East and Western Europe , now puts its facts on the line in an opening round of hearings here . Reacting vigorously to the hearing , the Defense Department said it does n't want American men to " fight with junk " but with " the very best equipment and plenty of it . " Mr. McNamara 's staff told the subcommittee that the armed forces have an inventory of materiel worth $122 billion and to keep it up to date they must dispose of $4.6 billion worth of obsolete and outworn equipment each year . Tools unused Item . Jeeps , thousands of them , have been jammed into Asian warehouses as no longer needed and are given to the Agency for International Development ( AID ) . After being repaired they become gifts to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in South Vietnam . Item . AID was given $40 million worth of Army excess and surplus materiel in Korea ( 1965.66 budget year ) , including hundreds of trucks and trailers . Item . Hand tools , brand new and worth $30,000 , were given to AID recently . Investigator Joseph Lippman holds up an unused wrench about 21/2 feet long and tagged as worth $26.21 new . It became a gift . Valuation questioned Item . A 1958 crane weighing 20 tons , used for 2,000 hours ( fairly low usage ) , costing $27,634 new , is in an American Army depot in Japan . AID can have it if they want it to be used as a small sign of American friendliness . Item . Other equipment includes cement mixers , bulldozers , tractors , fork-lift vehicles , graders , scrapers , rock-crushing plants , tank trailers ( one tank included 5,000 gallons of high-octane gasoline left behind by mistake ) , and thousands of spare parts . If AID decides not to accept the equip- ment and repair it , which is done on a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " almost nothing . " Of course the Defense Department will have its day in court , rebutting the facts offered by the staff of a subcommittee headed by Alaska Sen. Ernest Gruening ( D ) . So far , the Senator feels the value of thousands of items is " deliberately falsified " downward to eliminate them from Army inventories . He calls it a picture of " confusion . " Repair called feasible " This is a very shocking story , " said the Senator after the two-hour hearing . When told about the hand-tool distribution in Europe , the Senator said : " Well , this must have been one of the most colossal giveaways in history . " " It 's a fraud on the American people , it 's a fraud on the taxpayer , it 's a fraud on our boys in Vietnam who need this equipment , " said the Senator , who is a steady critic of American involvement in Vietnam . Singling out the Vietnam war , staff direc- for Lippman says " The very same items which our military services have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at overseas depots as excess are the items which are in critically short supply in Vietna m . " The staff director , after his investigation , is convinced that large quantities of equipment are classified " uneconomically repairable " when actually it could be repaired " at nominal cost . " He charges that " a planned and systematic overstatement of repair costs " exists and that this policy exists not only overseas but within the United States . After his investigation , Mr. Lippman feels that " hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent unnecessarily to replace equipment which had many years of useful life remaining . " He points out that the General Accounting Office singled out this policy of equipment disposal for criticism in 1962 and 1963 . Corrective action was promised but he says " nothing has really changed . "
