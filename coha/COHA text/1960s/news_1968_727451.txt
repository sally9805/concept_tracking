txt Democrats who had been hoping to realize a modest political profit from the bombing halt in North Vietnam began wondering today whether the ensuing international controversy might not instead cost them votes next Tuesday . The refusal of South Vietnam to participate in the Paris talks on the war announced by President Johnson two days ago raised the possibility among politicians of both parties that the apparent breakthrough toward peace might backfire and hurt , rather than help , Vice President Humphrey 's closing drive for the Presidency . Thinly veiled Republican suggestions that the President 's announcement on Thursday had been motivated by a desire to influence the election moved a step closer to open charges today as Richard M. Nixon , the party 's Presidential nominee , campaigned through Texas . Assurances Reported In Austin , a Nixon aide told United Press International that the President assured the candidate two days ago that all parties to the expanded Paris talks were in agreement before the public announcement of the bombing halt was made . As a result of the new developments , the Republican adviser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation in Vietnam would be jeopardized and , further , would cast doubt on President Johnson 's " credibility in stopping the bombing . Mr. Nixon had confined his original reaction to the President 's announcement to an expression of hope that the move would bring some progress in the Paris talks . He said that he and his running mate , Gov . Spiro T. Agnew of Maryland , would not say anything more lest they endanger improved prospects for peace . In New York City , the Nixon headquarters made public the results of a telephone survey of 300 persons selected at random in nine major industrial states . It demonstrated , the Republicans said , " no appreciable shift in voting preference as a result of the bombing halt . " The telephone survey was // conducted yesterday by trained interviewers of the Opinion Research Corporation of Princeton , N. J. , a private polling organization that has worked throughout the campaign for the Nixon-Agnew ticket . Those interviewed were residents of New York , California , New Jersey . Pennsylvania , Ohio , Illinois , Michigan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the announcement of the bombing halt caused you to change your mind about who you will vote for , or are you still planning to vote for the same candidate ? " . According to the Nixon campaign headquarters , 98 per cent of those questioned said the President 's move would not affect their votes . The only benefit to Mr. Humphrey , the survey said , was a shift of 0.5 per cent from undecided to the Democratic ticket . Democrats Concerne Democrats here were concerned that Saigon 's decision to boycott the Paris meeting next Wednesday would reinforce , fairly or unfairly , a Republican contention that the President had moved prematurely in order to get new peacemaking machinery into motion before Election tDay . As a t political matter , it seemed'unlikely that renewed diplomatic efforts to bring South Vietnam back into the picture could be effective in time to present , a , fiCture of **27;513;TOOLONG for the voters next Tuesday . When Mr. Humphrey proposed a bombing halt in a televised speech on Sept 30 , Mr. Nixon responded with criticism that his Democratic opponent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " into the Paris talks . Now , Democratic strategists feared , Mr. Nixon might feel free to broaden still further his attack on the Humphrey position on the ground that a bombing halt was failing to achieve precisely the results the Democratic nominee had claimed for it . Democrats Are Cautious Even before the South Vietnamese boycott further compicated the domestic political picture , Democratic leaders across the nation were cautious in their contentions that the bombing halt would have a positive effect on their election prospects . A spot check of officials of both parties made by The New York Times indicated general agreement that the . new Johnson move would have only a moderate effect on the result next Tuesday , in part because of the lack of time before the election . Republicans who were interviewed before the Saigon snag expressed private concern that the bombing halt would introduce a new element of uncertainty into an already complex election . But they did not feel the political Impact would be serious for Mr. Nixon . One West Coast Republican ' leader even maintained that Mr. Nixon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have contributed more to Hanoi 's willingness to negotiate than anything Vice ' President Humphrey said in the campaign . ' Several Democrats , speaking on the assumption that the bombing halt would produce full participation in Paris talks , said that the announcement had come too late to have real political impact . " There is n't enough time for much effect , " a Texas party leader observed . " I think we would have needed 10 days or more to get a real peace reaction . Instead , there 's only time for people to wonder if it 's not just a political maneuver by the President . " The possibility that the bombing halt would win back Democrats . who supported Sena-1 tor Eugene J. McCarthy for the Presidential nomination appeared more real in some states than in others . A California Democratic leader predicted that such gains would be substantial there , but a Pennsylvania party official said , " We had that situation pretty well under control anyway .
