COMBAT reporting is never a safe or simple job . But even for case-hardened veterans , the Nigerian civil war presents one of the meanest assignments yet . Merely getting in and out of Biafra is a dangerous and doubtful proposition . The irregular airlift from Lisbon flies through Nigerian antiaircraft fire to reach a makeshift airstrip that is only open at night . When correspondents finally manage to get in , they are shuttled off to quarters in the Progress Hotel in Aba , the country 's provisional capital . When they are not in the field , they face the hazards of the Progress menu . This consists of yams-fried for breakfast , boiled for lunch , baked for dinner . <P> For TIME Correspondent James Wilde , a veteran of Algeria and Viet Nam , and for Photographer Priya Ramrakha , such hardships are hardly unusual . On and off , they spent four days with a Biafran commando unit behind enemy lines , crawled through the brush with a Biafran sergeant on a reconnaissance mission , joined white mercenaries leading a dangerous ambush . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw happening to Biafra and its people . " A chaplain travels from village to village administering last rites to the dying and blessing the heaps of the already dead , " wrote Wilde . " Vultures screech in the brooding , muggy sky . The air is fetid with despair and death . Reporting this story is depressing beyond description . " <P> Covering the federal side of the conflict was rarely more pleasant for Paris Correspondent Friedel Ungeheuer . But as TIME 'S former West Af rica correspondent , Ungeheuer was fortunate to find some old beerdrinking buddies among customs officials at Lagos airport to help him past the red tape and get him on a flight to Enugu , former capital of the Eastern Region , for an eyewitness report of relief operations . also had valuable background files from TIME 'S Nairobi Bureau Chief Edwin Reingold and Ottawa Bureau Chief Alan Grossman . During two years in West Africa , Grossman covered the Ibo massacres that led to the present civil war . Among his more vivid memories , Grossman recalled walking along the platform at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose to dull the lingering stench of more than a hundred Ibo corpses . " For him , too , it was all a depressing experience . <P> Artist Jacob Lawrence , who is making his first appearance on a TIME cover , has been the recipient of a long list of honors since his apprentice days at the Harlem Art Workshop in the 1930s . His paintings now hang in many of the world 's major museums . His cover painting reflects the observations of eight months ' of living and traveling in Nigeria in 1964 . Of the war , he says : " After talking to Nigerians from the east and west , we were not surprised when the conflict broke out . "
