It was May Day again , the equivalent in the Communist world of Christmas and Easter combined . As usual , the Kremlin 's rulers watched a convoy of rockets and tanks roll through Moscow 's Red Square in the annual parade . In Peking , Mao Tse-tung strode briefly onto a balcony before half a million Chinese assembled for fireworks and singing . In Hanoi , Ho Chi Minh also showed up at the festivities , accepting a bouquet of flowers from a small girl . Everywhere , also as usual , Communists displayed portraits of and ritually quoted the man who started it all , Karl Marx . This week is the 150th anniversary of Marx 's birth , and it is just as well that he is not around to see what has happened to his ideas in the lands that pay them lip service . <P> Tiny Elite . Marx felt that the proletariat could win victory only through unity , yet world Communism today is more fragmented than ever before in its history . His disciples are so antagonistic , so split over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attend a worldwide convention in Moscow later this year . In Eastern Europe , such Communist nations as Czechoslovakia and Rumania are exhibiting an independence that almost amounts to a secession from the Communist fold . China and Russia vilify each other in terms as harsh as either uses against the capitalist world . <P> Marx foresaw a classless society under Communism and predicted that the state would wither away ; but Communism seems to have produced just the opposite . Russia , China and most of the other Communist nations are run by a tiny elite that hold stronger sway over workers than Marx 's capitalist villains ever did . Far from disassembling government , the revolution 's rulers , whom Marx called a temporary " dictatorship of the Proletariat , " have strengthened it into an instrument that , were Marx living under it , would subject his own writing to censorship . <P> After Communism 's failure to reconstruct the social order , perhaps the most grievous failure of Marx 's teachings has been in economics , upon which Marxism as an operating system must succeed or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Polish Marxist <P> Philosopher Josef Zawadzki , putting it mildly , " have not left all the theses developed in that book incontestable . " In Russia , Poland , Czechoslovakia , Rumania and Yugoslavia , Marxism has been abandoned for economic reforms that borrow their mam tenets from capitalism . The revisions , grouped together in Russia under the term Libermanism , permit everything from market pricing of some consumer goods to incentive bonuses in factory piecework and decentralized planning-all untouchable in Marxist dogma . One result is a resurgence under Communism of Marx 's despised petty bourgeoisie.
