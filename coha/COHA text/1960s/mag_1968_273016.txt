Tiny Daniels , Md. ( pop . 381 ) , is one of the last examples of that almost vanished bit of Americana , the company town , which once ranged from Western mine and lumber settlements to Southern cotton camps . Somehow , Daniels , nestled in a wooded hollow along a back road eleven miles west of Baltimore , has managed to survive . Its company store , company houses , company-dominated churches and company mill-its raison d ' tre-all remained intact in the age of the megalopolis . <P> Intact , that is , until last month , when the C. R. Daniels textile company , which wholly owns the 128-year-old community , started demolishing it in line with a decision made last year that it was too expensive to maintain . The $15-million-a-year mill operation will be unaffected by the policy , since most of those losing their homes are too set in their ways-or too old-to look for new jobs . A good number of the 94 displaced families , accustomed to living in their own homes at $16-a-month rent , may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably justifiable on economic grounds , the death of Daniels creates a sad and unusual social problem that has prompted several groups to try , unsuccessfully , to save it . Some large families and retired couples will undoubtedly wind up on food stamps and welfare . Oliver Overington , 74 , retired from the mill in 1960 and lives with his wife on a company pension of $6.25 a month and $1,800 a year in social security . Though their Daniels house had minimal facilities ( no hot running water ) , the Overingtons had taken pains with the painting and papering and were convinced that they would live there the rest of their lives . Last week they moved to a $75-a-month apartment which they can ill-afford . <P> At the other end of town lives Richard Landacre , 62 , with his wife and grandchild . He makes $1.60 an hour at the mill , spends much of his leisure time working in his large vegetable garden . " We 're both sickly , " says Mrs. Landacre . " He takes nine kinds of medicine and me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess we 'll just find a room , " she says resignedly , " and sit there . "
