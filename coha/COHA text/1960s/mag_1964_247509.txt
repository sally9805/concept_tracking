" Compared with corruption , Communist infiltration in Brazil has been insignificant , " said Marshal Taurino Rezende , chairman of the revolutionary government 's Central Investigating Committee . Brazilians could put it another way : compared with corruption , practically everything in Brazil has been insignificant . When the new government of President Humberto Castello Branco had completed its housecleaning with a tenth and final political " blacklist " of prominent Brazilians accused of Communism or corruption prior to the overthrow of President Joao ( " Jango " ) Goulart , corruption indeed seemed to have first rank . <P> Peddlers " &; Sin Czars . In Goulart 's own official household , his presidential press secretary , Raul Ryff , 52 , doubled - but in name only-as $6,000-a-year treasurer of one of Brazil 's many social security institutes ; his real sideline , according to the investigators , was peddling influence , and he picked up $25,000 on one coffee deal alone . A second member of Goulart 's staff , his private secretary , added $15,000 to his regular $8,400 salary when Goulart named him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his nearest approach to the job was an all-expense seven-day blast in Rome , celebrating the appointment . Still a third close Goulart friend , the president of the General Labor Command , was able to guarantee anyone a good government job-for a $1,200 fee . <P> In Brazil 's Congress , the investigators found that one of Goulart 's Labor Party Deputies had made a fortune by adding 1,295 people to his personal payroll in return for a slice of their paychecks . A fellow congressman , one Tenorio Cavalcanti , 58 , required almost no investigation : he was already well known as a fulltime gangster ( 13 killings to his credit ) and the sin czar who-fully protected by his congressional immunity - built Duque de Caxias , on Rio 's northern outskirts , into a wide-open vice mecca famed for its brothels , gambling dens , brawling street fights and general folderol . <P> Smugglers &; Taxidermists . On and on it went , from state Governors down to civil servants . The Governor of Amazonas state was found to have staked out a huge ranch along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and warehouse , and used it to run up a whirlwind trade in smuggled goods . Another former state Governor coolly pocketed an entire $6,400,000 highway appropriation , once appointed 600 men to the single post of state taxidermist-enough to stuff every man , woman and child in his state . Then there was the former president of Brazil 's state savings banks , who became a millionaire by dipping into the till . His mistake was once inviting General Artur da Costa e Silva to visit his sumptuous apartment , showing off his wardrobe ( " Fifty white linen suits alone , " he beamed ) . Came the revolution , and Costa e Silva , now Brazil 's hardheaded War Minister , personally entered the banker 's name on the purge list . <P> In the ten blacklists , 378 Brazilians have been purged of their political rights for ten years , meaning that they can not hold public office or even vote as ordinary citizens . At that , the list was not as long as expected . But as Marshal Rezende said : " If everything wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much left . "
