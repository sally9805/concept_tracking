It is time for the TV commercial . Two people appear , standing casually in their kitchen , drinking coffee and making talk so small that it might as well be inaudible . The dialogue does n't matter , however . The two people are Lauren Bacall and Jason Robards Jr . The coffee is Instant Maxwell House . And those are the elements that Maxwell House wants you to notice . In gratitude , Maxwell House has paid Mr. and Mrs. Robards $200,000 for the two days of work involved . <P> Other stars , hearing this , scarcely look up . They are too busy making their own commercials . In the olden days-that is , in the earlier 1950s-the idea of an established star 's barking on TV for a commercial product was unthinkable . Now Barbara Stanwyck , Mr. and Mrs. Robert Taylor , Claudette Colbert and Edward G. Robinson all appear for Maxwell House , too-but only for $50,000 apiece . You can hear Robinson clearly enough , as he looks toughly over the brew and snarls , " Now do it my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season actors of all degrees of importance were paid $30 million for doing commercials . For actually acting on TV , the mass of actors earned $26 million . Movies paid them $20 million . For one 60-second commercial , an actor can make as much money as most starring players do in about 13 weeks of a TV series . <P> The payments come in all sorts of packages . Thunderbird Wine gives a new Ford Thunderbird or the cash equivalent for doing one 20-second spot . Cesar Romero and Alexis Smith quickly snatched for Thunderbirds . Joanne Dru and Sebastian Cabot took the cash . James Mason agreed to plug the wine , but apparently felt that he was not in the Thunderbird class , demanded and got a Rolls-Royce instead . Now Sir Laurence Olivier is all but lined up . He wants not one but two Rolls-Royces , and for his 20 seconds of classical bouquet , he will probably get them . <P> Allan Sherman ( My Son the Folksinger ) did a 60-second job for Brillo and was paid $60,000 plus 3,000 Brillo pads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trumpet and demonstrated that its blasts would not break the tissue . That was worth $30,000 to him . Now , when he comes onstage in his nightclub appearances , people wave Kleenex at him . Or perhaps Doeskin . <P> Pearl Bailey makes a scrupulously honest presentation of Rainier Ale . " I 've been drinking Rainier Ale for as long as I can remember , " she sings , and it is a true note , a blue note , for she adds , " which is the day before yesterday . " Rosemary Clooney recently sprayed Florient here and there and sang somewhat unconvincingly about its capacity to deodorize an entire dwelling . Beautiful Arlene Dahl was paid $80,000-not nearly enough-to do a commercial in which she is cast as a beauty consultant to the Toni Co. ; but with Arlene Dahl on the screen , how can anyone care which twin is which ? <P> Mother Image . Buster Keaton does a funny sort of Keystone Kops scene to illustrate the virtues of Ford Econoline vans , the boxy-looking , eight-door vehides that closely resemble Volkswagen Micro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and out of a whole lot full of Ford buslets , finding pies in one and hurling them into the cops ' faces while nickelodeon music plays and oldtime titles point out things like " easy loading and unloading " and " fast getaway .
