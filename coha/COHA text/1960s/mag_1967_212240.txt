MEMOIRS : 1925-1950 by George F. Kennan. 583 pages . Atlantic-Little , Brown . $10 . <P> To many Americans under 30 , the cold war seems like a scare story concocted by the older generation . But it was all too real , and no one knows it better than George Kennan . He also knows that the issues underlying the conflict have not disappeared , despite the fact that the Communist monolith has splintered into a " Humpty Dumpty " that " will not and can not be reassembled . " For the U.S. , the continuing problem is how to face Communism without being either fatuously optimistic about coexistence or excessively belligerent in opposition . In dealing with that problem , Kennan has often been out of step with his superiors at the State Department . By hindsight , it is evident that he was right more often than wrong . <P> In this dry , dispassionate account , Kennan , now a member of Princeton 's Institute for Advanced Studies , makes clear the irony of his career : he was in official disfavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then for being " too soft . " He was burned in effigy by Communist-led mobs in Rio de Janeiro during a Latin American tour in 1950 , and burned figuratively by right-wing critics in the U.S. during the decade that followed . <P> Containment by " X. " Few diplomats have ever drawn on so rich a background in international affairs . From the time he joined the Foreign Service , after graduating from Princeton in 1925 , Kennan shuttled from one sensitive crisis point to another . In 1933 , he helped reopen the American embassy in Moscow , stayed on through the savage purges that soon followed and thus received , as he writes , " a liberal education in the horrors of Stalinism . " He arrived in Prague on Sept. 29 , 1938 , the day of the Munich Conference . He was in Berlin from 1939 until Pearl Harbor , when the Nazis interned him and 130 other Americans for 51 dreary months near Frankfurt . ( After his release , Kennan recalls sarcastically , he was told that " none of us were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : we had not , you see , been working . " ) He returned to Moscow in 1944 , just when Stalin was rolling up his sleeves and getting ready to take over Eastern Europe . He arrived in Washington in time to outline the policy of " containment " against an expansionist Russia in the famous 1947 Foreign Affairs article signed " X. " <P> Unlike many U.S. liberals , Kennan never went through a Marxist phase . Before and during World War II , Franklin D. Roosevelt wanted an accommodation with Moscow , but Kennan remained in opposition until the " movement of the pendulum of official thinking from left to right would bring U.S. policy close to my own outlook in the years 1946 to 1948 , only to carry it away once more in the other direction , with the oversimplified and highly militarized view of the Russian problem that came to prevail after 1949.
