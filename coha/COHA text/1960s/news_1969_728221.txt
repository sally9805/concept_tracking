txt Houston , Nov. 20 Thursday Apollo 12 Astronauts Charles Pete Conrad and Alan L. . Bean were safely back in their lunar landing craft early today after turning their second moon walk into a lighthearted , mile-long tour of the lunar landscape and making man 's first descent into a crater on the moon . They were hack in the landing craft at approximately 1:45 a. m . Chicago time and immediately began preparing for lift-off from the surface of the moon scheduled for 8:23 a. m. after spending 311/2 hours on the moon . As Conrad stepped off the lunar dsurface , he said : " Up the ladder I come . Hi-ho , hi-ho , " He had been on the surface 3 hours 50 minutes on his second moon ' walk , and Bean had been RETURN TO THE MOON See the ' Editorial Page 1AP Wirenhoto Drawing Artist 's conception shows Astronauts Charles Conrad and Alan Bean walking away from lunar ' nodule , Intrepid , to site where the unmanned Surveyor 3 landed more than 2 years ago on bank of -a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them back to earth . on the surface with him - for 3 hours 40 minutes . Their last minutes oni the moon were spent cleaning and . brushing each other off , trying desperately to get rid of the grimy black dust and dirt that clung to everything . Later in Intrepid they used vacuum cleaners to get off what they could n't get rid of otherwise . Before ' they climbed the ladder to get back inside , Conrad proved a man 's habits are hard to change . . " That 's really ridiculous , " came Conrad 's voice from inside his space helmet . " I got- dust . all over the rock box ? and I was trying to blow it off . " Will Rejoin the Mother Ship The two are scheduled to rendezvous shortly after noon for their trip home with Astronaut . Richard F. Gordon , who has been orbiting the moon in their mother ship . The purpose of the trip to the bottom of the crater was to photograph and inspect the unmanned Surveyor 3 spacecraft that has been on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ samples from it . The moon walk and tour began just seconds after 10 o'clock last night . It began ; as Conrad said : " 0 . K. , Houston , mark . I 'm on the surface . " As he waited for Bean to join him , Conrad looked about him and said that around the space-craft " the material is a very rich brown color . It reminds me of a freshly plowed field . " He added that further away " it is a very light . ash gray . " I - Will Bring Faulty Camera Back After Bean joined him , they took the impotent television camera off its tripod , stowed it in their lunar landing craft to be brought back for study to determine the exact cause of the malfunction , and began their tour . Their first stop was an area 600 feet from their spacecraft where they set out a group of scientific experiment packages , including a seismometer , in their first moon walk yesterday morning . As they approached , Conrad asked , " Can the guy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center here responded by saying , " We are watching you on the seismic data and it looks like you 're thundering right past it . " Before the two left their spacecraft , the control center had asked them to roll a rock down the side of a crater to see if the seismometer could pick up its rumbling . Rolls Rock Down Side of ( ' rater So as they went along , the astronauts were looking for a suitable size of rock to bowl down the crater . Finally , Conrad found the one he was looking for . The control center reported getting a reading On the rolling rock and asked that a second one be rolled down for comparison purposes . Then the two went on their way making a detailed documented sample of moon rocks and soil . At one point Conrad asked the control center 1ConlInued on pugs 7 , col , 51 2 Astronauts End Second Moon ' Walk ; Tour Lighthearted // if the people there wanted to know what it felt like to walk on the moon .

" And Bean , referring to the gravity on the moon being only one-sixth of that on earth , said with a chuckle that " when you lift something up in the air , it just goes straight up . " Then he looked around and said , " Man , does that LM briar module ) look small back there . " As they came up to the side of one particular crater , Conrad said : " This looks like an interesting crater  --  different . 0 , I really see some different rocks . Big ones . It looks like all the stuff has melted in the bottom of it . Itlooks like basalt . " Tells Control Center Not to Worry As they got to the edge of the crater where Surveyor 3 is resting , Conrad said , " Let 's stop and case the joint . " Noting that the contour lines on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Surveyor , Conrad said : " If you stay at this level , you ought to end up at the Surveyor  --  just follow the contour lines .. No problem at all . " Then Bean said : " Do n't worry about it Houston . I 'm 200 feet away from it . The ground is firm . I can go back up with no strain at all . " One of the concerns has been that the sides of the crater would be too steep , or the soil too loose , for a safe visit to the Surveyor . The astronauts brought a rope along so that one could help the . other out if he got into trouble . Then Conrad said to Bean , " Why do n't you mosey down there and start taking some photo-graphs ? " When they got there , Bean said : " Hey , we 've got a nice brown Surveyor here , Houston . " The spacecraft was ? white when it was launched . Collect Parts from Surveyor 3 ? ? The astronauts also noted that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spacecraft had turned black . They were blue when Surveyor'left for the moon . ? Conrad noted that " the Surveyor is firmly planted here ... that 's no trouble . " Then the astronauts began retrieving samples of aluminum , steel , plastic , and glass parts from Surveyor to bring back in order to determine what the effect of a long period in the lunar environment had been on them . One of the parts they brought back was Surveyor 's television camera . As they neared the end of the job of cutting it loose , Conrad said , " Two more cuts ... and that baby 's ours . " Then he shouted , " We 've got her , man , beautiful . " And Bean said , " It 's in the bag . " Then they started up out of the crater and headed back for their landing craft . In all , their route was about a mile long and took them as far as 1,300 feet from the landing craft . The astronauts woke up at 7:20 p. yesterday and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only five hours sleep ? since ending their first moon walk , but they appeared eager to press on with the second . Conrad described their rest period as , " short but sweet , " and said , " I 'd like to go as soon as we can without hurrying . " Their first moon walk , which began shortly before 6 a. m. yesterday and lasted almost four hours , was a success in most of its important respects . Landed Closer than Plaiihed The two astronauts landed on the moon at 12:47 a. m. yesterday with touchdown that proved that pinpoint landings can be made . ? They came even closer to the Surveyor than they had expected to . Pinpoint landings will be crucial on future Apollo lunar landings , particularly when attempts will be made to land in the moon 's highlands . Conrad was at the control of Intrepid , their landing craft , as they came down to the surface of the moon . Bean was counting off the altitude readings from the craft 's radar . Later , in view of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landing craft and became the third man ever to walk on the MOM His comment upon setting foot on the surface was in keeping with his chatter thruout the walk . Neil A.

But Conrad preferred the informal . His comment was : " Whoopie . Man , that may have been a small one for Neil , but that 's a long one for ins . " He added , ' ' Boy , you 'll never believe it . Guess what I see sitting on the side of the crater ? The old Surveyor . " Then he said with a chuckle : " Does n't that look neat . It ca n't be any further than 600 feet from here . How about that . " As he was collecting a sample of rocks so that they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had to leave the moon earlier than plamied , Conrad said : " Look , there 's one big rock .
