Lyndon Johnson last week pondered one of the most critical decisions of his presidency-and he pondered it almost entirely alone . The question was how many more U.S. fighting men will be needed for the Viet Nam war . The Joint Chiefs of Staff , civilian policymakers at the Pentagon and State Department functionaries mulled over more than half a dozen plans , probably one from General William C. West moreland , the U.S. commander in Viet Nam , calling for 206,000 troops beyond the 525,000 already authorized . But there was a feeling that the debate was being conducted in a vacuum . <P> The President has retreated into an ever-narrowing inner circle of advisers , and nobody outside that coterie knows what is on his mind , what questions he is asking or what he hopes to accomplish . According to one Cabinet member , the key men around him are newly installed Defense Secretary Clark Clifford , National Security Adviser Walt W. Rostow and Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas . Secretary of State Dean Rusk , a hawk from the first , has apparently lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observer suggests , he has developed some doubts about the war .

In both the Defense and State Departments , many sub-Cabinet-level officials flatly oppose sending as many men to Viet Nam as some of the military chiefs would like , but it is uncertain whether their objections are getting through to the President . <P> Should Johnson decide on a massive new input of men , the impact on the U.S. would be profound : mobilization of some elements of the reserves and of the National Guard at a time when both may be needed to cope with disorders in the cities ; higher taxes ; perhaps even wage and price controls . The effects on Johnson 's political future would be no less profound , for support of the war has reached an alltime low within the nation . According to a Gallup poll released this week , 49% of Americans-the highest total ever-believe that the U.S. made a mistake in sending troops to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> <P> Beyond Korea . Clearly , the Communists ' Tet offensive had much to do with the groundswell of pessimism . An unremitting stream of TV clips and still photographs-such as LIFE 'S classic shot of wounded U.S. Marines stacked aboard a tank in Hue-daily underscored the war 's horror . Since the widespread attacks began on Jan. 31 , the U.S. has lost an average of 500 men a week , pushing the overall casualty total-Americans killed in action or wounded-since the beginning of 1961 above Korean War totals. * <P> Those who object to the war have always done so for three basic reasons , and the Tet offensive helped swell the ranks . The three : <P>
