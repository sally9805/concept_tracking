THE DISNEY VERSION by Richard Schickel. 384 pages . Simon &; Schuster. $6.50 . <P> <P> Walt Disney died on Dec. 15 , 1966 , at the age of 65 ; yet it is difficult to think of him as being dead . Much of this has to do with the ubiquitous enterprises that , under Brother Roy Disney , continue to spread the name. * On a more disturbing level , however , it is difficult to accept the fact of Disney 's death because it was difficult to accept the facts of his life . Even his surname , said to have been traced to a Burgundian soldier named De Disney who followed William the Conqueror to England in 1066 , seems a fanciful invention . To his family , Disney was a genius to be pampered ; to his business associates , he was the boss to be yessed . His meticulously cultivated public image remains that of the sort of magician often hired to entertain at children 's birthday parties-a milk-and-cookies Mandrake complete with slick hair and slim mustache . <P> This fluent analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Cinema Critic Richard Schickel ruffles the image without disrupting the performance . Parents out of sympathy with Disney 's too sweet view of life will continue to take their children to his movies anyway , if only to recapture a sense of innocence in their own responses . Nostalgia is a bug not easily shooed . <P> Love-Hate . For Disney , nostalgia was an article of faith in the moral superiority of the good old days . Throughout his career , he projected " images of longing " - from the barnyard and smalltown settings for many of Mickey Mouse 's antics to the entrance of Disneyland , which compels visitors to pass through a turn-of-the-century Midwestern Main Street , " an idealized vision of Disney 's boyhood environment . " <P> Yet Disney was far more than a Br'er Babbitt who made it big cracker-barreling the virtues of hard work and good clean fun . He was , as Schickel generously illustrates , a masterful organizer , bold technological innovator and a zealous , often ruthless go-getter in the idealized American tradition . He had a compulsion to order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once described as " the world 's biggest toy lor the world 's biggest boy , " consumed most of his interest in the last years of his life . When it came to technical matters , he was a perfectionist ; he had the huge shade tree at the Tahitian Terrace pruned to better his view , and then had new branches stuck on to restore the tree 's symmetry . Yet the mermaid who drifts by during the otherwise believable submarine ride is bare-breasted but lacks nipples . <P> Schickel admits that he was interested in Disney not only as an individual but also as " a type that I have known and conducted a sort of love-hate relationship with since I was a child . " The author 's ambivalence cost him the cooperation of Disney and , after his death , of his associates . But this has not kept Schickel from presenting his subject in a firm social , cultural and artistic context . Schickel has high regard for the primitive , graphic quality of the early Mickey Mouse cartoons and for full-length , animated features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of Disney 's best-elaborate and smoothly executed without the slick , sugary glaze seen on many of the Disney animations of the late ' 50s and ' 60s.
