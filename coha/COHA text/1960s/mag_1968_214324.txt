Of all Olympic competition , the decathlon most closely reflects the original Greek ideal of all-round athletic excellence . An entire track and field meet in miniature , its ten events in two days add up to the toughest individual test of speed , stamina , strength and spirit ever devised . The man who wins the Olympic decathlon well deserves to be known as the finest athlete in the world . That man last week was William Anthony Toomey , a 29-year-old schoolteacher from Santa Barbara , Calif. , who not only captured the gold medal but set an Olympic record in the process . <P> Toomey modestly insists that " behind every good decathlon man there 's a good doctor , " and indeed the demands of the brutal competition are enough to strain the strongest body . Kurt Bendlin , West Germany 's world record holder , arrived in Mexico City complaining of two sore knees and tendonitis in one elbow . Toomey had a pulled hip muscle for which he was being treated with cortisone . Even so , in the first test , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sec. , best time of the day and good enough for 959 points under the complicated decathlon scoring system. * Then , a soaring 25-ft. 9-in. long jump , best of Toomey 's career , gave him another 994 points and kept him in the lead . After that , a poor 45-ft . Hin. shotput ( " That really depressed me " ) and a disappointing 6-ft. 4-in. high jump dropped him to second behind East Germany 's Joachim Kirst . Next came the grinding 400-meter run , and after ten straight hours of competition , Toomey somehow managed to sprint the distance in 45.6 sec . It was the fastest time ever recorded in the decathlon-only 1.8 sec. off the new world record-and it put him back in the lead as the first day ended . <P> Weary , ready for dinner and bed , Bill started to leave the field , only to find that he had one more trial to pass-the urine test . Checkups for dope are now mandatory in the Olympics , and for decathlon athletes the tests were given at the end of each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hang around the stadium drinking liquids until he could supply officials with a urine sample . <P> Down to the Last . The second day 's competition began with the 110-meter hurdles , and Bill ran it in 14.9 sec. , .3 sec. slower than his best . His discus throw , 143 ft. 31 in. , was " near what I wanted , " but the pole vault almost proved a disaster . " I just about had a heart attack when I missed the opening height on my first two attempts , " said Toomey . He pulled himself together to vault 13 ft. 91 in. , tying his personal record . A 206-ft. i-in. javelin throw kept him in first place , a bare 61 points ahead of West Germany 's Bendlin , who had moved into second with a monumental heave of 247 ft. 5 in.
