I Saw What Makes Communism Work - If this is Communism , what 's so special about it ? " The question was asked by a pleasant-faced American businessman in the lobby of the Akron Hotel in Prague , Czechoslovakia . He had been in Vienna on business , he explained , and he had decided to make a quick trip to Prague to see with his own eyes " what Com  --  munism is really like . " What he had seen had surprised him . He had had a vague mental image of underfed people being herded about by jack-booted police . Instead he had found himself in a pretty good hotel , where he could buy an excellent steak dinner with good beer for about two dollars . On the streets outside the hotel he had seen well-fed women ? too well-fed  --  and prosperous-looking men carry  --  ing briefcases . And he had seen a lot of con  --  sumer goods in the shop windows  --  tricycles , television sets , baby carriages , tasty-looking fruit in elaborate bon-voyage baskets . So what was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also had come to sec with my own eyes . I was on the third leg of an automobile trip of more than 3000 miles , which started in Berlin and ended in Trieste , and which included the six capitals of the East European Communist countries , plus dozens of smaller towns and little villages . And I , too , had been surprised . Perhaps be  --  cause there were so many surprises , the trip was the most interesting journalistic journey of 13 Belgrade : Night life at the Metropole , where members of Yugoslavia 's New Class  --  its Communist elite  --  dance to capitalist music such as rock ' n ' roll and the cha cha inquiry I have ever undertaken , and it led me to some unexpected conclusions . For example , I am quite sure now that , on balance , the Soviet Union 's vast European satellite empire is not an asset to Russia . On the contrary , the restive satellite states , with their artificially imposed and essentially fragile regimes , have a braking effect on Soviet policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not prove  --  that somehow , someday , the Soviet effort to impose a Chinese copy of the Soviet system on half of Europe will break down , al  --  though perhaps only very gradually . These rather hopeful conclusions are balanced by others which are not so hopeful . l'er example , I now believe that the greatest danger of war in Europe comes not from Berlin , where both sides arc at least in control of their situation , but from Poland , where the situation could quite conceivably become uncontrollable . But here let us consider that question the American businessman asked in the lobby of the Alcron Hotel . It was a natural question foran American to ask . On the surface , in the centers of its capital cities  --  which arc , of course , as unrepresentative of the whole coun  --  try as Fifth Avenue or the Champs tlysees  --  Communism of the Eastern European variety no longer looks very " special . " You can have Sunday lunch at a hotel in Budapest , Hungary , where there was blood on the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children with hoops , the tweedy ladies , and the gents with handlebar mus  --  taches , you can quite easily imagine yourself in some provincial English town . You can walk down the main shopping street in Bucharest , Romania , and  --  if you do not carefully examine quality and price of the merchandise  --  you will see little real differ  --  ence between Communist shop windows and shop windows elsewhere . You can go to a night club in Sofia , Bulgaria , and find that it differs in no essential way from a night club in East Dubuque , Illinois  --  except that the floor show is perhaps a mite sexier . There arc still visible differences between a free city and a Communist city , of course . Even in the big Communist cities there is so little traffic that you can always be sure of parking right in front of your hotel . In Prague and Sofia there are big red stars on the largest buildings , and they arc lit up at night  --  in Prague , though , they no longer illuminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the smaller towns of Czechoslovakia especially , you sec loud-speakers every hun  --  dred yards or so  --  Big Brother 's larynx . There are huge white-on-red signs plastered about everywhere , especially in Romania : PROLE TARIAT OF THE WORLD UNITE , or OUR FRIEND  --  SHIP WITH THE SOVIET UNION IS AS NECESSARY TO US AS THE AIR WE BREATHE . Especially in Prague you often see odd , straggly little groups of chilly boys and girls , running about carrying red flags or big Communist banners . And there is also a kind of grayness and sadness about all the Communist cities , which an American visitor immediately feels but can not quite define  --  the businessman in the lobby of the Alcron acknowledged that he felt it too . And yet his question was a natural one all the same , and it is a good question to consider at the beginning of this three-part report on the huge hunk of Europe now ruled by Russia . For despite the surface appearance of " un  --  specialness " which the big satellite cities now present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are special  --  very special indeed . When the American businessman asked his question , I thought of another conversation I had had the day before with a pretty lady . Perhaps because she was so pretty I was un  --  duly affected by what the lady said . She was , as the French say , " of a certain age , " and she had many fine lines running out from the corners of her eyes , but she was still charming , and she must once have been really beautiful . She was standing with three small , quiet , neatly dressed sons in the courtyard of one of Prague 's lovely cathedrals . I asked her in English something about the cathedral , andshe shook her head and replied in French , and a halting conversation ensued  --  her French was good , but mine is not . We chatted a bit about the architectural marvels around us , and then I took a picture of her children with my one-minute camera  --  an invaluable icebreaker and conversation starter . I gave her the picture , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she said no  --  and added something I did n't quite catch about her husband . I asked her what her hus  --  band did . She said he had been a lawyer , but that now he was a mine worker in a town about eighty kilometers away  --  and she hardly ever saw him . I asked her why , and she shrugged her shoulders and said , " The regime  --  he was of the bourgeoisie . " Her eyes filled with tears , and suddenly we were both dreadfully em  --  barrassed and we said good-by and went our ways . It was a brief encounter and , as I say , I may have been unduly affected by it . There is a difference , after all , between sending a man to work in the mines . ( Continued on Page 78 ) ( Continued from Page IS ) and sending him to die in Siberia , as Stalin might have dune , or into the gas chant-bens , as Hitler might have done . Even so . the small episode seems to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American businessman 's question . In Eastern Europe  --  except perhaps in Poland  --  the man you see in the street or at the next table in a restaurant is totally at the mercy of a regime controlled from a foreign capital and rigidly guided by an inherently cruel and irrational doctrine . Even if the man looks prosperous and well fed , even if he is a member of the " new class " of upper Communist bureau  --  crats , he is still absolutely at the regime 's mercy  --  indeed , because Communism has always fed on its own flesh , he is in greater danger than an ordinary citizen . If a man says the wrong thing to a seeming friend , if he goes to church too conspicuously , if he has inadvertently incurred the dislike of some more powerful person , or if he has a " bourgeois background , " his life may be broken by the regime as you break a match between your fingers . The pretty lady 's husband had com  --  mitted the sin of having had the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . Her own bourgeois background was written all over her , like the mark of Cain , in the way her hair was done , in the way she wore her scarf . And to be of bourgeois background is indeed to wear the mark of Cain in Eastern Europe . This curious , savage , reverse snobbery was one of the surpristes of my trip through Com  --  munist Europe . I knew in theory , of course , that in a Communist state it is dangerous to be born of middle-class parents  --  although Marx , Engels and Lenin all came from the middle class . But my only previous first  --  hand experience of Communism was a month I spent in Russia four years ago . In the Soviet Union . where the Commu  --  nist Revolution is now middle-aged , the small middle and upper classes have long since been destroyed . In Russia you do n't hear about people having a " bourgeois background , " because there are n't any left . But in Eastern Europe , where the proportion of people of bourgeois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of their destruction is still going on . Mind you , the " bourgeois " label is not confined to the old tiny class of the very rich in Eastern Europe . The industrial multimillionaires of that class were given to grossly vulgar displays of wealth , like the hideous palace built by a Czech in  --  dustrialist in the ' 20 's and now occupied by the American ambassador in Prague , with its gold faucets , its heated indoor swimming pool complete vs ' th Corinthian pillars and its woodwork stripped from old churches . As for the aristocrats , many of them never visited their estates except for an occasional shoot , preferring the pleasures of Paris or other Western flesh  --  pots . Whatever may happen in the future in Eastern Europe , such people will never again wield power there . But the Communist definition of what is " bourgeois " does not apply only to such people . It applies , at a guess , to four out of five readers of this magazine . You are bourgeois if your father had a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or if you are a reasonably successful professional man , or if you run your own haberdashery or milk route or even the local quick and dirty . You are bourgeois if you and your forebears have not always worked for others , as manual laborers , in a factory or on the land . Especially in Czechoslovakia , where the surrender to the regime has been al ? most total , there are many " bourgeois " who are loyal servants of the regime . There are even Communists of middle-class origin , I met a few , and they were , of course , the most fanatical Communists I met . But if you had the wrong back  --  ground , by Communist standards , you can never rise really high , and you arc never really trusted . Communist or not , you are always in danger of the sort of sudden and capricious punishment to which the pretty lady 's husband was subjected . While I was in Budapest , the news got about that one of the leading doctors had been deprived of his practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  tionary . It had been discovered , no doubt through some enemy or rival in Hun  --  gary 's vast network of secret-police in  --  formers , that his wife had aristocratic connections . In Prague they tell the story , said to be true , of the man who had been a success  --  ful lawyer before the Communist coup , who had since faithfully served the regime in a subordinate legal position , and who had suddenly been ordered to the mines . Weeping , he asked his superiors why he was being punished in such a way . " Your father was of the bourgeoisie , " he was coldly informed . " You know very well that he was a banker . " Indignantly the victim explained that his father was even then a trusted official in the state bank . " Oh , his case is different , " he was told . " He has been able to prove that his father was a simple workman , so of course he is all right . " In Budapest I had a long talk with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angrily insisted on the Communist line ( which is demonstrably a lie ) that the Hungarian revolt had been stimulated with outside help by " bourgeois remnants and the Horthyite reaction " ? this was why the " bourgeois remnants " had to be liquidated . I do n't think he believed this for a moment himself , for he repeated it as if by rote and with a faintly cynical air . But I suddenly touched a human chord in him when I asked how he had become a Communist . He hesitated for a moment and then replied that he was one of twenty-five survivors of a big Nazi prison camp , to which he had been sent " be  --  cause my grandfather committed the crime of being a Jew . " I replied that to persecute a human being because his grandfather was a Jcw seemed to me morally grotesque , but that it seemed just as grotesque to persecute a man because his grandfather had owned a factory . He Tit turned white with anger and replied only that the remark was too stupid to deserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely killed these days for the crime of having the wrong grandfather  --  their lives are simply broken . In most of Eastern Europe the period of killing for political reasons has largely come to an end , as in the Soviet Union itself . The exception is Hungary . A few months ago a number of boys who had fought the Russian tanks in the streets of Budapest were taken out of jail and shot , At the time of the Hungarian revolt they had been in their mid-teens , and the legal age for the death penalty is eighteen , so their trials and executions were simply delayed until they reached that age . This example of " Socialist legality " also suggests what is " so special about Communism . " There are , in fact , plenty of things that arc " special " about the countries of Eastern Europe . But they all relate in one way or another to one word . The word is " fear . " These regimes run on fear as surely as a car runs on gas . Without fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite dif  --  ferent from what we have come to regard as Communism since the Russian Revo  --  lution forty years ago . That is why , as I shall try to show later , the situation in Poland , where there is amazingly little fear , is so unstable , so dangerous , and so crucially important for the future . You do not have to look very hard or very long to find the skull of fear beneath the gray skin of Communism . You come upon it often , always unexpectedly , al  --  most always briefly , in a sudden , un  --  anticipated insight . There was the evening in Bucharest , for example , when Rowland Evans , of the New York Herald Tribune , and I were strolling along the main shop  --  ping street . We stopped in front of a store window and were peering at a display of china , when an elderly lady beside us said something to us in German , with a smile . Evans replied in English , and she shook her head and tried French  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady in Prague , she , too , had the mark of Cain upon her , in a cer  --  tain musty , faded elegance . The conversa  --  tion , which clearly gave her a strange , strong pleasure  --  many people in Eastern Europe get a curious nostalgic lift out of speaking a Western language  --  could not possibly have been more innocent . It con  --  cerned such matters as a niece who lived in Milwaukee , the weather and the popu  --  lation of Washington , D. C. I had just said that the population of Washington was less than a million , and she had re  --  plied in surprise , " rraiment , c'est tout ? " when a man in a black hat came up and E SATURDAY EVENING  |p0ST  entered the conversation in broken Eng  --  lish . She turned around and looked at him  --  he had " cop " written all over him  --  and then , while he was saying something to Evans , she put her finger to her lips in a small , frightened gesture , with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bon soir , messieurs , " and scuttled away quickly . It was , certainly , a very small episode , but it moved Evans and myself oddly . I think I shall remember for a long time the little gesture and the appeal in her eyes  --  and then the small figure scurrying off . Or there was the man in the night club . I had been wandering around a satellite city  --  I wo n't say which one  --  in a rather aimless fashion one evening , when I came unexpectedly on a night club of sorts tucked away in an alley . There were square tables packed tightly together , lots of smoke , and a strawberry-blond chan  --  teuse . I found a seat opposite a man with reddish-brown hair , a face which would have been taken in America for an Irish face , and a double-breasted suit cut as in old pictures of Herbert Hoover when he was President . For a while we silently contemplated the strawberry blonde . Then I asked him if he spoke English , and he said " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by a cataract of French  --  again there was the obvious pleasure in speaking French , which made the risk of the conversation worth it . For there was a risk , as the Irish-faced man himself made clear . At first we small-talked . He was an engineer . So I was an American ? He was much surprised  --  ex  --  cept in Poland and Czechoslovakia , Americans are very rare birds , indeed , in the satellite countries . I asked for a beer , but you can hardly ever get beer in East European night spots ? " Beer is for work  --  men , " I was told in one place  --  and we settled for a brandy apiece . It cost about fifty cents per brandy at the tourist ex  --  change rate . " Here , " the Irish-faced man suddenly burst out , " a trained engineer like myself  --  a hundred brandies a month , that is what we must live on . " He was probably poor-mouthing a bit , since an engineer gets somewhat more than the equivalent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get about double that amount . Then he went on about the misery of trying to support a family  --  he had three children  --  on such an amount . I must have looked sympathetic , for he grabbed my arm and grinned and said , " But please , laugh , be gay , do not look serious . 1 shall , of course , be questioned and I must be able to say that you were just a drunken American and that we talked about women and laughed a bit . " Then there was some more talk about the miserable standard of living , and again : " Laugh , and do not talk loudly , there are some young ones at the next table , and sometimes the young ones are the worst . " Then he asked me to come to his apartment " to see how our people really live under Communism . " There are times when a journalist must also remember that he is a human being , so 1 said that I should much like to see his apartment , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as art American , and therefore " much re  --  marked . " " But you arc truly kind , " he said . " I am thankful to you . " Some more small talk , and then , with anguished earnestness : " I beg of you , do not be  --  lieve anything the Communists tell you about this country  --  they are liars , all , all . " There was a small silence , and then he said that it would be better to part and he would contrive to see me again . I had run out of the local currency , so I pullesta dollar bill out of my pocket , to pay for my share of the brandies . He drew back as it bitten , and told me with convincing in tensity to put ( Continued on Page 80 ) 8o ( Continued from Page 78 ) the bill back in my pocket . Then he asked me to go away as though I were angry and drunk . I got up , gave a fair imitation of a drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I find that you have insulted me ! " and swayed off . The next morning I was having break  --  fast with a Communist journalist at my hotel when the man with the Irish-looking face came in the door , looked at me , saw the journalist , did a quick pantomime of a man looking for a friend and not lin ding him , and walked out . That was all . An  --  other small episode , but again the kind of episode that provides a quick glimpse of the reality behind the mask of Com  --  munism . The episode could have happened in Czechoslovakia , or Romania , or Hun  --  gary or Bulgaria . Indeed , in all those countries , 1 experienced some such quick glimpse behind the mask . But it could not have happened in Poland . Poland wears no mask . In Poland , the man would have said what he said loudly , perhaps banging on the table for emphasis . And when I brought out my dollar bill , the chances are that he would have suggested a black-market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a black-market deal . Rowland Evans and I met hun when we stopped outside a small town in southern Poland . on the way to the Czech border , to ask where we could get a meal . A stocky , aggressive , middle-aged man vol  --  unteered to take us to a restaurant , and as soon as we were seated he suggested buy  --  ing some dollars at the current black-market rate . We said we were on our way out of Poland and needed no more zlotys . He shrugged his shoulders , remarked that he already had about " two kilos " of dol  --  lars and when he had another kilo or so , he meant to escape . But why ? I asked . Surely things were better now , since Gomulka came in ? " Yes , " he said , " things are better than they were . But they will get worse again in a year or two . You Americans can not understand . Things muss get worse . This system can not work at all without terror . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system can not work without terror . Al over Eastern Europe , people can not live decently on the income from one job . They must hold two jobs , or an extra part-time job , or they must find some other way of increasing their incomes . This is as true of Poland as of the other satellite countries . The difference is that whereas elsewhere in Eastern Europe peo  --  ple almost always earn the extra income in ways that are more or less legitimate in the eyes of the regime , Poland is one vast racket . Everyone has an angle . " One hand washes the other , " the Poles say  --  their version of " you scratch my back and I 'll scratch yours . " This national back scratching is ultimately paid for , one way or another , by the state , which is one rea  --  son why Poland is in a condition of seemingly permanent economic crisis . This universal racketeering is the other side of the coin to the still almost uni  --  versal freedom of speech . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk as the Poles talk . In my first day in Warsaw I heard three versions of the old joke about the hideous Palace of Culture , a wedding-cake mon  --  strosity " presented " to Warsaw by the Russians : " The best place to see Warsaw is from the top of the Palace of Culture , because from there you ca n't see the Pal  --  ace of Culture . " There are dozens of such jokes , and they almost all contain a curious element of condescension toward both the Russians and the Communists . I asked a young Pole whether any of his friends were actual , convinced , truebelieving Communists . " There was one , " he said with a laugh , " but he is on vaca  --  tion , " Then he added seriously : " Truly , it is not at all fashionable now to be a Communist . " I was sitting next to a Polish lady in the Bristol Hotel , when a lovely Rus  --  sian fashion model came in . In my weeks in Russia I had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was breath  --  taking  --  pitch-black hair , full lips , a sug  --  gestion of the oriental about the eyes . 1 said she was beautiful , and the Polish lady subjected her to a long , appraising glance . " Yes , " she said , " she 's pretty , but trust a Russian to wear an electric-blue dress with a red handbag and beige shoes . And besides , her eyes are empty  --  they are not alive . " This odd condescension toward Rus  --  sians and Communists  --  it is really a sort of snobbery  --  is an accurate reflection of a national attitude , at least among the educated . Mind you , this sort of thing is talk  --  it is not the written word . But even today things can still be written in Poland which could not be written in the other satellites or in Russia itself ; and it is still possible , with some difficulty , to buy Western newspapers in Warsaw . But with every passing month the pressure for more conformity , for more " Socialist discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does the danger of some sort of blowup , some  --  thing unpredictable and perhaps uncon  --  trollable . For the situation in Poland is profoundly unstable  --  in the scientific meaning of that word . It is based on two marriages of convenience , in which the partners are , in the nature of things , in  --  compatible . One is the marriage between the Communist regime and the Catholic church . The other is the marriage between Communism and personal freedom . Gomulka 's promise to permit religious instruction in the schools for those who wanted it , and his promise to do away with the secret police oppression , saved Poland from the fate of Hungary in 1956 . Both promises are still being honored , in essence , as this is written . But it is hard to believe that they can go on being honored indefinitely . An independent church is inherently abhorrent to Communism , since it pro  --  vides , whether its leaders so wish or not , a rallying point and counterweight to the authority of the regime . Every Sunday the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed tight , with an overflow crowd outside in the street . Passing one such crowd , I asked a young Pole if he were religious . " 1 am not TICK religiously religious , " he replied with a smile , " but I am politically religious . " There are a lot of " politically religious " Poles who go to church as a form of pas  --  sive resistance to Communism , and the Communists are well aware that this is so . And Communism is , of course , as in  --  herently abhorrent to the Catholic Church as the Church is to Communism . In a brutal attempt to slow the dangerously rapid growth of the Polish population , the regime encourages abortions  --  there were more than 200,000 free abortions last year . The church can not but fight the abortion program , which is mass murder in the eyes of the church . And so the tension be  --  tween church and state grows steadily . The state uses its economic power to bring pressure on the church , and the church uses its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked a charming young priest in Poznan whether there was a cold war going on between church and state . " It is not a cold war , " he said , " it is war to the death . " The marriage between Communism and a measure of real personal freedom is just as unstable and inherently incompati  --  ble . The people in the other satellite states do not racketeer for the same reason that they do not speak freely  --  because they are afraid . The same secret-police appara  --  tus which drags a man off for criticizing the government also drags him off for black-marketeering , or for any other in  --  fringement of the ail-encompassing eco  --  nomic laws . Because the secret-police terror has been eliminated in Poland , the Poles are not afraid to criticize the gov  --  ernment . And they are also not afraid to black-marketeer or to rob some state enterprise blind . It is in this sense that personal free  --  dom  --  which is freedom from fear  --  is incompatible with Communism , at least the kind of Communism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revolution . For Communism demands a total monopoly of ideas and of power , and that monopoly can only be main  --  tained through the instrument of fear . That is why " this system can not live without terror . " Will Gomulka or a suc  --  cessor attempt fully to restore the terror system ? And if so , what will happen ? The answer , of course , is that nobody knows . There are certain monstrosities of the last war , and which all Poles fear because they ' feel certain that sooner or later Germany will try to grab back the territory  --  a third of // Poland  --  which was German before the war . You hear endless jokes in Poland about the Russians , but never about the Germans  --  Germany is not a joking mat  --  ter . And a great many Poles believe , or have persuaded themselves to believe , that Russia and Communism , much as they despise both , are the only bulwark against Germany . Another stabilizing factor is the mem  --  ory of Hungary . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " What happened in Hungary started in  --  side the party  --  it could n't start anywhere else  --  and we Communists saw those pic  --  tures of Hungarian Communists hung up like sides of beef . " Many Poles believe , moreover , that even if the Gomulka regime were determined to do so , it would be all but impossible to re-establish the system of police terror . Police terror re  --  quires an immense network of informers , and such a network depends in turn on a hard core of true-believing , fanatical Communists . There are , the Poles will tell you , simply no more true-believing Com  --  munists left to form the hard core . But there is , perhaps , an clement of whistling  --  in-the-dark about this theory . " If they really tried to go the whole way back , " one Pole told me , " God knows what would happen . We Poles have a habit of committing national suicide ev  --  ery twenty years , and perhaps it would come to that . " Perhaps it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , violent ( for the Poles are violent people ) and uncontrollable  --  and therefore dangerous to the peace of the world  --  is by no means to be ruled out . But attempts to peer into the future in Poland or elsewhere in Eastern Europe , are not worth a great deal . On only one point I am sure : either the Gomulka regime or some successor regime will suc  --  ceed in re-establishing fear as the chief instrument of state power ; or the Polish Communist regime will become in time inherently and basically different from the Communist regimes in Russia or the satellites , For it is quite true that the Communist system , as developed in Russia since 19 i 8 and ruthlessly imposed on half of Europe since 1945 " can not work without terror . " To abandon terror as the chief instrument of the state would mean to abandon the state 's claim to a total monopoly of ideas and of power , and a state without such a. monopoly would be essentially different from the Soviet Communist state . The gradual development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least con  --  ceivable  --  is a subject which will be ex  --  amined in a later report on the Soviet **28;1753;TOOLONG the basis of more than 3000 miles of driving through Eastern Europe , I can highly recommend that part of the world for reasonably adven  --  turous tourists  --  on one condition .
