txt According to vital The statistics , ' there are Enjoyment more people this year of Seniority than ever before who can rejoice that they are no longer young ? if they feel that way . Some have been talking in this fashion for thousands of years . It was a generation before the birth of Christ that Cicero wrote " De Senectute , " his classic on the joys of old age . It 's a line of thought that breeds suspicion . Is n't the fellow rationalizing a bit ? Cicero seems to hunt for details to show the advantages of age , but some of those he finds make little appeal to youth today . " In old age , " he boasts , " the voice actually gains that magnificent resonance which even I have not lost . " But the boast itself is lost when every politician makes his speeches into a microphone . Like all great oraA Plea tors , Cicero had a feelfor ing for his audience the Defense and he tried to give his argument a broad general appeal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the greatest states have been overthrown by the young and sustained and restored by the old . " Like the great lawyer he was , he rebutted the opposition . " But , it is alleged , the memory is impaired . I certainly never heard of any old man forgetting where he had hidden his Money ! The aged remember everything that interests them . " Perhaps the most striking thing about " De Senectute " is that it gives so much evidence that the author was conscious of opposition . He even took up the charge that old men are a bore to youth . " A pleasure rather than a bore ! " he thundered . " Nor do I feel that I am any less of a pleasure to you than you are to me . " Wherever you dip into it , the Cicero line remains essentially a summation for the defense . The moderns are Our Elders more aggressive . " Life Hoist begins at forty , " wrote a Banner Walter Pitkin . " This is the revolutionary outcome of our New Era @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the richest blessing of science . So , while fools die young , superior people learn to live late . " So many people liked that idea so much that he went further . In " The Best Years " he wrote , " I 'd rather be seventy today than a youth in any earlier age of the world . We see the years after fifty yielding more fun , more thrills , more insights , and more fresh experience than all the rest of life . . . . As soon as the whole story of World War II has been assembled , we shall find what every insider now knows , that while all the heavy dogwork had to be done by youngsters , nearly all of the decisive headwork and daring strategy came from men much nearer to seventy than to twenty , And much of the revolutionary ingenuity and intelligence and information came from men in their early seventies . " In " The Second ForOld Years , " Dr. StiegMethuselah litz gives medical supRestyled port to this idea , but he does n't find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correlation between age and ability . " A young fool will grow up to be an old fool , except he bless the community by dying early a damn fool . . . . Genius may appear early or it may remain hidden until late in life . Such examples as Moses , Titian , Goethe , Holmes and many others who were at their peak late in life are too well known to require more than passing mention . " The most famous The modern Moses , GrandDebonair ma , began her paintAge ing career in her late seventies . By the time she was a hundred , it had brought her nearly a million and she was still going strong . Last summer just before her hundred and first birthday , her doctor ordered rest . It bored her so that she stole his stethoscope to use as a bargaining point in the effort to get back to work . Maurice Chevalier , after spending most of a full life as a straw-hatted song-and-dance man , made a new career for himself when he was nearing seventy as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language . We have come so far from Cicero that we readily accepted Chevalier in " Gigras a debonair oldster who took much more joy in living than his young nephew could find . He was completely convincing when he sang , " Oh , I 'm so glad that I 'm not young any more ! " He made it obvious ; it was n't even a special thought for Thanksgiving .
