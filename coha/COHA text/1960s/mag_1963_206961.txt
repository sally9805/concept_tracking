Manhattan 's William Zeckendorf , 57 , buys properties the way other people buy record albums . The trouble is that Zeckendorf 's base of operations , the New York realty firm of Webb &; Knapp , Inc. , has sometimes been barely a step ahead of its creditors . It seemed a healthy and restraining influence on Zeckendorf 's unorthodox dealings when 13 months ago he took on as his partners the London real estate firm of Second Covent Garden Properties Co . Ltd. - in return for $43,750,000 in needed cash and loan guarantees that Second Covent pumped into Zeckendorf 's $400 million empire . The new British partners shrewdly insisted on one condition : anything they did not like would not happen at Webb &; Knapp . <P> Last week , conceding that his wheeling and dealing " might not be a proper Englishman 's cup of tea , " ebullient Bill Zeckendorf announced Evacuation Day for the hapless British . He acknowledged that his three British representatives , as well as three Americans whom the British had named to the board , had resigned as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Webb &; Knapp stock ) . The British had found Zeckendorf impossible to harness or control . Barely controlling his own glee at having shucked off his British advisers , Zeckendorf piously admitted : " They thought that they could reform the old man , and I wish they had . " <P> To rid Webb &; Knapp of its bothersome short-term debts , the British had demanded that Zeckendorf sell some of Webb &; Knapp 's holdings . But Zeckendorf 's idea of liquidation differed from his partners ' : though he sold some holdings , he kept right on buying others ( among the purchases : $25 million for Manhattan 's Savoy Hilton Hotel ) . Outraged , the British sent to New York a relay of executives , who camped out in Zeckendorf 's Madison Avenue offices to try to halt his acquisitions . But , in his own inimitable way , Zeckendorf confounded the British Expeditionary Force . He made his deals at breakfast , while driving in his car , at midnight meetings-and sometimes tumbled his British directors out of bed at 3 a.m. by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew little about . <P> Unaccustomed to that sort of guerrilla warfare , the British retreated in some order . They still keep their position in Zeckendorf Property Corp. , an affiliate that they insisted be spun off from Webb &; Knapp in 1961 , where they are joint partners with Webb &; Knapp with 47.5% each ( the remaining sliver belongs to Alcoa ) . Zeckendorf Property has under way 13 promising urban development projects , including Manhattan 's Lincoln Towers , and Zeckendorf plans to continue linking up with partners to build mw development projects-but to keep ouTsiders out of Webb &; Knapp . He hopes that assiduous real estate trading can keep the company going until the income from the projects begins to roll in.
