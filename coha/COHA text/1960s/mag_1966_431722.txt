 | Life without him @# Death , to the novelist , is a familiar theme . I am one of those who , like a spider , spin a web ; the reatures caught in the web have no substance , reality . It is only when death touches you in . personal life that you realize the full impact of meaning . The death-bed scene . described so often in the past , becomes suddenly true . The - hock is profound . When my husband died a year and a half ago , was as though the sheltered cloud-land that . ad enveloped me for years , peopled with images drawn from my imagination , suddenly dissolved , and I was face-to-face with a harsh and rerrible reality . The husband I had loved and taken for granted for thirty-three years of married life , father of my three children . lay dead . One of my first reactions , after the first bewildered fit of weeping , was to blame myself . I could have done more during the last illness , I told myself ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ominous signs . I should have known , the last week , the last days , that his eyes followed me with greater intensity , and , instead f moving about the house on trivial business , i should never have left his side . How heartless , . n retrospect , was my last good night , when he murmured to me , " I ca n't sleep , " and I kissed him and said , " You will , darling , you will , " and went from the room . Perhaps if I had sat with him all night , the morning would have been otherwise . As it was , when morning came and the nurses who had shared his vigil expressed some anxiety about his pallor , I went to him , expecting , possibly , an increase of weakness but inevitably the usual smile . Instead he turned his face to me and died . My readers will have heard of the " kiss of life .

What had been living was no more . This , then , was the finality of death . Described by myself in books , times without number . Experienced at last . The aftermath of shock forced me to action instead of to collapse . I had to telephone my children . Make arrangements . See that necessary things were done . It was not until the cremation , which only my children and a few close friends attended , was over and I had scattered my husband 's ashes at the end of the garden where we often walked together , and my children had returned to their own homes , that I knew , with full force , the finality of death . I was alone . The newly discovered tenderness of my daughters , the sudden maturity of my son , himself to become a father within a few months , had not prevailed upon me to go back with one of them . No , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in my own home , by myself . To go elsewhere , even with them , continued on page 166  | would postpone the moment of truth . What had to be endured must be endured now , alone . I must force myself to look upon familiar things , the coat hanging the chair , the hat in the hall , and remind myself that this was not the separation of war that we had known twenty years earlier , but separation all time . To ease the pain I took over some of his things for myself . I wore his shirts , sat at his desk , used his pens to acknowledge the hundreds of letters of condolence that arrived by every mail , and , by the very process of iden tification with the objects he had touched , felt closer to him . The evenings were the hardest to bear . The ritual of the hot drink , the lumps of sugar to the two dogs , the saying of prayers -- his boyhood habit carried on throughout our married life ? the good-night kiss . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in its very poignancy , a consolation . I wept often because I could not pr . - vent the tears . Possibly , in some w , beyond my understanding , the tea- , helped the healing process , but t : . physical act of weeping was distressing . to me beyond measure . I thought lo-.c and often about the possibility of litafter death . Baptized and confirmed the Christian faith , I acknowledge no denomination , yet have an instinctive yearning for survival , as indeed the human race has always had . I liked to think of my husband reunited with the parents who had gone before him , and with his comrades o : two world wars . I liked to think that all pain , all suffering had been wiped out , that he now knew what none of us can know here on earth ? indescribable joy , the " peace which passes all understanding . " Yet I had seen his empty shell . I had seen the light flicker and go out . Where had it gone ? Was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a candle . and does each one of us , in the end , vanish into darkness ? If it is so , and our dreams of survival after death are only dreams , then we must accept this too . Not with fear and dismay , but with courage . For to have lived at all is a measure of immortality . For a baby to be born , to become a man or woman , to beget others like himself is an act of faith in itself , even an act of defiance . It is as though every human being born into this world burns , for a brief moment , like a star , and because of it a pinpoint of light shines in the darkness , and so there is glory , so there is life . If there is nothing more than this , we have achieved our immortality . Meanwhile , for the bereaved , who will never know the answer here on earth , the practical living of day by day continues . To plan for only one , instead of for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " Why bother ? What can teh future hold ? " " At least , " said a kind , well-wishing friend , " you have your writing , " as though , with a magic wand , I could conjure a host of dancing peppets who , by their antics , would prove an antidote to pain . Yes , I have my writing , but the stories I once fashioned were fairy tales , and they can not satisfy me now . Death , surely , will make me more aware of other people 's suffering , of other people 's ills , of the countless women there must be who have no form of consolation from without or from within . Some lack children , sisters , friends ; others are financially bereaved ; a vast number lived in their husband 's shadow and with the shadow gone feel themselves not fully individuals , unwanted and ignored . My grandmother , widowed at the same . age as I , at fifty-eight , entered upon old age with grace and dignity . She donne : her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see her now , a kindly , grave . i ' rather formidable figure , endeavoring to teach me how to knit . I look down today at my own weeds ? dark slacks a white pullover ? and wonder whether the change in garb is basic , a symbol of woman 's emancipation , or simply a change in fashion , for fundamental ' . : . the widow 's sense of loss remains unchanged . No matter how brave a face she puts upon her status , she is still lonely figure , belonging nowhere . An old friend of mine , aged eighty , who had lost his beloved wife after sixty years of marriage , suggested that the widowed form a Band of the Bereaved . like Alcoholics Anonymous , and , by sharing a common grief , learn to live with it . The proposition has its point , . but I could foresee drawbacks too What an invitation to the garrulous , to continued on page 171 @#  | the self-obsessed !

The old adage . " Time heals all wounds , " is only true if there is no suppuration within . To be bitter , to lament unceasingly , " Why did this have to happen to him ? " makes the wound fester ; the mind , renewing the stab , causes it to bleed afresh . It is hard , very hard , not to be bitter in the early days . Not to blame doctors , hospitals , drugs that failed to cure . Harder still for the woman whose husband died not by illness but by accident , who was cut short in full vigor. in the prime of life , killed perhaps in a car crash . The first instinct is to seek revenge upon the occupants of the other car whose selfish excess of speed caused the disaster . Yet this is no answer to grief . All anger , all reproach. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind and body . I would say to those who mourn . and I can only speak from my own experience : Look upon each day as a challenge , as a test of courage . The pain will come in waves , some days worse than others for no apparent reason . Accept the pain . Do not suppress it . Never attempt to hide grief from yourself . Little by little , just as the deaf , the blind , the handicapped develop , with time , an extra sense to balance their disability . so the bereaved the widowed , will find new strength . new vision , born of the very pain and loneliness which seems , at first , impossible to master .

We can never givto another what we gave to the partner who has gone . All that is over finished . And the years that lie ahead . ten , twenty , perhaps even thirty , must be traveled alone . This is a challenge just as marriage , in the first place , was a challenge . I remember that on our wedding day , long ago , the good priest who married my husband and me drew a comparison between the little boat in which we were to set forth on our honeymoon and marriage itself .

Even if I must , of necessity , steer my boat alone , I shall not . so I trust , lose my bearings , but because of all I have learned through the past three and thirty years , with my fellow helmsman at my side , come eventually to my journey 's end . One final word to my contemporaries . Take time to plan your future . Do not let your relatives or friends , anxious for your welfare , push you into some hasty move that later you may regret . If it is financially possible for you , stay in your own home , with the familiar things about you . We need many months to become reconciled the loss that has overtaken us , and : .

It is as though one shared , in some indefinable manner , the freedom and the peace , even at times the joy , of another world , where there is no more pain . This feeling is not only a ques-  | tion of faith , or of belief . It is not +-prerogative of the devout . It is simply there , pervading all thought , all action . When Christ , the healer , said " Blessed are they that mourn for they shall comforted , " he must have meant just this . Later , if you go away , if you travel even if you decide to make your home elsewhere , the spirit of tenderness . love , will not desert you .
