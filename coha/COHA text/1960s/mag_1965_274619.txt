The biggest copycats in U.S. business are the manufacturers of copying machines , which are proliferating faster than paperwork in the nation 's offices . <P> Since Xerox brought out the first electrostatic copier in 1960 , more than 40 companies have elbowed into the increasingly profitable but competitive business , whose sales of $600 million are rising 20% annually . Into the field last week came another major manufacturer : Los Angeles ' huge Litton Industries ( fiscal 1965 sales : $916 million ) . As the first of what will ultimately become a whole family of copiers , Litton introduced the desktop Roy fax 7 , which spins out seven dry copies a minute , reproduces documents as varied as 51-in. invoices and 362-ft. seismographic tapes . Introducing a tantalizing gimmick , Litton plans to install the machines for nothing , make its money by selling zinc oxide-coated paper for them at 4 per letter-size sheet . <P> Follow the Leader . Quicker , cheaper , lighter , more versatile copiers-that is what all the manufacturers are rushing out . At last week 's annual Business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co. showed off a new coin-operated copier for use in banks , libraries or other places where people will pay for reproductions ( probable price per letter-size copy : 100 ) . Long Island 's Viewlex displayed a 20-lb. copier that retails for $249.50 . Such competitors as A. B. Dick , Copease , Bell &; Ho well 's Ditto subsidiary and Addressograph 's Bruning Division introduced new models that transpose almost all colors and shadings-whose lines in the past have been difficult for the machines to reproduce-into clear black-and-white copies . <P> Everyone aims to duplicate the success of Xerox , whose sales since 1960 have multiplied from $40 million to almost $400 million , and are expanding 50% yearly . Many competitors pay tribute to Xerox-in dollars . Xerox collects an enviable but undisclosed sum in royalties from such companies as Apeco , SCM and Bruning , which lease and sell their own machines and market the zinc oxide-coated paper that Xerox has patented . Meanwhile , Xerox has discarded the coated-paper means of copying , now uses plain paper . While competitors argue that their copies are cheaper-about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because its plain paper is more convenient , does not have the slippery feel of the coated paper . <P> Almost Like Typewriters . Though Xerox is sometimes considered vulnerable because it has only one product , the future seems promising for almost everyone in the industry . The copying machines will turn out 10 billion or more copies in 300,000 U.S. offices this year ; by 1970 , they will be producing 25 billion copies , and the industry 's sales will top $1 billion . SCM President Emerson Mead predicts that desktop copiers will eventually become so compact and inexpensive that many a secretary will have one right next to her typewriter . His confidence in the future market for such time-savers is one reason that SCM has dropped out of the carbon-paper business .
