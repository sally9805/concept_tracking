BOSWELL 'S JOURNAL OF A TOUR TO THE HEBRIDES WITH SAMUEL JOHNSON , LL.D . ( 520 pp. ) - Edited by Frederick A. Pottle and Charles H. Bennett-McGraw-Hill ( $10 ) . <P> <P> Boswell 's matchless life of Dr. Johnson made rather small potatoes of their engaging tour together through the Hebrides . But the tour was unforgettable in many ways-and this eighth volume of Yale University 's edition of Boswell 's papers lets the reader count the ways . It pictures Johnson-the most ungainly of oldsters , the most nearsighted of onlookers , the most sedentary of talkers , the most fanatical of Londoners-perched atop tiny horses , half-drowned in pitching vessels , sleeping in chilly barns and clambering over rocks in remote Scottish islands . And by the side of this most incongruous of Crusoes trudges the most inspired of Man Fridays . <P> Published in 1785 , Boswell 's Tour proved a sort of tryout for the Life that appeared six years later . But the published Tour varied considerably from the actual journal that Boswell kept , most of which turned up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First brought out in 1936. the journal is now reprinted with much supplementary mate rial drawn from documents that have since come to light . Densely annotated , the present volume is as formidable as Johnson , but much of it , freed of foot notes , is also as chatty as only Boswell could be . <P> Endless Gibes . The Tour has a double value to the very degree that Boswell had a double aim in writing it . His first concern was his hero , and only his second the Hebrides . The two objectives sometimes gloriously combine , but they can just as gloriously clash . Scotland was always for Johnson a pet target that he waggishly exploited as a pet aversion ; it produced endless gibes on tour as well as at home .
