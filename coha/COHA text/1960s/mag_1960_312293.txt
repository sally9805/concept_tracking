In the weeks before their 1960 presidential primary . West Virginians got plenty fed up with outside newsmen who toured their state and wrote shocked reports of its backwardness and bigotry . The article that seemed to irritate them the most appeared in the Saturday Evening Post and described West Virginia as a " schizophrenic " ' state , populated by hillbillies , with an " enormous " illiteracy rate and " a higher ratio of illegitimate white babies than any other state . " Last week West Virginia bit back : to Philadelphia , the Saturday Evening Post 's home town , went a reporter-photographer team from the Charleston Daily Mail . Result : a two-part piece on America 's " filthy cradle of liberty . " <P> Tramping Philadelphia 's streets , the Mailmen , found and photographed debris-piled back yards , trash-littered alleys , garbage-lined gutters and ramshackle outhouses . " Putting it bluntly , " wrote Reporter Charlie Connor , " much of Philadelphia stinks . " He noted that 2,200,000 Philadelphians are crammed into a 127-sq. - mi. area as against 2,000,000 West Virginians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Philadelphia 's pains , " wrote Connor . " It 's like having all the pain in one big toe , whereas West Virginia , at least , has its aches spread over all its toes . " <P> Where the Saturday Evening Post had written sadly of West Virginia 's hungry hillbilly children , the Daily Mail found its own pathetic Philadelphian . It frontpaged the plight of 15-year-old Ricky Westcott , an 87-lb. shoeshine boy with a stomach ulcer , who worked the city 's streets until late at night to buy the food his destitute family could not provide . The boy had one great desire : I 'd sure like to go hunting and fishing in West Virginia . " An invitation to underwrite his expenses was soon forthcoming , and with it a friendly letter from West Virginia 's Governor Cecil H. Underwood .
