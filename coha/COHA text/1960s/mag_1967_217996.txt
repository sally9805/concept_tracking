I NTERVIEWING people is the most important way of getting ' news . We do it all the time , and the job is mostly up to our correspondents , but researchers , writers and editors enthusiastically join in when they get the opportunity . So we have occasionally wondered just what it feels like to be interviewed by TIME . <P> Harrowing , we have been told by some . It may not be all that bad . Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare John Gardner was interviewed at length for this week 's cover story by Reporter Michael McManus , both in his office and at home , and seems to have weathered the ordeal well . " It 's been driving energy all the way , " he said gamely , " and that 's what I like . " <P> A few weeks ago , Publisher Bennett Cerf also enjoyed the experience . " What greater joy is there in the world , " he asked , " than talking about yourself to someone who 's paid to listen ? " <P> Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ebulliently . Industrialist-Art Collector Norton Simon compared his sessions to a " threeday physical exam at a clinic . You know you 'll be poked , probed and punctured , and you 'd better tell all because they 'll find out anyway . " The late Author John Marquand told Reporter Ruth Mehrtens that the interviews were better than being psychoanalyzed . Oceanographer Jacques Yves Cousteau recalls with a shudder , and some slight exaggeration , that he was rarely alone for three months : " Your reporters followed me everywhere . Once I tried to hide in a motel , but they found me . " And Architect William Pereira likened his interview to an initiation rite : " You approach it with apprehension and endure it with what you hope is a convincing show of manly valor . " <P> Simon , Cousteau and Pereira all were pleased with the finished stories , which we hope is the case most of the time . But it is not always . " It was tantamount to a mountain laboring to bring forth a mouse , " thundered Boston 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Said Producer David Merrick , who will say anything : " Is it true the entire staff of TIME is on LSD ? " <P> Not many people are as relaxed as Author Jean Kerr , who remarks : " I did n't bother to be discreet . I thought , if I have to be careful I just wo n't tell anything . So I told everything . " Each interviewer has his own questioning techniques , but what they all strive for is a rapport that will allow the subject to relax enough to show his real character . " It 's wonderful if people will talk freely , just bubble on , " says Theater Critic Theodore Kalem . " Lauren Bacall happens to be the bar-buddy sort of girl who is easy to talk to . " New York 's Mayor John Lindsay told Correspondent Nick Thimmesch : " Everybody in government would like to write his own story . Short of that , you just have to trust the reporter . " And , he might have added , the writers and editors , who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIME . <P> From our point of view , some pretty valuable advice to prospective interviewees comes from Heavyweight Champion Cassius Clay : " Look your best . Treat the reporter extra nice . Give him extra time . There are so many people in line to get on that cover . "
