Into the red and green conference room of Greater Miami Beach 's Americana Hotel stepped pink and grey President George Meany for the annual midwinter huddle of his A.F.L.-C.I.O. executive council last week-and he forthwith boomed out a judgment that may haunt him for months . <P> What , asked a reporter , did Meany think about the likelihood that Harlem Democrat Adam Clayton Powell Jr . will become chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee next year ? " Terrible , " said forthright George Meany . " He has a bad voting and absentee record . He uses his position to stir up racial hatred . It 's terrible to think that we will have a man like that as chairman . " <P> Many unionists share Meany 's opinions of Powell , pastor of Harlem 's Abyssinian Baptist Church , husband of Entertainer Hazel Scott and congressional eight-termer. * They also fear that Powell , by using his old technique of tacking hopeless civil rights riders on to favorable labor bills , will effectively block the bills . Despite this sound suspicion , Meany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface some old inter-union disputes that threaten to split the A.F.L.-C.I.O . In particular , it rekindled a smoldering feud between Meany and able , aging ( 70 ) Asa Philip Randolph , head of the Sleeping Car Porters union and conspicuously the only Negro in the A.F.L.-C.I.O. high command . Honest A. Philip Randolph is no steady supporter of crafty Congressman Powell , but he felt obliged to defend Powell and rebuke Meany . <P> Though both oppose segregation . Meany and Randolph have been scrapping over the issue for months . Moderate Meany has steadily but quietly pressured unions to drop their color bars ; in his 20 years of leadership the number of all white A.F.L. unions has dropped from 26 to only one - the 97,000-member Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen . Even so , there are Jim Crow locals aplenty , and Randolph publicly criticized Meany at the union 's convention last fall for not purging them . Meany blew up , roared at Randolph , " Who the hell appointed you as guardian of all Negroes in America ? " Since then , Randolph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is busily whipping together the " Negro American Labor Council , " which aims to embrace the 1,500,000 Negro members of the A.F.L.-C.I.O . With such numbers , Randolph could press to crack open the all-white locals ( in the building trades , among papermakers , boilermakers , etc. ) , get Negroes into apprentice training programs now closed to them , and lift Negroes to loftier positions in the A.F.L.-C.I.O. command . Chapters of Randolph 's all-Negro group are abuilding from New York to the Pacific Coast . Despite Meany 's opposition to such racially based splinter groups , the founding convention is set for Detroit this May . And Meany 's whittling of Congressman Powell can not help sharpening the splinters . <P> <P> * Powell 's trial on two-year-old charges of evading federal income taxes will finally come to court in Manhattan on March 7.
