Charles Hyneman , a non-lawyer whose specialty is the theory of democratic government , has presented us with clear , perceptive , impressive  --  and ultimately meaningless  --  study of - the decision-making role of our highest tribunal . Let me immediately confess that " meaningless " refers less to shortcomings in Professor Hyneman than to my own skepticism , a condition which I hope indicates admirable qualities in both of us but a perversity in the subject matter itself . I , for one , do not believe that impartial scholarship about our highest Court can be profitable Invective would be , or special pleading , or gossip or plausible evasions ; never bland rationality , however keen it might be . Why not ? Because under the judicial robes will always be men for whom rationality is the means of exonerating their prior inclinations . The raw data presented for adjudication ( a e. , the litigants ' condemnation of one another 's benighted self-interest ) as fed into the data-processing organism Ali , to have known , to have loved too many Day-ids and Judiths ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally , most intimate of all , at the end of " Soft Wood , " that ultimate knowledge  --  somatic and psychological , private and political  --  of the cost of surcease : Each drug that numbs alerts another nerve to pain . Such knowledge , with the release it brings , is of the highest order of sanity , of ripeness , of detachment from the destructive element . One remarks with a sense of poetic justice that this book is not dedicated to parent or wife or child , but beyond the bonds Of blood and passion , to a friend . Richard Howard is working on his second book of poems ; his first was Quantities ( Wesleyan ) He writes criticism for The New Leader , Partisan Review and Poetry ( i. e , the head count which registers the Justices ' unique views about proper behavior in legal crises ) can no more be understood by reference to pure constitutional principles - than a marriage can be by reference to the nuptial vows . Both judicial and marital ceremonies gratify the spectators , but the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , disagrees about the value of his work . In this book , he focuses on the constitutional basis , if any , of judicial review and on the contrasting techniques by which activist and self-restrained Judges promulgate our law . He concludes his analysis by declaring that scholarship can prepare us for a wise location of authority to deal with problems that call for statesmanship . By analyzing the judicial , process and judicial review he feels we can gain insight into the central question of how power is mOst wisely distributed 111 -a governmental system . When we appreciate what our judges have in fact been doing and how those judges , elected officials and appointed bureaucracies , are knitted together in a compact governmental structure , we will be capable of mak : ing our own judgments as to the proper use of judicial power . But how can we ever know what is a proper use until we know what is a proper result ? And how can we ever know what is a proper result until we discover that the way we achieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we detest ? Can we , today , settle for a political system where power is wisely distributed when the repositories of that power will be men conscious of the flaws in their competitors ' authority ? What men can we trust with what words ? Must we establish an inflexible system of checks and balances , in detail as well as in principle , when the real value of a Court of ' last resort is its enviable chance to do the unexpected ? What I suggest is that we recognize our highest tribunal as the mechanism by which any of us can perform a decisive act . In a nation of some 200 million people , separately unable to understand or influence the stream of events , a single individual can disrupt our national affairs in only two ways . He can either become a political assassin or a litigant in the Supreme Court . Regarded in that light , despite the indifferent odds against any one petition or appeal being heard- , the Court stands for the promise that - none of us is so overwhelmed by - population statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferably in forty printed - copies , accompanied by a $100 docket fee ) and set this country right . Professor Hyneman 's neutrality seems out of place in such an arena , even though he has undertaken the role of nonpartisan observer to assist others in compiling their own measurements of judicial virtues . We can not fairly evaluate the wisdom or morality of - the Court 's patterns of action until we , like the Court , encounter actual cases or controversies . Neither law nor justice can exist without winners , losers and anxious magistrates , for the concepts can be defined only in the concrete instance and not as abstractions . Beyond the here and now , our principles are inadequate assumptions that only a villain 's ox will be gored . Rather than accept Professor Hyneman 's balanced account of our Judicial branch , I prefer my own comment , given under stress , to a politically conservative dentist in the momentary interval between his frowning , " Well , you 're a lawyer . How can you justify what they 're up to ? " and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nay mouth . " The Supreme Court , " I - said , " does what it thinks it should do . "
