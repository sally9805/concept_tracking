In a mildewed villa in Laos ' capital city of Vientiane sits a bland , tired-eyed Premier named Prince Souvanna Phouma . He says his neutralist government wants to make peace with everybody , including the Communists . He has the support of two crack paratroop battalions , one of them under command of Captain Kong Le , whose coup last August brought Souvanna Phouma to power . <P> Down in the south is the country 's top soldier , General Phoumi Nosavan , 40 , who does not like Communists and says that the prince in Vientiane can not tell a Red from a banyan tree . Several leaders of Laos ' 28,000-man army - armed , trained and paid by U.S. aid-support Phoumi 's right-wing rebellion . Also working for the general is the fact that he has had help from Marshal Sarit , strongman of the neighboring kingdom of Thailand , whom he calls uncle ( actually , he is a first cousin once removed ) . Vientiane gets all its fuel and most of its food from Thailand , and Sarit has in effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mekong River from Vientiane . <P> Up in the north and behind quite a few trees lurk the guerrillas of Pathet Lao , the military arm of the Laotian Communist Party . Pathet Lao bands are armed , trained and directed by Communist North Viet Nam , but their official leader is Prince Souphanouvong , the Premier 's half brother . <P> Test for the Right . Last week the SEATO powers led by the U.S. were trying to end this three-way war by bringing pressure to reconcile Premier Souvanna and General Phoumi . Their argument : the only side winning in the fight is the Communist Pathet Lao . At first Phoumi proved stubborn , ignoring four telegrams from the King asking him to meet with the Premier 's military representatives at the royal palace in Luangprabang . But the new month was approaching , bringing pay day for his troops , and U.S. aid , which normally covers the army 's wages , goes only to the legal government , i.e. , Premier Souvanna . <P> Furthermore , Phoumi 's troops had disastrously flunked their first real military test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town of Paksane toward Vientiane , boasting that they would dine in the capital that evening . But then they encountered about 500 of Captain Kong Le 's paratroopers on a muddy road . Phoumi 's men fled , leaving weapons , ammunition and trucks . Last week General Phoumi meekly flew to Luangprabang , accepted a ceasefire , and began negotiations to get some of his own men into the Cabinet . <P> Drift to the Left . At week 's end , Premier Souvanna announced that a garrison of Phoumi 's men at Samneua had fallen to the Pathet Lao . Not so , said Captain Kong Le . His own men , aided by Pathet Lao and local villagers , had taken Samneua . " I do n't care about the ceasefire , " added Kong Le , who apparently commands the only really effective fighting force in all Laos , and likes to see things done his way . " We will keep fighting until all the Phoumi men surrender . " <P> Looking very harassed , Premier Souvanna replied that the captain " has no say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. suspended military aid to Laos , because , said General Williston B. Palmer , director of military assistance , " the situation is so confused we have not been sure who is responsible for anything . "
