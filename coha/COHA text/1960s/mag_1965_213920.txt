Plywood , that prosaic sandwich of wood and glue , was long a low-prestige commodity used chiefly in such things as panel doors , ping-pong tables and bureau-drawer bottoms . No longer . Glamorized almost beyond recognition , it has taken on fancy surfaces , been merged with other materials and found its way into such diverse places as giant freeway signs , the stands for Lyndon Johnson 's Inauguration and the outside walls of a 24-story building in San Francisco . Demand for plywood has doubled in the past seven years , and this year the $1 billion industry expects to sell a record 13 billion sq . ft . To keep up , the two biggest U.S. plywood companies are launching major expansions . Georgia-Pacific Corp . has just announced plans to build new plants at Crossett , Ark. , and Emporia , Va. , and U.S. Plywood Corp . has broken ground for a new $3,000,000 mill at Hammond , La . <P> To the South . The location of the three new plants reflects a significant trend . Plywood makers have begun to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in softwood plywood that the Douglas-fir-growing Pacific Northwest has enjoyed for decades . In the past year , three new mills have opened in Texas and Arkansas to make plywood from the faster-growing Southern pine . Weyerhaeuser Co. , the world 's biggest producer of timber products , is building a plant at Plymouth , N.C. Vancouver Plywood is at work on two plants in Louisiana , and at least eleven other firms are planning or building Southern plants and scrambling to tie up timber stands . Their total investment will come close to $100 million . Says U.S. Plywood President Gene C. Brewer : " I can see the day coming when the South might produce 25% of the nation 's plywood . " <P> Plywood is migrating South partly to save freight ( the South is nearer to most markets than the Northwest ) and partly to take advantage of the South 's rising supply of available timber , but it is a new technology that makes the move possible . New glues and dryers developed by the industry have overcome Southern pine 's high moisture and pitch content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Automated loaders and lathes can now handle pine logs , which are much smaller than fir , and peel off layers of veneer . <P> Russians First . Though the Russians were the first commercial makers of plywood ( they began packing tea in plywood boxes in the 1870s ) , American manufacturers have long since grabbed the world-production lead . The growing do-it-yourself market absorbs 8% of their output , and industrial uses account for another 15% , but half of the nation 's plywood now goes into housing . By aggressive promotion , self-imposed quality control and imaginative research to develop new uses for plywood , the industry has boosted the amount built into the average new home from 500 sq . ft. in 1950 to 2,700 sq . ft. last year . Even more remarkable , the cost of plywood has dropped 30% in a decade . Because recent floods in the Northwest did $50 million damage to the lumber and plywood industries , plywood prices have climbed $12 per thousand sq . ft. this month , . including a jump last week from $70 to $72 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it cleans up the damage-and its move to the South speeds up .
