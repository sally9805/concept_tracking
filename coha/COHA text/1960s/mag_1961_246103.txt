Prescription drugs would be cheaper and more effective if manufacturers would market fewer of them , says Dr. Walter Modell of Cornell University Medical College , one of America 's foremost drug experts . He also believes that this is the way to bigger profits for the companies . <P> Writing of pharmaceutical chemists in Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics , Dr. Modell asked : " Will they realize that there are too many drugs for the patient , for the physician , and , surprisingly enough , for the pharmaceutical industry ? " No fewer than 150,000 preparations are now in use , of which 90% did not exist 25 years ago , and 75% did not exist ten years ago . About 15,000 new mixtures and dosages hit the market each year , while about 12,000 die off . <P> These figures , says Dr. " Modell , reflect the fact that new drugs are often introduced not because they are better than existing drugs or because there is a real need for them , but " to horn in on a market which has been created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " structural roulette " the game of making a minor change in the molecule of a competitor 's drug , to get around patent restrictions , and rushing the resultant analogue to market . He points to one manufacturer " who sells one drug entity in this country and a congener close chemical relative in another country , " and argues that " each is the best for the same purpose . Since more than one drug can not be the best for the same indication , we simply do n't have enough diseases to go around . At the moment the most helpful contribution is the new drug to counteract the untoward effects of other new drugs ; we now have several of these . " Dr. Modell recommends that manufacturers exercise self-restraint by making and marketing only the single best drug for each purpose , and cross-license one another to spread both risks and profits . One of the most successful of all U.S. companies , he says , introduces the smallest number of new drugs and does the least " molecule manipulation . " The others , Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as that of bewildered doctors and patients .
