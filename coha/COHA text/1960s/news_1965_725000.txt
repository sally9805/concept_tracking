txt Senator Robert F. Kennedy 's charge that the state does not provide proper care for mentally retarded children is supported by the hitherto secret report of a special legislative team that made a four-month investigation a year ago . The Senator 's charge , made Thursday before a legislative committee , reverberated here and in Albany yesterday . The state 's Acting Commissioner of Mental Hygiene , Dr.1 Christopher F. Terrence , said he would seek " a substantial increase " in funds for the schools ' Mr. Kennedy criticized . At the same time , Dr. Terrence protested that the Senator had " distorted out of all perspective " the conditions at the schools . But detailed confirmation of Senator Kennedy 's findings is contained in the confidential report of a team of three women who visited every mental institution in the state for the Joint Legislative Committee on Mental Retardation . Senator Sought Release The investigators were Mrs. Olga DeFelippo , president of the Guild for Exceptional Children and wife of a Brooklyn physician ; Mrs. Helen Kerner , also of Brooklyn , and Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association for Retarded Children . Their report to the committee was forwarded to Governor Rockefeller . Senator Kennedy , in his statement Thursday , called on the Governor to make the report public . The Governor 's press secretary , Robert L. , said this was " in no sense a refined report " and that it " would n't be appropriate " to make it public . Accounts Are Similar The New York Times obtained I a copy of the report yesterday . It is a 37-page , single-spaced , typewritten document , contain-1 ing separate reports on each of the institutions visited . There was a remarkable similarity between Senator Ken- , nedy 's account of his recent i visits to the Willowbrook and Rome state schools and the ' women 's findings about the same institutions . A spokesman for Senator Kennedy said yesterday , however , that the Senator had not seen the confidential report either before or after his surprise visits . Following is an excerpt from the investigators ' report on Building 20 at Willowbrook , which is on Staten Island : " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around ) in the day room , stepping over , climbing over and clawing at each other  --  all in bodily contact ? due to lack of space . " It was in this building that the murder of one retardate by another had taken place just a few weeks before . Living under such inhuman conditions could only provoke more of these Incidents . It is a snake-pit type of existence . " The stench was vile in all the day rooms . In the dormitories , beds are placed close to each other with barely an inch between them . " Section Is Emphasized In the only part of the report in which capital letters were used for emphasis , the investigators said : " The Department of Mental Hygiene must find other facilities immediately to accommodate new admissions from the New York area , " In addition , new facilities must be found in order to transfer retardates out of Willowbrook in order to alleviate the enormous overcrowding which exists , " Finally , new facilities must be found to house the ? delinquents and homosexuals who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found conditions almost as deplorable . " What we saw in Building H was shocking , " they reported . " In Ward 23 some youngsters were sitting on benches , others sleeping on the bare floor , clothed in underpants only . This filthy room with defecation on the floor served as the day room and dining room for 130 active children . Their little bodies and faces were dirty and scratched . " The picture was not totally grim , however . The report on Rome also includes this passage : " In Building 0 for educable and trainable girls , ages 6.18 , we found a pleasant , cheerful atmosphere in the combined ward and day room . Toys and games were in evidence , We noticed that clothing rooms were particularly clean and neat with items tagged , and shoes and rubbers were in individual cubbyholes , " All lockers were near the dormitories . We were pleased to note that in all bathrooms and most of the dormitories there were mirrors available for grooming . " In general , the female service of Rome State School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humane . There was a noticeable homelike atmosphere and employe interest and enthusiasm . " The women also praised the care provided for retarded children in the ancient brick building of Gouverneur Hospital on Manhattan 's Lower East Side . " New brick and mortar is no guarantee of good care , " they said . " It is the hopeful , dedicated philosophy and attitude of the director Dr. Harold Schiller and his staff which sifts down to the very level of the attendant and results in better care for the children . " ' Stench Was Revolting ' At the Craig Colony in Sonyea , then restricted to epileptic patients , but now housing mental defectives as well , the investigators made this finding : " There were many emaciated looking , unclothed males lying in bed in their own excrement , The stench was revolting , These patients are spoonfed in their beds , bathed and shaved twice weekly . " We were ushered to a subbasement area where about 15 ambulatory patients were eating in a dungeon-like , dirty atmosphere with a commerical dishwasher belching steam at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in a residence for youngsters under 12 , one attendant worked alone on the , evening shift and was expected to spoonfeed , bathe , diaper and care for 38 children . " We were informed , " the re port states , " that on many occasions because of lack of time , some of these children go unfed at the evening meal . " The three authors of the report are members of the advisory committee to the Joint Legislative Committee . A spokesman for the Department of Mental Hygiene said the report had been considered when the department developed its master plan . The master plan , described in seven volumes to be made public on Monday , includes a program lof expanded treatment for the mentally retarded . The confidential legislative ' report was not mentioned yesterday , however , when the de . I partment called a news con . Iference in Albany to reply to Senator Kennedy 's charges . Reasons for Conference Dr. Terrence was joined at the news conference by Dr. George Wadsworth , assistant commissioner for the mentally ' retarded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Commissioner said he had called the session to avoid " the appearance of insensitivity on our part to the charges  --  the implication that we denied ; nothing . " He acknowledged that the state spent 66,50 a day for the care of each mental patient , not including administration . He compared this with po a day for basic care in a general liospital . Ideally , he said , the base should be $12 a day . He said he planned to ask the Legislature for $60 million additional next year to raise the budget to that level . " The use by Senator Kennedy ) of the word ' brutality ' affected me , " Dr. Terrence went on . " Certainly if he saw brutality it was unusual . Rumors , hearsay , perhaps ; I do n't know . " Dr. Terrence said that only three of the state schools for mentally retarded were now overcrowded : Willowbrook , Rome in Oneida County , and Wassaic in Dutchess County . He said a new school would open soon in Suffolk County and another ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By transferring patients , he said , the department hopes to reduce the number at Willowbrook to about 4,000 . Last July , 5,363 were there .
