txt New York City has received Federal and state approval to set up a citywide " simplified payments system " for welfare clients , replacing in part special grants that had skyrocketed to $13-million in June  --  more than triple last year 's monthly rate . The State Department of Social Services said the city would be allowed to pay $100 annually for each relief recipient in four equal installments to cover clothing and household furnishing costs automatically instead of through special , grants . A state official said that economy was not the primary purpose of the move . One aim , he said , is to help relief recipients plan better for their own needs . Another is to aid everyone , instead of those most insistent in demanding special grants . The plan would eliminate the present investigations required before the special grants are approved and thus reduce administrative work . Basic Grants Rise 6% At the same time the state welfare agency authorized statewide increases approximating 6 per cent in regular basic grants to reflect increases in the cost of living . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect by localities some time within the next eight months at ' their discretion  --  probably Oct. 1 here . In addition the state agency introduced statewide a. , laundry allowance as part of the regular welfare grant . This will allow a family of four $7 a month to , be used either for commercial laundering or toward the purchase of a washing machine . The 1.2 million men , women and children on relief throughout the state get basic grants to cover regular recurring costs , and may get special grants if they show a need . Maximum Basic Grant The grants vary depending on the size of the family and the ages of its members . The maximum basic grant for a family made up of a mother and three children , of whom the oldest child is at least 16 , ' is now $202 a month . This will rise to $214 with the cost-1 of-living increase ' and to $221 with the new laundry provision , according to Joseph H. Louchheim , Deputy State Commissioner of Social Services . This is before rent and heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in grants in New York City and $95 upstate . On a 12-month , basis , these items would pro // vide $3,732 for such a family in New York City . A " simplified payments " program providing $100 a year for each of the four persons for clothing and furnishings would bring the family income here to $4,132 , or not quite $80 a week . If the mother were working she would have to earn $90 to $100 a week before taxes to match this sum , which is still before medical assistance available on need . On the other hand , the basic grant is much lower for a mother and three children of whom the oldest would be not more than 5 . This now starts at $136 a month and is to rise to $145 with the cost-of-living adjustment , Mr. Louchheim said . City to Announce Plan The actual details of New York City 's plan for a " simplified payments system " are to be announced by Jack R. Goldberg , the city 's Commissioner of Social Services , at a news conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a possibility that the city might revise the scope and sum in a manner differing from the $100 annual figure approved by the Federal Department of Health , Education and Welfare . The new plan would be a demonstration project under Section 1115 of the Federal Social Security Act for a year 's trial , with the Federal , state and city governments sharing the cost . The city department estimates relief rolls here have climbed to 875,000 persons this month . At $100 a person , this could mean a yearly bill of $87.5-million for the new system . Last year special and emergency grants here totaled about $46-million , but a drive by organized welfare clients starting last April has brought the 1968 cost to just about that sum as of the end of June . Commissioner Louchheim stressed that the new system was not being proposed pri. - madly as an economy measure . ' The Social Service Employes Union , with 7,500 caseworkers and other members , issued a statement yesterday favoring the ending of discretionary grants and establishment of a system " that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally  --  not only those with the energy and drive to demon-1 strate . But it charged that a $25 quarterly allowance per person was " so inadequate that it will probably do as much harm as good . " The Citywide Coordinating Committee of Welfare Groups , ' claiming 6,000 member families , brought out 150 persons to a City Hall demonstration yesterday denouncing any move that would eliminate all special allowances and promised a renewed demonstration at noon today . Hulbert James , the relief clients ' executive director , said that caseworkers had stopped giving out special grants last Friday at three Brooklyn centers and yesterday at a Bronx center . The city Department of Social Services denied starting any such policy , but confirmed that sit-ins by demonstrators had gone on over the weekend at the Brownsville and Linden centers in Brooklyn . In Albany , the state Department of Social Services said the cost-of-living adjustment would add $43-million a year to relief costs throughout the state and the new laundry provision would add $13-million . The over-all bill for welfare costs , including medical assistance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state is running at about $1.9-billion a year . The Welfare Patrolmen 's Benevolent Association said that its members began a " no arrest " policy yesterday in their campaign to be upgraded to a civil service title of " special patrolmen " and a legal status of peace officers , entitled to carry revolvers . Grady O'Cummings , their community relations adviser . said they were on duty but limited themselves to aiding clients needing help . City policemen were called to the Brownsville center at 163 Bradford Street , Brooklyn , to help handle disgruntled clients . In some centers other employes of the Social Services Department refused to go to complaint offices without the accompaniment of the special officers . Clients at several centers were told to form waiting lines outside the buildings .
