The big new boosters that rocketeers are racing to build may soon toss a man all the way to the moon , or out into the vast reaches between the planets . But though their spaceships are well advanced , scientists are still struggling with the problem of what the far-traveling astronaut ought to wear when he takes the big trip . It is far from a question of style ; it is a straightforward matter of survival . <P> Out in the vacuum of space , the properly suited explorer will have to be equipped with clothing that will let him work and move about actively . Outside a spaceship , where he may be called upon to make repairs , he will have to maneuver in zero gravity ; his clothing will have toward off solar heating twice as strong as on the earth 's surface . Any space suit will have to be equipped with a portable oxygen supply and its own air-conditioning apparatus . <P> Such problems have long since been solved by science fictioneers , but not in real life . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as anyone . Designed for use by astronauts of the Apollo moon project , Hamilton Standard 's space suit is made of several layers of rubber-impregnated fabric interlaced with ducts and supporting wires . Put in a vacuum chamber for testing with no one inside it , the suit was " flown " up to simulated altitudes as high as 130,000 ft . It stiffened and swelled , its arms spread outward like a gorilla 's , but it did not burst . Next stage was to take the suit up to altitude with a living man inside it , and that man was taking a considerable chance . If a sudden leak had developed at 130,000 ft. , the pressure inside would have fallen quickly to the point where human blood boils and death is almost instantaneous . But all went well , and the man could walk on a treadmill and use his arms with reasonable ease . <P> The next tests will take place in a new vacuum chamber that can duplicate both the cold of space and the merciless heat of the unshielded sun .
