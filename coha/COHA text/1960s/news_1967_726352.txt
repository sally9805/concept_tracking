txt Communism is agog with conflicting concepts : love of country versus world revolution ; socialism versus technocracy . The conflict comes out in many ways . The Kremlin has been jolted as seldom before by the challenge of Stalin 's daughter , Mrs. Svetlana Alliluyeva , embracing religion and defying the Soviet state . So far the Communist Party has remained mum . But a pattern of coordinated reaction can be inferred from comments by Soviets stationed in or visiting the West . In one way or another , many of them , as well as her son , accuse Mrs. Alliluyeva of having betrayed the motherland . In Cuba , the renewed Castro craze is world revolution . In his latest manifesto , the Cuban Premier declared that his party and the Cuban people stand firmly behind all Latin-American revolutionaries . He openly accused the Soviets of " collusion with Latin-American reactionary governments and oligarchies . " In the process , Premier Castro has tossed to the winds the Khrushchev stated acceptance of peaceful coexistence among countries of differing social systems . This rule in practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internationalism  --  another Communist shibboleth . " New Vietnams , " says Premier Castro , " must be set up in Latin America in order to compel American imperialism to disperse its forces . " Trends .. . In Poland nationalism and technocracy were denounced May 18 by a joint meeting of the ruling party 's Central Committee . No longer are revisionism and dogmatism the main culprits . Zenon Kliszko , second in command to the Polish party chief , has admitted for the first time that small groups or factions exist inside the party . One such group , supported by Peking , has circulated a new map of Poland which includes the Soviet cities of Lvov , Kiev , Minsk , Vilno , and Krolewicz . The latter is the Polish name for the former Prussian city of Koenigsberg . After World War II the Soviets renamed it Kaliningrad . Kiev , Minsk , and Vilno are the capital cities of the Ukrainian , Byelorussian , and Lithuanian Soviet Republics . Soviet legal theorists seem to be preparing their country for a change to the jury system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time have been advocating the reform . Last year a group of prominent Soviet legal luminaries visited Britain to study British law . They returned impressed , they said , by the impartiality of trial by jury , and the " superior " safeguards it affords the accused . For half a century Soviet judges have sat with two lay " people 's assessors . " In theory , the three jointly reach a verdict . In practice , because of laymen 's limited knowledge of the law , it is the judge who decides . Recently , one of the most eminent personalities of the Soviet Supreme Court urged that verdicts should be left " entirely " to the assessors. ? When the Soviet Union adopts trial by jury ? as now looks extremely likely ? it will be a tremendous fillip for reform in other Communist countries where legal rights have been prejudiced for years . How and why ... In economic matters , Romania is the East bloc 's last conservative holdout . It is still tightly wedded to rule through a monolithic party , with economic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country is said to be contemplating economic reform . All the other bloc countries have begun to scrap or modify some of the worst features Df their former rigidly centralized systems . Romania has a record of impressive industrial progress . And its independent foreign policy has drawn it closer to Yugoslavia . But Romanian Communists are frankly lorrified by Yugoslavia 's total decentralization and rapid march toward a market econ ) my . And almost as much repelled by the nore cautious reforms adopted by Hungarans and Czechs . At last , however , there are signs of new deas breaking through . A fact of the current Romanian scene is he country 's serious effort to learn from the Vest .
