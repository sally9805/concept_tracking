. And " everyone " must be right . And , had I seen him before I knew he had " fallen for me , " would I have agreed with everybody ? Was that what soured me on Everett ? What do I mean " soured " ? I loved him , did n't I ? Worked hard to win his proposal , his diamond , and his wedding band ? So what do I mean " soured " ? Just as I did n't say anything to Blix about Everett , I had n't said anything to June . I looked . I saw . A slender young man , five feet ten or eleven , was crossing a bridge in front of me . Neatly dressed . Too neatly ? Shoes with cloth tops . Why should I find this upsetting ? Why should I find toeing out unaccountably ugly ? Thousands of men walk that way . His pompadour added three or four inches to his height , his collar three or four inches to his neck . He looked dapper . At seventeen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build of a football player and the soul of a Byron . If that was what I wanted , Everett was disappointing , on sight . I am still plagued by the question " How would Everett have looked to me if I had seen him first ? " With no knowledge that he had asked me for a date . Was there in me , so early , something that made me relish irony ? Some experience , forgotten , that made me forearm myself for disappointment ? Say , " That 's the kind of boy , all right , who would fall for me ? " I do n't know . We went to the game in the back seat of the rented Reo , the faculty couple somehow maneuvered onto the jump seats , four of us wedged into the back seat . Everett had to put his arm around me ; from thigh to ankle we were Siamese twins . That 's what rented Reos were for . I had never before been touched by a boy , scarcely been touched by anyone , of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that October afternoon in the Reo . Touch ! I had never seen or smelled , tasted or heard , anthinglike it . While it was going on I did n't want to see , smell , taste , or hear . In fact , I could n't . Everett did n't do anything with his arm ; it lay , an inert weight , across my shoulders . He did n't do anything with his leg . Exert any pressure or initiate any movement . But it was there , and the whole of my body , exceptp101for these points of contact , died , and I lived in them a life so disturbing my whole world was transformed ; I was , pulse , body temperature , rate of respiration , all expectation . What did I care about a football game we lost 6 to 4o ? Or the carnival we went to afterward ? Everett got dizzy on the Ferris wheel , refused to drink Coke or root beer because he thought carbonation effete . ( Everett , for as long as I knew him , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rancher-farmer-cowboy ideal of himself . ) In the photographer 's booth , when we all had our pictures taken , he rested his chin on his tiepin and looked upward , so that nothing but the whites of his eyes was visible in the picture . But he had touched me . So I waited through Statue of Liberty plays and Ferris wheel nausea , and Delaware Punch and sheep 's eyes for the touching to begin again . And it did n't . Maybe I was throbbing visibly , because the chaperones got me and Everett onto the jump seats for the return trip , where there was n't even a chance for my skirt to brush his trousers  --  let alone for aching shoulder and thigh to be assuaged by some more pressure . Neither of us would have toleratedthe idea of a good-by kiss on our first date . That meant business , and though I , at least , intended business ( by which I meant courtship and marriage ) , a nice couple knew that certain formalities should be observed before there were any binding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange what I felt to be an especially meaningful handclasp , soft but strong , moral but lingering , as we parted on the dorm steps . I felt it all night long . So there I was . Blinded ( perhaps ) to Everett 's real charms by the chance of his having declared himself first . Scornful of most of his attitudes and opinions . But bound to him . Determinedto bind him to me by every device I imagined a sentimentaland conventional boy would find irresistible . I was n't much of a trap , so I did n't think I could afford to be tender . Efficiency was my goal . What bound me to Everett ? Touch ? If it was that which I found so irresistible , why did it never occur to me that the world was filled with touchers  --  that every manp102jack of them , unless paralyzed , had that ability . It never did . Because his touch was the first , were touch and Everett inextricablymixed in my mind ? And even more irresistibly in nerve ends and blood pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dreaming , God knows how much earlier , and eight years pass without so much as a hug from your Mother ( who loves with words not touch ) , let alone a nod from Prince Charming , and the flesh , ignorant as a leaf in the sun , trembles at dressmaker 's touches , or shoe clerk 's innocentfittings , what 's to be expected when a man 's hand and thigh ( that 's seventeen 's definition of Everett 's anatomy in the back seat of a Reo ) make purposeful advances ? What has been hinted at , the undisclosed secret , was all true . No wonder grownupswanted to keep it quiet . After one date I was madly in love with Everett . It was n't love at first sight , it 's true , but it certainly was love at first touch . The power of the first ! Something to be feared and dreaded . But how can it be feared or dreaded until its unsuspected power is known ? And how known without experiencing ? How can the unburned child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The power of the first . Does it exist for all ? Or only for those who come to a first after dreaming and deprivation ? Most feminineof traits , the opposite of the masculine impulse to explore and experiment , it binds the woman like bird lime onto the first twig where she settles . Poor Everett ! If I was a bird-limed bird , he was a bird-encumberedtwig , and encumbered with a bird who , if she had wings , was determined never to use them again . Thinking of these things I looked down on Everett sleeping soundly in Le Cid 's narrow bed . I felt sorry for him . There was a good deal I did n't understand about the two of us , but Blix 's speculations had set me to wondering . Had Everett , because of the chance of his " falling " for me , never really had a chance with me ? I got into bed in a repentant mood . I did n't try to get my fair share of the space , but curled myself gently in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees and around the hard littlep103burl of his bottom and draped my arms carefully over the soft bulge of his stomach ; and before I went to sleep I made a Christmasprayer : " God help me to be a better wife to Everett . " I prayed with eyes shut , and after I had finished praying I kept them shut ; but behind my closed lids I could n't sleep . I had resisted sleep when earlier I had longed for it . Now resistance had become my habit . I was awake to every sound , to every movement , and touch . The long day of work begun in Brenner , the anticipation , the evening of excitement , had sandpapered my senses . My own breathing disturbed me . My own arm was a spear against my ribs as I lay cramped , spoon-fashion in the narrow bed . The rubber-and-sweat smell of Le Cid 's sneakers , under the edge of the bed , filled my nose . I identified more slowly the smell of tobacco . There were no smokers in that Pilgrim household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sly . Somewhere close by Blix was smoking . I sat up slowly and carefully . This was n't necessary  --  Everett was a sound sleeper . I looked through the screen that formed the top half of the wall against which Le Cid 's cot was placed . Along the back-yard path , between the rhubarb plants and the guava bushes , with stops at old Bolivar 's cage , only half-visible under the come-and-go light of a moon crossed by traveling clouds , Blix was walking and smoking . In pajamas and bedroom slippers , she moved soundlessly . Why did n't I go to her ? I did get out of bed . I did lean , as silent as she , against the screen to watch her . I could smell not only her cigarette but also Mama 's Elmo , which she had been using . I knew she was troubled . Why else would she tramp a backyardpath and whisper to a sleeping bird on Christmas Eve ? So there is n't the excuse that I did n't understand that she was n't happy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known . " I knew . And I stayed where I was . My feeling , at the time , or the feeling I permitted myself to recognize , was , " Blix wants to be alone . " The best that can be said for me was that I was bone-tired ; the worst , that I was coldhearted . Perhaps it was something in between . In any case , whenever a decision not to act relieves usp104of effort , we had better ask ourselves if the purity of our motives has n't been stained by laziness . I watched . I sorrowed . I told myself , " Blix is upset , but she wants to be alone . " I got back into bed . I slept . Except for Pete I would have made the same mistake with Blix when she was here last July . And the circumstances being worse than they were on that past Christmas Eve , my memories now would be worse . Pete saved me from that . It was the next to last evening of Blix 's visit . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine o'clock , and , with daylight saving , scarcely dark . Towhees were still looking for crumbs on the terrace where we had eaten our supper . Cicadas were stitching their sewing-machine songs . A strand of saffron light still banded the western horizon . " We are all tired , " I , being tired , told myself . Across my desk all clay had passed the complaints and threats of that faction which believed that the republic might be saved by censoring the public 's reading . Blix was worn out , I thought . She had had a day of discomfort . She might have shrugged off the discomfort , but its possible meaning she could n't ignore . Pete did n't look tired , but then , he never does . Good golfers are built to withstand strain . Nerves and muscles alike are smoothly padded . Not all golfers are as ruddy as Pete or have eyes as calm . But by and large they 're not a haggard-looking lot . Competition does n't tire Pete . He enjoys the challenge of controllingposition by means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his day at the club had n't been abstract or sweet . The ladies ' team had been " hosting " the ladies from the Moon Valley Club . Pete does n't look forward to these tournaments . They are made up in about equal parts of fashion show , gossip , gourman/dizing , and golf . But he does n't complain . They 're a part of his job , and he likes his job . I do n't criticize these ladies either . It was once my ambition to be one of them . After I had finished my work at the university and landed my first job , I was lonely , and , after eight or nine hours behind a desk , muscle-bound . I was accustomed to hard physical work : chasing baby beeves , playing basketball , racing a stack of wheats to an impatient customer . In my toy apartment the chances for muscle stretching were n't much better than behind my desk . No wood to carry in , no fires to start , no farmhouse kitchen floor to scrub . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowling became popular . I had never played tennis . The only swimming pool in town was inside a steamy YWCA . I was a good softball player , but the softball teams were made up of tough seventeen-year-olds , and at twenty-six I was , to them , in a class with their mothers . I decided to take up golf . It seemed to me to be a sedate game , suited to my years . Nevertheless I was shamefaced buying clubs . Golf in Brenner had been considered ridiculous . If there were any players in Brenner , I did n't know them . Something was thought to be wrong with grown men and women who would walk up hill and down dale hitting a little white ball with a stick . It was the up-hill-and-down-dale bit that appealed to me . I would have fine walks in the late afternoons across what was , even though called " a golf course , " a nice traffic-free expanse of rolling hillocks . The ball would be the least of my worries . The ball , as it turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there , and because it was there I wanted to hit it , and in the right direction and with power . Power I could manage . I could drive hard and with fair accuracy . But once on the green , that little white eye in the center stared me down . Near misses counted nothing . Near , close , clinging to the lip : worthless ! It had to be in , dead center , and smack to the bottom . Faced with that requirement I blew up . I thoughtp106about giving up golf as played by others . Someone long ago had made up these rules to suit his game . Why not some rules to suit my game ? Disregard the putt . On the green and away again with a lashing drive . The next step , I suppose , would have included further rules to suit my game . It would have permitted ball shifting , landscapealtering , and a personal system of scoring . At this point Pete took charge of my nongame . I had noticed him , of course . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home course . I thought from his looks that he was Irish . He was Portuguese , as Portuguese goes in this country . Some great-great-grandfather had had a Portuguese name . Pete 's mother 's name was Ross . I admired his powerful lazy-looking strokes . I envied , though I would n't admit it , the players who laughed and talked with him . And of course I avoided him . Not because I had fallen in love with him , but because I was ashamed of my game . And in those years I was ashamed of myself , too . I was a failed wife and technical spinster . In my family divorcees were thought to be wicked , and spinsters , while morally untainted , were failed women . So there I was . And a flop at golf , too . I 'll never forget the first time Pete spoke to me . Nor what he said . It was a typical Central Valley steamy September afternoon . I had arrived at the number-three hole after two miraculous drives . I thought my luck must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that its heroes must reach the heights before they fail . The drama is more poignant that way . Who suffers over the losses of those who have nothing to lose ? I was no Greek hero . Surely my success off the green would n't have to be paid for by failure in putting . Someone was sitting on the bench under the acacias , by the drinking fountain , someone who could see me . I had had to train myself to ignore onlookers  --  and I kept my eyes , as advised , on the ball . Besides , I really hoped that this time I would n't fail . I failed.  |p107After  boggling around and ending up after four or five putts farther away from the pin than when I had started , I gave up . I did n't throw my putter or kick the ball or dig up the green . I did cry . Silently , of course , and with my back to my audience . My shoulders did n't heave . From the back I would be judged , I thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rosy-tipped out of the blue of their long shadows . I was admiring them , they in their shadows , I in my tears . I did n't hear Pete until he spoke . He 's still very quiet . Why is it that big men are quiet , and that little men go through the world the center of a continuous clatter ? Pete said , " Do n't cry , kiddie . It 's only a game . " I 've asked him how he knew I was crying . " I looked at you . Tears were running down your cheeks . " " You could n't tell that from behind me . " " From behind you , I thought you had possibly had a stroke . " " I had had about twenty strokes . That was my trouble . " It was that " kiddie " that really melted me . I did n't give a big sob , or run over and bury my head in his shoulder . But I 'd never been a " kiddie " to anyone before . Or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids . " I was the substitute mother . Kid ? Kiddie ? Child ? Youngster ? Little one ? Baby ? Babe ? I do n't think so . And I was big , too , remember , in addition to being the oldest . And now a bona fide divorcee and artificial spinster , to boot . " Do n't cry , kiddie . " I think those are the most beautiful words I ever heard in my life . Full of pity . I know there are those who resent being pitied . Not I. I think the human condition is pitiful . The most beautiful line in the Bible to me is not " Lie down in green pastures , " or " Underneath me are the everlasting wings , " but " Like as a father pitieth his child . " Pete was my age , twenty-six , when he spoke those words ; but compassion comes early to some . I tried to answer him without embarrassing him with more tears . " I know it 's a game , " I agreed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | " Maybe you 're trying too hard . " I thought he meant with too much physical force . " I use psychology , " I told him , wanting him to think that I was potentially , at least , a brainy player . " Like how ? " " I ca n't putt . You saw that . So I tell myself , ' If you do n't sink this ball your enemies will shoot and kill your entire family . ' That really ought to motivate me . Ought n't it ? " " Depends on whether you want your family shot and killed or not . " This shocked me . " Of course I do n't . " " You 'd better plan to save them by some other means than putting , then . By the way , who are your enemies ? " " No one . Anonymous . Made up to spur me on . " " Your family anonymous , too ? " " Oh , no ! Father , mother , three brothers , and a sister . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marvels but Pete asked one more question . " Anonymous husband ? " He was looking at my wedding ring , which I had continued to wear . Partly because I did n't want to be thought an old maid . Partly because " unmarry " does n't take place in the words of a document any more than " marry " takes place there . I did n't feel unmarried . Perhaps those who have never been properly married never feel properly unmarried either . There is too little change in their life . " No . Divorced . My husband divorced me , " I added , feeling it unfair to let him think that Everett was a man of reprehensiblehabits . " Why do n't you take your ring off then ? You still carrying a torch ? " " No . " I decided to tell the truth . Not the whole truth , but an authentic piece of it . " I do n't like people to think I 'm a spinster  --  at my age . " " I like to think you 're a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you to think I 'm a bachelor . It 's true , too . Never been married . "  |p109This  was a pretty fast conversation for me . Pretty real , too . I did n't know what to say next , so , fortunately , said nothing . Pete said , " How about a lesson in putting ? " There was nothing I wanted less . I would be knocking that ball around the cup until the stars came out . I never could learn by watching someone else . But Pete 's idea of a lesson in putting was n't mine . He took my putter and lifted my ball off the green and to hell and gone  --  somewhere in the general direction of the Feather River . " You could do that all right , could n't you ? " " Of course . It 's all I can do . But that 's not golf , is it ? " " It 's psychology . And you believe in psychology , do n't you ? " I believed in mine . I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said next was probably psychology , too . Even though he did n't label it . " Are n't you thirsty ? " I was . Parched . Dehydrated by heat and all that miserable putting . Salted by the brine of swallowed tears . Feverish with conversation . " Let 's go down to the clubhouse and have a drink . " I did n't drink . Not hard liquor . But at the minute Pete meant more to me than temperance . I said , " Yes . " When we get to the clubhouse , I thought , I can ask for lemonade or root beer . At the clubhouse Pete said , " Something long and cool ? " I said , " Yes . " If it turned out to be alcoholic , I could take a sip or two for politeness 's sake and ignore the rest . What the drink was , I do n't know . A Tom Collins , probably , pretty , stained with the colors of floating fruit . I sipped clear to the bottom of the glass . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned at the movies : schoolmarms , after a few drinks , took off their spectacles and danced on table tops ; country girls went willingly to meet a fate worse than death in a back room . I was no movie drinker . I became calmer and calmer . My hands stopped trembling . My throat relaxed . I no longer thought of myself as a failed wife and impossible putter . My family 's wellbeingdid n't hinge upon my putting  --  or my anything else . I hadp110no enemies . I was n't married . Golf was a game , and I was a lucky spinster . While Pete was at the bar reordering , I took off my ring . When he came back , he noticed . We were never engaged . I never " fell in love " with him . We did n't talk about marriage . We spent more and more time together ; and the time apart was spent in soliloquies which rehearsedwhat we would say when next we met . We had a marriage of convenience . It would be more convenient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence , the emotional waste of parting , and the irritation of continual transportation between our separated homes . We got a license to live together . Pete delighted me . Just to see him and listen to him . The only other person who had affected me in this way was Blix . Pete and I had n't the same tastes , any more than Blix and I. Pete 's a hunter , which I could n't and still ca n't understand . But he is a reader , too , which seems as natural as breathing to me . I 've heard Pete tell friends , " Some men are attracted to women who are stacked . I fell for Tass because she carried the keys to the stacks . " Pete 's too kind to say something like that except that he knows someone is pretty sure to come to my defense by saying , " It was n't necessarily an either-or situation , was it , Peter , old boy ? " Pete always answers , " Speak for yourself , John . The books were what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book man , who last July saved me from another do-nothing memory with Blix . The evening when I , being tired , decided that Blix , too , was yearning for rest . Pete opened my eyes . " Do n't cry , kiddie " is only one string to Peter 's bow . The other is , " Woman , do n't give up . " Before undressing , I went down the hall to say good night to Blix . She was lying on top of her bed reading . At least holding a book in her hands . " How can you see to read ? " I asked . She had n't turned on her bedside lamp . The sun was down , and the little light left was additionally darkened by the bronzed leaves of the tall viburnum bush that shaded her west window.  | " I do n't want to read . Take this book away from me . It 's getting me down . " She 'd been down all day . She did n't talk about it , but she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book , opened , back to Pete 's and my room . Pete took the book from me . " Where 'd you get this ? " " Blix . " " Have you read it ? " It was Baldwin 's Another Country , and I had n't , then . But I had read about it . " Negroes and homosexuality , " I told Pete . " And suicide , " Pete said . " The best man among them kills himself . That 's where Blix is now . " Pete put the book on my dressing table , and I looked at him in the mirror . " Think it would be okay for me to go in to talk to Blix ? " " Sure . If you are n't too tired . " I was still sitting there on the dressing-table bench when Pete came back . " Okay , kiddie . Off with the shorts and into something for the big city . " " The big city ? I 'm half ready for bed . " " Bed 's later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 've had dinner ! " " Who mentioned dinner ? This is an evening for wine and women and dancing . " " Blix does n't feel like wining and dancing . " " It 's all she does feel like . You 've seen that closetful of clothes she brought up . And all we 've offered her is dinner at the club and pizza parlors with live music . " Blix herself came to the door . " Pete 's right , Tassie . I 'm nothing but a hypochondriac . Plus that damned book . The minute Pete said champagne and dancing I was cured . No one who gets cured by two words is very sick . " Pete , who was already in the bathroom shaving , stuck his head out . " Three words . Champagne , dancing , and San Francisco . "  | " Help me decide what to wear , " Blix said . It was like old times . I voted for an evening dress with a full skirt of smoky chiffon and a short sleeveless bolero covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world for women built like Blix , women with slender arms , narrow waists , and ample breasts . She wore gray satin pumps with buckles beaded in the same color and design as her bolero . " You still like buckles ? " " You started me on them and I 've never kicked the habit . " I did n't , last July , make the connection between Blix 's talking to Bolivar on Christmas morning and Blix reading Baldwin in midsummer twenty-five years later . Blix did n't know that I had seen her outside talking to Bolivar that Christmas Eve . She did n't know that the December evening was tied to the July evening by my reluctance on both occasions to do anything . But with an understanding beyond knowing , she had associated the two by way of the remembered buckles . That was the end of looking backward that evening . And there were no more forebodings about the future . The night was selfsufficient . I remember it as colors , the smoky grays and opals of Blix 's dress and shoes . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champagne bubble perhaps . Like those champagne bubbles in " Wings " which rose out of the rounded bedposts beforeBuddy Rogers 's intoxicated eyes . I remember it as sound , the foaming music and the muted leather-on-wood whisper of dancing and the subtly deepened and lightened voices of people whose purpose in being together is the present . Pete can dance with anyone . Blix can dance with anyone . Together they were perhaps too perfect to be noticed : a wave goes curling over ; long grass alternates silver and green in the wind ; the movement of candle flame gives the shadow of a bowl of roses an indoor life on the ceiling . Not much heed is paid such natural grace . Pete and Blix were like that ; but I paid them heed . I can dance with Pete , not as naturally as Blix . More like thep113surfer who goes sliding down the wave than the wave itself ; the element of failure is present . But with Pete I never fail . An evening blossoms , and its blooming can not be explained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our living room , with exactlythe same music , recorded , and the same amount of champagne , and wearing the same clothes , the same evening ? Impossible . Though to say that we had to drink , talk , and dance in public to achieve such happiness seems to admit the need for an audience . No , not that need . The same need that a partnering in dancing satisfies : an enhancement by sharing . We did n't start home until after two . It was a night without fog , the stars as bright as the traffic lights . We were all in the front seat . Blix said then , without explanation , what she was to enlarge upon three months later . " If there were n't any more , if this evening were all , it would just about be worth it , would n't it ? " I was too happy and sleepy to answer . I squeezed Blix 's hand to tell her I heard and agreed.  |p114The  day after Christmas finishes Christmas without outside help , but if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That great dusty rocking wind is obviously stronger than Christmas trees and their tinsel . It sends Christmas paper , printed with holly wreaths and Santa Clauses , just as high as butcher paper or weekoldBaranca Bulletins .

It reminds humans how rickety is the scaffolding of their special days . All days are alike to the wind . The better the day , the better the deed , with it , too .

And been disappointed ? So that now even ordinary undertakings filled me with foreboding . I packed for the trips from Brenner to Baranca , which I loved so much , with heavy heart . Better leave well enough alone . Find fault with the present and the future will show you what real suffering is . Mama 's making the date for me absolved me from blame . I was n't tempting fate . I was n't expressing any dissatisfaction with the present or hope for the future . I was a good girl doing what my mother wished . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Brinsley had his own clinic , with two other doctors , I think , and his own hospital . This small-town medical center was lodged in a white stucco mansion which its original owners , in the hard times of the thirties , had found too expensive to keep up . It was called the " Baranca Sanitarium , " and its residential aspect , white stucco urns with trailing geraniums , a fountain withoutwater , an iron stag , whitewashed , made it appear a wolf in sheep 's clothing . Bad things went on in there , and you knew it : amputations , births that went wrong , deaths from poison , selfadministered ; and all somehow worse because they happened in what had the appearance of a home . A good plain straightforward hospital that looked like a hospital would have been more reassuring . Dr. Brinsley had something of this same deceptive appearance , though I knew and liked him . He looked like a hardware merchant , a good solid man with red hair going gray and a thick bristling scrub-brush mustache .

So Brinsleydid n't frighten me , though no one in his right senses could enjoy the medicinal smell of the sanitarium or the sight of Dr. Brinsley 's nurse , Miss Irene Irby . Miss Irby was a dark woman with red lips , black Gorgon curls twisting out from under her cap , and the ability to wear a starched white uniform like the skin of a diamondback rattler .

I could n't take my eyes off that apparatus , but Dr. Brinsley , easy in its presence , put me in a chair and himself mounted the black leather mechanism , sitting on it jauntily , like a lady riding sidesaddle.  | " Well now , Tassie , how long 's this side ache been bothering you ? " It seemed like forever . " It started two or three years ago , I think . " " Why have n't you done anything about it ? " " I thought it would go away . " " For two or three years you thought it would go away ? " Dr. Brinsley , who was a Sunday-school teacher in the White Temple Presbyterian Church , dismounted , and said prayerfully , " My God , my God . Hell and damnation , girl . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go to college for ? Why , people had more sense than you have in the Dark Ages . Old ladies back in the Kentucky hills who ca n't read cat from dog have got more sense than you when it comes to taking care of their bodies . And your body is you . Do n't you know that ? It 's not something you own , like a breadboard or a dish mop , and can get along without . It 's you . And perishable . Did n't that ever occur to you ? " It had . I thought about death quite a lot . " Get up here , " said Dr. Brinsley , and he proceeded so directly and angrily , there was no room for embarrassment . " Do you use douches ? " " I do n't use any now . " " What have you used ? I did n't like to say . " Tell me . " " Vinegar and cold water . " " Lots of vinegar and icy-cold water ? " I said yes with my eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes again . " If you did n't know any better than that , why did n't your husband do something ? " Everett had said that it was too embarrassing to go to a drugstore and ask for the things men used . Besides , it was n't natural . But I was afraid to tell Dr. Brinsley this . I knew he would n't approve . I said , " I do n't know . " " All right , " he said . " You do n't need to tell me . Now you raise your head a little and look down here in the lower left part of your abdomen . Do you see that ? "  |p118Dr  . Brinsley was outlining with the fingers of two hands a mound , too large for him to completely circle . " Did n't you ever see that before ? " " I never noticed it . " " Do n't you ever look at your body ? " I started to say , " It 's not much to look at , " decided that sounded as if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That , " said Dr. Brinsley , making a circle around the protuberancewith one disdainful finger , " is an ovarian cyst . Or possiblya uterine tumor . It 's already the size of a grapefruit . You invited it with those douches . You encouraged it with your neglect . And now , by God , I 've got to harvest it . " " What do you mean , harvest ? " " Operate . Cut it out . In one piece , if I can . Which wo n't be easy . Get it out of you , in any case , the best way I can . " " When ? " " The sooner the better . Sometime this week , certainly . " The sun had gone down when I left the sanitarium , but it was n't dark yet . An afterglow , murky red in the dust-filled sky , smoldered in the west . The wind was still blowing , cold and gusty . You could feel the grit on your teeth if you forgot and breathed through your mouth . I walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for I had never been sick and did not expect to put up with any long-drawn-out period in bed as others , more inclined to invalidism than I , might do . But I was bewilderedand angry . Whatever Dr. Brinsley might think , I understood quite well that my body was me . And this being true , what did my body mean , or that part of it in my lower left abdomen mean , turning against me ? It was civil war , was n't it ? And if I could n't depend upon my own body to be for me , to wish me well , upon what or whom could I depend ? Now that Dr. Brinsley had shown me where " my growth " was , I could feel with my own hand its rise and fall as I walked . I am a lopsided non-mother-to-be , I thought : askew , awry , askance . I am pregnant with possible death . There is something wrong withp119me . I am headed in the opposite direction from other girls my age . The organ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had never occurred to me when I was married that I would n't have children . I 'd had a list of names since I was sixteen , and they were worse than mother 's : Reverdy , Chapel , Satsuma , Concordia , Molloy . They in themselves were enough to scare off the stork without recourse to icy-acid douches suffered through in cold privies . But I did n't know that ; and when Everett , after I began to work and felt that bookkeeping and pregnancy were irreconcilable , told me that he would n't think of going into a drugstore and making any inquiries , I remembered the old wives ' tale : so by way of inseminations , sour and cold , I had conceived , not Satsuma or Concordia , but Growth . I , too , had , like other young women of twenty-four , my bulge , my by-product of marriageand sex : but birth and baby were not to be the harvest . As I neared home I began to hurry , anticipating the comfort and sympathy I would receive there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my news . Mother , though shocked and sympathetic , would joke . " Best days of my life were spent resting in a hospital bed . A tumor ? Nothing to it . Mrs. Thornwaitehad one , and Dr. Brinsley snipped it off like a grape . Just think , petty , those side aches are a thing of the past . " Oh , I would be welcomed , reassured , jollied , comforted , kidded , petted , and fed ! I hurried past windows through which I could see the still-lighted Christmas trees , toward home with its now empty laundry basket . Everyone knew where I had been : to the doctor to see about my side ache . I pictured them as waiting apprehensively for the news . " Why does n't she come ? " " I hope it 's not serious . " " Poor girl , what an ordeal this must have been for her . " I came in prepared to make my news easy for everyone , to spare them , to suffer silently . I came in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Out , I learned later , with Vurl . Le Cid was n't there : at the library . Marmion was n't there : at Olive 's . Father , Mother , and Blackie were home , in the living room , huddled about the radio.  |p120'The  body of Marian Parsons has been found in an irrigation ditch southwest of the town of Carlsbad , in San Diego County . Her kidnapper and killer has not yet been apprehended . There are reports that he has been seen . . . " Mother , " I said , " I had my examination . " " Just a minute , petty , " Mother said . " They think they 've found the murderer . " They had n't , but they did have endless reports . Blackie , not very excited by rape , came over to the sofa , hoisted up Beanie , and sat down with the dog between us . We both patted Beanie , and sometimes , our pats coinciding , we patted each other . I finally got to tell my news . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many other words , it seemed less than world-shaking . I was going to have an operation . But thousands of people had no doubt received that same news that very day . Mother was as comforting and funny as I had expected her to be . Blackie said , " I 'll come to see you every day . " Everett arrived and said , " This doctor may not know what he 's talking about . A lot of doctors are hipped on making operations . This is nothing to get upset about . " I waited up , hoping that Blix would be home early . She did n't come , and I thought , We live and die alone . After Everett had personally checked with Dr. Brinsley , the operation was scheduled for Friday morning at eight . Dr. Brinsleyconvinced him that I had not been exaggerating , and that postponement might be fatal . Everett said he very much doubted this , but if I wanted to go along with Brinsley 's verdict , it was all right with him . Everett left Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take care of our milk and egg customers . He would n't be back to Baranca until after the operation ; on what day , he would n't know until he found someone to do his work . This was n't my idea of love and marriage : wife onp121operating table while husband takes care of livestock . But a good many of my ideas were undergoing change in this period ; and I recognized , as well as Everett , that with the cost of the operation added to my loss of salary through sickness , someone had better be bringing in some money . Once the decision to have the operation was made , I did n't have too many apprehensions . Decision itself was what upset me  --  and first Mother and now Dr. Brinsley had taken this out of my hands . As a toothache lets up before a dentist date , so my side ache let up before the date of my operation . I had two or three delectable days . No early rising . No books that would n't balance . No eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No milk to skim , and cream bottles to fill . No fires to start , meals to cook , dishes to wash . If this was invalidism , give me more of it . Only Blix , Blackie , and I were at home . Marmion had gone back to school . Le Cid was in Balboa visiting friends . Mother , who enjoyedcooking , and had in me and Blackie two of her most enthusiasticfans , outdid herself . A big pot of navy beans with dumplings as light as feathers floating on top . Pineapple upsidedowncake . Cottage pudding , which was a layer cake held together by a thick rich chocolate sauce . Pot roast with browned potatoes and gravy that looked as chocolatey as the sauce that covered the layer cake . When we were n't talking and eating , Blix and I went down to the Baranca library for books . We were permitted four books to a card , and by pooling the family cards we got out twenty-eight books . Enough to see me through at least the first week of hospital life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in November , T. E. Shaw 's translation of the Odyssey , Scouting on Two Continents , Nazi Means War , Amiel 's Journal , Elinor Wylie'sCollected Poems , Tender Is the Night , Book of Talbot , Giles 's History of Chinese Literature , Eimi , Foot-loose in the British Isles , Testament of Youth , Winner Take Nothing , The Shape of Things to Come . We really reaped that library . Blix had no bookworm blood in her , but she was patient with mep122and enthusiastic on her own about some of Elinor Wylie 's poems . " My love came up from Barnegat " I remember was one of them . We came home from the library at dusk : the dying Santa Ana blew our hair in our eyes , but we were too laden with books to do anything about it . We walked , half-blinded , laughing with passers-by at our plight . " Let 's get someone to push the hair out of our eyes , " I said to Blix . " Let 's ask someone to carry our books , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own hair . " We walked under the grape arbor , toward the lighted kitchen , laughing and talking . It was like a continuation of old times , before Blix 's heart was stolen ( if it was ) and my interior ( surely ) damaged . And why should n't it be ? Damage and breakagewere recent . I was separated by only four years , and Blix by one , from coming into this kitchen every evening at dusk , with Mother busy at the stove . At that time , it was more natural for us to return to the life we had known than to move ahead into the strangeness of operations , and the miseries of love . Mother was where we usually ( unless she had a sick headache ) found her at this hour . Sitting on her tall stool , rickety , in spite of the fact that Father had steadied its legs in a lasso of baling wire , stirring something on the stove . It was gravy again , this evening , made from the grease fried out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she made pies ) big raisin pies , seeping brown juice , were cooling on the drainboard . Blix and I headed for the living-room sofa , threw down our books , and exercised our aching arms . Blackie immediately grabbed Scoutingon Two Continents from the pile and , when we went back to the kitchen , followed us like a sleepwalker , his nose already between the pages . Something was wrong with Mother . I could see it in the slopep123of her shoulders , in the lackadaisical way she was stirring the gravy . It showed , whatever was troubling her , in the neat and careful setting of the table . She had set that table with rigid arms , without trust or spontaneity . When Mother was in good heart , she threw things at the table , too absorbed in life to waste time arranging china and cutlery . " How do you feel , Mother ? " " Why , with my fingers , petty , " Mother said , imitating her usual manner and avoiding a downright lie . Whatever she did with words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dreadful trouble . But until after dinner , when Blix left for a girls ' bridge party , Mother kept up her pretense that she knew no feelings except those her fingers gave her . Dinner over and Blix gone , she did something unusual . She set Blackie to washing dishes ; she snatched Scouting on Two Continentsaway from him and , when he set up his usual howl , gave him a smack that surprised him into silence . " Now , Basil Murphy , " she said , " you light right into those dishes . Your sister 's a sick girl . " Basil gave another hiccup . " There 's not a thing wrong with you hard work wo n't cure , Basil . Dishwashing 's too easy to turn the trick , but it 's a start in the right direction . " She shut the door firmly on Blackie and , Burnham 's book in hand , led me past Father and the evening paper through the living room and into Blix 's room . She shut that door firmly , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave her room the look of a study ) , leaned forward , and rested her face in her hands . " Mother , are you sick ? " " I 'm sick at heart , " she said . This is a sickness you ca n't inquire about . You ca n't say , or I could n't , at least , " What makes you sick at heart ? " Not to Mother . It 's not like physical sickness . Probe , examine , and all symptoms of heartsickness may be hidden . All I could do was to stand ready and to wonder : Why was she sick at heart ? She was concerned about my operation , of course . But it didn'tp124make her " sick at heart . " Her children did n't have serious diseases , and if by some mischance they did , they threw them off in no time . It was a mechanical affair , like a vapor lock in the Durant , mended in no time and better than before , no doubt . So it was n't my operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet hen , " " drove her crazy , " " provoked her , " but he never made her " sick at heart . " Blackie could make her sick at heart all right ; but it was n't Blackie this time , or she 'd have him out in his room , instead of me in Blix 's room . We might all be sick at heart if we knew all there was to know about Le Cid . But we did n't and we never would . Le Cid lived his own life . He was smart enough to keep it under cover and strong enough to have no need to talk it over . Le Cid lived with us like a man from another planet . Our weaknesses were n't his , and maybe not our sins either . Anyway he was never going to make Mother sick at heart . Marmion ? Was Marmion making Mother sick at heart ? I did n't think he could . That left Blix . I think I had known it from the beginning . It had always been Blix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out something " bad " about Blix . Now I , too , felt sick at heart  --  for Blix , for myself . Suspicion , condemnation , berating , suffering . . . my stomach began to contract . Had n't Blix gone through enough ? I pulled out the chair from Blix 's dressing table-desk and sat down . There was nothing to do but wait . The room was so Blixat-twenty : chaos . Clean clothes tried on and discarded . Dirty clothes stepped out of and left lying . Shoes , magazines , coffee cups , half a sandwich . The room of a girl interested in clothes and boys . The room of a girl who did not live there , but only made preparations there , to live elsewhere . A complete contrast to my room as a girl . I had lived in my room as a girl . I did my preparing outside , seeing and hearing , and came back to my orderly room to try to give order to what I had experienced . My room was always as neat as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I did n't then know . I began top125straighten out Blix 's desk : get school papers sorted from magazines , bobby pins from paper clips . The noise I made roused Mother . She looked up at me . " I want you to see something , " she said . She opened the door of Blix 's closet . " Come here , " she said . Blix 's closet was her room , only more so . How could she walk out of such confusion so immaculate herself ? Out of my bandbox room I walked all crooked seams and pinned-up straps and flying hair . Out of her mare 's nest Blix emerged a fashion model . She was more unselfish than I. I cared about what I saw , not what others saw . ( This is n't quite true . I cared , but Blix said I did n't care enough . ) Mother paid no attention to the things she had to step on to get to the hangers that held Blix 's clothes . She pushed aside clothes until three garments hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's big football sweater . Other things hung in a ramshackleany which way . These three were properly centered and securely buttoned . Mother unbuttoned one at a time . Underneatheach hung a pocketbook . Then , one at a time , she opened the purses . " Look , " she said . I stepped in closer so that I could . I do n't know what I expected to find ; something of the kind I did find , I think : a kit for terminating pregnancy . It was n't called that , of course , but even I , ignorant vinegar doucher , understood the purposes of castor oil , salts , viburnum compound , hot baths , and dilation . I understood Mother 's " sick at heart . " I was sick there , or somewherenear there , in diaphragm and throat . Oh Blix ! That she had had this to bear , besides the knowledge , surely , of Vurl 's roving eye . Taking the stuff . Wondering . Worrying . Knowing that Mother would rather have her in her grave . Talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me enough . This at Christmastime , and giving no sign . Hair curled . Eyebrows arched . Carrying the books . Laughing in the wind . Mother closed every pocketbook carefully , carefully rebuttoned all the camouflaging garments , carefully realigned the coat hang/ers . Then she retrod the once-trod-on clothes , and I , following her , closed the closet door behind her . " Blix must never know that I know , " she said . This was fine with me . If Blix had gone to all this trouble to keep her trouble secret , why hurt her by telling her we had , behind her back , spied it out ? " I think the stuff worked , " Mother said . " I think she 's all right now . Might be she did n't even need it and was late a day or two and got scared . " " How would she get it ? How would she know . . . " " Vurl , " Mother said . The letters of his name were too slippery to spit out , but Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's had more than one use for stuff like that or I miss my doubt . " I thought of Everett . Mother seemingly did so , too . " You do n't know how lucky you are with a good husband . Tasmania , Blix must never know I know . She must have somebody left she wants to prove herself for . She must still think her father and mother believe in her . " " Well , do n't you ? " Mother did n't answer me . Instead , she said , " Someone must talk to her . Someone must point out to that poor girl where actionslike this will lead . Someone must tell her to cut that Vurl right out of her life , never see him again . Oh , petty , " Mother said , " Blix looks up to you so . She told me just the other day you were her ideal . You are the one to talk to her . She 'll listen to you . " I said , " How do I know anything about  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . what she 's got hidden . " " How did I stumble ? I do n't wear Blix 's things . " " I do n't know , " Mother said . " You 'll think of something . You always do . But someone she believes in must tell her how wrong . . . how low-down . . . someone she knows loves her . " " I ca n't do it . " " There 's more in it than comes to the eye . This happening at this time , just as you go to the hospital . It can be your last word to Blix  --  before you go under the knife , I mean . It will havep127extra meaning to her coming then . I 'm not going to say God gave you this misery so what you say to Blix will have added weight . But it has worked out that way . It 's come at a time when she 'll listen twice as hard . Want to please you twice as much . Oh , petty , you 'll do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't say anything . I could n't say " no " to Mother . Or Blix . And I could n't say " yes " either . Mother said , " I 've put too much on you from the beginning . I 've asked too much of you . Made you a second mother to the kids . What else could I do , sick half the time ? Do n't think I 've forgotten your trouble . I make light of it , but I know an operation'sno joke . But you 're not in any real pain now . . . . And would n't you like to think this sickness is n't pure waste ? " I was weakening , speaking of the conditions now under which I would or would not talk to Blix . I did n't know it . But Mother did . " I know what you 're thinking , Tasmania . You feel like you 'd be using your operation somehow if you asked Blix to throw away that stuff and to stop seeing Vurl . But you ca n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the chance of what 's happening to you now keep you from helping Blix ? Do n't you want to help your sister ? Do you want her to go through all this again ? She leans on you , Tassie . She looks up to you . Someone ought to talk to her . And you should n't make her suffer just because you think that it 's not something-or-other , to speak up for the right , when you 're on the verge of an operation . " " But that 's one of the reasons you wanted me . . . " " I said that Blix would pay more attention to you than usual , just now ... and that 's a fact . But it 's not a fact that should keep you from talking to her . There 's more at stake here than your dignity . " I could perhaps have said " no " if Mother had shown any signs of her old-time fury and hatred . She did n't . . . nothing but distress . " What if it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think she 's safe .. now . I think so . But she wo n't alwaysp128be so lucky , Tassie . . . . Do you want her to go through this again ? " Mother 's great blue-green eyes were clouded . Her lips were colorless . The room was chilly ; in spite of this her forehead was beaded with sweat . I could see the beat of her heart in the hollowsof her temples . She sat down once again on Blix 's bed and wrapped her arms in her apron . She was tired . While Blix and I had been chanting " My love came down from Barnegat , " and tossing our windswept locks , she had been perched on her balingwired , rickety stool , frying the pork chops , stirring the gravy : she had had her dreams , too . Not only virgin daughters and grandsonsborn in wedlock , but her early dreams : of a fair world , beyond the lace curtains ( though she was n't willing to give them up either ) , a fair world , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight and loving-kindness flowered thick as calla lilies along the irrigation ditches . Oh , I said " yes , " to her . It was foregone . I said " yes " because I could n't say " no . " Maybe talking to Blix would or would not help her . But there was no doubt that Mother would be helped by a " yes . " The sweat dried on her forehead the minute I said " yes . " Her eyes cleared . " Oh , petty , " she said , " I knew I could count on you . " I said " yes " to Mother but I could n't say a word to Blix . I could n't make a beginning . Say , " By sheerest chance I stumbled upon your anti-pregnancy kit , under your coats , inside your purses in the closet . " Mother arranged opportunities , encouraged talk , deplored postponement . Finally , I had an idea . It was something I wanted to do anyway , so I had no trouble convincing myself that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the Normal Hill Apartments for the night , " I suggested to Blix . " You take your car and I 'll pay the expenses . " Blix agreed . She thought I wanted one last look at the city before my operation . She had never seen the Normal Hill Apartments , and the Biltmore or the Mayflower was nearer her idea of a fling in Los Angeles . I did n't have the money for such hotels , which she knew , but besides being cheap ( the rooms were only a dollar ) , the Normal Hill Apartments excited me . They were like the ruins of a temple carved in the sandstone cliff overhanginga desert valley . They were to some degree actual ruins . They did to some degree overhang the street below . When we finally reached the Apartments , I watched Blix fearfully . I wanted her to like them . They were my own discovery ; I felt it was , in some way difficult to explain , strange and beautiful . The building was nearing its end ; that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been no attempt to disguise what it had been , a rooming house for students who had gone to the old L.A. Normal . The Normal had been torn down ; girls preparing to be teachers went to U.C.L.A. , and the Apartments now housed shoe salesmen , librarians , old ladies . What the buildinglooked like was a big broken-down bunkhouse of the kind the great , but disappearing ranches , Leffingwell , Bastanchury , Irvine , still maintained . You expected to see horse troughs , a dinner bell suspended from one of the olive trees . The olive trees told you what the place had been before it had become a part of the city . " What do you think of it ? " I asked Blix anxiously . She liked it . I could see that at once . Not crazy about it , maybe , but captivated by its strangeness . I knew which room I wanted , 215 . I had been there twice before . We carried our own suitcases ( there were no elevators or bellboys ) down a long corridor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched . And approved . At the Biltmore or the Ambassador we would n't have cut much of a swatch . Here we were pretty modish . We responded with our special somethings , our emotion-clogged voices , our knee-action gaits . A man older than Father asked Blix if he could carry herp130suitcase . A woman as old as Mother complimented me on my handbag . We entered our room like actors coming off stage , a pleased audience behind us . Blix liked the room . How could she not ? It was large , clean , and threadbare , sparsely furnished : a Congoleumrug on the floor , its original pattern blurred to a soft mulberrystain . A double bed : the mattress a pad , the springs , chicken wire , but clean , with bedspread pulled as taut as an ironing-board cover . It was pure bleakness ; it was sparseness , unrelieved , an abstractionyou could walk about in . People now travel hundreds of miles to find these qualities in the desert . We had them after fifteen miles , in the heart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D' you like it ? " I asked Blix again . " I would n't want to settle down for life here . " We stepped to the window together . We may not have had the same thought but we spoke the same words . " Well , here we are . " There we were , all right . Ailing in the same areas . Harmed by what should have healed . Dismayed by what should have delighted . Oh , what had happened to us ? Where were the two highsteppers ? The throb-throated talkers ? The hair-tossers ? The poetry-quoters ? The wind-lovers ? Were we demolished ? Or only temporarily shattered and capable of being patched together again ? Blix wanted to try patching . " Let 's eat at a nice place . " We did n't know , or I did n't know , any " nice " places . The only " nice " place I knew was Clifton 's , a cafeteria with a waterfall , artificial stones , but real water and real ferns . Blix hooted at this idea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cafeteria , even if it has a real ocean with real waves . I 'm going some place where they have candles . And serve wine . " " Wine ! Do you know where to find a place like that ? " " Yes , I do . " " Have you ever drunk wine ? " " What do you think I drink when I go out ? "  |p13Actually  , I had never thought about it . But if I had , I would have supposed water . When I did n't answer , Blix said , " Did John Everett make you take the pledge ? " " Of course not , " I answered , nettled . What kind of a milksop did Blix think I was ? " You find the place , " I bragged , " and I 'll drink as much as you do . It 's a perfect idea . Eat , drink , and be merry , for tomorrow we die . " " Okay , " said Blix . " I 'll be ready to go in an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had often watched the process , how Blix could spend so much time " getting ready . " What was there to " getting ready " besides wash , comb , dress , put on make-up ? And with Blix , washing , as Mother often said , was a short horse and soon curried . Taking all the pains in the world , fifteen minutes was all I could manage to spend on " getting ready . " Once , disgusted with the uncertain blurry job I had done with lipstick on my mouth , Blix went to work on me with her brush and lipstick . She drew a perfect mouth , and filled it in with sure strokes . She stood back , looked at it , wiped it off . " For you , your Way is better . " " In other words , a perfect mouth needs a perfect face . " Blix disagreed . " Who 'd paint a door on a tree ? " This was n't clear ; but I did n't want it explained . Blix 's slowness in dressing often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . While she dressed , I would have time to visit the new library above which the Normal Hill Apartments rose . I had , as usual , two purposes in the library that afternoon : discovery of books I did n't know existed , and the acquirement , if possible , of a specific book . I was an official card-carrying Los Angeles Public Library patron and I knew my rights : how manyp132books , for how long , and so forth . I did n't expect much help , and , after decades in public libraries , did n't need much . The book I wanted was the recently published diaries of the brothers Goncourt . I wanted it because the brothers were literary and the book was a diary . In a diary , I was convinced , I got the writer 's lifeblood warm from the vein . Pepys and Dorothy Wordsworth , Thoreau and Katherine Mansfield , set my teeth to chattering with excitement . None but the lonely heart , they say , keeps a diary . None but a lonelier heart , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak to ; the diary reader has no one who speaks to him . The diary writer is at least talking to himself . The diary reader is listening to a man talking to himself . The catalogue showed that the library owned a copy of the Goncourt diary . I scanned both ways from the Goncourt 's ; scanned backward into the B 's , the Brontes , and finally reached Mrs. Gaskell 's life of Charlotte . I knew the Brontes , of course , but not Mrs. Gaskell . I took the book down . I began to read . I forgot all about the Goncourt brothers . I forgot my sister . I turned pages , picked up sentences . I left California for Yorkshire . I read : " Weary with a hard day 's work . . . a stormy evening ... the wind is uttering a continual moaning sound . . . a household custom among these girls . . . to sew ' til nine o'clock at night . At that hour they put away their work and begin to pace the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . often with candles extinguished . . . they talked over past cares and troubles . . . this was the time for discussing together the plots of their novels . Emily , that free wild untamable spirit , never happy or well but on the moors . . . Branwell resolved on standing up to die . . . Emily , stronger than a man . . . simpler than a child . . . Keeper walked alongside the mourners . . . the day is windy , cloudy and stormy . . . I am trying to hope . " I walked to a table , reading , pulled out a chair , reading , and , still reading , sat down . Though I was no longer aware of reading or of words . I was living the life of the Brontes , high on the moors of Yorkshire in a house overlooking a graveyard ; a house floored with flagstones and buffeted by winds . Cold flagstones ,  |p133bitter  winds , damp sheets , pale curates , sickness unending : nothing to live on but the sweep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warmth of the imagination . Weary , resisting , hoping . The day 's work : bread kneaded , stockings mended , floors scrubbed , fires kept up . At night the pacing , the books and pens . The whisper of snow . The rustle of something neither snow nor wind . Oh , wild Decembers . Like Charlotte , I loved Emily . Strong as a child , simple as a man . Or was it the other way around ? Take five years from me , Emily , I urged . I give you five years from my life . Blix did n't even know I was half an hour late . Nor did she suggest that I try any improvements in make-up or dress . " When you 're excited , " she said " you look okay . " " Well , I 'm excited , " I told her . " I took a book out of the library for the first time in my life without checking it out . " " You mean you stole a book ? " " No . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take it back . " " What kind of a book is it ? " I could see that Blix thought that it might be a book I was ashamed to present to a librarian . Something silly or off-color . I held out the book . " A life of Charlotte Bronte . " Blix knew all about the Brontes even if she had n't read Mrs. Gaskell . She had a kind of Heathcliff in her own life and like Emily she had an older sister . " I do n't know why you could n't check it out . " I knew why . Because it would have been like getting a permit to pray , or a certificate for kissing . I was n't going to have a librarian stamping down with her little mechanical clicker on a message to me from a hundred years ago about the right way for sisters to love and care for each other . But I could n't tell Blix this any more than I had been able so far to deliver Mama 's message . Why not ? Emily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sharing their dreams , confessing their fears . And I could n't tell my sister so simple a thing as my reason for not checking a book out of a library . Blix could talk about it though . " You may think you 've just borrowed that book , but to the librarians you 're a thief . " " Thief " was the very word I needed . It made me lighthearted . I felt as if I had risked something  --  for Blix . It was a breakthrough . If I could steal a book I could surely manage a few words of good sense and sisterly counsel . I left the Normal Hill Apartments with Blix feeling that the worst was over . We went down the hill and turned left on Sixth . Christmas was past and its remains looked tawdry , a festive table left uncleared and its clutter debasing the memories of the feast . The stars were out but their story had been told . No one would think of wise men and shepherds again for another year . The wine-and-candles restaurantBlix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought . In a basement . The sign was n't very conspicuous . We might miss it . People turned their heads to look at Blix . They always did  --  for reasons other , I think , than that she was very pretty . She had a quality of yearning which required a response from passers-by to complete her . Passers-by did respond . Her movement along a street was the occasion for an emotional duet : yearning and response . She wanted , and they gave ; and both felt better for it . Something lived , momentarily . Blix was the life the city streets had lost with the passing of Christmas . In Pershing Square a great burly Negro , the color ( and size ) of a desert mountain at dusk , was singing revival hymns . Behind him stood a flour-white woman with her hand on his arm . Her eyes were closed , her lips moved . She appeared to be praying ; the arm that linked her to him trembled . Did she give him power ? Or was the flow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puppet , or she his ? Or neither ? Two together , one as alive as the other ? We had been walking along , aware of ourselves , of shop windows , of odd people like the Negro singer , thinking of what lay ahead of us.  |p135Then  we began to notice that there was something unusual about those who , with us , were walking down Sixth Street . A brisk stream of people in theater clothes moved together as if toward a known and common destination . Blix and I , brisk walkersourselves , were , and had been for some time , a part of this procession . For a minute it was like either falling into a dream or waking out of one . Blix said , " Tassie , what is it ? What 's happening ? " I did n't know , but I was accustomed , when asked , to finding answers for Blix . It was a part of my role as older sister . " They 're all going to the same place . " It was n't much of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laughing , animated ; no one was tired or bored or worried . The women were perfumed . We could smell them . Their high-heeled slippers , black satin and gold kid , struck the pavementwith the light clatter of rain . The women swung beaded bags and they wore pearls , or possibly even diamonds . Under their wraps of velvet and fur , there was a glitter of jewelry . The men were dressed in dark handsome suits . Their overcoats had velvet collars . " They 're going to a play , " I told Blix . " Or to hear a speech . Or to a concert . " When we were in front of the Biltmore , Blix said , " Let 's go with them , Tassie . " " Without asking them where they 're going ? " " Without asking . " " This might be pretty expensive . " " We could beg . " " What do you mean , ' beg ' ? " " Say , ' We 've lost our tickets . We ca n't get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it and I 'll back you up . " The minute we decided to join the procession , we became lighthearted . Abandoned , and possibly pregnant  --  if this was what Blix was  --  uncompanioned and ailing  --  and that was my problem  --  we did n't care . Young , daring . Blix was as well dressed as any , and far prettier than most . With my book ( I had n't been able top136leave Mrs. Gaskell behind ) , I might pass for a student . No one expects students to have the money to dress for the opera . If that was where we were heading . That we did n't know where we were heading was the joy of it . Toward something good , we hoped . We were still optimistic . We still believed in secrets . Did n't we have to ? If what we already knew about life were the whole of it , how could we ever hurry again ? Take chances ? Or laugh ? There had to be more . We were laughing . I was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had passed the Biltmore , I put my arm through Blix 's , in pure pleasure , and in order to keep from being separated . Blix 's arm remained a little rigid . I read it like Braille : I was no substitute for Vurl . This was something that had not occurred to me . She could have done this with Vurl . He was the one , perhaps , who taught her such nonchalance . " Let 's go where they go . " " Beg , if necessary . " My training was the opposite . Everett would have smelled , as we did , music or drama or lectures afar off , and bolted . And never have moved , destination unknown , toward any event whatever . The column , of which we were now a part , paused at the Biltmorecorner before crossing the street . We saw , at this point , our destination : the Shrine Auditorium . And by reading the marquee , we learned why we were going there : Madame Lucia Valzaniwas to sing . Now a female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not what we would have chosen . We knew nothing of music , and if the evening had to be musical , we would have chosen a male pianist with flying hands and tossing hair , or an orchestra , able to stun us with sound . Madame Lucia Valzani was what we had , however , and she was worth looking at . Our eyes were better trained than our ears ; we noted her lacquered black hair , her fine oval face , and her sumptuous bosom . She began to sing , but for fifteen minutes or so , Blix and I heard nothing . We took in the wonder of Madame Valzani 's appearance , of the auditorium , of the audience , of the fact thatp137we , the Murphy girls , brought up in the Linda Hills and more accustomed to cicadas than contraltos , were actually there . Finally , we became aware of the sounds Madame was making . We began to hear . Our overly conscious eyes ceded some territory to our ears . The sight of flashing sequins , the exciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valzani sang were not in English , so it was not the story we were hearing that moved us . By grace alone , by sound alone , a human voice entered and spoke to us in a language we understood but did not know . We thought it was entertainment ; it was not . We were too selfconsciousto call it art . But it had art 's concentration and firepower . It went in small , like a bullet , but once inside , it flowered like a dumdum . It went in the size of a song , then began to grow . It became a life ; not a baby 's simple life of sleeping and eating , but a man 's life . Schumann 's , Wagner 's , Schubert 's , large with an accumulation of joy and sorrow , even wisdom . It was sound . It entered our ears , but we felt it , too , in the same way that we could simultaneously hear and feel the wind , or the surf . And taste them , too : salt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that flooded the auditorium , there was no Mount Ararat of escapeleft for any listener . Then , without notice , the great voice would dwindle down as thin as a needle shaft . I remembered Le Cid and his gnat . Thus it penetrated individual hearts . Blix and I were wounded and bleeding , but we loved our wounds . We were alive and suffering . When the concert was over we were scarcely able to walk . But we could float . We were ennobled and enraptured . We found the restaurant Blix had in mind without looking for it . Blix 's charm got us a good corner table . Blix faced toward the room , I toward Blix . She had on green again , not the corduroy suit , but taffeta ; the green of the dress was reflected in her tawny eyes . The restaurant was the most beautiful I had ever seen ; " picturesque " and " romantic " were my words for it . It had brick floors , copper sconces , tables with red-checked tablecloths , candles in wine bottles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the table , the waiter lighted the candles , and Blix ordered : chicken en casserole and port wine . Port ? At the time , I had no idea of the variety of drinks , or that one variety was more suitable for some courses and dishes than others . We had a whole bottle of port . We drank a whole bottle . I more than Blix , probably . I was always a greater eater and drinker than she . I do n't know whether or not the wine loosened my tongue . It did calm my excitement . It acted as a sedative after the strong stimulantsof Emily , Heathcliff , and Madame Valzani . It leveled me off to where speech was possible . I drank it like water , though in my opinion it tasted much worse ; it was n't until I went to bed , and found that when I turned over , my body rose ceilingward and hung there , delicately poised for a moment or two before descending , that I knew I had n't been drinking water . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began bluntly and crudely , and even cruelly , though that was not my intention . " Blix , " I said , " I found your purses in your closet . " There was no reaction . For the moment , in the lingering excitement of the concert , in the pleasure of eating and drinking , I think Blix had actually forgotten Vurl . She did n't understand which purses I was talking about . She had many and she was always urging me to borrow one of hers and to leave my practical handbag , which she called my " shopping bag , " at home . She looked down now at my nondescript bag . " Why did n't you take one ? " she asked . " I mean the purses you tried to hide . " When I said that , something came into Blix 's eyes , something alive and shining , wounded , but trying to live . It was as if the whole of Blix , the whole of her life and her meaning to herself , at that moment concentrated in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and visibly dying and aware of who was doing the killing . I had read many times of the life-yearning of small animals cornered , awaiting death . That small , pitiful animalin all the concentration of its acceptance of fate lived in Blix 's eyes  --  for one second . Then died . The light went out . What was next visible was shame.  |p139Is  shame the worst look we can bring into a person 's eyes ? Is fear worse ? I have never been responsible for that , but I was responsible for shame , and that is very bad . Blix was ashamed of being " a girl in trouble " ; and she was ashamed to have me know it . For there is no use in false modesty ; in denying that up to this time , Blix valued my opinion . So she knew what I meant . It was in her eyes . And since shame , I supposed , was what Mother wanted her to feel , as protection against the recurrence of such acts , I kept myself from comfortingher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What the hell does it matter , anyway ? " Instead , I said , " I found the three purses you had hidden  --  and what you had in them . " Blix tried to be angry ; she tried to manage some emotion , any emotion , to cover up or dilute the shame . The best she could do was to say , " I thought purses were private property . " Before I could remind her of her many offers to lend them , she added , " What 's in them , I mean . " I can not recall the words of that conversation  --  for the very good reason , I suppose , that I have tried for so many years to forget that the conversation ever took place . On the matter of Blix 's health  --  the harm that she could do herself ; kill herself , actually , with such concoctions , and the taking of those baths and exercises  --  I was , I think , probably right . Though God knows that in giving any such advice a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think I was possibly on firmer ground , though I had no evidence , in calling Vurl a selfish two-timer and not worth her little finger . I was on agreed ground , anyway , in keeping her from knowing that Mother knew , and in suggesting that Mother counted on her . I tried to do what Mother expected of me , which , in its crudest terms , was to say to Blix , " If you love me , reform . " All the while letting her remember that I did this on the eve of a major operation . I knew how much Vurl had caused her to suffer . I did n't preach purity to her . I preached health . " Is Vurl worth killing yourselfp140for ? " I stuck to one of Mother 's points . " Have you thought that if Father and Mother found out about this , it would break their hearts ? " This was n't very honest ground ; Mother knew , and , while sad and worried , her heart obviously was n't broken , and obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart in pre-pill days was the best deterrent yet developed . I got away from Mother 's broken heart and dwelt on the points in which I really believed . Health , Happiness , and Plain Good Sense . It would be just Plain Good Sense , I told her , to avoid the act that had resulted in her present plight . It would be just Plain Bad Sense to ever let that happen again . The best thing would be never to see Vurl again . But with the two of them in the same college , and with Vurl as prepossessing as he was , an occasional date might be more than she could resist . But the act . She could resist that . That could be abandoned forthwith . It would require nothing more than a little firmness with Vurl . The act could be abandonedwith nothing but rejoicing ; morality , health , convenience  --  all coinciding . A wife had duties . But she had no duties . She could choose her own pleasure , not Vurl 's . And , in doing so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past month 's doubt and misery . The shame , as I talked , went out of Blix 's eyes ; talk was easier . Her look now was curious , speculating . She seemed to invite me to continue . Perhaps she did n't . Perhaps the wine was more effectivethan I knew . In any case , I continued . This subject , the obvious Plain Good Sense of " never again until she was married and the act became her duty , " was not a real Bronte subject . Anne , Emily , and Charlotte had not , I supposed , talked of it as they paced their firelit floor . But candles were burning for Blix and me . The subject was love and death , life and shame , a mother 's trust and a daughter 's dishonor . I loved Blix . Without falseness , without harping on what I did n't believe  --  " Mother 's broken heart " or " my dying wish "  --  I was able ( I thought ) to bring reason and good sense to her attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left , pity took over . " Poor Tassie ! " she said.  | " Poor Tassie ' ? " I asked . For a minute I thought she was talking about my operation . But she was n't . I had given her leave to forget it and she had . " Poor Tassie , " she repeated . " You do n't know what you 're talking about , do you ? You do n't know a single solitary thing more than you did at twelve . Do you ? " On the day of Mother 's funeral , the day Blix admitted that she had always resented me , I decided to tell her the truth about those three purses . I had kept Mama 's secret for twenty years . I had not robbed Blix of " someone who believed in her . " But death had taken that believer away , and Blix and I were alive . And perhaps she would resent me less if she knew that the talk I had had with her that night in Los Angeles was made to please Mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her discovery , not mine . I thought over the pros and cons of my confession . I tried to imagine both Blix 's and Mother 's response to my telling . Mother had always cherished the idea of family unity : brothers and sisters together , loving each other . If the truth about the pocketbooks would draw Blix closer to me , Mother would be for it . " It do n't matter what Blix thinks about me any longer , " she 'd tell me . " Why , petty , if telling Blix that I put you up to that talk will help you two girls , tell her ! Tell her the night before the operation was my idea , too . Tell her I was n't above doing anything to help her . Why shoot , I 've gone to my reward . It 's all settled , one way or another . And it wo n't mean much to me if my two girls are on the outs here below . " And Blix ? Would n't she understand ? Perhaps even pity ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Mother 's little helper . I might have known . " After Blix went downstairs , I dried my eyes , combed my hair , put on lipstick . I did n't want the messenger to offend , before thep142message was heard . Blix was alone in the kitchen . Mother had been away from it for three days , but it was still her room entirely . Her bird sang in its cage in the bay window . The teakettle , one of those patented hissers , hissed on the stove . Blix was at the round fumed-oak table ( Mother had enameled it butter yellow ) in the bay window . She had a cup of coffee and was looking at the morning paper . Before I could begin my speech , she began to read . " Librarian Tasmania Murphy , in private life the wife of Pete Orcino , is in Los Angeles celebrating her successful attack on censorship in the state library . If you want to consult the dirtyworddictionary , ' read Catcher in the Rye , or peruse the latest papers from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks to Tasmania 's bastions of liberty ' speech , in which she attacked as ' dictatorial ' the right-wing effort to ' spoon-feed ' the minds of inquiring Americans . Meanwhile , back at the ranch , ' Pete is playing in the Thunderbird Invitational Tournament . If Pete has Tassie 's luck , the Orcinos will clean up big this month . " Blix put the paper down . " Everything worked out just fine for your trip down , did n't it ? " Blix could do things like this . She knew perfectly well that I had n't been in Los Angeles at all , and that any celebrating I had done about censorship was over and done with two weeks ago . She knew perfectly well that Pete 's entry in the tournament was a matter of long standing , and that , in any case , there was no point in his hanging around , a second husband in a houseful of inlawsat a time of sorrow . What Blix said , this insinuation that I had come south as much to receive plaudits as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had confessed to me upstairs : the confession I had refused to accept . I did n't understand that then . But I had learned to accept , as part of Blix 's make-up , such sudden and inexplicable attacks . Sometimes they made me mad . Sometimes they made me cry . That morning , because I was intent on clearing up that misunder/standing of twenty years ago , I did n't attempt to explain or contradicther implications ( which she knew were untrue ) about my censorship speech . " Blix , " I said , " there 's something I want to tell you . Something you do n't know . " " There 's a lot I do n't know . You 've chosen a fine pupil . " I ignored that , too . But Blix , who always knew what she wasdoing , knew what she had done and tried to make up for it . " How about a cup of coffee ? " " No , thanks . Blix , do you remember that trip we made to the Normal Hill Apartments ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you remember our dinner afterward ? " " It would be hard to forget . " " I want to tell you something about that . I do n't know whether I should or not . But what you had to say about resenting me decided me . It came to me that what I said that night might have something to do with your feelings . You know I 've never envied or resented you . I 've always been proud of you . I always supposed it was the same with you . " " I 've told you before , " Blix said , " that what you feel , you'reconvinced everyone else will feel . You 're proud , so I 'm proud . " I ignored this . " Mama would hate your resenting me , " I said . " Mama hated quite a few things about me . Anyway , she 's inher grave now . You and Mama are n't in cahoots any longer . Youdo n't have to worry any more about what she thinks . " " I admit that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your life . For purposes of keeping me in line . " " I did n't know that you were out of line . Except once when Mama . . . " Let 's leave Mama out of it . " " I ca n't  --  and tell you the truth . " " I 'm not your board of directors . You do n't have to tell me the truth . " " Maybe not . But , Blix , I want you to understand . "  | " What is there to understand ? " " I 'm trying to tell you . Promise not to walk out on me before I 've finished . " " I have n't made any promise to hear you out . I can walk out any time I want to . " With that threat , I plunged right into my confession . " That dinner was Mama 's idea . And in spite of what you were going through , you did your best to make it what you thought it actuallywas : a celebration for me , before I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd had . You made jokes . You analyzed people and their outfits . I loved you for it . But it made what I had to say harder to say . Finally I told you . A look came into your eyes I 've never forgotten . Then it disappeared . I think maybe it was any love you had for me . Maybe it was then your resentment started . " Blix made a shadowy shake of her head . I went on . " At least it did n't do anything to make it less . I thought I 'd tell you the truth now , about that night . Mother showed me those purses . I had never suspected anything . She told me to talk to you , the night before I went under the knife . ' To tell you that my last thoughts were about you . " " Were they ? " " Yes , they were . Mama may have put them in my head to begin with , but they were mine that night and they were about you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bird pecked away at the seeds on the floor of his cage . The refrigerator came on . The teakettle hissed . There was a slight smell of gas in the kitchen . Blix had her cigarette in her mouth . She inhaled slowly . I waited a long time for her to exhale . She said , very quietly , " So Mother knew , all along . " " I do n't know how long she 'd known . But she knew about the purses . " " She knew something else . She knew your talk would stop me from ever seeing Vurl again . " " I did n't know that you never saw him again . "  | " Never again . Oh , I saw him at a distance a few times . But I was never with him again . In any way . Mother stage-set that little talk of yours just right . She should have been a senator . Or a general . Oh , she outthought us both . I wanted to be like you , Tassie . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Strong , sweet , and clean ; she knew that . She knew that would work on me as much as your going under the knife . ' You did n't know that . But she did . And she could n't tell you that , of course . So there you were . . . strong and sweet and clean . . . brave and gay . . . the . . . night before the knife . . . and your last thoughts were of me . " " Are n't you glad you broke up with Vurl ? No matter how it was brought about ? " " Glad ? I do n't know . " " You know how he turned out . " " I loved him . " " Why did you pay any attention to what I said , then ? " " What chance did I have ? You convinced that board that censorshipwas un-American , did n't you ? I called Vurl the next evening after I took you to the hospital . I used to him all the words you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I suppose . Oh , I loved Vurl and he loved me , but that speech of mine did it . Of course he did n't know that I had heard it from someone who had only one chance in ten to live . " " One chance in ten ? They did n't know it was that serious until they opened me up . " " Mother knew . . . " Blix began . Then she said slowly , " Anywaythat 's what she told me . Before the operation . One chance in ten . " We neither one said anything for a while . Blix emptied her cold coffee , poured herself another cup , lit another cigarette . Then she said , " Mama probably suffered hell the next day . She must have felt that her telling me you had one chance in ten made it happen . She had superstitions that way . She thought there was a power in words . If you 'd died , she would 've blamed herself . "  | " Did she blame herself about you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She never blamed herselfabout Milt that I know of . " That was the first and last time I ever heard Blix say anything against Milt . If it was against . Blix finished her coffee , stubbed out her cigarette . " My God , my God , " she said . " So I threw over Vurl at the request of a dying sister . " " I did n't tell you I was dying . I did n't know that I was dying . " For a moment I thought I might see the young Blix again , the egg-thrower , the skirt-ripper . But that Blix had really died . " You acted it , " she said quietly . " You told me that if Mama ever found out , it would break her heart . And she already knew , and it had n't broken her heart . And you knew it . Is n't that treachery ? Is n't it ? " " I did it because I loved you . " " Loved me ! You did it because you loved Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What you loved was praise . " " From my own mother ? Who does n't ? " " You loved pleasing anyone . You still do . That 's what makes you so good with the speeches . " Was it true ? I could n't answer . " Now you 've told me a terrible thing about Mother in order to win me over . " " I admit I want to win you over . But that 's not so terrible either . And what 's so awful about a mother 's trying to save her daughter from a man who gets her pregnant , then risks her life with drugstore remedies ? " " Why did n't she ask me if I wanted to be saved ? And look how she tried to do it . By lies . By using you . Can you forgive her that ? " " There 's nothing to forgive . I understand why she asked me . And I told you because I hoped you would forgive me . " " Forgive you ! Why , Tassie , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for . Ever since you were a kid , you 've been a poor blind monkey 's paw. "  |p147I  said , " Well , surely you ca n't resent a poor blind monkey 's paw ? Can you , Blix ? " Blix said , " Oh God , Tassie , do n't try to clown your way out of it . Do n't try to be funny . Do n't try to make black white . Just face it . " I faced it . I had failed with Blix . What I 'd said had n't worked . And I did n't have anything more to say . Or the strength to say it . Or to move . I sat there at the table , and the sights and sounds of the kitchen swept across me like a warm , but possibly drowning tide . I did n't want to be a person . Not the person I was , anyway . I 'd rather be the sunlight on the yellow table , or the light wind rustling the leaves in the clump of eucalyptus down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at the cat on the washing machine on the back porch , and his yellow eyes opened wide to let me in . This was Mama 's world . She had died , and I had betrayedher now , as I had Blix before . Always an approbation seeker ! The kitchen 's warmth and brightness narrowed and focused . The sounds fused . The cat wanted in . The doves called " home . " The kettle 's sound joined that of the palms . Blix was again hidden behind the smoke of cigarettes , one in her hand , one smoldering on her saucer . I heard Mother , in her springtime voice , which she never lost , say , " Petty , you took the blame for that for a long time . For as long as it would do any good . It 's my turn now . I 'll take the blame . You do what you can for your little sister . You be a mother to her . " Blix waved the smoke away with her hand . I saw her sandstoneeyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fan ; I was a person facing a person now , not palm , or wind , or sunlight . " You 're free for the first time , Tassie , " Blix said . " If you want to be . You could please yourself for a change  --  if you ever knew how  --  if you have n't lost the habit . " I was a person alive , facing another living person . I knew that . But the echo of Mother 's voice was still in my ears . " But maybe you do n't ... and maybe you have , " Blix added.  |p148When  Blix visited us last July we were still playing the game of hope . We were n't playing that game any more when I went to be with her in September . Blix was in bed , though not " bedfast . " By electing earlier than need be some of the disabilities of her sickness , she seemed to make them a matter of choice rather than of necessity . Fate was not pushing her around . There was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blix was sick . Her skin was clear and bright . Her bones were too fine and too good to be harmed by any loss of weight . She was as careful with make-up as ever . She still wore her hair , though putting it up tired her , in her usual elegant French twist . She had bleached it for some years , and the desert sunlight , through the glass wall of her bedroom , gave it a hoarfrost sheen . She did n't , in the daytime , wear nightclothes in bed , but soft Capris with a variety of tops , more suggestive of beaches and ski resorts than sickrooms . " I thought I might never see you again , " she said very softly and somewhat wonderingly , the day I arrived.  |p149I  did n't know , and still do n't , whether she meant that she thought that I would n't come or that she would n't be alive when I did come . As in the past summer , when we had exerted a faith in the unseen to believe her well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe her ill . Mother and I had always looked far more draggle-tailed in the midst of our colds and sore throats and headaches than Blix did mortally stricken . Blix had cared very little for Mama 's and my sickbed performances . But she had enjoyed a life of nearly perfect health , while Mother and I had moaned and groaned our way through a series of illnesses . We had told her that if she ever was sick , she would talk out of the other side of her mouth . " I will never moan and groan , " she had declared , " no matter how sick I am . " Mother and I would stifle our own moaning to predict , " Wait until you know what you 're talking about . " Now she had waited , now she knew what she was talking about ; but I never heard Blix groan : not awake or asleep ; not filled with drugs or waiting for a shot . On that first day with Blix , I arrived about noon . The timing of Blix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lunch . Tired from driving , flying  --  and waiting  --  since morning , I , too , had a nap . The desert air , so much warmer than what I had left , made me feel that I was retreating in time , traveling backward . I had left autumn and moved into full summer . Blix 's and my relationship seemed to have moved backward to an earlier stage , too . Big and little sisters , again , helper and helped , again , useful and ornamental , needing and needed , lovingand loved . I did not , on that first afternoon , grasp the meaning of our ease and happiness together . Happiness did not seem suitable under the circumstances . I thought I ought not to feel it . But happiness was what I felt . When I awakened , Blix was still sleeping . I hurried to shower and dress before she woke up . The pleasures of desert living are heightened by perversities : to be living , not with nature , but in spite of it ; to stand in ap150shower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterless land . Blix was awake when I came in . She smiled , but said nothing . " How are you , Blix ? " " Oh , I have a pain , " Blix said . " But it 's just an old shoe pain , one I can live with . " " Blix , would you like a glass of beer ? " I knew that she 'd lost her taste for beer , but a glass now , with the shadows getting longer and day ending , would seem like old times . She was willing , for old time 's sake , to play-act . " Yes , " she said . " This afternoon , I think I would like some . " While we were drinking , Dr. Reyes , without our hearing him , came to the bedroom door . It was his custom  --  I did n't know it then  --  to give one rap on the outside door and then enter , unbidden . " What is this ? " he asked , as he saw us . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice , " Blix told him . " I choose beer , " he said , " naturally . " " Actually , it is n't an either-or situation , " Blix said . " Here , you can have both . " Dr. Reyes was in his mid-thirties , a tall , melancholy-looking young man . He could flash a white smile now and then , but betweensmiles he looked troubled . Blix said he had a right to . He had seen troubles . Dr. Reyes 's mother had been a high-school teacher in New Araby , a town fifty miles from Oasis , where Blix lived . Dates are the crop in New Araby , and John Reyes 's father had been the foreman at one of the big date ranches there . Ruth Ellis , the high-school English teacher , had fallen in love with the goodlookingMexican foreman and married him . She was thereupon fired from her job . There are plenty of mixed marriages in the valley , though not usually between high-school teachers and Mexican foremen . The children of such marriages are Mexicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segregated schools , swimmingp151pools , theater seats . Ruth Ellis was n't having any of this for her son . As a result , little Johnny Reyes , who was n't accepted by the whites , and whose mother did n't permit him to play with the Mexicans , had a lonely life . And his looks did n't help him : a craggy Celtic face with a darker than usual Mexican coloring . The other way around would have been much easier for him : smooth Spanish-Indian face with white skin and blue eyes . That was n't the way it had turned out , and little Johnny Reyes carried on with what he had . Dr. Reyes was the man who first suspected Blix 's malignancy . He had n't performed the operation , but he had attended her in the hospital and since . The two of them had somehow surmountedthe stereotypes of what is known as the " doctor-patient relationship . " They liked each other as persons . Dr. Reyes , who had never developed a bedside manner , could be sarcastic and matter-of-fact  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a woman . Blix introduced us that first day . " Dr. Reyes , you have n't met my sister , Tasmania Orcino . " " My God , " Dr. Reyes said , " what a name ! " " The name , " I told him , " is not my fault . But the bare feet  --  and this ancient muumuu are . And I apologize . " " Do n't apologize . I 'm pleased to find a lady librarian out of her flat-heeled shoes . " " How long has it been since you were in a library , Dr. Reyes ? " " About ten years . I can buy my books now , thank God . " " While you were changing , the librarians were , too . " " Touche , Mrs. Orcino . " Blix laughed , easy with her old shoe pain , the nostalgic beer , the doctor she liked . " What kind of beer do you want ? " I asked . " The brand does n't matter so long as you hold me down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left I walked to the car with him . I had promised Blix to talk to him . " Sound him out , " she had told me . " See where he stands . Findp152out how much we can count on him . We can plan our heads off , and he can wreck every plan if he wants to . " " Would n't it be better for you to talk to him ? " " I could n't . " So that left it to me . The carport was outside the kitchen door . Before opening the door , I paused . " I can never get used to the difference between the outside and inside temperatures , " I told him . " I keep thinkingthat I ought to be able to see something that would warn me about the difference . " " Like the blind child who asked , What color is the wind ? ' " Dr. Reyes suggested . I was surprised . " I suppose so . I suppose I think heat should have a red glare , like a furnace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt like a furnace , anyway , and the first shock was always delightful to me  --  like a plunge into cold waters  --  and with the same knowledge that what one was experiencing was terminable . What one enjoyed was neither heat nor cold , but the exciting awareness of the body 's ability to experience . I did n't know where to begin my conversation with Dr. Reyes . One thing I did know , and that was that he would n't be taken in by any fabrication of mine about being a story writer . I could n't say to him , " Doctor , I am thinking about writing a story about a woman who is contemplating suicide . What would the attitude of this woman 's doctor be ? " But I had to begin somewhere . " Dr. Reyes , " I said , " if Blix should feel an unusual amount of pain , would it be all right for me to give her her pills a little oftener than you have prescribed ? " Dr. Reves 's eyes , I noticed , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of an irrigation ditch . He answered my question in a quick , harsh voice . " No . The time 's specified in the prescription . Follow it . " " I was thinking about an emergency . . . some sudden seizure . I thought perhaps . , "  | " You do n't need to think about that . Call me in any emergency . I 'll decide on the amount of medication your sister needs . " Perhaps Dr. Reyes thought he had been too harsh . In any case , he went on more quietly . " If I 'm too generous with the painkillers now , if I try to save her every pang now , I 'm simply preparing a certain hell for her later on  --  when she 's really going to need help . " " Dr. Reyes , " I said , " Blix does n't intend to go through that later hell . " Dr. Reyes gave no sign whatsoever that he had heard what I had said . " I 'll stop in in a day or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , phone . Office , hospital , or home . You 'll be able to catch me one of those places . Or in between . " The minute I came back to her room after my first talk with Dr. Reyes , Blix said , " Did you ask him ? " There was n't the least need , actually , for Dr. Reyes 's opinion on that subject . I had come to the desert with all the informationan experienced doctor could give me and there was no reason to doubt any of it . We did need , and had to have , some assurance that Dr. Reyes would n't try to send Blix back to a hospital , or saddle us with a twenty-four-hour-a-day nurse , or simply camp on our doorstep , prepared to undertake day or night rescue missions . But as to dosage , we did n't really need another opinion . To Blix 's mind , however , there was no authority like Dr. Reyes . She had followed all of his advice so far . She would like to have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this final medication . So I had to disappoint Blix : tell her no , I had n't asked him . " He has to know me better , " I told her , " before he 's going to trust me with any talk like that . He does n't know but what my hobby may be the ruination of doctors . He does n't know but what I may be a gossipy blabbermouth . He does n't know whether I love you or hate you . " Blix objected . " He could n't think that ! "  | " I did n't say he did . But relatives do hate each other . That 's one of the reasons the laws are what they are . They 're to protect you . " Blix gave me one of her big wide-open looks . " Let the law look after itself , " she said , " and I 'll look after myself . " The second time I talked with Dr. Reyes , he was more outspoken . " How many cases of terminal sickness of this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You 're lucky . I 've known hundreds and I 've heard at least half of them say exactly what Blix is saying now . ' I ' 11 never go through with it . ' That 's what they say at this stage . And they believe it . ' When it gets too bad , I 'll put an end to it . ' It never gets too bad . The smaller the amount of life they have to hang onto , the tighter they cling . Or perhaps the patient does n't change his mind . He still does n't want to go through with the pain . But he has postponed doing anything for so long he 's lost the ability to act . They ca n't foresee that . I do n't expect them to . But I have to . I 'm the doctor for the whole course of their disease . Sure , I can make them fairly comfortable in the beginning . I can keep Blix comfortable now . And condemn her to hell later on . The pain getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective . I 've got to foresee that . Is that what you want for Blix ? " I tried to defend myself . " Of course I do n't want that for Blix . But she 's one patient who 'll do what she plans to do . " " Blix sick and Blix well are two different persons . She is , comparativelyspeaking , well now . I know what sickness does to a person . " " Not Blix . " Dr. Reyes refused to go around that circle again . I knew Blix . He knew sickness . We could grow hoarse repeating those statements . I came right out in the open with Blix 's worry.  | " Blix is afraid that an overdose might make her sick . " Dr. Reyes did n't help me . I was n't going to be permitted to do any beating about the bush with him . " An overdose of what ? " " Sleeping pills . " " I did n't know she had any . I have n't prescribed any . " " I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grains ? " " One and a half . " " Three should be plenty . " This was a ridiculous answer . But before I could express any astonishment , Dr. Reyes went out into the heat , got into his car , and sliced away into the afternoon shimmer with surgical sureness . When I told Blix what Dr. Reyes had said , she laughed . She was proud of him . He was going to be a hard nut to crack . " He 's no citizens ' council , " she said . " You ca n't talk to him about censorship and bring tears to his eyes . " " Maybe I asked a foolish question . At any rate , I got a foolish answer . " " You already know the answer , do n't you ? " " I do . That 's what I 've been telling you . It was your idea to ask Reyes . " " Okay . You tried . Now he knows . What we 've got to work on now is to keep him from being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw Dr. Reyes was the night he taught , or tried to teach , me to give Blix a shot . That night , neither Blix nor I had any interest in trying to persuade him to give up his **29;7102;TOOLONG . For a week or so after that , I slept in the bed next to Blix 's . It was during this week that she discovered that she could n't takep156Numorphan and Seconal at the same time  --  the combination gave her frightening dreams ; though once in a while the dream was simply outlandish . Even funny . One night when I awakened her for a shot , she opened her eyes , smiling . " I was dreaming about our Republican ancestors . " " That ca n't have been very gay . " " It was interesting . They were having a heartichoke . " I stopped assembling the hypodermic needle . " A what ? " " A heartichoke . You know , a Zanzibar . " " A Zanzibar ? " " You know what I mean . They have them all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides . A bill comes up that the other side does n't want passed so they start Zanzibarring . " I knew then what she meant . If she was teasing me , I would tease her a little in return . " If it 's political , " I said , " phone Milt . He 'll know the word . " Milt had a phone in his office , which adjoined his bedroom . It had a different number from Blix 's , and sometimes Blix phoned him for a chat . But not at three o'clock in the morning . The last thing Milt did before going to bed was to announce the exact time at which he would arise the next morning . Blix got my joke . " The word has come to me , " she said demurely . " It 's a filibuster . " Blix was n't the only one experimenting with drugs that week . I had to take enough Seconal to let me go back to sleep between shots , but not enough to prevent me from waking up in three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep me sleeping when my unconscious told me Blix 's medication time had come . Bugles could n't have awakened me more suddenly or completely . Drifting back to sleep again was a more difficult matter ; no matter how many pills I took ( and I had a limit beyond which I would n't go ) , the process was slow and chancy . For a half an hour or so after Blix 's shot and my pill , we lay , neither awake nor asleep , inhabitants of some world hard top157name : neither here nor there , neither now nor then . Because the place , if it was a place , and the time , if it was a time , were strange , we were free in it . We acted like tourists , capable of conduct abroad that would appall us at home ; able , in the foreignnessof our drugged half hour , to relive happenings never before mentioned . It was an odd thing . More pitiful , actually , than odd . Here we were , sisters . We had had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us loving each other . All of us having suffered , having been confronted by perplexities , disasters , heartbreak . But not one had confided in the other , had gone to the other saying , " Comfort me , advise me , " or even " Listen to me . " Certainly not " Pray for me , " as Pilgrim women of an earlier generation would have done . Why not ? Oh , why not ? Why never the arms outstretched ? The shoulder offered for the other 's tears ? Or vice versa . Why did we suffer alone ? Self-condemned to be childless , motherless , sisterless . Why ? Part of the Pilgrim discipline had lapsed , the comforting part : the praying and sharing . Part of it had persisted : the prudish part . Much of a woman 's unhappiness has to do with sex . And since sex was the one subject which this mother had taught these daughters was unmentionable , we lived ( with each other ) our secret , unmentionable , frequently suffering lives . But for drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providesno obstacle at all . We were de-Pilgrimed by them ; in the minutes before the pain let up , or the sleep set in , that job was done completely . One night Blix concluded a confession , dreamily , even complacently . " I would have made a first-class whore , " she said . There has probably been more speculation on this subject by women than on all other subjects combined . Women might , perhaps , be divided into two classes : those who think they have an aptitude for this profession , and those who think they would fail at it . And of those who think they would succeed , there might be a further subdivision : those who take pride in the fact , and those who are ashamed of it.  |p158Blix  's statement combined pride and shame . I do n't think she considered this aptitude on a par with a gift for composing poetry or even raising a houseful of children . On the other hand , I do n't know that she would have traded it for either . Admirable or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not one to harbor remorse or nurse vain hopes , she accepted it . The Pilgrim in Blix had to be substantially anesthetized to permit her to make any such admission . Even so , it was a roundaboutway of saying something else , something even less admirableto a Pilgrim : " I found sex enjoyable . " Brought up as she was , this had to be equated with whorishness . Another Pilgrim misconception , no doubt . She knew , and I knew , that this was what she was saying , and that she would have been the first to revolt against the hard-working whorehouse routine of any conscientiousmadam . Before Blix had made her disguised confession ( or claim ) we had been talking about Vurl , murmuring about him , actually , in desert darkness , in drugged honesty , aware of approaching silence . The mind must move . When there is nothing to go forward to , it explores the past . The past is really almost as much a work of the imagination as the future . What really happened ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said ? Why was that choice , and not another , made ? Was there , in reality , any other choice ? " So it was Vurl , " I said . This being my roundabout comment on Blix 's roundabout statement about sex . " Vurl , " Blix exclaimed , " Vurl ! " There was far more surprise in her voice than there had been in mine when I heard her report of Zanzibarring . " Vurl ! " He might have been the Republican ancestor she had dreamed about . " I was madly in love with him . But making love ! Oh , no . Whatever made you think that ? " What could I say ? " He was so good-looking " ? Or " You did succumb ! " Or " You admit you were madly in love with him " ? I said nothing . " Vurl ! He could n't hold a candle to Milt . "  |p159Milt  ? Milt ! Well , her Numorphan was stronger than my Seconal . Besides , Blix had n't been brought up as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act , to her brothers and sisters . She could speak out , where I could n't . Still , I felt ungenerous , careful , self-preserving . Blix was willing to give herself away . She was willing to make me the gift of the life she had had . She was willing to open her heart to me . What could I do for her ? What account reflecting no credit on me ? What occurrence she would n't have guessed , about which she could ponder as the drugs took effect ? " Blix , " I said , " do you remember that operation I had when I was twenty-four ? At Christmas time ? " " I remember our talk the night before . " " I want to forget that . You knew the nurse I had . That gorgonhairedgirl . We did n't think she was a girl then  --  she must 've been thirty . Anyway , when I came to , I found that I had been split from navel to crotch . Up as far as possible and down as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incision did n't heal properly , and that nurse  --  she married Dr. Nielsen later  --  dressed the wound each day . She had fingers like spider legs , long , thin , and brown . I thought she must have more than four on each hand . I thought they were hairy . They crawled around everywhere , very delicately . Still , she hurt me . I thought she intended to hurt . Maybe she did n't . Maybe it could n't be helped . I do n't know . Anyway , I moaned and groaned . Shed tears , even . You would n't have liked me . " Then somehow I got the idea that she enjoyed the commotion I made . That the dressing was n't a success for her unless she got some response from me . So I learned to keep quiet . I clamped my mouth shut , looked out of the window , pretended that what was happening to me was happening to someone else . The minute she leaned over me , brushing my face with her steel-wool curls , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree . Why do they call them monkey puzzle trees ? Do they puzzle monkeys ? They puzzled me , and I was glad for it . My mind stayed outside trying to figure out their twistings and loopingsp160while she roamed around my incision with her poisonous little fingers . " I was out in the garden with my mind the morning she brought me back moaning . I did n't scream , because what I felt was n't pain . In some ways it was worse than pain . In some ways it was an unendurable pleasure . Though that 's pain , I guess . I actually thought I might be dying . If I could have moved , I would have risen up and hit that snakey-haired nurse . Not slapped her . Hit her with something hard , the water pitcher or the bedpan . I despised her . When she hurt me , I had hated her . But now I despised her . " ' Is there something wrong ? ' she asked . " She knew there was something wrong . She was responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . " A whisper was all I could manage . ' My wound , ' I told her . ' You touched my wound . ' " ' That was n't your wound I touched , you stupid girl . ' She brought her face down near mine . I could hear her . I could breathe again . The sensation was beginning to drain away . Her hair which smelled like copper , was in my face . I thought she was trying to stamp me out with her eyeballs . " ' Get away , ' I told her . " She stayed right where she was . ' That was n't your wound , ' she repeated . ' It had nothing to do with your wound . Do you understand ? ' " I did n't . ' Do n't do that again , ' I warned her . I shut my eyes so that I could n't see her scornful face . And all that hissing hair . She threw the sheet back across me and walked out . Another nurse took care of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . " I said , " Well , that 's something you do n't need to feel resentful about . " " I told you all my resentment had disappeared , " Blix said . " Something at that time you would n't have resented . " " At that time , I did n't know . I could n't have guessed . Whocould ? "  |p161We  both lay back against our pillows . " It would have been better , " I said , " if you had been giving me little talks in those days , instead of me giving you little talks . " " You never asked for any . You never asked for anything . " It was the truth . I wanted to be a big giver . Independent as a hog on ice . " I was proud of what I could do without . " " You did n't even know what you were doing without . " " I was proud of that , too . I was proud of my ignorance . " Blix said , " I believe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't think so then and institute therapy . " Blix did n't answer . I looked across at her in the starlit room . She had fallen asleep . I did n't sleep for a long time . After a while I heard coyotes calling from across the valley . Or that 's what it sounded like to me . Only the old timers can tell how many and from where . Why is that call so beautiful ? Loneliness , loneliness . Is that what it says ? There 's nothing beautiful about loneliness . Defiance ? Self-sufficiency ? Nostalgia ? When the coyotes called , Blix and I remembered Linda . Do they take us back further than childhood ? To the prairies ? To the cave before the dog had come in to share the warmth ? Their crying always seemed a good omen to me . Better than a rainbow , which is simply an arrangement of colors . Coyotes are an arrangement of flesh and blood like ourselves . Oh coyotes ! I suppose Noah , with his arkload of animals , had a pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him than any animal cry , however beautiful . I wanted to wake up Blix , who loved coyotes , to listen with me . I might awaken her pain , too . I let her sleep.  |p162If  I say that Blix and I were never the same again after that long ago Christmas of my twenty-fourth year , I am surely exaggerating . I am not lying , though . It seems to me that we did change . I was changed by what happened to me in the Baranca Clinic . Blix had been changed by the need to buy those medications , by the need to hide them in those three purses , and , finally , by my outrageous sermon . If we did n't change , then life itself began to change . Perhaps we did n't lose confidence in ourselves ; but we did lose confidence in life . It occurred to us for the first time that we might not be fate 's darlings after all . It occurred to us for the first time that life was not impressed by the way the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the books we read , or by the kind words we spoke to our young brothers and to our old parents . It occurred to us that we had better develop a little strategy . If life , after all , was not a fairy godmother , but an old witch , we had better be able , if required , to shove her into the oven . The strategies we developed were different . Blix had let herp163heart rule her head in loving Vurl . Okay . She would n't do that again . " The first question I 'm going to ask a boy is , What 's your bank balance ? ' I 've been careless . I 'm going to be careful from now on out . " My strategy was the opposite . I had been careful . Everett would have been approved by the board of deacons of any church . Same school , same religion , all that kind of thing . My head had approved of Everett . He was a careful girl 's choice . I did n't actually begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did n't , by an act of will , embark upon a program of drifting and dreaming . But it appears to me now that some mainspring in my nature had been loosened during the time I spent in the Baranca Clinic . In March of that year after my operation Everett began planning to dry apricots the following summer on a much larger scale than usual . He planned to buy apricots from other ranchers and to dry them , as well as his own , at our place . If he bought at low or even reasonable prices , processed the fruit economically and well , had the luck of a good market , and sold at an opportune time , he could make a lot of money . I did n't think that any of this would happen . I thought it likely that Everett would pay too much for the fruit , pick it late , dry it haphazardly , and sell it impulsively . I thought we would go broke , lose the ranch , and possibly end up in jail . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The need to advise , organize , supervise , had , however , left me . I had gone out of the business of foreseeing , forearming , forestalling . If , as a result of failure , Everett had to give up his dream of ranching and find himself a job as shoe clerk or Bible salesman that would be Everett 's hard luck . Or maybe good luck . Who could say ? At least it would be Everett 's luck . I was n't deserting Everett ; but I was no longer directing , either . Some/how , my stay in the Baranca Clinic had excused me from that job . Along in March or April , whenever it was that Everett first began to plan to run a big dry-shed , I also began to plan . This sounds contradictory for one who had given up foreseeing , forearming , et cetera . It was n't . My plan was nothing but summer itself ; for the first time in my life I intended to let summer happen to me . I intended to be with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mattered more than anything else . Better be sick and suffer sickness than healthy and unconscious . My plan for the summer was to be able to say in July , " I 'm in the midst of July . " And when September came , to say , " Summer has passed . This is the fall of the year . " Unconsciously , though , I began to keep an eye out for summer while spring rains were still falling . That was wrong . While imagining summer , I missed spring . I do n't remember a thing about that spring . Apricots bloomed , of course . The snow fields on Mount San Jacinto began to melt . The hills , I suppose , were blue with lupine and crimson with Indian paintbrush : I really do n't know . I missed it all . If summer was what I wanted , Brenner was certainly the place for it . It had summer the way the South Pole has snow . While I was dreaming about it , summer arrived . One afternoon toward the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside , was summer , heavy , warm , and fragrant . The umbrella trees had opened ; there were cool umbrella-shaped shadows at their feet . Pepper tree leaves , so lacy they moved every time a hummingbird flew by , hung heavy and inert . No birds were flying . They all sat deep in the palm tree caverns , dozing the heat away . The valley smelled like a country kitchen , wood range fired up and jam kettle bubbling . Cherries , apricots , peaches , plums : all had come to a rolling boil . The ripening vegetables had a bland , starchy smell , a man smell , as contrasted with the female smell of the acid-sweet fruits . I stood in the opened door and tried to identify individual scents . I failed . House smells were the only ones I recognized . Damp floor boards . Dust from recently sweptp165ingrain carpets . The vanilla scent from a floating island pudding , cooling in the kitchen . I went back to my ironing . Dreaming was over . Summer had arrived . At dusk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a summer afternoon had piled up behind Mount Tahquitz . They darkened as I watched . Then their scalloped edges were flushed with light , and I heard the distant rumble of thunder . The mountain storm of a summer afternoon had begun . There was not another thing to wait for . Summer was billowing up around me as rich and extravagant as I had dreamed : a sumptuous castle . I had planned to inhabit the whole of that castle : mount every stairway , gaze from every window , wave welcomes from every balcony . And here it was , complete . Turret on turret . Pennants flying . Drawbridgesdown . And I the sole possessor . And I could n't walk in . It was too lonely in there , too inhuman . Heat records would be broken that summer . To whom , inside the castle , could I say , " Think of it ! The hottest day since 1898 ! " Sunsets would vary . With whom could I discuss them ? As , " Is this sooty enough for an African sunset ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content myself by writing letters to Mama saying " Summer is here " ? Could n't I keep track of earliest and latest blossoms ? Measure the girths of trees ? Record the temperaturesof bodies of water ? I could . But the summer I wanted was more than a keyhole life . Summer was more than something to be experienced with thermometer and tape measure , recorded with fountain pen . Where was some sundial of human hair in whose bleaching I could keep track of the passage of the sun-stricken days ? Blix , Blix ! I thought of Blix . I still feel the pressure of the screen door against my upper arm as that good thought came to me . " Ask Blix . Ask Blix . " If only she would walk the zinnia rows with me , listen to the Mexican songs with me , speculate with me about the amount of haze mixed with crimson it took to make an " African sunset . " The bang of the screen door was still echoing in my ears when I took down the phone.  |p166Blix  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tassie ? " We did n't make long-distance calls in those days just for thefun of talking . I had to reassure her before I could tell her myidea . " Spend the summer here , Blix . Please do . We could have a lot of fun . " " I 've put fun out of my life . " " You could make money , then . You have n't put money out of your life , have you ? " " Tell me more . " " Everett 's going to be a big-time operator this year . There 'll be all kinds of jobs . " " Cutting apricots ? No , thanks . " " You could be a cutting-shed supervisor and see that the others do the job right . " " What Mother wants me to do is to find a husband . I 'd be glad to be able to stop hearing about that for a while . " " Do n't you want a husband ? " " Sure , I want a husband . But not just anyone . You got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can have your choice . Milt Hollister is only a half a mile down the road . " " Is he rich ? " " A rich , bald widower . " " A widower ? How old is he ? " " Twenty-five or six . " " Any kids ? " " No . " " What happened to his hair ? " " His hair ? Good heavens , I never asked him . It disappeared . Gradually , I suppose . His wife drowned . Caught in a rip tide at Newport . " " Well , that would n't happen to me . I can swim . " " Look , " I said , " there are plenty of men up here . And you can have a job if you want it . But I 'm asking you for my own sake , not yours . We could have a beautiful summer . " " Rich young hairless widowers ! That 's what would make myp167summer beautiful . Guarantee Mama that I can land him , and she 'll pay you room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to get me married . " " Blix , I 'm serious . " " Do n't think I 'm not . Or Mother . Here she is . She wants to talk to you . " There was a moment 's silence . Mother drying her hands on her apron and running in from the kitchen . My dream was summer . It was n't Blix 's dream . Would I never learn that dreams ca n't be shared ? Still less , imposed ? Walking down a zinnia row . Keeping track of sunset colors . Remarking on heat records . Fine work for a disappointed Henry Ryecroft or stoical Marcus Aurelius . The old , the unmated , the timid , the resigned . Blix was a young girl looking for a man . Not resigned yet . Mama was n't either . " Petty ? What 's this about Everett having a job for Blix ? " " It 's a fact . In the dry-shed . She could clear two or three hundred dollars if she wanted to . " " Well , my gosh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her than here . She 's out every night with a different boy . Go , go , go . That 's her whole creed and doctrine . Get away from this crew and make some money , too ! And you 'd be such a good influence on her , petty . " " Do n't count on that . I 'm reaching the dangerous age . " " Do n't joke . Blix 'll ruin her health carrying on like this . She ought to be married . " " I ca n't promise that . " " You 'd help her . You 'd be just what she needs . Have you got room for Blackie up there , too ? " " Do you want him married off ? " " It would be a relief . But who 'd have him ? No , I want him on a ranch and working . And earning his school clothes . Can Everett use him ? " " Sure . He 'll need more workers than he can find . " " I do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Blix both , if it do n't suit . " " It 's suits fine , " I assured Mother . " It makes my summer . "  |p168It  did . But not the summer I had dreamed of . Though I ca n't honestly say that I was n't with the summer that happened . Blix and Blackie arrived at four o'clock on a Saturday afternoon . I had expected them sooner . I thought they 'd start early to avoid driving in the heat of the day . But Blix was always a slow starter , an evening girl . I heard her Model T coupe turn in the driveway . There was no mistaking it . It was made up of loose parts ; each kept its own time , and played its own tune . I could n't see the car until it passed the kitchen windows ; and all I could do then by way of greeting was to shout . I was busy with something that could n't be dropped . Blix and I , twenty-five years later , talked about her arrival that distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights of frequent waking and short , drugged sleeping , we had discovered that certain memories were gateways through which we could enter the past . Not all memories were gateways . Some proved , unexpectedly , to be walls ; and some of these walls , in addition to barring entrance , were flinty and hard , studded with glass and nails . I slammed Blix against such a wall once . My intention , I believe , was good ; though it seems to me now ( undrugged , unsleepy ) to have been at the very least stupid , possibly sadistic . Jesus , Jesus ! I offered that intelligent woman on her deathbed the wicked comfort of , " Look how much worse it might be . Look what others have also suffered ! " What kind of solace is that ? Ask someone burdened by fate to contemplate the greater burdens fate has imposed on another ? Nevertheless I did it . I showed her the picture of " how it might have been , " complete with details . I told her of the death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a mean , dirty little house set deep in a lonely woods , " I told her . " On a muddy lane off the main road.  |p169It  was the fifth move that year . There was no one near that she knew . No friends . No relations . No money . Bedfast . In pain . She wrote Father : ' If I had two dollars I would invest it in a bottle of port wine . Joel ' ( her youngest son ) writes me that he knows a woman with my trouble that two bottles cured . ' " Blix said very low , " Do n't , " then she turned away from me to face the wall . Our grandmother Lavinia Murphy had Blix 's " trouble . " She never got the two-dollar wine . In two months ' time she was dead . She would have died , wine or no wine . What had made me think that an account of the lonely , ignorant , poverty-stricken death of Lavinia Murphy would cause Blix to say , " Hurrah ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst I did . Slowly , making mistakes , we learned which were the " gateway " experiences , the experiences by which we could enter the past . They had one characteristic in common : they had to be experiences of love , of joy , of delight . Once inside , we might move on to happenings of any kind : ludicrous , painful , selfish , wicked . This did n't faze us . If the start had been right , we could tolerate them . They were a part of life . One miserable night , or one night that started miserable , while the infection , which later cleared up , still plagued her , Blix awakened and said , " Gosh , I think I 'm well . " She was n't but the antibiotics had suddenly taken hold . She felt convalescent , herselfagain . As late as that afternoon , every sign pointing downhill , Milt had said to me , " I do n't see anything for it but that handful of pills . " I had walked quickly away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more deeply involved than he ; but , like any other hypocrite , my mind was unwilling to face the word for the act . Now , only twelve hours later , Blix was lighting a cigarette , looking about her room with relish . " You fed me with a spoon while I was sick , did n't you ? " She spoke like a child who says , " I remember it snowed on my second birthday . " Something dreamy , long ago , and remembered with wonder.  | " You would n't let me feed you much , " I told her . " I 'm hungry now . " Few words have made me happier . " What ? Tell me what ? " " Clam chowder and coffee ice cream . " The clam chowder , thank God , was easy to make . Coffee ice cream is even easier : vanilla ice cream with instant coffee stirred in it . We had a feast , a festival , a resurrection . A bright night , still and clear , no coyotes , the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the days she 'd just been through , or the days yet to come . The past of past years , not the past of past days . She knew the entrance doorways as well as I , though we never spoke of them as such to each other , or even admitted they existed . Blix began our talk of that past summer in Brenner . " It was her earrings that made her so darling , I think , " Blix said . " And being naked . The two together . " Blix did n't have to say another word . We knew whose earrings . We 'd used those earrings before . They were a proved gateway . When Blix and Blackie came into the kitchen that hot Saturday afternoon in July , they saw at once why I had n't been able to run out to greet them . I had a Mexican baby in the sink , giving her a bath . She was naked , of course , except for her earrings . I would have taken them off , but her ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfasten them . " I 've always thought , " Blix said , " that that baby was the most beautiful child I 've ever seen . " " Not more beautiful than Sara . " Sara was Blix 's daughter . Perhapstonight the earrings would be the gate to Sara . But Blix 's thoughts did n't move in that direction . She continued to talk of Josephina Sanchez , the child I had been bathing . Josephina was two years old , brown by nature , but a coating ofp171dust and apricot juice usually gave her a pink-stucco tinge . When I finished washing her , she was brown again . I sat her on the sink board to dry her ; and drying , mixed with peek-a-booing and snuggling , took some time . Blix did n't leave , but she herself did no fondling , made no baby talk . Blix once told me that she had never been at ease with children , that she had not felt comfortable with her own daughter . " I was always self-conscious with Sara . I never could think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe . Blix talking to Sara sounded like a Republican senator attempting to converse with a sparrow . The senator 's predicament was more understandable than Blix 's . He had never been a sparrow . Blix had once been a child ; or , having had a child 's shape , we had taken her to be one . Who can tell about these things ? It is true she had always aligned herself with her parents , not with sister and brothers . " Us and the kids , " she 'd say to Mother and Father . And all kids , even her own child , remained strange to her . Once when she said she had n't been a good mother to her daughter , I tried to reassure her . " Sara , " I reminded her , " was a very special case . " This , whether or not it reassured Blix , was God 's truth . Sara was a female Le Cid , which is infinitely more special than being a male Le Cid . She was a mathematician , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Blix 's big , slant-set eyes . Blix agreed about Sara 's being a special case . " Sure , I know . How many kids have an I.Q. of 185 ? Or eyes that shade of violet ? But it would n't have made any difference if her I.Q. had been 90 and her eyes pale blue . Kids make me uncomfortable . " " Like a cat with a dog ? " " Oh no . Nothing like that . I 'm not mad at them . Or scared of them . I just do n't feel comfortable with them . " " Blix , " Sara once told me ( Sara called her father and mother , by their request , " Milt " and " Blix " ) , " never kissed me after I was ten years old . " " Not when you got your degrees ? Not when you were mar-ried ? "  | " No , never . " I did n't ask Sara why . I never asked Blix why ; and I do n't know why . Was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was she soured on touch ? Or children ? Or Mill 's child ? Was it a part of her dislike of demonstrativeness ? Of Mother 's uninhibitedgroans and belches ? Blackie 's bellowing ? My exuberance ? In any case , she did n't change . Before asking me to stay with her , Blix had made me promise that there 'd be no tears , no moans , no sighs . " I could n't stand it if you cried . " Though Blix had kept her distance when I dried and dressed Josephina , she went with me to return the baby to her mother . The Mexicans had set up their tents in the apricot orchard west of the house ; perhaps a hundred people , counting the children , were living there . It was like walking through a Mexican village . It was a Mexican village . Fires were burning , suppers cooking , goats blatting . Mexican men , through with work , were washing up at the weir box . Others were playing their guitars and singing . Handsome Domingo Garcia played his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shouting at their evening games . All girls over twelve had put on their best ( transparent georgette blouses and high-heeled patent-leather pumps , if they owned them ) and were parading amid the bean pots and campfires in a Brenner version of the paseo . I put Josephina in her mother 's arms . Mrs. Sanchez was a widow with seven children , all of whom , with the exception of Josephina , worked . The oldest son , Manuel , was in charge of sulphuring . Manuel , stripped to the waist , from his evening washdown , came to the Sanchez tent while Blix and I were there . Wet and dripping , he was smooth and sleek as a seal . He was part Indian , of course , but there was n't a thing of the local Sobobas , who were a pudding-faced lot , about him . His nose and jaw line had come to him from Spain with Cortez . Only his color was Mexico 's contribution . I was in love with Manuel . I did n't know whether Blix knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want her to know it . Before , I had never been ashamed of being in love . True , I did n't talk aboutp173it . Any more than I talked about John Keats 's death . Or what I would wish for if given three wishes . But I was n't ashamed of it . I did n't feel like an unfaithful wife . Or even a wife hoping to be unfaithful . I did n't , I suppose , coming right down to it , feel like a wife at all . What I felt in those previous " love affairs " was a schoolgirl infatuation for a storybook hero . The difference was that I wrote ( with my heart ) stories about heroes who were real . And I was real , too . Not a substitute for anyone . Not Fanny Brawne or Cathy Earnshaw . I was Tasmania Murphy , my own heroine . And if my storekeepers and bus drivers and track stars were no Sidney Cartons or Heathcliffs , they , at least , had more than ink in their veins . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really made much difference . ) It did then . What a real person felt for other real persons I considered real . And the secrecy enhanced it . I was love 's secret agent ; and no one guessed it ! I inhabited a magic world . Far from being ashamed of what I felt , I rejoiced in it . I possessed an unexpected treasure . I lived in an invisible world . A resolveto " be with " summer could have been made only by someone trying unconsciously to break away from unreality , to try the unusual experience of living where he was , a real part of a real season . What I felt about Manuel was what I felt about that particular summer . I had n't wanted to " be with " other summers . Any more than a child with a make-believe playmate wants that playmate to materialize . What he loves is make-believe , not playmates . It was the same with me . Or had been . My world of love had been a childlike world . My discontent with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ashamed of leading a life of make-believe ? I 'm not sure . Anyway , I did n't want make-believe with Manuel . I wanted to be with him , talk to him , touch him . Such desires I knew were shameful . And I wanted to hide them from Blix . First of all , I was supposed to be an example to her . And a married woman yearning after her husband 's sulphur foreman is not exemplary . Secondly , only six months ago I had been preaching red-hot non-touch sermons to Blix on the subject ofp174her and Vurl . True , I did n't know what I was talking about . That had n't kept me quiet . Sometimes you do n't know that the house you live in is glass until the stone you cast comes boomerangingback . Maybe that 's the actual reason you threw it . Somethingin you was yelling , " I want out . " The life you saved , as well as the glass you shattered , was your own . Apart from shamefulness , there was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all . " How crazy can you get ! " A case on a Mexican apricot worker , the chief support of a mother and six younger brothers and sisters . I knew the questions Blix would ask . " Has he any decent clothes ? Would you ride in that broken-down truck of his ? Would you take all the kids along ? What would you use for money ? What could you talk about ? Do n't you care anything about what John Everett would think ? " If I answered any of these questions truthfully , I would give everything away . Truck , money , kids , talks : I did n't care . As to John Everett , there was no problem . I could 've told John Everett all I felt , and he would have laughed merrily . If he had n't taken my conversations with God seriously , what would he think of my wish to know a greaser ? Silly . Nothing he could n't put an end to . " Who do you think you are ? Ramona ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many novels . Come on up to bed and I 'll give you the cure . " That 's what he would have said if I 'd told him . As it was , he did n't say anything about The Cure or anything else . He went off to bed every night very early . He yawned at the supper table ; he yawned and stumbled all the way up the stairs . He had begun to fear that he had bitten off more than he could chew . Dried-apricot prices were not holding up . If he failed to pick fruit at its prime , to dry and sulphur it perfectly , he might easily finish the summer bankrupt , owing the ranchers he had bought from , and with tons of unsalable dried fruit on hand . He was up at daybreak . He made a real effort to determine at which ranches fruit needed picking . It went against his grain to be anything but the bountiful padrone to his Mexicans , but hep175was firmer with them than he had ever been before . Rotten cots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutters , not plopped down on the trays , with seeds thumbed out . Kids were not to relieve themselves against the stacked trays of cut cots . Checkers were not to check their girl friends ' boxes twice . Pickers were not to shake trees of well-ripened fruit . The chances of getting a poor dry were endless ; and Everett , working to prevent this , was worn out by the end of the day . After supper , he would go into the living room , stretch out on the wicker settee , and open the week 's Saturday Evening Post . He never did more than open it . The very sight of the print put him to sleep . It lay opened across his chest , a pygmy pup tent , from each end of which Everett , eyes closed and stockinged toes twitching , extendedgigantically . Unlike Blackie , Everett did not resist being awakened . He opened his eyes easily and , though he stumbled , climbed the stairs docilely . Once Everett was in bed , Blackie and I were ready for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a hot summer dusk , supper fires quenched , cicadas and Mexican babies crying , guitars plaintive . Later , lights would go on in the cutting shed , and cutters , betweenseven-thirty and ten , would turn out as much work as they had between one and five . But at dusk there was a respite . At that hour it was cooler outside than inside . Doors shut all day were opened . The house exchanged its smells of applesauce , fried potatoes , and newly ironed clothes for wood smoke , chili , and the pungent brandy scent of rotten apricots . There were shadows in the corners of all rooms . A mockingbird , too hot till then to utter a note , imitated Domingo 's downward-sliding trill , liked it , and tried again . It was then Blackie would say , " Let 's go out and talk to Manuel about boxing , Tassie . " " All things work together for good for those who love the Lord , " Mama used to say humbly and reverently when some of her own sacrificial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , really ; an incantation used to convince the Lord that His creatureswere n't giving themselves credit for what was really allp176His doing . That saying would be a good deal more true if it stopped short of " the Lord . " All things work together for good for those who love . When Mother proposed that Blackie , as well as Blix , spend the summer on the ranch , I saw the summer I was longing to " be with " vanish . Heaven knows , I doted on Blackie , but with Blackie on the ranch , what I 'd be " with , " I feared , would be cookstove , skillet , and washboard . I doted on Blackie ; he was a man for all seasons , but which season was never very clear or important . And what I wanted that summer was summer . Not knowing yet that Manuel would be my summer . Only my love for Blackie had made it possible for me to answer Mama 's proposal with enthusiasm . " Of course . I 'd love to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love brought Blackie to the ranch ; and once there , he became love 's unwitting servant , providing me with excuses to be with Manuel . Blackie was mad about boxing , and the minute he heard that the Mexican in charge of sulphuring was Manuel Sanchez he gave a whoop . " Kid Sanchez ! What 's he doing here ? " " Working ! " " Working ! What 's he working for ? He could be middleweight champ . " Blackie was a boxing fan . He knew the histories of boxers , had memorized their statistics , could demonstrate their styles . He 'd seen Manuel fight at the Pico Arena . He knew all the fights he 'd been in , who he 'd knocked out , and in what round . He was an authority on Manuel 's specialties . Manuel was a boxer with a punch , the best and rarest combination in the world , according to Blackie . Sluggers usually had n't any skill ; and the ones with skill lacked a punch . Manuel was a killer , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he enjoyed fighting . He took a cat 's good and graceful time for the kill . It never occurred to Blackie that I was n't as fascinated listening to explanations of jabs , hooks , uppercuts , and kidney punches  |p177as  he was ; that the old one-two was n't as endlessly interesting to me as to him . He thought he was doing me a favor , inviting me to go with him to his boxing seminars . He was , of course . Josephinaprovided some excuse for my going out to the Sanchez tent , but I could see Josephina all day long when Manuel was n't there . Blackie sometimes asked Blix to go with us . But Blix did n't care for boxing . Or Manuel . And she had no intention of spendinga hot evening sitting on a field box in the midst of dust , beans , and kids , listening to Manuel , at Blackie 's prompting , refighthis fights . " You get Domingo to play his violin , and I 'll go with you , Blackie , " she told him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't interested in the handsome Domingo , so we never made the switch . Once in a while I said no to Blackie 's invitations . But I did n't have to do this often . Blix knew that where Blackie went , I went . But she was no dunce ; and she would have a hard time convincing herself that love of Blackie alone would make me endureso much prize fighting at second hand on sweltering evenings . I hoped she did n't notice the dresses I put on for these orchard refights , dresses of a kind I think do n't exist any more : " summer dresses " of voile , organdy , dotted swiss ; dresses ruffled , tucked , trimmed with rows of ribbon and lace . One yellow dress , I remember , had twelve rows of lace at the hem , eight at the scoop neck . I remember easily ; I had laboriously sewed all that lace on . The dress had been a part of my handmade trousseau . Another , a lavender voile , had swinging panels , encrusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new dresses . Their average cost , homemade , was probably $3.98 . But they were not apricotorchardor cutting-shed dresses , either . They were dresses that made me as pretty as possible ; that said , " Woman " ; dresses that said , " The day 's work is over . " I was aware , as I walked with Blackie to the Sanchez tent , of the soft sibilance of those full skirts rustling about my knees . Aware of a neckline scooped lowp178enough to show the first rise of bosom , of puff sleeves displaying rounded arms , of the scent of Yardley 's violets . All of these awarenessesI added together , in an attempt to sum up for me something , some question still unanswerable , some yearning unnamable , and for which I wanted an unknown response . Manuel was always waiting for us . If he had to be looking after the sulphuring , he would leave word that he would stop by whenever he had time . I took heart from this . Other Mexican young men went into town after work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apricots and near-beer . Or they went deep into the orchard with the high-heeled girls . But Manuel was always either at his tent or working ; he was always washed , combed , in a clean shirt , a shirt he had laundered himself . I knew . From my bedroom window I could see him , early in the morning , washing it . He hung it on one of the guy ropes of his tent ; by nightfall it was dry , unironed , but fresh and clean . It occurred to me , of course , that Manuel , having been a boxer , might enjoy talking about himself and boxing even more than Blackie enjoyed listening , that he would have turned up as faithfullyeach night if Blackie 's sister had been Blackie 's grandmother . It occurred to me that Manuel , knowing which side his bread was buttered on , and hoping that there might be a winter job for a good worker , was more interested in his boss 's response to him than the response of his boss 's wife . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linger . They belittled Manuel . It was not necessary , in order to inure myself against disappointment , to attribute vanity and self-seeking to someone else . I choose to believe in the reality of the goodness that I felt , to believe in the closeness , beyond words , that I experiencedas Manuel explained and illustrated boxing techniques to Blackie . He often looked at me . His look , it seemed to me , was like the one I gave him in return : grave , fond , and admiring ; though what he could admire about me , except that I wore pretty dresses and was good to his family , I did n't know . Manuel possessed that teeter-totter combination of tenderness and toughnessthat provides just the tension emotionally a woman desires.  |p179She  wants and admires both , will follow either , but a balancing of the two holds her . So there was Manuel , the boxer with a k.o. punch who had given it all up to be a father to his six brothers and sisters . And there was I , late admirer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was summer and I was with it . Workers handsomer than Manuel were camped in our apricot orchard that summer . Mexicans , delicately boned , liquid-eyed , with silky down-drooping mustaches ; blocky toro boys with obsidianeyes , who once had used the obsidian knives on the old sacrificial altars . Manuel was neither of these : a young man of medium height ; on the stocky side ; brown , not black , hair ; a mouthful of white , though crooked , teeth . But possessing that **25;7133;TOOLONG teeter-totter . Blix was with me all that summer , free to see all that there was to be seen . But she had a real , not an imaginary , courtship on her hands ; Milt Hollister was providing more interesting things for her to do than to listen to her kid brother , her married sister , and an ex-boxer talk prize fighting . And I did n't tell her a thing . I had the habit of silence . My daydream love affairs had been too unreal to talk about . By talk , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning cheeks a grocer put potatoes in a sack ! Had I mentioned that , the sound of my own words would have made me laugh . How ridiculous ! I could n't speak about Manuel for the opposite reason . He was too real . A word would tell what I really felt  --  and I was ashamed of what I really felt . I could and did talk to Blackie . He thought my passion for Manuel was a passion for boxing  --  a passion he considered natural.  |p180During  our autumn nights of alternating sleeplessness and drugged sleep , Blix and I often spoke of that long past summer . We had been in it together . But at the time , we had been tonguetied . Or unobservant . Or bashful . Now in our nights of pain and joy , we made each other gifts of what then we had withheld . Sometimes , in the midst of talking , insights , as new to speaker as to listener , came to us . We were mutually amazed . Silenced . How could we have been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer became our autumn rewards . We did n't seek them . That would have invalidated them . They sought us . Oh , they did . They came rushing . They shook us with truths palpable , but unimagined . " So that was it . " " That was what he was trying to say . " " That was what I really wanted . " Blix would narrow her drug-dilated eyes . She would take a sharpshooter 's bead on a truth momentarily glimpsed : was it real ? It was real . It was God 's truth , some years delayed , but sure as shooting now . She would lean back against her pillows , smiling . In the midst of death we had discovered instant life . Formula : mix the memories of two people around a single past event andp181reconstitute with nighttime knowledge . We did n't create somethingthat never was : we created persons , able at long last to see what had actually been . All of our illuminations were n't mutual . We achieved some solo . Blix , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't made easier by hearing of a harder one . It was in the midst of my account of Grandma Murphy 's death , in that lonely house in the dark woods , that I learned this . Never since have I tried to solace a man torn by dogs with reminders of Christians and lions . Some discoveries , perhaps mutual , perhaps not , were never mentioned . I rediscovered clowning . It is the means by which we are able to contemplate tragedy without tears . It was n't a new act for me . I had been a great clown when young . My life , growinghappier as I grew older , had less need of the act . When I was young , the only differences between me and Chaplin were sex , size ( I was larger ) , a mustache and money . Chaplin was paid in money ; I was paid in attention . I was paid in the greatest prize of all : irresponsibility . I could take the coward 's escape : say it , then disavow it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? For heaven 's sake ! I was only kidding . " For Blix 's sake ( I thought ) I took up my clowning again . The insights of another decade may reveal that my clowning then , as earlier , was a clown 's escape . Coward 's , I meant to say . One real insight , though , was that life is actually funny , downrighttragically absurd . " Side-splitting , " Blix said , " though what I 've been is belly-split , not side-split . " The comic ca n't be manufactured for however good a purpose . You can shed a false tear and fool yourself . The false laugh wo n't even fool a listener . The comic is inherent ; otherwise nonexistent . It ca n't be laid on . During our long autumn dialogue , Blix and I laughed a lot . Not loud , not loud . " White on the winter night , your breath is cloud . " We knew that . But when the paroxysm of laughter grabbed our stomachs , we did n't hold back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny insights , were happy . Were amazed to be happy . " How can this be ? " we asked ourselves . We did n't " look on the bright side . " After my horrible story of Grandma Murphy there was no more saying , " Things could be worse . " I pretended nothing to spare Blix , nor she me . When she told me that she did n't want me around if I was going to do a lot of crying , she was n't thinking of the wear and tear on me , but on her . Neither Blix nor I believed that this life was a preparation for another . This was it . A sleep would round it off ; and sleep was not far away . Still we laughed . We remembered . We listened to the wind and the coyotes . We turned on the TV . We had callers . We discussed them . We ate and commented on the quality of the food . He scanned headlines . We were amazed by early rain , delighted with Dr. Reyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ? " we asked . " How can it be ? " We talked about it . Our happiness was strong enough to bear looking at . No more resentment . We knew that . A return to the pattern in which we had grown up . Big sister , protective ; little sister , dependent . Youth , in that . Dailiness . The time being short gave us time for each day 's events . We were n't getting through today for the sake of tomorrow . The gains were all chiefly mine . I knew that . They were gifts Blix gave me . In the first place , I was n't dying . That was n't her gift ; and yet by dying she enhanced my living . We both knew that . In her bed , she pointed out to me pleasures I took for granted : running and jumping . Breathing . Blowing my nose . Seeing the dark come down . There was another gift she made me . I had discovered earlier , with Mama , the power complete physical devotion has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or anyone else , an iota of the nurse in me . Schoolmates who dreamed of being nurses filled me with distaste . They seemed to verge on the unwholesome . Perhaps it was this very distaste , conquered , that made my care of Mama so transfiguring.  |p183She  was often ailing ; painfully at home , desperately in hospitalsafter serious operations . In the hospitals she was always at loggerheads with everyone ; with the possible exception of some handsome young doctor with a sense of humor . A hospital by definition is a place where when they make tea , water results . This went against Mother 's grain . So did hot-water bottles halffilled , toast half-cold , and nurses halfhearted . She went against the nurses ' grain . They dearly loved a quiet sufferer , a patient who swallowed without protest whatever was handed her , who would suffer rather than ring for a bedpan , who , when asked , " How are we feeling this morning ? " never told the truth . Mother did none of this . In sickness she did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sickness , irritatedby pain , she became less so . She lifted the covers and gave indifferent nurses unexpected and galvanizing kicks . If a bedpan was n't forthcoming , she moaned , groaned , and shouted . " Is n't she deft , " Mother said to me , syrupy-sweet , of a nurse bumbling about her bedside . " Did she call me daft ? " the nurse demanded , getting the drift , if missing the word . So I was often Mama 's nurse . With nursing , as with summer , the only criterion is , " Are you with it ? " At the patient 's bedside you can not lead your life . If you are to have any life at all , it must be his . You must become his hands , his feet , his ears and eyes . Suffer with him , if not for him . The stinks , the sweats , the complaints , the horrid sounds . Be with them and emerge sanctified . Not because of unselfishness . Or love . Or devotion . Becauseof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , crime , and creativity . And nursing also if practiced to the point of sweat and sell-forgetfulness and identification . Eased by my efforts , Mother sometimes held out her supple long-fingered hand . " Oh , petty , " she 'd say , complete understandingof what you 'd clone in those words . Whether she spoke or not , I had blessed myself with my act . Two people united in an act of love ; the calm that follows is pretty much the same , whatever the act.  |p184Mother  did n't change so long as she had breath in her lungs . Once she wrote me , " My poor dear Tassie . " ( There was nothingwrong with me . ) " I feel like I 've had a breast carved off . " ( She had . ) " Woe is me . My meals are brought to me . My medicineis poured out and put into my mouth . My kinfolk have failed me and my familiar friends forgotten me . They that dwell in my house count me for a stranger . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edibles and give me the others . Yea , and though get-well cards give great pleasure , yet crave I the edible tidbits  --  or at least to see them . Yea , curiosity eateth me like as a cat devoureth a mouse . " I am stripped of my glory and destroyed on every side .. . especially the right front side . " My sighing cometh before I eat and my roarings are poured forth like the waters , for the thing I greatly feared hath come upon me . I was born not for safety , neither have I rest . Know ye I am down and out . Doth the wild ass bray when he has fodder ? Or loweth the ox when the grass is under his nose ? " Therefore I will refrain not my mouth , for my nose was blistered with anesthetics and my fodder is withheld . When I lie down I say , When shall I rise and the nite be gone ? And I would be full of tossings to and fro until the dawning of day if it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am full of codeine and would I were out in the woods and covered with a tarpaulin . " Thus with Biblical rhythms she rocked her pain to sleep and dreamed of finding ease in the woods of her childhood , woods that did n't exist in Southern California . What 's your reply to a letter like that ? Or to a phone call like this ? Father : Your mother is wandering in her mind . Tassie : What makes you think so ? Father : She says she is seeing things . Tassie : What kind of things does she see ? Father : Nitwits . She says she is surrounded by nitwits . Tassie : Who is there ? Father : No one at all . Not a soul but me and the doctor.  |p185I  smiled . It was a cheerful report . Mama was in her right mind and absolutely herself . But what 's your reply to a phone call like that ? On a cold January night at the beginning of her final illness she arose in the middle of the night and lighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire of newspapers and pine kindling . She managed it well , and warmed herself without bothering anyone . In the befuddlement of a stroke 's aftermath , she had forgotten that the wood fires of her Kentucky girlhood had been replaced by gas . And she had been comforted as well as warmed , no doubt , by the sight and smell of a wood fire . The unimaginative healthy asked only : " Why did n't she light the gas ? " Prophesied only , " She 'll burn the house down . " Blamed themselves not at all for failure to keep an invalid 's room warm . Placed finally , for such reasons , in a place neither homelike nor restful , and for these reasons called a " rest home , " she turned her face to the wall , and never again looked out of the door through which she had been led to her betrayal . Too diffidentto express her religious yearnings , she had neither Bible nor preacher to comfort her . A horse in his stall dies surrounded by more of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kind of momentary intuition , I recited to her a poem I had learned as a girl : Whittier 's " I know not where His islands lift their fronded palms in air : I only know I can not drift beyond His love and care . " The words soothed her . Her hands unclenched ; the lids over her eyes relaxed . She lifted a finger and kept tremulous time to the marching beat of the verse . I said it through twice . As I began for the third time , she opened her eyes and gave me her old green-eyed look of lively scorn . " Do n't you know anything else ? " she demanded tartly . I dredged my mind for something Biblical , and found more than I had ever known was there . Mother , though I was neither ordained nor accurately Scriptural , accepted me as a substitute better than nothing . The last time I saw her , three days before her death , she mistookme for her own mother . " Mama , " she said , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round , " I told her . " You 're the mama , not me . " Her look was both mischievous and shrewd . " It does n't matter much which way it goes , just so one of us is . " The death of her body did n't trouble me greatly . Her body was sixty-three years old and worn out . The dust of bodies layers the earth . Mice and mosquitoes are killed in every home . Childrenare run over . Hunters travel thousands of miles to get a good rack of horns . We weigh down our tables with the flesh of the meek and the frolicsome . Dust to dust is the appointed round of flesh . But what about dreams ? What about the dreams of Maude Hobhouse ? What I mourned when Maude Hobhouse died was the death of her dreams . Built of love and fear and misinformationand talent , she 'd raised a tower of dreams ; and was still at it when she died . It was an edifice I was at home in , and a home I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was easy to care for . She was not completelybedfast ; she wanted no recitations of John Greenleaf Whittier . I could not achieve sanctification by sweat with her . But I had the same bedside happiness . Some war was over , some peace achieved . Was it a war I had lost ? Had I accepted enslavement ? If so , enslavement was what I 'd always craved . Nothingto be proud of : the goal of masochists ; the pulse-quickener of enamored women . But inside of this enslavement , if that was what it was , I found freedom . Freedom from choice . I had a nun 's happiness . My vocation enveloped me . Of course I was n't relinquishing much . Pete was more or less lost to me at that time anyway . I never followed him around to the tournaments . I had a leave of absence from my job . About the only thing I no longer had time for ( or interest in ) was the history of the Hobhouse family , begun ten years before Mama died as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , partly because I thought she 'd be pleased to have it completed , partly because I was mulish . And possibly because , as Blix had said long ago , I had a yen for the unobtainable . The past is a mystery . We canp187never recover even a part of it , absolutely . The present surroundsus . Anyone can take an easy handful . For that reason I undervalued the present and pursued the past . In Blix 's room all that changed . In Blix 's room I saw the present becoming the past . I saw that departure was more mysteriousthan the departed . I saw that what had vanished ( all those Hobhouses ) was easier to reconstruct  --  who 's to contradict you ?  --  than the present . Blix , on her bed , with make-up , French twist , and time bomb ticking away inside her , was far more of an enigma than any Hobhouse I could " re-create . " The puzzles you make up , you can solve . Miss Historical Hobhouse would in large part be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is unexplainable . Blix , dying , reconciled me to the present . Death canceled out all the blandness , all the banalities of the present . Its silence smothered the hum of air conditioners , refrigerators , jets , automobiles , power lawn mowers , electric can openers , and carving knives . Was death then what I cared for ? No , life . Life is so much more dangerous and uncertain . Mama 's Hobhouses , moving westward , had lost their meaning for me . The frontier was right there in Blix 's room . She was the only explorerI had ever seen . She was going to cross a river deeper than the Missouri , wider than the Mississippi . Blix did n't worry a whit about poor Pete , three strokes off the lead in the Portland Open . She did n't worry about my job . She did worry about Hobhouses . She considered them my peculiar concern , a grail I had chosen to follow . She did n't want to be responsible for my defection . I could n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That would have made her feel guilty . Made her feel that she had robbed me of something I held dear . And how was I to explain to her what I did n't understand myself ? " Your dying has reconciled me to the present " ? How could I say that ? I could n't . I said , " I would never have thought I could be happy here . . . now , doing just what I am . " Blix answered , " Me , too . Is n't it strange ? " Stranger for Blix than for me , of course . I was n't dying . In myp188prison I had found freedom . In hers she was awaiting , after suitable torture , execution . Only , that was the point . She did n't propose to be tortured or to keep her date with the executioner . What Blix was planning was an escape . Because , when she had written me saying , " Sister , dear sister , " I had answered , " I am with you in this all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the escape . Plotting is perhaps the better word . Dr. Reyes was the only one we hoped to win over . There were plenty of others who had to be outwitted . Blix had been condemned . Almost everyone wanted to see that the sentence was properly carried out . Everyone except Pete , Milt , Le Cid , and I. " The hell with the others , " Blix said when we discussed them . " It 's my funeral . " So we planned , plotted , organized , lied . The supplies were laid in , the risks calculated , emergencies , to the best of our ability , foreseen . " We 'll outfox them , wo n't we , Tassie ? " I thought we would . We were like those prisoners in The Bridge Over the River Kwai . We were so busy building the bridge we had no time to worry about who , finally , was going to use it . We never talked about it , but this may have been the chief reason for our happiness . We had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what this future was . Also , in addition to the pleasure of planning , we experienced the downright mean satisfactionsof craftiness and defiance . We were putting something over on quite a few people . This gave Blix a lot of satisfaction . She was choosing . She was not a victim . The first thing Blix said when I saw her in the morning ( I awakened later than she did ) was , " Are they still there ? " That was the second thing , actually . The first was to send Vida , the day nurse , off on some errand . Not until Vida had gone could Blix ask me that question . Those pills meant everything to her ; and it was Vida 's duty as a dedicated nurse to smell them out and confiscate them . Vida was no match for Blix and me , though . " Our only trouble , " I told Blix , " is that we 're going to hidep189these pills someday in some such far-out place neither one of us will be able to remember where . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always where we remembered them . Recently , talking with Pete of those nights of hiding and mornings of looking , he surprised me by asking , " Would n't it have been more logical to put those pills under lock and key and have been done with your games of hide-and-seek ? " The question surprised me for two reasons . First , because such an idea had never at the time , or since , occurred to me . And second , because Pete is usually more understanding than that . What did logic have to do with what was going on in that room ? And how many games did we have left to play ? As well suggest to children playing blindman 's bluff that they could find each other more easily if they took the blindfold off . They do n't want it easy . Blix did n't want it easy . There were very few ways left , except in the endurance of pain , in which she could demonstrateher powers . Fooling the bright-eyed Vida was one of them . She was not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoked too much , and danced too long , to live without risk . Life had been lived with risk . Death , which is life 's last act , she would move toward precariously . " Perhaps , " Pete said , " she really wanted the pills to be found . Perhaps she really wanted to be spared at the final moment . She , strong and willing  --  but the pills nowhere to be found . " " I think , " I told Pete , fumbling to explain an act that had at the time seemed to me to have no alternative , " that Blix was willing to give the other side a sporting chance . If they had the power and luck to win , okay . But I could never have said to Blix  --  even if the idea had occurred to me  --  and it did n't , I ' 11 just lock these pills up , Blix , and put an end to our hide-andseek . ' I could n't have done it . There was too much that was inevitablein that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You could 've controlled those pills absolutely , " Pete said , " with a little better planning . " " ' Absolutely ' was what we did n't want . We wanted a taste of victory fresh and not inevitable each day . "  |p190Pete  said , " I was n't actually criticizing you girls , you know . " " Yes you were . You were criticizing us for not being men and not being well and not sizing up the situation objectively . My God , Pete , how much golf would you play if the whole situation was cut and dried ? " " Golf 's a game , not a matter of life and death . " " Life and death was the only game we had . And we played it . Inside a chanceless pattern we took some chances . " I do n't know whether Pete ever really understood or not . Even after I 'd explained how it had really happened , he kept thinking of more sensible ways of taking care of those pills . Locking them in my suitcase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have a suitcase key to my name . And knows , or should know , that if they had been locked there , we would have played the same game even more hazardously with a small easily lost key . There is somethingterribly circumstantial about even the best masculine mind . Like Papa , more interested in the radio tubes than in any word or song it might produce . In any case , whatever we should have done , what we did was to hide those pills in a variety of places in Blix 's room . Actually , with her there constantly , the biggest risk we took probably was losing them ourselves . We never did ; and once they were located , we went over the Escape Plan . Refined and embellished it . Tom and Huck could n't have been more excited planning their trip . Big river ahead . Raft to equip and launch . Authorities to hoodwink . Extreme danger . Unimaginable adventures . All , Blix 's gift to me . She , the daring Huck . I the go-along ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have n't any problems , " Blix said . I did n't say anything . I knew he was our problem but I did n't have any solution . " He 's your problem , " Blix added . " How 's he mine ? " " You know he 's not going to talk about this with me . It 's not a thing a doctor does with his patient . " " He has n't shown any inclination to do it with his patient 's sister . "  | " It 's you or no one , " Blix said . For a long time I thought it was going to be no one . What more could I say to Dr. Reyes ? ( Dr. Reyes called Blix , Blix ; and me , Tassie . But we never called him John , let alone Johnny ; he was far too dignified and intense for that . ) Occasionally Dr. Reyes reversed his schedule : visited Blix on his way to the hospital instead of on his way home . When he did this he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awaiting him that could n't be postponed in the way , homeward bound , he could postpone dinner . On these morning visits he often brought Blix flowers from his own garden , flowers he grew himself . He was proud of them . One morning at the beginning of October , after his usual perfunctory knock , he came striding down the hall to Blix 's room , bearing a great armload of desert roses , sun-blasted and sand-pitted . There was nothing amiss with their color , though . Saffrons and yellows and bronzes . Or with their warm cinnamony fragrance . " They 're a little wilted , " he told Vida . " But you put them in a big jar of tepid , not cold , water , and they 'll come out of it in fine shape . " After Vida left , Dr. Reyes told us the most he ever had about his life . " A doctor with an armload of roses . Grown in my own yard . Beside my own pool . Looked after by my own gardener . You ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He was n't bragging . He was n't even rejoicing . He was simply summing things up , holding in his mind 's eye his past and his present . He tried to tell us how it had been : hard enough for any poor boy to find the money for a medical education . Almost impossible for a Mexican . " Who 'd hire a Mexican doctor if you did get licensed ? Except another Mexican . And they do n't have any money to pay . ' My own father said that . "  | " What did your mother say ? " " She said , You can do it . ' I made it hard for my father and mother . When she encouraged me she seemed to my father to be against him . Against Mexicans and for whites . She seemed to him to be encouraging me to take a stand against him . " " Mexicans and whites , ' " I said . " Do n't talk that way , Dr. Reyes . As if we were n't all human beings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Orcino , " he said with unwonted formality , " and you know it . We 'd better learn to face the way we really live with words . ' Mexicans and whites . ' We live that way even now . Better than when I was a boy , but still that way . " " But the pool . The gardener . The roses . Your reputation . " " Okay , " said Dr. Reyes . " My reputation . My skill . My training . My license . Take those away and what 's left ? A peculiar-looking greaser . I 'm back where my father was , climbing those date trees . " I 'd always admired those men on their fifty-foot ladders . " That 's not so bad , " I argued . Dr. Reyes said , " It 's bad if there 's something else you can do and want to do and would be better at . I do n't want to climb ladders . Washing dishes is n't such a bad job . You want to have to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , " I told him , " I do n't . I 'd fight it . I was praising your father , not defending a system . " " He was part of the system . The system said my mother , who was a good teacher , a high-school teacher of English , could n't teach any more . Just touching a man the color of my father took away everything she 'd learned at Stanford and in the classroom . I 'm better off than she was . No one can fire me . I 'm licensed to practice medicine . And as long as I 'm good at it , and hang onto that license , no one can stop me . " Okay . We knew what he was saying : " Look what I have at stake . " We knew what he had at stake . He did n't have to talk about it . We did n't want him to talk about it . People can change if they are n't bound by the memory of some earlier inflexible declaration of policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of policy . When the time came we could n't believe that he would n't be with us . After Dr. Reyes left , Blix said , " Who does he remind you of ? Someone we knew somewhere ? " " Domingo , " I told her . " The violin player at Brenner . " Blix gazed backward toward that lost summer , backward andbackward until she saw Domingo . " Yes , but Domingo was a littlela-di-da . I bet he 'd faint at the sight of blood . You should see Dr.Reyes at the hospital . He had those nurses going tippy-toe . " " His mother must 've been quite a woman . " " To marry a handsome Mexican ? " " She probably knew what she would have to give up . For the handsomeness . " Blix looked at me . " I suppose she did . " A week later Dr. Reyes stopped in , as was more usual , on his way home from the hospital , too tired , he said , for beer . " Blix , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me make a little examination . One finger , " he said , holding up a stubby forefinger , " one minute , is all it will take . " " What good would that do ? " " It would do you the good of letting me know better what kind of medication you need . " " I can tell you that without an examination . More . " " How many shots did you have last night ? " " Three . " " The third was a little heavy , " I said . " Four was what I really needed . " " You really do n't need a doctor , do you ? " " Not if you 'll sign me some blank prescription forms . " " That 's the way I make my money . " I walked Dr. Reyes through the house to the kitchen . He paused to look out of the window over the sink . A covey of quail had come out of the shade of the greasewood to hunt food . They were as thin and brittle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat ? "  |p194Dr  . Reyes did n't hear me . Perhaps he did n't even see the quail . " She 's got a low threshold of pain , " he said . " I know that . I 'm the same . I understand her . But the medication 's got to be spaced . She 'll pay for it later on . " We were back where we 'd been before . I did n't think there was any point in my reminding Dr. Reyes once again that Blix was n't planning for a later on . He expected me to say it . He looked at me , expecting it . I did n't say a word . He had to argue with himself . " I 've got to think of her , " he said . I nodded . He turned away from the window , climbed onto one of the stools at the breakfast bar . He supported his head on his hands , and his black curly hair , too long , sprang upward through his fingers . He needed a haircut  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . Clip down to his fingers . " Any beer over there ? " he asked , nodding toward the refrigerator . There was . I poured him a glass . It was two thirds empty when he put it down . " That 's good stuff . Are n't you having any ? " " I 'll have some later with Blix . " " I thought she 'd stopped drinking . " " She pretends a little  --  for me . " " When Blix 's weaker , she 'll have to come back to the hospital . " " There 's no law about that , is there ? The undertakers have things organized so that you have to be buried from their parlors . There 's no law about being sick in hospitals , is there ? " " Law ? Of course there 's no law . You 'll want her there your-self . " I did n't say anything . Dr. Reyes said , " Was that the last of the beer ? " I poured him another glass . " You 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free as they were . " " Do n't worry about Vida . She 's been taken care of . " " ' Taken care of . ' You talk like a gangster . You planning on machine-gunning Vida ? "  | " Do n't worry about Vida , " I told him again . He told me again , " I have n't prescribed a thing in any quantity that 's going to be useful to you . " " I know that . You 've been very ethical . Very careful . We do n't blame you . But there 's nothing you can do now , is there ? " " Rob you , do you mean ? Turn you over to the law ? " " That 's what I mean , I guess . " Dr. Reyes poured the rest of his beer into his glass , built up a fine creamy head , then stared at it without drinking . " They all think they can do it , " he once again reminded me . " I 'll be with her . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpers are all convinced they can help , too . In the beginning , anyway . " He finished his beer , and left without saying another word . I went to the refrigerator , got a bottle of beer for myself , sat down on the stool Dr. Reyes had vacated , and drank from the bottle . On Friday of the second week of my stay with Blix , she had said to me , " Tomorrow night 's the right time . " I was in the bed beside her when she said that . With those words there was a pause in everything : the wind , the hum of the air conditioner , the flow of my blood . Planning for the future is one thing . Saying " Tomorrow night " is another . After a while I said , very casually , " Why tomorrow night ? " " Everything fits . Sara 's coming for a visit in the afternoon . Mill leaves early Sunday morning for that convention in San Francisco . Dr. Reyes never comes on Sunday . The timing 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I could breathe again . I could hear again . " ' The timing 's perfect ' ! " I was outraged . " What you 're proposing is nasty . I 'm with you in this . You know that . But I 'm not with you in anything planned simply to make things convenient for Sara and Mill . A slick bit of timing . My God ,  |p196life  is all we 've got . There are various good reasons for parting with it . You 've got one . But if all life has meant to you is arrangingwhat 's convenient for Mill and Sara , the hell with it . I 'm going home . I prefer arranging what 's convenient for Pete . " Anytime you tell me I 've had it , ' I 'm with you . But do n't make life trivial . I had enough of that in my own life . I threw a lot of my own life away . " I do n't know when or how I 'll die . But it 's not going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any visitor . Daughter or no daughter . Our lives have n't been perfect . One way or another we 've wrecked quite a lot of life . Left quite a bit of it unlived . Let 's finish up in some kind of style . Part with it , yes . We 've all got to . But not for something convenient . " The light had been turned off . Blix snapped it on . She lifted herself on one elbow and stared at me . " You mean that , do n't you ? " " It was n't a fairy tale . " Blix said , " Tassie , I was thinking as much about your convenienceas Milt 's or Sara 's . " I saw that this was probably true . " Blix , " I said , " make me one last big gift . Let me believe that I value something more than my own convenience . Could you do that ? " " I could try . " " I 'm not very proud of myself with Mama in her last days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with your pride . " " It is , though . You know that . " " How am I going to know when the time comes ? " " Your hand will know . " " My hand ? " " It will reach out for that bottle . It will know . It 's not doing that now , is it ? " " No . " " This was just a scheme of your mind . Just a little plan mapped out like a crossword puzzle . " " We 've got to plan and scheme . You know that . "  | " We 've got to plan and scheme to be ready when your hand reaches , that 's all . When you were born , nobody set an exact date . It was going to happen ; they knew that . Some preparations were made . And when your body was ready to come , it came . It got some help . But it knew when it was ready . It will know when it 's ready to leave . We 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor wo n't help us now . " " We do n't need him . Babies are born without doctors . People die without them . " Blix held out her small , long-fingered hand . She opened and closed it . " My hand will know ? " " It will . Without your giving the matter a thought , it will reach for the pills . " The idea pleased Blix . " I would have to make it reach now , " she admitted . So she stopped worrying about " the time . " When the time came , her hand would know . So for a while the life she had was a gift . She had renounced it , and it had been returned to her . She had a week of unbelievableease . She sat out on the lanai and ordered rearrangementsof furniture and plants as if she 'd be out there every afternoonfrom then on . A week after the Saturday that was to have been " the time , " she watched the season 's new television shows . Most of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a one of these , " she said wonderingly . Every leaf , shoestring , cup and saucer ; every fly rubbing its legs together . She looked at them all . I think I know what it was like . After the Christmas tree had been stripped of all presents , you find way in the back , under the lowest branches , a final unexpectedgift . It outshines all the others . Blix 's unexpected gift was life . And I sat beside her , the life-giver . I had said the words that had given her new TV shows and shoestrings . Yes , and coyotes and wind and sand-pocked roses and trembling caramel custards . I was happy . I was Godlike . Who besides God had ever been able to make such gifts ? It was happiness . It was also power.  |p198Talk  about Big Brother . Big Sister can be dangerous , too . A live-giver , a life-sustainer . How small a gift of that kind would finally satisfy me ? " She took a sip . " " She smiled at me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She opened her eyes . I 'm pretty sure she knew where she was . " Would I become an addict ? Unwilling , unable to part from the invalid whose life I sustained ? Was that what Dr. Reyes had been telling me ? Had I been wrong in thinking that my problems , unlike his and Blix 's , were purely technical ? His Oath would tell him what to do . Blix 's hand would tell her . What could I rely on ? No Oath . No pain to prompt my hand . And a growing relish for my role as the great good giver of all things . " She smiled , she smiled . " ( I made her smile . ) Could I part with that ? Could I part with her ? Like Dr. Reyes , I drank a second beer . A milky ribbon of sand , down on the floor of the valley , was growing larger . The wind was already blowing down there . Before morning we would hear the dry clatter of palm fronds and the scrape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed the road and was stalking the quail . If he caught one , what would he have but feathers ? If Dr. Reyes had seen hundreds of patients change their minds , he had also doubtless seen the relatives of hundreds of patients change theirs . Was I already changing ? Would I urge Blix again and again . " This is not the time . Wait until your hand knows ? " Until her hand knew nothing ? Neither pain nor the will to end pain ? I put the beer bottles in the garbage pail . I rinsed the glasses . When I went back to Blix she said , " You two had a pretty long talk . " " It was a two-bottle day . For both of us . " " Did you get him to make any promises ? " " I did n't try to . "  |p199For  a minute I thought about telling Blix exactly what Dr. Reyes had said . And exactly what I feared about myself . But I did n't want to disturb her confidence . Her confidence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the time came I would help her . That was probably my best gift to her . " Did n't you talk about it at all ? " " Not in so many words . " " What if they do n't work ? What if I begin to come out of it ? What if Dr. Reyes comes by and tries to rescue me ? " " You wo n't . He wo n't . " " What if I do ? " " I 've got a plan . " It was a plan I had gone over step by step . Its dangers were so real to me that I could n't breathe very well when I thought of them . Speaking of it made my heart race . Since Blix was worrying , I thought I should tell her . " If you showed the least signs of coming out of it , I would pick you up and carry you out to the car . " " Could you do that ? " " I could drag you , if I had to . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's daylight ? " " That wo n't matter . I could see a car coming from either direction . The wall hides the carport from the neighbors . But it will probably be night , or toward morning of the first night . " Blix , understanding what I had in mind , said , " They could hear the car running next door . " " All they 'll hear is the car driving out . If they hear anything . " " Where will we go ? " " On the road to Snow Peak there are a lot of unpaved roads off to the left . You 've seen them . One goes about two miles into a wash . Somebody tried to sink a well there once . That 's where we 'll go . " " There might be some parkers there . " " We 'd be some more parkers . Or go on to another road I know . When we get to the right place , I 'll connect the hose to the exhaust . " " Where 'll you get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's in a gunny sack in the garage right now . It fits exactly . When it 's connected I 'll go over and sit on a sand dune and smoke . " " What if somebody comes ? " " What for ? Nobody but parkers will be out at night . The car will be running to keep it warm . In the daytime I can see any car that turns off the road . " " What if someone wanted to steal the car ? " " No one will get there without a car . What would he want two for ? " " What if he wanted women ? " " I 'd be on the dunes out of sight . And you would n't care . But we 're being romantic . None of this will happen . Finally I 'll drive the car back , leave you in it , the engine running , and go to bed . The neighbors or somebody will discover you . I will have been sleeping since I gave you a shot at one . You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine . Or I can leave you out there at the wash and walk back . I do n't think any of this will happen . What will happen is that you 'll go to sleep here in this bed and not wake up . " That night we both woke up at one-thirty , the wind slamming itself around the corners of the house and blowing the sand against the windows . The wind probably awakened us . " Your next shot is n't due for an hour , " I told Blix . " I 'm all right , " she said . " I can wait . " I hunched the pillows up under my neck . I would n't go to sleep again before two-thirty . I kept quiet , because the time for talk was after the shot and the food and the cigarette  --  as we were drifting back to sleep . I did n't hunt for sleep now , or expectit ; only for what was tranquilizing . Mother once told me ( trying , by hearing the report , to understand it herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that house was not herp201parents ' home but her grandparents ' . She wondered at this . Had n't she been happy as a girl at home ? Why did she want to return to her grandparents ' spring and well ? To their books and window seats ? Why , in memory , was the water sweeter there ? And the view broader and the books wiser ? In actuality , it was not so . My problem was similar , though even less understandable . I knew why I wanted in the nighttime to go back to houses and landscapes . It quieted my mind to see objects and not to hear sentences . I wanted to put all words out of my mind , and substitute for them , images . I wanted to stop thinking about ; and to do . Or be . The difference ( inside our heads ) between age and youth is this : when young , we daydream . Words do not then separate us from experience . We move in our thinking among people and objects , acting . We may speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about others . We think like poets when we 're young . Again , our night minds are no longer able to take us on these wordless tours , into these wordless encounters . With words we recall what has passed . The shape of tomorrow is sentences . I had a ritual which released me from this rat-a-tat-tat of syllables . A ritual which aped youth 's daydreaming ; a ritual which was wordless . I approached a house where once I had lived . I got out of the car . I gathered up an armload of wood on my way in . I started a fire in the kitchen range . My hand reached for the forgotten lever that sifted ashes down into the ash box ; for the key that adjusted the draft in the stovepipe . Step by step , door by door , cupboard by cupboard I made my way through a house I had not been in for over twenty-five years . Nothing was called by name . I returned to my senses . I smelled , touched , saw . My remembering mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men , wooing sleep , count sheep . I wanted nothing so wordy and rational as numbers . I became a sheep ; I moved silent , not simply unspeaking , but without a word in my mind . Somewhere in the midst of this ritual of return , I always fell asleep . So I knew why I made these tours . What I did n't know was why I made them there . There , in that house where I had been unhappy , silly , stupid , sick , overworked . The house where Ever/ett and I had parted . Parted ? Well , yes . Though I was parted from Everett in the way that dust is parted from a broom . I was pushed out . Not even gathered up on a dustpan . Thrown to the wind . So why there ? Like a fish to sweet waters ? To that ugly house of misunderstanding and falseness and pain . The wordless hour of starting fires , serving meals , picking flowers , there ? I do n't know . Since the purpose of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the midst of them , ask " Why ? " And even now , when I 've used words to set forth the experience and am capable of analyses , I do n't know why . There were never any people in that house when I returned to it . I did not go back to be with persons . I went back to solitude ; to rooms and the furnishings of rooms , to certain enjoyable motionswith brooms , spoons , stove pokers , mops , dishtowels . The telephone never rang . A car never pulled up in the driveway . I inhabited a cave before the dawn of language . I was there the night Blix and I were awakened by the winddrivensand against the windows of Blix 's bedroom . I was not seeking or expecting sleep that night . Blix knew I was n't asleep because of the way I was lying half propped up against the headboard . Nevertheless , just in case I had dozed off she spoke in a voice so low that for a second I thought my resolve to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think I married Milt ? " " Blix ? " " I 'm all right . I was thinking about me and Milt . Why did I marry him ? " She would never have asked me " Why do you think you marriedEverett ? Or why did you marry Pete ? " That was my business . But her marriage was her business and she could ask me to speculateabout it if she wanted to . It was n't a dangerous question either . In the first place , I did n't know why she had married him . In the second , when had either of us ever wittingly told the other a truth that hurt ? Not that we lied . To answer her question I had to use words . But I did n't have to leave that ugly ranch house in Brenner . It was there in thep203summer of partings and failures , of infatuations and marriages that Blix had been wooed and had made her decision . Sand on the windows ; Seconal in the veins ; the purr of the electric clock ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about were ourselves . Or had been . They had done these things , said these words . It was tantalizing not to know why . And to remember that even at the time of the happening , we did n't know why . " You always have said , " I told Blix , in my drug-rough voice , " that you married Milt because of his money . " " I said it partly to tease him . Because it was such a good joke on me . The minute I married him , he did n't have any . Do you think I hurt him by saying that ? " I think he thought it was cute . " " The way , if he 'd married me for my beauty and I 'd got smallpox , it would 've been cute for him to say , I married her for her beauty ' ? " " He got back the money . " " But did I marry him for it ? " " He had more than money . His looks . . . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and eyebrows thick as mustaches . And hair billowing out of his shirt . It whetted your curiosity . " " And a widower . " " That whetted your curiosity , too , did n't it ? He had won one woman . Been a bridegroom . Had a wedding night . Stood by an open grave . He was a man of experience . He was n't going to tremble at the touch of your hand just because it was female . If he trembled , it was because it was your hand . Is n't that true ? " Blix said , " I could make Vurl tremble . He was n't a green schoolboy . " " Anyone could make Vurl tremble . He was as impersonal as a dowsing rod . Milt was never a woman chaser . And there was another thing you liked about him . I remember the first time I noticed it . We were at his house and you got a glass of water fromp204the water cooler , drank half of it , and poured the rest back into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , That water costs money . Try not to take out more than you need . ' " " I remember that . I 've never forgotten . " " Why ? " I asked . " It was so bold . " " Bold ? " " Like saying , Where 's the toilet ? ' instead of Where 's the bathroom ? ' It was sexy . " Blix declared . " Sexy ? " " He mentioned the unmentionable . It was exciting . You know how we were at home . The less we had of anything , the more Mama would urge , Have another helping . ' Milt would have said , ' Go slow on that . That 's all there is . ' I thought it was sophisticated . I could n't get used to bragging about how little something cost . Or saying , ' I 'm overdrawn . ' Or That 's too rich for my blood . ' We were poor and tried to hide it . Milt was rich and tried to hide it . " " He succeeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that hot summer of wooings and partings Milt came to dinner , carrying a pound bag of Morton 's salt . " I 've got something wrong with a wisdom tooth , " he said to me . " I 've got to keep it warm . Will you heat this for me ? " He handed me the bag , and I put it in the oven with the biscuitsand served it to him , piping hot , along with the fried chicken and mashed potatoes . He held the bag to his jaw with one hand , and ate with the other . Everett , Blackie , and I watched in astonishment . We would all have died rather than have gone courting , salt bag clapped to jaw . Blix watched in admiration . Why ? Why ? The experience of honesty in a false world ? Honesty , particularly when you 're unaccustomed to it , has a strange , bittersweetflavor . Intoxicating . How much of it can I take ? You see what 's been invisible before . How much more do I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joy , saintliness , sacrifice ? Bestiality , cruelty , bigotry ? There 's an endless variety  --  all real as rain . Butp205what 's so appealing about watchfulness with water ? Home-heated salt bags instead of store-bought oil of cloves ? Has n't honesty more endearing revelations ? What responds ? Masochism ? " You take and I give " ? Or does something fit ? Is there correspondence ? " We take together . " Did something fit ? I did n't know . Perhaps I did n't want to know . I did n't intend to add that question 's answer to the cold nighttime scrape of sand across the thin membranes of our listeningears . I made the roll of the pillows against the back of my neck harder and smaller . I lay in the unsleeping clarity of a Seconal aftermath , in quiet and even pleasure , contemplating unanswerable questions , enduring conflicting emotions : sorrow and felicity , ignorance and insight . The wind bloweth where it listeth . Did something fit ? In every marriage needs are answered . And if the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomesmore complex , the answer , which in the beginning was so satisfying , may become more and more partial . In the beginning , all Everett needed to be was young , male , and able to read and write . I asked for nothing more ; and I 'm not at all sure that in a pinch I would n't have overlooked the last two requirements . Poor Everett did n't have a chance . I was powerful as a python . I led him on with a serpent 's skill to kisses in rainstorms under honeysuckle bowers . I elicited irrevocable answers to loaded questions : " There 's one thing you 've never told me . " " I love you . " " Shall we wait until I 've graduated to be married ? " " I think we 'd better . " Everett could no more resist saying , " I love you ; marry me , " than the piano string , struck by the hammer , could resist its built-in response . I did n't know enough then to know that the response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge that I had the power to elicit it . Poor Everett . Poor Milt . Everett said , " I love you . " Milt said ,  | " Watch the water . " Both were gone geese with these words . Blix and I , too , I suppose . Though I escaped . Escaped ? Escape and expulsion are two different matters . I was expelled by an act , though neither performed nor accepted as such , more loving than any Cure. 6My autumnal visit with Blix began with a telephone call of mine to her . A year after her operation she had gone to the clinic in Los Angeles for further tests . I had put off the call , out of fear , until the day after her return . Blix answered the phone . Blix 's voice had always been a chord , a subtle mingling of notes . She was dappled , eyes flecked , hair tawny ; and she was dapple-voiced , light and dark alternating . There was no need for words when I called her . Her voice told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncertain in their relationship to each other : a handful of arrows shattered , but bound together . " I 'll write you , " she said . I do n't know what I said . Perhaps " Tell me now . " She said , " There 's been a recurrence , inoperable , a matter of time . " The arrowy voice , with its twang of bow cord and reminders of feathered flight , held together firmly enough to say those words . " Shall I come ? " " It ca n't be too soon . " The whole of our living is a war we are going to lose . But in a long sickness , battles are sometimes won . Then , not only is relief felt , but joy , power , even invincibility . Cowards may die many deaths , but the doomed experience many resurrections . The night of the wind-blown sand , the night Dr. Reyes had set me to wondering whether it might be my resolution , notp207Blix 's , that would fail , Blix experienced one of these resurrections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . She had waited the full time for her shot  --  and a little more . I was out of bed while the click of her light was still in my ears . " Blix ? " " I 'm all right . But the damned thing 's acting up . " She had a good many names for the " damned thing . " Inside her , at the base of her spine , it was invisible . But she saw it clearly : shapeless , though far from bodiless ; something like a science-fiction blob . If it had been a science-fiction blob , a Satan bug from outer space whose function it was to attack humans , she could have endured it better . But this was a Satan bug from inner space , her very self , her own dear body , by means of which all she had experienced had come to her . Once , she asked me , " What if one of your hands kept trying to strangle you ? And could n't be cut off . And you knew that sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your own body , turned against you . Would n't you hate it ? That 's the way I feel about the damned thing . " " Have you waited too long for the shot ? " Blix did n't answer . I think she was afraid that if she opened her mouth a moan might escape . By this time I could give shots as well as Dr. Reyes . As I pinched together the flesh of her upper arm , the power of the nurse came over me : I was the technician , the comfort-bringer , the one depended upon . The shot , as always , was followed by a variety of pills . That night they proved very strong medicine . Or else the damned thing was unusually weak . I could see the pain leave Blix . It crept back inside its parent . The damned thing did n't die because of this invasion , but it was knocked out . It had no strength for attack . All it could do was maintain itself . The furrow between Blix 's eyes became shallower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was happening . She did n't want her luck to be noticed , and maybe spoiled , by fate . All she said was , " I 'm hungry . "  |p208I  named the usual nighttime treats . " Coffee ice cream . And a glass of hot malted milk , " Blix decided . " A miserable combination . Narsty . " " It 's what I want . " Blix was back , and herself again . She knew what she wanted and said so . When I returned with the food , she was out of bed in bra and panties . Blix had never fought her sickness , never tried to live " as if " : a woman doomed , but dining out ; driving her T-bird ; dancing with tears in her eyes . She did n't wait for things to be snatched from her . She said her good-bys with dignity , made her bedroom her world , bedclothes her costume . " What are you doing ? " I asked . " Dressing , " Blix answered calmly . " Hand me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put down the food and found what she wanted . She stood , before dressing , looking at herself in the full-length mirror . " Stork , stork , " she hissed , and turned quickly away . She had n't lost much weight , but there had been a shifting of weight , so that her trunk appeared heavier than it should . She dressed very carefully , sat at her dressing table to give full attention to make-up and hair . Sara , a week or two earlier , had asked me , " Do you know what Blix would like ? " " No , " I told her . " She would like , she says , to have had her hair done , be made-up , perfumed , and in her best dress when they find her . " " It 's her idea , for Milt 's sake , that no one know she did n't die of natural causes . If she wants that , she 'd better be in her bedroom in her nightgown . " " Oh , she knows that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , Tassie would talk me out of it , if I told her . ' " " I wo n't talk her out of it if she 's changed her mind about Leading Citizen 's Wife a Suicide ' hurting Milt . And Papa . That 's the only argument against it . "  | " She 's got the idea you think dressing up like that would be silly . " " I 'm just slovenly , living or dying . If Blix wants a well-dressed exit , it 's her exit . I 'll help her . She can wear anything she wants to . " " She does n't really want to  --  under the circumstances , " Sara said . " But if she had only herself to think of , that 's what she 'd do . " The pink Capris had stovepipe legs . The sweater was a light but bulky mohair , embroidered with a spattering of white daisies . Blix put on white sandals and picked up a matching white clutch . " What are you going to do , Blix ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered me . " I 'm going outside , " she said . " I 'm going for a short walk . Then I 'm coming back . And when I come back I want you to let me in . " " The door is n't locked . " " I do n't mean , let me in . ' I mean , invite me in . Welcome me . " Invite ? Welcome ? It was her house . What was she doing ? Practicing ghosting ? " I want to come back like a stranger , " Blix said . " Or try to . I want to see the house for the first time , once again . " Bulky sweaters and Capris make storks of everyone . Blix was a fashionable figure when she went out into her Japanese garden . I slid the door open for her . The garden was protected on three sides by walls and on the fourth by a fence . Even so , the wind eddied there , cold and dry . A dusty buffeting night . Nearer day than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everything perfectlyvisible in spite of that . Big stars , hard and glaring like automobile headlights , a lopsided , bleached moon , white sand . Blix walked through the garden without pause until she was opposite Milt 's bedroom . She stopped there . Was she listening to him breathe ? Did she think about awakening him ? Saying , " Let 's take a walk in the wind , Milt " ? If so , she decided against it . She opened the garden door and passed from my sight into the car/port which connected house and garage . I went into the living room , where , through the glass wall , I could see the street in both directions . Blix crossed the street . She did so , I think , in order to have a stranger 's view of her own house . The sleeping pill I had taken- when I brought Blix her food ( I wanted to be sleepy when she finished eating ) gave me the sensation of being two persons : a sleeper who , though sleeping , lived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of the house were built for wind : their lacy leaves were unresisting ; their short gnarled trunks anchored them strongly . The hedge of denser oleanders , taking the wind broadside , heeled over like a boat . The wind was an old story to the palms . Their dry clatter was almost as old as its blowing . Down on the floor of the valley the ribbon of dust and sand had become a river . Blix turned away from her own home to look at that river of sand . She knew it well . She had swept it from her floors , brushed it from her window sills , eaten it with her food . She leaned into the wind as she walked . If it had stopped suddenly , she would have fallen forward . She went down the street as far as a house brightly lighted , at four in the morning . There , turned toward the house , arms folded against her chest , she paused . What did she see ? Sickness ? Quarreling ? Drinking ? Preparation for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched . Whatever it was , sorrowful or ugly , it was life . It was what she was losing . Did she think , This will be my last look into the story of someone else 's lighted room ? She started to leave , then turned back . Perhaps it is easier to give up your own life than someone else 's . Finally , the wind at her back now , and hurrying her , she began her homeward walk . She came slowly in spite of the wind , determined to take her time . She lifted her head , gazing at what I could n't see , the somber wall of mountains behind the house . The drug , the wind , the unexpectedness of Blix 's leaving the house confused me . Were we both ghosts ? Was this a visit , inp211afterlife , to a former habitation ? Was this the past , repeated ? Poor towheaded tyke , walking , walking in the gusts of a longpastSanta Ana ? Would I go to a piano and once again play the " Barcarolle , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and helpful ? " Was this Mrs. Kilgrew 's faith put to some final test ? " Disease is error . " Had Blix sent down a ray from her believing mind , lethal to the damned thing ? Was she free now of her bed ? Could she pick it up and walk ? She looked toward her own home . I left the window . I did n't want to be a spying hostess . The sage greens and Chinese reds in the living room made the statements planned for them by the decorator . A picture was revealed . I was n't sure its name was home . It was as deliberate as " Whistler 's Mother . " It was a place for the eyes . It took for granted that living is mostly looking . I moved , light-bodied , Seconal-alienated , away from the front of the house . I turned my back on the road down which Blix was walking . I faced the Japanese garden , where nature , treated like furniture , composed another and weatherproof picture . Above the garden were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed . In a temporary house I stood between mountain and desert , reflecting on the shortness of time before I , too , would be part of the burden of dust blown by that timeless wind . Blix did n't , as I had half expected , ring the doorbell I heard the door open , and after a little I turned to face it . Blix had her minute in which to catch the room unawares , to see a strange room with a stranger 's eyes . But this was play-acting and slightly pompous , not a role Blix could maintain for long . She closed the door behind her and smiled at me . " Where 's the ice cream ? " " Melted , of course . " I thought that she , who never shed a tear because of pain , might cry now for lack of what she 'd counted on . " There 's more , " I told her . " Lots more . A half-gallon . We can eat all night . " " Will you eat , too ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a usual night . " I do n't intend just to watch you . " She had cried once . From pain , I thought . In the kitchen , stirring the powdered coffee into ice cream , I remembered what Blix had told me on the evening I had persuaded her that her hand would know when the time came to reach for that plastic container . She had cried the afternoon before . Some fierce pang , unaffectedby shots or pills , had gripped her . She had gotten out of bed and folded herself , crying , into the position , knees and cheek to floor , that newborn babies , remembering a lost ease , take when sleeping . She had stayed there , without ease , unsleeping , silently crying . When she did get up , a tear-damp spot , large as a puppy 's wetting , was left to gray the white carpet . The next day , persuaded that her hand would be knowledgeable , she said , " Tassie , do you know why I cried yesterday after-noon ? " " Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hurting , but that was n't why I cried . I cried because I was happy . I was glad to feel the pain get fierce . It would help me to want to do what I had to do . I did n't know about trusting my hand then . I thought I 'd have to be given a shove  --  and this was the shove I needed . The pain did n't make me cry . The happiness did . I thanked God for the pain . " Blix was still in the living room when I came back from the kitchen with the food . She surprised me by saying , " Let 's eat in here . I put the tray on the coffee table . The ice cream was good , strong , and bittersweet . " Blix , " I asked , " do you remember the funny ice-cream fad you brought to Brenner the summer you stayed with me and Everett ? " " Ice-cream fad ? I remember a lot about Brenner that summer , but if there was a funny ice-cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been anything funny about it at the time . Not to us involved in it , anyway . Something ludicrous , yes . But that only added to the misery . To know that what you 're doing is ludicrous , to hate being ludicrous , but unable to stop . Talking to Blix all those years later , the whole summer was funny , too sad for tears . The ice-cream episode , funny as a crutch . Exactly that funny . A story of accidents and cripplings . Some of the story , which started with melon a la mode , Blix had never heard before . I told her partly to make her laugh . Partly , since she was short-changed on future , to give her more past . " Do n't you remember , " I asked her , " that you took cleaned cantaloupes to the Tahquitz Confectionery that summer and had ice cream put in them ? " " No . I think you 're making it up . " " How could I make up anything like that ? " " What I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember is Manuel . But your cantaloupe caper was what gave me a chance to be with him . So I remember the cantaloupes , too . "  |p214This  was the first time I had ever stepped out of my role of elder sister to Blix . Admitted I was no example . Mentioned the name of a man not my husband . Mentioned Manuel 's name . A kind of sick emptiness filled me as I did so . I was saying good-by to a part I had played for so long that without it I did n't know who I was . No . I knew who I was . But I did n't know how , publicly , to be the person I was . Face to face , I knew my own self . But I had never let Blix face me . The craze that Blix introduced to Brenner that summer was a mild one , well suited to a Pilgrim campus , where it had started . There the college kids had taken cleaned cantaloupe halves to the local ice-cream parlor and enjoyed cantaloupe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patch of small but flavorsome melons out beyond the chicken houses . Blix cleaned a half a dozen of these one morning , kept them in the cooler all day , and when Milt came over that evening proposed a trip to town to get them filled . Milt was n't able that summer to deny Blix anything , not even her request that Blackie and I go along . " Can Manuel come , too ? " Blackie asked . " Who 's Manuel ? " Milt wanted to know . " Everett 's sulphur foreman . " " A Mexican ? " " Sure . " " He wo n't want to go then , " Milt said . But he did . And Milt , with his twosome already ruined , did n't really care how many more crowded into the back seat of his Packard . Blix was up front with him . Blackie , Manuel , and I and the twelve melon halves were in back . I sat in the middle between Blackie and Manuel . I did n't have to talk . Blackie took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shoulder to knee to ankle , there was no possible way I could avoid touching Manuel . Fate does n't often make you gifts like that . The trip to town was over in a minute , of course , and the melon eating did n't take much longer.  |p215Manuel  paid . Milt would have , except that he saw that to do so would hurt Manuel 's pride . Besides , leaving Manuel tied up with change-making , and Blackie eating his last half-melon to the rind , and me waiting for the two of them , gave him the opportunity he wanted . When Manuel , Blackie , and I stepped outside the confectionery the Packard was gone . Milt had n't abandoned us to much of a hardship . Home was a mile and a half down a black-topped road lined with walnut and apricot orchards . The orchards were full of campers . The supper campfires were out but the sweet smell of the evening wood smoke was still in the air , mixed with the sharp brandy ferment of overripe and rotting apricots . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a rainy sound . There is no good way for two people to touch , when walking , without being linked , without a matching of rhythms . Attempts to touch without linking , turn out to be nothing but bumps . The intent may be love , but the body , walking , is a mechanism ; and the touch of another unsynchronized mechanism is nothing but unlove to it . Manuel knew this . He offered me his arm . He did n't know how to do so ; or I to accept , for that matter . He did n't even know what to call me . Mrs. Henshaw . Tasmania . Tassie . Blackie 's sister . He never once in my life spoke my name . In his life , maybe , but never in my hearing . We walked in silence . Our footsteps , we being light-footed , made soft light sounds on the asphalt , muffled like the sound of fruit falling onto plowed ground . We made our own music , and we kept time to it . I was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stride ; perhaps he shortened his a little for my accommodation . Unlinked , when we reached home , the harmony of reciprocal action ceased . We becamewhat we were . Brother , sister , Mexican fruit worker . Blackie was too sleepy to provide us the bond of boxing . We parted quickly . Everett was sleeping soundly . I went to the window withoutp216thought , following a habit of star-gazing before sleep . Below me was Manuel . There was no mistaking him , in the wash of pale starlight . He sat on the stump of an umbrella tree which had been cut down because its roots were robbing the first rows of the orchard . He looked up . I looked down . There was no throwing of kisses , no waving , no whispered word . I knew he saw me . There was a movement in the long-torsoed upper half of his body : no more than a deep breath , possibly . I leaned my elbows on the window sill and gazed down . Manuel gazed upward . So we spent the night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of it . Till daylight . " " Were n't you dead next day ? " " Too tired to move . But what do you expect after a night of love ? " " I expect more in the night . " I said nothing . " And I was right there , down the hall from you that whole night ? " " So far as I know , you were . I was n't giving much thought to you that night . " " Or me to you . " After a little she added , " It would really have been better for me to have been the older sister , would n't it ? You needed more advice than I did . " " Maybe being the oldest would have made you me . " " I do n't think so . But it would have been better . I would have been authorized to help you , then . " " I 'll tell you something you did that summer to help me . Do you remember the dance Everett had for the Mexicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to care less and less about trying to keep the cost of operation down . He was going to go bust anyway . Why not go bust with a bang ? He had always been freehanded with his help . He had already bought a couple of truckloads of watermelons for his cutters.  |p217When  things got worse , he bought another truckload and planned a dance as well . The dance did n't cost anything  --  the Mexicans provided their own music  --  except a broken-down crew of workers the next day . The tables and benches were moved out of the cutting sheds . The earth , by now a smooth cement-like mixture of dirt , Nehi , and squashed apricots , formed a fine dance floor . The music was Mexican , that peculiar blend of whine , fire , and sweetness . Occasionally , the musicians played old American hits : " I 'm Sitting on Top of the World , " " Show Me the Way to Go Home , " " Baby Face . " Everett did n't dance . Milt , who was running a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could n't dance  --  except solos . But Blix danced with everyone who had the nerve to ask her  --  but most often with Manuel . Manuel turned out to be an extraordinary dancer . Blix seldom had partners her equal . That night she had one . She was wearing a white silk pleated skirt , a white silk hiplengthblouse , and a long fluttering blue-and-green , sea-colored scarf . Her skirt opened up like a ballerina 's . Her scarf stood out as straight as metal . In any other crowd the dancers would have stopped to watch them . The Mexicans wanted to dance , not watch . I still think Blix and Manuel were the best " ballroom " dancers I 've ever seen . I still think this , though I now know what I saw in Blix dancing : I saw my own unexpressed femininity and grace , my own invisible fire and beauty , given expression . I even believed that Manuel knew this : that he did n't think of himself as dancing with a beautiful and gifted dancer , but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did n't feel a second 's envy or jealousy . Just pride , pride , pride . And joy . Blix expressing with Manuel that part of me which was undeveloped . Or suppressed . " What was the dance they were all dancing that summer at Brenner ? " I asked Blix . " I do n't remember . " " You were dancing me , that night . I know that , anyway . "  |p218The  melons a la mode , the dance , Blix remembered . The peachpitnecklace , like the all-night tryst , was news to her . It was a summer of courtly love for me and Manuel : nothing but gifts , symbols , and gestures . The lady 's honor untouched . The knight 's fidelity proved . It was put together out of uncourtly materials : instead of tournaments , evenings talking of boxing in the Pico Arena . Instead of candlelit meetings in chapel or high hall , vigils on stumps and bedroom chairs . Instead of songs and ballads , dancing in the cutting shed . Instead of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Holy Land , a necklace made of carved peach pits . How he did it , I do n't know . Everett burned the necklace before I had a chance really to look at it . I 'd seen baskets carved from peach pits before , one half the pit forming the basket , the other half cut away to make the handle . But that was the first and last necklace I have ever seen , handle looped through handle to form a chain of rosy whorls and wrinkled openings . Hours of cutting and gluing had gone into it . The apricot season is only six weeks long . Any six weeks , unless you are sick or waiting for a letter that does n't come , is short . Six weeks of love unexpressed is shortest of all . Short as the fall of a leaf from a tree in still weather . The last chance is gone . The pain of the word , turning in you , that wanted to come out is stronger than ever . The eyes ache from trying to carry messages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is the puzzle , too . The mystery . Unrequited love can be dealt with . " He does n't love me . " You do n't blame yourself for that . You bear it . You did your part . But love neither expressed nor denied , possibly imagined ? Nothing resolved there . A lifetime can be spent imagining might-have-beens . Whatever my state , the apricots had blossomed , set , ripened , been picked , cut , and dried . There were no might-have-beens for them . The season was over . Many of the apricot leaves were al/ready yellow and on their way to orange . When a breeze stirred , they fell , turning as they went to earth like coins caught in a current of water . The Mexicans were packing their trucks , collecting their kids , getting their gear together . Heading home , or to the northern peach orchards . It was finished for them . What they had come to do they had accomplished . Everett was finished . The bottom out of the market and droppinglower . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , give up the ranch , pay what he could , and hope for the best . Blix was engaged . No ring , because she would n't have the diamondthat had belonged to Milt 's first wife , though Milt said , " The stone does n't know the difference . " Blix took it , but she would n't wear it . " I 'll sell it someday , " she said . " It wo n't know the difference about that , either . " This did n't sound very romantic to me . But that summer I had become less oracular about love and romance . The Sanchezes loaded up on Saturday night , and Blix was n't around to be my stand-in for a ritual farewell . Blackie had gone to the movies . If I wanted to say good-by , I 'd have to say it all on my own and without help . I wanted to say good-by too much to go out there in the finished orchard and pretend that Josephina was the object of my farewells . Not that I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I missed the feel and taste of her brown soft warmth , missed it too much to let it be , as I had when summer began , a means for something else . Sunday morning was Sunday bright . Still and quiet . The air , though there would be plenty of days of 11o  --  heat before theOctober rains , had already turned the corner toward fall . Thesad clear air of a season ending . Blue sky , a million miles overhead ; brown earth , for the minute dry and dead as ashes . Inbetween , the living was hushed . Half the Mexicans were gone . There would be no more singing in the morning , no more birdjabberfrom the children as they awakened talking . No moreevenings of wood smoke and guitar music . The electric lightsp220would burn no longer at night in the cutting shed . The season was over , the debts were incurred , the winter was coming . On Sunday morning I went downstairs so that I could see the Sanchez truck as it passed the front of the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it pull out of the orchard and I could n't help smiling when it came into sight . It wobbled with its weight . Stove , tent , bedding , the Sanchez kids , a goat . All except the kids and the goat lashed on in a lumpy mountain . The kids sat on the lumps . Manuel , his mother , and Josephina sat in the cab . In front of the house Manuel stopped the truck , got out , and came up the walk . I could not believe what I saw , because it was what I wanted . If I had seen him thumb his nose at me or throw a rotten apricot at the house or drive past without a look , that I would have believed . What I could n't believe in was my luck  --  and I was having some . I thought about running . Not toward Manuel , but away from him . Stop while I was ahead . Dreams go by contraries , do n't they ? Dream of a wedding and go to a funeral ? This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right on up the walk and into the house as if he 'd never heard of the law of contraries . If I said a word the whole time he was there , I ca n't remember it . He was holding the peach-pit chain in his hands , though until he reached me , I did n't know what it was . When he reached me , he said , " I 've come to say good-by and to give you something I made for you . " Then he held up the necklace of carved peach pits , and I inclinedmy head and he hung the chain around my neck . It was lighter than it looked and rougher . I remember thinking , as it settled into place , My neck will bear the marks of this . It hung halfway to my waist . I lifted it with one hand and was dazed , knowing the hours of tedious work that had gone into it . By him for me , while I had dreamed and wondered and given Josephina baths . Then , more to separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else ( I think ) , Manuel went down on one knee . I might know about courtly love . He did n't . He was n't pay/ing fealty or taking any oath of allegiance . He was doing something ; he had to do something , and was trying to keep what he did within bounds . I also had to do something . I bent my cheek to his hair , heavy and silky , smelling of smoke and apricots and Lucky Tiger . It was in this ridiculous posture that Everett found us . Or found us actually coming out of it , for I had heard his footsteps approaching . Perhaps the coming out looked worse than the original posture , suggesting , as it might , a kissing and clasping that had never happened . Manuel , on his feet by the time Everett reached us , simply held out his hand , which Everett took , shook it , thanked Everett , and said he hoped to see him again next year at apricot season . Then he went calmly back to his truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouted " Adios . " I waved and shouted " Adios . " Then there was a great silence and a great emptiness . Finally Everett lifted up the necklace . " What 's this ? " he asked . " Peach pits , " I told him . " Carved peach pits . " " He carve them ? " he asked , nodding in the direction the Sancheztruck was traveling . " Yes . " " Well , you do n't want that , " he said , and gave the necklace a jerk . It did n't break easily . I could have lifted them off . I could have said , " No , it 's mine . Let it alone . " Instead , I stiffened my neck . Everett jerked , and the chain parted . He threw it into the fireplace , into a fire laid , though it was summer , for appearance 's sake . Then he lit the fire . That was my big chance . Stick my hand in the flames and rescue what I valued . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had rolled unnoticed by him under the library table . I told myself that numbers did n't count . One basket could speak of love as truly as twenty . After Everett left I rescued it and put it in a box I kept for treasures.  |p222Next  day Everett suggested that we go to the beach on a camping trip . The beach was near . It was cool . In another week we 'd be cleaned out , so we had nothing much to lose in the way of money . The ten or twenty dollars we 'd spend on the trip would n't be a drop in the bucket of our debts . I told Everett I 'd go . I was n't crazy about camping trips . A camping trip for Everett , maybe for all men , represents man 's conquest of nature worked out on a personal scale . Everett had n't licked nature as a rancher . Nature had licked him . He had n't licked nature as a husband . He had n't even discovered it . His wife was receiving peach-pit gifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left for him to try his mettle on . So he proposed camping . We were lucky , in mid-August , to find a secluded camping spot . We waited to move in while another family moved out . The beginnings of a cave had been carved out of a natural indentation in the sandy overhang of a ten-foot bluff on the far side of Balboa Bay . It was nothing but an eyebrow really , but that wall at my back was all I needed to feel at home . Blix and I hadp223played house in spots like that back in Linda ; rooms outlined by pebbles , flower petals on the table for food , and grasshoppers and stinkbugs corraled in stone stables for livestock . Everett , in camping out , became an imitation pioneer . I became an imitation little girl . The quilts we brought with us made a pretend bed , the grill a pretend stove , and canteen a pretend water faucet . I outlined the magazines and books with shells to make a pretend library table . Our pretend front porch was the bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was water of varying color and unceasing movement . Even in the early morning , when a lid of white coveredit , there were those tremors beneath the lid which in the eye of a sleeper betray dreams . At night the sand under our Kentucky comforters shook with the impact of the big free-running breakers , pounding against the ocean beach a quarter of a mile away . They growled , with the same sound I had heard in Linda of oil wells coming in . Both sounds frightened me . If camping was what you wanted , or the sea , we had no reason to complain . There was no fog . The sun came up uncovered . The alternations of hot sun prickle and cool salt spray awakened us , so that we felt that we had been only half-alive back in the unvarying heat of Brenner . The cooking , though not the posture  --  bent over a grill on two stones  --  was easy . There was not much to cook : eggs , bacon , beans , potatoes . Gulls made our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piled up like castles ; and the sun , going down , first gilded them , then dyed them the purple and black of overripe plums and figs . Happiness , if camping could give it to you , was there . It was n't there for Everett . He still believed in the effectiveness of what he called the Cure for me ; but it was plainly not proving effective for him . The Cure was , actually , during that week , of more satisfaction to me than to Everett . It was still something for my stoicism to endure . Everett enjoyed camping because , through it , he conquered nature . But nature in our sand cave , potatoes boiling on the grill , and Scattergood Baines on the library table did n't take much enduring . The Cure , however , took as muchp224endurance as ever ; and there was satisfaction in the possession of a technique of being elsewhere . Pitiful way to live ; but human beings must feel something : ecstasy or fury . I chose to feel pride , a rigid deadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretiveness , in irony . Pride was perhaps what Everett wanted , too . Something or someone to conquer . But the camping was too easy and the woman was too complacent ; and the memory of the summer failure too raw to be erased by small successes . Everett was trying to find a substitute foe when he suggested that we rent a rowboat , and let the money it cost be hanged . I agreed with him . I felt sorry for Everett . He had worked like a dog all summer , and the winter that lay ahead of him was one of more work  --  with debts added to the burden . A boat for a week cost only $1.50 . If he thought rowing would help , I would row with him . It did help . It helped us both . We set off across the bay in midafternoon . The water resisted us , and the wind , blowing inland , pushed curling whitecaps against our blunt-nosed boat . We worked at it together , sweating and pulling . The boat , our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean side of the bay . Car and cave became smaller and smaller . Bed and stove , library table and store of groceries disappeared completelyfrom sight . We beached the boat on the strip of sand that separated bay from sea . The town was built at the far end of the bay , on the ocean side . We walked along the glistening surf-packed sand into town . After three days of nothing but our own closed faces , a town , particularly a vacation town , was a miracle . We had forgotten that people lived like this . We had forgotten people . We had forgotten ( I had forgotten ) living as pleasure and not as symbol . Where a kiss was a kiss and not a Cure ; and a Cure was a Cure and not an occasion for pride . We were Adam and Eve come back to an Eden we had never inhabited . Crowds of young people , almost our own age , brown and laughing , strolled the boardwalk , sat on stools at counters , near/naked in their bathing suits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they yelled , screamed , sang , hugged , kissed . They had no pride . They yelled at passers-by . The girls had slave bracelets on their ankles and monkey kisses on their necks . ( I once made a false monkey kiss with ink on my neck . It looked like what it was , Waterman 's Royal Blue , and not a kiss by man or monkey . ) The boys had sweaters tied around their waists . They were glazed with sand . None of them had ever heard of apricots , feed stores , cows , Cures , peach-pit necklaces . Everett and I were n't so much cave dwellers transported to the city as one generation ( our grandparents ) looking at another generation . We spoke the same language as the people around us ; yet if we had sat on a stool next to one of these couples , what could we have said ? We were not even visible . We had erased ourselves , somehow . Not crazy , peculiar , or different . Invisible . If we bumped into somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Coke , would we be served ? We clung together . We were a few years older than these young people . That did n't trouble us . What troubled us was that we were strangers to the world in which they lived . We walked the sea-front street , up and down . We did n't speak a word to anyone or spend a nickel on anything ; and when we got back to our boat we were glad . Rowing was work and opposition , something real and familiar . Our camp , however , looked make-believe . It did n't have even a grasshopper , stinkbug life . Across the bay was something more difficult and exciting ; it might not give pleasure , but it had to be tried . I cooked us a special supper that evening . I fried bacon . In the bacon grease I fried cubed boiled potatoes . Into this mixture I stirred four eggs . It was a marvelous dish . We were hungry from all that rowing and observing . Eating alone provided some of the happiness the Cure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of bottles of Delaware Punch , " Everett said . " This is a real feast . " I felt close to Everett . We had rowed together , made it to ap226strange shore , and been drawn to each other in our estrangement from everyone else . Everett praised my cooking . " Let 's go back again tomorrow , " I urged . Well fed , and with a plan for the next day under our belts along with the bacon , potatoes , and eggs , we went to bed contentedly . The sea rocked us ; our quilts covered us . Everett did n't use the word Cure , and I did n't feel scorn and pride . I thought of the two of us with compassion . Babes in the wood . Quilts instead of leaves . Each the other 's only comfort . A house outlined with shells and pebbles . Built on sand , too , but I did n't think of that . I felt like saying some old-time prayer . " Gentle Jesus , meek and mild . Here I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep before I could pray . We had decided on the proper time to start our trip next day and we made ourselves wait until that hour came . We wanted to start earlier . The visit to town had become in our minds halfpartyand half-test . The test was to see if we could become one of those singing , eating , kissing young people . If we passed that test then the party began . We wanted ( or I did ) to dress like the boardwalk crowd . All we could do was to put on the best we had in our suitcase . Everett'sbest was ice-cream pants , black-and-white suede shoes , and a **27;7160;TOOLONG regimental tie . He wore his suit coat with the pants . I thought he had a resort look . A front-porch look was the best I could manage . Another trousseau dress , lettuce green voile with a six-inch moss green belt of satin at the waist . It should have been at the hipbones . Or , better still , nonexistent . White buck shoes . A matronly purse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We tried to calm ourselves down on the way over . Going out to dinner and a movie ? What kind of a feat was that ? Thousands of people did so regularly . Thousands of people were mountainp227climbers , opera singers , and pearl divers , too , but their success did n't incline us to climb , sing , or dive . We had gone to the moviesin the four years we had been in Brenner , but we had never once " gone out to dinner . " This was my first trip to any town except Brenner or Linda since my Christmas visit to Los Angeles with Blix . Just remembering that December evening promenade relieved me of some of my qualms . Why had Blix and I been full of swagger there ? What if Blix had been with me now ? Would trial become ad-venture ? " Where 'll we eat ? " Everett asked . Well , there was one difference . Blix always knew where to eat . We looked at menus tacked outside restaurants . The food was expensive and had names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , but Murphy bravado was something , with Everett , I tried to soft-pedal . Everett moved us on from one restaurant to another . The farther we got from the sea the farther we got from seafood . We settled for strawberry waffles in a waffle shop . The Waffle Shoppe was hot , with hundreds of glazed eyes staring at us from the varnished walls of knotty pine . The waffles were pine-colored , but flabby under a watery smear of crushed strawberries and whipped cream that came out of a jar labeled " Fluffo . " Seafare was what I had imagined , and this food was so landlockedI wanted to cry . Where was the taste of iodine ? The wind off the sea and the sandy ones jangling their slave bracelets ? Stroking ukuleles and bodies indiscriminately ? We were lost between two generations , and neither generation wanted to claim us . We were young to the oldsters , old to the youngsters , and pleased nobody , including ourselves . We were homeless . The movie was better . Better for me anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that simultaneously gratified desires and satisfied snobberies . Everyone agreed that Arrowsmith was a great book and Helen Hayes a great actress . That took care of the snobbery department . Ronald Colman was a beautifulp228man , cultured but passionate , fire under control , but barely . He did n't have to be in a great play to be enjoyed . As it turned out , the great moment of the picture was n't his , but Helen Hayes 's . We watched her , unselfish , devoted , misunderstood , pick up , then light , the cigarette onto which we had seen , earlier , Dr. Arrowsmith 's death-dealing serum drop . We cried out to her with every indrawn breath , " Do n't do it . Do n't do it . " She did it anyway . She inhaled deeply . We recognized in her act the chanciness of life . We saw how life hinges on small things and luck takes precedence over design . At the very moment of our happiness the seeds of death are sown . The short time allotted us is shortened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , do n't , " we called to her . " If you do that , you 'll die . " She could n't hear us . She filled her lungs with death . She died . Everyone walked out of the theater saying to himself , " Live while you can . " After " Arrowsmith , " after chance , death , and defiance , how could we get into a boat we had rented for $1.50 a week , and row back to a semicave of counted bacon strips and carefully graduated pebbles ? Where were the chances we should be taking ? The dream we could die for ? Oh , Martin Arrowsmith , where are you ? Oh , Sinclair Lewis , define our problem ! After a movie , a couple should saunter . Everett wanted to saunter . He saw himself as the compelling lover , the man on whose strong arm a clinging woman depended . I did n't want to saunter , I could n't saunter . I wanted to hasten . Fate was at my heels and the time was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My God , I was Hester Prynne , Jane Eyre , Cathy . Where were Heathcliff and Rochester ? Not at my side . Hasten , hasten in their direction . I wanted to please Everett . So I acted the part I knew he wanted : the sauntering woman . Day was over , but it was not quite full night . It was a hovering time of ambivalence , some light , sand-yellow , still in the western sky , but dark enough to show the flash of phosphorescence onp229the lips of the breaking waves . Everett and I had given up all hope of being accepted by those whose skins were bronzed , who sang , who could have worn seaweed without self-consciousness . We were outlanders , hayseeds , and , though the word had n't yet been invented , squares . We had sharp corners . We could n't roll with the crowd . We took a stand . Our dimensions were visible . And the other squares , the middle-aged diners down there in the Waffle Shoppe ? It had been a look into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to see the middleaged . ( The elderly are so remote they are invisible without effort . ) And without such training , who would have the courage to persist into middle age ? When it goes against the grain , sauntering is more difficult than hurrying . But I sauntered . The night was unusual for the beach : warm , no wind . In the way married couples have of reconciling each other to failure , of giving each other reasons for not trying again , Everett and I praised the waffles , the movie , the weather . Everett said he had n't seen a prettier dress than mine . I said I had n't seen a snappier outfit than his . We pitied the people sweating in Barancaand Brenner , while those who had planned better saunteredby the seaside . We sauntered toward our boat , going the long way around , following the curve of the bay . Before we came in sight of the dance pavilion we heard the music of the band . The sound came to us over the water , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conveyed . We had to look up to see the " Balboa Ballroom , " which was built onto a wharf standing high above the gently lapping water on its forty-foot piers . It was a beautiful sight , its beauty doubled by the reflections below . Mirrored in the glassy darkness , the Japanese lanterns rising and falling with the movement of the water appeared to be keeping time to the music . Young ( though we did n't know it ) , a summer night by the sea , the sound of the sea and music mingling in our ears . Wep230heard the beat of the music and saw the dancers respond to it . What was the music ? We did n't know . The dance ? A mystery to us . What was the longing , unsatisfied , in our narrow but growinghearts , which the sea and the music stirred so painfully ? Nameless . But we were bound to satisfy that nameless longing or die . As we came closer we could see the delicately tapping fingers of the horn players , the curved shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bass fiddlers slapping their big wooden women . The piano player roamed up and down the keyboard , lacing all the other sounds together with the in-andoutshuttle of his flowing notes . It was the first dance band we had ever seen . We knew they existed . We had heard them on phonograph records . But we had never seen one . To reach our boat we had to pass under the wharf . The main entrance to the ballroom was above on the street side , but there were stairs leading up to the dance floor from the bay rim where we stood . At the foot of these stairs I stopped . I put my hand on one of the heavy piers that supported the wharf . I closed my eyes and felt , as I had seen Helen Keller do in pictures , the surge and pound of the music . " Feel , " I told Everett . He did n't care to be seen feeling a barnacled pier in plain sight of any passer-by . " Shut your eyes and feel . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hear at the same time . " He took his hand down . " I can hear it . That 's enough . I do n't need to feel it shake a piece of wood . " Shake was n't the word exactly . What sound waves do to the eardrums , the vibrations inside the wood did to the marrow of all my bones . I heard all over . My sauntering resolutions were broken by what I heard . What I had controlled with slow steps and well-chosen words came alive again . " Let 's go , " I urged Everett.  | " Go ? " asked Everett . " We are going . You 're the one who 's slowed us down . Feeling wood . " " Go to the dance , I mean . " " We ca n't dance . " " We 've never tried . " " I have . " " There 're so many people up there . No one would notice us . They 're people up there just walking around in time to the music . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be doing a jig . Or a highland fling , or something . " " Everett , I would n't . I 've got some sense of what 's proper . I want to dance with you . I want us to dance together . I feel like that 's what we came for . " " I do n't . " " We could learn . We 'll never have a better chance . Here in a crowd , where no one knows us . " I went up one step and Everett followed me . I went up another . " I do n't think people are supposed to walk up these stairs . " " What are they here for ? " " Exit . In case of fire . " " There 's a man up at the top taking tickets . I saw him . " " We do n't have any tickets . " " Selling them , I mean . " " We do n't have money to throw around . " " A dollar . A dollar at the most . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think you can dance ? " " I can feel the music . " " I ca n't . " " Feel me . " I put Everett 's arm around my waist . " You feel pretty good . " " I 'll feel even better dancing . A me you do n't know a thing about . " We were still climbing . " Did you ever dance with anyone else ? "  | " Yes . " Everett stopped . I kissed him on the cheekbone . " Blix . Le Cid . Le Cid said I was terrible . But it will be different with you . " " Why ? " " You 're not my brother . Le Cid was my little brother . I hauled and pulled him around . I want you to lead . " We were one step from the top , and could see the whole dance floor . I remembered the emotion of the revival meetings . Somethingin the music and the dancers called to me in the same way . Only here , you could not dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was as certain as could be that if Everett and I would put our arms around each other , we would succeed . We would be dancers . We would get better as we went along . We were on the last step . " I 've got the dollar if you have n't . " We were face to face with the dancers now . All ages . All skills . Walkers , trotters , joggers , bouncers , gliders , leapers . Men 's faces were buried in partners ' soft hair . Women snuggled close . Put a sheet over them and what they were doing would look wicked . I had wanted to hurry and had managed to saunter . Now I wanted to dance , and inside me , though my feet were stationary , I was dancing . If Everett would only companion me here , I thought , our lives might change . Take me , glide off with me , lead me . Share this marrow-melting rhythm . I did n't take the dollar from my purse . If we danced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the stairs , nothing between us and dancing but one dollar and willingness . It looked easy to me . It was a merry-go-round . Get on , and the merry-go-round would dance us . There would n't be any question of our having to perform . We would be carried , swept to a conclusion , gold rings as prizes and trumpets blaring in our ears . The dancers circled past us , young and old , agile and awkward . A Mexican couple whirled by , gyrating so furiously her outspreadskirt touched me . She smelled like red roses . He was doing double time , two steps to the beat  |p233Everett  followed the couple with his eyes . " I suppose you 'd like me to dance so that you can pretend that I 'm Manuel . " I had no intention of pretending that Everett was Manuel . I was already , though , and I knew it , pretending that I was Blix , graceful , seductive , alluring . If I did what Blix did , would n't I be Blix ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to dance like Blix  --  with you , " I said . What was wrong with that ? Everett said , " You could n't do that without her partner . " Everett turned and started back down the stairs . I did n't move . The ticket seller evidently thought I wanted to go in alone . " Sorry , miss , " he said . " No tickets to ladies without escorts . " When I remained silent , he decided I needed simpler language . " Sis , " he said , " you ca n't dance without a man . " I knew that . I went down the stairs . Everett was waiting for me at the bottom . The prophetic sparkle of autumn , which had come earlier to Brenner , invested the water and air of Balboa next morning . The inland garden softness of the night before was gone . The bay was still blue , and the wind-blown , watery ridges looked sharp enough to draw blood . The sand glittered with minute glassy igloos . Before we were up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have pancakes for breakfast . Let 's row over and spend the day there . Let 's not plan anything  --  just go and take it as it comes . " I thought : Why not ? The third time 's the charm . Flyers who crash must fly again at once . If we did n't return to town at once , we might never have the courage to try again . With no plans for the day , we put on our everyday clothes . Me , a blue pleated skirt , white blouse , sneakers . Everett , khaki pants , white shirt , work shoes.  |p234The  bay was bluer than the sky that morning , and we rowed hard because we were hungry and in a hurry to reach food . Though he did n't say so , I knew that Everett was sorry that he had walked away from the dance . For no reason , actually , but fear . He cared about the figure he 'd cut as a dancer . I understoodthis . I was the same way myself . Only I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cutting . Everett hoped that he would be given another chance ; he hoped some challenge would come up that he would n't walk away from . We crossed the bay in jigtime , beached our boat , and took the ocean way to town because it was the quickest route to food . It had been a long time and a lot of emotion since those strawberry waffles . I was so hungry I considered eating a piece of kelp . I felt empty and fragile as a shell . If a wave caught me I would ride out to sea like a bubble . We passed a fruit stand , and I bought two Valencia oranges , thin-skinned and waxy . The feel and smell of them reassured me . They were a promise to my stomach that if the worst came to the worst , food was at hand . Everett said , " You 're not going to eat those out here on the street , are you ? And spoil your breakfast ? " " No , " I said . Though I thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might keep me alive until I had some . " I thought we might have a picnic lunch on the beach at noon . " Everett liked that idea . It would be camping out on a miniaturescale . We were lucky about breakfast . We found almost at once a place that suited both of us . Hungry as we were , we were n't choosy . This place had food , looked inexpensive , and was so near the beach that spray from the big waves touched our faces . The place was windowless  --  a kind of shed , really . Roof , floor , and the waist-high wall of a porch . Tables were attached to the wall on one end and supported by a single leg on the other . The diners sat on benches . The food had to be good , since there was nothing else , except it and the ocean , to attract diners.  |p235Everett  and I had to wait for a table . There was no headwaiter , and people , like autoists at crossroads without stop-and-go lights , decided for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead who had come in after us . At crossroads these tactics confused motorists . But here , though startled , no one was confused . They made for tables . It was noblesse oblige ; unusual , but recognizable . I wished Everett would wave me to a table , but I kept my mouth shut . I was determined not to repeat the night before . " Let 's hurry . Let 's dance . Let 's eat . " The diners were a mixture : kids , Waffle Shoppe customers , ukulele players ; dogs rambled around the sandy floor . Gulls perched on the railing beside tables ready to snatch a bite from any unguardedflapjack . People were here because they were hungry . It was too early in the day for them to sort themselves out to fit subtler classification . They were just hungry ; and the big man in undershirt , chef 's tall white hat , and red bandanna kerchief entertained them by keeping eggs , sausages , potatoes , and pancakesin the air like a juggler . A man behind us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beholden to Everett . " Your turn , buddy . " " We 're in no hurry , " Everett answered courteously . " If you are n't eating , get out of line . " " We 're eating , " I said , all my patient Griselda resolves giving way at once . Everett , hungry himself , did n't have a word of rebuke for me . We found a table on the ocean side and had gulls for company . I put my two oranges on the table for decoration and thought , I am happy . Our waitress , a freckled twenty-year-old , gave us water and said , " We 're shorthanded . You may have to wait , but I 'll take your order . " We both ordered the same meal : two eggs , coffee , a stack of hot cakes . The promise of breakfast affected my tear ducts . The prospect of a reunion with food made my hands tremble . " It smells wonderful , " I told the waitress . " Dad 's a good cook , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And he 's fast , " I said . " Fast and good . " When she left , Everett said , " Dad would be better off if his daughter talked less and did more . " " It has n't hurt his business , " I said . I had no intention , actually , of eating the orange . I began to peel it unconsciously , the way you yawn or smile . I was n't looking at the orange or even thinking of it . I was watching the track made in the sandy floor by a baby crawling after a puppy . I was listening to the surf , the kerboom of its arrival , the long suck of its withdrawal . I was smelling bacon and sausages . I was thinking of the freckled girl and her job and wondering if she had only a summer job and went to school in the fall . I thought I would ask her when she came back . I was smiling . I felt at home in a family world , but a world with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see what Everett was talking about . " You do n't peel oranges at restaurant tables , " he said . " Who does n't ? " " No one . No one with good manners . " " Why not ? " " It does n't look nice . " " Some places it might not . But it 's okay here . Nobody cares . " " I care . " I could n't believe it . I just could n't enter into Everett 's mind . The trouble was , I was feeling jolly . The waitress 's freckles , Dad 's juggling , the crawling baby , the booming surf : they took me out of my tight world of failures and resolves . And food , the smell of food ! And the feel of the orange in my hands , and the anticipation of the sweet squirt of its juice in my mouth ! I spoke out of my jolliness to Everett . I did n't take him seriously . I joshed . I also exaggerated , something else he did n't care for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chicken here . You could mash potatoes here and no one would notice . " I put a section of orange in my mouth . It made me drunk with good humor . I held out a section to Everett . Ile tried top237stare some good manners into me . He stared playfulness into me instead . I leaned across the table and placed the orange section against his lips . " Come on , Adam . Try it . Fruit of the passion tree . " Everett looked disgusted . He gave my hand a little bat , and the orange section dropped to the table . I picked it up , put it on top of the railing . A gull flew away with it . Everett , without a word , got up from the table and walked out of the dining room . When the waitress brought our order I told her my husband was n't feeling well , but that I could eat both orders . I could n't even eat my own . The food I had looked forward to as a banquet was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly go down . This meal which was to have been a beginning again was another failure . Poor Everett , wandering starving along a windy beach while I cut into a trembling stack of hot cakes and broke the crisp crust of a delicately browned pat of hashed browned potatoes . Every act of mine since I had arrived at the beach had been selfish and self-centered . Look at the husbands who gambled , drank , cursed , ran after bad women , and got into fist fights ! Where would I find another high-minded clean-living boy like Everett ? What was wrong with me , anyway ? A meal he had planned for our pleasure , and I had driven him from the table with my indecorum ! Find Everett ! Ask his forgiveness . Beg for one more chance . Promise reform . Half of my breakfast and all of Everett 's was on the table when I paid and left . There was no reason now not to hasten . I ran down short streets which dead-ended at the beach . I hastened , panting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I walked the aisles of grocery stores.  |p238Everett  might be buying cheese and crackers to eat on the beach . I looked into hardware stores . Everett might be inspecting rakes and hoes . Once , leaving a drugstore , I was sure I saw him following me a half a block away . My heart , which had been painfully crowding my chest , went back to its normal size . I could breathe again , swallow again . " Everett , Everett , " I called before I thought . Yelling in the streets was nothing that would endear me to Everett . When I reached the corner where I had seen him , he was nowhere in sight . I do n't know how long I ran or where I searched . I darted in and out of stores ; I recognized streets I had been on minutes before . Separated from Everett I was homeless . Without him I had no purpose in being . He was the unfavorable wind against which my stance was canted . Alone , the sound of the sea frightened me . Strangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a bold public peeler of oranges , a secure fantasy-lover . My panic was increased by the tantalizing glimpses I had of him at a distance . I turned a corner and crashed into a man . " Everett , " I cried , thinking I had found my husband . The man turned on me with a strange angry face . A block away , a man with a high pompadour paused , to watch me , I thought . My sight blurred with tears . Everett 's heart had softened ; he was waiting for me . Before I could catch up with him , he turned into a five-and-ten . Inside the store there were no male shoppers to be seen . " Where is the man who just came in ? " I implored of a saleslady . The saleslady looked around . " There is no man here , " she said with the weariness of those required to speak the obvious . " I saw Everett come in . " " Of course you did , " she said soothingly . I saw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man had had wings . I went outside . Sparkling morning of summer by the sea . Where had it gone ?  |p239I  could run no more . I was like a man lost in the forest and running in circles . What I had always known would happen had happened . I had been abandoned . I was truly orphaned . I could n't , like Blix , say , " Hello . So long . " " Do n't leave me " was my only cry . I needed a place to hide , and in my runnings up and down I had seen a church with an opened door . The church did n't , like Everett , appear and disappear . It was where I remembered it , and the opened door was n't an illusion born of my need . The door was truly open , and it stayed open while I walked through it . It was n't a Pilgrim church but I did n't care about that . Or about the flutter of candles and the glitter of crosses and drops of blood from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kneeling , murmuring their prayers and softly shuffling their beads . I had no ritual that would make me one of them . I wanted neither to intrude upon them nor to expose myself . I saw exactly what I wanted . At one side of the church were those cubicles whose purpose I knew , and knew that at this time of the morning priests would n't be hearing confessions . I opened on my first try the wrong door of the three available to me : the central space with its seat for a listening priest and the grille through which he listened . I shut that door quickly . I would no more think of occupying a priest 's domain than of mounting a pulpit . My place was where the sinners confessed their faults . The minute I stepped inside I was comforted . There was a kind of little platform to kneel on , and I sank onto it as naturally as if I had been doing so since childhood . I stopped crying . At first I said nothing . Then I began to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sympathetic and holy , the living ear of God . Did some play-acting enter into it ? Because I was in a confessional did I play the part of a penitent ? I do n't think so . I would have prayed in a telephone booth . Privacy was all I needed . I asked God for his help . " Dear God , " I said , " I have been a bad woman , thinking only of myself . I do not try to pleasep240my husband . Please help me to love my husband as I should . Oh God , make me love Everett . You can do it , God . He deserves to be loved . If I truly loved him I would not do these things to displease him . I have driven him away with my hard heart . Make me love Everett ! " I do n't know for how long I ran on . I did n't ask God to send Everett back to me , because I did n't think that until I had a change of heart this would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again with some unloving act . I took all the blame onto myself . Everett was good and I was bad . " Oh God , make me love Everett as he deserves . " With the first sound from behind the grille I stopped praying . I could play at confessing , alone . But confession was a holy sacrament , and I had too much respect for all things religious to make a priest a part of my game . When the door of my cubicle opened , I looked up expecting to see a priest . At first I thought I was looking at a priest who looked like Everett . It was the other way around . It had never occurred to me that Everett would find fault with what I had been saying  --  if he had heard . What I felt was wonderment at his being there at all  --  and relief that we were reunited . I had n't asked God to send Everett back to me , but God knew what was in my heart . Not Everett . Or maybe he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how did you find me ? " he answered , " I followed you , and now I am through following you . For the first time I 've heard the truth . You have to ask God for help to love me . " I said , " Do n't you want me to love you , Everett ? " " I did , but I do n't any more . I do n't want anything that does n't come naturally to you . I do n't want anything from you you have to pray for . " " You never liked me to pray . Even when it was silent . " " You were probably asking God to give you the strength to love me all along . " He spoke bitterly . " There are women whop241pray that their husbands love them . Why do n't you pray that ? Why do n't you ask God to make me love you ? " The answer was that it was n't necessary to ask God for what you already had . But I was too polite to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . I was still on my knees , and my neck hurt from gazing upward at Everett 's face of stony fury . But I could n't lower my eyes . Everett said , " Well , you are n't going to have to ask God 's help to love your husband any more . You do n't have a husband any more . " With that , Everett closed the door of the confessional . He did n't bang it as he did doors at home when he was mad . He closed it quietly , as if he were sealing a tomb . I heard his footsteps as he left the church . I did n't believe what he said , that I no longer had a husband . But I made no effort to follow him . I rolled the remaining orange , which I still held , around in my hands . It was the cause of all my sorrow . If I had n't bought the oranges , I could n't have peeled one at the table . If I had n't peeled an orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from me . If he had n't run away from me , I would n't have gone to the church and prayed . And if I had n't prayed , I would still have a husband . When I left the church , the midday light , reflected from the sea in wounding shafts , half blinded me . I walked very slowly , my eyes on my feet . I went to the boat , sat in it and waited till sundown , hoping that Everett would come . No one came . At dusk I went back to the place where Everett and I had eaten breakfast . I thought Everett might come there . We would order the same food . I would , as before , start to peel the orange I still carried . Everett , as before , would ask me not to peel it . This time I would listen to him , put the orange down , say , " I 'm sorry . " I would take the road not taken that morning , and a different life would lie ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our pebble house and our ancestral bed . He did not come.  |p242The  freckle-faced girl remembered me . " Where 's your hus-band ? " " I lost him . " " Permanently ? " She was joking . " It looks that way , " I admitted . " I 've waited for him all day . " How sorrowful did I look ? How abandoned ? Sorrowful enough , abandoned enough for her to tell her father . In a lull between orders he came to my table . " Mind if I sit down , sis ? " He was plump from eating his own good food and , at the same time , muscular from running from one end of the stove to the other , keeping the pancakes in the air , the bacon sizzling , and the eggs half sunny-side up and the others once over easy . He was bald ; face and scalp were both a rich kelp color , whether from hot sun or hot stove I did n't know . I was n't accustomed to talking to strangers , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him a kind of host . His name was Clyde Fetters and his daughter 's name was Lucy . The inside muscle of each upper arm was tattooed , the sign to me of a wild and roving fellow , but his face , except for the kelp coloring , was a composite of all the illustrations that have been made for St. Nick ; the same twinkling eyes and nose big enough to lay a finger beside . It was hard not to trust him , and I wanted to trust someone . " Lucy says you 've lost a husband . " I could only nod . " Have a spat ? " Nod again . " What 's the trouble ? " " First , I peeled an orange in here this morning . At this very table . " " What 's wrong with that ? " " Everett asked me not to and I kept right on . So he left . " " That all ? " " No . Next I went to church . " " That 's nothing to quarrel about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in one of those booths and he got in the middle one . How could he get there without my hear-ing ? " " Search me . I 've never been in one of those boxes . Side or center . Do n't Everett care for praying ? " " I asked God to make me love Everett . " Mr. Fetters sucked his teeth . " That puts a different face on the matter . Do n't you love Everett ? " " Not enough . I would n't have put peeling an orange ahead of his wishes if I did , would I ? " " If he loved you , I reckon it would n't have mattered . " This put a new face on the matter for me . What if Everett did n't love me ? What kind of a Santa Claus in reverse was this mahogany-colored St. Nick ? Taking instead of giving ; and by his taking , leaving me light as a feather , about to float in a minute to the top of the world 's highest Christmas tree . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth . " Oh , Le Cid ! Piece on Earth . Everett had left me . It had never occurred to me that Everett did n't love me . I had supposed that he left me because he thought I did n't love him . If he did n't love me , that did put a different face on it . Mr. Fetters saw my confusion . " What 's your plans for the night ? " Until he spoke I did n't have any . " Eat some supper , " I said , " and row back to our camp . " " How 're you fixed for money ? " " I 've got five dollars . " " That wo n't last long . " " I can work . If Everett does n't come back for me . " " I 'm shorthanded . How about waiting on tables ? " " I never tried it . " " Try it . " I tried it that night and could keep up with Lucy . I rowed , frightened of the night and the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Everett had been there I would have clasped
