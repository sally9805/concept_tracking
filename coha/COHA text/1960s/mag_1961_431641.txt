 | I LOOKED down across the moon-bathed face of Mesopotamia to the Euphrates , gleaming like a silver serpent . The night wind moaned through the ruins of the ancient shrine that crowned Nemrud Dagh . Above me , a row of colossal statues ? the crumbed pantheon of aforgottenlXng.domloomed against the stars like shattered sentinels . Beside me , the fallen head of one deity stared sightlessly into the heavens . The classic beauty of the features reflected the glories of a lost Anatolian civilization ? a civilization now being resurrected by our spad , When our Turkish workmen uncover , the great stone head , those staring eyes h , roused some echo of ancestral paganism .

The followi  | night a deluge of rain almost swept us from the sacred mountain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a desperate battle to save ourselves from the all-engulfing torrents . Dawn found us exhausted but successful ? and a bit reflective . The shrine had been erected in the first century B.C. by Antiochus I , King of Commagene . His remains , I am convinced , lie beneath the great stone mound , or tumulus , that caps Nemrud Dagh ; an inscription on the base of the colossal statues calls the site " the topmost ridge " of his kingdom , " in closest proximity to the heavenly throne . . . of Zeus . " Antiochus Considered Himself a God This king , who regarded himself as a god , records that he " undertook to make this holy place a common throne room of all the gods . " Among their brooding images he placed his own statue , together with portrait reliefs of " the heroic company of my ancestors . " Endowing the sanctuary with royal estates and staffing it with priests and musicians , he decreed " everlasting " monthly ceremonies . The tenth day commemorated his accession to the throne ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not record the year of either event . But rituals , feasting , and music marked each monthly festival . I was on Nemrud Dagh ( Mount of Nimrod ) that rain-swept night ? and many another in five seasons of archeological adventure ? because of a professor 's casual suggestion during my student days . I might , he mentioned , make the mysterious monument the topic of a thesis . My first look into the subject gave me not only a temporary goal of scholarship , but the objective of 20 years ' work . In 1882 and 1883 , German and Turkish archeologists had investigated Nemrud Dagh . The catalogues of their findings opened for me a new world ? the lost civilization of Commagene . At the dawn of the Christian Era , the Persian East and the Hellenic West had merged with the local culture of this tiny crossroads kingdom to form a fascinating synthesis of religion , art , and architecture . I knew that I must bring the focus of modern archeology to bear upon this monument of another age . In 1953 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sanctuary , I led an expedition to Nemrud Dagh . The 7,000-foot peak dominates the region that had once been Commagene ( map , page 396 ) . The route from Tarsus to Nemrud Dagh winds across the parched landscape of Cilicia ? a highway of history . Across its dusty plain tramped Xenephon and the heroic Greek Ten Thousand on their way to meet history and the Persians . Here St. Paul trod the weary road of missionary journeys that were to revolutionize the world. * And here , in the eleventh century , grim-faced Crusaders advanced relentlessly toward Jerusalem . That First Crusade has left its traces around Nemrud Dagh . Baldwin of Boulogne ? who later became King of Jerusalem ? carved out a principality at Edessa , a bare 55 miles from the holy peak . He married the daughter of a wealthy chief and encouraged his nobles to wed local heiresses . Though this Frankish fief on the Euphrates endured but half a century , I often encountered in the vicinity of Nemrud Dagh light-haired , blueeyed individuals who may well be descendants of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heat During the first season on Nemrud Dagh. our principal problem was adjusting to a difficult environment . A two-day journey afoot separated us from the nearest village offering supplies and a post office . From day - time highs of 130 ? F. , the temperature on the mountain plummeted to freezing at night Fetching a bucket of water from the closest spring required a three-hour round trip ; there was not a single tree for shade , lumber , or fuel ; on the unsheltered heights we were at the mercy of wind , rain , hail , and dust storms : roving bears added a final touch . We came first to the sacred summit with modest objectives : to survey the shrine , clear the debris , and see if it warranted extensive excavations . Antiochus 's craftsmen had hewn three great courts out of the rock . Upon two of them , the East and West Terraces , had stood similar arrays of statues ? 25 to 29 feet KODACH ROME ? NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SC : -  | tall ? of Antiochus and his gods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guardian eagle and a wall of standing slabs . The workmen had piled the rock chipped from the terraces into a 150-foothigh tumulus upon the mountain peak . Clearing 20 feet of debris from the platform supporting the East Terrace statues proved a formidable task . The summit offered no dumping area for the stones we removed . Workmen had to carry them part way down the slope on litters fashioned from our small and precious supply of wood . Only the Goddess Kept Her Head That first excavation established the East Terrace with its Persian fire altar as the ceremonial center of the shrine . Looking up at Antiochus and his gods ? a ruined pantheon presiding over a ruined Olympus ? none of us could escape a sensation of awe . The very size of the images was overpowering ; upon their platform , itself 20 feet tall , they rose as high as a five-story building ( page 390 ) . These gods combined the deities worshiped by the king 's Greek and Persian ancestors . At the south end of the platform , in ageless serenity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , the Fortuna , or Fertility Goddess of Commagene ; in the center , the " Thunder Shaker " and " Father of the Gods , " Zeus-Ahuramazda ; next , Antiochus ; and finally at the north end , the Hero God of Strength , Herakles-Artagnes-Ares . The implacable ravages of the centuries had decapitated all but one : The goddess had kept her head . Staring at those statues , I marveled at the engineering skill revealed by Antiochus 's  | ctuary , and the royal wealth that made it : sible . Of the Kingdom of Commagene ? Greek form of the Hittite-Assyrian name ummuhu ? we know little . The geographer rabo described it as " an exceedingly fertile , ' - ough small , territory . " In 64 B.C. , the Roman general Pompey entered into a treaty with Antiochus ; thereafter , until its final abrption into the Roman Empire by Vespasian , A.D. 72 , Commagene served as a buffer between Rome and Parthia . The capital , Samosata , 34 miles southwest of Nemrud Dagh , commanded a vital crossing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Today Nemrud Dagh commands a view of arren slopes rolling down into equally barren valleys . Centuries of drought and erosion have reduced most of this area to a treeless , depopulated wasteland . Yet , Commagene , once a renowned producer of cattle and timber , was the richest small kingdom conquered by the Romans . To restore this long-lost fertility , the Turkish Government has initiated large-scale reclamation projects , and an occasional grainfield or vineyard now brightens the upland ( page 402 ) . Our results during that first campaign proved that , archeologically , there was work , and important work , yet to be done upon Antiochus 's sanctuary . On the East Terrace , for example , the early explorers had described a monumental stairway with an altar ? a feature common to Roman temples . How- 397  | ever , our picks exposed not a stairway but a double podium cut in living rock . The upper podium formed a dais running the length of the statues ; here , no doubt , the priests had conducted their rituals commemorating those royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lower podium had held a wall graced by reliefs of Antiothus being greeted by his gods . In addition , our discovery of a rock core underlying the eastern base of the tumulus encouraged my belief that the king 's remains lie in a hewn sepulcher beneath that unstable mass . Our results in 1953 were promising enough to win the continued sponsorship of the American Schools of Oriental Research and the generosity of the Bollingen Foundation and the American Philosophical Society . Back we came the following year to our wind-whipped terraces to commence a full-scale excavation . As my train sped from Istanbul toward Ankara , paralleling the fine roads Turkey has built with U. S. aid , I contrasted the relative ease of our journey with the hardships of my first visit to Nemrud Dagh in 1947 . A painfully slow train carried me from Tarsus to Gelba*i , lying on the ancient route from Malatya to Karkami ? on the Euphrates ' maps , page 396 ) . Chuting down the scale of transportation , I continued via a night truck ? during summer no vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The decrepit , overloaded truck , which should have been decently interred 20 years before , shuddered along the rutted cattle track that served as a road . So violently did we careen that I gained a new appreciation of the word inscribed on the cab : Mashallah , " As God Wills . " But , as the Turks say , " our Kismet was strong , " and we reached the ancient caravan stop of Adiyaman . Nowadays , when members of our expedition stop overnight at Adiyaman , they lodge in a remodeled caravanserai that boasts a hotel , modern shops , and truck shelter . But  | when I first stayed at that caravanserai , few trucks had penetrated the isolated region . Even as in the days of Commagene , animal caravans plied their timeless traffic . I still remember how , through the night , tethered donkeys brayed in the courtyard and camels bellowed . Long before sunrise , the shouting of men and the stamping of animals announced the hour of loading . And , beneath an inky , predawn sky , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not changed for millenniums . I thought of those rugged clays as our expedition plunged deeper into the lost world of Commagene . Enroute to Eskikahta , the nearest sizable village to Nemrud Dagh , my Jeep skirted the Kahta River ( the ancient Nymphaios ) which flows into the Euphrates . Heat waves shimmered across the landscape ; 400 breath-takingly wild and savagely scarred by nature , it called to mind the majesty of the Grand Canyon . Soon there came into view atop a hill the mound of Karakul , the tomb of the royal ladies of the dynasty of Antiochus . An imposing limestone eagle symbol of Zeus ? surmounted a neo-Doric column , probably contemporary with Antiochus I. Two thousand winters had chipped the eagle 's wings and blemished its eyes , but still it kept faithful vigil over the ghosts of the royal harem . A remarkably well-preserved Roma : - bridge , erected during the reign of Empen Septimius Severus , marked the junction the routes that connected Edessa and Samosata with the passes over the Anti-Tauruto Cappadocia ; it also linked Commagene with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Way t ? Nemrud Dagh begins . We toiled on the cx-  | usting four-hour climb , as had the pilgrims Antiochus 's day . In the dozens of times I ended that path , I never failed to thrill at first close-up view of the shrine . For much of the climb , hills mask the holy untain . But at the shepherd settlement of orik , Nemrud Dagh explodes above the rizon . The white cone of the tumulus seems pierce the very heavens . Arriving once ain upon the summit was for me , in a peliar sense , like coming home . Our five seasons of investigation have enled us to reconstruct with a high degree certainty the original plan of Antiochus 's shrine ( see painting on pages 396-7 ) . Foremost among our sculptured finds was a cosal head of Antiochus , dug up on the West errace , that bore a striking resemblance to rtraits of Alexander the Great ( page 393 ) . Two great civilizations met here : The kris of the West Terrace 's south wall elded reliefs of the king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek ancestors . The Anatolian monarch exemplified the same cultural blending process that resulted in Commagene 's uniquely fused gods . He claimed descent from Alexander the Great through his mother , and from the Persian Achaemenid dynasty through his father . Lion Reveals Crucial Date It was on the East Terrace that our picks uncovered fragments of a " Lion Horoscope , " duplicate of one discovered on the West Terrace in 1882 which gained fame as the first known Greek horoscope . Modern scholarship , however , has drawn new light from this ancient assembly of stars . According to Professor Otto Neugebauer of Brown University , this relief of a stylized lion actually conveys astronomical information . Nineteen stars scattered on and near the lion 's body , a crescent moon on its breast , and the conjunction of three planets identified by the Greek words for Jupiter , Mercury , and Mars give the date of July 7 , 61 or 62 B.C.  | This date gives us a vitally important focal point to which we can now relate previously undated monuments of the Hellenistic period . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founding of the sanctuary . We cleared a trench to copy the inscriptions at the bases of the colossi on the East Terrace and located the rock-cut floor of the passage that had originally led to them . At its southern end we uncovered the head of **26;283;TOOLONG , staring into space ( page 391 ) . This was the awesome spectacle that had heralded dire consequences to our workers . On the north wall of the East Terrace we discovered a Greco-Persian portrait of Darius the Great ; on the south wall we found the portrait of a woman , probably Antiochus 's wife or mother . The singular beauty of these portraits , as well as the artistry that had shaped the immense heads of the statues , establishes this sanctuary as one of the glories of the Hellenistic world , not ? as had formerly been thought ? the crude product of a semibarbarian monarch . Excavations Dissipate Mists of History One of our principal objectives ? locating the remains of Antiochus I ? remains unfulfilled . Ominous avalanches of stones engulfed our every effort to tunnel into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , confident that with time and new geophysical techniques we shall find the monarch 's final resting place . Our excavations already have thrown new light into a darkened corner of the past . Now Commagene emerges from the mists of history , a dramatic amalgam of East and West , of Greece , Persia , and Anatolia . And archeology has restored the sanctuary of Antiochus I to its deserved position as a great monument of the classical world . 404
