THE RECRUITMENT A Story by Charles Gaines He was dreaming when Bailey called him at dawn . In the dream there was something wrong : he was confused , hurried ; someone was looking at him with hard final eyes , saving , " Goddammit , Bo , ca n't you do anything right ? " " I 'm sorry , " he said down to the gray patio , " I 'll be down in a minute . " He dressed quickly , still hurried by the dream . Bailey was slumped against the stone railing of the patio , chewing tobacco , his face blank . " I 'm sorry , Bailey , " he said again . " I wo n't do it anymore . " They were through with the work in the vegetable garden by nine o'clock . The sun was already hot and they sat in the shade of the cow barn and drank from the quart milk bottle Bailey kept there full of over-sweetened lemonade . Bo leaned against the barn , his shirt off , swirling the liquid , watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd go if I could . They wo n't take me on account o ' my feet , " said Bailey . Bailey had webbed toes . His father and both his brothers had them too . He showed them to Bo one afternoon this summer , unlacing his boots and peeling back the socks as if he were revealing something very special and fine . He kept cotton wadding between them and his boots and even then they hurt him when he walked long . " I 'd go too , Bailey , but they want people to stay in college . " Bo 's voice was low . He had learned thenight before from his father that his cousin Hugh had refused to go back to college and had joined the Army , but Bo did n't mention this . " Stay in college ! When there 's Japs and Germans killin ' our boys everywhere you read ? I wish to God I could go . " Bailey turned quickly and spat tobacco juice , then turned his head back again slowly . Bo swirled the lemonade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to rise , he said loudly , " Say , Bailey , you know what Devereux said when they asked him if he needed anything after the : Taps attacked Wake ? " Bailey , standing above him , said nothing . " He said , ' Yeah , send us more Ja ps ! ' " In the summer , sunlight was everywhere through the house . It started in Mrs. Blake 's morning room and in Maude 's bedroom above it and moved south and west through Judge Blake 's room and Bo 's ; and downstairs through the tall windows , from the breakfast patio on the east side of the house it fell across the broad white kitchen and flowered walls of the dining room , gleaming everywhere on polished English furniture and brass . In the morning it floated fine and diffuse , and seemed impacted and dry in the afternoon as it shoved against the lead glass and dusty books in the old room upstairs , and against the velvet-covered fur-93 ' Attire . the tapestries and paintings in the living room . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattered on the wooden floor of the roofed pavilion , exhausted by the vines and clumps of bamboo that clutched this detached circular porch with its swings and urns and the wooden merry-go-round animals that stood at intervals within it gazing down on the valley , the town , from this , the very peak of the mountain . All day the sunlight and air pouring in through the tall leaded windows of the house created an atmosphere Wesley loved . He glided and hummed through the house on these days with his girl 's face fixed in a smile , the sleeves of one of the Judge 's old Brooks Brothers . ' shirts rolled to his elbows , and a folded paper sack on his head  --  dusting , straightening , effortlessly leaving behind him an order arranged not just by his neat , womanish , almost white hands , but by his joy : a whole , fastidious well-being , visible on the surface of his face on days like today . And for the first three hours the house was his alone . Harold , the driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then drove the Judge downtown . Wesley could tolerate these day servants  --  a frail , hunched old cook and her daughter . He could even be helpful to them . But for the other of the Judge 's employees , the hulking , redfaced , tobacco-chewing farmer called Bailey , Wesley had only contempt . He was more white than Wesley , but Bailey was uneducated trash : Wesley himself , one quarter white , had been given two years of college by Mrs. Jennings , Mrs. Blake 's mother , with whom he had lived from the time he was ten ( when she hired him to dig up nut grass with a screwdriver from her garden ) until he was-presented to Caroline and the Judge as a wedding present . As his hands patted the new butter into oval shapes , Wesley planned exactly what he would say to this man who would come walking heavily up the rear drive any minute to eat and to stain Wesley 's gleaming back porch with his dirt and tobacco . Dressed in a soft white coat , Wesley had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while passing the dishes and standing behind the Judge as he ate , he had watched these people , listened to their conversation and joined it under his breath . At the head of the glass and wrought-iron table sat Judge Blake , a small man with delicate bones , whose dress and general appearance grew more rumpled every year but whose face middle age had so tightened and defined that its lines and angles , beautiful to Wesley , had become as crisp as those of a crumpled piece of vellum . He rose from his chair when Caroline walked onto the pavilion andagain five minutes later for Bo . Bo had changed his shirt and he carried a copy of the morning newspaper . " You 're late , " the Judge said . " Bailey and I were in the pasture . " Bo seated himself and began leafing through the paper . " The RAF fired D  --  sseldorf with two-ton bombs , " he said . " Your mother and I would like your company . " Bo dropped the paper to the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't calve for another week . We were in the front pasture putting out new salt and they were all back in the woods . " " Check them this afternoon , " said the Judge . Mrs. Blake placed a portion of fruit salad on Bo 's plate . No matter how hot . the day she always looked cool . Her arms were powdered and the bracelets on her wrists made cool dry noises , Wesley loved to watch her . She wore a soft-colored summer dress and sat very straight at the table . " Maude called from town , Bo , " she said . " She got the new administrative job at Shades Valley . She 'll have a double load next year  --  the office work and teaching . " Bo had interrupted her . " What sense does teaching make when there 's a war going on ? Why not just teach everyone to fight ? " And right there Wesley felt the unpleasantness coming . He knew Bo was glad his sister had got the new job ; that he had said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No . Everybody ca n't fight . And the war wo n't last forever . " " You fought , " said Bo . " Yes . " " And you think I should fight . And Bailey thinks I should fight . " He thinks what ? Wesley said , almost aloud . " Eat your lunch , Bo , " said his mother . " Nobody wants to fight . " Passing hot rolls for the second time he stopped at Bo 's side . He bent and whispered something in the boy 's ear  --  a confidential smiling gesture . Bo stared for a moment at his plate , blushing . Mrs. Blake shook the bracelets on her wrist to break the silence . " Marie Anne is dead . " " Who ? " asked the Judge . " The Dowager Grand Duchess of Luxembourg , " said Bo . Then , grabbing at his paper , he said Charles Gaines , born in A tabanta and now twenty-five years old , is working in Green Bay , Wisconsin , on a government project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has done graduate work in the writer 's workshop at Iowa , and this is his first published story . 94 THE RECRUITMENT " Excuse me , Mama , " and walked off the pavilion . Now just let him go , Wesley had assured the back of the Judge 's head . Wesley had decided what to do . " Good aftanoon , Mr. Bailey , " he said , whisking the aluminum tray of butter cakes into the refrigerator . Bailey grunted , shuffling on the stone steps for a moment , half cleaning his boots , then pushed through the screen door and sat at the table . Wesley put a plate of black-eyed peas and pork chops , hot from the oven , in front of him and said , " Hea 's yo ' lovely lunch , " a phrase he offered Bailey every day along with the plate . Then he sat , smiling broadly , on a stool at the other end of the table . Bailey looked up from the plate . Wesley had always gone back to the kitchen after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Bailey . The Negro grinned at him . Bailey 's surprise was in the middle of turning into anger when Wesley said : " Now Mr. Bailey , I know you to be a kind man and I know you loves Mr. Bo dearly as I do  --  who raised him . An ' tha 's why I know you do n't want him over in Gumany or them Soloman Islands where all those boys is gettin ' killed an ' lonesome . " Wesley was talking rapidly through a grin so fixed it was almost a grimace , and Bailey , shocked beyond understanding what the little Negro was saying , stared cow-like back at him , his mouth open , his hands lying like two big chunks of earth by his untouched plate . " You knows how sweet an ' lovely an ' educated this fambly is . Why , this the finest fambly in Alabama you workin ' for  --  look at ' em , all gov'nors an ' judges an ' wealthy men . " There was something unearthly in Wesley 's face now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he found himself fixing on it , fascinated with the outward growth of a sharp unnatural rage beneath Wesley 's puffy benevolent features . " An ' that Bo 's gon na be the finest of all Yes he is . If you educated and refined , there is no doors closed to you . I didn ' raise that boy to see him do anythin ' but what his heart desire  --  to live on this mountain an ' go to his nice college in Virginia an ' see pretty things all his life . So please , Bailey , " calling him that for the first time , " please jes ' teach him how to do farmin ' an ' do n't talk to my boy no mo ' about the waw . " And Bailey saw the face fall for an instant into exhaustion ; then Wesley was pointing to his plate . " Yo ' lunch gettin ' cold , " he said and hurried back into the kitchen . All Bailey could do was sit there , his face blank , his thumbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally he could move , it was nut toward the kitchen , but out the screen doors , stumbling and then half-running toward the pavilion where he knew the Judge rested after lunch . When lie came around the corner of the house he saw the Judge standing , hand on hip , watching the retreating figure of Wesley scuttle off toward the front of the house . " Judge Blake ! " he yelled , making for him as fast as his feet would let him , " Judge , I do n't know what that nigger tol ' you , but it 's me or him , Judge  --  one of us gits off this place today . " Tobacco juice was running down his chin and he made a swipe at it with his forearm , standing now in front of the Judge , ashamed by his approach and confused . So ashamed that his voice the noticed it but could do nothing about it ) kept trailing off in mid-sentence as he explained his version of what had happened ( " when all I to ' him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused by the past ten minutes that when he had finished talking and the Judge said ? " I 've already told Wesley to apologize to you , Sam . He did n't have any right to talk to you that way . I told him to stay off the back porch from now on while you 're eating and you do n't have to see him except for that , " and asked , " Now you do n't want to take this thing any farther , do you Sam ? " ? Bailey could just scratch his boot around in the earth and say , naw , he reckoned not , and begin backing away toward the barn . The Judge sat alone on the pavilion in a wicker armchair . The sounds of lunch dishes being cleared from the table behind him had stopped . His father would have known what to do about Bailey and Wesley . He would have settled it in his mind with one abrupt , final nod . The mountain had been his for thirteen months , since he buried his father on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months had been the most comfortable of his life , A full second growth of timber and the disappearance of all signs of clearing and building  --  all signs of intrusion  --  had allowed him to feel that the mountain and he had achieved the same quality of peace . But recently , an adolescent feeling of vulnerability had disturbed his comfort . His need to deliberate , weigh , the professionally-developed pity , seemed to have become just ways of being accessible . And now there was the war  --  to which ' Bo could either go or refuse to go : he was in school and both he and the Judge knew that if it came to his being drafted out , his father could and would prevent it . But why did Bo not want to go ? He was committed , God knows , to the ideology of a war against fascism and he was excited , or seemed to . be , about war itself  --  that huge , deadly , glamorous pattern of events and responses that had thrilled the Judge into Europe in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had driven his grandfather into the dusty , bitter retreats of 18G4 to fight for a cause he did not even believe He rose from his chair , and from the railing of the pavilion stood looking over the wide sweeps of lawn , his back arched , his hands rubbing down the wrinkles in his suit . Bo was an idealist . He wanted what young people wanted now , and what the Judge too , in one responsible part of his mind , wanted , or supposed he did  --  a world that would accommodate everyone . The Judge was very sure why this war was being fought : it was being fought to preserve the threatened average , and this was a good enough reason . To hate part of what he knew was right was a division he had long tolerated in himself . He knew that social justice was an accommodation to averages and that the world was no longer any place for the pure selfhood , the defiant freedom that had lined his grandfather 's face . Maybe it was the gradual wearing-away of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . social conscience ? begun in his father , increased in himself , and maybe full grown in Bo  --  the loss of unrepressed personal force , that made his son , his home , his life seem so vulnerable , so ... overripe . Yes . Because behind the silver and books and Georgian furniture it was a crude animal force , a way of doing things abruptly , freely , that had always operated the life here . He had seen his grandfather use it a thousand times . And his father . And maybe Bo did not or could not join this war because the residue of that force in him was still strong enough to interfere with the other  --  the self-limiting ideal . And the Judge knew that he would have to see Bo stand up and act or give in completely before he could feel anything like respect for him again . He was tired . He had not decided what to do about Wesley ... he could not decide as his father would have . When he turned , Caroline was standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , looking at his watch . " You do n't really want him to go ? " " Who ? No . I want him to do what he has to do . " he answered . She looked tall and fresh facing him in his wrinkled suit . The constant calm on her face , the graying ash-blond hair , the cool lovely features . She never sweats , he thought . " Well , he does n't have to fight , " she said . " No . I 've got to go . " " I know , " she said , and brushed his cheek with a cool powdery kiss . " He wo n't have to go to war . " a story by Charles Gaines 95 Bailey knew exactly where she would be . They walked through the woods that flanked the pasture on the south to a small clearing . When the cow saw them she tried to get up and Bailey stood at the edge of the woods and calmed her with his voice until she stopped moving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . Beside her lay the stillborn hull calf , its neck bent back so far that the small ears touched its back . The teeth and hooves and the white part of the hide were very clean and bright . It was the finest-looking calf Bo had ever seen , a huge calf with beautiful markings . " Godclarnmit , I told him . " Bailey seemed to be talking to the cow . " That bull was too big . " his voice was soft but his face was raw and enraged ; the anger Bo had noticed in him since lunch was suddenly all across his usually blank features . " We got to get her up . " The cow struggled again when he moved to her . The afterbirth lay across half the calf 's shoulder and was spread in front of the cow like a purple shawl , ragged where she had eaten it . Bailey moved it out of her way with his hoot and talked gently , trying to coax her up . Bo could hear Bailey telling him something but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calf , unable to make himself move . " I said get on her other flank , " Bailey shouted . The cow was lurching , trying to get her feet beneath her and Bailey was hunched , straining on her side . Her face is so calm , Bo thought . .. Be ! , , When he finally moved , the cow had fallen . She lay still , bleeding from the rear . Together they tried once more to lift her but the animal was exhausted . Bailey stood up , sweating and furious . " Go get the tractor . " " Let 's try it once ... " " Go get the goddamn tractor . " He turned , wiping his hands on his overalls . Bo looked at the calf , at the dying cow , at Bailey . Bailey drew his hand across his face , streaking his nose with blood , and squatted by the cow . Bo knew he had finished talking now , that he would be silent , his big mouth chewing loosely , his eyes flat and final until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over quickly and lifted the calf 's head in his hand ; the slickness had dried in the sun and the hair around its jaw was stiff and clean . The head felt coo/ against his hand . After they had palled the cow to her feet with the tractor and led her stumbling and bleeding to the barn , Bo called the vet and Bailey tried to slow the bleeding with de-horning powder . Then they waited in the barn . Bo felt sick and wanted to sit , but Bailey was standing , even the cow was standing , so he stood . " Why did it happen ? " " Yo ' daddy bred her to that Whitcomb bull in Newmerkle an ' he was too big for her . " Bailey looked off into the hay loft . " That was a beautiful calf , " Bo said and immediately regretted it . This was Laura Green , Bailey 's favorite of the nine Jersey cows . Bailey did n't care about the calf . " Bailey , " he said , " listen . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back there . " Bailey looked into the loft and said nothing . " I just could n't move . It was the way that calf looked . " " Yeah , " said Bailey , and spat yellow juice into an S across the concrete floor . " What 's the matter ? " " Your daddy 's cow 's tore up . " " No , I do n't mean that , " said Bo . " Something was wrong when you came back from lunch . " Bailey walked over to a milking stall , his back to Bo . " You want to talk some more about the Blitz ? " Bo asked after awhile . Bailey wheeled on him . " I do n't wantta ever talk to you about Blitz or Philippines or none of that crap anymore . Go up an ' talk to that nigger . " " What Negro ? " That half-white neegro up at the house . You go lying to that nigger about things I say . " Bailey was trembling , his glance still in the loft . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the beginning of the summer he had made many mistakes with machinery and animals and Bailey had corrected them patiently until one afternoon when Bo left the lower half of the door to the milking barn unlatched and unwatched for a few minutes and a heifer the Judge had just bought wandered out of the strange barn and was nearly killed on the highway two or three hours later . Not when they finally found the animal , but as soon as Bo had found Bailey and told him the heifer was missing and why , the man had turned , shouting at Bo a question he had been repeating ever since with his eyes , and his face flooded with the same anger Bo saw there now . " What does Wesley have to do - .. " " Get on outta here , boy . " " Bailey ! " " Get outta ma goddamn barn . " The rain clouds made dark come early . Bo stood at the bottom of the Carters ' front yard beneath a group of hickory trees and watched the clouds rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Above him , Hugh Carter sat in a lawn chair on the patio , his skinny profile and an old studio easel outlined against the still clear northern sky . Hugh was , he had decided , his last hope now . If he wanted to , Hugh could tell him in a few quiet wry words what he should do and how to do it , or at least how he had done it : how he had got off this island . He had known he was trapped since he left Bailey and the cow early this afternoon , pushing and running through the barn door out into the hot air , followed by Bailey 's constant unspoken question . He had realized then , as the hot afternoon swelled around him , that he had been trapped here for seventeen years . He had stopped running when he reached the pasture and had walked westward to the brow of the mountain overlooking the highway , and then south , keeping close to the edge . " We ai n't gon na let you leave , sweet boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wesley had whispered to him . There were three glasses in front of everyone : water , sweetmilk , buttermilk . And a fingerbowl . He screwed his face around and spat . There was Chippendale , ormolu ... horses bred from the best damn Tennessee walking horse in the state , his father said . The best . It was bright on the mountain 's edge  --  sun glinting off the tops of cars , off the glassy reservoir lying huge on the other side of the highway . The homes on the western ridge of the mountain made a lake of it , cutting trees and branches enough to let through a view of water , but no squat concrete buildings or black pipes . Wesley said drink yo ' buttermilk . How could he pull machine guns into place on Guam or shoot down Zeros over China after soaking in buttermilk for seventeen years ? God , he owned a silver-headed riding crop ; he spent vacations at the Homestead . And men in basic training sat together on acres of toilets . His hands were soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creek now and he turned east , walking along its bank back into the mountain , away from the highway . He and Cullom had rented a cabin on the Maury River for next year . They would n't live in the fraternity house  --  ioo close , noisy , and on the river you heard only rapids , birds , and the sound of trees . Cullom would party out there , but that was all right He would have a car . He would be a sophomore . He was through with the nasty part  --  the beanies. the dormitory , initiation . Next year he could walk through Lexington , or drive , withdrawn and mysterious  --  a thin philosophy major , but well dressed , who lived with another philosophy major in a cabin on the Maury . He would have his wines at the cabin . Buy capon in Staunton , and go to polo in Charlottesville with a silver flask for brandy and a dark-haired serious girl from Macon or Hollins who read Hegel . He squinted through 97 the cool dark shadows beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweating , terrified face this morning before Bailey woke him . He was on Bataan . Around him were the diseased , dog-eating troops and he stood soft-looking against the ragged , brilliant landscape , incredibly dressed in a summer sports jacket . He was talking very fast to Wainwright himself . The gaunt , bearded General stared at the ground and would not look at him , but someone behind him whom he could not see was watching and saying in a soft hideous Southern voice : " Goddammit , Bo , ca n't you do anything right ? " As he examined his own dream face he thought of the calmer stronger ones of his father , his grandfather  --  a daguerreotype of his great-grandfather in a gray uniform with gold epaulets  --  and he stood for a long time on the quiet creek bank , as stunned by his heritage as the still-born calf . There were lights on now in the living room and he could see Ellen and Hobart Carter on the sofa . Hugh had nut heard him conic up the hill ; he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easel . Beside him on the flagstones were a palette and brushes . " Hello , Hugh , " he said . His cousin turned a pale cheek without moving in the chair . " Well , hi , Bo . " His voice was uninflected , slow : Bo knew he was still thinking about the painting on the easel . He had covered a small piece of masonite with the thick , bright colors of the flower garden that lay off to the right of the patio . With light , feathered brushstrokes he had painted in the stately scarlet calla lilies partially enclosing a rectangle of purple dahlias , red and yellow zinnias , and marigolds . It was a controlled but vivid and daring painting , and the green pure quality of the mountain air seemed to float within it . Hugh was going , in a few days , from doing this to war . " How did you join the Army , Hugh ? " " Just went down and signed up . " " No , I mean how did you do it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They did n't mind . " Hugh would have been a junior next year at the University of Georgia . His major was painting and he was thought to be very good . His teachers and friends wanted him to enter the big jury shows and exhibitions , but Hugh never did . Of those things he liked he liked the mountain best . and he spent part of each day during his vacations learning its growths and seasons and moods by painting them . He disliked most of the people he knew , including Bo , but few of them knew it : his ugly features , his gauntness , the way clothes lost their shape around him , and his gentleness , made people feel he must like them  --  that he would need to like them . Most of all he disliked his parents : his mother because she allowed alcohol to drown the part of her that would hate the cruel , soft person she now was , and his father because of the feminine aversion to anything unpleasant that made him believe the best way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so got drunk with her . They seemed unreal to Hugh . He did n't really believe them . " I guess I 'll join pretty soon , " said Bo . He sat on the flagstones facing Hugh who did not answer him . " Which theater of the war do you like best ? " " Like best ? " " Listen , Hugh . why did you join ? " " I do n't know exactly . Just a feeling I had school last semester . A lot of the older guys ant some of the teachers were going in . " It was beginning to rain very lightly and Et felt a strange panic rising . " When do you leave ? ' he asked . Hugh stood up , laid the painting gently on the ground and folded the easel . " Monday night , " he said . " Hugh . you know they 've killed over fifty-thousand people in Britain now ? They hit the ports mostly : nydeside , Liverpool , Portsmouth .

Bulls ' eyes rush blinding at me while I wait , hung like a pickup sack at the edge of traffic , striped in lattices of sound and light . Gas smell blooms , a strong flower , from the cogitating pump . Busses sigh , lay gastropodal stinks on the softening asphalt . Sealed cans of motor oil wink in a cartier case . A hood flaps yapping upward like a morning bird cawing . The gas pump hums . My pickup comes . hurry back , y'Majesty . ' " Hugh put his tubes of paint into a paper sack and looked strangely at Bo .

" Look Hugh , what the hell ? I mean do n't you know anything about this war , what we 're doing over there ? We 're fighting against racial aristocracy . Do n't you even know why we 're fighting ? " " I know , " said Hugh , looking straight at him for the first time . " I know . I do n't know all those facts , but ... " " Then how do you know ?

He realized numbly as Hugh turned and walked off the patio that he could never ask him now what he had come to ask . His father met him at the door about a half-hour later . Bo had stumbled across the dark mountain getting drenched with rain . " Your mother was worried about your missing supper . " " I 'm sorry , " he said . " Go up and change your clothes . Then we can talk . " " All right , " he said . When he came back downstairs the Judge was in the living room , sitting deep in an armchair beneath the large portrait of Caroline 's mother . The light above the picture was the only light in the room . The lady was dressed in a pink , 1880s tea gown . In front of her on a low table was a silver tea service and she had always looked to Bo to be asking some invisible companion to take more cream . Her portrait was a soft , alien touch , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the coffee table ; Bo sat on the sofa beside it but did not touch the food . He waited for his father to speak and when he did not they sat together silent for a long time . " You lost a calf today , " Bo said . " I know , " said the Judge . " How ? " " Bailey came no this afternoon to tell me he was quitting . " " It was n't his fault . " " Not because of the calf . . . he and Wesley had a run-in over you . I did n't fire him though . 11 guess T should have . " " Who ? Fire who ? " " Wesley , dammit . I 'm not going lo fire either one of them . And I 'm not letting Sam quit . Because I do n't have to .

" Your mother thinks you ought to have a rest before you go back to school . " He fell sideways on the couch and cupped his face in both hands . " I 'm not going back to school , " he said . He knew the Judge was looking at him and he wondered vaguely if his father could see the terrible alikeness . Bo felt between himself and the painting above him . " I 'm not going back , " he said again . " Arid maybe they will draft me . " " All right , " said his father . " Now sit up . " His voice sounded tired and far away to Bo , but Bailey 's untiring question was close behind him in the still room .
