After duly noting that auto accidents kill 50,000 Americans a year , safety experts generally agree that the use of seat belts would save 10% of those lives and reduce serious injuries by one-third . Convinced by the grim statistics , legislators have made seat belts mandatory on new cars in 32 states and the District of Columbia . Still , studies show that motorists are unimpressed ; they fail to buckle their belts 50% of the time . Now the law is beginning to develop a powerful persuader : failure to use a seat belt may well bar recovery in a personal-injury suit . <P> Unfortunately for Mrs. Kathleen Busick of Milwaukee , she set something of a legal precedent as she inched her family 's brand-new Chevrolet cautiously along an icy street . She braked to a stop behind a bus ; Electrical Engineer Bruno R. Budner 's car skidded into hers from the rear . Claiming assorted injuries as a result of the collision , Mrs. Busick sued Budner for $30,000 . <P> When the case came to trial , it seemed a routine personal-injury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cited a state law that requires all new Wisconsin cars to be equipped with two seat belts . Though her new car was duly belted , Mrs. Busick herself was admittedly unbelted at the time of the accident . As a result , the judge instructed the jury to consider whether Mrs. Busick was guilty of contributory negligence by virtue of having ignored a handy safety device that might have prevented her injuries . <P> Common law imposes on every person a duty to exercise " ordinary care " for his or her own safety . Such care is defined as what " the great mass of mankind " would ordinarily exercise in the same or similar circumstances . And in most states , juries are normally instructed that a plaintiff who fails to take such precautions may not collect ; the plaintiff 's negligence means the defendant gets off scot-free , which seems to be just what happened in Milwaukee . Once the jury received its instructions , it absolved Budner and withheld all damages for Mrs. Busick.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
