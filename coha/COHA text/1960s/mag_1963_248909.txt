Two weeks after President Kennedy gave U.S. traders the go-ahead on grain sales to Communist countries , the Commerce Department authorized the export of 2,600,000 bushels of corn to Hungary . The first sales , involving Minneapolis ' Cargill Inc. and Manhattan 's Continental Grain Co. , amounted to $4,306,860-just a few kernels compared with the $250 million feast that is anticipated when the Communists start buying wheat . <P> If they start buying , that is . Though Russia , Czechoslovakia , Bulgaria and Hungary have indicated that they want 150 million bushels of U.S. wheat in a hurry , some problems remain . A four-man Soviet team headed by First Deputy Foreign Trade Minister Sergei A. Borisov flew into Washington last week to thresh them out . Chief stumbling block is a provision that the President wrote into the deal to help increase its political palatability in the U.S. It requires that the wheat be transported in U.S. ships whenever possible . Since it costs around $20 a ton to move the wheat to Russian ports in U.S. vessels , roughly twice as much as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that provision . And in Moscow last week , Nikita Khrushchev told a press conference that " if the Americans put forth any kind of discriminatory condition to the sale of wheat , then we will not buy wheat in America . " <P> U.S. officials are confident that some thing can be worked out . For one thing , foreign shipping rates have been rising since the Communists began preempting cargo space for Western wheat . For another , the 400-odd U.S. merchant vessels capable of carrying grain may be nearly all booked up anyway when the Russia-bound wheat is ready to move . In any case , said Agriculture Secretary Orville Freeman after a session with the Russians , the situation " looks very promising . "
