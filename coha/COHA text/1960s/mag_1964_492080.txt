Acouple of years ago , in the midst of a McClellan Committee crime hearing in Washington , Sen. Karl E. Mundt of South Dakota was so shocked by a witness 's account of organized racketeering in southern Louisiana that he exclaimed , You have a situation that stinks to high heaven down there in New Orleans ! " The same utterance has been made by officials for 300 years , thousands of times and in three languages , ever since the original French colony of Louisiana  --  later a Spanish possession  --  was peopled by a working force of convicts and prostitutes from the homeland . The stink that assailed Mundt 's nostrils , therefore , is an ancient and cosmopolitan one . And the situation the Senator mentioned has subtleties of evil that are considerably more sophisticated and European in flavor than are found in such cities as Chicago . Thus , the New Orleans area branch of Cosa Nostra  --  one of those identified by Joseph Valachi in last year 's Senate hearings  --  is unique today among the Mafia mobs in America . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high finance . So adept has it become at handling large sums of money  --  both for itself and for the national organization  --  that it is Sometimes called the Wall Street of Cosa Nostra . Its annual income runs to $1,114,000,000 , making it by far the state 's largest industry , according to Aaron Kohn , managing director of the Metropolitan Crime Commission or New Orleans , a private organizationset up by civic leaders in 1954 . The sum is all the more remarkable in that it compares with the estimated two-billion-dollar racketeer take in Chicago and environs. an area with more than five times the population of metropolitan New Orleans . The city of New Orleans itself , with a record of effective law enforcement in the last few years , is comparatively clean today , but its neighboring county , Jefferson Parish , is as firmly controlled by the mob as Cicero , Ill. , was at the height of the Capone era . In fact , the town of Gretna  --  directly across the Mississippi River from New Orleans  --  is known as " the Cicero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart of Gretna on page 18 shows no less than 14 mob locations , most of them no more than a stone 's throw from police headquarters . These places alone do an estimated $250-million-a-year business in gambling , prostitution , narcotics , burglary , hijacking , usury and mayhem . One of the mob properties , the Billionaire Lounge . is directly across the street froin the entrance to the police station and is frequented by Gretna police . In it recently I was offered a number of illicit distractions  --  a $20 prostitute , $10 worth of barbiturates , and gambling in the form of ' a slot machine , three blackjack tables and a completely equipped horse-betting room behind a wide-open door at thqJear of the lounge . 4ff- Other mob-owned or controlled:Buildings in the harmonious cluster around the poke station house ? NEW ORLEANS a firm  --  Inch places illegal slot machines and ' layoff ' pinball machines in bars , the biggest lay-off bookie tenter 11. et in the area ( at 3301 ? Hues P. Long A% emit. ) . and a building listed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents strongly suspect is the brain center of a big-time burglary and holdup ring operating in the **28;2330;TOOLONG area . HoweNer , an even more interesting example is another building. , a few blocks away , which the Cosa Nostra neither owns nor operates . It is a cavernous illegal gambling casino in which I played blackjack , roulette and keno , and where we photographed the action with a tiny camera secreted in a cigarette package , Among the operators of this establishment , the New Garden Club  --  according to federal gambling stamps issued to them at that address  --  are Joseph A. Miller , John P. Kremer Sr. and Michel W. Kremer . All three are relatives of Gretna 's chief of police , Beauregard Miller Sr. As the Crime Corn-mission 's Aaron Kohn put it , Not even in Tangier was there ever a cozier arrangement between the mob and the law . " According to McClellan Committee testimony , the overlord of the local mob is a former thug and narcotics peddler named Carlos Marcello , known variously as " The Big Man , " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , four inches in his elevator shoes  --  or simply The Man . " Marcello is far more urbane than such Cosa Nostra peers as Chicago 's Sam Giancana and New York 's Vito Genovese . In his rare public appearances  --  usually in a courtroom  --  he is a suave , graying 54-year-old with a mild manner and a practiced air of injured innocence . He wears well-tailored 5300 suits which differ from those scorn by other successful businessmen only in that he has had triple-sized pants pockets sewed into his clothes . These are for the huge sums of money he almost always carries with him . Just as Marcello is more urbane than men like Giancana , the Syndicate 's methods in the New Orleans area are more sophisticated than those in , say , Chicago . A case in point is that of Walter Richardson , a Jefferson Parish barkeep who recounted his woes  --  on the record  --  to the McClellan Committee . He had been peacefully using a jukebox in his establishment for some time , he said , when he was visited by two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to get rid of his old machine and install one belonging to the Huey Distributing Company , a notorious mob outfit . The officers were Malcolm Coci , the chief criminal deputy sheriff , and James Arnoult , the chief civil deputy sheriff . When Richardson refused , the deputy sheriffs simply delivered the Huey box and plugged it in . When Richardson , in turn , unplugged the mob-operated box , he was neither beaten nor bombed . Instead , sheriff 's deputies proceeded to raid his bar every Friday and Saturday night for two months . never filing charges but arresting and searching Richardson 's customers . Richardson finally ended the harassment by having the courage to tell his troubles to federal authorities  --  but in thousands of similar unreported cases the technique has been inordinately successful . " For the most part , " says Aaron Kohn , " the philosophy of our mob is : Why risk the penalties of the law when you can use the law to impose your penalties for you ? " This philosophy applies equally to other mob enterprises . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days is " shylocking " ? usurious moneylending . In other cities , when you borrow from Cosa Nostra shylocks at the usual rate of 240 percent a year , the penalty for nonpayment is generally death , arson , torture or a combination of all three . In the more urbane Louisiana Cosa Nostra the mob is satisfied with mere confiscation . A typical Cosa Nostra shylocking contract recently fell into the hands of the Crime Commission . It called for repayment of a 54,000 loan with a fiat $7,500 , plus an additional eight percent interest on the entire $7,500 , plus a mortgage , which , in the event of default , would allow the mob to acquire a 520,000 property . By this method , among others , Cosa Nostra members have acquired properties worth tens of millions of dollars in , Jef-ferson Parish alone . The New Orleans Crime Commission has compiled a partial lile of court-recorded real-estate acquisitions by local mobsters , and the tile is already three inches thick . The Commission 's files also show mob involvement or ownership in banks , truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finance companies , linen-supply services , beer and whiskey distributorships , shrimp fleets , shipbuilding firms , taxi and bus companies , souvenir shops , gas stations , ceramic-tile companies , phonograph-record wholesalers and shops and electrical-appliance stores . Income from these and similar enterprises , Aaron Kohn estimates , accounts for about $400 million of the Cosa Nostra 's annual billion  --  second only to the $500 million take from illegal gambling . Another $100 million comes from illegal operations in 1,500 mob-controlled bars ( 8-drinking , watered whiskey , rolling of customers and the like ) ; 58 million from professional holdups and burglaries ; $6 million from prostitution . And $100 million represents , in effect , income from Uncle Sam , in the form of nonpayment or underpayment of taxes . All in all , it adds up to a lot of money . Too much money In town " In fact , " says Frank Klein , chief assistant district attorney of Orleans Parish ( New Orleans ) , " we think there 's too much money here . We feel that it 's flowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country for investment by the local mob . This could be their financial center , with a lot of nice safe places where campaign contributions and outright bribery have pretty well insulated them from the law . " The Federal Government , too , is concerned with the flow of mob money into the Cosa Nostra 's Wall Street in southern Louisiana  --  but for a different reason . A Justice Department official says , " Our Number One problem in the organized-crime field today is stopping the illegal outpouring of racketeering income  --  such as unreported money from the Las Vegas gambling casinos  --  from the United States to bank accounts in Panama . These bank accounts , like those in Switzerland , have numbers and no names , and once the money gets into them it ca n't be traced . Then it flows back into the United States as legal money and it is used to finance other mob operations . " There is certainly no place in the United States from which it would be easier to export Syndicate money to Central America . Thcrc is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries as Guatemala , Honduras and El Salvador  --  all just a short jump from Panama . Also , the sea routes arc wide open . Louis LaCour , U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana , recently pointed to a map on his wall and said , " Just look at that coastline . Literally thousands of coves and bayous , where the mob 's shrimp boats could put in and leave a hundred times a day and we 'd never know it . The whole U.S. Navy could n't guard that coast and the uninhabited swamps behind it against sneak shipments of money , narcotics , anything  --  any more than it could have stopped Jean Lafitte , the pirate , in the days when he was operating there . " The reference to Lafitte was interesting , since the New Orleans area Cosa Nostra can trace its spiritual if not its blood lineage back to that suave early-I9thcentury cutthroat . Actually , today 's Cosa Nostra had its beginnings in the 1880 's when Sicilians in great numbers began to pour into the United States , mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become fine upstanding citizens , but with the immigration wave came members of the dread Sicilian Mafia , who established their first and longest-lasting American foothold in New Orleans . They quickly inaugurated a reign of terror among law-abiding Italian-Americans , and for several years they engaged in open warfare with Louisiana authorities . They murdered New Orleans police chief Dave Hennessy in 1890 , and once the state militia had to be called out to prevent them from storming a prison and releasing Mafia members who were under sentence of death for belonging to the organization . With the beginning of the 20th century , the Mafia began to merge with other gangsters of Jewish , Irish , French and Spanish descent and the present subtle sophistication of the mob began to replace the crude , bloody methods of the so-called Black Hand . The leadership , however , remained in Sicilian hands . Sam Carollo ruled the Syndicate until he was deported in 1947 . Carollo established the mutually satisfactory system of working with the police instead of against them . This resulted in the incredible situation  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceedings  --  in which not only were there wholesale graft payments to the New Orleans police to purchase immunity for racket operations , but some police officials actually were in the rackets themselves , owning and operating gambling establishments , lotteries and houses of prostitution . These disclosures led to mass firings of cops in the 1950 's and resulted in the current comparatively clean situation in the city of New Orleans itself . But the mob merely consolidated its operations in Jefferson Parish and other neighboring localities , where the officialdom continued to be cooperative . With the deportation of Caron() in 1947 , Carlos Marcello ascended to the throne . In the 1961 McClellan Committee hearings , Aaron Kohn testified : " Carlos Maccello . is the most powerful , most in-fluential , the most sinister racket boss in Louisiana . His wishes are considered orders by numerous persons in public office , obligated to him for their election or appointment to authority . ... His activities and interests extend across the State of Louisiana and beyond its borders into Texas , Mississippi and elsewhere . " Marcello conducts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the million-dollar Town and Country Motel ( of which he is an owner of record ) and from another luxury motel in the New Orleans area . He lives in a S125,000 mansion in an exclusive section of Jefferson Parish , directly across the street from the posh Metairie Country Club ; and for relaxation he goes to his lavish duck-hunting preserve , " Churchill Farms , " in the almost-inaccessible marshes near New Orleans , or to his " fishing camp , " a sumptuous white frame dwelling at Grand Isle on the Gulf of Mexico . Both of these rural retreats are well guarded and have boat landings for the shrimp boats and other craft which ply the Gulf on his business . He frequently uses these hideaways  --  leaving his wife Jacqueline and his three children at home  --  to entertain judges , sheriffs , district attorneys and other allies , with lavish dinners . ( In the old days , when less heat was on , he used to sup publicly with these officials at the many line Jefferson Parish restaurants which he owns or controls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build a new image of respectability , he also has befriended several Louisiana clergymen , one of whom , a Baptist minister , presented him at a revival meeting as " a brother who once was fallen but who now has found Christ . " So jealous has Marcello become of his reputation that one or more of his 46 attorneys now threatens libel suits against news media which have used or might use such terms as " gangster " or " mobster " to describe him  --  a warning which has generally been heeded by both the New Orleans Tin/es-Picayune and the New Orleans States-hem , but not by the three New Orleans television stations . Despite the efforts of his battery of attorneys and publicists , Marcello has found it difficult to shake his record as a hoodlum . His real name is Calogeto NI inacori , and it is pretty well established that he was born in 1910 to Sicilian parents in the city of Tunis in North Africa . He was brought to the United States by his father and mother when he was eight months old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Algiers . By the time he was 21 years old  --  a birthday that he celebrated in the Louisiana State PenitentiaryNEW ORLEANS he had already had an impressive career in crime . At the cigc of 19 he was charged with being an accessory in a bank robbery . When he was barely 20 he was sentenced to 9 to 14 years at hard labor for assault and for burglarizing a grocery store , using two boys , 13 and 16 years old , as gun-wielding accomplices . Although he served nearly five years in the Angola penitentiary , neither the crime nor the incarceration appears on Marcello 's record . The manner in which they were expunged no doubt taught the young man the value of the criminal-politician alliance which he was to use so effectively later on . This was the period when notorious New York gangsters Frank Costello and " Dandy Phil " Kastel moved their vast slot-machine rackets to New Orleans at the behest of Huey Long , after they were kicked out of New York by Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia . One of their partners in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state legislature while at the same time owning and operating two profitable bookie joints . Costello and Kastel needed a young man who knew the Algiers section and could handle their slot machines there . They apparently decided that Marcello fitted the bill , and Hand took on the task of getting him sprung from prison , though he did n't even know the youth . In a remarkable tape-recorded confession to Aaron Kohn of the Crime Commission just before Hand died a couple of years ago , he explained how he obtained a full pardon for Marcello . " Oscar Allen was governor , and favors were very easy to get for a fellow like me , because I was a very good administration man , " Hand said . " So it was n't a hard job for me to get him a parole or a reprieve . 1 just went in to Governor Allen and told him I know this boy 's people for so many years , and it was the first time he was in trouble , and it took me about five minutes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Costello-Kastel combine , and learned all the tricks of his trade . He also dabbled in narcotics on the side , and in 1938 he was picked up by federal agents as part of " the biggest marijuana ring in New Orleans history . " He pleaded guilty on October 29 , 1938 , to the sale of more than 23 pounds of marijuana and was sentenced to the Federal Penitentiary in Atlanta . When he emerged the following August , he was older and wiser . Although his subsequent record is studded with arrests and complaints for crimes such as assault , and even a conviction ( reversed on appeal ) for contempt of Congress , he has never spent another day in jail . The closest he came to any sort of incarceration was during the Government 's 11-year attempt to deport him as an undesirable alien . He has been under a continuous order of deportation since February , 1953 , after the Kefauver Cornmittee 's revelations about his crime over-lordship in Louisiana , and the case has some of the overtones of a Gilbert and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacob Wasserman of Washington , D.C. ? possibly the nation 's most skilled immigration lawyer  --  Marcello spent an estimated one million dollars in an unsuccessful fight against the deportation order , going all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court . But Italywould n't take him and neither would France  --  his birthplace , Tunis , was in a former French protectorate  --  and neither would the new nation , Tunisia . Finally , in April , 1961 , a strange birth certificate showed up indicating that a Calogero Minacori had been born in the obscure village of San Jose Pinula in Guatemala . The dale of birth and the name of the parents matched Marcella 's . At one P.M. on April 4 , 1961 , Marcello walked into the District Immigration Office at the Masonic Temple in Jefferson Parish for his required routine quarterly appearance . Before he had a chance to open his mouth , he was seized and handcuffed by Immigration officers , rushed to the airport in an Immigration Service car , and by I : 30 ? a half hour from the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Guatemala City in an Immigration Service plane , officially deported . The not-welcome mat But the deportation was short-lived . Marcello barely had time to settle in his Guatemala City hotel suite and establish contact with local entrepreneurs who wanted him to take over Central American slot machines , racetracks and gambling casinos , when the public outcry over admission of such a notorious personality rocked the Guatemalan government . On May 3 , 1961 , eight secret agents took Marcello from his hotel under a Guatemalan deportation order and unceremoniously deposited him at the El Salvador border . The El Salvadorans whisked him across their country and deposited him on top of a mountain in the wilderness at the border of Honduras , from which point he had to walk 17 miles to the nearest village . Marcello , apparently out of condition , claims that he fainted three times during this journey and that he fell and fractured several ribs . Actually , the details of Marcello 's bizarre itinerary did not come out until later . At the time , U.S. agents knew only that Marcello had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month . Significantly , just before his disappearance , he was photographed at the Guatemala City racetrack with Felice Golino , the biggest shrimp-boat-Fleet operator in the Gulf of Mexico . The mysterious Golino has been identified in newspapers as Marcello 's uncle and , by the Metropolitan Crime Commission of New Orleans , as Marcella 's partner in various enterprises , including the shrimp fleet . In any event , the Golino fleet was operating off the coast of Honduras in late May , 1961 , when Marcello was there . On June 1 Marcella was reported as having been seen in Grand Isle , La. , near his fishing camp on the Gulf of Mexico . On June 2 a Marcello lawyer notified the U.S. attorney in Shreveport , La. , that Marcello had reentered the country illegally and that he would surrender voluntarily the next day . On June 5 Marcello 's attorneys met Immigration agent Bruce Hernstad and drove him less than a mile to Mar-cello 's Jefferson Parish home . They honked the horn , and out strode Mar-cello . He bade everyone a cheery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few days at the Federal Alien Detention Center in McAllen , Tex. , and was released on bond while the Government faced the same old problem  --  that no country would accept him for deportation . Marcello was subsequently indicted for conspiracy to commit fraud in obtaining the fake Guatemalan birth certificate , for committing perjury in swearing he had nothing to do with obtaining the fake birth certificate , and for unlawful reentry as a deported alien . Marcella is yet to be tried on the perjury and illegal-reentry indictments . Last November , however , he went to court on the conspiracy charge in New Orleans , and this episode merely added another bizarre chapter to the story . The principal Government witness was an ex-convict named Carl Noll . Noll testified that he had been a " runner " for Marcello-controlled bookie joints in New Orleans and that , after he got Carlos Marcello 's personal OK , he was allowed to borrow money from a Marcello henchman and run a bar which featured the henchman 's gambling operations in the back room . In 1956 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consummate business of his own and met the Guatemalan minister of the interior , Eduardo Rodriguez Genis , and Genis 's law partner , Antonio Valladares . It was about this time that a Marcella deportation to Italy seemed imminent , and Noll testified that Marcello asked him to try to obtain either Guatemalan citizenship or a Guatemalan birth certificate for him  --  on the theory that if he was deported to Italy , he could immediately fly to Guatemala , which would be much closer , by private plane , to his operations in Louisiana . Noll said that the minister of the interior provided him with a car and chauffeur and that he and Valladares drove from village to village in Guatemala looking for a birth ledger which would have room for an additional entry on February 10 , 1910 , the day Marcello was born . They finally found such a page in the ledger of the hamlet of Sari Jose Pinula . They paid an old man to mix up the type of primitive ink used at that time and to write in the name Calogero Minacori @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister of the interior issue a birth certificate based on this entry , and they flew with it to Marcello in Louisiana . It was testified that this birth certificate was subsequently filed with the Italian government , which is presumably how it later fell into the hands of the American authorities . At the November trial the U.S. Government attorneys supported Noll 's story with airline and hotel records and with witnesses from Guatemala , including the chauffeur who had driven Noll to the Guatemalan villages . Marcello 's attorneys concentrated on discrediting Noll as a witness , pointing to his six previous convictions as a con man and swindler . The jury was out for exactly an hour and 35 minutes on November 22 before returning a verdict of not guilty . The acquittal gave rise to a current local joke in New Orleans : " Carlos probably will be kicked out of the Cosa Nostra , now that they 've found out he 's a Guatemalan and not a Sicilian . " As the joke indicates , the average citiien of New Orleans and environs does not take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , a good many people seem to consider him a sort of Robin Hood-type folk hero . Members of the Syndicate  --  and those who have business relationships with it  --  are under no such illusion . Even though the mob generally eschews murder , Cosa Nostra discipline can be harsh . Sonic years ago , for example , the mob found it necessary to chastise a sublieutenant who had been guilty of a lapse which , in Chicago or New York , almost certainly would have resulted in his trussed-up body being found stuffed into the trunk of an abandoned car . The hoodlum , a hulking , gorillalike man of less than standard intelligence , is a mob prostitution specialist named Peter Ysasi . In 1952 Ysasi got into an argument with one of his mob superiors in a bar in the French Quarter of New Orleans and shot him in the leg . Ysasi was thereupon taken to Arabi , La. , to the home of Mike Roach , managing director of prostitution operations for the mob . Ysasi 's wrists were broken , he was partially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a red-hot flatiron . When he recovered from this exercise in discipline , bygones were allowed to be bygones , and Ysasi went back to work at his old stand . Because the mob generally manages to avoid publicity about such matters , however , the citizenry continues to be unimpressed by the extent of Syndicate power in the New Orleans area . " Our biggest problem is the attitude of the people , " says New Orleans police superintendent Joseph I. Giarrusso . " We closed up half of the mob-operated strip joints on Bourbon Street and elsewhere in the city because tourists were being drugged or getting their heads hashed in and robbed in them . But we ca n't close up the rest because certain businessmen feel that , with no place to sin , the tourists wo n't come to New Orleans anymore . The bookies come across the line from their main base in Jefferson Parish , and we raid them ; the prostitutes come across the line from Jefferson Parish on a call-girl basis , and our Vice Squad makes arrests nearly every night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slap-on-the-wrist lines and they 're back again . Our people just ca n't understand that what seems to them to be a little harmless gambling is really tied in with far more serious clinics . They ca n't understand that these are not just local boys they 've known all their lives and that they really are tied in with the national crime syndicate . " With a local press that reports such matters only perfunctorily , it would probably shock most residents of the New Orleans area to learn what some of their supposedly harmless local boys are up to . Nick Nuccio , for example , has been a chief Marcello lieutenant for years a well-known man-about-town with a profitable 54,000,000-a-year bookie business . He has handled football and race-track bets for some of the leading citizens in the area . Last September 27. however , he was caught in the act of burglarizing the safe ? fa large dairy near Baton Rouge , La. , and was captured after a gun battle ith the police . He was sentenced to the State Penitentiary for ten years on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and narcotics . " This harmless local boy is a gunman , a shylock , a trafficker in burglar tools , " the Crime Commission 's Aaron Kohn said recently . " His common-law wife , Debbie Nuccio , is a notorious prostitute . And we NEW ORLEANS have evidence that Nuccio participated in burglaries in Jefferson Parish for years , but he seemed to enjoy an immunity from arrest and prosecution . His big mistake was pulling a job in East Baton Rouge Parish . " Marcello 's personal involvement with illegal activities is hard to establish . For one thing , he has placed control of many of his operations in the hands of his six younger brothers , Peter , Pascal , Vincent , Anthony , Joseph and Sammy  --  all of whom were born in the United States and are therefore not subject to deportation , as he is . Since his first clash with the Immigration authorities in 1953 , moreover , he has not even acquired any of his vast collection of properties in his own name but has used fronts . He himself is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of a number of properties , including the rambling warehouse-like structure which houses the Old Southport Club in Jefferson Parish  --  the biggest gambling casino in the area . Yet it has not been established that Marcello has anything to do with the gaming inside , and it is perhaps a coincidence that one of the casino 's managers , Salvadore Boemia , has frequently been spotted by the Crime Commission at Marcello 's home at 7:30 P.F.1 . When Boemia leaves , with what might be a bag of money , he goes straight to the Old Southport Club , where gambling begins at eight P.M. , immediately after his arrival . About a year ago , under public pressure , deputies of Jefferson Parish Sheriff Jack Fitzgerald visited the place and  --  with some 200 patrons ' cars parked outside  --  reported the bui lding to be " boarded up , unused and unoccupied . " How can such longtime immunity continue to exist ? A clue to the answer lies in the story of two recent secret meetings uncovered by this reporter , in which Carlos Marcello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during Louisiana 's primary-election campaign . A candidate for sheriff of Jefferson Parish was approached by a henchman of Marcello 's who said , " The Little Man would like to see you . He just wants to ask you some questions , and if you give the right answers , there 's 550,000 for you . " Thecandidate went to see Marcello , and the Little Man said , " I just want us to be friends . You understand , of course , that I 'm not mixed up in the rackets anymore , but I 've got a lot of friends who arc , and after all , what are friends for except to do favors ? " The Little Man then asked just one question : " You believe in home rule , do n't your ( In Louisiana , home rule means one thing : nonenforcement or relaxation of state criminal laws by a sheriff against the racketeers in his locality . ) The candidate said he was against home rule , which was the wrong answer . The interview then was abruptly terminated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close friend of Marcello , a tremendous amount of money was spent to defeat him , and he was badly beaten in the first primary . The second of Marcello 's secret meetings took place a short time later . On this occasion the party of the second part was an official in the office of crusading New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison . The DA 's man was dining in a Chinese restaurant one night when a hoodlum came over to his table and made the same approach : " The Little Man would like to see you . " The official was driven to Marcello 's remote swampland hideaway , Churchill Farms , where he was wined and dined by the Little Man . Then Marcello said , " We got a new type of electronic slot machine , and we want to get back into the city of New Orleans with it . All we want from your boss is for him to do his job . We 'll put out two of the machines and we want Garrison to seize them . Then we 'll bring a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just do n't want Garrison to raise so much hell that it goes to a higher court . After we get the machines ruled legal , we 'll put three hundred of the machines in the city , to start . Garrison will get ten dollars per machine for doing this favor for us  --  or three thousand dollars a week . " Like Marcello 's offer to the candidate for sheriff , this bribe was refused  --  something that has n't happened often in Louisiana history  --  and promptly reported to the Crime Commission . This is quite a tribute to Aaron Kohn , the Syndicate 's most implacable foe over the last decade . Kohn , a former top FBI agent , has based his entire anti-Cosa Nostra campaign on the election and appointment of honest officials and on hounding them until they dry up the main sources of sustenance for the mob  --  vice and gambling . The campaign finally is bearing fruit , with cleanups in New Orleans and neighboring St. Bernard and St. Charles parishes . Now only Jefferson Parish remains . " But , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kremlin , the Citadel . It will take a long time to fall . " The assault may soon begin . In the recent elections a forthright young lawyer named Alwynn Cronvich was elected sheriff of Jefferson Parish over several openly mob-dominated candidates . " I will enforce the laws , " Cronvich says . " I 'm going to close down gambling and prostitution and narcotics trafficking wherever 1 find it . " If Cronvich means what he says  --  and Kohn believes he does  --  Louisiana 's crime empire will receive a serious blow in June , when Cronvich takes office . " Serious , but not necessarily fatal , " says Aaron Kohn . " Never forget that these men have developed the art of crime to such a sophisticated degree that they can go underground and still survive with their vast financial operations , and so on . The answer really lies with the people . When I make speeches , citizens complain to me about the United States Government spending a million and a half dollars of the taxpayers ' money to try to deport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people , are financing Marcello by putting money in his slot machines and placing what they think are innocent bets with his bookies . I tell them that this is the money that enables him to hire the best lawyers , whom the Government ca n't afford to hire , and he defeats them . " Kohn concluded sadly , " It 's the same old story throughout the United States . The governed are defeating their government through the financing of the offenders . "
