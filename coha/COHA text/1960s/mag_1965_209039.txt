The more that doctors learn about head injuries , the more concerned they are that not nearly enough is being done to protect accident victims from the long-lasting , possibly paralyzing or fatal effects of insidious brain damage . The main reason is that gross injuries to the brain often go undetected and even unsuspected . <P> The severity of the head-injury problem is increasing with spreading industrialization . Accidents have become the leading cause of death among Americans aged one to 37 , and head injuries are among the commonest and deadliest of all accidents . They cause at least 15,000 U.S. deaths each year , and , are suspected of causing many more , notably in auto accidents where there are multiple injuries . <P> No Symptoms . At the Third International Congress of Neurological Surgery , just concluded in Copenhagen , doctors from all over the world reported with alarm on the difficulty of diagnosing head injuries . " Among the problems , " said Baltimore 's Dr. A. Earl Walker , " is that one-third of all patients suffering from blood clots inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly technical means of determining whether there is a blood clot , and then locating it , but this needs expensive equipment which is not generally available , as well as expert personnel . It ca n't be done in every small town . But we suggest that centers be set up and kept open 24 hours a day with these facilities . " <P> <P> One of the newer detection methods is echoencephalography , working on the same principle as sonar . When sound waves are bounced in and out of the head and converted into a light pattern , the neurologist can see whether the brain has been shoved to one side by blood or a clot . Injections of radiopaque dye also help X rays to show whether arteries have been displaced or damaged enough to deprive part of the brain of its blood supply . Even using these techniques , doctors do not always discover everything . <P> Treacherous Crash . How elusive damage can be is shown by the case of a garageman , cited by Neurosurgeon Arthur Winter of East Orange , N.J. The young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off a jack , but he did not become unconscious or even dizzy , went right back at work underneath the car . That evening he lost his dinner and seemed dazed . At the hospital , no mark was found on the skull , so surgeons had to drill holes in it and search for the trouble . They discovered a mass of blood and drained it . The mechanic eventually recovered his mental alertness but , four years later , he still has only limited use of his right arm . <P> Post-mortem studies show that , with prompt detection and proper treatment , half of those who die of head injuries could have been saved . Lasting or delayed disability could be similarly reduced , reported Pakistani-born Dr. Ayub K. Ommaya , of the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness at Bethesda , Md . Detection , however , is doubly difficult in the peculiar and treacherous kind of injury known as " whiplash " - the result of the sudden forward-and-backward snapping of the head that is common in rear-end auto accidents . <P> <P> Invisible Damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a direct blow on the head and leaving no scratch on the skull , may nevertheless cause bruises and hemorrhages in the brain . <P>
