txt Joseph ( Joe Bananas ) Bonanno , who was reported kidnapped two months ago in front of a Park Avenue apartment building hours before he was to appear before a Federal grand jury , is " safe and sound , " according to his lawyer . " I asked that he appear in my office on Monday at 9 A. M. ready to appear before the jury , " the lawyer , William Power Maloney , said yesterday . " I 'm convinced that he 'll be here . " Mr. Maloney , who had given the police an eyewitness account of the alleged kidnapping , said that he received a local telephone call from Bonanno 's son , Salvatore , shortly before noon yesterday . " He told me his father was in good health and ready to appear , " Mr. Maloney said . Bonanno , alias Peppino Bonanno , alias Johnny Mananas , alias Johnny Boventine , alias Joseph tonaventura , alias Joe Bananas , is reported to be a racket czar whose operations have involved much of the nation from Brooklyn to Arizona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high New Yolk police official said there was little likelihood of Bonanno 's ever being found alive . It was widely held in official circles that he had been executed by fellow Mafia chiefs to keep him from talking to the Federal jury , which is investigating organized crime . But since . that time 45 witnesses have appeared before the jury , including two of Bonanno 's lawyers , Mr. Maloney and Lawrence P. D'Antonio of Tucson , Ariz . It has been learned that as a result of this testimony , Federal officials have become convinced that the kidnapping was a hoax , a device used by Bonanno to evade appearing before the jury . The Federal officials feel that the case they have been building is now forcing Bonanno either to come out of hiding or to let some close advisers go to jail . But Mr. Maloney , the small . baldish lawyer , his face flushed with anger , said , " Hoax  --  hell ! I 'm convinced that this was a real kidnapping and I 'm relieved to know that my client is alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that his brief conversation , " maybe five minutes , " with Salvatore Bonanno had convinced him that details of the " kidnapping " as they have appeared lately in newspaper stories written by Walter Winchell were correct . Mr. Winchell said that he had learned from " underworld sources that Bonanno had been kidnapped by a certain " M , " of Buffalo . It was reported that Bonanno had been questioned by the grand jury about Steve Maggadino or his brother Tony , and possibly both . The two , are reported to be Mafia chiefs in the Buffalo area . Reported Held Upstate The chunky , husky , 59-yearold Bonanno , according to Mr. Winchell 's story , was held captive at a farm in upstate New York . No explanation was given either by Mr. Winchell or Mr. Maloney as to why Bonanno was being " released " by his captors so that he can now testify . Federal officials , according to reliable sources , are completely skeptical of the details given in the Winchell report . This divergence of views and the resulting animosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Southern District of New York , and Mr. Maloney , flared into the open yesterday afternoon . Mr. Maloney had telephoned Mr. Morgenthau to inform him that he had received the telephone call from Salvatore Bonanno , also known as Bill . Mr. Morgenthau asked Mr. Maloney to go at once to the Federal attorney 's office . " I 've got a roomful of reporters here , " Mr. Maloney said , his face flushing with anger . " I 'll come when I 'm finished here . By God , I wo n't come any sooner . I know my rights . If you do n't like it you can get a blankety-blank subpoena . " After he had hung up , he told the reporters , " I 'm damned burned up . He wants me to be there at 3:30 and it 's 3 o'clock now . I 'll go over there when I 'm ready . " I 'm very glad that my client is back and in. good health . Wa1pin Gerald *alpin , chief of the special prosecutions division has been questioning me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a hoax and I knew it was a hoax . I say flatly that it was not a hoax . " Questioned on Call When first questioned by reporters as to whether the call he had received from Salvatoreii Bonanno was a local call , 11. &; said , " I do n't see how you can tell whether a local call is a local call or not . " In talking to Mr. Morgenthau on the telephone later , Mr. Maloney said flatly that it was a local call . Later on the way to the United States Court House to meet with Mr. Morgenthau , Mr. Maloney said that after receiving a first call , he took note where the caller could be reached , then descended to the lobby of the building in which he practices law and called the number back . He said that he thought the number that he called back was that of a telephone booth and that it was a Murray Hill exchange . Mr. Maloney and Mr. Morgenthau finally met at 5:10 P.M. Mr. Walpin and Silvio J. Mollo , assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took part In the meeting . He promised that he would take Bonanno to appear before the grand jury at 10 A.M. on Monday . It was learned that the Government officials had been trying to tighten the net about Bonanno in recent days by deprivin , gehirn of his resources . A Federal tax lien against Salvatore Bonanno was filed on Thursday to tie up his ' assets in Phoenix because of money due on Federal income tax . A similar tax lien was to have been filed yeserday in Phoenix on the assets of Joe Bonanno .

' " As I started toward them another guy appeared and he also had a gun . The first one said in a loud , clear voice , ? Come on , Joe , my boss wants to see you . ' " The lawyer said that .
