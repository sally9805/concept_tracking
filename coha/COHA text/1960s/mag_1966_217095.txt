" I am Sukarno , the Great Leader of the Revolution , the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , " said the Great Leader of the Revolution to a crowd in Djakarta last week . " I am sick of the secret campaign against me . If you do not like me , I will resign , but do not do it in a secret manner . Who is against me ? Say so now . Those who agree with me and support me , stand by me . Defend me , build up your strength , because I now see efforts to topple me . " It was the second time in a week that he had said it . Did he know something ?
