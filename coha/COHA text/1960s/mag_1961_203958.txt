Sharply aware of the open penetration of Soviet Communism into the hemisphere through Castro 's Cuba , North and South Americans are now awakening to a more subtle infiltration from the Orient . Catching children 's eyes in bookstalls across Latin America are engaging editions of Spanish-language stories about happiness in Red China . Grownups can read more sophisticated magazines and drop in at 16 Red China-run " binational centers " set up in nine South American nations . They can tune to the powerful beam of Radio Peking , which recently jumped its broadcasts to 31 hours a day in Spanish and Portuguese . Or they can simply turn to their daily papers , spotted with news from the New China News Agency , which often operates alongside Fidel Castro 's mouthpiece Prensa Latina . <P> Look-Alikes . The clearest sign of growing Chinese influence appeared two months ago at the Red summit in Moscow , when a four-hour Chinese denunciation of Khrushchev 's coexistence policies drew its strongest support from the delegations from Cuba , Venezuela , Brazil , Argentina and Chile . The basis for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the increasingly industrialized Soviet Union bears little resemblance to underdeveloped , poverty-ridden Latin American nations . A much closer lookalike , Latin Americans are told persuasively , is Red China , land of the triumphant peasant revolutionary . <P> To put the point more emphatically , the Chinese Communists are paying for more and more trips to Red China by Latin American labor leaders , politicians and students . In 1958 the number of visitors was 165 ; in 1960 it was 470 . As soon as the tourist arrives he is greeted by his personal companion , guide and persuader . He is comfortably established in Peking 's Peace Hotel , filled with good food in one of the hotel 's two restaurants ( one European , one Chinese ) and then taken to hear the joyful songs of peasants toiling in the communes , to watch workers boosting norms in factories and marvel at pedestrians doing pre-dawn setting-up exercises in the streets . He travels from city to city ( each with its own special Peace Hotel ) listening to his highly sympathetic , " open-minded " guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Latin America 's . <P> Bonds of Pressure . The propaganda that the tourists absorb about " great leaps forward " is somewhat dissipated by what the visiting Latino can see . But there is no denying the peasantry , and the revolution , and at least a superficial resemblance to much of Latin America . <P> If just a little of the Red Chinese message sinks in , a small bond of sympathy is formed . And it is such subtle bonds , strengthened , restrengthened and converted into political pressure , that the Chinese Communists count on to bring them such trappings of respectability as admission to the United Nations .
