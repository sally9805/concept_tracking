SM8 Letters AID TO THE ARTS To THE EDITOR : Russell Lynes ' ohoice in " The Case Against Government Aid to the Arts " ( March 25 ) of the Laocoiin as an appropriate emblem of the violent constriction and agony of the arts that he envisages if the proposed Federal Advisory Council on the Arts comes into being leads one to imagine that the bill in question is not the " modest one " he concedes it to be , but a fateful initial step toward subjecting all visual and performing arts in the United States to control by the proposed twelve-man council and hence inevitably , since appropriations are involved , by the Congress. , The bill 's language , however , sets forth the policy that " the encouragement of the arts , while primarily a matter for private and local initiative , is an appropriate matter of concern to the United States Government . " By proposing that the council encourage private initiative and cooperate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' use and appreciation of the arts , it would subtract nothing from the country 's existing cultural activities , but on the contrary add to them . Though I share Mr. Lynes ' fear of ' regimentation of the arts and abhorrence of mediocrity , I believe that , as frequently happens , unbridled fear and abhorrence have led to misinterpretation of fact and misreading of symptom . This defeats the author 's aim , which I take to be the defense of freedom and excellence in the arts . That government subsidies do not invariably mean government control , lead to " creeping mediocrity , " nor permit a range only from " the right wing of the art world " to the " safe , sane and moderate " can be demonstrated by existing examples in which official subsidies have been used to supplement , not supplant , funds from other sources . We may cite the annual grants toward operating expenses received from city and county by the Albright-Knox Art Gallery , which houses its outstanding collection of contemporary art in a striking new modern building ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which regularly presents America 's foremost ballet corps and includes a number of innovations in its opera repertory . UNDERWRITING of certain basic operating costs by Federal , state or municipal institutions would actually make our cultural institutions freer than when their survival depends largely on box-office appeal ; for money from foundations or other private sources could then be applied to experimentation rather than to regular operations or bridging of annual deficits . Evidence that the Government , even when it acts as sole patron rather than merely granting aids in the form of subsidies , is capable of high quality and venturesomeness lies in the ' series of new em ( // Letters // , essies , designed by leading American architects and now being built abroad by the Foreign Buildings Operations of the State Department . Contrary to Mr. Lynes ' assertion that official art must reflect the Chief Executive 's own political preferences and artistic taste , this program has gone steadily forward since 1946 under Presidents Truman , Eisenhower and Kennedy . Why should the Federal Government not obtain expert advice to ensure that its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , posters , pamphlets and books , are as distinguished as these buildings in their design and execution ? By failing to establish and maintain high standards fox our official art , we do a disservice not only to art and artists , but to the Government itself , and the people of the United States . Should the proposed Federal Advisory Council help to replace our past indifference by a determination to raise our sights , this alone would be a signal achievement . RENE D'HARNONCOURT , Director , The Museum of Modern Art . New York . LOCAL OPTION TO THE EDITOR : C. Northcote Parkinson 's article on why in some countries they drive on the left side of the road ( " Because Horsemen Carried Lances , " April 1 ) may be intellectually appealing , but it fails to take into account the possibility , and indeed the fact , that most people in this civilized world have chosen to drive on the right . In Argentina , my home country , the story goes that a gaucho was riding in the Pampas , " facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city of Buenos Aires , touring the countryside , saw the strange sight and said to the gaucho , " Hey , there , you 're riding backwards ! " The horseman replied , " What makes you think that I want to ride any other way ? " BEN AMI GELIN . Philadelphia , Pa .. ON THE LEFT TO THE EDITOR : Apropos of Mr. Parkinson 's piece on driving to the left of the road , I might add that there is one portion of United States soil where Americans drive on the left : the Virgin Islands , U. S. A. It 's a holdover from Danish days . Some time after the United States acquired the Virgins in 1917 an attempt was made to Americanize the roads by switching traffic from left to right , but man was forced to bow to the Virgin Islands donkey who stubbornly refused to learn new road rules for a new regime . There were so many accidents , caused mainly by the donkeys ( the two-legged variety helped , too ) , that the whole idea was dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WALTER R. Wyss . Garden City , N. Y. MODERN GLADIATORS To THE EDITOR : . May I offer my compliments to Robert Payne on the excellent article on Roman gladiators ( " When the Romans Cried ' Jugula , ' " March 25 ) . I would wish , however , to take issue with him on one point . Mr. Payne says , " We can barely imagine the state of mind of the ancient Romans who amused themselves by watching the death agonies of gladiators . " Certainly we are less fond of blood for its own sake than our ancestors , but we are not purged of the thirst altogether . It can now take the form of " sport " and we avidly accept it and clamor for more . There may be no more gladiators with " a hundred thousand eyes " gazing at them , but their modern counterparts must face the equally heartless glare of the myriad lights . No gladiator need wait for the answer of the crowd , but his counterpart must still await the decision of the referee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an editor , but on the white towel of a manager . We no longer shout for a death , but if one occurs we turn for a moment in horror and return to see the next episode in man 's fight against man . CHRISTINA KOLBUSZWOSKI . Stratford . Conn . ' AND NOW A WORD . . ? TO THE EDITOR : Robert Saudek is-to be congratulated on his criticism of television programs for children . ( " Must It Be Kookie ' and ' Ka-Pow ' ? " March 25 . ) I think , however , that he left out an important aspect of the question , namely the commercials . To children , commercials are an integral part of the program , as they have not acquired the detachment of adults toward attempts to make them buy products . It is difficult enough to raise children under any circumstances , to control their demands for toys and sweets , to teach them the value of a wholesome diet . ? But through the course of a single day they are constantly prodded into asking  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are outrageously expensive , of poor quality and of no educational value other than reminding the children of a particular show ) , candy and soft drinks .
