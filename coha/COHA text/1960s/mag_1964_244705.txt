Waiting in the Garden for the President last week were officials from the National Forensic League who were resolved to make the President an honorary member . This was eminently fitting , for if Lyndon Johnson is n't the best forensicist around , he will do until a better one comes along . <P> For the Forensic officials , he had a little story . " I think the greatest disappointment that I ever experienced was not in being defeated in a political campaign , but in losing a state championship of Texas the first year that I coached debating . I always attributed the loss to the fact that I drew the wrong side of the subject instead of the right side . We had a subject : Resolved , that the jury system should be abolished . My team drew the affirmative , but the people were n't ready to abolish the jury system , although it was wavering for a while when my speakers were attacking it . When they brought in the votes , the first vote was affirmative , and that pleased me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was affirmative , the next one was negative , and there was a great deal of suspense there for a moment . The next vote was negative-and I got sick at my stomach . " <P> The Open Road . The President also delivered a rousing speech to a meeting of the Alliance for Progress ambassadors ( see THE HEMISPHERE ) , and buttonholed a group of businessmen on the subject of civil rights and equal employment . For the businessmen he had a joke , although its relevance was not quite clear . " I heard the story last night of a woman who telephoned her bank , " he said . " She wanted to arrange for the disposal of a $1,000 bond . The clerk asked her , ' Madam , is the bond for redemption or conversion ? ' There was a long pause , and the woman said , ' Well , am I talking to the First National Bank or the First Baptist Church ? ' " <P> To a visiting contingent of farm editors , the President had words of encouragement for the farming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminder that the farmers have one of their kind in the White House . " I never forget , " he recalled , " the road of opportunity . I have walked from my father 's tenant farmhouse , where I was born 56 years ago , to the White House , where I am today . I want to keep that road open for children today , whether they live on hard-rock farms along the Pedernales River , or whether they grow up on hard , concrete sidewalks . " Whereupon he invited the editors on a tour of his private quarters , exhibiting his green pajamas and dressing robe laid out on his bed , and Lady Bird 's own bed , without a spread on it . All the while , he rambled on , mostly about beef prices . " I 've got a good many more registered bulls than I can sell , " he complained . " I hate to be feeding them all year . " <P> Free Advice . And then he was out in the Garden again to present the William Randolph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newsmen.
