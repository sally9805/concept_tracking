That mythical magic of Bonnie and Clyde just will not fade . Now television is using them in a smartly satirical way . <P> TWA has a funny commercial that shows Bonnie , Clyde , C. W. Moss and the in-laws chugging along toward an airport in a 1931 Buick while frantic banjo music gives pace to the scene . Nobody likes to hang around an airport , says an urbane narrator-and so the bandits , every one the spit and image of the movie cast , scurry out of their car and make their way onto a TWA jet , leaving the cops behind . <P> Flying A gasoline sponsors another Bonnie and Clyde crew . This time they roll up to a Flying A station . They 're in a hurry ; they 've got a " withdrawal " to make . But the overfriendly attendant insists on delivering a pitch for the sponsor 's latest premium offer . Finally , a gum-snapping Bonnie says : " Let 's gedoutta heah awreddy ! " And off they lurch . <P> The latest addition to the literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercials . One shows Bonnie and Clyde in the hands of an effervescent dealer . The gang has just pulled a bank job and needs " something that moves . " The rest of the commercial is a hilarious takeoff on the scene from the movie in which the bandits kidnap a young couple . In this case , the unsuspecting Pontiac salesman merrily delivers his pitch-again to a banjo score-while Clyde &; Co. barrel down the road with him . At length , they boot him out . Says the salesman , unperturbed : " How are you going to finance it ? " Bonnie mutters sullenly : " Finance it , Clyde . " Clyde tosses out a satchel of money and drives off , while the salesman , ever the honest fellow , chases them into the fadeout , protesting valiantly that he has been overpaid . The possibilities are enormous . How about a scene that depicts Clyde brandishing a .46-caliber tommy gun . It 's only a silly millimeter wider .                @ @ @ @ @
