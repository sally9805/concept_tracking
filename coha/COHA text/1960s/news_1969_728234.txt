The Diocese of Brooklyn , which includes Queens and operates the nation 's third largest private school system , announced yesterday that tuition for the 16,000 students in its 10 high schools would rise from $300 to $600 beginning in the fall term of 1970 . A spokesman for the New York Archdiocese , which includes Manhattan , Staten Island , the Bronx and eight adjoining counties , said an announcement . of similar tuition increases for . the 49,617 students at its - 92 high schools was expected soon . Elementary , school tuitions in both dioceses , which officials at the financially hard-pressed schools also expect to increase , will be published later . The Brooklyn announcement , which was made in a letter to parents from the Rev. Franklin E. Fitzpatrick , superintendent ' of schools in the diocese was described by officials as a " maijor policy change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs . The New York Times The Rev. Franklin E. Fitzpatrick made announcement . The move was'thn latest sign of a serious financial crisis that has plagued parochial school ( systems across the country . Father Fitzpatrick . said the increase was necessitated . by the " deficit between tuition charged and the actual cost of educating children . " In the last two years , the ' Brooklyn diocese has lost $4:3-million Wis high school operations . ) - deficitof $3.5-million was expected this year . Until three years ago , the diocese , which is the nation 's only totally urban Catholic diocese was able to cover its school deficits through annual fundraising appeals that netted about $1-million a year . But the costs of the salaries of the growing number of lay teachers in the Catholic school system far exceeded the growth in tuition and donations . Over 50 per cent of Brooklyn 's more than 5,000 parochial school teachers are laymen . The rest belong to religious orders . The laymen receive $6,300 to $9,500 a year in salaries while the religious receive $1,800 to $2,400 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributed to the fact that fewer men and women enter religious orders and that there are a significant number of retirements and a consequent greater burden placed on those who remain . The figure first began to decrease about 10 years ago , church officials said . Laymen 's wages , which traditionally have been based on the scale negotiated between the city and the United Federation of Teachers , are expected to increase when contract negotiations now under way in both dioceses are completed . Msgr . Eugene J. Molloy , the Brooklyn Diocese 's secretary for education , said the announcement came yesterday because high school applications open next week . Applications for elementary school students are not due until May . Announcements of the new tuitions for the 180,000 students at the diocese 's 200 elementary schools will be made by individual parishes , he said . The present fees range from $50 to $100 a year , but officials predicted increases , although the exact sizes are not yet determined . Officials of the New York Archdiocese , where high school tuitions now range from $300 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high school tuitions were currently under study and would be announced soon . Tuition for 159,000 students in the archdiocese 's 329 elementary schools ranges from $50 to $100 . While unable to provide exact figures , officials acknowledged there was " very little doubt " that increases would be necessary next fall for both elementary and high school students . " The gap is just too large now for the parishes to make up the difference , " said Msgr . James Feeney , deputy superintendent of schools . " The salary negotiations in progress now will only put more pressure on our financial problems , " he added . Several officials in both dioceses expressed hope that some form of state aid would forestall further tuition increases . Some Governors have expressed interest in various forms of state aid to nonpublic schools as many Catholic students fleeing rising tuitions have transferred to public schools . In the last two years , it has been estimated , such an influx has cost taxpayers some $315-million with an added $100-million projected for this year . Recently , for example , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides $25-million for a three-year program in which nonpublic schools could receive up to 75 per cent of the estimated average salary paid to lay teachers . If this bill is passed by the Michigan House and signed by the Governor , Michigan would join Connecticut , Ohio , Rhode Island and Pennsylvania in giving direct financial aid to Catholic schools . New York States now provides Catholic schools with transportation , lunches , health services and the loan of textbooks .
