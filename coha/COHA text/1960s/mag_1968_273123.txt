Inventor Bert Adams demonstrated his new , nonrechargeable battery for the U.S. Army with understandable pride . Just as he claimed , it put out a steady current even in extreme heat or extreme cold . Worthless , said the military technicians . No , thank you . <P> Adams nonetheless patented his battery in 1943 . Then ten years later , the Army got a patent of its own-without a word to Adams-and ordered more than a million batteries built to its own design . Sure that he had been bilked , Bert went to court . Six other men , who had backed the invention , joined the suit . Not until 1966 did the U.S. Supreme Court rule that Bert 's patent had indeed been infringed . Last February the lawyers involved agreed that the Government should pay $2,500,000 in damages . <P> Painful Riders . Losers of damage suits are notoriously slow payers , and all too often the winner finds himself back in court fighting to collect what the law has said is rightfully his . But Adams ' debtor , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his pocket . <P> Far from it . Before the U.S. could settle , Congress had to appropriate the funds . A rider to that effect was at tached to an appropriations bill . Then another rider was attached , allocating funds for the Office of Economic Opportunity ; that sank the whole bill . In due course , Adams ' hopes were attached to another appropriations bill . But a request for highway funds was also added , and that bill was tabled . <P> Every Effort . A Congress notably wary of any kind of spending seemed utterly uninterested in the welfare of the retired inventor . Now 69 , he has been living in Yuma , Ariz. , primarily on social security payments . Then last month , in a surprising paroxysm of activity , Congress passed a bill appropriating his money . After paying his lawyer and splitting with his fellow plaintiffs , Adams and his wife received $517,442.92 . Said Bert : " It does n't mean a thing , really , except that it was right for it to come out this way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that money ? " <P> The Government has an idea . Tax it . <P> Bert and his lawyers are preparing to fight once more .
