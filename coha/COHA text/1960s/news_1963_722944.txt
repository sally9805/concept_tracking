txt Housewives in lands around the Caribbean increasingly are abandoning charcoal stoves to cook with Tropigasito . Tropigasito is a gas hotplate fueled by a white container of bottled gas about the size of a five-gallon water can . Tropical Gas Co. of Coral Gables , Fla. , markets both the hotplate and gas in 18 Latin countries . Last year sales quadrupled from a year before and this year they are expected to be double the 1962 level , according to Cullen Johnston , who has charge of the sales program . Tropigasito is but one of a number of recent triumphs of an intense market search by producers and marketers of liquefied petroleum gas , also called LPG or bottled gas . Some of the market finds have been big ones , such as the use of LPG flame by U.S. farmers to kill weeds and insects . Others are smaller . For instance , Prepo Corp. , Edgerton , Wis. , is marketing artificial candles fueled with a small gas cartridge and Perfection division of Hupp Corp . in Cleveland is going into production of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LPG Sometimes in Oversupply These efforts are spurred partly by necessity . LPG is s. by-product of natural gas and as natural gas production has risen , producers have had to scramble to find outlets for the LPG they extract . They often have had to contend with oversupply . Although oversupply sometimes brings distress to LPG producers , sales have been rising steadily since World War II . Last year 's record volume of 10.8 billion gallons was up 10% from a year before and industry sources predict a further 10% rise this year . Butane and propane are the two basic types of LPG ; the familiar pressure tanks seen outside rural and suburban homes usually contain propane . Cold or pressure will keep both materials in a liquid state . When pressure is relieved , liquid propane will " boil " back into gas , expanding in volume 250 times , if its temperature is above minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit . Butane wo n't boil unless the temperature is above freezing , making it less practical for home use . Most butane toes to make industrial chemicals used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas not served by gas pipelines is the biggest market for LPG . But others are growing . Most producers agree that " flame cultivation " offers one of the biggest potentials . Farmers go into their fields with LPG tanks on their tractors or on their backs and aim nozzles spurting gas flames at weeds and insects . The process is particularly useful when a crop 's roots are easily damaged by plowing or where hoeing is normally required because of difficulties in getting tractors through the fields . Sometimes farmers burn off young shoots so stronger growth will replace them . In another application , burning off the mature above-ground growth of potatoes hastens the ripening process much as a killing frost does . Equipment Sales Grow " Flame cultivation is just now coming into its own , " says Roy Smith , secretary and treasurer of Gotcher Engineering &; Manufacturing Co. , a large producer of flame equipment in Clarksdale , Miss . " We 're building 2,000 units in the year ending Sept. 30 and are prepared to raise that to 3,000 . " Last fiscal year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years before . Flame cultivation is being used on more than 15,000 farms , the National LP-Gas Council in Chicago estimates . That is more than a 50% gain from a year ago . High Plains Research Institute at Halfway , Tex. , is trying to extend the technique to more crops . At an experimental farm near San Benito , Tex. , it is testing flaming on 10 vegetable crops where it is not now used . High Plains Research says that it often costs $14 to $15 to weed cotton with a hoe ; flaming does the same job for $4 to $5 an acre . Farmers also are using LPG flame for such purposes as grain drying and tobacco curing . " The growth of flame cultivation and grain drying is helping us make up for some markets we 're losing as natural gas pipelines spread , " says W. A. Schuette , Midwest vice president for Petrolane Gas Service , Inc. , of Long Beach , Calif . " In Urbana , Ill. ; we lost 700,000 gallons a year to new gas lines , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " LPG producers and distributors are working to develop other new markets . Phillips Petroleum Corp. , Bartlesville , Okla. , plans to launch an overseas sales campaign . A special refrigerated tanker to carry LPG across the ocean is due for delivery in 1964 . " We think there 's a good potential in England and Europe , " says Frank DeVoe , manager of LPG sales . The LPG industry also is hopeful of finally boosting use of its product in internal combustion engines , where consumption has never lived up to early expectations . For a number of years LPG has powered a few taxi , truck and bus fleets . Because the gas burns cleanly , it reduces spark plug wear and the need for oil changes . However , some users have had trouble with inconsistent fuel quality . The head of a concrete company in Atlanta complains : " We tried burning propane in three trucks , but we lost 101. to 15% of our power . " At the beginning of the year the Natural Gas Processors Association , which represents about 75% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propane to be sold for motor vehicle use . This fuel will be known as HD-5 , and producers figure the assurance of consistent high quality will boost use . " The over-the-road truck market has great potential , but we do n't have 1% of it now , " says F. E. Pilling , vice president of the Marvel . Schleber Products division of Borg-Warner Corp. , which makes devices for converting gasoline engines to LPG . He predicts the company 's sales of conversion units will rise 30% this year over last . Conversion involves installing the LPG pressure , tanks and making carburetor and other engine changes . Oil and spark plug savings , plus the fact that LPG usually costs less per mile than gasoline , allows the $300 conversion cost to be recovered in about 25,000 miles of driving , Mr. Pilling says . LPG advocates hope to persuade engine makers to build engines tailored for LPG use if HD-5 proves more popular than older LPG fuels . LPG distributors are constantly losing home owner markets as gas pipelines forge into new a cas since natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are encouraging propane dealers to naive into new areas not yet served by gas mains to persuade home owners to invest in gas rather than electric appliances . In these " unity programs " the utility then pays the LPG distributor if the utility takes Over the customer later . Northern Illinois Gas Co. in Bellwood , Ill. , Is among utilities that make such payments to cooperating LPG dealers . If the customer has been using propane for space and water heating and for cooking , the LPG dealer gets 575 the first year the utility has the customer and lesser amounts the next two years , " We think its a great way to protect a new area for gas . " says George Lynch , sales manager for Northern Illinois Gas .
