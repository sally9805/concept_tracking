Most of the million visitors who crowd into Ocean City , Md. , each summer go there to rest , and for them miniature golf counts as a strenuous sport . But Ocean City also lures a hardier type : the sport fisherman . Hotel phone operators spot him easily : he is the fel low who asks to be called at 5 a.m. , and again at 5:30 , " just to make sure . " By 6:30 , he has gobbled down break fast , swallowed a Dramamine pill , and scoured the sleeping town for a six-pack of cold beer . Half an hour later , he is aboard a motorboat , headed for the Jack Spot , a ten-square-mile expanse of shoal water with one simple claim to fame : there , each summer , congregates the densest concentration of white marlin in the world . <P> Fish Out of Water . Compared with its giant kin , the Atlantic blue marlin and the black marlin , the white seems almost pygmyish . The biggest white mar lin ever boated weighed 161 lbs. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue and 1,560 lbs . for the black . But for fishermen who can not afford to chase the blues to the Bahamas or the blacks to Panama , the silvery , long-billed white marlin is a mettlesome substitute . Pound for pound , it is one of the sea 's most exciting and annoying game fish . Wily and wary , the white marlin will trail a trolling boat for miles , inspecting the bait , even tapping it tentatively with its bill , then turn tail and nonchalantly swim away , with curses raining down over its wake . Or it will grab the bait sideways in its jaws , neatly avoiding the hook , then spit it back into the water with what seems a shrug of disgust . Skilled fishermen sometimes try to trick a white marlin onto the hook by " racing " the bait ( skipping it swiftly along the surface ) , then suddenly dropping it backward as the openmouthed fish approaches . Even that tactic often fails . " Ai n't nothing in the ocean so hard to outguess as a marlin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've learned in 15 years is never to expect no favors from them . " <P> If it is hard to get a white marlin on the hook , it is even harder to keep it there . An angry white marlin can swim at 60 m.p.h . In its strong , tenacious struggle to throw the hook , it often thrusts out of the water 20 times or more in " tailwalking " jumps and long " greyhounding " leaps , sometimes lunges at the stern of a boat with enough force to impale a careless fisherman on its bill . <P> Flags on the Rigging . The white marlin 's poundage makes it a light-tackle fish by strict fishermanly standards , but charter-boat skippers usually load their reels with 50-lb. test line to give their clients a fighting chance . Even so , the big ones often get away . But there are days when everything goes right , when the marlins gobble every bait in sight , when the Jack Spot boils with leaping fish , and blue and white flags flutter gaily on the rigging of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
