( See Cover ) <P> Comrades , we live at a splendid time : Communism has become the invincible force of our century . The further successes of Communism depend to an enormous degree on our will , our unity , our foresight and resolve . Through their struggle and their labor , Communists , the working class , will attain the great goals of Communism on earth . Men of the future , Communists of the next generations , will envy us . <P> - Nikita Khrushchev , addressing party conference , Jan. 6 , 1961 <P> I think most of our people can not understand that we are actually at war . They need to hear shells . They are not psychologically prepared for the concept that you can have a war when you do n't have actual fighting . <P> - Admiral Hyman Rickover , addressing U.S. Senate Committee on Defense Preparedness , Jan. 6 , 1958 <P> The President of the U.S. leaned back in his overstuffed leather chair , propped his size-10 black Oxfords on a footrest , reached out his hand and sent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to a stop with his finger . leaned forward and squinted . In the week of Laos , John F. Kennedy was thoroughly aware of Khrushchev 's battle cry-and he did n't have to hear shells to believe that there is a war on . <P> The war , as President Kennedy sees it , is not likely to take the form of a big nuclear blowoff , although he intends to be prepared for one . The 19605. he thinks , will be an era of messy internal struggles where opposing sides are fed help and guidance by the two major world powers . " The struggle . " said he , " is changing . It 's not a question of troops marching across a frontier . We face the problems of having ' Spains ' all over in the next decade . Laos is an example-Viet Nam . the Congo . It is a question of subversion and paramilitary political techniques . The force of events in those areas will mean military and paramilitary struggles for the next decade . " <P> In walking into the decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Kennedy is not preoccupied with bombers , carriers or divisions for their own sake . But he is fond of the statement made in 1954 by General Walter Bedell Smith , then Under Secretary of State : " It will be well to remember that diplomacy has rarely been able to gain at the conference table what can not be gained or held on the battlefield . " Says the President : " I 'm interested in what our objectives are , not the military struggle . " Despite the setbacks in his first major crisis , he has determined on one single-minded answer to the single-minded challenge he reads into Nikita Khrushchev : the U.S. must win the cold war . <P> Fusion . In the 14 years of this global war it never wanted , the U.S. has used a number of key words to explain its defense philosophy : containment , deterrence , massive retaliation , balance of terror , limited war , etc . But somehow it has given short shrift to the key word " win . " The omission was strange , for if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than winning would serve as a defense philosophy against the Soviets ' clear declaration of undeclared war .
