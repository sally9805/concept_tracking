It was the 21st annual convention of the National Association of Evangelicals , and to many it appeared that the association was coming of age . Founded in 1942 by conservative Protestants who objected to liberal tendencies in the old Federal Council of Churches , the association has sometimes seemed to be the great dissenter of U.S. Christianity . In past conventions , delegates hurled mighty anathemas at their list of enemies of the Gospel-liberal Protestants , Godless Communists , Roman Catholics eager for political influence . " But now we have a position . " observes the Rev. Stan Mooneyham of Wheaton , 111 . " We are no longer reacting . " <P> Gathering in Buffalo , the delegates , representing about 2,000,000 Protestants in 40 denominations ranging from Assemblies of God through Evangelical Mennonites to Free Will Baptists , seemed to be more for than against . Although conservative Protestants generally prefer to see the wall between church and state kept high , the association this year issued a surprisingly moderate statement . It resolved that Christians are " citizens of two cities " who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to the state . These two aspects may overlap but they do not coincide . Neither are they properly considered in conflict . " The Evangelicals reaffirmed their opposition to Communism but warned Christians against making it " the church 's sole or main enemy . " Another resolution called upon the churches not to withdraw from a wicked world , but to " penetrate culture . " Christians , the statement urged , should dedicate themselves to applying the Biblical principles which promote " social justice and enduring peace . " <P> The association 's new lessened militancy has caused speculation that it might consider a merger with either the ecumenical-minded National Council of Churches , to its left , or the fundamentalist American Council of Churches , to its right . President Robert A. Cook , of Briarcliff Manor , N.Y. , put a quick stop to such talk . " The National Association of Evangelicals , " he said , " does not propose to take either the course of accommodation , represented by the ecumenical movement , or the course of reaction , represented by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremes .
