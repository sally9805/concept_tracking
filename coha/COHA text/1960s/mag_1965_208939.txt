" All that men are willing to die for , beyond self-interest , tends more or less obscurely to justify that fate by giving it a foundation in dignity : Christianity for the slave , the nation for the citizen , Communism for the worker . " <P> So broods a character in Andr Malraux 's Man 's Fate , undoubtedly reflecting the author 's own vision in the 1920s when he spent two years in Canton as propaganda commissar for the Kuomintang , which was then an alliance that included the Communists . Last week , for the first time in 40 years , Malraux was back in China as guest of the Red leaders who achieved the revolution Malraux worked for as a young man . Too individualistic ever to join the party , Malraux 's own disillusion with Communism came with the Nazi-Soviet pact , and he has since embraced a narrower creed : Gaullism . <P> <P> Jumped Ship . Yet Malraux 's return to his old haunts was almost as devious and shrouded in mystery as any of his assignments as a revolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Minister of Cultural Affairs on doctor 's orders to take a long , relaxing sea voyage . He boarded the steamer Le Cambodge , and his destination was Japan . But , at Singapore , he left the ship , caught a plane to Hong Kong . Next thing anyone knew , he was in Canton , asking to see the Whampoa Military Academy , where he had an office in 1925-26 . <P> <P> From Canton , Malraux went on to Peking and spent four days browsing in antique shops and visiting the Imperial Palace and the Temple of Heaven . There was also a three-hour chat with China 's Foreign Minister Chen Yi ; Malraux blandly called it a tour d'horizon that included cultural relations between the two countries . Next , the visitor was off to see the Lung-men Grottoes near Loyang , the archaeological finds at Sian , and finally , the cave-riddled mountains of Yenan where Mao Tse-tung set up his headquarters after the 6,000-mile Long March . <P> Red Ladder . On his return to Peking , Malraux had a long talk with Premier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Chen Yi tossed flowers at each other . Of Red China and France , Malraux said , " It 's true that our social systems are different . It is also true that both of us have had to battle against a powerful aggressor who , weapons in hand , came to fight in a place where he should n't have been . " Malraux may have meant Japan 's invasion of China , but Peking was free to interpret his words as meaning the U.S. in Korea . <P> <P> After the banquet came a three-hour visit with Party Chairman Mao Tse-tung and President Liu Shao-chi . Malraux suddenly produced a letter for Mao from Charles de Gaulle . In Paris no one would say whether the letter was in Malraux 's pocket when he left , or had reached him in Peking after he had advised the French embassy that things were going well . <P> Malraux did not clarify matters very much when he finally surfaced in Hong Kong last week . Shrugging away questions about his mission , he allowed that France hoped to sponsor a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his trip than that ? Well , he had conferred with Mao Tse-tung on " the most important problems of our time , and it was obvious that Chairman Mao had as complete mastery of the situation as ever in his entire life .
