The chief of state decided that the past must he wiped out . He ordered all philosophical books burned , except for one copy to be preserved in the state library . Many scholars were denounced as economically useless . By contrast , the masses of disciplined peasants and workers were exalted . The state took over control of religion . When intellectuals protested , thousands were condemned to forced labor . <P> A partial account of Mao Tse-tung 's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution ? Not at all . The Chinese ruler who acted thus was called Shih Huang Ti , the Emperor famed for constructing the Great Wall . In the 3rd century B.C. , he forcibly united most of China around the northeastern state of Ch'in and established a tyrannical rule that was soon swept away in civil war . It would be risky to draw any neat lessons from this parallel between past and present . Perhaps the only sure thing to be concluded is that nothing in the world 's oldest continuing civilization is wholly new . <P> Every country is not only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has haunted-and usually eluded-the Western mind ever since travelers set out to find the dream of golden-roofed Cathay . In the Renaissance , Matteo Ricci , the Italian Jesuit who reported on China under the Ming dynasty , praised the country 's " orderly management of the entire realm . " In the Age of Reason , Leibniz suggested that what Europe needed was Chinese missionaries to teach " goodness . " In the Victorian era , the U.S. Protestant missionary Arthur H. Smith was shocked by China 's " indifference to suffering . " The Chinese seemed sober , industrious , cheerful , polite and stoical . But they also seemed superstitious , hostile , unimaginative , politically passive , and arrogant toward those not blessed by Chinese birth . <P> Many of the apparent contradictions are caused by one basic difference between the West and China . Western man , in the image of Prometheus or Faust , seeks to dominate nature ; the Chinese seeks to live in harmony with it . The ideal of harmony-with the universe , with the past , within society-helps to explain China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subordination of the individual to the overall design . Above all , it helps to account for the periodic outbursts of violence in a land that values nonviolence . When society is repressed , when forms are meticulously observed , when balance is sought above all , sooner or later the strain can become too much . The reaction is then apt to be more violent than in a society that is psychologically accustomed to struggle , and considers it a law of life . <P> The apparent serenity of China has often hidden the recurring tensions between central government and regions , between Emperor and officialdom or ambitious war lords-and , above all , the sometimes intolerable inner tensions of trying to maintain harmony . As China Scholar Etienne Balazs put it : " The smiling landscape is found to be a veil which , when torn asunder , reveals a craggy vista of precipices and extinct volcanoes , reminiscent of the visions with which most Chinese landscape painters were obsessed .
