How does a President worship ? Unnoticed by his aides and security guards , Harry S. Truman once slipped away to services at a church near the White House , but he was probably the last Chief Executive who would do so . Dwight Eisenhower went regularly to the National Presbyterian Church ; since the murder of John Kennedy , the Secret Service has frowned on that because of the predictable pattern it could create for potential assassins . The freewheeling , ecumenical church-hopping of Lyndon Johnson created a different kind of security problem , as well as a weekly show . Richard Nixon has resolved the situation by holding Sunday religious services in the White House itself . <P> The idea was the President 's own . It began with his request to Billy Graham , a longtime friend , to conduct informal prayers there shortly after the Inauguration . Since then , there have been seven other Sunday services in the East Room . The enthusiastic response from invited religious leaders and the usual crowd of 280 or so high-ranking guests has made the ecumenical worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> " Little Gems . " Nixon is not the first President to have religious observances in the White House . Evangelist Graham conducted a service for Lyndon Johnson and 75 guests last summer . But Nixon is the first to hold services regularly . Among the White House preachers since Graham have been the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York , Terence Cardinal Cooke , Rabbi Louis Finkelstein , chancellor of New York 's Jewish Theological Seminary , Dr. Norman Vincent Peale of Manhattan 's Marble Collegiate Church , and Dr. R. H. Edwin Espy , general secretary of the National Council of Churches . <P> Despite the different faiths of the presiding clergymen , the half-hour service is recognizably Protestant in style . It usually begins with a Christian doxology and a short prayer , followed by a hymn - such solid traditional fare as Faith of Our Fathers or O God , Our Help in Ages Past-led by a visiting choir . The sermons , about twelve minutes long , are usually extemporaneous . Pat Nixon calls them " little gems " and plans to privately publish a collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and adjournment to the State Dining Room for coffee and sweet rolls . <P> The Christian flavor of the services was maintained even during the visit two Sundays ago of Rabbi Finkelstein and a number of Jewish guests . Though Finkelstein intoned a Jewish hymn , Adon Olam , at the end of the service , the Lutheran guest choir sang a traditional doxology , Praise God , From Whom All Blessings Flow-a hymn that specifically glorifies the Trinity . Although some eyebrows were raised , Nixon aides explained that this particular hymn was always part of the services , and Rabbi Finkelstein confirmed that he had been informed of it in advance . Finkelstein acknowledged that he " did not exactly jump for joy " at the idea , but considered it the President 's prerogative . " After all , " he said , " it 's his house . I did not hear a word of criticism from anybody . "
