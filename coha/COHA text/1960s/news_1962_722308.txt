txt Letters to The Times v. 20 Letters to The Times Testing Discussed Problem of Rent Control Readers Give Views on President 's " Sleeper " Amendment Characterized as Unsound Step Decision to Resume TOME EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Possibly it is true , as some of those who advocate resumption of nuclear tests claim , that a failure to resume nuclear tests would not in itself bring the arms race to a halt . So long as vast quantities of nuclear weapons remain in the stockpiles of the United States and the U. S. S. R. , and so long ins we continue the acceleration of our missile technology , the arms race will continue its deadly and dangerous course whether we resume testing or not . But if we resume testing it will be that much more difficult ever to bring ourselves to dismantle our nuclear stockpiles or transform our space experiments to purely peaceful uses . The resumption of nuclear tests opens a new era of horror and despair which unless it is halted soon after it had begun would add to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward final disaster . When governments must rely on such devices to retain confidence among the people and the other nations of the world , the real bases of public confidence disappear . STEWART MEAC RANI , Peace Education Secretary , American Friends Service Committee . Philadelphia , March 2 , 1962 . Warning the Soviets To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : From President Kennedy 's statement concerning the resumption of atmospheric nuclear testing I can only assume that either the Russians are now ahead of us in nuclear warfare technology dr that our move is merely a show of strength . If neither of the above assump. tions is correct , why do n't we announce to the world that we arc preparing for a massive series ol atmospheric tests to be carried out only if the Russians begin another series of tests ? Atmospheric blasts are easy to detect , and it is to be hoped that the Russians can learn no mom from underground explosions thar we can . DAVID DE NEUFVILLE . Ithaca , N. Y. , March 5 , 1962 . Uniting Behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIDIES : The decision to test has now beer made . The choice has passed out of our hands . We Americans have no alternative but to unite behind our President in his fateful signa : to resume atmospheric testing . He has made America 's independence and the lives of millions of people in the free world paramount . We quarrel with that decision and hit reasons for the decision at our peril We must stand resolute , courageous , knowing that now peace " can not be brought nearer by real or apparent weakness . " Only our calm and determined strength through prayer will save the world , T. CARTER DODD . Stamford , Conn. , March 4 , 1962 . Inconsistent Position Charged To THE EDITOR OF T II ENEW YORK TIMES : Does not our decision to resume atmospheric testing raise a problem of inconsistency , or at least incongruity , with our previous position at Geneva on the detection of underground testing ? At Geneva we insisted on foolproof and stringent safeguards against underground testing , laying great stress on the likelihood of our national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now it seems that atmospheric testing is necessary for various technical reasons , and testing in laboratories and caves can not advance nuclear weaponry to the extent we desire . If thus compelled to test now , however , was not our previous insistence on ( unattainable ? ) absolute safeguards against underground testing a case of tragically misplaced emphasis ? MARVIN E. ROZEN . State College , Pa. , March 5 , 1962 . Christians and Test Resumption TO THE EDITOR OFT HE NEW YORK TIMES : The 750 million professing Christians of the world had better support President Kennedy 's drive to achieve world-wide agreement upon effective control and inspection of nuclear weapons or else , with the blasphemous testing of atomic bombs on Christmas Island at Easter time , abandon the hypocrisy of holding unconcerned religious services in Christian churches . JOHN KIIANLIAN . Eastchester , N. Y , , March 2 , 1962 . TO TII E EDITOR OF T HE NEW YORK TIMES : I most certainly take issue with the statements made by Ralph C. Gross of Commerce and Industry Association in his letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City , The " sleeper " amendment , the gateway to so many unwarranted rent increases , was not called to anyone 's attention , nor was its purpose explained by anyone . It was exactly what . it was subsequently characterized to be , " a sleeper . " In the debate on extension of rent control on the closing night of last year 's legislative session , I was the only member of the Senate who recognized and called attention to this amendment changing the equalization period from 1954 to the current year . I then stated that this would open the door for many more " hardship " increases . Despite my awareness , I was conservative in my charge because I could not anticipate the change in equalization rates which was subsequently adopted by the State Board of Equalization and Assess . ment , No one was able to visualize the full extent of the impact that this " sleeper " would cause . Had the effects been realized , this provision would not have been contained in the Rent Control Extension . The amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illogical in principle and violative of the original intent of the rent law , so far as guaranteeing landlords a fair return on investments . Effect on Landlords No one quarrels with the basic economic precept that every business is entitled to a profit and a fair rate of return . This applies as well to landlords , and rightfully so . However , the effect of this " sleeper " amendment was to give many landlords a much greater return on investments than the formula of 6 per cent plus 2 per cent for depreciation . This amendment suddenly placed many landlords already earning a fair return under the then existing formula in a position where they could suddenly and without any additional investment apply for and receive increases in rent . The Legislature was not right in enacting this " sleeper " clause . This was conclusively established when the Governor , for the sake of political expediency in the heat of the last Mayoralty campaign , proclaimed a " freeze " on all such increases , which " freeze " is still in effect . Had this not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a deluge of rent increases . ABRAHAM BERNSTEIN ? Member New York State Senate , Twenty-eighth District , Bronx . Albany , Feb. 28 , 1962 . Our Linguistic Standards Toms EDITOR I : ' TM NEW YORK TIMES : Brooks Atkinson 's survey of the Webster 's Dictionary controversy finalizes a vague despair that has been hatching in me for a long time . He writes good , like a critic should . Chaucer has his Parson ask " That if gold ruste , what shal iren doo ? " If those who know better are going to show cultural obtuseness by tolerating shabby language , what can he expected of the rest of us ? " Finalized " and the rest are manifestations of a vast complex of mediocrity that also has in its web such phenomena as adult Westerners , Hollywood , the twist and so on . It seems preposterous that a slogan " created " by someone more interested in sales than in syntax should be regarded as " acceptable English " simply because it communicates a " corporate image . " We do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruption , even though a great many people are addicted to them . Words are not cigarettes , and there is no reason to " buy " them simply because they are forced on us by those lacking verbal sensitivity . William Carlos Williams wrote his brilliant " Paterson " " in a search for the redeeming language by which a man 's premature death . . . might have been prevented . " This quest continues in earnest . There has never been a time when exact communication is more urgently needed . Loosening , rather than tightening Up our linguistic standards , can lead only to chaos . JOEL 0 . CONARROE , New York , March 1 , 1962 . Retired Engine 's Resting Place To THE EDITOR or THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your interesting article on Engine 999 ( Topics of March 3 ) should have mentioned the fact that this famous engine ( and others as well ) are now in the Railway Museum Park on River Road in Louisville , Ky. , where they may be seen free of charge .
