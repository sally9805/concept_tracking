In the good old Front Page tradition , Chicago is probably the most competitive newspaper town in the U.S. Four daily newspapers , owned by two companies , still battle for news beats and circulation , advertising and impact . In the morning , the late Colonel Robert R. McCormick 's Chicago Tribune stands grandly against the up-and-coming Sun-Times of the late Marshall Field . In the afternoon , the McCormick forces are represented briskly by the ex-Hearst Chicago 's American ; Field Enterprises publish the once-great Daily News . <P> Lately , an ominous note has crept into the competition . In the past , the fight was for larger circulation gains ; now much of the struggle is just to keep from losing readers . Looming is the sort of crisis that has overtaken almost every other U.S. city and reduced the number of dailies to one in the morning and one in the afternoon . <P> Coming Closest . Over the past six years , Chicago 's papers have suffered a combined daily circulation loss of 115,892 . The Tribune 's circulation has dropped more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 464,221 . The American has declined by a fraction to 443,761 , though it has gained 9,605 since 1965 . But in the past two years , the Sun-Times has forged ahead with an increase of 13,583 , bringing its circulation to 548,162 . Although both morning dailies are making money , it is estimated that the afternoon papers are losing a combined total of $8,000,000 a year . That loss is bound to grow as production costs continue to escalate and the papers pour more money into the fight . <P> The tabloid Sun-Times does not at tempt to carry as much news as the Trib , but what it does run is sharply written and attractively and conveniently presented . Directed at readers younger than the Trib 's , the Sun-Times pro jects more of a personality , and Editor Emmett Dedmon 's reporters are better known around town . The paper 's onceover-lightly treatment of the news appeals to commuters riding buses into the city as well as to Chicago 's growing Negro population . " The Sun-Times , " says a onetime Chicago editor , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has an identity , something that 's harder to find in other Chicago newspapers . " <P> The Trib , on the other hand , is proud of its tradition , thank you . Editor Don Maxwell , 67 , was handpicked for his job by the late Colonel McCormick . Maxwell , in turn , has hand-picked his successor , Managing Editor Clayton Kirkpatrick , 52 . " The Tribune is what it is today , " says Maxwell , " because we have a tradition . Editor Joseph Medill instructed the directors of the Tribune in his will : ' I hope you will always be able to remain Republican but always show good sense . ' I do n't think the Tribune will ever become flighty . Not so long as I am here . Not when Kirk takes over . " The Trib has , however , added a sprightly fashion section called " Feminique , " and in September will jointly publish a new book section with the Washington Post . Its Sunday magazine is becoming politically venturesome and occasionally thoughtful . " That magazine frightens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
