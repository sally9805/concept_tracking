Washington has watched with in creasing apprehension lately as a series of litt'e price increases has crept across the U.S. economy . Businessmen have wondered just how lonq Lyndon John son would let this inflationary trend proceed unchallenged , even if attacking it would mean some cost to the good will that he has built up among them . <P> Last week they got their answer - but in a manner so indirect and ambiguous that it took the nation a week to fathom what the President 's real feelings and intentions were . Convinced that one of John Kennedy 's greatest mistakes as President was his bitter , demagogic con frontation with the steel industry , John son managed to show his strong dis approval of price rises without uttering a single word in public . <P> Tales of Temper . It all began when Olin Mathieson , Reynolds Metals and Kaiser Aluminum announced plans to raise prices of primary aluminum about 2% , from 241 to 250 per Ib . Two days later , the Texas White House quiet ly posted a notice that White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Defense 's Robert McNamara , Treas ury 's Henry Fowler , Commerce 's John Connor ) to consider ways of selling part of the Government 's huge aluminum stockpile . Though the notice said nothing about prices , the New York Times , acting on information from the Administration , headlined a story linking the two events . It quoted " Administration sources " as saying that Lyndon Johnson was " sputtering mad , " intimated that the surplus sale-which presumably would weaken aluminum prices-was a reprisal against the industry for its price hike . <P> Taking up the scent , other newspapers elaborated on the theme ; soon , Administration sources were quoted describing Johnson as " foaming at the mouth . " Disturbed by this overdrawn image , the Texas White House began issuing denials . The President 's temper , said his aides , was quite cool . The stockpile meeting , announced Press Secretary Bill Moyers , was one of a series that had begun in January with industry representatives to seek a long-range plan to dispose of surplus aluminum . <P> At week 's end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producer , announced that it would go along with the price rises ( which left the metal selling for 10 per Ib. below its 1960 peak ) . That move , flagrantly ignoring Johnson 's veiled warning , brought the Administration into the open . At a press conference in Wash ington , called at Johnson 's specific command , Economic Adviser Gardner Ackley , Defense 's McNamara and Treasury 's Fowler declared that the alumi num price rises " have no justification under the wage-price guideposts and therefore are inflationary . " Though he denied that the decision had anything to do with aluminum price rises , McNamara announced that the Government will sell 200,000 tons of surplus alumi- num at market prices in 1966 , allowed that the sale is " bound to relieve some of the pressure on prices .
