The red carpet , band and phalanx of diplomats assembled at Rawalpindi 's sun-splashed airport were in honor of a foreign visitor , but most of the crowd had come to see the host . Pakistani President Ayub Khan , 60 , was making his first appearance in public since he suffered a complicated case of pneumonia three months ago . Thinner , but waving vigorously , he got on with his mission : to welcome Aleksei Kosygin , the first Russian Premier ever to visit Pakistan . <P> Even Kosygin accorded center stage to his recuperating host . After reading a bland opening statement , he turned and asked : " Did I do all right ? " Replied Ayub : " Well done , sir ! " <P> Ayub hoped that Kosygin would do considerably better in private . His aim was to persuade Kosygin to stop selling SU-7 bombers , submarines and ground-to-air missiles to India , or else start selling them to him . Cut off from most new weaponry since the five-week border war with India in 1965 , except for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance of subcontinental power is tilting in favor of India-and remains unconvinced by Russia 's claim that India 's arsenal is only for use against Red Chinese invaders . Furthermore , Pakistan wants the Soviets to lift their U.N . Security Council veto on discussion of Kashmir , the disputed Indian-held state of largely Moslem complexion . Ayub wants to settle its status by plebiscite , demands at least that the subject of Kashmir head any new Indo-Pakistani negotiations . <P> Not Eye to Eye . After two days of talks , Kosygin made it clear in a televised press conference that he and Ayub did not see eye to eye . " We might not be able , " he said , " to meet each other all the way on all points , and perhaps can not say that we have completely identical views on all the events going on . " Unfortunately for Ayub , Kosygin is not willing to risk alienating India , an ally against the Chinese that Russia wants to pamper with every attention . At week 's end he planned a detour to New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Viet Nam war . <P> Ayub did , however , win some handsome consolation prizes . Kosygin agreed to bankroll Pakistan 's first steel mill , a $100 million project in Kalabagh with a capacity of up to a million tons a year . He also offered to provide help on a nuclear power plant at Ruppur in East Pakistan , a radio hookup between Pakistan and Russia , and a fishery development . Most of them planned for completion after 1970 , these projects should provide a big boost for Pakistan 's next five-year plan , which begins that year . The present one , even though slowed down by the war with India and a two-year drought , is producing very close to the target of a 6.5%-per-year growth in the overall economy . Agriculture is even overperforming : Ayub 's dream of having Pakistan become a self-sufficient grain producer should be realized next year , a year ahead of schedule .
