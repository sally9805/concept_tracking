The problem of Careers Today magazine was not money but response . Editor in Chief Nicolas H. Charney and Publisher John J. Veronis lavished more than enough on production costs and advertising . Although it had promised more , the magazine never developed into much more than a job hunter 's guide on slick paper . Subscribers were so few that they cost more than they were worth . Last week , after four issues , Careers Today folded . Its demise was not , of course , the end of Charney and Veronis ( TIME , Feb. 14 ) , who will continue to publish the successful Psychology Today .
