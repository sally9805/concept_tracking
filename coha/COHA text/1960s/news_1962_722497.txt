txt The House of Representatives voted today to raise the national debt limit to $308,000,000,000 the highest level on record . Passage of the bill for an $8,000,000,000 increase came on a roll-call vote of 211 to 192 . The action capped a two-day debate that produced some of the session 's most sharply partisan exchanges . Republicans seized the occasion to make a concerted attack on the Kennedy Administration 's fiscal policies . They lined up almost solidly against the measure on the final vote . Aim of the Republicans Their obvious aim in the debate and voting was to dramatize what they called the ever-rising trend of Federal spending and to convict the Administration of fiscal irresponsibility . President Kennedy , at his news conference this afternoon , cited the party-line vote in giving examples of how the Democrats met " their responsibilities " and how the Republicans failed to do so . Question 11 , Page 10 . On passage , only nine Republicans supported the bill . Of the Democrats , 202 voted for the measure and 39 against it . Also voting " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The President charged the Republican opponents with voting for a course that would have made it possible only with " great difficulty " for the Government to meet its commitments to pay veterans ' benefits , national defense costs and other obligations fixed by law . He recalled that President Eisenhower had proposed an increase in the debt limit nearly every year during his Republican Administration and had received Democratic cooperation . The President said that he himself as a Senator had supported General Eisenhower on the question " every time . " President Kennedy also replied to charges of Kennedy made by Republicans during yesterday 's House debate . The Republican complaint was that defense contractors had been warning Representatives at the Defense Department 's instigation that Federal contracts in the legislators ' home districts might have to be cut back if the bill failed . The President said he hoped it had been explained " to everyone " that the Government would be unable to pay its bills if the debt limit were not ? increased . Question 20 . The Congressmen " were only being informed of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the measure fol lowed the rejection of a Re publican ' move to put a $306 , 000,000,000 limit on the debt The vote was 258 to 145 . Foul Democrats and 141 Republican : supported the move . Twenty . one Republicans and 237 Dem . ocrats voted against it . Senate Fight Foreseen The bill now goes to the Senate , where it faces further trouble in the Finance Committee . Senator Harry F. Byrd , Democrat of Virginia and a leading critic of Administration fiscal policies , is the committee chairman . He has served notice of a fight to hold any increase in the debt limit to a lower figure . Congress has been raising the limit almost annually and with little comparative fuss since the start of the " cold war . " Ordinarily , the bills do not prompt much partisan strife because most legislators regard the limit more as a symbol of the Government 's fiscal position than as an effective curb on Federal spending . The reasoning is that when the time comes to raise the limit it is too late for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has already created the need for additional borrowing by appropriating more money than it raises through taxes . ? The pending increase was sought by the Administration to allow for seasonal fluctuations in the national debt during the 1963 fiscal year , which starts July 1 . The debt is now above $299 , - 000,000,000 and because of sea ' sonally lean tax collections in , the next six months is expected to rise to more than $304,000 , - 000,000 . Debt Could Be Cut If the balanced budget projected by President Kennedy for the 1963 fiscal year is realized  --  a ? prospect that now seems unlikely  --  heavy tax collections from January on would reduce the debt to less than $300,000 , - 000,000 by June 30 , 1963 , the end of the fiscal year . The bill passed today sets $308,000,000,000 as the limit fox the first nine months of the fis ? cal year and lowers it in two steps to $300,000,000,000 at the end of the twelve-month period                @ @ @ @ @
