Rerun season , a bane to the regular viewer but a boon to the occasional one , is in full flower on the networks . Most of the weekly series now contract for only 26 new episodes a year , which leaves the other six months to be filled with repeats of segments shown earlier in the season or from years past . It 's a happy time for those who love The Man from U.N.C.L.E . and baseball with equal fervor , less so for those who suspect that the episode they missed last fall was n't worth watching in the first place .
