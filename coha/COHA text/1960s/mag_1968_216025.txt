Of R.F.K. , N.R.A . &; TV <P> Sir : I doubt that anyone who does not own a gun can be any more outraged at the tragic assassination of Senator Kennedy than are the many responsible citizens who happen to be sportsmen and gun owners June 21 . I have seen firearms used for good ( yes , even against fellow man ) , as well as for evil ; but I have not as yet laid blame ( or credit ) to the gun . It is interesting to ponder if the emotion of the moment will bring on a joust with windmills , and whether the result will provide a catharsis for the guilt complex of a nation in turmoil . <P> JOHN V. POTTER JR . White Sulphur Springs , Mont . <P> Sir : I fully agree with the National Rifle Association 's stand that gun laws will not stop people from shooting people . I would also like to see the American Automobile Association campaign to eliminate all traffic laws , because they do not stop people from speeding and driving through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some interested group work to eliminate laws against rape . There are always some killjoys in society trying to restrain the American sportsman . <P> B. BLATTERFEIN Elmhurst , N.Y . <P> Sir : The right of an honest American to own a firearm for self-defense , oldest of all human rights , is more important than the life of any leader who ever lived . <P> C. H. HAUSER Oklahoma City <P> Sir : Some of my fellow N.R.A . members might change their minds about our frightfully inadequate gun laws if they spent a few days watching the " weekend warriors " being brought into Temple 's accident dispensary , also known as the Tioga Knife and Gun Club . If you really want to see the lead fly , go to the Poconos on the opening day of deer season ; it makes the Tet offensive look like kid stuff . <P> KENNETH I. BIRD JR. , M.D. Temple University Hospital Philadelphia <P> Sir : Hasty , hysterical legislation only promises to leave the law-abiding American more exposed to the armed criminal and addict . We already have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatically prevent crimes . Trained gun owners are the answer to the gun problem . <P> RAYMOND BROWNE Waccabuc . N.Y . <P> <P> Sir : In TIME 'S review of my current novel Airport March 22 , a criticism was made that a description of how to build a homemade bomb was needlessly specific . I consider this criticism justified . As a result , in later U.S. and overseas editions of the book , I have fuzzed the bomb description , making it impossible to follow by specific steps . <P> I now suggest that TIME take its own advice and in future black out details of how to buy firearms such as those displayed ( address and all ) in the reproduced advertisement . <P> ARTHUR HAILEY London <P> Sir : These past weeks , I have reviewed with horror and disgust my own inflammatory , biased and ill-considered remarks about the candidates , their policies , their motives and even their wives . What , indeed , had I to do with this latest paroxysm of violence ? What can I possibly do to prevent another ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have preconceived opinions to lay aside , and harsh , irresponsible words to swallow . <P> J. PATRICIA BETHANY Riverton , N.J.
