txt Leonard Bernstein will not return as music director of the New York Philharmonic when his current contract expires in the spring of 1969 . The conductor intends to concentrate on composing . Mr. Bernstein 's decision , considered to be the most important one affecting New York orchestral life since Arturo Toscanini retired from conducting in 1954 , was announced at a news conference held yesterday at Philharmonic Hall . Amyas Ames , president of the Philharmonic , said that Mr. Bernstein would continue to be associated with the orchestra as " laureate conductor , " a post and title created especially for him . In that capacity , he will conduct for a number of weeks during the regular season and will continue to participate in recording and television activities , particularly the Young People 's Concerts . Mr. Ames said that the Philharmonic 's biggest task now was " to search the world " for the best possible successor to Mr. Bernstein . He would not name any candidates but noted that " we have a lot of exciting ideas . " No deadline was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked if he would be an American , Mr. Ames said , " We 've got one of the finest Americans now , and we would like him to be , but there are no limitations . " Mr. Bernstein , who was present , said : " A time is arriving in my life when I must concentrate maximally on composing , and this can- not be done while retaining the great responsibilities inherent in the Philharmonic post , which is a full-time commitment , and indeed , more than that . " The conductor said he also hopes to have greater scope for his occasional conducting activities . " In the past I 've had very little opportunity to conduct opera at all , " he asserted . But his main interest will be in composing , Mr. Bernstein stressed . " I would like to take up from where I left off with ' West Side Story . ' If I had n't spent the time conducting , perhaps by now I would have evolved some kind of musicaltheater form that I could be proud of . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Conductor Is ' Grateful ' The conductor said that he was very happy about his laureate post . " I am infinitely grateful that the Philharmonic is making my severance so joyful . It is increasing my relationship with the Philharmonic to a lifelong one , and it makes me very happy because I have a lifelong feeling about them . The years have rushed by amazingly fast . I 'm in my 10th year now with them , counting a sabbatical and the first year , in which I was co-conductor with Dimitri Mitropoulos . " Mr. Bernstein , by 1969 , will have held the directorship longer than any conductor since the Philharmonic and the New York Symphony were merged in 1928 and Toscanini was made musical director . To date , Mr. Bernstein has led more concerts than anyone in the 125-year history of the orchestra ? his 736th performance was given on Monday . Walter Damrosch conducted between 600 and 700 concerts with the New York Symphony and the Philharmonic , counting those before and after the merger . Toscanini led the orchestra 450 times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchestra 's move from Carnegie Hall to Philharmonic Hall at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and a box-office increase to virtual sell-outs of each performance . His departure in 1969 is expected to bring problems for the Philharmonic . It is recognized that no conductor has had his popularity . His salary has never been disclosed . Mr. Ames said yesterday that the Philharmonic will continue to rely on Mr. Bernstein for advice and Mr. Bernstein said that he will continue to give it . ' ' But when I say that I will always regard the Philharmonic as ' my ' orchestra , I do n't want it interpreted in any way as pejorative on Mr. X who takes over , " the conductor declared , Observers were also asking yesterday what successor could combine Mr. Bernstein 's combination of skill , flair and boxoffice appeal . Of the younger generation , conductors discussed are Zubin Mehta of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Lorin Maazel , who will be the guest conductor of the Philharmonic tonight . Herbert von Karajan , the controversial director of the Berlin Philharmonic ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned . Steinberg a Candidate Among the older statesmen , those considered as candidates are William Steinberg , the conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony , who also holds the title of principal guest conductor of the Philharmonic ; Erich Leinsdorf of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and George Szell of the Orchestra . Conductor of the New York Phiharmonic is considered to be one of the most important musical assignments In the world . The feeling among observers is that the candidates can be narrowed down to less than a dozen conductors . The guessing games have started and are likely to continue until the announcement . One already being played points to the coincidence of the termination dates of the contracts of Rudolf Bing , general manager of the Metropolitan Opera , and Mr. Bernstein . Both contracts end in 1969 , although Mr. Bing has a one-year renewal option . Mr. Bernstein 's interest in all forms of musical theater is widely known . Some observers suggested that he might be a candidate to succeed Mr. Bing.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
