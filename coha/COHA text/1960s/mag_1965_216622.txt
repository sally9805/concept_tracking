By day , while the temperature hovered near 90 , Athenians lounged at the beaches , sipped iced ouzo in cafes , and only the straw-hatted tourists defied the heat , toiling up to the Acropolis to commune with history . By night , the history was happening down below . <P> Thousands of students marched through Stadium and University streets , arms locked , chanting " Pa-pan-dre-ou , " and passing out leaflets exhorting , " Young men of Athens , help us for the triumph of democracy . Down with traitors ! " Finally , the demonstrations became riots , and police were forced to quell a stone-throwing mob with clubs and tear gas . <P> The man whose name was the rioters ' rallying cry was ex-Premier George Papandreou , 77 , who had just been abruptly dismissed by King Constantine , 25 , in the first crisis of his 16-month reign .

It was about this time that Andreas Papandreou , the Premier 's 47-year-old son , who is his spokesman and a member of his Cabinet , had visited the island . <P> <P> The conservative Defense Minister wanted to investigate Aspida 's leftists further , but Premier Papandreou said no . Instead , he named two colonels from the K.Y.P. to purge right-wing army leadership , which he indicated he suspected of plotting a coup against him . Garoufalias crisply refused to take his orders from the two colonels , and so Papandreou decided that Garoufalias had to go . <P>
