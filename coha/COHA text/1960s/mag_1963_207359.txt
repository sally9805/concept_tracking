These wretched people are sent to filthy slaughterhouses like a herd of sick , neglected cattle . But I wo n't talk about it , I only get nightmares from such thoughts . <P> - Anne Frank , The Diary of a Young Girl <P> Anne Frank 's nightmares finally ended in the concentration camp in Bergen-Belsen in March 1945 . Last week the man who , as Adolf Eichmann 's legal expert , helped organize the roundup of Anne and 110,000 other Dutch Jews was arrested in Austria and held for investigation on the charge of having " aided and abetted " the massacre . He was former SS Captain Erich Rajakowitsch , 57 , for whom life as a respectable businessman in Italy had abruptly come to an end . <P> " Heart &; Soul . " Born in Trieste , the son of a prosperous merchant , Rajakowitsch became a lawyer and moved to Vienna , where his intelligence and good looks soon earned him a wide circle of friends . One of them was Adolf Eichmann , who in 1938 was busy planning the expulsion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eichmann , provided a neat formula whereby the Nazis got quick cash ransoms from Jews who were forced to quit the country . When Rajakowitsch formally applied to join the SS , Eichmann wrote a warm letter recommending him as " somebody who puts himself at the disposal of the cause with heart and soul , a National Socialist of the purest race . " <P> He was that , all right . Rajakowitsch traveled as Eichmann 's deputy to Czechoslovakia , Poland and Berlin ; then , in 1941 he was rushed to The Netherlands , where intermittent month-long protest riots had broken out in major cities after the Nazis ' first raid on the Jewish quarter of Amsterdam . Rajakowitsch soon got the roundups rolling smoothly . As boss of the dreaded Section IV-B-4 ( Special Office for Jewish Affairs ) in Holland , he was so thorough that when he was asked to spare a handful of Jews of Portuguese origin , he declared , " Jews are Jews-out ! " <P> Tired of Running . Soon afterward , Rajakowitsch dropped from sight , and many believed he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eichmann told Israeli police that he had talked to his old friend in Buenos Aires after the war , the net started moving around him . Simon Wiesenthal , chief of the Jewish Documentation Center in Vienna , who had helped track down Eichmann , traced Rajakowitsch to Milan . There , under the name Enrico Raja , he had built up a flourishing business importing metals and machinery from Communist Eastern Europe . <P> Since Rajakowitsch was legally still an Austrian citizen , Wiesenthal asked Vienna cops to request his extradition . They refused ; Italian police refused to expel him . Finally , about three weeks ago , Wiesenthal took the whole story to Milan 's ( and Italy 's ) biggest newspaper , Corriere della Sera , which printed it. *At that , Rajakowitsch fled to a Swiss villa he owned near Lake Lugano , but was quickly expelled as an " unwanted person " by the authorities . Tired of the chase , Rajakowitsch hopped a flight to Munich , then drove to Vienna where he gave himself up . He had expected to be freed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " very surprising , " since he had come back only to " clear myself . " <P>
