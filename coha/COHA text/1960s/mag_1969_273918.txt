Along with its big , intercity trunk air lines and its smaller , regional carriers , the U.S. has still another kind of air service-and it is the fastest-growing of all . More than 4,000 short-haul outfits will carry about 725,000 passengers this year in small planes that fly between convenient downtown airports or to and from smaller towns and cities . For years the lines have been known rather ingloriously as " third-level carriers , " but their safety standards have often been so third-rate that some customers call them " white-knuckle airlines . " <P> Passengers have hair-curling stories about many of the little lines , including engine failures , landings with the landing gear retracted , and even running out of gas . Recently , a Cleveland-bound Wright Air Lines flight out of Detroit barely made it across Lake Erie to a safe if silent emergency landing in a field in Canada ; the pilot had neglected to check the fuel before taking off . Denver 's Aspen Airways navigates around 14,000-ft. mountain peaks while flying at 13,500 ft. without benefit of cabin pressure or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line bills itself as " the world 's fastest ski lift . " <P> Shoestring Taxis . According to Washington 's National Transportation Safety Board , the little lines have an accident fatality rate of 7.65 deaths per 100 million passenger-miles . The U.S. trunk and regional carriers , by contrast , have a fatality rate of .25 per 100 million passenger-miles . <P> The troubles have been caused mainly by the carriers ' fast growth . Few of today 's 240 scheduled small lines existed as recently as 1964 , and regulation lags behind . As FAA rules now stand , all an operator needs before going into the business is a commercial pilot 's license , which can be earned with less than 200 hours of training . Pilots for the major airlines need a minimum 1,200 hours , plus instrument-flying proficiency . <P> <P> The better third-level carriers , including some of the scheduled services that the FAA calls " commuter air carriers , " demand airline-style experience of their pilots-but most do not . At the bottom are the unscheduled " air taxis , " many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for various chores and use smaller and less well-equipped planes than the commuters . <P> Such shoestring operators are responsible for most of the third level 's harum-scarum reputation , but things get a bit dicey at times even on the better commuter lines . Cleveland-based Wright and TAG airlines of Detroit accounted for all of 29 ground alerts at Cleveland 's Burke Lakefront Airport during one recent twelve-month period . Eight of the alerts involved closing the airport and rolling out the fire engines , though there were no accidents . <P> The commuters mostly fly small prop planes , but they owe their development to the jet age . Larger airlines have left the field clear for them in towns and cities where meager traffic will not support the costly big transports . And in many cases , the small carriers have made themselves essential . Rural Spencer , Iowa , found itself so isolated that town officials invited Minnesota 's Fleet Airlines to provide regular service to larger cities and happily agreed to make up any losses .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
