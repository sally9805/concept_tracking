 | Christmas does n't always come on December twenty-fifth . Not if the heart of Christmas is the sense of something new and wonderful happening , a special blessing coming into your life . Once , at our house , our real Christmas came in February . We began preparing for it on an evening in October , 1967 , the night we decided to adopt Jennifer , a child of mixed racial background . We arrived at our decision in an almost offhand fashion . I can only explain this lack of soul-searching by saying I believe that really important decisions , those that can change the shape and direction of our lives , are the consequence of the lifetime leading up to them . Ideas and experiences flow together , making some decisions seem almost inevitable . My husband  | Jim and I were watching television that October evening . Our four children were finally in bed . Beth , the eldest , a high school senior and a conscientious student , needed no urging . James , fifteen , and Peter , fourteen , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guitar concerts for the night , Keith , the youngest , who shared a room with Peter despite the ten-year difference in their ages , had fallen asleep promptly . Now the songs and chatter of a television variety show kept us from too jarring a descent into silence . We have to unwind gradually . In addition to television there 's always the accumulation of the previous Sunday 's New York Times ( a subscription is my annual wedding-anniversary present to Jim ) , and assorted magazines piled between us to fill dull stretches on television . The house quiet , this was a good time to talk , I suppose , but both Jim and I were tired . Besides , companionship sometimes runs deeper than words . We must have been especially close that evening when I said idly , " I keep hearing so much about the need for homes for babies with a mixed racial background . We could take one of those children if we really wanted to . " My husband 's response came promptly . I might have suggested we have friends over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked . " Boy or girl ? " " Better a girl , " he said after a brief pause . " Good . Beth 'll be going away to school next year and I 'd welcome another girl . Beth will love a new baby ! Remember how thrilled she was with Keith ? She wo n't mind a crib in her room . What kind of background would our baby have , do you suppose ? Part Oriental ? " Jim was positive on this point . " Ask for a child with a part Negro background . They 're the ones that are hard to place . " " I 'll ask , " I promised , " but where ? " " Downtown , at the State Department of Public Assistance . Their offices are in the annex building behind the courthouse . " I nodded , content . " I 'll take Keith with me and go down there tomorrow . " That ended the conversation . There was a magician on television who was really quite good and we even stopped reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning Keith and I were ushered into a tiny office to meet Mrs. Gaylord , a caseworker . I had n't explained our errand to Keith . At four , he just liked to go on expeditions with me . Almost my first remark after introductions was , " We 're interested in adopting a child with a mixed racial background , probably Negro . We understand they 're the ones who especially need homes . " Mrs. Gaylord 's face lit up . She whisked out some forms and a note pad , lifted her pencil and looked up expectantly . " Wonderful ! Let 's get started ! " It was to be four months from that first interview till we brought our new baby daughter " home , a short waiting period we 're told by other adoptive parents . To us it seemed excessively long . Of course there were preparations to make at our end , too . Bringing the children into our plans came first . Beth was delighted . " But make them hurry , Mother , so I can share the baby as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " James , confronted with our proposal , groaned . " What do you want to get a baby for when we do n't even have a dog ! " The hint was clear enough , since Hildy , our dachshund pet of nine years , was no more . Meekly , I promised we would consider first things first . Soon ' after , on James ' sixteenth birthday , Jim presented him with a six-weeksold dachshund . After the birthday cake and ice cream I asked James , " You have your dog ? now can I have the baby ? " " Yes , " he said .  | Peter , at fourteen , was intensely practical . " Why do you want more kids ? You 've got us . Seems to me you 're busy enough already . " I agreed , but I doubted that one more in the family would add much of a burden and anyway , a baby would give me a reason to stay home more . " But will you ? " he asked , a confirmed skeptic in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll try , " I said honestly . I was very casual in explaining our plan to Keith , who was , after all , only four . Though necessary procedures were well under way , something might come up at the last minute . I did n't want to place undue stress on an event that might not materialize . " We 'll see what Mrs. Gaylord says , " I pointed out to Keith . " I 'll be sure to tell you if she has any news , but till then we wo n't talk about it outside our family . After all , we may not get a baby . It 's like wishing for a Christmas present ? maybe you 'll get it , maybe you wo n't . " " I know , " Keith said happily , " but we can hope we 'll get a baby ! " He never leaked a word of our family secret , though sometimes when the two of us were by ourselves he asked if Mrs. Gaylord had called . Beth fretted that she might miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from school every day asking eagerly , " Did Mrs. Gaylord call ? Then you call her , Mother . Please , for my sake ! " Christmas approached and still no word . It was a strangely quiet holiday with the same air of expectancy I had felt Christmas four years ago , a month before Keith was born . Now , again , a baby had been promised and we were all waiting . At the close of Christmas Day I asked Keith if he had gotten what he 'd wanted . " Oh , yes ! " he responded . Then , " Did you , Mommy ? " " All of you gave me such nice things , " I began . " But my special present has n't come yet . " " I know ! " His eyes brightened . " You mean our secret ? our baby Mrs. Gaylord 's going to find for me- That 's why I say our real Christmas came in February . Mrs. Gaylord , our tardy Santa Claus , called and came to tell us the good news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , presently in another town . We were to contact Mrs. Gaylord if we decided we wanted to go ahead . Later , we eagerly pored over the pictures , which showed a cheerful infant , looking older than her three months , sitting propped up in the corner of a sofa . " She 's adorable ! " Beth said warmly . " When can we go get her ? " A week later we were on our way " just to see her , " as I firmly reminded everybody , Mrs. Gaylord had said more than once that perhaps we 'd feel this just was n't our baby and there would assuredly be other referrals . But my family was serenely confident that there would be one more passenger in the already crowded car on our return . I had finally unwrapped the baby blanket and diapers I 'd bought but feared to display , up to now , out of some kind of superstition . I had confided in one friend , however , so I could borrow a car bed till we got a crib @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ! It was noon when we arrived at what we considered , under the circumstances , an unusual meeting place : a motel . It seemed a strange , almost furtive place in which to meet the baby who might be ours , except that , as Mrs. Gaylord explained , a motel served well as neutral ground for caseworker , child and prospective adoptive family . There we would have that sense of privacy , with an air of relaxed comfort , that a bleak office setting could not offer . " We want you to meet your new baby in a setting at least approaching a real home , " she had said , " so you can feel what it will be like being together in your own home . " We checked into our unit . The children , delighted to have a holiday from school , had chattered continuously during the trip . Now , suddenly , they were quiet . We clustered around Jim as he placed the call to the caseworker at this end . She promised she 'd be over in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given money for hamburgers and milk shakes . My feelings were so turbulent I could n't even think of food . Jim turned on the television set . We watched the local station 's seemingly endless weather report , grateful that it filled the enormous emptiness of the time remaining . I tried to imagine holding " our " baby , but I shrank from visualizing it too clearly for fear of a disappointment . It was , as I had told Keith , like wanting a very special Christmas present ? one you 're not sure you 'll get . The children came back , carrying lunches . Their presence eased the tension somewhat , Beth begged me to share her milk shake . " I 'm not hungry after all , " she declared . " Is n't that queer ? " After some false alarms ? people checking in or out of other units ? there was a knock at our door at last . We all leaped up to answer it . Jim accorded me the privilege . " Sit down , children . Mother will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included , as I opened the door to a young woman carrying a shapeless bundle of yellow blankets in her arms . She seemed yotmg for a caseworker , I thought , sweet and vulnerable . She held the bundle to her as though she feared she 'd drop it . When she spoke her voice was husky , as though she 'd been crying . After the introductions she moved over to one of the twin beds and laid the bundle down carefully . Without turning around , she said , " Here 's the person you 've really come to meet . " I went over to the bed and with hands that trembled drew aside the folds of blanket . A tiny , dark face looked up at me wide-eyed and then , magically , the baby smiled ! My heart seemed to expand with the joy I felt . She knew me ! She knew I was her new mother ! I tried to say something reassuring to the rest of the family , but I could n't get a word out . I lifted our new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . The boys were solemn , almost reverent , at the sight . Beth exclaimed and laughed with delight . Jim 's eyes met mine above their heads and I nodded . " We 'll take her , " he said huskily to the caseworker . The ride home seemed longer than the trip over , despite our festive mood . We were all a little overcome by the responsibility we had assumed in a moment . Jennifer ( we had agreed on the name weeks before ) was fussy . Beth and I took turns holding her or offering the bottle of formula which had been given to us by the caseworker , along with a carton of baby clothes and some tins of formula powder . Still , at times , she 'd stiffen in our arms and scream dreadfully . Jim , who was driving , asked plaintively , " What are you doing to our baby ? Pinching her ? " Once home , the children trooped wearily off to bed without protest . I changed Jenny 's diaper , put on her rather worn nightgown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in my arms and sat down in the old family rocker , where I had rocked our other four as babies . The pleasant creaking of the chair , my own feeling of peace or perhaps the just-right fit of my arms ? something soothed Jennifer at last . After drinking almost a whole bottle she fell asleep . It was a blessed night of uninterrupted slumber for us all . The next morning , breakfast over , Keith was ready to introduce Jennifer to the neighbors ? especially to his regular playmate , Lisa , and her older brother , who live next door , Keith went to get them and returned a few minutes later with Lisa , who gravely studied the occupant of the car bed , Lisa 's pale blonde hair and straw-lashed blue eyes contrasted sharply with Jennifer 's bobbing dark head , amber-brown face and the dark eyes she crinkled into friendly smiles . Soon the kindergarten crowd came by , followed later by first- and second-grade acquaintances and soon the mothers . Keith , in particular , was bursting with pride . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me to the store for a loaf of bread I did not need . I wanted to sound out the outer world for myself . At the drugstore and the grocery , where I know most of the employees , we were met with friendly interest . Emboldened , I went to a suburban department store . There I sensed that heads were turning , that curious but friendly stares followed us . I heard two teen-age girls exclaim , " Look at the cute colored baby that woman 's carrying ! " But their tone was kind . Children continually ask , " Is that your baby ? She does n't look like you ! " To their direct queries and to obviously interested adults I volunteer the explanation , " This is our adopted baby girl . She has two traditions ; some of her ancestors were African and some of her ancestors were white . " We wondered what reaction might come from Negro observers . ( Black friends have been warmly approving . They would have given their blessing to our adoption of a child of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family foray to a Seattle shopping center , where crowds reflect a racial mixture broader than that of our hometown , a saleslady in a shoe store , a Negro , swept Jennifer out of my arms and over to see the other clerks , most of them white . The woman 's delight could hardly have been surpassed if she were showing off her own child . One white friend made a disconcerting discovery , however , in relation to a gift she brought over for Jennifer . " I could n't find a single card showing a dark-skinned baby , " the friend explained . " Do card manufacturers think white families are the only ones who have babies and want to send each other best wishes ? " I wondered , too . In all my searching I have found only one picture book for youngsters which shows children of a variety of racial backgrounds playing with the usual Teddy bears , cups and baby possessions . Where are the illustrated editions of Mother Goose and simple fairy tales with which Jennifer will be able to identify ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week after we had brought her home . Her " coming-out party " was a great occasion . The list of well-wishers included people in the government of our state of Washington , headed by Governor Dan Evans ? people my husband not only works with but those we regard as personal friends . That night it was n't " Governor and Mrs. Evans " but Dan and Nancy . They brought a mobile of little wooden figures to hang over Jennifer 's crib . " Our boys had one just like this and they loved it , " Nancy explained . Sid Smith , head of the State Department of Public Assistance , declared that , since we had used the resources of his department in finding Jennifer , he considered himself her godfather , and we agreed . Jenny , composed despite the evening hour , happily nestled in the lap of Bette Johnson , wife of the Republican state chairman , while I opened helpful gifts : a diaper bag , some enchanting dresses , crib sheets , a newly opened bank account , sweaters , even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we laid Jennifer in an heirloom belonging to our hostess ? an antique hanging cradle . She stared solemnly at the procession of guests who bent over her for a good look . Then I changed Jennifer into the pink nightgown she 'd received as a gift and we headed for home a few blocks away . Jennifer was asleep by the time we arrived . She still takes social occasions in stride . Announcing Jennifer 's arrival to Jim 's parents and my mother called for diplomacy . After the birth of our first child , Beth , we became rather casual about such news . To show you how offhand we had become , Jim let his parents know of the arrival of Peter , our third child , by sending them a postcard ? three days after the event ! His mother has never gotten over it . We opted for the casual approach once more to tell my mother and my in-laws about Jennifer . In my weekly letters to them I simply said , " Hearing of the need for  | homes for children of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , who is half Negro , half Caucasian , into our family . " I described Jennifer 's charms and our delight in her and ended , " We think you 'll love her when you meet her . " We avoided the word adoption ; we planned to supply details in easy stages , depending on their reaction . Jim 's parents have borne up gallantly under other unpredictable moves by their four children , however . They did so this time , too . " Jennifer sounds delightful , " their letter said . " We 're looking forward to meeting our newest grandchild . " We sighed with relief . It was hard to maintain a cheerful , confident note in my letter to my own mother . She worried that the four children we already had were a strain on my physical resources . Nor does my mother find Jim 's unquenchable enthusiasm for politics reassuring . Even his present position as administrative assistant to the Governor must be considered vulnerable . I braced myself for Mother 's questions : " After the Governor 's term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fair to your own four children ? " Days passed and there was no response from my mother . When her letter finally arrived I seized it and went off by myself to read it . It was an heroic letter , expressing my mother 's rejoicing for and with me . She pointed out that she was , after all , of another generation , one bewildered by much that was happening today . But she had faith in the rightness of our decision , she said , and that surely our whole family would be blessed . Beth soon left us to become a student at Swarthmore College , in Pennsylvania , where Jim and I went to school , met and fell in love . I made a sentimental journey back there , in the fall of 1968 , to help our daughter settle in . Jennifer , by then a year old , made the trip by plane with us . I could n't have brought myself to leave her with a stranger . In any case , it cost nothing to take her along , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my sister and her family who live in the Philadelphia area . My sister had responded to our news with affectionate good wishes and a flower-sprinkled dress Jennifer wore her first Easter , but she had expressed some anxiety simply on the score of adoption . " It 's so hard to know how children born to you will turn out . With an adopted child , there 's so much more uncertainty . " I wanted her to meet Jennifer , to see for herself that at least we had made a happy beginning . As a former elementary-school teacher , surely she knew how important good beginnings are . Jennifer took to her aunt and uncle ? and their three children ? immediately . They were delighted with her . The day after our arrival my sister drove us over to the college . Beth registered and we headed for the dormitory , where she would meet her roommate and the other girls who would be her new friends . On our way into the building Beth turned to me . " Let me carry Jennifer , Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on ahead , dear . Jennifer and I will catch up . This is a whole new chapter in your life , and I do n't want you distracted by a baby sister just now . I 'll carry her . Thanks anyway . " Beth stopped and held out her arms imperiously . " Please , Mother . You 'll be going back soon and I wo n't see you or Jennifer for months and months . I 'll miss holding her . She wo n't even remember me by Christmas . I want to hold her every last precious minute I can ! " So Beth went to meet her new college friends carrying a dark-skinned , bright-eyed baby in her arms . After she introduced herself her first words were , " And this is my baby sister , Jennifer . " Beth 's generation being what it is ? hopeful , truly concerned ? was well represented that day . The girls opened their hearts to Jennifer and to Beth . Of all the responses to our adoption of Jennifer , the one I bear with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant , " How wonderful of you to do this for this child ! " I quickly respond , " We 're the lucky ones ! " Jennifer represents no @#  | cause . " Being a mother is one of the happiest , most deeply satisfying experiences in my life . Jennifer has simply extended my opportunity to do what I most enjoy . Jennifer has enlarged our family in another , special way . Before she came to us I used to categorize people as " we " and " they . " " They " were strangers , members of other races than my own , dark-skinned people , people of a different color with features shaped differently from my own . But once I had taken Jennifer into my arms and felt her tiny dark arms curl trustingly around my neck , " they " became part of the " we . " Jennifer has made the term " the human family " a reality . Never again , I trust , will I refuse to acknowledge another human being as one of our family , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people comment , " I , suppose by now you do n't even notice Jennifer 's dark skin , " I reply honestly that , far from ignoring the differences between Jenny and our other children , I cherish them ! Color is but one of the differences . At the outset I did n't have an attitude one way or the other on the subject , and when a Negro friend , a guest at Jennifer 's shower , commented gently , " Is n't she a lovely color ! " I was at a loss for words , words both honest and natural . Every mother knows that each of her children is unique in appearance , disposition and character . There are resemblances , but aside from identical twins , no exact copies . I would be an unnatural mother if I pretended I did not see , did not notice a very noticeable aspect of Jennifer 's appearance . However , just as I delight in our eldest boy 's blue eyes ( he 's the only one of our children who has them ) , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a lovely color ! " Black is beautiful " is not just a slogan but a joyful , if belated , recognition of but one group of people among our fellow human beings . " I suppose you 'll try straightening her hair when she 's older ; " some . have commented . " Why should I ? " is my response . I marvel over the texture of her hair , so different from my own , which is limp and obstinately uncurly . Jennifer 's hair is so alive , so soft , and yet it springs up in a thousand tiny corkscrew curls . I love to nestle my cheek against it . I shampoo her hair almost nightly and brush it lightly into a dark cloud that suits her perfectly just now . When she 's older , she 'll decide for herself how she wants to fix it ? her older sister Beth has always had definite ideas on her own hairstyles ! More serious challenges to the step we have taken may well come along . When Jennifer goes to school , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby ? Will her schoolmates taunt her with the same foul names hurled at the one black child who was attending Keith 's elementary school ? How can I help prepare Jennifer for 1 such real possibilities ? Will friends with sons Jennifer 's age cool toward her when she reaches dating age ? I can not deny that I have misgivings , moments of inadequacy and doubt . All I can say is that our experiences so far are grounds for hope . I choose to be optimistic . I remember that Jennifer 's first steps were toward our arms ? her brothers ' , her sister 's , her mother and father 's ? reaching out to her in love . We were able to catch her and reassure her if she faltered or fell . But what about the days and years ahead when she must walk alone ? We pray that the love and security we are able to give her now , during these formative years , will enable her to some day make her way alone ? as some day she must . But our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new world is coming whether we 're ready or not ? a world in which all men will have learned to live together . We 've been hearing and reading about this world . We might only have read and heard about it . With Jennifer 's help , I believe this particular family will get to live in it ! Yes , we are the lucky ones . We already had had four blessings : Beth , James , Peter and Keith . Jennifer is our fifth , a special blessing for whom , come what may , I shall always be grateful .
