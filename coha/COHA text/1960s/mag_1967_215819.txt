WASHINGTON 'S scruffy Ambassador Theater , normally a pad for psychedelic frolics , was the scene of an unscheduled scatological solo last week in support of the peace demonstrations . Its anti-star was Author Norman Mailer , who proved even less prepared to explain Why Are We in Viet Nam ? than his current novel bearing that title . <P> Slurping liquor from a coffee mug , Mailer faced an audience of 600 , most of them students , who had kicked in $1,900 for a bail fund against Saturday 's capers . " I do n't want to grandstand unduly , " he said , grandly but barely standing . <P> It was one of his few coherent sentences . Mumbling and spewing obscenities as he staggered about the stage-which he had commandeered by threatening to beat up the previous M.C.-Mailer described in detail his search for a usable privy on the premises . Excretion , in fact , was his preoccupation of the night . " I 'm here because I 'm like L.B.J. , " was one of Mailer 's milder observations . <P> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When hecklers mustered the temerity to shout " Publicity hound ! " at him , Mailer managed to pronounce flawlessly his all-purpose noun , verb and expletive : " **** you " <P> Dwight Macdonald , the bearded literary critic , was aghast at the barroom bathos , but failed to argue Mailer off the platform . Macdonald eventually squeezed in the valorous observation that Ho Chi Minh was really no better than Dean Rusk . After more obscenities , Mailer introduced Poet Robert Lowell , who got annoyed at requests to speak louder . " I 'll bellow , but it wo n't do any good , " he said , and proceeded to read from Lord Weary 's Castle . By the time the action shifted to the Pentagon , Mailer was perky enough to get himself arrested by two marshals . " I transgressed a police line , " he explained with some pride on the way to the lockup , where the toilet facilities are scarce indeed and the coffee mugs low-octane.               @ @ @ @ @ @
