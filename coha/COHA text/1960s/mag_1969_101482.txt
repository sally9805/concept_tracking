The Minnesota Vikings , a team which could not quite believe its own prowess until a couple of weeks ago , took a giant step toward establishing itself as a champion in the Green Bay mold by handily defeating the Detroit Lions 24-10 in Bloomington , Minn. last Sunday . The Vikings won on the cool , intelligent passing of Joe Kapp , who spent eight years throwing footballs in the Canadian League and is now in his third year chucking for Minnesota , Playing with his broken left wrist in. a light cast , Kapp completed 11 of 19 passes in the face of a Lion rush that dropped him for a loss four times . // The Vikings won , too , oh a fierce effort by one of the best defensive units in pro ball ( see cover ) . It swarmed all over young Greg Landry , Detroit 's second-year quarterback , dropping him for losses six times and limiting him to a measly net of 60 yards passing . Landry also threw four interceptions , due in part to the big purple rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and competent team , and it may well mark the start of the kind of dynasty that Vince Lombardi founded at Green Bay in 1960 . There are , certainly , defects in this Viking team , as there were in the old Packers . The offensive line leaks on occasion , but Bud Grant , the quiet Minnesota coach , has help on hand in Ron Yary , a massive tackle from USC , and Ed White , a big rookie guard from California . Yary , a No. 1 draft choice in 1968 , was in the service the first few weeks of this season , but he will probably start soon . White may still be a year away . If these two live up to their potential , Kapp may find more time to throw , and , given time , he can perform wonders , as he did against Baltimore earlier in the season when he threw seven touchdown passes in a 52-14 rout . // Minnesota 's redoubtable ground attack was ineffective against the Lions , but that may be because Grant , who felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air in 1968 , has devoted much of his practice time to improving that aspect of the game . // Gene Washington , who caught four passes for 68 yards against Detroit , feels the passing is now well established . " This is my third year and Joe 's , " he says . " We work together real well now . I have options on my patterns depending upon whether the coverage is zone or man-to-man , and that means Joe only has a second or two to read me . Now that we 've worked together for a while , that 's all the time he needs . " // Jim Marshall , the 10-year veteran at end who captains the Viking defense , is of much the same opinion about his play with his violent colleagues on the Viking line . Against the Lions , Marshall , Carl Eller , Alan Page and Gary Larsen varied their attack on nearly every play , often twisting  --  or stunting , as it used to be called  --  with the tackle circling to the outside and the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat on Landry , who was replacing the injured Bill Munson . // " In time , you get confidence in the people you play with , " says Marshall . " I know what Page the right tackle is going to do and what Lonnie Warwick the middle linebacker will do , and I can react instinctively . Some of the stunts are planned . Maybe Page and I will decide on the stunt and tell the linebackers what we 're going to do . But sometimes we 'll stunt because the blocking opens up , and when we do that , we have to depend on our instinctive reactions . You do n't always beat the other guy , you know . He 's getting paid a good salary to beat you . You know when you go in that you 're only going to win so many of the individual battles . You just have to win more than you lose . " // Marshall and Co. won more individual battles than they lost against Detroit . Landry completed 14 of 28 , but when you subtract from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wound up with a net of 1.8 yards per attempt . The Lions were only a trifle more effective on the ground , gaining 107 yards in 33 runs . They crossed the 50-yard line but once in the first half and scored their lone touchdown late in the game , after the cause was well lost , with the aid of an interference penalty . // A little over a year ago , when Minnesota was preparing to play Chicago in Bloomington after impressive wins over Atlanta and Green Bay , the team was taut and unsure of itself . Its Saturday practice was quiet , tense ; it was a team that had finished last in the Central Division the year before , and you felt , watching the players , that they were n't convinced they were good enough to be leading the division . // " Clubs like the Bears and the Rams used to intimidate us , " says General Manager Jim Finks . " Not physically . Psychologically . They seemed to be mentally tougher than we were . But we got over that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oct. 12 . We took it to them and they folded , not us. " // Last week the Vikings were relaxed , casual and assured . On Saturday the players bought a birthday cake for Equipment Manager Stubby Eason , which featured a lumpy chocolate football planted in the middle of a bilious green football field , and sang a Rabelaisian version of Happy Birthday before eating most of the cake themselves . Gary Cuozzo , the No. 2 quarterback , brought his 2-year-old son Chip to the workout , then had to call his wife to come get him when , despite the blandishments of half the team , he howled steadily for 30 minutes . // When the Vikes came out on the field , Kapp took charge , and the players responded , running plays all the way to the goal line . They worked out an hour and a half earlier than most clubs do on Saturday , finishing at about 10 a.m . " Coach wants to go partridge hunting , " one veteran explained . // In his three-year tenure as head coach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's a tall , handsome man with bright blue eyes and a soft tone that commands attention because you can hardly hear it . // " He never raises his voice , " says Center Mick Tingelhoff . " He 's as complete a change as you can get from Van Brocklin his predecessor at Minnesota . All he has to do is look at you when you make a mistake and it cuts deeper than a 10-minute lecture from Van Brocklin. " // " When Van Brocklin left , there was no doubt in my mind who I wanted , " Finks says . " Grant has always been a winner . He used to coach in Canada , and he learned a very valuable lesson there . You get kids right out of Canadian high schools , graduates from American colleges and old pros from the NFL who have gone over the hill or left the NFL for some other reason . Grant handled all of them , and well . " // Grant , who played both offensive and defensive end for the Eagles , was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 10 years at Winnipeg , brought Kapp down from Canada . Kapp had difficulty adjusting to NFL defenses , but he has always had an overriding belief in his ability to win , and he imparts it to the team . " Joe makes you know it will work , " says Running Back Clinton Jones . " You feel it in the huddle . He 's a mover. " // The Joe Kapp of the defense is Marshall , who once ran the wrong way for a safety for the other team and now heads up the rush . The Minnesota front four may not be as famous as that of Los Angeles or Dallas , but they could be better . They are called the Four Norsemen , although three  --  Carl Eller , Alan Page and Marshall  --  are black . // Marshall is 6 ' 4 " 260 , wears flaring sideburns and a modest mustache , and has an unbridled desire to win at almost any cost . He is also an introspective , articulate man . " We have been progressing in our mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game . " We did n't know how to accept victory before . Each victory is a step on the stairway to success , but we worried about little mistakes instead of forgetting them . Now we 're confident enough to forget the mistakes . Bud Grant pushes you toward goals which make you realize your full potential as an individual . // " Do n't be fooled by our flamboyant attitude at practice today , " he went on . " We 're still nervous about this game . It 's a big one . The flamboyance is the product of apprehension . But beneath the apprehension is a confidence that we can do what we have to do . It 's the feeling Green Bay used to have , a feeling that we 're developing . " // With that feeling , Minnesota 's regal purple could be , appropriately , the color of a new dynasty .
