With this admonition still in my ears I drove down to Bien Hoa with a friendly AID man who was to deliver me to my host . In his fresh cords and neat tie he could have been catching the 8 24 from White Plains  --  except for the pistol I spotted in his attache case . Ben Suc lay heavily on my mind and it turned out that my companion had been in charge of the refugees on January 8 when the operation began . My acquaintance of the evening before might have been pleased by the AID man 's compassion : " Ben Suc was about the nicest , lushest village you ever saw There were shade trees and big houses with the roofs , strong cattle and hard ferry landings so the people could bathe on the banks of the river . " He asserted , however , that the 3,800 villagers were " mostly VC families , and had been for twenty-five years " A great problem for those planning the operation , he said , was that no refugee camp could be set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand of the planners . The " refugees " ( Webster says . " Refugee . . . one who flees to a place of safety " ) with their animals and belongings found themselves transported initially to shelters holding ten families , each family in 10 x 20 feet . " Several hundred people . " he said , have " filtered back " to the Ben Suc area , although it is now a Free Fire Zone ( anything moving is an unquestioned target ) in which they " must take their chances . " Ben Suc is not a " secure area . " What then , I asked , was accomplished ? He replied that an assembly point had been " denied " to a VC battalion and that a significant VC Headquarters may have fallen as well He had n't seen the refugees since six days after the investing of Ben Suc ( " I was n't on that job too long " ) but he believed their accommodations to be better than before . Also , " the Vietnamese , unlike Europeans , are very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I discovered that my old friend was now a very important AID man in Third Corps ( twelve provinces ) operations . And he , too , had played a significant role at Ben Suc . He plunged straight into accounts of the raid given by the Times and The New Yorker ( journals much maligned as " trouble making " by his colleagues ) , which he regarded as generally accurate . All refugee operations are horrible , he agreed , remarking further that he might justly be convicted as a war criminal for his role in this one . But after all , " it was best for all concerned if the villagers were moved . " Contradicting his colleague with whom I had just driven out , he insisted that any idea of Ben Suc as a prosperous village was " bullshit " ; he mentioned particularly that there were no schools . " All refugee movements are miserable , but this was the most successful in the history of the world , " because the people were allowed a long time to move and could bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , to argue fiercely against the army 's scheme for Ben Suc : to knock out all 3,800 villagers with gas sprayed from the air , and let them wake up after they had been carted unconscious to a " secure " site . My friend told me he insisted during the operational planning that this would create 3,800 " instant Vietcong , " and persuaded the top echelon to allow a peaceful move over an " extended period . " Naturally , some people in Ben Sue were VC and tried to escape , which explains the shootings and imprisonments . But it was not true , he continued , that the village was VC ; it was basically " friendly  --  with a VC infrastructure of course . " The army spread the story of Ben Sue being a Vietcong village in order to make its destruction more acceptable in America . I announced that I wished to visit the Ben Sue area to see what remained . My friend , who had already offered me every facility including a personal helicopter , replied that Ben Sue was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zone , " and that if I landed I would n't last fifteen seconds . What , I wanted to know , was gained by the removal of the 3,800 people eight months before ? " They were saved from the cross fire of war . " An hour later I was flying  --  or rather swooping  --  over the Iron Triangle . Under normal circumstances a three-man helicopter must be man 's most marvelous form of locomotion , diving and soaring , hovering and banking high and low . It offered me a horribly perfect and perfectly horrible view . The term Iron Triangle is journalese . Far from being a Maginot Line-like area , it is  --  or rather was  --  many square miles of flat , delta farming country , full of trees , paddies , ponds , streams , dikes and  --  once -- villages and people . Colors of brilliant green and earth brown predominated . All is changed . The Americans have , as my pilot said , " lowered the vegetation . " Thousands of trees have been knocked over to afford vast " fields of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were sprayed to prevent further rice planting , and are full of gigantic B-52 bomb craters , shell holes from the constant cannonading , and dive-bomb holes . Operation Cedar Falls , begun more than eight months ago , has settled into day after day of constant pounding from artillery and air , turning the whole once fertile shimmering farmland into a moonscape , m which the only human remains are the stone tombs of the Vietnamese which used to surround the villages . The irony is that the First Division still hardly dares venture into the area . My helicopter scooted through a steady barrage , saved from a shell below or a bomb above because the pilot constantly alerted Forward Observers about our course Somehow , miraculously , magically , despite the hourly battering that must make their teeth rattle , the Vietcong lurk in their holes , caves and tunnels , eating and drinking God knows what , but prepared to shoot anyone who ventures into what is clearly acknowledged to be their terrain . That explains why I was told not to land at Ben Suc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we flew over this lunatic wasteland my pilot said : " One year ago this was strictly Victor Charlie . Now , it 's calmed down considerably . " About thirty seconds later he added : " Chances are if we have to make a forced landing it would be quite a while before the VC got to us . Plenty of time for a rescue . " Then we were over Ben Suc . All the reports are right . There is nothing there . Great brown bulldozer swirls replace the village . The pilot spoke in my ear : " I walked down there  --  there used to be a street  --  and saw the people sitting in front of their houses . " We hovered , moved slightly , hovered again . We were about 100 feet up and I had to battle a sudden urge to Leap from the helicopter onto the bulldozer scars as a  --  useless  --  apology to the 3,800 . Before I could unbuckle myself we were shooting back the way we came . The pilot continued , ever helpful and instructive : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the VC . . . as a matter of fact we destroy pretty much anything that might be useful . Those B-52 raids are 398 THE NATION/October 23 , 1967 something . You never know when they 're coming . They ca n't be heard . Too high . Sometimes we bomb at night , so Charlie 's out harvesting and suddenly the whole world falls in around his ears . " As we flew across the Saigon River and over " friendly " territory , the contrast was startling . It was the " before " part of the picture : neatly articulated rice paddies , canals , the normal colors of nature , plenty of trees , and amongst the trees  --  people , in hamlets and villages , densely strung together . " Lowering the vegetation " entails more than knocking down coconut palms . But the refugee settlement at Lai Chu is not like a Vietnamese village in any respect , whether in environment , arrangement of houses or population make-up . Villages in this part of Vietnam are typically somewhat random in layout , interspersed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The gridlike pattern of Lai Chu in its grass-less , treeless , waterless , red-brown setting deceives the airborne observer into thinking he is looking down on an army camp . Five hundred and eighteen families live here in cement-block , aluminum-roofed , one-room " dwellings " ( the official word ) , each backed by a small garden . The two Americans in charge are fully dedicated to the welfare of the refugees  --  they must be to live in this bare and unpleasant place , housed in trailers and living on tinned PX food . I was taken round by one of the Americans , a recent junior college graduate and Navy veteran of Vietnam , now married to a Vietnamese . He is employed by the International Rescue Committee The people of Lai Chu built their own houses with American-supplied materials . For their labor they were paid in American cooking oil , which they exchanged in the neighboring village for other goods . Why , I asked , were they not paid in cash 's ' ' There is n't any . Besides , this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ( I used to hear the same explanation in Taiwan for why U.S. AID powdered milk was allowed to be sold ? it " got into the economy . " ) Each family in Lai Chu had received a plot of land from the government . To the surprise of the Americans , only 100 of the 518 families have claimed their deeds . " They do n't seem enthusiastic about farming . " I soon learned that more than half the families are without menfolk , many arc in jail , the NLF , the ARVN or dead . Furthermore , there is little water at Lai Chu and these people arc rice farmers . The Americans want them to cultivate peanuts and sweet potatoes , which meets with little response although the tools and seeds are waiting The young American seemed genuinely troubled that the people of Lai Chu do not claim or work their land . A good deal of international concern arose over Ben Sue and dozens of visitors arrive to see what has become of the villagers The camp is supposed to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw no reason why the refugees should trust the Americans or do anything they suggest , since it is we who destroyed their homes and uprooted their lives He looked hurt . " But we tell them we do n't work for the U S , or for Saigon We just want to help them . " During our conversation two American enlisted men who have formed an attachment to Lai Chu showed up with a truckload of scrap lumber All of the visible men  --  about four , none of whom was young  --  scrambled onto the truck , and began dropping the enormous boards onto the ground while a crowd of women and children watched , standing carefully in the meager shade of their houses to avoid the sun 's glare The boards would be used to improve the interiors of their houses . I stood with the people and asked them questions about their lives . Were they getting enough rice ? No , they were n't . Back at Bien Hoa 1 had been warned not to believe this " inevitable " story , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young American agreed with them They were " suppmed to be getting it from the Province ; but someone is sitting on it ? I 've heard rumors about the Vietnamese refugee administration selling the rice " ( It later developed that the Vietnamese official in charge was " away " and his storehouse locked ) I asked other questions as they crowded around , old ladies with betel-stained toothless mouths , young matrons , dozens of children Obviously , they thought I had conic to do something for them ; this made me feel helpless because I certainly could n't help them at all . I could only pry further into their miserable lives Why did n't they farm their plots ' " We are rice farmers . We have no water . We know nothing about peanuts " What did they want most ? " Rice to eat , rice to plant , a school , a pagoda , a medical center . . . . " The interpreter added , sadly . " They want everything . " Remembering that my fliend had said there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children had been to school there . Yes , yes . But they had stopped sending the children for some time because , afraid of the constant bombing , they preferred to keep them at home ( Back at Bien Hoa this was greeted with disbelief The bombing was going on near , not in Ben Suc , so why not send the children to school ? The villagers had in fact good reason to be afraid : Ben Suc had been bombed in 1965 ) If the war were over , would they stay in their new , clean village , or return to Ben Sue which they knew no longer existed ? " We would return . We are rice farmers , and there is water there and our family graves . " What if the Vietcong were there ? ( In Vietnam it is always important to treat the Vietcong as separate , and in no way connected with anyone present . ) " Oh , no ! We would stay here ! " This delighted the American who was listening . Looking at me triumphantly , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard here , they wanted nothing to do with Victor Charlie . I persisted . Why , if the war were over , would they prefer to stay away from Ben Suc with the VC in it ? They all began speaking at once . The interpreter said : " They are afraid . If they return to Ben Suc and the Vietcong are there , the Americans will come back and destroy the village again . " Later , sitting in the trailer of the second AID man I found yet another veteran of the Ben Suc operation , an army colonel , one of whose peripheral Jobs was keepingan eye on Lai Chu . After telling me how regularly the refugees received their rice ( I think he believed it ) and hearing the opposite from me , he told me with great seriousness of his difficulties in getting the Vietnamese authorities to cooperate in administering this kind of help . I pointed out that since we had taken total responsibility for wiping out Ben Suc , we also had ultimate responsibility for the survivors , particularly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the AID man , I asked him to say frankly how he would feel if the refugees went back to Ben Suc as they said they would in the event of peace . He replied he would be " very disappointed " because he " honestly " felt that he could provide a better life for them in Lai Chu than they could find at Ben Suc . Back in January , this same colonel had been reported as being full of enthusiasm for the Ben Suc operation As he rose to leave , I asked him if he would recommend more Ben Sucs elsewhere . He looked at me silently and suddenly said : " No . The Brass are after me to go after a much bigger place I 've been fighting them for five months . It 's not a good idea . We ca n't deal with this kind of problem . To tell you the truth , I do n't think we can afford any more Ben Sucs. "                  @ @ @
