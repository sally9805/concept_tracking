ONE of her fellow Congress Party members has likened Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to Kali , the Hindu goddess of destruction . Last week that description must have seemed terrifyingly apt to the party 's right-wing leaders , known collectively as the Syndicate . In a power struggle ; that may yet tear the party asunder ' and pose a grave threat to India 's fragile democracy , Mrs. Gandhi directly challenged the Syndicate and won a dramatic victory . <P> Convinced that classical socialism is the answer to India 's manifold economic problems , Indira over the past two years has grown increasingly impatient with the old guard 's conservative approach . Last month the quarrel flared into the open . Determined to trim Indira 's sails , the Syndicate selected Sanjiva Reddy , 56 , speaker of the lower house of Parliament and a longtime foe of the Prime Minister 's , as the Congress Party 's official nominee for the presidency. * Mrs. Gandhi responded by ramming through the nationalization of 14 major Indian banks . At the same time , she forced the resignation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Syndicate stalwart . <P> Unready for Reddy . Despite her opposition , Reddy 's election seemed assured . She had , after all , publicly though petulantly accepted his nomination , and the Congress Party held a 53% majority in the electoral college , whose 861-695 votes are distributed on a popular basis and are cast by 4,137 M.P.s and members of the 17 state legislatures . Then strange things began happening . The Prime Minister 's forceful action against the banks won her a measure of popular acclaim , and she carefully cast herself as the people 's champion . Hundreds of cabbies , ricksha drivers and scavengers , most bearing flowers , began to stage rallies at her New Delhi bungalow , in what seemed to be spontaneous demonstrations of Mrs. Gandhi 's popularity . The meetings had actually been arranged by her backers to unnerve the opposition , but the point was made nonetheless . <P> Only five days before the presidential election , she made her move . Apparently convinced that the Syndicate was plotting to dump her after the election and form a right-wing coalition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she indirectly advised her supporters , was Varahagiri Venkata Giri , 75 , who had been acting President since Husain 's death . It was an unprecedented breach of party discipline , and there was angry talk among Syndicate members that she ought to be suspended from the party . <P> The Syndicate had even greater cause for anger last week , when the presidential votes were counted . In a stunning upset , Giri won a narrow victory over Reddy . Left-wing Communist electors backed Giri almost unanimously . About 40% of Congress Party parliamentarians defied the Syndicate to vote for him . Giri polled 420,077 votes to Reddy 's 405,427.
