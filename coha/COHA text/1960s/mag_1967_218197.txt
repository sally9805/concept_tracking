Japan 's busy automakers last week rolled out a pair of gifts . The first , personally delivered to Emperor Hirohito 's palace by Nissan Motor Co . President Katsuji Kawamata , 62 , was a 100-m.p.h. limousine-at last ending imperial dependence on foreign makes . The second was a gleaming batch of figures . They showed that in 1966 Japan had bumped Britain out of its No. 3 spot , moved in behind the U.S. and Germany in world car and truck production . <P> A Place to Park . Now Japan 's fastest-growing industry , autos are matching the country 's phenomenal successes in cargo ships , cameras , steel and electrical equipment . Japanese manufacturers last year turned out 2,286,585 cars and trucks , which represents a 360% increase over 1960 , the year the industry began mass production in earnest . Though the total is about three-fourths of Germany 's sales , the ten major Japanese builders plan a 32% increase this year to 3,024,000 units , and they look to overhaul Germany in a year or two . <P> They have ample reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staple , but more and more Japanese have the affluence to join the 1-in-48 group with a car ( as compared with the U.S. l-in-2.4 ratio ) . Even now , Japanese cities are aswarm with cars . Tokyo residents may not buy a car unless they can prove that they have a place to park it . In Tokyo districts already choked by industrial air pollution , traffic cops counter the effects of auto-exhaust fumes by breathing bottled oxygen kept at precinct stations . Speaking of the market-though it could apply to the atmosphere as well-Nissan 's Kawamata says that " the ceiling is not even in sight yet . " <P> The industry 's two leaders-Toyota Motor Co. and Nissan , which account for 70% of Japan 's total production-are leading the push into overseas markets . Early attempts to export the underpowered , stiffly sprung cars built for Japan 's potholedroads were flops . Now , says Kawamata , we do not " take second place to any make . " Japan last year sold 266,000 cars and trucks from Kenya to South Korea . Best customer : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's $2,000 Corona and Nissan 's $2,300 Datsun are among the new rages on the road . <P> <P> Shopping Around . With their overseas push barely under way , the Japanese are fearful that other countries ' automakers , particularly Detroit , will soon try to return the compliment in force . So far , a foreign invasion has been held off by high ( up to 40% ) auto-import tariffs and a stiff capital-investment law that limits foreign ownership to 50% of any new venture and 15% of any existing Japanese firm . Japan is under strong world pressure to ease that law , and Ford is said to be shopping around for permanent residences for its men .
