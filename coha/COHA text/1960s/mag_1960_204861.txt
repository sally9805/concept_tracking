Relinquishing his omniscience for just a few seconds , Casey Stengel said : " God knows , I do n't know what 's wrong with Mickey Mantle . " <P> Since God is not talking , Mickey 's teammates and the country 's sportswriters have had to try to figure it out for themselves . <P> A ten-year veteran at 28 , Mantle should be in his peak years . He still has perhaps the highest potential in major-league history , and his past record is star caliber . But Mantle is wildly erratic . At his best , he hits home runs in fusillades-as he was doing last week . At his worst , he strikes out in dreary succession . For more than a year his bad days have outnumbered the good . <P> He has been plagued by physical injuries . His right knee is shot , his right shoulder is weak , he has had innumerable pulled , torn and twisted muscles . The knee bothers him most ; before every game , he binds his right leg from ankle to thigh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mantle . " It always feels like it will go out . " Says a rival American League manager : " When he swings , it looks like someone is sticking needles into that leg . " <P> But Mantle 's bad knee goes back to 1951 , and in 1956 he still led the league in batting ( .353 ) , home runs ( 52 ) and runs batted in ( 130 ) . In 1957 he hit .365 . Both years he was named the league 's most valuable player . <P> " I 'll Show You . " By general agreement of those who know him best , Mantle 's major problem is mental . He has never developed a pro 's poise to carry him through inevitable slumps . As a 19-year-old kid out of Commerce , Okla. , Mantle was bewildered by the big money and the big publicity that swamped him when he took over the job of Joe DiMaggio in the Yankees ' centerfield . Mantle is still a shy , stubborn introvert , who now manages to relax enough among teammates to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while injured . <P> But when Mantle 's game goes sour , he turns sullen in self-disgust . Says Cleveland General Manager Frank Lane : " Trouble with Mantle is , he 's fighting himself . He 'll go zero for three and then look miserable on a fly ball because he 's brooding . " When Mantle is down , the boos begin to rumble throughout Yankee Stadium even before he steps into the batter 's box . Mantle hears every catcall , fools no one when he shrugs : " These people do n't know what the hell they 're booing . " <P> " Mantle wants to be so great he can taste it , and it drives him nuts when he is n't , " says Jerry Coleman , the fine ex-Yankee second baseman who played with Mantle for seven years , roomed with him for two , and held a front-office job from 1957 to 1960 . " Mickey finds the booing terribly hard to take . He becomes defiant and throws bats and flips his helmet and bangs his fist into brick walls and kicks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think he gets so sore at himself and the fans who are on him he almost says , ' All right , I 'll show you . I 'll strike out a third time . ' And the worse things go , the more the fans get on Mickey , tak ing out their venom at the Yankees who had won so many years that people are fed up with them .
