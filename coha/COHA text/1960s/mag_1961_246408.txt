" One of the things about the presidency , " observed the smiling gentleman farmer , " is the way you have to be prepared to jump , just like a mountain sheep from one jag to another . " The speaker was in a position to know : he was Dwight Eisenhower in the retirement of his Gettysburg farm , talking for ten filmed hours with TV Newsman Walter Cronkite . Last week , marking Ike 's 71st birthday just after he had been given a high bill of health after a physical examination , CBS televised the first of three hour-long shows edited from the conversations . It provided some fascinating and meaningful footnotes to recent presidential history . Items : <P> ON HIS MOST PRIZED ACHIEVEMENT : " I tried to create an atmosphere of greater serenity and mutual confidence , and I think that this is noticeable . " <P> ON HIS DISAPPOINTMENTS : " The most important is the lack of definite proof that we have made real progress toward achieving peace with justice . " And : " One of my greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was highly qualified to take over the office of the presidency . " <P> ON LIMITED WAR : " People talk about small wars and big wars . Wellington said that no great country can have really a small war . Our needs for peace are such that no matter we see anything happen , we must regard it as a major war because it can easily become that . This business of differentiating so clearly between so-called small wars and a global war is not too clear to me .

" <P> ON McCARTHYISM : " Only the other day I ran into a memorandum I wrote to myself about April 1953 . In this memorandum I said : ' I have looked over this matter ever since it 's come to my attention , and I am convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ignore him . Never to admit that he has damaged me , upset me . ' As far as I can recall , I never mentioned his name , and I happen to know that this had a very great effect . "
