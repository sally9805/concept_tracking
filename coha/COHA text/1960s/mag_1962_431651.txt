 | They Fly The Queen No head of slate is more carefully guarded than . Queen Elizabeth when she takes to the air . On the ground she gives the orders , but once aloft her subjects take command / by Lawrence Lader As her Comet lifted smoothly off the ground at the Copenhagen airport iii October . 1960 . Queen Elizabeth II settled back in her seat . At last she could enjoy the brief respite between the round of ceremonial duties she had just left behind and the new ones she would face on landing in England . On the flight deck . the RAF pilots swung the plane onto its carefully plotted course . with the added security of knowing that all military , and commercial planes in the area had been warned to stay clear . Suddenly . over Holland . near the German-Dutch border . two Sabre jet fighters of the Vest German Air Force appeared out of nowhere . For a heart-stopping moment the three planes were on a dead collision course ; then the fighters turned and passed the transport a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an international crisis was averted . As it was , the incident , which occurred because by some slip-up the fighters had not been informed of the altitude of the Queen 's flight , caused an uproar in the British press and created serious tension between the two governments . Americans are often puzzled by the fuss the British make over the royal family . The Queen is not a political head of state like President Kennedy or Premier Khrushchev . She has little or no actual power ? " The Queen reigns hut does not rule . " However . she is an almost mystical symbol . a living link with the glories of the British past and the hopes of the future . Thus her every moment becomes of intense interest and concern to millions of people in the British Isles and overseas . The German incident ? the kind of emergency that can arise despite every precaution ? is the Queen 's only serious brush with disaster in her many hours in the air . thanks to the almost fanatical devotion of a small group of men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flies overseas . every one of them , from Sir Edward Heiden. captain of the Queen 's Flight , to the stewards and stewardesses. faces the endless challenge of making the Queen 's plane the safest in the world . The only planes permanently assigned to the Queen 's continued on page 170 @# 72  | Flight are a few small RAF models for use within the British Isles or on short hops overseas . Unlike the U.S. , which assigns an air force jet to the President for his exclusive use , the British government charters long-range planes when needed from the state-owned British Overseas Airways Corporation and British European Airways . The government pays for such charters , but this system still saves it money . To insure the Queen 's safety , BOAC will go to any lengths . During her sixweek tour of the Middle and Far East last year , an engineer was rushed from London to New Delhi to change a wiring loop in the undercarriage of the Queen 's Britannia simply because the undercarriage of a similar plane had caused trouble the day before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . On the same trip Captain Albert Meagher , the plane commander , was awakened at his hotel at 5:30 A.M. by a reporter who insisted that the plane had sprung a fuel leak . Meagher had only got to bed after checking the plane all evening , but he hurried to the airfield , to find that the " leak " was nothing but moisture , which the cold night air had caused to condense on the underside of the plane . " I did n't relish losing my sleep when I had to fly the next day , " says Meagher , " but you have to become a fanatic about details on this job . " To maintain its record of never being off schedule on a royal flight , BOAC rehearses each step of the trip months before . On Princess Margaret 's West Indian tour , for example , the crew made the actual trip in advance and went through the airfield reception ceremonies so efficiently , with a stewardess as Margaret 's stand-in , that the real ceremonies were only a few seconds longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , Captain Meagher brought his big BOAC Britannia carrying Queen Elizabeth II to a landing at Teheran airfield in Iran . assistant pilot , Captain Geoffrey Morre. counted off the seconds as they ta ' toward the headquarters building . H : . ! minute early because of favorable winds , Meagher checked the plane 's  - -  with his brakes . Prince Philip , who s : behind them on the flight deck , protest= jokingly that the pilots could never a .. themselves to be even a minute schedule . Meagher , agreeing with smile , continued braking the plane . At the scheduled second , the p stopped . The royal standard flutters. over the cockpit . The landing steps -A rushed to the cabin door , and the Qu and Prince descended to the red ca where the Shah led them to the ra ' dais at the edge of the field . At the e moment that the Queen reached throne on the dais , a dozen jet fight of the Iranian Air Force swooped over the field in a dazzling culminates of pageantry planned and timed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as closely as the Bank of Er land 's vaults by a force selected by security chiefs of BOAC and Buckingham Palace in co-operation with the cal police . At Addis Ababa a few years ago , Captain Meagher was met by lever bayonets when he tried to return to plane to prepare for a visit from : se ' Crown Prince of Ethiopia . Meagher i .. + helped post the guard only two hours fore . But neither his arguments nor the Prince 's moved the local gendarmerie. and Meagher finally had to summon : tee commander of the guard . All food for royal flights is prepared at BOAC 's headquarters under strict security control and rushed to the Queen 's plane in sealed containers . John Gorman BOAC 's sandy-haired , crisply efficient security chief , rides on the Queen 's plant and inspects the seals for tampering fore they are opened . During flights . the pilot and co-pilot eat a few hours apart so that any food poisoning , accidental or not , could not incapacitate both at : r same time . Sabotage is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was crack-pot telephone call during the Queen 's trip to New York in 1957 . All baggage going aboard the Queens plane , unless carried by members of the royal party , is rigorously inspected . A.-though the Queen continuously receives lavish and unique gifts on her tours , t o baby cheetahs , presented by one sultan last year , had to be tactfully refused Gorman was startled to be informed a little later , however , that an elephant was arriving at the air strip . ( It turned out to be a magnificent carving in silver . ) Whenever the Queen boards her plane , the BOAC Control Center notifies all countries and areas to be crossed in flight . In Great Britain the plane is routed along what is known as " purple airway , " from which all traffic in the vicinity is diverted . ON long over-water trips like the Atlantic crossing in 1957 , at least three Royal Navy ships are positioned between five permanently stationed weather ships so that the Queen 's plane is always within twenty minutes of help in case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survival kits fly parallel to the Queen 's in their respective sectors , in accordance with a schedule so carefully maintained that it rarely varies by more than a minute . The Queen 's plane and the attending craft report back constantly to the BOAC Control Center . The Queen 's most daring trip was a @#  | three-hour run along the Himalayan range last year ? so close " you could almost touch the mountains , " one crew member reported . The flight was suggested by Captain Meagher ; the Queen was delighted with the idea . Still , like all royal flight plans , it had to be cleared with Sir Edward Fielden . No amount of urging by the Queen could have overruled the decision of Sir Edward and his experts . The same principle applies to any decision in flight . For example , the Queen would never try to influence the plane commander in hastening a takeoff in had weather . " Inside the plane , " as Captain Rex Tapley puts it , " the captain 's word is law . " Like any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for takeoff and landing , and hears the regular lifebelt-inflation and ditching instructions . The Himalayan flight was touchy because no large plane like the Queen 's BOAC Britannia had ever skimmed Mt . Everest . The tension was increased by the fact that the boundary of communist Tibet bisects Everest . " My first problem , " says Captain Meagher , " was not to wander a foot off course ? there was always the chance communist planes would be patrolling the area . My second problem was the fierce winds off the Himalayas , at their worst near the tops of the peaks . " Since most of the major peaks are 26 , - 000 feet high , Meagher flew at 25,000 , giving the Queen a dazzling upward view . At Everest 's 29,000-foot peak , he rose to 28,000 . He crisscrossed back and forth about ten minutes , taking the plane off automatic pilot and flying manually to give himself instantaneous control . He had to be particularly wary of up-anddown currents and always kept a valley route open in case the plane was caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not the slightest turbulence and no sign of Chinese patrol planes . " Royal luck at its best , " Meagher calls it . The Queen and Prince , both ardent photographers , were at lunch when their plane approached the Himalayas . They left the table , seized their cameras and rushed from window to window as one shot more spectacular than the last burst into range . At Everest they were delighted to find the route that Sir John Hunt had taken up the slopes . They searched excitedly for the flagpole Sir Edmund Hillary had planted on the peak , but found no sign of it . They shot hundreds of pictures in those few hours until the floor was littered with empty film packs and cartons . " They were like enraptured children before a Christmas tree , " recalls one steward . The vast fortune in jewelry on the royal plane places a tremendous responsibility on BOAC security chief Gorman and Chief Superintendent Albert Perkins , the Queen 's personal security officer . Gorman supervises the jewelry on the plane and airstrip . Perkins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any earl and is easily the bestdressed detective in the world , hovers discreetly near the Queen from the moment she leaves the plane till her last good-night at state banquets . The Queen makes her own choice of jewels . For the Indian trip . for example , she took , among others , three favorite pieces the famous " Russian tiara " ; the so-called " interchangeable tiara " worn with either pearls or emeralds ; and " Queen Mary 's tiara " with pearls at the top of each spike . The secret of Gorman 's security system is that this priceless hoard travels on the plane as inconspicuously as possible . No safe holds the tiaras . No armed guard stands over a steel box . Gorman himself does not know which members of the Queen 's intimate staff a : ' e carrying the jewels . His business is merely to see that each piece of luggage that came onto the plane gets safely off . The amount of luggage on last year 's Middle East tour ? estimated at a hundred pieces ? presented Gorman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six feet high with " E II R " embossed on its side , is lashed down in the forward cabin . Less-important luggage , as well as staff assistants and secretaries , travel on a second plane . At each stop Gorman must get the royal luggage from the plane to the Queen 's residence in less than an hour . The wardrobe trunk , always carried upright , must be squeezed through the cabin do or and eased gently down the plane steps by local porters . They are often so fascinated by the Queen 's appearance and the splendor of the reception ceremonies that Gorman has to urge them on by tackling the luggage himself . ( Lifting a bag to the van at one Indian airfield , Gorman was almost scalped by a swinging door and had to wear his head in bandages the rest of the trip . ) Neither Gorman nor Perkins takes more than a handful of assistants on royal trips . They depend instead on prearranged co-operation with local police forces , whose enthusiasm occasionally produces quaint results . At one Middle East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outnumbered by n swarm of beggars , obviously detectives , valiantly trying to blend into the scenery . At Ankara . Turkey , the last stop on the 1950 tour , the Queen was making her last farewells at the airfield when more than two dozen enthusiastic press photogra   phers pressed so closely around her that they began forcing her backward from the steps of the plane . Gorman , Perkins and their aides quickly formed a cordon around the Queen . Prince Philip , however , moved even more decisively . Already on the steps of the plane , he rushed forward to take the Queen 's arm . Bantering good-naturedly with the photographers , he cleared a path through them and hustled his wife to the cabin door . The Queen herself has solved similar crises with diplomatic ingenuity . On last year 's tour , the airfield at Quetta was so fog-laden on the Saturday of her scheduled flight that the Pakistan government insisted the visit be cancelled . When the Queen learned , however , that thousands of villagers had already come by oxcart and foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced she would fly up on Sunday when the weather cleared , oven though it meant giving up her one clay of rest in a hectic schedule . " It was titter cold ? 1 could n't have stood at the infield for ten minutes , " recalls William Homing , the chief steward . " But people : . ad been waiting all morning , waving little Union Jacks they 'd dug up somehere . The Queen was so touched she relayed the official reception half an our while she went around shaking ands in the icy wind . " At one African city , where animosity against the British government had preeded her visit , the Queen delighted her elcoming committee of local chiefs in leopard skins , ostrich-feather headTresses and gleaming brass bangles by . tearing an outfit that almost matched their own in flaming color . At New Delhi she appeared in an ice-blue satin coat , split up one side in Eastern style . At Ankara the Queen greeted her military guard of honor at the airfield with the traditional salute of an officer to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back happily , " Sagol ! ( May you live long ! ) " " None of her pictures do her justice , " says stewardess Joy Henderson . " The flashing smile in photographs is even lovelier in real life . Her complexion is miraculous . She always seems calm and unruffled . She remains regal , even a trifle remote , but she 's so informal , so easy to serve that you almost forget she 's the Queen . At meals , she 's gay and vivacious , taking part in every conversation . She and the Prince like to help themselves at a buffet . Often she asks to pour tea . " The Queen is actually fond of flying . No member of the cabin staff recalls ever having given her an airsick remedy . In fact , accustomed since girlhood to frequent short flights throughout the British Isles on small , unpressurized planes , she finds jet travel a delightful contrast . The Prince , being a veteran pilot , looks forward to every minute in the air . In the almost mechanized complexity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small touches of personal consideration . " She would sit down as quickly as possible with an older person like Mr. Nehru so as not to keep him standing , " recalls Captain Morrell . " The Queen has the knack of remembering you at the perfect moment , " says Meagher . " At New Delhi airfield with Mr. Nehru and every top official greeting her , and a swarm of reporters around her , she still turned in her car as the flight crew stood at the top of the plane steps and gave us that warm , wonderful smile . " The Queen fusses far more over the flight crew than herself . " At Peshawar , Pakistan , when the temperature suddenly fell below freezing , " recalls stewardess @# Ethel Hunter , " the Queen immediately asked me whether we had enough warm clothes with us . " Often during the trip she would ask the pilots if they were getting enough sleep . Stewardesses are instructed to curtsy to the Queen at their first meeting each morning . But on my first morning , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Henderson . " I just stood there paralyzed . Then the Queen gave me one beautiful smile , and I knew that everything was fine . " Even on her most tragic flight , returning hastily from Africa in 1952 after the death of her father , King George VI , ( the news was broken to her gently by Philip , in a tree-top observation post in Kenya ) , the Queen took time to autograph pictures for each staff member of the Royal Lodge at Kenya . At London airport , after Prime Minister Churchill and other government leaders had expressed their condolences , the Queen walked over to the plane crew and thanked them for their help . One secret of the Queen 's stamina is her tranquillity , inherited in large part from the Queen Mother . Through selfdiscipline , she has also learned to conserve her strength on the plane , falling asleep almost instantly at night and taking quick catnaps during the day . Part of the time in flight she works on official papers . Other times she answers personal letters , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in New Delhi on Prince Andrew 's first birthday , called him on the radio-telephone . " But mainly the Queen and Prince use these plane trips as rare moments of complete isolation from the pressure of their duties , " says Captain Meagher . Alone in their private cabin . they stretch out and take their shoes off . The Queen continued on puge L77  | does at least one crossword puzzle a day and reads newspapers and magazines from all over the world omnivorously . They enjoy company at meals and always invite at least two of their staff to join them . The Prince , in particular , prefers informality on the plane . " He does n't want fuss and bother around him , often mixing his own drinks at the bar , " says Heming . In fact , neither the Queen nor Prince , according to their cabin staff , have ever rung the bell for service . Although the Queen 's informal conversations with the cabin staff are generally limited to compliments on the dinner or discussions of the weather at the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside her private quarters . " At Cyprus near the end of last ear 's tour , " recalls Miss Hunter , " she walked into the forward cabin and asked us what we had enjoyed most during the trip . " The Prince is apt to talk with the staff about specific details . " He liked to watch us at work in the galley , " says Heming . " He appreciates efficiency , and he 'd often tell us how amazed he was we could produce such complex meals from such a tiny galley . " Other members of the royal family are equally informal . " When I flew Princess Alexandra to Nigeria in 1960 , almost immediately she asked me to sit down and have a cup of coffee with her , " reports Captain Tapley . On another royal flight one steward recalls a hectic meal when the luncheon dishes were stacked high in his overcrowded pantry and a hand suddenly appeared bearing another pile of dishes . " Oh , pass them along , " he growled , only to glance up a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly qualified pilot , Prince Philip spends every spare moment on the flight deck , almost never missing a takeoff or landing . On one tour of India without the Queen , he piloted his BOAC Comet IV jet-liner from takeoff to 30,000 feet on three different occasions . On last year 's tour with the Queen , he became so fascinated with the extraordinarily tricky turn that Captain Meagher had to make in parking that he was almost late appearing at the cabin door with Her Majesty for the welcoming ceremonies . In Iran he hurried the Shah , also an expert pilot right to the flight deck , and they tested themselves on a continuing series of sharper and sharper turns , only letting - so when they feared they were disturb. g the comfort of the Queen and other passengers . wHEN the Prince was returning in his small plane to meet the Queen 's Britannia at an Indian airfield last year , he decided to replace Squadron Leader Hannah , his pilot , at the controls . " Despite a nasty cross-wind , " Meagher relates , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best in the comany of pilots . " He likes to be treated like any other pilot , " says Meagher . Par:cularly on RAF flights , when he spends most of his time in the cockpit , the Prince shares coffee and snacks with the sew . He often ignores protocol when lying alone , once appearing on the flight leek in sailing shorts after returning - mm a yachting trip . He has a wide grasp of scientific matters and can converse with the pilots easily in technical jargon . He likes the relaxed humor of their world and has a wide repertoire of stories himself . Still , no matter how relaxed he may be at most times , everyone recognizes that he demands prompt compli.nce with his requests . " When the Prince says ' Lunch at one , ' " says one steward . " you 'd better be sure to have the meal ready on the second . " BEHIND each royal tour lies such a maze of detail that BOAC headquarters has to compile a book of hundreds of pages to consolidate its planning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOAC of the dates , schedule and countries to be visited . A plane suited to these requirements is withdrawn from regular service a week before flight-time , locked away in a special hangar , overhauled , and put through its final check-flights . The plane is redone inside with special equipment and upholstery kept by BOAC for royal flights . The Britaaina 312 used last year , for example , contained a large , private royal compartment in the rear with divans converting to beds at night , carpets in rich blue and walls in gray tweed . The next compartment is the royal lounge and bar with a circular couch and a dining table seating eight . Then comes a section for the royal party with twelve or more deluxe sleeping chairs , followed by the staff compartment and finally the wardrobe and trunk room . Special silver and china is maintained by BOAC for the Queen . But unlike the President 's plane , often filled with luxurious personalized gifts from friends , the Queen 's table settings and linen are surprisingly simple . No higher accolade can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to he selected for a royal flight . The choice is made by BOAC executives on the basis of records and experience . Captain Meagher , who is forty , won the Distinguished Flying Cross and bar and the Distinguished Flying Medal for fifty missions over Germany with the RAF Bomber Command during World War II . and has flown 11,000 hours for BOAC . Captain E. E. Rodley. 47 , who won the Distinguished Service Order and DFC and bar in the war , was the first . pilot in the world to have a commercial license endorsed for pure jet passenger aircraft and played a key role in BOAC 's pioneering work with jets . Captain James T. Percy . 52 , a pilot since 1932 , flew the Atlantic ferry service during the war and commanded the plane which took Sir Winston Churchill to the Bermuda " Big Three " meeting in 1953 . Most stewardesses chosen for royal flights are nurses . Ethel Hunter , for example , who has made 500 Atlantic crossings , was a state registered nurse before joining BOAC in 1950 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitals before going to BOAC . The cabin crew starts special training long before flight time . Stewardesses must pass rigid medical and security exams , and they are inculcated with a detailed knowledge of royal preferences in everything from food to reading matter . They practice serving at table , making beds and other duties on an exact replica of the Queen 's plane . They are even sent to one of London 's most fashionable " grooming schools , " where their curtsy , posture and makeup are perfected . Months before the tour , pilots like Meagher and Morrell make a preliminary survey of the many airfields where the Queen will land . One landing strip on last year 's tour , used mainly as a cow pasture since World War II , had to he fenced off and cleaned . At Chittagong , Pakistan , the runways had been under eight feet of water a few months before as a result of a cyclone . At BangaloreIndia , the strip was not wide enough to @#  | allow the Britannia to " corner " at the bends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airfield in the Himalayas , where they could only land in a small RAF Heron , tie strip was a dirt path . A bullock ambled across it as they came in . Group Captain James Jeffs , the ebullient BOAC " advance man , " not only takes care of technical problems at fields where modern communications and landing equipment must be installed , but soothes over diplomatic irritants . The sewers along the route to be taken by the Queen in one town were so pungent that Jeffs used subtle persuasion to get them sprayed with kerosene . In another city , Jeffs managed a minor miracle by clearing the streets of sacred cows which usually dozed along the route of the Queen 's procession . The planning of menus starts months before each tour . Edward W. Belcher. @# BOAC 's cabin services manager , keeps a complex card file of the food preferences of the whole royal family . The dishes he plans to serve are submitted to Buckingham Palace . for approval , organized into menus and submitted again to the Palace . A typical luncheon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salmon , grilled filet of beef with mushrooms , French beans and French fried potatoes , cheese and souffle . A few specialties are prepared locally . At Karachi last year , BOAC 's local chef made an Indian curry , a favorite of the royal couple . At Bombay , the stewards served " dabs , " large coconuts from which the milk is drunk through straws . " The Queen likes simple food without heavy sauces , " says Belcher . Among her favorite dishes are steak , pheasant , partridge , cold ham , roast beef , green salad with tomatoes , cucumbers and French dressing , and Cheddar cheese at the end of a meal . A particular favorite is salmon and caviar , and she is likely to ignore the rest of the menu for them . She likes her tea without sugar . Wine and coffee are generally served only when guests are present . The Prince eats far more heartily , fa- voring pate de foie Bras , filet mignon , and cheeses . He drinks vodka , beer . screwdrivers ( vodka and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also occasionally sips . Neither the Queen nor Prince smoke , but BOAC keeps a prized silver cigarette box in the royal lounge on which is inscribed the date and destination of all royal flights . Since both the Queen and Prince love dowers , carnations are always supplied male members of the royal party . Rosebuds are placed in all napkins at meals . At Madras on last year 's tour , flowers grew in such profusion around the airport that the cabin staff simply went out and picked them for the plane . One special touch was added to the royal stateroom last year for the Himalayan flight : pictures of Mt . Everest so rare they could be secured only from the Indian Air Force and Sir John Hunt 's expedition . Possibly nothing equals the complexity of preparing the Queen 's wardrobe for each tour . Miss Margaret " Bobo " MacDonald , the Queen 's personal maid and confidante , an amiable , auburn-haired Scotswoman who was an undernurse at the Palace during Elizabeth 's infancy , packs and supervises all her clothes . She also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Queen boards the plane in , say , an elaborate ball gown with tulle train as she did in New York in 1957 . Although BOAC stocks the royal compartment with all beauty accessories , Miss MacDonald carries the Queen 's own makeup kit . The court hairdresser , usually Mr. Henry Joerin of the salon " Emile , " generally rides on the second plane . A SIX-WEEK tour often involves over sixty new changes of costume for the Queen , for the British have become so accustomed to the magnificence of her wardrobe that the press often comments when she wears the same dress twice . Her clothes , designed generally by Norman Hartnell and Hardy Amies , the London couturiers , may require a month of afternoons for selection of models , materials and eventual fittings . The plane staffs are constantly amazed at this seemingly endless array of clothes . In six weeks we never saw Her Majesty in the same dress twice , " reports Captain Meagher . " Just when we thought she had run out of colors , she started on checks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since weather conditions vary drastically between stops ( 70 degrees at Peshawar on the last trip , for example , and 33 with snow at Quetta only a few hours later ) , they send weather reports to the royal cabin in the last hour before landing . No one appreciates more the staggering amount of planning and ceaseless care that goes into every detail of her flights than the Queen . As they were nearing London at the end of their sixweek tour last year , she called John Gorman and Douglas Buchanan of Security and Captains Meagher and Morrell to her cabin . The stewards had already been given gold cuff links , the stewardesses monogrammed brooches . " I thought we might be given a small remembrance , " Meagher recalls . Instead , from their boxes the Queen drew forth three high awards she bestows by personal favor . To Gorman and Meagher she presented the order of Commander of the Royal Victorian Order ; to Morrell and Buchanan membership in the order . " As I bowed and left the cabin , " Meagher said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful trip ! ' I muttered a silent prayer that we could always keep them that way . "
