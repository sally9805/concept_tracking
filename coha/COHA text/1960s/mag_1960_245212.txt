A EUROPEAN EDUCATION ( 248 pp. ) - Romain Gary-Simon &; Schuster ( $3.75 ) . <P> <P> French Novelist Romain Gary has created a gallery of heroes who are willing to die for liberty but have to settle for the lesser victory of self-knowledge . Whether they enter the lists on the side of justice and liberty ( The Colors of the Day ) or fanatically defend so unlikely a symbol of freedom as the disappearing elephant ( The Roots of Heaven ) , they wind up knowing that man 's nature itself precludes the achievement of worldly grace . A courageous fighter himself ( in the French and Free French air forces for eight years ) . Gary saves his writing from downright pessimism by the conviction that the idealists will always continue the struggle through some inner human compulsion . <P> The latest of Gary 's books to appear in the U.S. is actually the second book he wrote , was published in France . Its heroes are the partisans of Poland during the Nazi occupation ; and even now . after shelves have been jammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its horror and its message with stubborn authority . Author Gary ( for the past four years French consul general in Los Angeles ) is a French citizen born of Russian actor parents . As a boy he went to school for a year or two in Poland , speaks its language and understands its plight . His hero is a boy of 14 who is led into a forest by his doctor father and left with a supply of potatoes in a dugout . His mother has been taken to one of the brothels set up by the Germans , and it is a long time before Janek knows that his father was killed when , alone , he attacked her keepers . <P> <P> Like many a wartime child in whatever country , Janek becomes a man long before he stops being a boy . He learns about bravery and suffering before he can comprehend their motivation . His first and only love affair is with a girl not much older than he who is both a prostitute for the German troops and a spy for the partisans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black-market game , digs for acorns in the snow when the last potato is gone . And all the time he remains in part a baffled child who avidly reads about American Indians . He also learns to kill . But not even his patriotism and his hatred of the enemy can protect him from the shame he feels when he shoots a German soldier who is sitting down , unarmed . <P> Janek 's hope , like the hope of many another innocent , is that Russia and the U.S. , as victors , would " build a new world together . " But already some know better . " You are such a child , Janek , " says his child-mistress . <P> Author Gary 's writing success , in a book from which the years have extracted some force , lies in the fact that the heroism swamps the despair . The ultimate lesson of this bitter European education is that , in Gary 's words , " we still are , and will be for a long time , condemned to heroism . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
