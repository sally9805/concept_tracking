You 're a walking daydream . " So she is . She writes herself letters at work ( " Dear Madame : Hi " ) , puts them in her In basket ( " Oh , look , a letter for me " ) and answers them ( " Dear Madame : Hi . Glorious morning , is n't it ? " ) . She plays games with herself such as How Can That Be ? , in which she makes up an impossible situation , asks herself " How can that be ? " and is disappointed if she can not concoct a way it could be . She is unable to explain , for instance , why " an upside-down-speedboat made of rose petals was in orbit around the moon .
