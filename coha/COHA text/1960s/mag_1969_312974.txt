THEY are the descendants of Jacksonian America . Once they were the heroes of the American democratic my thology . Walt Whitman catalogued them . Carl Sandburg cel ebrated them . " The people will live on , " he wrote - mean ing the workers , the " common man " in a slightly nostalgic sense , the people nowadays referred to as the lower middle class . The traditional American values and ambitions sus tained them . Today , those virtues seem to many to be mocked and perverted . The white lower middle class feels dan gerously ignored , as outdated as Norman Rockwell 's folksy icons . With justice , Richard Nixon calls them " forgotten Americans . " <P> They live in overmortgaged , underserviced blue-collar ghet tos where they pay a stiffer price - in poor schools , en croaching throughways and war casualties - than do affluent whites across the city lines . Most of them still believe in God , country , the work ethic and a sexual standard that calls for at least a decent public restraint . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves as the last defenders of moral authority . That is why they still admire the military and regard the police as heroes . The New York Times 's Tom Wicker had a revelation at the Chicago convention : " These were our children in the streets and the Chi cago police beat them up . " The Gallup poll recorded that 56% of the people interviewed approved of the Chicago cops . What those people meant was : " Those were our chil dren who were doing the beating . " They also meant that their view of themselves as a last moral bastion has become ever more frustrating . Lower-middle-class Americans read of millionaires who pay no taxes . The clergymen whom they value lead open-housing demonstrations . They dream of sending their children to college , but the universities have become battlegrounds for black militants and white rad icals . Their bumper stickers suggest an apprehensive kind of jingoism ( REMEMBER THE PUEBLO ) , and the decal Amer ican flags on their car windows bespeak a defensive patri otism ( THESE COLORS DO NOT RUN ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're trying to teach your chil dren one set of values and every element of life around them shows you up as a square , " laments Elaine Whitehead , a telegrapher in Bellingham , Wash . " Sometimes I feel like grabbing a burro and gold pan , packing up my family and heading for the hills . " <P> Call It Hate Economically , they are the " marginal " whites who earn be tween $5,000 and $10,000 a year and represent 40% of American families . They are factory workers , storekeepers , small farmers , cab drivers , policemen , firemen , longshoremen , post al clerks , many public school teachers - and a number of the elderly . In theory , they have never been so prosperous . <P> Yet the median U.S. family income is still only $7,974 a year . According to the Labor Department , an urban family maintains a " poor " standard of living at $5,915 a year , while a " moderate " standard of living requires $9,076.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
