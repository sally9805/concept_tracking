" A good Englishman never jokes when so serious a matter as a wager is in question , " replied Phileas Fogg . <P> - Jules Verne : Around the World in 80 Days It was enough to titillate the great storyteller 's ghost . The wackiest ocean race of all time , it started in a cozy English club , the consequence of a five-bob ( 70 ) wager between a balding ex-commando and a bespectacled manufacturer of pocket maps . The wager made , War Hero H. G. ( " Blondie " ) Hasler and Mapmaker Francis Chichester approached the prestigious Royal Western Yacht Club for official sanction . Their casual proposition : to sail the perilous Atlantic , from Plymouth to New York , into the teeth of the prevailing westerlies - one lone man to a boat . <P> Under the rules no handicaps would be granted , and the course would be left to choice . Auxiliary engines were not to be used , and contestants would solemnly swear to take aboard no supplies during the crossing . The club , somewhat surprisingly , approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far away as California , and hungry would-be sponsors clamored for a slice of the publicity pie . RCA offered radios , Autolite supplied batteries , and Plymouth Gin solicitously insisted on stocking each boat with a " survival kit " - one part gin , one part vermouth , and a guide to martini mixing . <P> Recorders &; Cummerbunds .

Asked to name his chief hazard , Chichester replied : " Being run down by an ocean liner . " <P> Voices in the Night . On his 40-day , 4,000-mile journey , Chichester not only missed being run down ; he saw only three other ships . Once a Russian tanker , jammed with radar gear , circled him cautiously , apparently decided he was not a Polaris sub , and steamed away . One dusk , said Chichester , " I thought I heard voices . I poked my head out of the cabin . Alongside was a freighter ; people were sitting on the bridge , having evening drinks . " Battered by huge waves , isolated by fog , Chichester slept only four to six hours a night , fought his loneliness by writing a 75,000-word diary , disdained a prescribed daily log ( sample question : " Happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chichester accepted the risk of icebergs and storms , gambled on a northerly course along the comparatively short Great Circle route .
