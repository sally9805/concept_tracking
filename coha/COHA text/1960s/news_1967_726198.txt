txt The Ford Foundation said yesterday that it plans to cut its spending . Colleges and universities , which have been getting a substantial share of the foundation 's grants , will be hardest hit by the cuts . The economics are designed to bring the foundation 's spending more nearly in line with . the income from its investments . At the same time , Bundy , president of the foundation , severely criticized " the American rich  --  old and new " for their " relatively slow and feeble giving " to education and chided the universities themselves for what he called timid and inexpert investing of their endowments . In his first annual reportl since he assumed the presidency of the nation 's largest foundation , with assets of $2.4-billion , Mr. Bundy gave notice of sweeping changes in goals and attitudes in foundation grants . In his review of the foundation 's fiscal year , which ended last Sept. 30 , Mr. Bundy indicated that grants totaling // $307.7-million were made , compared with an income of $157.4-million , The year'sactivities brought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foundation in 1936 to $1-billion . Program payments in the same period have amounted to $2.5-billion . He did not say how much the foundation 's grants would be reduced , but added , that it would continue to spend someWhat beyond its income . Mr. Bundy called for a nationwide review and analysis of the effectiveness with which university trustees invest their institutions ' endowments . Noting that higher education had only four major sources of future support  --  tuition , Federal funds , private gifts and improved management of endowment funds ? Mr. Bundy reserved his most direct criticism for the universities ' own financial practices . " We recognize the risk of unConventional investing , " he said , " but the true test of performance in the handling of money is the record of achievement , not the opinion of the respectable . " He added that he suspected that " caution has cost our colleges and universities much more than imprudence or excessive risk-taking . " Improvement by merely one per cent in the annual return on private higher education 's total endowment of $2-billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Urges More Private Gifts Mr. Bundy said that private contributions to higher education  --  which are now threeand-a-half times what they were 15 years ago  --  should be five times what they are now . " Where are the modern Andrew Carnegies  --  the men who will do more than all their friends expect ? " he asked . He urged an increase of Federal support , beyond the present $4-billion a year , and charged that higher education has been " a shads slow " in creating public understanding of this need . Mr. Bundy charged that American businesses , professions and government give little encouragement to the initiative of the young , and warned against " the growing menace " of cautious men who are unwilling " to annoy " their organizations by proposing change and of organizations " too easily annoyed . " He sharply criticized the growing " public blandness " and pledged ' the foundation 's " stand against this kind of thing . " ' Without directly alluding to frequent . past criticisms of the foundation 's alleged aversion to controversy , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have learned in this year is that we have no warrant to be mute when there  --  comes a time to speak  --  a time to put our mouth where our money is . We Intend to be careful and responsible in what we say , but we find no virtue in a vow of silence . " Criticism Called . Mr. Bundy 's 10-page , policy statement entitled " Public Issues ; - Philanthropic . Foundations ; and Straight Talk , " dealt with issues ranging from educational television to international peace . He insisted that " to ' be exposed to analysis and criticism " is good for all public institutions , from commercial television to ... the foundations themselvei . " Tbe , best-run outfits , ' on the who/t , are the ones which are moseopen , " he said . But while , he promised mt .. , port to the unorthodox , he added that " merely to be peculiar is not sufficient ground for successful application " for funds . The noncontroversial support ? of " research in rice " remains important , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandon such solid work because it is safe as it would be timid to limit ourselves to such work exclusively . " While the foundation does not confuse itself with the Federal Government or with the United Nations , he said , " where we see a chance to do more for peace , we will . " But the major thrust of the policy statement dealt with the economic crisis of higher education . He expressed concern that academic presidents and deans , if hard-pressed for funds , will neglect innovation and reform . " The great academic leaders have always had entrepreneurial energy , and the president 's chair has never been a good scat for a man of purely philosophical temper , " he said . " Yet , the president as promoter is only a part of what an institution needs , " he added . He charged that men with " high intellectual command of the old and new issues of academic life " are rare , partly because " the best of them will reject the hard life of high-energy salesmanship which a college presidency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he warned that " there Is no solution to the problems of the private colleges and universities in simply giving away the Ford Foundation . " Recalling his own days as dean at Harvard University , before he became a special adviser to President Kennedy and President Johnson , he said he understood well that many academic leaders feel they need the foundation 's capital " more than we do . " But he added , . higher education 's needs could easily absorb three times the Ford Foundation 's endowment , " I joke in order not to cry , " he added . But he nevertheless indicated that the recent $35-million grant to Columbia ' University , the latest in a six-year series of special grants to colleges and universities totaling $325-million , may have signaled the start of a reduction of this type of support . He pointed to " a special obligation " to help put the urban universities " at the forefront of intelligent concern for the interlocking problems of the city and the Negro . " " The past record of our universities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While citing California as an example of public support of higher education , Mr. Bundy , in an oblique reference to Governor Ronald Reitgan 's conflict with the University of CalifoN nia and the activities of some leftwing student ; groups , said " It is hardly thinkable that the excesses or vindictiveness of a few at either extreme should be allowed to da any lasting darn- ; age to ) the magnificent partnership batvieen the people of ' California and their great university . " It is not unsual for foundations to spend more than their income , especially in a time of rising stock market values , In such a period , even if the spending exceeds the return on the investment , the foundations ' total assets , according to the market value of their investment endowment , tends to increase . This has been the case with the ' Ford Foundation 's endowment . However , Mr. Bundy 's call for a review of investment policies takes account of the fact that institutional investors , such as boards of trustees , are said to err frequently on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth of their institution 's total capital . He conceded the foundation itself might be liable to criticism on these grounds . The categories of common stocks in which the foundation indicated the highest amounts of investments were oil and gas , utilities , chemicals and consumer goods .
