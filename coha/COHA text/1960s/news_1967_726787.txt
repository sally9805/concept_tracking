txt The 1967 session of Congress will end this week if members can settle disputes over proposed changes in the welfare laws and how deeply to slash President Johnson 's antipoverty and foreign aid appropriation requests . Democratic leaders hope to adjourn the first session ' of the 90th Congress on Friday or Saturday , postponing until next year action on a wide range of legislation that the Administration has termed vital . The plan is to take a onemonth vacation , until Jan. 15 , before beginning the second session in which the Administration must resume its efforts to salvage a respectable portion of the President 's 1967 legislative request as well ' as to work for the additional requests that he will make next year . DeadIpcks Possible Only the possibility of deadlocks on the welfare changes and on the appropriation bills , it was believed , could delay adjournment . These remaining disputes were characteristic of the 1967 session , which has provided all that the President requested to fight the war in Vietnam but has held the line on spending for social programs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bill , approved by a House-Senate conference committee Thursday , to increase Social Security benefits . A group of liberal Senators charged that the changes 4 , vould " punish the poor " and said they would ask the Senate to reject ' the measure . They objected particularly to proposals inserted in the bill by the House Ways and Means Committee to freeze the num // ber of children In each state whose welfare payments could be financed by the Federal Government and to establish new procedures to force welfare recipients to find jobs . Albert J. Zack of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations announced tonight that the federation had decided to wage an all-out fight against the conference version of the Social Security bill . Mr. Zack , public relations director of the federation , said that the organization would push in the Senate for a more liberal bill . He added that the federation , now in convention at Bal Harbour , Fla. made the decision tonight and would conduct the campaign regardless of what position the Johnson Administration took . Compromise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely varying appropriation bills approved by the House and Senate . The Senate on Thursday voted $2.73-billion for the current fiscal year , $520-million below the President 's request but $534-million above the House appropriation . Some Congressional sources said tonight that a foreign aid compromise might be difficult to reach . There were indications , for example , that many House members were unwilling to split the monetary difference between the House and Senate versions of the measure . In the past , such splits have often been agreed upon with little difficulty . The House is expected to approve on Monday a conference committee report , accepted by the Senate Friday , to continue the antipoverty authorization at $1.98-billion for the current year . This must be followed , however , by the appropriation bill for antipoverty . The Senate is expected to push for a figure near the $1.98-billion authorization , but the House is likely to vote much less . President Johnson asked for $2.06-billion . Mahon 's Prediction George H. Mahon of Texas , chairman of the House Appropriations Committee , has said that $1.6-billion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though Sargent Shriver , antipoverty director , has said that $1.788-billion is needed to keep present programs going . The Senate returns Monday to the House-passed bill to continue for three more years , at a cost of $14.2-billion , aid to elementary and secondary education . A dispute over civil rights issues has kept it from passing . This , however , is not standing in the way of adjournment because the school authorization and appropriation for this year have already been approved . The bill under consideration is tor a period beginning with the next fiscal year on July 1 and thus could be carried over without disrupting the program .. A number of important bills have been cleared in the last few days . A consumer measure calling for stricter meat inspection was sent to the White House Wednesday . Bills to increase the postal rates and give pay rises to military and civil service personnel were considered certain to be given final approval early in the week . Also expected to be approved is a measure putting into law the budget trimming agreement worked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution providing emergency pay for some agencies , it would specify a cut in spending at about $4-billion below the executive budget for the current fiscal year . Tax Rise Carried Over The most important measure being carried over until next year is the 10 per cent tax increase requested by President Johnson as a means of curbing , inflation , stabilizing the international monetary system and reducing the deficit for the year . The House Ways and Means Committee suspended action on the tax bill in October and still , refused to vote it out this year when President Johnson agreed to cut spending by $4-billion . The chairman , Wilbur D. Mills , Democrat of Arkansas , has indicated . that its success next year will depend on the kind of budget for the fiscal year 1969 that the President submits in February . Also carried ova . until next year are important Administration bills on crime prevention , civil rights , higher education , highway beautification , conservation and consumer protection .                 @ @ @ @
