The student is in his third year at Gordonstoun School in northern Scotland , and he seems to be standing up well enough to the Spartan regime that begins at 6:45 a.m. with a brisk run on a gravel road followed by hot and cold showers . Though neither an outstanding student nor athlete , he mixes well , and his public image is that of a healthy boy with a mop of hair that defies comb and brush . When it was suggested that he has a Beatle 's haircut , His Royal Highness Charles Philip Arthur George , heir apparent to the British throne , grinned and said , " You mean the Beatles have a Prince Charles cut . " <P> <P> One thing Charles consistently shares with his classmates is an inability to make do on his allowance , which runs to about $8.50 per term ( twelve weeks ) , and last week the prince 's pauperized condition brought him considerable notoriety . <P> Broken English . At an earlier school , he had made rather a good thing of selling his autograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop to it and returned the money . According to newspaper reports , when Prince Charles ran short last December , he sold his composition book containing four school-assigned essays to a classmate for $4 . Gordonstoun 's Headmaster Robert Chew says there is " absolutely no truth " to the report . But the classmate did get the copybook and sold it for $20 to a Gordonstoun alumnus who did even better by selling it to an Aberdeen journalist for $280 , who then joined forces with a press-agent named Terence Smith . <P> Among others , Smith conferred with a photographer friend as to the best means of making big money from the princely essays . British publications were out because of an unwritten agreement with the crown to ignore the private lives of the royal children . Smith sent cables to U.S. and European publications . He got a quick telephone response from two men speaking broken English who claimed to be representatives of France 's Le Figaro . Smith met with them at a lonely spot outside London , and when he showed them the royal jottings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confiscated the book . They did not know that Smith 's photographer friend had made a photocopy just in case . <P> <P> Deplored Habit . Ultimately the Smith syndicate made a deal with the German magazine Der Stern , which obtained first publication rights for some $3,500 , and other sales abroad brought the total above $12,000 . Der Stern last week published excerpts from the essays , which sounded pretty much like the sort of thing most fond parents of teen-agers are familiar with . But there was a special approach to some subject matter . Writing on democracy , the prince noted a little uneasily that it means giving " equal voting power to people haying unequal ability to think . " He also deplored the habit of voting " for a particular party and not for the individual . " Mere opposition to abolishing private schools or nationalizing industry might induce people to vote for a Conservative candidate , though personally he might be " one of the naughtiest people you know .
