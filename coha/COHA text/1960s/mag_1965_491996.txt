The masquerade of a counterfeit doctor For seven years he haunted medical schools and hospitals , surreptitiously acquiring a medical education  --  but never a diploma . Except for a bad break , he mi:ht still be practicing medicine . By Bard Lindeman he elevator doors slid open and tall , boyish-looking Thomas M. Novak stepped out onto the fifth floor of Detroit police headquarters with his pretty wife Pat , eight months pregnant with their third child , holding onto his arm . Together they began to push slowly through the crowd of reporters , photographers and television newsmen mast of whom were now shouting questions : " Did you know all along you 'd be caught , Novak ? " " Hey , can we get a shot of you two kissing ? " " Will you stand by your husband . Mrs. Novak ? " Ashamed , confused and suddenly angered , Novak looked up and said sharply , " My God , you 'd think I was John Dillinger . " There were , at this moment , some people in Michigan who believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were more who knew the soft-spoken , 29-year-old man as their family doctor . For four years they had trusted him with the care of their children or COUNTERFEIT DOCTOR their elderly parents . Then , on September 2. 1964 , " Doctor Tom " was exposed as a skillful masquerader , a man who had no license to practice medicine . The unmasking of the " do-it-yourself physican " sent the medical world into a small panic . Michigan Attorney General Frank J. Kelly declared , " The shocking and incredible Novak case is the most fantastic incidence of deception in Michigan 's history . " Tom Novak believes there was " something in my genes or cells which dictated 1 be a doctor . " As a boy , he remembers how he was fascinated by the world of medicine . He recalls listening with his mother to the radio serial , Doctor Christian . He remembers when he had mumps , because it was the only call a doctor ever made at the Novak home , and for Tom this was an event . " I lay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was so sick I thought I was going to die . Dr. Sydney Wittenberg , I even remember his name , gave me some medicine . I remember thinking what a great thing he 'd done . coming to the house and curing me . " Tom 's father . Michael , a thick-bodied , taciturn man , grew up on a northern Michigan farm and remembers nights when there were only potatoes for dinner . He has worked a six-day week in one of the Detroit auto plants as long as Tom can remember . His mother , who is 56 years old , still puts in a 40-hour week at a large bakery . Tom himself had the largest paper route in Detroit before he was 12 . " My family worked hard and we were always saving , " said Tom . " We had a coffee cup for loose change and everything else went right in the bank . " In this environment , Tom 's dream of becoming a doctor went unattended and died . He claims there was never any thought or talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school he " goofed off , " using his savings to become the sharpest dresser in his crowd , a sport in pegged pants and colored vests . He also smoked , sneaked beer , discovered girls and graduated 229th in a class of 240 from Chadsey High School . After his 18th birthday , on July 29 , 1953 . Tom followed his father into the auto factory , where he was encouraged to become a sponsored student to the General Motors Institute . He rejected the idea , saying , " This was life 's big deal , to come back an engineer and walk around the plant in a white shirt . The whole thing left me numb . " Tom figured that if it was possible to go to college at all , he was going to study what he wanted , medicine ; so he told his father that he was going to Ann Arbor to " look over " the University of Michigan . But at the registrar 's office , he was turned away because he had no high-school credits in chemistry , algebra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that , " Tom remembers , " telling myself what a dummy I was to waste those high-school years and to spend my savings foolishly . Then I began to wonder what would happen if I just stayed there at the university . It was worth a try to see whether I could get away with it . " There were 17.000 students at Michigan that fall , and Tom Novak , dressed in scuffed white bucks , khaki pants and a suit coat worn over a button-down white shirt , appeared to be just another undergraduate instead of a poacher who , as he put it , " phantomed around the campus . " He charted the tough premed schedule , bought all the hooks secondhand and eagerly did the reading . He slipped into large classrooms and sat off to one side , taking in the lectures . " I tried to blend in , " he explained , " to be inconspicuous . " At noontime , while everyone else was at lunch , Tom lurked around the labs , either completing the assigned experiment then and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his seven-dollar-a-week room on South State Street , where he could work at his own pace . As weeks passed , Tom grew more comfortable in his role of student masquerader . He satisfied his proud , naive parents by telling them he had won a full scholarship . He mailed home bogus report cards to prove he was doing well . His campus friends , meanwhile , looked on him as a loner but a good student , the typical premed type  --  always carrying Gray 's Anatomy and quoting from it at the slightest provocation . His best friend at Michigan was John Coxeter , an English major from a small Indiana town and now a newspaperman with the South Bend Tribune . " We had a strong bond ; we were poor together , " Coxeter remembers . " We could afford only one meal a day , a greasy 47-cent double hamburger called a blimpeyburger . ' We washed them down with a quart of milk and that was our dinner . " Tom was living on what he earned each summer . After he paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all other expenses . But by skilled budgeting and considerable self-denial , he was able to buy a secondhand stethoscope and a long-playing record of the normal and abnormal heart sounds . He practiced by listening to his own heart go lubdub. lub-dub and compared the sound with those on the record , playing it over and over . Tom believed he could keep up with the bona fide premedical students by working longer and harder than they did , He determined to spend every possible minute in learning . When he was n't in class or reading or in a lab he prowled the big , 1,200-bed University of Michigan Hospital . Casually but correctly dressed in the white lab coat of an intern , the familiar stethoscope jammed into one of his patch pockets , he moved briskly along the busy corridors . One morning he heard a nurse calling , " Doctor , doctor : ' She held the arm of a woman visitor who seemed about to faint , and she asked Tom , " Would you check her ? " Tom quickly had the woman sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the first time he was called " Doctor , " and he liked the sound . He tells the story now with pride and asks , " Why should anyone suspect me ? I knew what I was doing and I was the young-doctor image . " Following this early triumph , Tom treated the hospital pretty much as though it were his own . He took his girl friend and brother on Sunday afternoon tours , he played pool in the interns ' lounge and attended lab classes , adding , " As long as you were n't one of those antivivisection zealots , the professors never cared who you were . " Tom spent three years at Michigan , completing his equivalent of premed . In the summer of 1956 he went home to Detroit and married Pat Mazur , a 17-year-old Polish girl who was mature and resourceful , but knew nothing of his deception . That fall the couple moved to Baltimore . where Pat supported them by working in the telephone company and Tom " phantomed " around Johns Hopkins University medical school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Novak . There was always some place he could go and learn through observation . He haunted the 13 operating rooms , where he says he watched major surgery from the floor , and spent many hours in the pathology lab . Here he saw what cancer was like , what a plugged coronary artery or a constricted heart valve looked like , and he returned again and again , drawn by the experience of learning . In complete sincerity , Novak explained that after studying the medical-school catalogues , he chose Johns Hopkins because , " they gave the student all the experience he could handle , and I liked that . " If Tom had his way , he would have spent four years there , but when Pat became pregnant that spring and had to quit work , they reluctantly went home to Detroit , where her parents volunteered to pay the rent on a four-room brick house . Tom looked upon the move as just one more time in his life when he did n't have money enough to do as he wanted , " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " but I knew it was uncomfortable , and I suppose I determined to do something about it . " At Michigan , Tom remembers , everyone had more money than he did , notably the boy whose father owned a private hospital . His friend , John Coxeter , recalled that Tom " could n't wait to get out of school and make it big ; he wanted to be a doctor , but he was after the loot too . " Back in Detroit , Tom picked up his study routines at Wayne State University medical school and in Receiving Hospital , a busy city hospital affiliated with the local medical school . He continued to keep his secret from his wife and family for the next three years . mailing himself reports to vouch for his satisfactory progress . But the hardships consistently nagged at him , and he often was despondent , almost to the point of quitting . The feeling that someday he must be found out never stopped bothering him . " Some nights I 'd lie there in a cold sweat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd torture myself , wondering what would happen when I was caught . But I would n't  --  I could n't  --  quit . I convinced myself that I was n't doing wrong , and that if you were a good doctor , there was no reason to be caught . " Ironically , Novak 's most trying hour as a university masquerader came at the graduation exercises . On a warm night in June . 1960 , he fell into line with the Wayne State school-of-medicine students as they marched into the huge State Fair Coliseum . " Right away , I started to get clutched , " he said . " I had this terrible feeling there would n't be enough seats , and that I 'd be left standing , or they would call out the individual names and mine could n't possibly be called . " The ceremony , however , went smoothly . There were chairs for everyone , and when finally the dean announced . " I confer upon you the degree of doctor of medicine and all the rights and privileges therewith , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive dummy diplomas , the real ones to be mailed later to everyone but Novak . Tom truly felt he was now ready to practice medicine and , in fact . he already was attending some patients . Neighborhood people , some of whom remembered him as their former newsboy , brought their children , or asked him to stop in on a bedridden grandmother . For the next year . Doctor Tom " interned " out of the basement of his home but claimed to be at Henry Ford Hospital , " because that was a status symbol and impressed people . " In the spring he found a practice for sale after a doctor had died . Luckily it was only six blocks from his home , in a one-story medical-and-dental building just off the busy intersection of Wyoming and Schoolcraft avenues . Tom borrowed $2,000 for a down payment and contracted to pay $269 a month to a total of $19,000 . Two months before his 26th birthday , " Thomas M. Novak , M.D. , " riveted his tasteful but good-sized brass shingle over those of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dentist , and Novak 's predecessor . the late Dr. Edgar A. Bicknell . Then he sat back and waited for the first patients to appear . Less than a week after the office was opened . a ramrod-straight old man was rushed in with two fingers mutilated by a power saw . The tips of the fingers COUNTERFEIT DOCTOR hung by slender tissue , and Novak used 38 stitches to sew up the hand . While he worked , he explained that the wound might not heal properly because of the man 's age , but the thick and callused old lingers knit perfectly . Pat Novak often saw the man , Edward Matthews , a 74-year-old retired electrician , around her supermarket after that . She said , " He 'd yell across the aisle and hold up the two lingers in the victory sign and say , ' There they are , good as new ! ' " Shortly after Tom moved in , Doctor Pierce . the dentist in the adjoining office , complained that he felt tired most of the time . Torn diagnosed his condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he treated , checking the loss of blood . The patients had come slowly at first , but now that Tom was tested ( Doctor Pierce was boosting his reputation in the neighborhood ) , they came in a stream  --  and they /eft the office singing his praises : " He 's cheerful .. . He 's so young ... You can always get him to come ... He makes you feel better just with his talking ... The children love him . " Torn fell into the routine readily , and the practice became his life . He worked 12. 14. sometimes 16 hours a day and as word of his competence spread , he was asked by several older doctors to substitute for them and make their house calls . Through these doctors Tom got himself and his patients into three Detroit hospitals and was able to carry on as though he were a staff physician , By the end of 1961 , just seven months after he opened the practice , Novak had earned $15,000 and was averaging 200 patients a week  --  not all of whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was his simple boast that $2,000 was owed to him and " / always did my share of charity work too , " He looked after the priests at St. Brigid 's and was team doctor for the grammar-school football players . " To me , being a doctor was n't work , " he said . " I never counted hours and I believed you were a doctor every day . Saturdays and Sundays were no different . The phone would ring , and I 'd grab my black bag and head for the car . Over my shoulder I 'd hear Pat protesting , ' Must you cure the whole world ? ' That was a saying in our house . " The practice grew and grew until there were 2,511 patients from 1,180 families and , in 1962 , Tom 's income rose to $35,000 . It reached $40,000 the next year and was headed for better than $50,000 in 1964 . Tom insists that medicine is what really mattered to him , the money only came because the patients flocked to his office . Nonetheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a new life . They built a $24,500 , ten-and-a-half-room home in the suburbs and tilled it with French and Italian provincial furniture . They drove two cars . Pat got a mink stole , the children went to nursery school , and Tom joined a country club for golf . Tom carried two credit cards , a roll of cash , and every morning took a fresh shine for his $30 shoes , tipping the boy a dollar . For the first time in his life Tom Novak was completely independent . " I did n't have to ask anyone for anything ; our life in those days was perfect , " he said . Then , last summer , the perfect life began to chip apart . Tom began having difficulty with his equilibrium , and he was continually overtired . He suspected multiple sclerosis , and another doctor 's opinion confirmed his belief . It became his second secret , shared only by his wife . The incurable and slowly crippling disease had first struck him four years before , impairing the vision in one eye and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On his bad days he stumbled on stairs , fumbled for his instruments , and was exhausted by late afternoon . When the left hand grew so stiff that he could n't write prescriptions , he taught himself to use his right . And , while he should have been getting more rest , he stepped up his pace . " It was a funny thing with my hands , " he said . " Once I got a grip on the surgical instrument , I was in full control . The stiffness seemed to leave me . Many times I did stitching on one of my bad days . I remember sewing up a woman 's face , using twenty-some stitches around the eyes , and it was as good a job as I ever did . " On another of the so-called bad days , Tom sewed up the arm of seven-year-old Melanie Lane after the child crashed through a storm door , cutting herself so badly that her mother feared she might be left crippled . Tom realized , nevertheless , that he was losing the battle with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he was frightened for himself and his practice . He felt that he needed additional life insurance and asked his agent to double his $25,000 policy . This was the move that brought the final disaster to Tom Novak 's life . A week later the insurance man told Tom a routine credit investigation showed there was no Dr. Thomas M. Novak with the Wayne County ( Detroit ) or Michigan medical societies , nor was he listed with the state Board of Registration in Medicine . " I told them you must he a doctor , " said the agent , " because you 've been practicing okay for four years . " Although there are 9,000 licensed physicians in Michigan , the medical board has only one investigator , a painstaking retired state policeman named Charles C. Holton , who last year traveled 8,286 miles tracking down charlatans , quacks and medical cheats . On Friday night , August 28 , Holton , alerted by the insurance company . parked his car in the shadows of Wyoming Avenue and sat watching patients file in and out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rang the belt and handed Tom his card with the Michigan seal in the upper left-hand corner . He said evenly , " You 've caused us quite a bit of embarrassment down in the capitol . " At first Tom tried to brazen it through , claiming he was licensed in Maryland where he went to school , but had n't bothered to take out a Michigan license . Told to show up with his diplomas and other credentials , he poured out the whole story the following Wednesday before the medical board in Lansing . " I 'll never forget Pat 's first reaction , " said Tom . " She just said , ' Well , now the children will see more of you . ' " Later on , both families had a good cry , and Tom 's father remarked that he knew all along Tom should have gone to engineering school . The story broke big in Detroit , Radio and television carried the news every hour . Cranks , drunks , angry neighbors , newsmen and well-meaning friends called the Novak house . Stunned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine , or asking simply . " Is that you on TV , Doctor Novak ? " Tom 's lawyer and friend , Richard L. Lehman , turned from a TV newscast and said quickly to his wife , " Carol , bring me the telephone book  --  and there better be two Dr. Thomas M. Novaks in it . " At first , Tom insisted on taking all the calls , explaining that " no one got sick or died because of any lack of knowledge on my part . I knew what I was doing . " For most of his patients the explanation was unnecessary . They were already reacting like crusaders . Some offered to raise money for the defense ; one woman wrote President Johnson for help and others wired or phoned the prosecutor until he told the switchboard , " No more Novak calls . " At St. Brigid 's Church , Father Joseph Byrne reminded his parishioners of the Biblical injunction to " judge not lest ye be judged " and urged them to pray for their good friend who was " in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about Tom Novak . Everyone Novak confers with his attorney , Richard L. Lehman , in . Detroit House of Correction . He is now serving a one-year sentence . but other doctors , that is . Few medical men were willing to discuss Novak 's abilities seriously , preferring instead to treat the matter as a joke . One doctor said . " He was nothing more than a scrub nurse , I understand . I doubt that he treated anyone who was really sick . " Another widely held feeling was expressed by the president of the county medical society , who said , " I hope this does n't hurt our image too much . " But there was one doctor who came to Tom 's defense . Dr. R. J. McPherson , I who has been a general practitioner for more than 25 years , remembered that Novak made calls for him and added , " I never had reason to doubt his judgment ; he was a good doctor . I think he even taught us old fellows something , to be more understanding with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of practicing medicine without a license and possession of barbiturates . In Detroit Recorder 's Court on November 24 he was sentenced to prison for one year by Judge Paul E. Krause , who apparently relied upon a probation report which described Novak as " egocentric and insolent " and which also said that in his later years he actually believed he was a physician . " Maybe you helped people , I am not sure . " Judge Krause said from the bench . " But it is also possible that you might have hurt people . And to use the vernacular , there was a little bit of ' con ' in your work . " The state 's probation report declared Novak showed no remorse . This is generally true , because Tom believes the good he did outweighs the bad . " I 'm sobered by the fact that I was capable of so much deception , " he said one morning recently . " but I did n't defraud anyone , and I want people to understand this . I really took care of my patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they were satisfied . No one can say I was just taking their money . " But I do n't expect anyone will ever understand why I did it . I did it , really . because for those four years I was a doctor , and I 'd do it all over again for that same reason .
