Billy Graham went there , but he is now regarded as a heretic by the Jones Family ? which owns and operates the $30-million school , dedicated to the Bible as literal truth and to its own special brand of culture . There are approximately five hundred families of Joneses to keep up with in and around Greenville , South Carolina , which calls itself the " Textile Center of the World . " It is an old , flawed city of 66,188 set among rolling , red-clay hills reaching into neighboring Georgia . People named Jones attend their looms in dozens of mills , till the soil , and over at the Jones Funeral Home they have for fifty-three years buried the dead with " Dignity , Quietude , and Beauty . " But in circles where the Holy Writ is taken undiluted by Modernism , and political potions taste sweetest when untainted by anything of lesser vintage than McKinley , the only Jones Boys who count are the Bob Joneses : Senior , Junior , and III . They are , respectively , the Founder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World 's Most Unusual University . " Any list of what makes Bob Jones University unusual must begin with the Jones Boys themselves , a trio as inseparable as the Holy Trinity . Who else owns ? free of debt , sorority-house panty raids , and sullen alumni bent on hanging the coach ? an educational institution valued at more than $30 million ? Who else imports a small-college professor from Virginia ( vaguely but officially presented as " a leading scientist " ) to teach that the world 's creation processes " terminated at the end of six days " and that " the world could not possibly be more than 10,000 years old " ? yet , on the other hand , claims to be nowhere excelled " in the thoroughness of scholastic , cultural , and artistic work " ? Who else forbids students to see Hollywood movies ? yet produces films good enough to win plaudits at the International Film Festival in Cannes and an award from Screen Producers Guild of Hollywood ? Who else toured the Bible Belt during the 1964 Presidential campaign in a bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not run a partisan institution ? Nobody else . But then nobody else has a university that is completely family-held . The Jones family ? father , son , and grandson ? control the 185-acre campus sprawled along U. S. 29 on Greenville 's outskirts , and they control everything on it . Whether you buy a $4 copy of Dr. Bob Jones , - Tr. ' s novel , Wine of Morning , at the Book Stall or study your Sunday School lesson over ten-cent coffee at Little Moby 's , probably the only campus hangout in America pushing Crucifixion Art , every nickel put in the till goes to God and the Joneses . There is eighty-two-year-old Robert Reynolds Jones , Sr. , called by all ? including himself ? simply The Founder . Thirty-eight years ago in Florida he founded the forerunner of the present " Fortress of Faith " that is BJU . On his good days , bundled against the chill of his years in a black coat , cape , and hat , he strolls the campus to exchange Scriptural quotations with BJU students : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Modernism , and liberalism at any opportunity . There is The Founder 's son , balding , fifty-four year-old Bob Jones , Jr. , President of BJU , whose artistic taste runs to Shakespeare , Van Dyck , Sebastiano del Piombo , opera arias , and his own best-selling evangelistic novels . The third member of the triumvirate , twenty-seven-year-old Bob Jones , HI , is the school 's administrative Pooh-Bah . Bob-the-Third is a lanky , handsome youth who likes to wear tailored pinstripes with narrow English lapels , slant pockets , and pointed-toe shoes ; he enjoys tooling around in his red Mercedes-Benz . But despite these eccentricities in son and grandson , they are firmly with The Founder in their exhortations against dancing , watered-down Scripture , and repeal of right-to-work laws , and in upholding total immersion , racial segregation , and eternal damnation for all who go a few degrees wrong . They like to tell you at BJU of their cultural triumphs ; how Bob Jones Opera Association has produced Faust , The Barber of Seville , and the difficult Ernani ( " last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing in operatic luminaries to sing lead roles ? Cesare Valletti , a leading tenor of the Metropolitan Opera Company and La Scala , Milan ; Jarmila Novotna , and Marjorie Lawrence . Or they recall the annual Artist Series ' presentations of actor Sir Cedric Hardwicke , violinist Henryk Szeryng , and pianist Maria Tipo . They point to trophies won by the school 's Unusual Films , or to plaudits bestowed on BJU 's Classic Players by Shakespearean scholars . They tell you that even varsity football was unceremoniously scrapped years ago when the Fighting Angels turned out to have littered the dorms with cigarette butts , beer cans , and other symbols of earthly distractions , And they pridefully say that more students study Greek at BJU than at any undergraduate school in America . All this is true . Larry L. King , a native Texan , grew up the son of a farmer who was a part-time country preacher . His novel of politics , " The One-Eyed Man , " to be published in June by New American Library , is an alternate selection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Bob Jones University primarily exists , according to a warning sign in Mack Library , " to exalt the Lord Jesus Christ . The teaching of mathematics , science , literature , music , speech , art , and all other subjects are incidental to this . " BJU has supplied more ministers for Fundamentalist pulpits than any school on earth ; 5,000 of them attend the spiritual needs of about one million Americans each Sunday . The 612 students in the School of Religion ( " Our Preacher Boys , " as they are called I must serve off-campus pulpits every weekend . They carry The Word by bus , car , and even horse to hamlets like Reform , Alabama ; Brushy Creek , South Carolina ; and Fair Play , Georgia . Last year the Preacher Boys distributed a quarter-million Bible tracts , held more than 35,000 services in South Carolina churches alone , and conducted " persona visitations " with almost 100,000 citizens through door-to-door house calls or simply by ambushing unwary sidewalk loafers . Not for these hearty proselytizers an elastic creed which might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the Saturday night stomps in thickets along the creek forks . They endorse a fiery Hell with white-hot pitchforks and acrid brimstone , a Heaven where Saint Peter is as real as the armed student guards on BJU 's main gates . The Founder sees to that . " If you will trim Jesus down to suit the Modernists , " he says , " they will like it . I 've never trimmed Jesus down . " He has cut some others down to size , though , and foremost among these is the Devil . The Founder denounced Satan to the mules he plowed as a seven-year-old Alabama farm boy back in 1890 . He broadened his audience to include human souls as a teen-age minister who " got the Call " at a backwoods revival in his eleventh year . By the time he was forty , Robert . Reynolds Jones , Sr. , who thrived in the era of Billy Sunday and John Culpepper , had " led a million souls to Christ . " The Founder has not confined his attacks to Satan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pope . anti-God scientists , loose women , the National Council of Churches , hillbilly music , whiskey merchants , pie-eating politicians , and lukewarm Christians who eschew orthodoxy . In The Founder 's view , " Orthodoxy says the Bible is the word of God ; Modernism says the Bible merely contains the word of God . " The " pie-eaters " are politicians who gobble up the false riches of liberalism at the cost of becoming fat in the head , soul , and heart . In 1928 , The Founder made five hundred speeches for Fundamentalism and Herbert Hoover against Al Smith . ( " I 'd rather see a nigger President . " ) He and his heirs have expressed hostility toward every Democratic Presidential nominee since . Campus-speaking favorites include homegrown Senator Strom Thurmond , 1948 Dixiecrat candidate for President , who recently converted to Republicanism ; Governor George Wallace of Alabama ; General Edwin A. Walker ; Southern Methodist University Professor John Beaty , author of Iron Curtain ( ) VET America ; radio rightists Dr. Carl McIntyre and the Reverend Billy James Hargis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over BJU radio station WMUU* ; and The National Review 's Bill Buckley . Red-letter Shalt Nots Last Thanksgiving Sunday , preaching to 3,300 in overflowing Rodeheaver Auditorium , BJU 's Dean of Men got in pulpit licks against the United Nations , Medicare , the Federal Communications Commission , and labor unions . ( " Noah , building the Ark in accordance with God 's command , did n't have to worry about unions or time-and-a-half for overtime . " ) On the BJU bus tour for Barry Goldwater , banners warned : " Turn Back America ! Only a Divine Miracle Can Save Us Now ! " Stilt , the Joneses get their dander up if you say they run a political institution . One thing they assuredly do not run at Bob Jones University is a democracy . " If you do n't like it here , " The Founder has reminded students and faculty alike , " you can pack your dirty duds and hit the four-lane highway . " Some of the 3,500 students do exactly that each year . Nobody will say how many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk to newsmen , writers , or to any stranger whose business is unknown . But in 1953 the registrar , three deans , and a dozen teachers resigned after charging The Founder with insisting that " the tiniest facet of his thought " be considered red-letter Gospel ? an act which inspired The Founder to speak on Judas . Though in theory faculty members are hired for life , they can by contract be fired on ten-day notice . Dr. Bob Jr. , who in his role as President spends most of his time traveling to raise funds and recruit students , puts it bluntly : " We do not believe it is a just use of the term ' academic freedom ' for a man to be able to say , ' I 'm gon na teach evolution or free love in this school . ' Academic freedom here boils down to the ability to say or do anything you want to do ? so long as it does n't offend the Bible . " " Standing for " World 's Most Unusual University , " one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones guidelines , however , the Bible is easier to offend than Maria Callas . You can offend it by listening to , singing , or playing jazz , by picking up a deck of cards ; or by becoming inquisitive over the specific biological details of the Immaculate Conception . Indeed , your wife can offend the Book for you by wearing slacks or merely by " griping . " Wives are considered under contract to serve BJU in their best capacities the moment their husbands join the faculty . Room and board are computed in salary scales , and salaries are based on " need . " Thus an instructor with five mouths to feed is paid more than a childless full professor . Dr. R. K. Johnson , BJU business manager and an orphan boy who came as a student in 1928 and has never left , claims that " fringe benefits of our group far exceed any I 've ever heard of . Our faculty members are better off than they would be in any other system in the world . " But BJU is not popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , academically speaking , a heavily incestuous air about the faculty . All but twenty-six of its 160 teachers got at least part of their education at BJU . Four of ten doctorates ( including that of Vice-President Bob Jones IM were awarded on the home campus . " Dr. " Bob Sr. and " Dr. " Bob Jr . have honorary Doctor of Divinity degrees . The Founder 's was granted by Muskingum College , New Concord , Ohio ; the President 's is courtesy of Northwestern Schools , Minneapolis . For every Shalt Not binding the faculty , students are restricted by at least a half-dozen . They shall not use the gymnasium , swimming pool , or tennis courts in sexually mixed groups ; nor borrow anything from townspeople ; nor release any information to newspapers . Nor shall they patronize any store ( drug , restaurant , or grocery included ) that sells liquor , wine , or beer ; nor become addicts of " hillbilly screechers , swing bands , or syncopated hop-skip-and-jump music " ; nor leave the campus after 10:30 P.M. One violation can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other , but who fails to report it , is considered as guilty as the original sinner . No Goldfish , No Deadbeats The Founder , though he has lived long past the three score and ten years allotted by the Bible , has not forgotten the warm-blooded folly of youth . " It is a little dangerous , " he warns , " to make love *One must , however , balance this observation with the notation that Dr. Johnson has favorably compared The Founder with Saint Paul . on a moonlight night . " Fat chance of that . Off-campus dating is taboo unless special permission is granted ; even then , dates must be chaperoned . On-campus dates are limited to two hours ; buys and girls must keep a six-inch space between their bodies whether sitting or standing . To be found with a blanket anywhere on campus , except in one 's own room , is as final as Doomsday . " Bob Jones students , " says young Dr. Bob III , " do not swallow goldfish . They do n't care how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't waste their time with checkers , chess , or puzzles . " They do n't smoke or gripe , either . The college catalogue warns that " no griping will be tolerated " ; students must fill out forms each year attesting that tobacco and liquor have not touched their lips since last they signed the pledge . Most BJU students were raised in hard-shell Baptist churches , though by no means all . Many are from such Holy Roller sects as the Church of God or Assembly of God . Others are low-church Presbyterians , Methodists , and Campbellites . When Preacher Boys go forth to spread The Word , they generally migrate to Baptist pulpits . The school is officially nonsectarian , however . The Founder quit the Methodist Church of his father in 1939 , blasting it as " a honeycomb of Modernism . " ) " Our kids are the cream of the crop , " Dr. Bob III says . " They 've really got to be zealots to make it here . A lot of them come here over the objections of parents who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a history of " going to Daddy 's Old School , " too . In America 's small towns and on its farms are fathers who rush their heirs off to Greenville the way Philadelphia Main Line lawyers or fathers holding seats on the Stock Exchange point their sons toward Harvard or Yale . BJU graduates tend to marry each other ; rarely do the offspring of such unions escape to other campuses . The school rightfully claims students from all fifty states and thirty foreign countries . But the student body is predominantly Southern , though California , Pennsylvania , and Indiana have sizable delegations . Most BJU students prepare for careers in the ministry or in teaching . But the School of Business is growing rapidly , and talent scouts for management are increasingly attracted to Greenville . Bob Jones graduates are neat , orderly , and take to corporate discipline . " You do n't get any boat-rockers or deadbeats hanging around the water cooler or loafers betting on office football pools , " a Bendix Company recruiter says . It is not difficult to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courteous to afault when not rattling about God or Goldwater , and they radiate determined cheer even before breakfast . By edict boys wear ties at all times , and coats to meals . Girls are never without hose ; they are permitted just enough facial makeup to prevent possible mutiny arising from the inborn vanity of their sex . There is more spit-'n ' - polish than at West Point . Bells sound for reveille and lights out ; attendance at all chapels and meals is mandatory ; all classes or discussion groups must be prayed open and prayed closed . All this is " heavenly manna " to The Founder , after which , he says , " garlic and onions can never taste good anymore . " To partake of such manna , the BJU student pays $1,000 annual tuition . God and Radioactivity If other Fundamentalist schools had done their jobs the way The Founder and God wanted them to , Bob Jones University would not be a going concern today . But other schools would not remain loyal to orthodoxy . They began to harbor a professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " they surrendered to the atheistic drift in education , " and they came to see symbolism in the Garden of Eden 's talking serpent instead of simply recognizing him as a real old snake in the grass . All this had happened by 1927 . Bob Jones , Sr. , by then deserved ( and sometimes got ) equal billing in the evangelistic big leagues with the flamboyant " praying baseball player , " Billy Sunday . On one memorable occasion when more than 6,000 erring sinners walked the aisle to give themselves to Deity , Dr. Jones was there to receive them . Though feeling he was blessed in his ministry , Dr. Jones had nagging thoughts that something was wrong . One day he figured out what it was . " T am tired , " he told his wife , " of leading boys and girls to Jesus Christ and then seeing them attend institutions which shake their faith . Honey , I am going to build a school . " They called it Bob Jones College when doors opened in September 1927 , among five hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida . Following the Depression crash of 1929 , Dr. Jones moved the school to " more centrally located Cleveland . Tennessee . " There it remained until 1946 , when the city of Greenville offered free the present 185-acre campus . " Some of the money was mine and some of the money was a gift of God , " is about as specific as The Founder gets about financing five buildings of Spanish architecture on the original Florida site . The Founding Class of 125 tilled twenty acres to produce campus food , milked a twelve-cow dairy herd , and operated a canning factory . Governor Bibb Graves of Alabama came to dedicate a school pledged by charter " to combat all atheistic , agnostic , pagan , and so-called scientific adulteration of the Gospel . " But Dr. Jones did not want to found " just another Bible College . " Though giving " special emphasis to the Christian religion and the ethics revealed in the Holy Scripture , " he would " conduct an institution of learning for the general education of youth in the essentials of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must wonder , though BJU 's official family does not , whether these scholastic expectations have been realized , Only a few deep Dixie and prairie-state schools enthusiastically welcome BJU products for graduate work . The school is not a member of the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools , nor is it affiliated with national education organizations . The Joneses claim this has nothing to do with poor academic ratings . Long ago The Founder got on record that " we can render better services spiritually and even educationally without holding organic membership in an association . " BJU has also refused federal grants rather than sign " the so-called Act of Compliance and be at the mercy of federal control . " The official line out of Greenville is that BJU would be cheerfully admitted to almost any academic circle it wished to join , but is choosy about whom it circles up with . This contention is judged closer to pure truth on the BJU campus than in more detached quarters . One can imagine academic heavyweights wondering about any institution where an anthropology course is described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problems of evolution and human origins , " or where the clinical psychology course bears down on " the application of Biblical principles to the diagnosis and treatment of mental problems . " Nor does it help when a BJU lecturer , asked about radioactive dating methods that show the world to be several million years old , responds that " scientists mistakenly assume that God has never accelerated radioactive decay rates . " Sometimes even the Joneses ca n't seem to make up their minds exactly where their school belongs on academic charts . One moment Dr. Bob III will tell you , " We 're unusual in our objective to teach the student what he already believes . We do n't throw out a bunch of theories about the religions of the world or philosophy and that sort of thing . " In the next , he tosses off the names of BJU gradby uates who are " recognized masters in the world of arts and letters . " He cites Clifford Lewis , a member of the Founding Class , as the author of 238 Precious Poems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , books of inspirational sermons , and volumes of devotional verse " by BJU 's own Dr. Bob Jr . " have been critically acclaimed in Bible Banner and The Christian Herald . " The same Dr. Bob ( author , president , actor ) , you are given to understand , is skilled enough on the boards to have " turned down offers of Hollywood screen tests . " Junior . Jones is not , in fact , a bad actor , nor an inexperienced one . In University dramas , his roles have included Shylock , Macbeth , Lear , and Pontius Pilate in the screen dramatization of his own novel , Wine of Morning. * Wine of Morning , a two-hour color production , won not only the National Evangelical Film Foundation 's four top " Oscars , " but high praise from the French Institute of Cinematography , the Canadian Kodak Company , the Italian Motion Pieture Institute , and critics at the International Film Festival in Cannes . It hat been shown on TV in Switzerland , enjoyed a Paris run under sponsorship of the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " breathtaking photography " ( though not its Christian message ) , and has gladdened BJU coffers as the all-time box-office smash of evangelical filmdom . A twelve-minute full-color production , The Flying Angel , a trailer on how movies are made at BJU , was voted the Intercollegiate Film Award for Short Subjects by the Screen Producers Guild . BJU ranks , in fact , with UCLA , Boston University , and the University of Southern California as a king of collegiate cinema-making . It is not likely , however , to send its graduates to Hollywood tasks . Signs posted in the block-long shooting studio warn against vanity , and remind one that talent is God-given . " When we first started the movie thing here , " says Dr. Bob Jr. , " some people were afraid we might be going Modernist . But that was n't it . We just decided the Devil had been granted a monopoly on drama long enough . " Billy Graham vs . BJU In Christian lore , Christianity and persecution are synonyms . Holy wars ... raw meat for the lions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herod and Pharaoh and the king of Moab . Bondage and dungeons and crucifixion . You understand Jones does not need screen tests at BJU . He is casting director . how deeply ingrained all this is when you hear The Founder growl , " We took on all the enemies of Jesus Christ when we founded this school . " The theme is everywhere . In Melton Wright 's Fortress of Faith , the official BJU story , we are told : " There have been well-organized , well-financed schemes to smear Dr. Jones ' name and to ruin his influence , ruin Bob Jones University , and cripple the whole Fundamentalist movement through Dr. Jones . " And The Founder himself is fond of saying , " The door to opportunity swings on the hinges of opposition . " Sometimes the Jones clan seems to give the door a push . Take the Billy Graham case . Billy Graham , the biggest mover and shaker on the revival circuit for the past fifteen years , was a BJU student briefly in 1936 . He left , by his version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He could n't stand the discipline , " says young Bob III . quoting lessons learned at his granddaddy 's feet . " To be an evangelist , " The Founder says he once told Reverend Dr. Graham to his face , the Lord wants a man to have brains in his head , grace in his heart , and guts in his belly ? and you , Billy , do n't have any of them . " At BJU they think Dr. Graham has " trimmed Jesus down . " He had welcomed to his platform Catholic Cardinals , pie-eating politicians , and representatives of the National Council of Churches . He has prayed over Lyndon B. Johnson 's inauguration , and insists on preaching only to racially integrated audiences . He has kind words for the United Nations , and he attended an Inaugural Gala where T in the words of an ex-Preacher Boy now filling a Georgia pulpit ? " had been gathered three hundred bartenders to pour whiskey and une preacher to pray . " President Jones has listed Satan 's " three forces in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the New Evangelicalism . Of these three , the last group is the most dangerous . " You know where that puts Dr. Graham , do n't you ? " Why , I tried every way in the world to help Billy , " The Founder says . " He asked to be considered one of my Preacher Boys , even though he quit us here before his shirttail had time to come out , and he asked to return here and speak to our students . " Dr. Jones welcomed the Prodigal Son with an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree . But those were the days when Billy Graham scolded labor unions and warned that " over 1,100 social-sounding organizations are communist or communist-operated in this country . " Times changed , and so did Billy . He got to running with " those who proclaimed only the humanistic virtues of Christ , " says The Founder . He put down extremism , broke bread with the New Nixon , and played golf with Jack Paar . In 1957 The Founder refused to permit a campus Prayer Day asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying he wanted no part in " the great compromise . " In flat-earth Fundamentalist circles , it was the shot heard across the world . The Mark of Fundamentalism Greenville , South Carolina , goes with Bob Jones University like cornbread goes with sweet milk . When Dial-A-Prayer service first came to Greenville , so many people called they overloaded the phone circuits . The city has 126 churches : 119 Protestant , 61 of them Baptist . The biggest thing on local TV is Billy Crammer and his Gospel Guitar . The program is sponsored by a roach powder and a stomach tonic ; Billy always twangs out a Sacred Number dedicated to " all you shut-ins out there in television-land . " Greenville is the kind of town where everybody calls the noon meal " dinner , " and supper is on the edge of bedtime . Guests may drink a little whiskey in the " private clubs " up on new Highway 29 , but downtown in the old , gone-to-seed section . BJU Preacher Boys shout their warnings of hellfire next to red-paint reminders that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sloped streets where the middle class lives there is an aura of faint decay and gentle Southern decadence . Down in the city 's bottoms , the yards of shack-dwelling textile mill " lint-heads " are grotesquely beautified by sprays of flowers growing from the centers of whitewashed auto tires anchored in the ground . Greenville is the Old South , and the Old South is of the Fundamentalism to which the Jones Boys owe their allegiance . This faith fed on the region 's inbred clannishness and historic reluctance to change its stubborn clinging to old values . You see this stubbornness there today in die-hard segregationists , village cops who fear One World Government , working men who suspect labor unions ; in the Ku Klux Klan 's perverted distortions of Lee 's Lost Cause , and in ancestry worship to rival the Japanese . The frontier church often became school and sideshow as well as spiritual pillar . Early-day evangelists were often more acrobat than prophet . Even today 's modern " faith healers " ( Oral Roberts , for example ) tour in tents and employ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion " tempted each act to top the other . just as vaudeville did . It bred cultists whu tottered on the brink of religious hysteria : folks who want in for foot-washings , talked in tongues , kept multiple wives , or as the late Governor Earl Long of Louisiana said , " chunked snakes and caught fevers . " This was the Fundamentalism I knew in childhood : a combination gaudy tent show and grim Puritanism . One might with impunity jig-dance in the throes of the Holy Spell , but tap not one foot in response to bows drawn across catgut strings . It was a personalized religion : God was as real as the truant officer or the superintendent of schools . The Founder of Bob Jones University knew this personal faith . He would " lie in bed and talk to God , " he " met God in a personal way out in the woods , " and he " felt God 's tap on the shoulder . " It was , really , a form of faith in one 's self , an extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first thing you see in the Administration Building is a sign warning : " Visitors Will Not Smoke in BJU Buildings . " The second is a door marked " Do Not Enter . " I ran the gauntlet of signs last November . For several days I had prowled the campus unannounced , observing students and teachers ( though failing in attempts at meaningful conversation with any of them ) , attending Thanksgiving services , taking stock of the physical plant . Student patrolmen looked me over but never approached . One patrol ear stayed close while I circled among homes in the faculty compound ( where the Joneses have the biggest homes ) , but when I kept going the patrol car did too . When I called on Dr. Bob Jones III shortly before noon one day , a pretty young receptionist said , " Young Dr. Bob 's out to dinner . " Waiting , I eyed bigger-than-life oil portraits of the Jones Boys and their wives which dominate the Administration Building lobby . The portraits reminded me of those I had seen over mantels in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chin duplications had been carefully painted out . Young Dr. Jones received me an hour later . He was faintly bathed in the sunlight which streamed through stained-glass windows . He appeared more than six feet tall , slim , and even younger than his years . His dark hair had been neatly clipped in accord with school rules . He had a firm handclasp and a wide mouth that often smiled when his eyes did not . In his narrow-lapel pinstripes and pointed shoes he would have been called a " jellybean " in the brush country of my youth . The office with its stained glass . paneled walls , deep carpet , and executive desk was altogether attractive . It took a while to decide what was missing : books and ash trays . Bob III 's desk held but a single copy of National Geographic , two sheets of paper , and a telephone . Several times I tentatively reached for a cigarette . Each time Jones eyed me furtively . When he learned my mission , Dr. Jones held Christian rejoicing to a minimum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid I ca n't help you . Not unless you promise you 'll write a strictly factual story . " I said I hoped to , but that in matters of religion and politics folks often had trouble agreeing on facts . Young Dr. Bob scowled . He said , " I will not talk about politics or religion . if you want to do a factual piece about our facilities or our accomplishments , fine . But no religion and no politics . " I quoted the sign from Mack Library : " Bob Jones University exists to exalt the Lord Jesus Christ . " I read the names of BJU political speakers . and mentioned the Goldwater tour . Did n't that put the school somewhat into religion and politics ? Dr. Jones was vexed . " But this not a partisan institution . I tried to explain that to reporters from The Nation and the New York Times . It did n't do a bit of good . They wrote the same old stuff the liberal press always writes .

" Young Dr. Jones recognized I was quoting his grandfather , and that is when I realized his eyes do not smile every time his mouth does . We talked politics and religion for two hours . The exchange began when I mentioned Billy Graham . I had asked where Dr. Graham had " gone wrong . " To tell the truth , it was like hunting with a baited trap . " I just do n't understand him , " Dr. Jones said . " He had everything . God had blessed his work ... " He shook his head , leaned back in his chair and his eyes got bright . I had seen that look in the eyes of a hundred preachers . It meant singing was over and the sermon would begin . He said , " God has blessed this school . He raised it up and He has sustained it . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We serve a great God . . . . People support this school because they know the Devil wo n't get one nickel of their money . We have n't compromised .

We know that with any amount of government money comes a like amount of government controls . No whiskey-drinking bureaucrat is going to draw us a blueprint for preaching the salvation of Jesus Christ the way he 'd draw a blueprint for some urban renewal scheme . Why , if we ever compromised Jesus Christ , then by law this school could he closed down . The Founder had that put in the charter . " We get kids with a lot of character , " he said . " They come here because they ca n't get what we offer at the bohemian colleges . They do n't want a campus where they can buy pep pills and tranquilizers or go on alcoholic sprees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid . Other schools handed us that monopoly on a silver platter by stressing materialism and intellectualism ? and they 're the twin foes of the Gospel . " Did n't liberalism rate high among " foes of the Gospel " at BJU ? Young Bob III reluctantly nodded , as if he had a headache and feared sudden motion . " I guess you 'll bring in the Goldwater bus and make that sound partisan . So I 'd better explain . We hold with old-fashioned Christian Americanism . We think it made this country great . We think it serves freedom , and we think it serves God . Now we are n't partisan , but when liberalism crops up we fight it . And if liberalism crops up in one political party more than in another ... well , that 's not our fault . is it ? " I knew better than to suggest social responsibility as a Christian virtue . The Jones Boys consider social Gospel worse than no Gospel at all . Young Dr. Jones once said , Our graduates are not crusaders against social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Scripture refers to the Christian life many times as spiritual warfare . So our efforts are not primarily for the purpose of making a better world , but rather to spread the good news of salvation . " Dr. Jones had been quoted as saying racial segregation is taught by the Bible . I asked for the Scriptural citation . That always gets quoted out of context , " he said . " I do n't want to discuss it . If I had confidence you 'd print the whole thing .. . well , it 's so long and complicated ? . No , 1 do n't want to talk about that . " persisted . Had n't he said God has decreed the Negro to be " a servant 's servant ' ? " ; that the Negro " is happier when waiting tables " ; when serving mankind in special ways " God intended " ? After a long pause Dr. Jones replied : " Look , I 'm not a racist . This is n't a racist institution . I do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence , then he went beyond it . " I 've known some fine Christian Nigras . I 'm for the Nigra having his rights ; I sure am . But I do feel ... lots of us feel ... " Then with a firm resolve , he declared , " That 's all I 'll say on the subject , sir . I do n't see it has anything to do with Bob Jones University . " Was there even one Negro student in BIC ? Had there ever been ? " Well , now , that 's a matter of record . No , sir . I expect you knew that or you would n't have asked the question . But that 's no reason to ? we 're not , and I 'll say it again , a racist institution . We do n't teach hate . We teach love of Jesus and love by Jesus for his children . " Now sir , that 's absolutely the last word I 'll say on the Nigra subject . " Soon our conversation became desultory . We quarreled mildly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my senses reeled from craving tobacco , I traded final handshakes with him , At the door I asked , " Do you know where I can get a copy of your father 's novel , Wine of Morning ? " Out in the world of carefully curried public images and PR men , two assistant vice-presidents would have materialized carrying freebies . But with Dr. Bob Jones III , charity did not , this day , begin at home . " Yessir , " he said . " You can buy it at our bookstore . " And I could be secure in the knowledge that " not one nickel " of my purchase price would go to the Devil , or to Americans for Democratic Action .
