A Story by ROBIN WHITE Gunfight at the Sure Enough T HERE were two ways of looking at Julian Dekker : either he was wholly unprepared for the experience of Bear Creek Canyon , California , a small , Bohemian , largely undergraduate community better known as " The Canyon , " or his entire life was one long springboard of frustration from which he was flipped , naturally and inevitably , into it . That is to say , he was the product of missionary parents and therefore always mildly suspect . Lean and rather nervous , with a freckled , somehow quizzical face , he had come to the San Francisco Bay Area on his way to India , encountered visa difficulties with the Indian government , and found himself unable to go any farther . Reportedly Living on Grant , he did whatever he pleased and was thus considered to have achieved retirement at the age of twenty-six . It was also rumored that he prayed . This , couplet ! with his courteous manner , at once established him as a Square-From-The-Word-Go and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " was a short form of " Deacon . " At the time of his arrival , sixteen Canyonites were holdovers from Peninsula University 's previous academic year . It was doubtful that they shared much else in common . Despite which , personal reaction to Deke was uniform . All took a cautious interest in him , best summed up inthe words of Ira , the barkeep , a good-willed mountain of flesh who owned the Sure Enough Neighborhood Saloon as well as the Canyon rentals , and who regarded a university education functional so long as it stimulated the consumption of beer : " He do n't look , " said Ira , " like much of a beer drinker , if you ask me . " No one had , but Ira was a man who freely offered opinions unrequested . Part of the general caution about Deke was due to his dog  --  one of the few things he had brought with him in addition to a weathered Volkswagen and a blanket roll strapped to an old footlocker . No one had ever seen anything like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lion-tailed , with a coat the color of a dead orange and a bark like the croak of an ancient frog , it responded cheerfully to any form of attention , negative or positive . Deke had discovered it in a pound ; he and the dog were deeply attached : the dog answered to the name of Solomon . As far as the Canyon was concerned , anyone who owned a thing like that had to have a screw loose . Where the Canyon was prepared to reach an unfavorable conclusion and let it go at that . the reaction of the county sheriff was something else again . A tall , pear-shaped gentleman , with flushed , bulbous features and a dignity as un-96 GUNFIGHT AT THE SURE certain as Solomon 's , Sheriff Joshua Hooker regarded students and immorality as synonymous and was doggedly devoted to proving the point . Owing to the proximity of his home to the Sure Enough , the Canyon had thus become the focal point of his efforts . For some reason the very sight of Solomon in all his glory , dragging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solomon , who wallowed indiscriminately in such attention , made sure Hooker saw a great deal of him . In fact , next to Deke no one saw more of Solomon than the Sheriff , a further indication to the Canyon that " The Thing " ? and so by default its owner  --  was abnormal . N O W it was the Sheriff 's custom to conduct what he called a check-out For all new boys . Periodically he checked out all old boys , too . But his special attention was devoted to fresh arrivals , Fraught with unexplored possibilities for wrongdoing , they presented a unique and Fascinating challenge . So when it became known that cottage B-3I/2 , recently vacated , had acquired a new occupant , Hooker dropped by to greet him . Red light flashing , he drove across the bridge into the Canyon . Deke , who had just introduced Solomon to a very large bone , was sitting on the front steps waiting for the water pressure to improve so he could start scrubbing down the walls and floors . He rose as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " May I help you ? " A low moan of disgust was heard to issue from the bushes surrounding the neighboring cottage . " I 'm the Sheriff , " Hooker said . " You the new boy ? " " I just got here , if that 's what you mean , " Deke said , and introduced himself . " Any previous arrests or traffic violations ? " Deke shook his head . " I 'm checking anyway , " the Sheriff said , and registered this intent on the clipboard he carried . " You at the university ? " " No , sir , I 'm not , " Deke said . " I 'm on special grant to do research in South India . " The Sheriff looked up , eyes narrowed . " How come you 're hanging around here ? " " Because there 's going to he a six-month delay on my visa , " Deke explained . This information was instantly attractive to the Sheriff . " Visa trouble , " he said , and wrote this down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All I know is that there 'll be a delay , " Deke said , " since I 'm not applying for a regular tourist permit . " ENOUGH For several minutes the Sheriff wrote busily on his pad . " You a Communist or something ? " he asked . " Shucks no , " Deke said . " Let me see your forearms , " the Sheriff said . " What for ? " Deke said . " Just let me see ' em , is all , " the Sheriff said , and proceeded to conduct a minute itivestigat ion of both . Uncertainly satisfied , he was again inspired to make a lengthy entry . " OK , Dekker , " he said finally . " You been in the Army , or what ? " " I have n't had any military experience , yet . " " Another draft-dodger , " the Sheriff said , " I was deferred , " Deke said . " So far as I 'm concerned , " the Sheriff said , " that 's legalized draft-dodging , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he went up the steps into the front room . " Do you have a search warrant ? " Deke asked . " No , and you want to make something of it ? " the Sheriff retorted . " Please feel right at home , of course , " Deke said . " Boy , you would n't catch me dead in a dump like this , ' ' the Sheriff said , " except in the line of duty . " He looked around . The front room was equipped with a couch-bed , an old scarred desk , several bookcases , an upright piano , and a fireplace . The fireplace was full of ashes and beer cans . The rug on the floor was rolled . " What you got in that ? " the Sheriff asked , kicking the rug . " Nothing , " Deke said . " I just rolled it so I could scrub the flour when the water came on . You might put that down , by the way . There is n't any pressure in the pipes around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure 's low it 's on account of the water thieves in these here shacks always trying to bypass the meters . And anyhow , do n't tell me what to put down . " He peered into the fireplace . " You have a party last night ? " " I only got here this morning , " Deke said . The front room opened into the kitchen where Solomon was happily chomping on his bone under the sink counter . " What the hell is that ? " the Sheriff inquired . Robin White has written a book of stories and three : novels about India ; his " Elephant Hill " won the Harper Prize Novel Contest in 19.59 . He grew up in India as the son of American missionaries , graduated from Yale , and now lives in Menlo Park , California . " That is Solomon , " Deke explained , and then added with a restrained smile , " He is a clog . " " You got him licensed ? " Deke produced a Los Monos receipt which the Sheriff studied with great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looked into the bathroom with its ancient plumbing , and went into the bedroom . Deke 's footlocker was unsnapped on the floor . The Sheriff poked the contents with his pencil and glanced at the picture of Deke 's parents on the bureau . " My mother and father , " Deke said . " You think I 'm stupid ? " the Sheriff snapped . " What kind of work your old man in ? " " My parents are missionaries to South India , " Dcke said . The Sheriff grimaced and returned to the street . " This your jubbie ? " he asked , indicating the Volks . " That 's right , " Deke said . Hooker studied the license plates as if familiar with the numbers from a stolen car list . " Con-necticut , huh ? " " Yes , sir , " Deke said . " How long you been in California ? " Hooker asked . " Not quite a week , " Deke told him . " Well , you plan on sticking around , you better have them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But it is off the street , " Deke said . The pavement is n't anywhere near the wheels . " " Who said anything about pavement ? " the Sheriff said . " This here is a forty-foot right-of-way , and you 're on it . So I 'm telling you : pull over . " Since there was no place to pull over but into the fence , Deke hacked the car around into the bushes . Hooker followed him to insure the proper execution of his order . As Deke emerged he noticed that the Sheriff 's face had suddenly become livid ; Solomon , licking his chops , was paying his respects on the freshly blackened front tire of the squad car . For an instant the Sheriff viewed the act in speechless rage , his mouth contorting , the veined flesh of his face puffing and turning a deep , astonishing purple . Then he roared  --  a single wordless sound like the bellow of a bull . Solomon at once responded . In a joyful spring he was at the Sheriff 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean gray of his uniform . It was only after the Sheriff had scrambled behind the wheel and slammed the door that Deke was able to prevail upon Solomon to direct his attention elsewhere . " You know what that stuff does to rubber ? " Hooker shouted . " You know what that stuff does ? Rots it ! That 's what it does . Go run some water on it , quick ! " Deke fetched the hose . " Turn it on , turn it on ! " the Sheriff cried . " It is on , " Deke told him . " It 's just not getting any water , " " Let me see that thing , " the Sheriff said . Deke handed him the hose . The Sheriff inspected it , picked at the nozzle , shook it , and then for some reason decided to blow into it . At that moment , perhaps because taps up and down the street had been turned off to accommodate a general desire to see what was happening at B-$1/2 , the water pressure abruptly returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interior of the Sheriff 's car was a solid atmosphere of spray . Then like a wave breaking it settled , and the hose writhed on the ground . Deke rushed for the valve . Sputtering , the Sheriff poked his head out the window and brandished a dripping fist . " Boy , I 'm warning you , Dekker , " he said . " Here and now I 'm warning you . I know you and your two-faced kind . Like a hawk I 'm going to be watching you and that thing of yours . Break one law and I 'm having you both put away . " He gunned the motor , backed and roared out of the Canyon , looking very grim . Deke went inside with Solomon . T H E water pressure not only remained on , it remained on full and strong , a status explained by the fact that no one was doing anything but review the salient points of this latest legal development , and Deke spent the better part of the afternoon scrubbing walls and floors , carting out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ livable , less odoriferous . This task completed , he sat down with pencil and paper to draw a list of materials needed to make the cottage presentable . A rough tally indicated that a hundred dollars would cover . Accordingly , he went up the street to the Sure Enough in hopes of getting Ira to foot the bill in exchange for labor . Ira , however , happened to be in a rather troubled mood . Everything , including the john and pinball machines , was behaving capriciously . So when Deke walked in , gingerly crossed the sawdust floor , did not sit down at but leaned on the bar and announced in his best Sunday voice that he had given B-31/2 a fairly thorough once-over , the only reply Ira could muster was a dour " Congratulations . " 100 GUNFIGHT AT THE SURE ' ' Thank you , " Deke said , and took out his list . " What the hell is that ? " Ira said . " Some of the stuff I 'll need to fix the place you rented inc . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slicked down , and broke bathroom scales that did not go over two-fifty , rose from his stool by the cash register and put his face just close enough to Deke 's to permit the introduction of a threatening forefinger between their two noses . " Do n't give me no gas , " he said , " because I got all I can take in one day already . " He detailed his woes . Deke lowered himself onto a stool and screwed up his face sympathetically . " Rough go , " he said . " I mean , really rotten luck . " ' ' You ai n't just kidding , " Ira said , mollified . He took the list from Deke and checked each item . " I do n't get it , " he concluded . " You knew what the score was and you said OK . " " Oh , it 's OK , " Dcke said . " I 'd just like to do a little work on it and thought you might wish to put up the materials . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose it 's no use . " Ira was at once restored to his customary good spirits . " Tell you what , " he said . " You go ahead and square things away . The minute I get out from under Ill split fifty-fifty with you . That 's the best I can do . " " Well , " Deke said , and reviewed his cash position while he surveyed the juke box , the pinball machines , the beer signs , the tables and benches carved with initials . " All right , then , " he said , " fifty-fifty . " " It 's a deal , kid , " Ira said . " I mean it . " He moved over to the beer taps . " Small pitch ? " " Small what ? " Deke said . " Small or large pitcher of beer , " Ira said . Deke scratched his head . " To tell the truth , I was feeling more like a sr-nall coke , " he said . Inexplicably , Ira leaned forward on the taps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowered one hand . " I knew it , I knew it , " he said . B Y THE time Deke left the Sure Enough , Ira had taken pains , despite the small coke , to inquire about the incident with Hooker and reassure Deke that the Sheriff should never be taken seriously . While Dcke was fully prepared to accept the validity of this counsel , he could not escape a recurrent sense of uneasiness every-time he looked at Solomon . And in the following days , as he worked on the cottage , it became apparent that his uneasiness was to sonic extent justified : Solomon 's enthusiasm for the Sheriff ENOUGH was clearly on the ascendency , and as it waxed so did Hooker 's irritation . At first the evidence of it came in the form of notes left in the mailbox : instructions to keep the dog at home , off the street , away from children  --  these being accompanied by reference to the proximity of the pound , the Los Monos dog laws . The Sheriff seemed determined to devote a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He followed Hooker home , he performed natural functions not only on hooker 's car but also on his premises . The frequency of the incidents led Deke to resort to precautionary measures , such as shutting Solomon in the house , tying him in the backyard , keeping him constant company , or attempting to exhaust him with long walks , much throwing of sticks to be fetched . These were largely futile . Solomon not only seemed inexhaustible , he possessed an uncanny ability to escape any and all restrictive measures . He opened doors and windows , broke ropes , dug under fences . His neck being thicker than his head , he could shuck collars with ease ; the shape of his body permitted him to climb out of any harness . No matter what Deke did , he could sooner or later count on a phone call from Hooker  --  usually in the middle of the night or in the early morning , There would be the gruff announcement : " Your thing 's squeezing ' ern off on my lawn . " And Deke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had on several occasions endeavored to explain to Hooker that Solomon 's only response was to attention , and that if the Sheriff would kindly attempt to be less demonstrative , Solly would very soon leave him alone . This advice , however , infuriated Hooker . All advice infuriated him . Aware that the situation was getting out of hand , Deke was at a loss to know what to do . He could not talk sense to Hooker ; he could not count on assistance from the Canyon ; he had had no previous experience with anything remotely resembling the curious division that was placing him , his dog , the community , and the representative of law and order into disparate categories , isolated by a lack of any reasonable form of communication . Loving the dog is he did , he was prepared to make any sacrifice . But he had exhausted his ability to cope with things . and the impasse often filled him with brooding restlessness  --  particularly on still , hot afternoons when Solomon , in pursuit of cooler activities in the creek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just such an afternoon that Deke lost track of Solomon for well over three hours . 102 GUNFIGHT AT THE SURE ENOUGH He had already checked every possible area and finally returned to the Canyon in hopes that Sully might have wandered home . He had not . The green bowl of dog food under the sink was still full , untouched since morning . Deke emptied the soggy meal into the garbage pail . Through the window he heard a portable radio next door remark : " Oh and two the count , two men down , top of the third , Cincinnati leading San Francisco six to nothing . " Deke went out the back door , followed the sound through the bushes and came upon Too-Loose sprawled in a deck chair , his eyes covered by a wet washrag , the transistor radio on his stomach . A slim , good-looking boy , pale despite constant efforts to absorb sunlight , he had received his nickname as a result of his surname , Lautrec . " Have you seen Solomon ? " Deke inquired . Too-Loose raised a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said wearily , and lowered the rag . Ordinarily that would have been all Deke could have expected . To his surprise , Too-Loose suddenly seemed to have second thoughts about it . He switched off the portable , jerked aside the rag and sat up . " What was that ? " he asked . Deke repeated the question . " That 's what I thought you said , " Too-Loose observed . " Well , have you or have n't you ? " Deke said . Too-Loose shifted uneasily . " Gim me a weed . " Deke thrust a cigarette in his mouth and lighted it . " Thanks , " Too-Loose said . He inhaled deeply . " So what about Sully ? " Deke said . " Oh . Oh , yeah , " Too-Loose said , " I think he 's up at the Sure Enough , or something . I do n't know . " " See you , " Deke said , and headed for the Sure Enough , whistling . An answering bark , that sounded like Solomon nosing out a gopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He peered over the hedge and saw Mimi , in a bathing suit , pulling weeds with rubber gloves . She looked up . " Is Solomon here ? " he asked . " I thought I heard him bark . " " Oh , God , " Mimi said , " Was that you whistling ? Oh , God . I 'm sorry , Deke. 1 thought it was Too-Loose . I mean , I 'm awfully sorry . Really I am , believe me . " Deke , who had not heard Mimi say three words in 55 many weeks , was a bit taken back . " That 's all right , ' ' he said , " I just want to know have you seen Sully ? " To his utter amazement , Mimi 's eves widened and started to fill with tears . " You do n't believe me , " she said , and went into the house . He scratched his head , shrugged and went up to the Sure Enough . Ira was seated on a bar stool , leaning over a glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Giants on TV . As Deke pushed through the swinging door , the set announced : " And it 's a high pop fly . Blassingame over , makes the catch , and the side is retired . " " What the hell they trade Bias for ? " Ira inquired of the set . " Beats me , " Deke said , joining him . " IIave you seen that clog of mine ? " Ira did not reply . He turned , looked at Deke , then got up slowly and lumbered around the bar . " Small coke ? " Deke nodded . " Too-Loose thought Sully might be here . " " Got a message for you , " Ira said . He opened the coke and set it and a tumbler on the counter in front of Deke . " Ziff Tracey was just in looking for you . Said he 'd be right back and if you came in I was to tell you you was to wait . " " Ziff ? " Dckc said , puzzled . " What did he want ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and turned away . " How about a beef jerky ? " " Fine , " Deke said . He took out his wallet . " Forget it , kid , " Ira said . " This is on the house . " " Well , thanks , " Deke said . " What 's the oc-casion ? " " Giants losing , horses losing , stocks losing , I 'm losing . Somebody got to will now and again . " Deke grinned . " I 've been looking all over for that hound of mine , " he said . " Probably got himself cornered trying to corner someone 's cat , I guess . " " Yeah , sure , kid , " Ira said . " How come you ever got hooked on a pooch like that ? " " Oh , I do n't know , " Deke said . " It 's hard to say . He 's a good dog  --  best I ever had , in fact . And anyway , there are a lot of things about me that seem strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel sometimes , if that makes any sense . " Ira nodded thoughtfully . " How 's work going on the place ? " " Almost finished , " Deke said . " Only ran sixty dollars , too . Want to look it over ? " " Now , hell , " Ira said . " I can see from here it do n't look the same . And I was just thinking . Sixty is what you pay a month . Let 's say you already paid for next month . " " Why , thank you very much , Ira , " Deke said . " Aah , you earned it , kid . I seen you . " Deke was starting on a second coke when Ziff 104 GUNFIGHT AT THE SURE ENOUGH walked in . A tall , wry sophomore , Ziff was a man whose grin dominated his face , whose sense of humor dominated his personality . Of all the people in the Canyon , he had been least standoffish with Deke . He also had a way of coming straight to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hooker shot your dog . Ira laid him out back until I could find you . " The breath caught in Deke 's throat , and for an instant all he could do was stare at Ziff . Then he set his coke down , rose , and crossed the room to the side door that opened onto what Ira called his backyard . Solomon lay on the grass under an old live oak . Deke knelt by him and placed a hand under his muzzle . He was unmarked except for a small hole slightly below and behind one eye . " Old Sol , " Deke said , and raised the dog tender ly in his arms . " Dear old Sol . " Ira came out the door . " It was with one of them compressed-air things , " he said apologetically . " I did n't know he was bad hurt till he fell down . Nothing I could do , kid . Damn good dog , if you ask me . " " Thank you , " Deke said thickly . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enough and returned to his own backyard where he dug and filled the grave . Then he went inside , took a bath , and locked himself in his room . H IS light was seen burning most of the night ; his shadow crossed and recrossed the lowered window shade . Although the Canyon was immersed in its normal Saturday evening activities , much of the discussion was devoted to the killing of Solomon . There were many loud references to Hooker as a sexual deviate , and a host of crafty methods of retaliation were advanced , elaborated upon , and dismissed as unsatisfactory . The main consensus of opinion appeared to be that Deke , being what he was , lacked the necessary wherewithal to assume command of the situation and therefore , as a gesture of neighborliness , it should be assumed for him . Suggestions ranged from Mimi 's idea of writing letters implicating Hooker before the House Un-American Activities Committee to Ziff 's desire to tar and feather the man . But by morning no decision had been reached , and as Deke 's light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was adjourned again the following night , and on Monday morning Deke came out , Judging from his behavior , he had something definite in mind : he proceeded directly to his car and drove off . Several hours later he returned and wentinto the house . He was seen carrying some sort of suspicious-looking package , and the word at once went out that a showdown was in the works . When he reappeared there was no doubt as to what form this showdown would take . Dressed in denims , he had strapped to his waist a gun belt and holster . A second belt and weapon he held in his hand . For a moment he stood in the street , checking the cylinders of both forty-fives . Then he rolled the other revolver in its belt and headed for the Sure Enough , where he ordered a glass of beer . " What you aiming to do , kid ? " Ira asked . Deke placed the spare belt on the bar . " Give me the beer and keep out of my way , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ira said . " It ai n't that I do n't like you and all , or that I do n't know how you feel about the dog . " " Eight years I had Solomon , " Dcke said , " and no one minded . Eight years . " " You do n't have to tell me that , kid , " Ira said . " It 's just that I do n't want no trouble here . " " Are you going to draw that beer , " Deke said , " or do I have to make you ? " Ira drew the beer . " Now call the Sheriff , " Deke said , " anti tell him you caught someone writing dirty words in the head . " Ira hesitated . " Go on , " Dckc said , " I mean it . " " All right , kid , all right , " Ira said , and placed the call . A few moments later the wail of the Sheriff 's police siren was heard . People began hurrying into the Sure Enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the time the Sheriff arrived there was a small crowd awaiting him . He drove directly up to the door , siren screaming , and got out . In the ensuing silence the ticking of the wall clock was audible . Dcke sat alone at the bar . He did not look around as the Sheriff banged open the door , strode up to Ira and asked all right , who was the dirty-minded bathroom artist . " Right over here , Sheriff , " Deke said , still not turning . The Sheriff looked down the bar at him and straightened . " Well , well , " he said . " If it is n't Mr. Good-boy himself . Caught in the act . " He moved toward Deke . " Come on , fella , let 's go . " " Says who ? " Deke said . " What do you mean , ' Says who ? ' " the Sheriff said . " I 'm placing you under arrest . " Deke turned and put a foot on the floor so chat the forty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . A STORY BY ROBIN WHITE 103 The Sheriff wet his lips and looked around . " You got a license to carry that ? " " Nope , " Deke said . " And I do n't have a license for this one , either . " He pushed the second belt toward the Sheriff . " Put it on . " " I did n't come here to play any games , " the Sheriff said . " Neither did 1 , " Deke said . He rose . " Put it on . " The Sheriff touched the gun but still did not appear to relish the idea of donning it . " I 'm counting to five , " Deke said , He started counting . At two the Sheriff hastily buckled the belt around his waist . Any time you 're ready , " Deke said . " Look , " the Sheriff said , " leave us nor be hasty but just sort of talk it over .

" It was a mistake . An accident . " " You got Solomon to come to you and put the gun right to his head , " Deke said . " But it was an accident , " the Sheriff said . " I did n't mean the gun to go off . " " Just slipped your mind that it was loaded , " Deke said . " Believe me , " the Sheriff said . " I really did n't mean it to go off .

" Well , " he said , " in that case I guess I have no cause to shoot you . " Slowly he replaced his forty-five and sat down at the bar . As he raised his glass , someone shouted , " Look out !

An instant later the sound of the Sheriff 's rage filled the room . " I 'll see you do time for this ! " he roared . " I 'm going to go peaceably , Sheriff , " Deke said . " I certainly am , But if you do n't mind I 'd like to call my lawyer first and tell him I got caught dueling and writing things in a public latrine . Of course , the papers may be interested to know something about the guns being loaded with flags . and the bathroom not having any writing on the walls , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about accidentally shooting Solomon .

" He finished his beer . " Hand Inc the phone , Ira . " " Yes , sir , Mr. Dekker , " Ira said . " One phone coming up . " Deke did not have to dial . The Sheriff turned and left . For a moment there was silence . Too-Loose was first to break it . Rushing up to the bar , he clapped Deke on the shoulder , practically knocking the phone from his hands . " HoIy-o-crow ! " he cried happily . " Man , what a stroke of genius !
