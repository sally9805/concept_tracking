In the velvet darkness the posse of 16 white men crouched noiselessly at the jungle 's edge . Just beyond , in a clearing , glowed the campfires of their prey : a tiny band of Brazilian Indians whose men had clubbed to death , in a reprisal raid , a white rubber tapper who had killed one of their tribe . When the campfires ebbed and the Indians had settled into sleep , the posse struck-with shotguns , machetes and vicious dogs . No one was spared . In a few minutes , 22 men , 18 women and 12 children lay dead . The posse cut off three heads as trophies , and left as silently as they had come . <P> This recent slaughter was yet another grisly incident in a mortal struggle against cruelty and civilization that has been going on in Brazil for more than 400 years . Like the North American Indian before him , the Brazilian Indian 's enemy is the white man-and the white man 's ways . Throughout the country 's vast and still largely untamed jungle , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Pedro Cabral discovered Brazil in 1,500 , the lush tropical land teemed with 3,000,000 Indians of some 2,500 tribes . Today its tribal Indian population is down to an estimated 78,000 and falling steadily every year . <P> " Like Cattle . " The proud and handsome Caraja nation has dwindled in two centuries from 500,000 to 1,200 , and its domain , which once stretched 870 miles from northern Mato Grosso to the sea , has shrunk to the shores of a jungle island . Of the Pau d'Arcos , some 3,000 strong at the beginning of the century , a lone survivor remains-an old woman wearing out her days as a stranger in another tribe . Many tribes , among them the Amoipiras and the Potiguaras , live only in the history books . <P> Brazil 's history is studded with examples of unspeakable cruelty to the dark-skinned natives who lived there uncounted centuries before Cabral . Early Portuguese colonizers enslaved natives by the thousands to work the sugar plantations , butchered whole tribes as a warning to others . Jesuit missionaries , serving as the Indians ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herding them into new settlements so that their lands could be more easily confiscated . Dreaded mame-luko* raiders-crossbreeds of Portuguese and native blood-disguised as priests , swept down on the missions to carry off their congregations , sometimes killing the Jesuit fathers as well . " The captives were led away , chained and corded , like herds of cattle . " wrote one missionary in a horrified letter home . " Suckling babes were torn from the bosoms of their mothers and cruelly dashed upon the ground . The aged and diseased were either cut down or shot . " In 130 years of terror , the mamelukos are said to have killed ( though such old statistics are suspect ) 2,300.000.
