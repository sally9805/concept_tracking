Arthur Kopit , the young Harvard graduate whose play Oh Dad , Poor Dad , Mamma 's Hung You in the Closet and I 'm Feeling So Sad is one of off-Broadway 's most durable current hits , once wrote a play called Aubade . But he is not the sort of fellow who would make that mistake twice . His middle period , when he was about 21 a few months back , was notable for a three-acter called On the Runway of Life You Never Know What 's Coming Off Next , a play that unfortunately contained its entire essence in the title and was never professionally produced . But now Kopit has prepared a new script for production next month off-Broadway , and Dad-wise he is only half a dozen picas off the peak . The new play , scheduled to go into Greenwich Village 's Theatre de Lys , is called Asylum or What the Gentlemen Are Up To Not to Mention the Ladies .                    @
