As Republican Mayor John Lindsay and Democratic Senator Robert Kennedy chatted together last week in front of New York City 's Gracie Mansion , the mayor 's official residence , it took only a flicker of fantasy to imagine that they were standing in the White House portico , circa 1972 . It was almost a case of take-your-pick . Dressed alike in dark suits and rep ties-only the breastpocket handkerchief set Harvardman Kennedy apart from Yaleman Lindsay-both exuded all the youth , intelligence and patrician good looks a voter could hope for . Though mere commoners in their respective parties , the mayor and the Senator each had about him a certain look of political inevitability . <P> For all their surface similarities , the two men are markedly different . Kennedy is coldly pragmatic , Lindsay stubbornly principled . Where Kennedy has a sharper wit , the mayor has an easier humor . While Lindsay is taller and undeniably handsomer , Bobby has The Name . Though both wear an affluent air and came into family money-an immense advantage for a man with political ambitions-neither is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a peculiarity of American political reporting that only self-made men are generally labeled " rich . " ( Actually , Lindsay 's total $140,000 inheritance is exceeded by the annual return alone on Bobby 's fortune of perhaps $15 million . ) What brought them together , after they patched up an unseemly fracas over whether Lindsay had been rude to Kennedy , is a proposition on the November ballot for voter approval of Lindsay 's new civilian-dominated police-review board , which has come under heavy attack by conservatives who consider it a crimp in police efficiency . Lindsay and Kennedy , together with New York 's elder statesman , G.O.P. Senator Jacob Javits , have joined forces to support the board . It is the kind of impeccable cause that neither of the look-alike liberals can afford to pass up - in 1966 or 1972.
