They came from North Carolina ( like Jimmie Hall ) , and they were working behind a big old plow horse when they were 6 ( like Jimmie Hall ) . Hall still has plenty of the farm left in him , even if he does now represent Greater Bloomington . His name is Jimmie ( not James ) , he prefers hillbilly music and he still has trouble with store-bought suits  --  he only weighs 178 with a 32-inch waist , but his coat size is 44 to 46 . Outfielder Hall played in just 54 minor league games the last two years , but the Twins saw those muscles and put him in the infield in a winter league to hide him from the draft . Back in the outfield this spring , Hall forced regular Center Fielder Lenny Green to the bench . Coming from below .200 , Hall hit .281 in June . July looks even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 11 RBIs . Green is already worrying about a pay cut . // THE TEAM Only some things change . Last week the last-place Senators won seven games in a row  --  but still managed to look like the last-place Senators . The last time they won seven games in a row the Senators were also a last-place team  --  and Shortstop Ed Brinkman was 7 ? years old . Washington had not even won six straight since 1954 , and this time they did not exactly bludgeon the enemy to death . They won one game when the A 's made three errors in the same inning . They won two others without hitting the ball  --  once on a balk , once on a walk . The pitchers were more consistent . Benny Daniels threw two complete games , Don Rudolph a third . Steve Ridzik  --  the old Phillie  --  got a call back to the big time again and pitched a seven-inning three-hitter . When Don Leppert doubled in a run in the 10th , Ron Kline gained his first victory . ( It goes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has seven saves among them . ) It all made the Senators a much happier crew . Leppert even took to defending the All-Star selections of Yankee Manager Ralph Houk . " I think that Houk is magnificent , a fine judge of talent , " Leppert said . Houk had just named Leppert to the All-Star team . // NATIONAL LEAGUE // THE PLAYER Johnny Podres has had an odd career . Starting with his first season with the Dodgers in 1953 , he has had 62 wins and 37 losses in odd-numbered years ; during even-numbered years Podres has won 53 games and lost 47 . His 2.66 ERA was the best in the league in 1957 , and his .783 winning percentage was tops in 1961 . There has been one exception  --  in 1955 when he had a 9-10 record . Yet that was his finest year , for Podres led the Dodgers to their first world championship by twice beating the Yankees . This being 1963 , it was disturbing that Podres finished only five of his first 15 starts and had a 4-6 record . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts in June . He lasted two-thirds of an inning in one game , one-third in the other . Then came July , an odd-numbered month . On the first and fifth days of the month , Podres was superb , beating the Braves 2-1 on five hits and then the Reds 1-0 on two singles . Suddenly everything was going fine for Podres , oddly enough . // THE TEAM In the inimitable language of Casey Stengel , last week 's intracity charity game between the Chicago Cubs and White Sox was an " extravagance . " For the Cubs , who won , it was exhilarating , especially since it was 17 years ago that they last finished higher in the final standing of the National League than their crosstown rivals in the American . Long accustomed to being the " other " team in town , the Cubs and their fans often behaved like ostriches . This year they are holding their heads high . Among the most ardent rooters is the seven-year-old son of Bob Kennedy , manager of the Cubs . " The first thing he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of first place the Cubs are , " says Mrs. Kennedy . After five straight wins last week they were in second place , three games out ( the White Sox were third ) . Timely , if infrequent , hitting and excellent pitching made them winners . " Winning the pennant has n't even entered my mind , " Kennedy says . It has entered the mind of Athletic Director Bob Whitlow , however . Following the win over the White Sox , Whitlow said to Sox General Manager Ed Short , " That was fun . Let 's do it again in October . " That would really be an extravagance .
