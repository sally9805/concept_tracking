Ending a three-year absence from their official residence , Prime Minister Macmillan and Lady Dorothy moved back into No. 10 Downing Street last week . But if their new tenure was uncertain , there was no mistaking the uproar over the remodeling project-one of the bureaucratic epics of modern British history . <P> Home for British Prime Ministers since 1735 , No. 10 Downing has never been anyone 's dream house . Jerry-built half a century earlier as a private residence by a Harvard-educated speculator , Sir George Downing , the Whitehall relic , four stories high , so depressed Melbourne that he refused to set foot in it . Haughty Margot Asquith called it " squalid , " Lloyd George 's wife would not move in until adequate plumbing was installed . During the blitz , Churchill complained that it was " shaky . " One ancient boiler heated both Nos. 10 and 11 , residence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer , leading then-Chancellor Rab Butler to complain that when Churchill set the thermostat in the 70s or 80s , he , Butler , was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee announced that the " full horror " of No. 10 Downing Street had become apparent , warned that the place was so dilapidated that the Macmillans were in imminent danger of crashing through the floor into the old air-raid shelter below . Hurriedly , the occupants moved around the corner to Admiralty House , and a top-to-bottom interior overhaul began on Nos. 10 , 11 and 12 ( the latter is home for the P.M. 's Party Whip ) . The initial timetable was two years ; the initial cost estimate : $1,100,000 . <P> As workmen peered closer , the horror got worse . Most rooms , it turned out , had to have new ceilings . Ornate 18th century cornices needed tedious repair and cleaning-with 40 coats of paint removed from some . Behind the paneling a two-inch-wide crack was found spreading through the brickwork . <P> <P> The project turned into a political target for labor leaders , was hit by 14 strikes . Because of haste in starting , the government did not even bother to take overall bids , proceeded on a piecemeal , cost-plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnishings , thanks to Harold and Dorothy Macmillan , hardly the types to let their imaginations run riot . They ordered everything " very plain and simple , " vetoed damask and brocade for the walls , had the bedroom done in chintz . Last week , with the renovation finally finished more than a year behind schedule , the total bill stood at an astronomical $8,500,000 . <P> And judging from the comment , few taxpayers were satisfied . The floors still slant , and the walls still lean as much as ten inches , but Architect Raymond Erith confidently assured everyone : " We 've hooked it up good and proper and it wo n't fall down .
