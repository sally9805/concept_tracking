Despite the impressive skills of modern science , the way to discover profitable mineral deposits around the Mediterranean often seems to be to curl up with a good book . Perusing the Greek classics and pinpointing their references . Italian Entrepreneur Jean-Baptiste Serpieri in 1864 rediscovered the ancient mines of Laurium near Athens , from which the classical Athenians extracted their wealth and the lead needed to build their fleet . Geologist Charles Godfrey Gunther located copper on Cyprus by reading Latin manuscripts . The latest to cash in on the classics is a short , stocky Greek named Alexander Xenarios , who spent 30 years roaming Greece and making minor finds before he hit the jackpot : a deposit in northern Greece 's Chalcidice district estimated to be able to yield 200,000 tons of copper and 60 tons of gold . <P> Xenarios , 57 , made most of his earlier finds by reading the classics , including Demosthenes ' orations and Aristotle , and listening to local folklore in his travels through Greece . Then he became fascinated by references to the Chalcidice peninsula in Strabo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to weapons , jewelry and coins made in the Chalcidice-and guessed that this indicated a sizable local lode of metal . He reasoned that much of the metal would still be in the earth , since the early Greeks had primitive mining machinery and thus could dig only shallow mines . Xenarios finally homed in on a region known as Skouries ( meaning " deposits of rust " ) which had the typical copper field 's tree-barren look . By careful exploration , he located the ancient mines . <P> Xenarios got some small financial backing from a friend to set up the Chalcidice Mining Co. , received a grant for further explorations from the Greek government . Japan 's Nippon Mining Co. joined up with the company for a $350,000 exploratory expedition , last week had a team of Japanese experts working over the deposits . If the Japanese are satisfied by the find , they promise to put up $3,000,000 to form a new company with Chalcidice Mining , buy the copper output and ship it to Japan . Xenarios confidently expects a top position in the new company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reading . " Ancient texts , " he says , " are good for modern business . "
