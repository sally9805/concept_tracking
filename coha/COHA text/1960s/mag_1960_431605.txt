 | THE CHANCES FOR PEACE @# HOW GREAT is the danger of a third world war ? Conversely , what are the chances of a long period of peace ? or at least a period without major nuclear war ? This reporter has asked these questions of some of the wisest and most experienced men in Paris , Berlin , London , Washington . And everywhere , astonishingly , the answers have been essentially the same : " There will be no great world war in the foreseeable future . And the present strange state of not-peace , not-war may last for generations . " The wisest and most experienced of men can , of course , be very wrong . What is astonishing is their unanimity in the face of all the evidence which , by the standards of any previous epoch in history , would clearly suggest that a great war wa not only inevitable but imminent How is it that they do not believe there is really very much risk war ? Ask one of the two or three dozer men who make policy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get some such answer as , " Well , suppose it 's a matter of instinct . " Instinct , mind you , has its uses Some ten years ago I spent an ud forgettable four or five hours wit Winston Churchill at Chartwell , hi country place . Stalin was then in hi last terrible years of tyranny and more even than today , every sigi H THE CHANCES FOR PEACE 149 pointed to the danger of a third world war . Churchill , musing on e world scene , acknowledged that is was so , comparing the situation the late 1930 's when Adolf Hitler as whipping the world toward Armageddon . " And yet , " said Churchill thoughtfully , " it is very odd . Then I knew there was going to be a great war . lay I do not feel a great war in y bones . " Despite a decade on the brink , the Churchillian feeling in the bones has proved correct , as so often bere . With a good many of the West 's policy makers , the feeling at there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bones ? and their bones , of course , could rove less reliable than Winston Churchill 's . But there are more solid reasons for believing that the third , and perhaps final , world war will not occur in the near future . In examining these reasons , the place to start is inside the bald , bull-shaped head of Nikita Khruschev . One " Kremlinologist " holds wt there is a rough parallel becell the Soviet leader and the star a play . Obviously the actor 's interpretation of the lead role is vitally important . But it is the author who supplies the actor 's lines . At last lay 's abortive summit meeting in Paris , President Eisenhower , after listening to Khrushchev 's tirade on U-2 , mildly remarked that the Soviets , after all , had done a lot of ying , too . " As God is my witKhrushchev cried , holding his pudgy hands aloft , " my hands are clean and my heart is pure . " These lines were , in effect , written for him by the doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done to promote the inevitable global triumph of Communism is good . Thus , by his own lights , Khrushchev 's hands are clean , despite the fact that Soviet espionage is on the most massive scale known to history . His heart is pure , although he has been personally responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of people , from Ukraine to Budapest . In Khrushchev 's eyes , all that he has done has been done in Communism 's noble cause , and is thus noble in itself . By our standards this is a kind of madness . Khrushchev is ideologically mad , if you will , as Hitler was . But Khrushchev is not insane in a clinical sense , as Hitler certainly was . There is another meaningful difference between Khrushchev and Hitler . Whereas Hitler 's " thousandyear Reich " had to be won by conquest in Hitler 's own lifetime , there is no deadline for the global triumph of Communism . Khrushchev is not in a hurry . These two differences between Khrushchev and Hitler were demonstrated dramatically soon after Khrushchev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the summit meeting . There were good reasons for supposing that Khrushchev intended to  | carry out immediately his threat to sign a separate peace with the East Germans . The best reason is West Berlin itself , which Khrushchev once described as a " cancer in my throat . " Anyone who wants to understand why should visit the Marienfelde refugee camp , in a dingy suburb of Berlin , where the most recent arrivals from Communist Germany are housed . Some 3,500,000 refugees have come to West Berlin since the war . They flee because they can no longer bear the inhuman atmosphere of Communism . Of course Berlin is a cancer in Khrushchev 's throat ; it makes lies of all his boasts . And what is more , the existence of free West Berlin makes it impossible for Khrushchev 's German puppets , Ulbricht and Grotewohl , fully to consolidate their Communist regime . Eastern Europe in turn can never be fully consolidated in the Soviet empire until East Germany is stabilized . This is enough to suggest how glittering a prize West Berlin is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to be quite different from the Khrushchev of Paris of a few days before . Now he was solemn , serious , soft-spoken , statesmanlike . The Berlin situation , he told a bitterly disappointed audience of East German Communists , should be allowed to " ripen " for at least " six to eight months . " Why this new and milder Khrushchev ? In Berlin I got two overlapping answers to that question ? one from an English Communist in the Soviet sector , the other from West Berlin 's extraordinarily able mayor , Willy Brandt . The English Communist , who went over to the East Germans some ten years ago , is remarkably freespoken for a Communist . He knew there would be no Berlin crisis , he said with a laugh , as soon as he saw the street signs being changed from " For an immediate peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic and a demilitarized West Berlin " to " For total disarmament for all the world . " That was the tip-off that the line had changed , said the Englishman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ K realized , he said , that there was no chance for a deal on Berlin . He had promised to sign a separate peace with East Germany if the summit failed . But he did n't want to risk it , and the U-2 gave him an excellent reason for not having any summit meeting at all . " So he has just put Berlin on ice . " But how long will it stay on ice ? Mayor Brandt is one of those who think Berlin may be on ice indefinitely . What Khrushchev really wants , says Brandt , is a peace treaty with both Germanys , signed by all the great powers . " Then Khrushchev could say to the Poles and the Czechs , You must now accept for all time that Moscow is the place you belong to . ' " Khrushchev , Brandt believes , is simply trying to use the threat of a separate peace with East Germany as a lever . But  | suppose the lever does n't work , and Khrushchev then signs a peace treaty with his East German puppets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to people not qualified to accept them . And what does he get ? New dangers , perhaps another explosion . " Brandt is convinced that Berlin is a very tough nut for Khrushchev to crack . Theoretically , the East German Communists could strangle Berlin by cutting off access to the West . But might not the West start shooting before Berlin is strangled to death ? Is Khrushchev , in short , ready to risk war ? Western policy makers answer that Khrushchev does not want to take any major risk of nuclear war ? not consciously , not by design , not now . To understand their reasons , consider the famous U-2 flights. * They gave us a picture ? quite literally ? of Soviet military and industrial dispositions that more conventional espionage methods could never have provided . More important , they made a liar out of the Soviet scientist who once explained to an American colleague in Geneva why the Soviets would win the next war : " We know where your missile bases are , and you do n't know where ours are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which could be decisive . For the present we do know where the Soviet missile bases are , and above all we know that the So- viet air defenses are not invulnerable and that our Strategic Air Command can get through to the targets recorded on the U-2 's supersensitive films . Khrushchev knows this . That is the chief reason he does not want to risk a major war . It was essentially for the same reason that Winston Churchill had that feeling in his bones ten years ago . He told the House of Commons at the time : " Hopes of a speedy and splendid victory with all its excitement are now superseded by a preliminary stage of measureless agony from which neither side could at present protect itself . Moralists may find it a melancholy thought that peace can find no nobler foundations than mutual terror . But , for my part , I shall be content if these foundations are solid . " That " peace of mutual terror " is the peace we have today . It is quite unlike the genuine peace , based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleetingly known , notably in the 19th century . Barring a total overturn of the Communist system , we shall never know that sort of peace , nor will our children or our children 's children . You can not make a genuine world settlement with those whose stated objective is to destroy everything you believe in . The peace of mutual terror is , moreover , a frighteningly fragile peace . It could be broken by miscalculation or by madness . The time may even be coming when the insanity or simple human error of a  | Maj. John Smith or a Capt . Ivan Ivanovitch , his finger on a nuclear trigger , could spark a nuclear exchange . Yet the fact remains : under the sheltering terror of the nuclear weapons , the fragile peace has somehow remained unbroken for a long time now . The final clash between the hostile blocs , which history has taught us to expect , has not occurred . Perhaps , just perhaps , our fragile , frightening peace , which is after all very much better than no peace at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " perhaps " is not to explode into the horror of a nuclear world war , certain conditions must clearly be met . SAC can get through today . But SAC , or its missile equivalent , must always be able to get through . Nor is that all . Khrushchev must be genuinely convinced that our nuclear power will , if necessary , be used . In the opinion of one of the best-informed men in Europe , we were closer to war a few months before the summit than we have ever been . Khrushchev had concluded , he believes , that we would surrender Berlin rather than risk a nuclear war , and he therefore came within an ace of forcing the Berlin collision . He was only persuaded that the West might fight for Berlin as a result of his meeting with General de Gaulle in Paris in the spring . To this there is a corollary . History has not taken an about-turn . People are fighting one another today on an organized basis , as they have since history was first recorded , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandchildren . The lesson is clear . We must have what today we largely lack : the means to fight less-than-total wars with lessthan-total weapons . Finally , and perhaps in the long run most important , we must also find the means and the will to give poor countries and poor people a practical alternative to Communism . Yet surely it is not impossible for these conditions to be met by the Western alliance , the richest and potentially the most powerful concert of nations in history . If they are met , in the judgment of the wise and well-informed men to whom I have talked since the Paris debacle , it really is not too much to hope that there will be no global nuclear war in our lifetimes , and perhaps for very much longer than that . Perhaps there will never be one . @#
