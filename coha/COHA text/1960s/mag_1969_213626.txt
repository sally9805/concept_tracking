Even the modest projects of Japan 's Akira Kurosawa are conceived and executed on a grand scale . Whether his subject is history ( Seven Samurai ) , social commentary ( The Bad Sleep Well ) , classic drama ( The Lower Depths ) or thriller ( High and Low ) , Kurosawa invests each film with the breadth of an epic vision . Taken together , his films are like a single , vivid morality play , often heroic and sometimes cynical , celebrating the triumph of man over circumstance . <P> The audience for Kurosawa films in the U.S. has been severely limited by the vagaries of film distribution . Although Rashomon became an art-house staple after it won an Academy Award in 1951 , most of Kurosawa 's other films have not found their way to many American screens . Red Beard , like Pierrot Le Fou first shown in 1965 but just released in New York , is being presented at a special foreign-language theater with only a whisper of publicity . Thus , filmgoers across the country may once again miss a masterpiece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Why , and What . Red Beard is an oriental Pilgrim 's Progress . In 19th century Japan , an ambitious young doctor ( Yuzo Kayama ) pays a formal call on the director of a public-health clinic . There he is shocked to find that he has been given a post as a mere intern . <P> Stung by the indignity of the assignment , he rebels against the hospital rules , refuses to wear a uniform and grows careless of his patients ' needs . Only the silent , looming presence of the head of the clinic , who has been nicknamed Red Beard , prevents the irate young man from quitting altogether . " This place is terrible , " a fellow intern tells the young man . " The patients are all slum people ; they 're full of fleas - they even smell bad . Being here makes you wonder why you ever wanted to be come a doctor . " It is through Red Beard ( Toshiro Mifune ) that the young doctor learns not only why but what , in a full metaphorical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> An array of human wreckage straggles through the clinic in motley procession : a homicidal schizophrenic who was repeatedly raped and beaten at the age of nine ; a wheelwright working even as he dies in penance for an imagined evil ; a young girl , orphaned and being kept captive by syphilitic whores . Their tragedies begin gradually to touch the young doctor until , at film 's end , he finally tells Red Beard that he wants to remain at the clinic . " You 'll regret it , " grumbles Red Beard , turning to hide his pleasure . <P> Lapidary Care . As for plot , Red Beard could be Dr. Gillespie , and the intern Dr. Kildare : the story is that simple . But where his hero is a physician , Kurosawa is a metaphysician . Going beneath the bathos , he explores his characters ' psychology until their frailties and strengths become a sum of humanity itself . Despite his pretensions , the young doctor is as flawed-and believable-as his patients . If Red Beard himself is a heroic figure , he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes violent-as when he forcibly takes the girl from her captors-he keeps the clinic open by such inglorious expedients as coercion and extortion . Kurosawa seems to share with Red Beard the knowledge that the price of compassion is often compromise .
