txt Astronauts can do a lot of work outside their spaceships if they are properly . tied to the job . A few handholds , footholds , or tethers will prevent such tasks as tightening or loosening a bolt from becoming a physically punishing exercise . Maj. Edwin Aldrin 's smooth performance , which proved this Sunday , is one of the major accomplishments of the Gemini 12 flight . It enables the Gemini team to give future astronauts the assurance that working outside their ships is a practical technique to consider in planning their missions . Limitations breached Much still needs to be learned about extra vehicular activity ( EVA , to use the stiffly formal space engineer 's ' term ) . But Dr. Charles Berry , director of medical research and operations at the Manned Space ' . craft Center , says enough has been learned to know there is no physiological limitation to prevent astronauts doing useful work in EVA spacesuits under the weightless conditions of orbital flight . On some earlier Gemini flights , astronauts became exhausted in trying to do this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a propulsion unit like astronaut Edward H. White 's hand gun was fairly easy . But Eugene A. Cernan ( Gemini 9 ) and Richard Gordon ( Gemini 11 ) wore themselves out trying to manipulate things such as bolts and to move about the outside of their spacecraft without proper handholds . Much of their energy went into trying to get into position , and to hold their bodies in position to do useful work . Also , Gemini astronauts found that , without a propulsion unit of some kind , they were fairly helpless when floating away from the spaceship . They could pull themselves back to the hatch of the ship by the tether . But they could neither control their orienta* // *Gemini EVA pessimism banished // tion nor move to a specific place by manipulating the tether . Dr. Berry explained that the problems these astronauts faced have centered around three things . ? They have to work against a suit that is stiff and awkward to move because it is heavy and inflated . ? The ' astronauts are up against the physics of weightlessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move and they tend to drift away or spin too . ? The space suit chest pack can handle up to 2,000 btu 's ( British thermal units ) of heat an hour . If an astronaut works hard enough to generate more heat than that , heat and moisture build up in the suit . This happened to both Astronauts Cernan and Gordon . Planning works out Neither the suit nor the chest pack that ventilated it could be redesigned for the Gemini 12 flight . In fact , Dr. Berry said that the Gemini EVA suit represents " the ultimate of the art of suit design as it is today . " However , by planning the EVA tasks to take account of suit limitations , the effort of working in it can be reduced . Giving the astronaut enough hand holds and footholds and tethers to help keep his body oriented for work should further reduce the work load .

Exploring this area of EVA will challenge future astronauts . But the basic feasibility of such EVA works has been shown . " This kind of environment is n't going to offer an eight-hour working day , " Dr. Berry said , " Yet I really do n't think we 've reached a physiological limit we ca n't handle if we properly plan the task . " At his work station in the adapter ( rear ) section of Gemini 12 , Astronaut Aldrin had two short body tethers and handholds . He also had a pair of " golden slippers " ? plastic foot guards gilded to adjust their heat radiating properties . In these he braced his feet . He had handholds and body tethers for work at the nose of Gemini 12 and at the docking cone of the Agena in which the spaceship 's nose fitted while docked . With these aids , the astronaut went through a number of practice jobs . He loosened and tightened bolts , put as much torque as he could on a fixed bolt , unfastened and refastened various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal shears . He also fixed a line from the Agena to the nose of Gemini 12 . Comparison marked Astronaut Gordon knocked himself out trying to do jobs like these . Astronaut Aldrin turned in a " no sweat " performance . Flight Director Clifford C. Charlesworth said that " he was totally in command of the situation at all times . . . . I think that he accomplished all of the tasks that we had laid out to do . "
