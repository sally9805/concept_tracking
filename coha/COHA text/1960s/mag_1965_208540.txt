U.S. playgrounds with their slick stretches of asphalt , colorful , convoluted slides and free-form sculptures for climbing , are among the world 's safest , cleanest and most indestructible . But are they what children want ? Of course not , says Lady Allen of Hurtwood , 68 , a prominent British landscape architect and president of the World Organization for Early Childhood Education . After a month 's survey of the East Coast 's showpiece playgrounds , the no-nonsense dowager observed crisply that they are " an administrator 's heaven and a child 's hell . " Said she : " It is time we decide whether our playgrounds are to be designed for adults , who love to be neat , or for children , who love to be dirty . " <P> Even at Washington 's John F. Kennedy Playground , which is considered one of the best in the U.S. , Lady Allen faulted the elaborate array of model jet planes , trolleys , Coast Guard tugs and fire engines , none of which can be moved . " The successful playground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can move things around and make them obedient to their own wills . " <P> Lady Allen 's answer is the " adventure playground . " Instead of flat asphalt , the lot ideally should have hills , grass and puddles . Its main features are : 1 ) a central pavilion where young children could keep out of the rain during the day and teen-agers could hold meetings at night , and 2 ) enough lumber , bricks , rope , pipes , hammers and nails to keep the kids busy . With a minimum of supervision , they would build tree houses , hideaways , swings-or just mud castles-and cook their own meals over an outdoor fire . <P> Lady Allen got the idea on a 1945 visit to Copenhagen , where a Danish landscape architect had created an immensely popular playground by stocking a lot with building materials . It looked like a junkyard . Back home , she organized committees to take over old bomb sites and equip them in the same way . The kids thought that they were the best thing since ice cream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozens more in Sweden , Denmark and Switzerland . <P> Insurance-conscious U.S. architects object that boards , bricks and nails are dangerous playthings . On the contrary , says Lady Allen , accidents are less frequent in her playgrounds than in conventional asphalt lots , probably because immovable playthings " bore children and breed a sort of mass hysteria . " Anyway , she adds , " it is better to risk a broken leg than a broken spirit . A leg can always mend . A spirit may not . "
