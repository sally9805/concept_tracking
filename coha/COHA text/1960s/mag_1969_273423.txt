In many ways , the most successful modern American industrial enterprise is International Business Machines Corp . Its primary field , high-speed data processing , is barely 20 years old , but IBM has risen to rank among the ten biggest U.S. companies , with 1968 sales of $6.9 billion and profits of $871 million . With a reputation for excellent technology , marketing and servicing , it dominates the computer business at home and abroad . The company 's smoothly aggressive and generously rewarded salesmen have captured about 74% of the U.S. market . Investors value IBM 's prospects so highly that its 112.7 million shares are worth a total of $34.6 billion - far more than G.M. , A.T . &; T. or any other U.S. company . <P> Bargaining Point . IBM 's future has been based on its computers and its competitive prowess . Now the future may depend on the courts . Last month the company was charged with monopolistic practices in a civil antitrust suit brought by a competitor , Control Data Corp . Two weeks ago IBM was the target of another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; General Corp . And last week IBM was hit by the most important suit of all . The Justice Department climaxed a long investigation by bringing its own antitrust action-the biggest of the Johnson era-against the company . <P> In a broadly worded eight-page brief filed in Manhattan 's Federal District Court , the trustbusters charged IBM with blocking competitors from " an adequate opportunity to compete . " One complaint was that companies that sell only hardware or software or maintenance services could not easily win customers because IBM offered the whole package at a single price . For certain customers , such as universities , the suit continued , IBM set unreasonably low prices in order to crush competitors . The suit also charged that IBM had quashed the sales prospects of newly developed rival machines by simply announcing new products of its own-even though production was a long way off . That echoed a Control Data complaint that sales of one new computer model had suffered when IBM announced the impending development of a competing model . <P> The Justice Department suit asks the court to order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IBM . It is not likely that Jus tice has any intention of breaking up the company . Probably , the trustbusters will use the threat as a bargaining point in working out a consent decree at the end of a case that is likely to drag on for years . Justice mainly hopes to restrain IBM 's zeal a bit so that more competition can flourish . IBM called the charges " unwarranted " and promised to " defend itself forcefully . " As evidence of the " open and strongly competitive nature of the computer business , " it cited the fact that more than 60 systems manufacturers and some 4,000 companies dealing in related parts have been attracted to an industry that was " virtually non-existent 20 years ago . " Nevertheless , IBM Chairman Thomas Watson Jr . now has to ponder hard before moving to expand his firm 's three-quarters hold on the market .
