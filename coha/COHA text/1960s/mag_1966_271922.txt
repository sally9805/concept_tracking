On a winter morning in 1959 , the body of Airline Clerk Mary Meslener , 23 , was found on a canal bank three miles from Miami International Airport . She had been shot once in the head . More than two months after the murder , Airman Joseph Shea , 20 , waved a bloody shirt at his sergeant in West Palm Beach and vaguely insisted that he had done " something bad . " Because Shea had been trying to fake a medical discharge , the sergeant was skeptical ; because the Meslener murder was still unsolved , though , Shea became a potential suspect . <P> After questioning Shea , Miami Detective Philip Thibedeau could find no connection between him and the murder . Even so , Detective Patrick Gallagher soon obtained the airman 's oral confession . <P> After Lie Detector Expert Warren D. Holmes said that his tests indicated Shea was innocent , the airman made another confession and this time signed it . Though Crime Lab Supervisor Edward D. Whittaker testified that Shea 's shirt was splattered with his own B-type blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O-type , the confession persuaded a jury to find Shea guilty of first-degree murder and to recommend mercy . <P> Self-Accused . Now , six years later , a second jury has voted for acquittal-all because Detective Thibedeau , Polygrapher Holmes and Miami Herald Reporter Gene Miller spent their spare time tracking down evidence that cast deep doubt on his confession . For one thing , Roman Catholic Shea had apparently undergone agonies of guilt after fathering an illegitimate child in the Philippines : " I did n't want to live , " he said . Even more important , Detective Gallagher admitted in nine hours on the stand at the second trial that he : <P> Told Shea that Mary Meslener 's blood was " all over " his shirt . <P> Told Shea that his fingerprints were found on her car , though he knew at the time that " his prints did n't match those in the car . " <P> " Probably " told Shea that he had flunked two lie-detector tests . <P> Kept a lawyer away from Shea on the day he signed his confession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Meslener 's husband . <P> Self-Wounded . In addition to this recital , the Air Force logbook at West Palm Beach suggested that Shea was on duty 65 miles away until at least one hour before Mary Meslener left the airport-hardly time enough , as claimed in his confession , for Shea to hitchhike to Miami , visit several downtown bars , ride a bus to the airport , try to steal a car , get caught in the act by Mary Meslener and then murder her . Not only was Shea later unable to point out the parking lot where the original assault took place , but a palm print found in the murder car belonged to neither Shea nor the victim nor her husband . At Shea 's first trial , the state did not disclose this fact-or the discovery of the victim 's wallet in a military installation with which Shea had no connection . Moreover , Shea later claimed in prison that he had actually cut himself and bloodied his own shirt in the hope of qualifying for a medical discharge .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
