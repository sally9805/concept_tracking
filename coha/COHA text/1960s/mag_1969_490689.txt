THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment ON Tuesday , March 4th , in the Kresge Auditorium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , a group of scientists assembled , with students and others , to discuss the uses of scientific knowledge . There is nothing we might print in these columns that could he more urgent than the extemporaneous speech , made be-fore that gathering by George Wald , professor of biology at Harvard and Nobel Prize winner , under the title " A Generation in Search of a Future . " We therefore quote from it here at length : " All of you know that in the last couple of years there has been student unrest , breaking at times into violence , in many parts of the world : in England , Germany , Italy , Spain , Mexico , japan , and , needless to say , many parts of this country . There has been a great deal of discussion as to what it all means . Perfectly clearly , it means something different in Mexico from what it does in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does in Tokyo , and something different in Tokyo from what it does in this country . Yet , unless we are to assume that students have gone crazy all over the world , or that they have just decided that it 's the thing to do , it must have some common meaning . " I do n't need to go so far afield to look For that meaning . I am a teacher , and at Harvard I have a class of about three hundred and fifty students  --  men and women  --  most of them freshmen and sophomores . Over these past few years , I have felt increasing ! ) that something is terribly wrong  --  and this year ever so much more than last . Something has gone sour , in teaching and in learning . It 's almost as though there were a widespread feeling that education has become irrelevant . " A lecture is much more of a dialogue than many of you probably . realize . As you lecture , you keep watching the faces , and information keeps coming hack to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year , that I was missing much of what was coming hack . I tried asking the students , but they did n't or could n't help me vet. ) much . " But I think I know what 's the matter . I think that this whole generation of students is beset with a profound uneasiness , and I do n't think that they have yet quite defined its source . I think I understand the reasons for their uneasiness even better than they do . What is more , I share their uneasiness . " What 's bothering those students ? Some of them tell you it 's the Vietnam war . I think the Vietnam war is the most shameful episode in the whole of American history . The concept of war crimes is an American invention . We 've committed many war . crimes in Vietnam  --  hut tell you I 'll something interesting about that . We were committing war crimes in World War II , before the Nuremberg trials were held and the principle of war crimes was stated . The saturation bombing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was a war crime . If we had lost the war , it might have been oar leaders who had to answer fur such actions . I 've gone and through all that history lately , amI I find that there 's a gimmick in it . It is n't written out , but I think we established it by precedent . That gimmick is that if one can allege that one is repelling or retaliating for an aggression , after that everything goes . " And , 3 ou see , we are living in a world in which all wars are wars of defense . All War Departments are now Defense Departments . This is all part of the douhletalk of our time . The aggressor is always on the other side . I suppose this is why our ex-Secretary of State Dean Rusk went to such pains to insist , as he still insists , that in Vietnam we are repelling an aggression . And if that 's what we are doing  --  so runs the doctrine  --  everything goes . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will have to he defined as categories of acts , regardless of alleged provocation . But that is n't so now . " I think we 've lost that war , as a lot of other people think , too . The Vietnamese have a secret weapon . It 's their willingness to die heyond our willingness to kill . In effect , they 've been saying , You can kill us , but you 'll have to kill a lot of us ; you may have to kill all of es . And , thank heaven , we are not yet reads to do that . " Yet we have come a long way toward it  --  far enough to sicken mans Americans , far enough to sicken even our fighting men . Far enough so that our national ss mhols have gone soul . How many of you can sing about ' the rockets ' red glare , the bombs bursting in air ' without thinking , Those are 0112- boirths and our rockets , bursting over South Vietnamese villages ? When those words were written , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we arc supporting open or thinly disguised military dictatorships all over the world , helping them to control and repress peoples struggling for their freedom . " But that Vietnam war , shameful and terrible as it is , seems to me only an immediate incident in a much larger and more stubborn situation . " Part of my trouble with students is that almost all the students I teach were horn after World War II . just after World War II , a series of new and abnormal procedures Came . into American life . We regarded them at the time as temporary aberrations . ' Vr thought we would get hack to normal American life someday . " But those procedures have stayed with us now for more than twenty years , and those students of mine have never known anything else . They think those things are normal . They think that we 've always had a Pentagon , that we have always had a big Army , and that we have always had a draft . But those are all new things in American life , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . " How many of you realize that just before World War II the entire American Army , including the Air Corps , numbered a hundred and thirty-nine thousand men ? Then World War II started , but we were n't yet in it , and , seeing that there was great trouble in the world , we doubled this Army to two hundred and sixty-eight thousand men . Then , m World War II , it got to he eight million . And then World War II came to an end and we prepared to go hack to a peacetime Army , somewhat as the American Army had always been before . And , indeed , in 1950 ? you think about 1950 , our international commitments , the Cold War , the Truman Doctrine , and all the rest of it  --  in 1950 , we got down to six hundred thousand men . " Now we have three and a half million men under arms : about six hundred thousand in Vietnam , about three hundred thousand more in ' support areas ' elsewhere in the Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there are a lot at home . Some months ago , we were told that three hundred thousand National Guardsmen and twin hundred thousand reservists  --  so half a million men  --  had been specially trained for riot duty in the cities . " I say the Vietnam war is just an immediate incident hecause as long as we keep that big an Army , it will always find things to dn . If the Vietnam war stopped tomorrow , the chances are that with that big a military establishment we would he in another such adventure , abroad or at home , before mi knew it . " The thing to do about the draft is not to reform it but tin get rid of it . " A peacetime draft is the most un-American thing I know . All the time was growing up , I was told about oppressive Central European countries and Russia , where young men were forced into the Army , and I was told what they did about it . They chopped off a finger , or shot off couple of toes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they came 0.1 this country . And we understood that , and sympathized , and were glad to welcome them . " Now , by present estimates , from four to six thousand Americans of draft age have left this country for Canada , two or three thousand more have gone to Europe , and it looks as though many more were preparing to emigrate . " A hill to stop the draft was recently introduced in the Senate ( S. 503 ) , sponsored by a group of senators that runs the gamut from McGovern and Hatfield to Barr ) Goldwater . I hope it goes through . But I think that when we get rid if the draft we must also drastically cut hack the size of the armed forces . " Yet there is something ever so much bigger and more important than the draft . That bigger thing , of course , is the militarization of our country . Ex-President Eisenhower , in his farewell address , warned us of what he called the tnilitary-industrial complex . I am sad to say that we must begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What happened under the plea of the Cold War was not alone that we built up the first big peacetime Army in our history but that we institutionalized it . We built , I suppose , the biggest government building in our history to run it , and we institutionalized it . " I do n't think we can live with the present military establishment , and its eight ) -billion-dollar-a-year budget , and keep America anything like the America we have known in the past . It is corrupting the life of the whole country . It is buying up everything in sight : industries , hanks , investnrs , scientists  --  and lately it seems also to have bought up the labor 0 ions . " The Defense Department is always broke , but some of the things it does with that eighty billion tinllars a year would make Buck Rogers envious . For example , the Rocky Mountain Arsenal , on the outskirts of Denver , was manufacturing a deadly nerve poison on such a scale that there was a problem of waste disposal . Nothing daunted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denver , into which they have injected so much poisoned water that , beginning a couple of years ago , Denver has experienced a series of earth tremors of increasing severity . Now there is grave fear of a major earthquake . An interesting debate is in progress as to whether Denver will he safer if that lake of poisoned water is tennived or is left in place . " Perhaps you hay , read also of those six thousand sheep that suddenly died in Skull Valley , Utah , killed by another nerve poison a strange and , I be-lieve , still unexplained accident , since the nearest testing seems to have been thirty miles away . " As for Vietnam , the expenditure of firepower there has been frightening . Some of you may still remember Khe Sanh , a hamlet just south of the Demilitarized Zone , where a force of United States Marines was beleaguered for a time . During that period , we dropped on the perimeter of Khe Sanh more explosives than fell on Japan throughout World War II , and more than fell cm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " One of the officers there was quoted as having said afterward , ' It looks like the world caught smallpox and died . ' " The only point of government is to safeguard and foster life . Our government has become preoccupied with death , with the business of killing and being killed . So-called defense now absorbs sixty per cent of the national budget , and about twelve per cent of the Gross National Product . " A lively debate is beginning again on whether or not we should deploy antiballistic missiles , the ABM . I do n't have to talk about them  --  everyone else here is doing that . But I should like to mention a curious circumstance . In September , 1967 , or ahout a year and A half ago , we had a meeting of M.I.T. and Harvard people , including experts on these matters , to talk about whether anything could he done to block the Sentinel system  --  the deployment of ABMs . Everyone present thought them undesirable , but a few of the most knowledgeable persons took what seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dead issluef It has been decided , the funds have been appropriated . Let 's go on from there . ' " Well , fortunately , it 's not a dead issue . " An ABM is a nuclear weapon . It takes a nuclear weapon to stop a nuclear weapon . And our concern must be with the whole issue of nuclear weapons . " There is an entire semantics ready to deal with the sort of thing I am about to say . It involves such phrases as ' Those arc the facts of life . ' No these arc the facts of death . I do n't accept them , and I advise you not tin accept them . V'e are under repeated pressure to accept things that are presented to us as settled -- decisions that have been made . Always there is the thought : Let 's go on from there . But this time we do n't see how to go on . We will have to stick with these issues . " We are told that the United States and Russia , between them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of fifteen tons of TNT for every man , woman , and child on earth . And now it is suggested that we must make more . All very regrettable , of course , but ' those are the facts of life . ' We really would like to disarm , but our new Secretary of Defense has made the ingenious proposal that now is the time to greatly increase our nuclear armaments , so that we can disarm from a position of strength . " I think all of you know there is no adequate defense against massive nuclear attack . It is both easier and cheaper to circumvent any known nuclear-defense system than to provide it . It 's all pretty crazy . At the very moment we talk of deploying ABMs , we are also building the MIRV , the weapon to circumvent ABMs . " As far as I know , the most conservative estimates of the number of Americans who would he killed in a major nuclear attack , with everything working as well as can he hoped and all foreseeable precautions taken , run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gruesome statistics , and this seems at first to he only another gruesome statistic . You think , Bane  --  and next morning , if you 're still there , you read in the newspapers that fifty million people were killed . " But that is n't the way it happens . When we killed close to two hundred thousand people with those first , little , old-fashioned uranium bombs that we dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki , about the same number of persons were maimed , blinded , burned , poisoned , and otherwise doomed . A lot of them took a long time to die . " That 's the way it would he . Not a hang and a certain number of corpses to bury but a nation filled with millions of helpless , maimed , tortured , and doomed persons , and the survivors huddled with their families in shelters , with guns ready to fight off their neighbors trying to get some uncontaminated fond and water . " A few months ago , Senator Richard Russell , of Georgia , ended a speech in the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again with another Adam and Eve , I want them to he Americans ; and I want them on this continent and not in Europe . ' That was a United States senator making a patriotic speech . Well , here is a Nobel laureate who thinks that those words are criminally insane . " How real is the threat of full-scale nuclear war ? I have my own very inexpert idea , hut , realizing how little I know , and fearful that I may be a little paranoid on this subject , I take every opportunity to ask reputed experts . I asked that question of a distinguished professor of government at Harvard about a month ago . I asked him what sort of odds he would la ) on the possibility of full-scale nuclear war within the foreseeable future . ' Oh , ' he said comfortably , ' I think I can give you a pretty good answer to that question . I estimate the probability of full-scale nuclear war , provided that the situation remains about as it is now , at two per cent per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that two per cent per year means that the chance of having that full-scale nuclear war by 1990 is about one in three , and by 2000 it is about fifty-fifty . " I think I know what is bothering the students . I think that what we are up against is a generation that is by no means sure that it has a future . " I am growing old , and my future , so to speak , is already behind me . But there are those students of mine , who are in my mind always ; and there are my children , the youngest of them now seven and nine , whose future is infinitely more precious to me than my own . So it is n't just their generation ; it 's mine , too . We 're all in it together . " Are we to have a chance to live ? We do n't ask for prosperity , or security . Only for a reasonable chance to live , to work out our destiny in peace and decency . Not n : go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is n't only nuclear war . Another overwhelming threat is in the population explosion . That has not yet even begun to come under control . There is every indication that the world population will double before the year 2000 , and there is a widespread expectation of famine on an unprecedented scale in many parts of the world . The experts tend to differ only in their estimates of when those famines will begin . Some think by 1980 ; others think they can he staved off until 1990 ; very few expect that they will not occur by the year 2000 . " That is the problem . Unless we can be surer than we now are that this generation has a future , nothing else matters . It 's not good enough to give it tender , loving care , to supply it with breakfast foods , to buy it expensive educations . Those things do n't mean anything unless this generation has a future . And we 're not sure that it does . " I do n't think that there are problems of youth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about are grown-up problems . " Perhaps you will think me altogether absurd , or ' academic , ' or hopelessly innocent  --  that is , until you think of the alternatives  --  if I say , as I do to you now : Vie have to get rid of those nuclear weapons . There is nothing worth having that can be obtained by nuclear war  --  nothing material or ideological no tradition that it can de-fend . It is utterly self-defeating . Those atomic bombs represent an unusable weapon . The only use for an atomic bomb is to keep somebody else from using one . It can give us no protection  --  only the doubtful satisfaction of retaliation . Nuclear weapons offer us nothing but a balance of terror , and a balance of terror is still terror . " We have to get rid of those atomic weapons , here and everywhere . We can not live with them . " I think we 've reached a point of great decision , not just for our nation , not only for all humanity , but for life upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of pride that I hope they will share , that the carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen that make up ninety-nine per cent of our living substance were cooked in the deep interiors of earlier generations of dying stars . Gathered up from the ends of the universe , over billions of years , eventually they came to form , in part , the substance of our sun , its planets , and ourselves . Three billion years ago , life arose upon the earth . It is the only life in the solar system . " About two million years ago , man appeared . He has become the dominant species on the earth . All other living things , animal and plant , live by his sufferance . He is the custodian of life on earth , and in the solar system . It 's a big responsibility . " The thought that we 're in competition with Russians or with Chinese is all a mistake , and trivial . kVe are one species , with a world to win . There 's life all over this universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earth , and in the whole universe we are the only men . " Our business is with life , not death . Our challenge is to give what account we can of what becomes of life in the solar system , this corner of the universe that is our home ; and , most of all , what becomes of men all men , of all nations , colors , and creeds . This has become one world , a world for all men . It is only such a world that can now offer us life , and the chance to go on . " E Heating and lighting . A and B are kerosene lamps .
