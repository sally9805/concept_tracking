THE TRAITOR ( 304 pp. ) - Andr Gorz - Simon &; Schuster ( $4.50 ) . <P> To the many hazards of autobiography . <P> Andr Gorz , French by adoption but a birthright existentialist , has added something new . Austrian-born Author Gorz is not quite sure that he exists . He thus commits himself to a gaseous and perhaps nonexistent subject matter . Nonetheless , this enterprise has set the eyeballs of Existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre rolling in a fine frenzy , resulting in 36 pages of introduction , " an honor accorded few books , " as the publishers reverently announce . Sample honor : " This hoarse , muffled voice , this breaking voice will live in your ears . " Readers who like philosophical teasers will be fascinated by this dubious puzzler that is all clues and no solution . Essentially , it is not an autobiography - although such facts as may be found in it correspond to Gorz 's own personnel file - for the author is seeking not to establish , but to disclaim , destroy and discard his nature . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which a thousand Jobs , from Silone to Koestler , have pleaded their hardship cases before history 's unsentimental court - the D.P. 's story . Gorz is not just an other displaced person , but a displaced personality . Feeling rejected by history , he responds with a gesture of total repudiation . Says Gorz of himself : " Not to be here ; to be only a transparent , ineffable and therefore invulnerable presence . . . this is how he began to be . " Indeed , Gorz stands at such a distance from himself that for most of the book he refers to himself as " he , " to the admiration of Sartre , who is reminded of Rimbaud 's declaration " Je suis unautre I am someone else <P> " Intellectual B.O. In Austria before World War II , Gorz was a Catholic among Jews and a Jew among Catholics . His father , a shuffling businessman , had changed his name on conversion to Christianity . After Anschluss , young Gorz was a " half-caste of the first class . " In all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bleaker childhood . Mother was hateful , wanted him a girl ; Father was despicable and despised ; at school , his playmates beat young Gorz up , and of course he was a coward . The only things that seem to be lacking in his lifelong dossier of difference from others is that Gorz is neither homosexual nor colored.
