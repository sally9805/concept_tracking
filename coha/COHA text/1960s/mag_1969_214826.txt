BULLET PARK by John Cheever. 241 pages . Knopf. $5.95 . <P> <P> After the final melodramatic act of John Cheever 's new novel-in which a boy barely escapes being turned into a gasoline-soaked torch on the altar of an Episcopal church-the reader is assured that everything is going to be " as wonderful , wonderful , wonderful , wonderful as it had been . " Lest it be thought that this is an attempt to fill the current American prescription for a tragedy with a pain-killing happy ending , it should be made clear that Cheever means by his four " wonderfuls " very much the same bitter things conveyed in the famous five " nothings " of King Lear . There are no dizzy precipices edging the smug suburban surface of Bullet Park . There is , however , the " portable abyss " of the commuter 's 7:46 a.m. to Grand Central . <P> John Cheever 's title , in the most obvious way , is intended to suggest that it is possible to die just as dead and be as swiftly damned among movers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cockroach-infested retreats of the materially disadvantaged . <P> Insistence on that point is not new for Cheever . He has always been something of a Christian soldier in mufti , a man more kin to John Bunyan than to John Updike . Cheever 's formula for circumventing disorder and the Devil has never strayed far from the New England legacy of his first full-length character , old Leander Wapshot . " Bathe in cold water every morning , " Leander counseled his sons . " Relish the love of a gentle woman . Trust in the Lord . " Yet literary means , like wars and prices , tend to escalate . In Bullet Park , trying to cope with up-to-date exurban alarums and filial excursions-including creeping despair and the generation gap - has widened farther than ever the consistent gap between Cheever 's surface realism and the bizarre events and distorted perspectives of the moral allegories he pursues . <P> Befuddled Blessedness . Structurally the book seems simple : a narrative about the struggle between suburban neighbors unabashedly named Hammer and Nailles . The latter , Eliot Nailles , is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A churchgoer , country clubman , volunteer fireman and commuter , Nailles , in most modern literary hands , might emerge as a figure of fun . Cheever loves him , however , and sees in his dominant character istics-passionate monogamy , joy in small things , and especially in his inarticulate love for his teen-age son Tony-a kind of befuddled blessedness . It is a quality not unlike Billy Budd 's , all the more vulnerable because it is unaware of evil . " Nailles thought of pain and suffering , " Cheever writes , " as a principality lying somewhere beyond the legitimate borders of western Europe . "
