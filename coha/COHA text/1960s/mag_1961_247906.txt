Cold War in Laos <P> Sir : <P> As one of the only two State Department vice consuls in Laos reporting on that unhappy land before and during the 1954 Geneva solution , I feel qualified to say that the cover story on Laos was superbly done . <P> This little land and people need our understanding assistance . They are charming people-innocent , kind and loving . It is a tragedy that they have been thrust into the no man 's land of the cold war . <P> ROGER S. DARLING <P> Falls Church , Va . <P> Sir : <P> I fear that neutralism is not the answer to Laos ' political problems . After Communist Chinese inroads on neutralist India 's territory , and the respect shown for the Korean cease-fire agreement , any trust in Chinese and Russian promises of non-interference in Laos can be likened to Neville Chamberlain 's trust in Hitler at Munich . <P> WILLIAM F. STRATHMAN <P> Lafayette , Ind . <P> Sir : <P> You state that Cambodia follows a policy of " capricious neutralism . " We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derogatory adjectives which , in addition to being inaccurate , seem to be calculated to needle and annoy . <P> We find ourselves once more obliged to take issue with your misjudgment of our foreign policy , which we believe to be a genuine and sincere neutrality . <P> NONG KlMNY <P> Ambassador of Cambodia <P> Washington , D.C. <P> School Aid Battle <P> Sir : <P> Compliments to TIME on an objective , de-emotionalized report on the controversy over federal aid to private schools . I have made it required reading in my classes . <P> FRANCESCO CORDASCO <P> Department of History of Education <P> Seton Hall University <P> South Orange , NJ . <P> Sir : <P> The American Catholic throughout the history of the nation has proved his loyalty and devotion to the American way of life . He has borne cheerfully the burden of double taxation in order to educate his children according to the just dictates of his conscience . It is indeed unfortunate in these times of seeming progress that the conscientious American Catholic is to be systematically made the victim of the universal evils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important constitutional issue today is the protection of the rights and dignity of the individual citizen , and not the belaboring of the almost nonexistent , specious church-state question . <P> THOMAS J. GREGORY <P> The Bronx , N.Y . <P> Sir : <P> Re your article " Battle Over Schools " : When pressure from a certain religious denomination can strike such terror in the minds and hearts of our governmental leaders that they feel compelled to alter their legislation as this sect so desires , can we , as Americans , truly say that in this country the church and state are separate ? <P> ROBERT E. POTTS <P> Essex Fells , N J. <P> Sir : <P> Officials who spend the taxpayers ' money are answerable to Americans who elected them . If federal funds are allocated to Catholic parochial schools , who will direct them how to spend it ? We , the taxpayers ? Abraham Ribicoff ? <P> LARRY STEINBERG <P> New York City <P> The Corvette <P> Sir :                @ @ @ @ @
