txt President Johnson , in his first news conference in nearly a month , reasserted United States commitments to defend Southeast Asia today but ' softened the tone of recent ' warnings of a possible expansion of the war in Vietnam . In response to reporters ' questions , the President said he knew of no plans for the United States to carry the anti-Communist struggle in South Vietnam to the north , Question 12 , Page 25 . The future of Southeast Asia " as a whole " is at stake in Laos and Vietnam , he said , adding , that the United States intended ' to stand by its " solemn commitments to help defend this area against Communist encroachments . " ! Opening statement . The White House announced that Under Secretary of State ' George W. Ball would leave Thursday for Europe , where he will confer with President de Gaulle and with members of the British Government , The stated purpose of the trip is to attend a United Nations trade and aid conference in Geneva , but qualified sources said Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western moves in Southeast Asia . So far Paris has been work- ing at cross-purposes with London and Washington . The French are advocating neutralization in Southeast Asia and an international conference on Laos . The United States , supported by Britain , has opposed such measures . Although the President talked firmly about Southeast Asia , his comments were apparently designed to temper some of the tough talk that has prevailed here since pro - communist forces in Laos opened new attacks on the neutralists May 16 , The current lull in the fighting has somewhat diminished the sense of crisis . Less than two weeks ago Secretary of State Dean Rusk warned that the war in South Vietnam could be expanded if the Communists " persist in their course of aggression . " Mr. Johnson emphasized the point that the United States interest was in helping to preserve peace , He shied ? away from discussing any specific measures that might be taken to hold back Communist pressures . His principal diplomatic and military advisers are discussing the problem in Honolulu . Secretary Rush , Secretary of Defense Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strategy session tomorrow to report to the President . Mr , Johnson 's denial of knowledge of plans for attacking North Vietnam brought a charge from Representative Melvin R. Laird , Republican of Wisconsin , that the President had " deliberately mislead the American people . " " This is just simply not the case , " Mr. Laird said in a speech to the House of Representatives . " We have plans and we should not tell the enemy that we have no plans . " He said that as chairman of the 1964 Republican National Convention 's Platform Committee , he had been informed by Mr. Rusk of contingency plans for attacks on North Vietnam . He emphasized the point that the plans had simply been drafted and that no decision had been taken to implement them . Mr. Laird first mentioned the planning on North Vietnam in a radio interview last weekend . The President was asked about Mr. Laird 's comments , Initially Mr. Johnson sought to dodge the issue by noting that the Wisconsin Republican was not an Administration spokesman . Pressed further about Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the President replied : " I know of no plans that have been made to that effect . " Much of the controversy appeared to arise from semantic differences . Administration officials made no attempt to deny Mr. Laird 's comments about contingency plans that are part of a wide-ranging effort to be prepared for any eventuality . They explained that the President was trying to say that no such plans had reached his desk for decision . The President also appeared to be trying to get the Republican party to share with his Administration the responsibility for deep American involvement in South Vietnam . Mr. Johnson began his news conference with a long statement on the situation in Southeast Asia , including in it the text of a 1954 letter from former President Dwight D. Eisenhower to the late President Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam . The letter affirmed support for the South Vietnamese against Communist pressures . " Now , that was a good letter then and it is a good letter now , and we feel the same way , Mir . Johnson said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; bound by solemn commitments to help defend this area against Communist encroachment . We will keep this commitment . " Blaming the Communists for spreading terror , trying to establish dictatorial control and violating international agreements , Mr. Johnson declared that the intentions of the United States were peaceful . " We have one single central , purpose in all that we do in Southeast Asia , and that is to help build a stable peace , " he . said . He added that the strategy talks in Honolulu covered " plans for progress as well as programs against terror . " The President also upheld the equipment being provided American fighting men in South Vietnam . Critics have charged that obsolete equipment is causing casualties . Backs Replying to questions , he said he had looked into news articles reporting that mechanical and structural failures were to blame for some casualties . While acknowledging that " you will find flaws from time to time " in even the best equip , : ment , the President supported Secretary 's recent declaration that the best equipment was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ j " From time to time , remedies will have to be found and sub , stitutions made , " he said , " hut , I believe that we are furnishing good equipment , that it is being , handled well , and I do n't share , any concern about the quality of it or the quality of the men , handling it .

" It will be necessary to mender both military and economic assistance to that country for some time , maintaining a stalemate with the rebels for the , time being if that 's the best we , ! can do , " the Vermont RepubliH can said .
