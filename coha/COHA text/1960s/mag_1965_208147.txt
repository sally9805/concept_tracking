FOREIGN RELATIONS <P> Georgia 's Senator Richard Russell , chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , has been a generally strong supporter of global U.S. foreign policy from the Marshall Plan onward . Yet last week he grumbled : " We made a terrible mistake getting involved in Viet Nam . I do n't know just how we can get out now , but the time is about at hand when we must re-evaluate our position . " He wants to re-evaluate other areas too . " It would be nothing less than tragedy for us to go and get involved in the Congo as we are in Viet Nam , " he said . <P> Nobody else was particularly eager to get deeply involved in the Congo either . Yet these words from Richard Russell marked a strange new mood about foreign policy-far from general , but significant . Only a short time ago the most enlightened men in both parties made it a cardinal principle that the U.S. must assume , if not downright seek out , global responsibility for freedom . Now many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is badly overextended , that it is not strong enough to assume responsibility all over the globe , and that it is time to pull back in Viet Nam and elsewhere . <P> Is it fair to call this mood a new form of isolationism ? Columnist Walter Lippmann , for one , does not shrink from the word : " If it is said that this is isolationism , I would say yes . It is isolationism if the study of our own vital interests and a realization of the limitations of our power is isolationism . It is isolationism as compared with the globalism which became fashionable after the Second World War . " <P> Globalism &; Scatteration . As Lippmann sees it , the vital interests of the U.S. are in Europe and the Americas , not in the " soft regions " of Asia and Africa , where the U.S. has been sucked into the power vacuum left behind by the colonial rulers . As a result , " we have scattered our assistance to such a degree that we help everybody a little and nobody enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created enough disappointment and frustration to generate a wave of anti-Americanism . . . Our security and well-being are not involved in Southeast Asia or in Korea and never have been . " <P> Similar views are not surprising from that Democratic loner , Oregon Senator Wayne Morse , or from Senators Mike Mansfield and Ernest Gruening , who have previously advocated various forms of withdrawal or neutralization in South east Asia . A tentative new recruit to this school of thought is Idaho 's Democratic Senator Frank Church , a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . His vague and heavily qualified views probably would not have been widely noticed had they not been plucked out of an interview he had granted three months ago to Ramparts , a small-circulation magazine ( 22,000 ) for Catholic laymen , and given frontpage display and editorial praise last week by the New York Times-which has long advocated " true neutrality " as a way out of the Viet Nam mess .
