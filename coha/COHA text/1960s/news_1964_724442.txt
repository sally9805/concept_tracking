txt Alex Quaison-Sackey of Ghana , President of the General Assembly , has stepped into the deadlocked United Nations financial negotiations with a plan of his own . United States officials viewed the plan as positive and one that could enable the stalled Assembly to get on with its business . In essence , the proposal appeals to all member states for 1 " adequate and substantial contributions , " or pledges , to be made to a voluntary fund . It asks the Secretary General , U Thant , to report by Jan. 15 on the contributions or pledges received to restore the United Nations to a " stable and solvent basis . " Charter Issue Avoided Mr. Quaison-Sackey 's plan contains no specific mention of the controversy over enforcement of Article 19 of the United Nations Charter , under which the Soviet-bloc countries would lose their Assembly votes for excessive arrears on assessments . The Soviet Union owes $52.6 million because of its refusal to help pay for the United Nations peace-keeping operations in the Congo and Middle East . It has attaciced them as unauthorized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big powers and to leaders of the Asian , African and Latin blocs . Delegation sources said that Mr. Quaison-Sackey had pursued the finance issue at a luncheon with Soviet and African representatives . These sources also said that the Assembly President was not optimistic about the reception given his proposals . Mr. Quaison-Sackey went to Riverdale to talk with the Secretary General on Mr. Thant 's U . N . Assembly President Offers New Plan to Ease Funds Crisis // first day home after , hospital treatment for an ulcer . He was Mr. Thant 's only official caller today . Secretary of State Dean Rusk flew to New York from Washington today and went into immediate consultation with Adlai E. Stevenson , the chief representative , and other members of the United States delegation . These talks were a prelude to a meeting tonight of Mr. Rusk and Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko of the Soviet Union . Mr. Gromyko was host at a diplomatic reception at the Soviet mission , 136 East 67th Street . Mr. Quaison-Sackey 's plan was reliably reported to have encountered opposition from members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was suggested as a resolution for approval by the Assembly . It would be much easier to present the ' plan as a " gentleman 's agreement , " they said . The Asian-African group has given its unanimous support to an alternative plan offered not as a resolution but as an agreement . This proposal also calls for voluntary contributions but differs from the QuaisonSackey formula on key points . It provides specifically that the parties agree not to raise the question of applying the punitive , vote-revoking measures of Article 19 . This earlier plan was drafted by a 12-member group headed by Abdul Rahman Pazhwak of Afghanistan . Its supporters circulated today their first formal statement outlining its points . Both plans call for a comprehensive review , as soon as possible , of all aspects of peacekeeping operations ? how such undertakings should be authorized , recruited , controlled and financed . Such a review would mean the establishment of a new United Nations committee or a widening of the authority of the 21-member working group that has been trying to solve the finance problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be sacrificing their " basic- positions . " Supporters of the Asian-African proposal said privately that they were opposed to trying to make formal the method of contribution for fear of creating another deadlock . Rather than call for " substantial contributions , " as in the Quaison-Sackey plan , they said there need be only an understanding that contributions would not be of a token nature . A key United States objection has been based on concern that the Soviet Union would not make a commitment as to how much it would pay and whether it would be sufficient to avert enforcement of Article 19 . The Charter provides that members whose arrears equal two years of assessments are subject to loss of vote . Moscow has relaxed its opposition to the extent of saying that it will give Mr. Thant ? and only Mr. Thant  --  a commitment on what it will contribute to a " rescue fund . " However , it was said to have attached the condition that the Assembly authorize any such fund .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
