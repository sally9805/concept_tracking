With a breakfast-time disquisition on " Stresses Within the Communist Bloc , " Washington 's WTTG TV last week began to broadcast a series of uncompromisingly erudite lectures on international affairs by professors of New York 's Columbia University. * Behind this brainstretching venture , which drew a rare rave from FCC Chairman Newton Minow , stood an unlikely figure : Investment Banker Armand Grover Erpf , 64 . In 26 years as a partner in Manhattan 's prestigious Carl M. Loeb . Rhoades &; Co .. elfinlike Armand Erpf has displayed an uncanny nose for investment opportunities that has led fellow financiers to label him " a professionals ' professional . ' ' But whenever possible . Erpf likes to combine commercial profit with intellectual advancement-and in his eminently successful pursuit of both goals he has made himself perhaps Wall Street 's closest approximation of Renaissance man . <P> The Urge to Educate . The Columbia television lectures are characteristic of Erpf 's operations . Seven years ago , one of his investment sorties resulted in the creation of a profitable TV and outdoor-advertising chain called Metromedia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network . Recently , when he heard that Metromedia had an empty half hour of broadcast time in the morning , ardent Columbia Alumnus ( ' 17 ) . Erpf grabbed up the free time and got the lecture series under way with the financial backing of Columbia Associates , an organization of Columbia College well-wishers that he heads . The purpose of the programs , says Erpf , is to permit " adult people in this time of trouble and tensions to have not only the solace of entertainment but the spur of education . " By no means inciden tally , the TV series also may well turn a profit for Columbia Associates . <P> It was at least partly Erpf 's urge to educate at a profit that led him to invest in the Crowell-Collier Publishing Co. after it dropped Collier 's Magazine in 1956 . In the five years since , Crowell-Collier has gone from losses to profits ( $4,000,000 last year ) , and currently Erpf and his investing partners are adding new companies to Collier 's at a two-a-year clip . Last week , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bren-tano bookstore chain , which , like all conventional booksellers , has been hard hit by department-store and discount-house competition . <P> The Brentano purchase , explains Erpf , " adds to the bookishness of the company " and fits in with his dream of " changing publishing into a modern corporate enterprise to bring education to the masses . " If his dream is realized , predicts Erpf , " we 'll have a renaissance here that will make the Italian Renaissance look like a pond next to the ocean-and Crowell-Collier could become more interesting to investors than U.S. Steel .
