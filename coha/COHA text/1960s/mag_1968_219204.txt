In their quest for delegates last week , Ronald Reagan at times sounded like Nelson Rockefeller and Rockefeller sounded like Richard Nixon-when he could make himself heard . Both Ronnie and Rocky berated Bobby for sounding like Barry , and Dick , counting his delegates , at first said hardly a word . <P> Right now , " the country may want a Neville Chamberlain , " a Reagan aide declared , but " sooner or later , Winston Churchill is going to be President . " To earn the comparison , Reagan expended sweat and toil . He took a four-day swing through Louisiana , Florida , North Carolina , Illinois and Ohio to raise $800,000 for the party . In the process , he damaged his non-candidate pose . He is only awaiting the national convention to move , Reagan conceded , picking a phrase from Rocky to explain that he will not actively compete until then in order to avoid " divisiveness " within the G.O.P. On more familiar ground , the Californian urged that " we kick the devil " out of the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R.F.K. ( " When he stands before a Chamber of Commerce , he sounds like Goldwater " ) , termed the New Left " unwashed members of the old right , " and called former Secretary of Defense McNamara an " inspired accountant " who had made " the missile gap a reality . " He aimed his sharpest rockets and gags at Lyndon Johnson . <P> Quitting the Case . " We are called a sick America , " said Reagan in Charlotte , N.C. , " and now the doctor tells us he no longer has a remedy , so he is quitting the case . Unable to cure the dollar , he has settled for passing the buck . " <P> As for Rocky , he decided to slug it out with Nixon , then delivered an economics speech that seemed a pale mirror image of Nixon 's words . Like Reagan , Rocky toured the South , even met the Californian in a brief confrontation . As usual , he carefully refrained from attacking Reagan but finally had to admit : " We do not share a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an R. &; R. ticket , and thus presumably pleasing both his own liberal followers and Reagan 's conservative ones . In Atlanta , Rocky ran into the most antagonistic audience he has seen since the 1964 Republican Convention . At Negro Spelman College , fostered and funded by Rockefellers , his speech was shredded by black hecklers who screeched , " Get your money out of South Africa ! " , " Get off the stage ! " , " Rocky is a racist ! " and " Rockefeller , go home ! " <P> Damning Democrats . Rocky nonetheless damned Democrats with a will . Kennedy , he said , went through Indiana and Nebraska as " a study in conspicuous conservatism . " Echoing another theme used by Nixon and other Republicans , the Governor pointed to the President 's " grave failures of leadership " as evidence that " we may have done more damage to the well-being of lower-income families through inflation than we have done good for them through all the so-called ' Great Society ' programs .
