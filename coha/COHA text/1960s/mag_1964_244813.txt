CHURCH &; STATE <P> Millions of U.S. Christians emotionally reject the Supreme Court 's successive decisions against prayer in schools ; in fact , as this month 's hymn-laden commencement ceremonies show , prayer is still very much in schools , regardless of the court . But church leaders , at first often prone to echo their congregations in opposing the court , have thought through the legal implications of attempting to overrule the court by constitutional amendment . They now overwhelmingly agree that the court has affirmed the essential meaning of the First Amendment : it protects all religions by establishing none . <P> On the Record . Almost every Protestant denomination-ranging from the Seventh-day Adventists to the Episcopal National Council-has gone on record endorsing the decisions . The National Council of Churches , representing 31 Protestant and Orthodox groups with more than 40 million members , approved the rulings last June .

A new survey of diocesan papers by the Catholic weekly Ave Maria revealed that 35 have gone on record opposing any congressional action to overturn the court decisions , while only eight favor it ; two years ago , a big majority of the same papers attacked the Supreme Court 's ruling on the New York State Board of Regents ' prayer . Meanwhile , the church leaders who oppose the court decisions are fewer , although they still include Billy Graham , Fundamentalist Radio Preacher Carl Mclntire , James Francis Cardinal Mclntyre of Los Angeles*and New York 's Auxiliary Bishop Fulton J. Sheen . <P> Doubtful Layman . Says the United Presbyterian Stated Clerk , Dr. Eugene Carson Blake : " My experience is uniformly that where there is careful study of the issues involved-in contrast to an initial and unconsidered emotional reaction-a substantial body of thoughtful church-member opinion sees the dangers inherent in the practice of devotions in the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been convinced of the court 's wisdom to the degree that clergymen are . The Rev. Shrum Burton , president of the Kansas City Council of Churches , explains that " some laymen have a vague feeling that we are losing all religion in public life and that something ought to be done , but they do n't know what . " At the recent Methodist General Conference , a resolution approving the prayer rulings was tabled by a vote of 341 to 339 . Many school districts have not yet complied with the court decisions , and there are plenty of public schools where the class day begins with a moment of silent meditation . <P>
