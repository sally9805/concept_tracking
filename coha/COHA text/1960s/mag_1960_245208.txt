With the rise of computer punch-card accounting and the decline of the clerk 's pen-entry ledger , company comptrollers have relaxed in a new atmosphere of mechanical morality . They have been confident that neither false entry nor ink eradicator could juggle the electronic accounts . But last week , Walston &; Co. , one of Wall Street 's largest brokerage firms , found that the computer is no more honest than the hand that feeds it . In eight years , Walston Vice President and Computer Specialist Frank B. Haderer , 50 , had stolen more than $260,000 from the electronic till , to become the first known big-league electronic embezzler . <P> Haderer helped install Walston 's IBM bookkeeping brain in 1950 , was made manager of the firm 's accounting department in 1957 because he knew more about the system than anyone else . Thus he had no trouble working out a simple way to wholesale larceny . He would go to the office after hours , make out punch cards to show a withdrawal from Walston 's big , fluctuating margin-interest account of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and punch out a deposit card . He would feed both cards into the machine . Since the computer kept books for both accounts , the auditors , for eight years , always found the company balances in perfect order . Even so , as a further precaution , Haderer never took more than $3,000 a month . As a check on the computer , the company required slips to match the punch cards for all deposits and withdrawals . Haderer slipped up on the slips . When Walston decided this year to audit its employees ' trading accounts independent of the general audit , it found cards in Haderer 's account that had no corresponding slips . An old-fashioned check of Haderer 's account uncovered the theft .
