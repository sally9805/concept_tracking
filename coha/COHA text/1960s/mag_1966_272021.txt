A LAST LAMP BURNING by Gwyn Griffin . 512 pages . Putnam. $6.95 . <P> Horace admired the bay . Virgil composed his Georgics and chose to be buried there . " I pardon all , " wrote Goethe , " who have lost their minds in Naples . " Readers will pardon British Novelist Gwyn Griffin ( A Significant Experience ) , who clearly lost his mind in Naples , and has here written a vast , violent novel that commandingly redeems his mania . <P> The story 's hero , 16-year-old Gennaro , is named for the city 's patron , San Gennaro , whose clotted , vial-encased blood , according to tradition , miraculously bubbles three times each year . Gennaro 's blood bubbles daily . The ebullient bastard child of a peasant mother and soldier father , he divides his zealous energies between caring for his impoverished , half-paralyzed Chinese grandfather and carrying on grandfather 's moribund undertaking establishment . <P> Handyman &; Thief . Gennaro is coffinmaker , wreathmaker , funeral-insurance salesman , handyman , business manager , and hearse driver . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Caught without a chauffeur 's license , he is slapped with a staggering fine and forbidden to drive . In debt for tobacco , rent , and worst of all , for coffin lumber , he limps through one hand-mangling day heaving shovelfuls of earth for a huge industrial corporation-and gets fired for incompetence . Employed in a sizzling restaurant kitchen , he is falsely accused of theft , gets fired again . <P> Only his undertaking business guarantees Gennaro a measure of self-respect . To save it , he turns into a thief and hijacks the contents of a warehouse , but is interrogated and tortured by the police . At last the business collapses ; dying old man and desperate young boy are turned out of their tumble-down tenement ; Gennaro is stripped of everything-except his roaring Neapolitan zest for life . <P> Plots &; Gloats . Author Griffin prints his story on a huge and variegated back cloth as complex as the ancient , untidy city that it portrays . It recounts history , both ancient and modern , and includes a decayed family of vulpine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disputed inheritance ; an oily industrialist who is patiently plotting to marry his fatuous daughter to the family 's weak-minded young heir ; a bumbling , gentle pedant who is complacently gloating over a fortune to which he does not yet have legal title , and as lusty a collection of blackmailers , murderers , police inspectors , political agitators and petty shopkeepers as are likely to appear outside the pages of Dickens . Like Dickens , Griffin leans rather too heavily on coincidence and the happy accident . He delights in detailing riots , violent death and upheavals of nature . But the trick effects chime neatly enough with the milieu . The result is thundering good Neapolitan drama .
