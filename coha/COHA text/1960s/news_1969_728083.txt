txt Meteorologists are asking countries around the world to keep an extra sharp eye on the weather throughout November . They hope in this way to assemble a comprehensive file of information on global weather which scientists can draw on in studying the working of the atmosphere . It 's an early step in GARP  --  the Global Atmospheric Research Program  --  in which participating meteorologists in many lands will coordinate their research over the next decade or so to gain deeper insight into world weather . The United Nations World Meteorological Organization and the International Council of Scientific Unions have set up a joint committee to plan GARP 's activities . In addition ? to weather data from the customary facilities , the committee hopes to get widespread reports from airline and ship crews and other unusual sources . If successful , the data gathering will be repeated next June . Physicists from around the world descend on Britain 's Culham Laboratory this week . They 'll discuss their progress in efforts to harness a " star " on earth  --  that is , to bring hydrogen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their goal of taming this fusion process which powers the sun and the hydrogen bomb is still an elusive one . But they continue to pursue it . And they now feel somewhat more optimistic than they did a few years ago . After enthusiastic forecasts of unlimited cheap electric power . ? forecasts made in the 1950 's  --  physicists had to back down . They had to face the fact that they literally did n't know what they were talking about . Not only would controlling hydrogen fusion be a formidable engineering undertaking , they did n't even know the basic physics of the process they were proposing to harness . As a result , controlled fusion began to drift into a backwater of research with reduced , or at least not strongly growing , support from disillusioned governments . But in the past couple of years , badly needed basic knowledge has been acquired . Some of the seemingly discouraging , factors have been resolved . 0 Aeronautical engineers are taking a new look at the aircraft wing . Classical wing sections have a curved top which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of sound  --  about 660 m.p.h. at 45,000 feet  --  this type of wing produces turbulent airflows , high drag , and poor stability , which make it difficult to fly straight and level . NASA research has produced a new airfoil , section  --  a wing with a flat top and a downward curving rear edge . Now North American Rockwell will build these wings on a modified Navy F8 jet fighter for testing at Edwards Air Force Base in California . If tests prove as successful as earlier wind-tunnel tryouts , a new breed of jet transports which cruise closer to the speed of sound may be on their way . How and why .. . Edgardo Contini , of Victor Gruen Associates , Los Angeles , has an idea for cleaning up pollution without cost to the taxpayer . Call air and water public assets , he says . Then anyone using and returning these assets dirty would have to pay a use fee . Fees collected would be used to subsidize producers and users of clean transportation vehicles and clean manufacturing processes ? who use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Contini , would provide incentives to develop cleaner motive power for autos and new manufacturing plants that do not foul the air and water but which might be expensive to build and operate . The stick-and-carrot method , he proposes , could be equally applied to insecticide users , passengers who smoke on planes , to ' mining operations , noisemakers of any kind ? in short , to all who alter the living environment to the detriment of others . Trends . . . The Dutch are still surfacing with new methods of holding back the sea . Their latest ingenious contraption is designed for quick use in damning up a flooded river , filling the gap in a breached dike , or even providing a temporary road to replace a destroyed bridge . It consists of a long rubber-nylon balloon attached to a concrete base which , is sunk onto the bed of the channel . When inflated , the sides of the  --  balloon are strong enough to dam up the water and its top is tough enough to stand traffic of light cars passing across the stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
