, for some reason , brought to mind other areas up and down the hemisphere where he had worked . It resembled them all , not in physicaldetail so much , but in something he sensed about it as his eyes , half-closed against the glare , roamed slowly over the patchwork hills to the sea and back again . Bournehills , this place he had never seen before , was suddenly the wind-scoured Peruvian Andes . The highlands of Guatemala . Chile . Bolivia , where he had once worked briefly among the tin miners . Honduras , which had proved so fatal . Southern Mexico . And the spent cotton lands of the Southern United States through which he had traveled many times as a young graduate studenton his way to do field work among the Indians in Chiapas . It was suddenly , to his mind , every place that had been wantonly used , its substance stripped away , and then abandoned . He was shaken and angered by the abandonment he sensed here , the abuse . And he felt this in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scatter rug on a slope . These fields only served to make more eloquent those places which were completely bald , where the depleted soil could no longer even sustain a little scrub or devil grass to disguise what had been done to it . Moreover , the place , these ragged hills crowded out of sight behind the high ridge , with the night hiding in their folds , even seemed , suddenly , to hold some personal meaning for him , his thoughts becoming complex , circular , wheels within a wheel as he stood there . Bournehills could have been a troubled region within himself to which he had unwittingly returned . Harriet had come over to stand next to him , and taking her arm he drew it through his and pressed it to his side . He was suddenly not only glad that he had given in on the question of her accompanying him on the trip and brought her along , but grateful as well for her calm , her cool touch , her lovely unruffled air , her certainty . He would need them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life again . " It 's quite some sight , " he said . " Yes , is n't it , " she said , a hand shading her eyes , which were slightly overcast . She was remembering her own disturbing impression of Bournehills from the plane yesterday , of its being some unexploredlandscape having nothing to do with a physical place as such . It looked even more so close-up . " Well , I guess you see you 've got your work cut out for you , " Merle said to Saul when they returned to the car . And oddly enough it was said quietly and without the usual edged smile.  | " Yes , " he said . " Looks like it . " The journey resumed . Merle , tensed over the steering wheel , her feet working the pedals , goaded the balky car up the steep lifts , down the sudden drops and , from time to time on the sudden sharp turns in the road , almost sent it colliding head-on ( or so it seemed to the others who were not used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an oncoming car or lorry . And all the while her voice kept pace with the spinning wheels and the noon sun traveling with them across the clear sweep of sky . One arm out the window , the silver bracelets singingtheir dissonant tune as she gestured , she called their attention to nearly every tree and stone in the disheartening landscape ; she announced the name of every hill they passed  --  Agincourt , Buckingham , Sussex , Lords , Drake  --  and she did so proudly , as if despite their near-ruin they were still somehow beautiful to her . " Pyre Hill , " she called out , and , bringing the car to a lurching halt , pointed across a wide , almost level field of canes flaunting their vivid green against the drabness to a hill perhaps a half mile off . It stood a blackened heap against the blue unclouded sky  --  an awesome sight , which held the eye even when you tried looking away . The hill appeared to have been almost totally destroyed by some recent fire . It might have only just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smoke drifting up from its charred sides , from its crest , blurring the air around it ; and to feel the heat from it against your cheek . The ground , you were certain , would still be hot underfoot . " It 's something to see , yes , " Merle said and her voice held the awe of someone viewing it for the first time . " Cuff ee Ned did it . He sent the whole thing up in flames during a little fracas we had down here sometimes back  --  back , " she repeated with a laugh , " in the days when the English were around here selling us for thirty pounds sterling . You would n't think it , but one of the biggest estate houses on the island used to be right on top that hill . People say it stood like a castle there . It belonged to Percy Bryam , the man who owned all of Bournehillsand everyone in it in the beginning . People used to have to get down on their knees when he passed . Bryam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put a match to it one night , " she said . " The entire hill up in flames now ! Castle and all . The very sky that night was on fire , they say "  --  and as she turned to the two in back , her eyes seemed to reflect the yellow edge to those flames . " And do you know that hill burned for five years . That 's right , " she insisted , at the skep/tical look Saul gave her . " For five long years , the books say  --  long after Cuffee Ned was dead and the revolt put down , the old hill continued to burn . " Then , reflective suddenly , speaking largely to herself : " The Pyre Hill Revolt ! There was never anything like it before or since . It 's the only bit of history we have worth mentioning on Bourne Island , even though I 'm always getting into trouble for saying so . Tell them about it for me , Allen "  --  and turning back to the wheel she sent the car plunging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanying them part of the way , Allen obediently told them the story of the revolt , sitting half-turned around in his seat and speaking in his scrupulously objectivemanner . According to the historical accounts , he said , the Pyre Hill Revolt had been the largest and most successful of the many rebellions that had taken place on the island . Under the leadership of Cuffee Ned , the slaves had not only , he told them , fired the hill and the surrounding cane fields and captured Percy Bryam , who had died shortly afterward yoked to the mill wheel at Cane Vale , where he had been tied and tortured , but they had also , with weapons raided from the arsenal atop Cleaver 's , driven back the government forces in a fierce battle there and sealed off the ridge  --  and then for over two years had lived as a nation apart , behind the high wall , independent , free . " And who again was the brains behind it , Allen ? " Merle said the moment he was finished . " Who the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marched old Bryam with a knife to his throat to the mill wheel , who sent the regiment high-tailing it back to town , who ran things in Bournehills for upward to three years ? None other than Cuffee Ned . The only real hero we 've ever had around here . Dear Cuffee , " she said quietly . Then : " I 'm afraid they got him in the end though . Yes . " She nodded , and the saints framing her saddened face shivered . " They took his head off and left it for all to see on a tall pike along Westminster Low Road . I 'll show you the place when we come to it . " You know , " she began again after a moment , " sometimes strangers to Bournehills wonder why we go on about Cuffee and Pyre Hill when all that happened donkeys ' years ago and should have long been done with and forgotten . But we 're an odd , half-mad people , I guess . We do n't ever forget anything , and yesterday comes like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , pulling away just in time as a lorry piled highp103with a load of freshly cut canes came barreling toward them around a curve . As they penetrated deeper into Bournehills , people began to appear , and Merle , her hand out the window , waved to them all  --  to those walking in what appeared slow motion along the road who took their time stepping out of the way of the onrushing car , to the occasionalblack indistinct figure of a woman or child standing outside one of the listing sun-bleached shacks scattered high on the slopes , and to the seemingly static forms of the men and women working in the fields under the overseeing eye of the sun . And everywhere they returnedher greeting . Pausing in the fields or along the road they would slowly raise their right arm like someone about to give evidence in court , the elbows at a sharp ninety-degree angle , the hand held stiff , the fingers straight . It was a strange , solemn greeting encompassingboth hail and farewell , time past and present . " Westminster Low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place where it was said the dead hero 's head had been exhibited on its tall pike . Mr. Douglin , the old man from yesterday , was there , wearing his patched denims and wide-brimmed straw hat ; and wieldinghis cutlass with the same loving care over what looked to be the same square of grass . As Merle hailed him he lifted the long knife in reply and the empty holes that served as his eyes glanced briefly their way from under the hat . A few yards farther on she again brought the car to a halt , this time in the midst of a work gang that was repairing the break in the road . " Oh , crime , " she said , and switched off the motor . Her hands slid to her lap , and a look of unimaginable despair swept her face and caused her body to slump as she gazed silently out at the men and women working there . As if unaware of the car parked in their midst they continued at their tasks , the women ferrying over large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby and then sowing them like seed over the prepared roadbed , the men spreading the mixture of stone dust and water used to cement the stones and then sealing down the road with flat , long - handled metal tampers . They went about the work at the same slow , almost dreamlike pace as the figures walking along the road or harvesting in the fields . Finally , after some minutes , they paused , and flicking away the perspiration from around their eyes , they turned to those in the car faces that were eloquent of their life upon the ravaged land , thatp104evoked for Saul a host of other faces he had known down the years  --  Indian , mestizo , black  --  which had held the same look . They were smiling faintly at Merle , the smiles soft against their blackness , beautifullycontrolled and knowing : they knew , it was clear , what was coming and were prepared . They said nothing , though , nor did they betray any curiosity about the others with her , but simply stood there under the sun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped , their bare feet rooted in the crushed stones and dust . " Could you tell me , please , just what it is you 're doing ? " Merle spoke at last , and her voice was so quiet she would not have been heard but for the silence . They did n't answer , but the smiles widened slightly , taking on a sly , conspiratorial edge . " Hyacinth Weekes , " she called in the quiet tone to a tall broadshoulderedwoman who stood with her filled bucket balanced easily on her head and her thick arms akimbo . " Yes , please , " the woman said , looking off . " What are you doing ? " " To tell you the truth , Mis-Merle , I could n't rightly say . " There was a mild stir of laughter like a shy wind moving close along the ground . Their eyes remained turned aside . " Desmond Vaughan , could you tell me what you 're doing ? " The gaunt man in a tattered shirt she addressed was one of the many Vaughans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , " the man said , not without a touch of impatience . " I 'm here trying to fix up this piece of old road so you 'll have sonicplaceto drive that big car of yours . " Amid the suppressed laughter she said in the ominously calm voice , " But Desmond , you know better than me this road 's not going to held . The next good rain and it 'll pick up and march off like all the othcn . You 've got to use asphalt or concrete or something so , not just a few chewed-up stones and spit . You know that . And you need a swain roller , not just that flatiron I see in your hand . And there should lac gabions at the sides to hold it in place . You know that . " " Is true , " he said , unruffled . This might have been a familiar exchange . " Mr. Innis ! " She had turned to call to the supervisor of tb4 crew , a drawn , aloof figure of uncertain age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked as if they had been handed down endlessly , and a worn cork hat to shield him from the sun . I%p105stood scowling against the glare to one side of the road , his body propped on a gnarled length of wood whittled from the slender branch of a tree which he was using as a shooting stick . He saluted , two black fingers touching his hat brim . " Where 's the asphalt ? Where 're the gabions ? " Her voice was rapidlylosing its false calm . He gave a chiding smile that said she should know better than to ask . " Well , Mis-Merle , we has n't gotten around yet to those newfangledthings here in Bournehills . " She began shouting then , her voice pitched to the high drumming of the afternoon heat and the strident hum of the insects hidden everywhere . " But what is it with us in this place , will you tell me ? " she cried . " Who put us so ? Is it that we ca n't change or we refuse to or what . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose stones exploding under its wheels and Mr. Innis and his crew , their hands calmly raised in the solemn stiff-arm greeting that was also farewell , disappeared in a moiling cloud of white dust . Brutally she gunned the Bentley up the steep road to Westminster 's summit , her swollen silence replacing the sound of her voice in the car and embarrassing the others so that they kept their gaze out the windows . As they climbed the twisting white marl road , the two crudely fashioned peaks which crowned the hill rose slowly before their eyes like stalagmites that would continue to grow until they had pierced the sky . The public buildings appeared , a blinding Mediterranean white in the noon glare , with the almshouse where she worked part time dominating the others . And suddenly , her mood changing , she laughed , and putting on her sunglasses , said , " What am I upsetting myself about anyway , will you tell me ? Mr. Innis and his old road will be here long after I 'm gone . Right , Allen ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave to the idiot , Seifert , who stood in his shapeless blue smock at the almshouse gate staring up into the sun , she sent the car plunging down the precipitous drop into the village of Spiretown , wedged between the broad foot of the hill and the sea beyond . The two in back could distinguish little of the village because of the rapid way she drove through it . They had a fleeting impression of a long , almost unbroken line of small , badly weathered wooden houses that were little better than shacks strung out along an arrow-straight road that appeared to be taking them head-on to the sea about a halfmileahead . Through the mournful gray dust churned up by the carp106which set the theme of the land here , they glimpsed occasional figures standing like statues carved out of basalt along the way , their hands raised in the silent , formal salute in answer to Merle 's wave . They spied a few brown , pot-bellied sheep grazing on what looked to be barren ground , a pig rooting absently in the open drain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there a few testy thin-necked fowl who refused to give way until the car was almost upon them , and then squawking indignantly , quickly goose-stepped out of its path . Toward the end of the village where the houses began to thin , the stretch of straight road suddenly broke off and veered right and they found themselves jolting over a narrow , unsurfaced track mined with stones and potholes . The landscape here had been stripped to its barestessentials . To their right reared a dark brooding spur of WestminsterHill which had curved around the village in a wide arc to slope gradually to the sea ; to their left stood a row of low sandhills thrown up by the wind and covered in sea grape and sedge ; beyond these lay the sea itself . It was the Atlantic this side of the island , a wild-eyed , marauding sea the color of slate , deep , full of dangerous currents , lined with row upon row of barrier reefs , and with a sound like that of the combined voices of the drowned raised in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more it is said , who in their enforced exile , their Diaspora , had gone down between this point and the homeland lying out of sight to the east . This sea mourned them . Aggrieved , outraged , unappeased , it hurled itself upon each of the reefs in turn and then upon the shingle beach , sending up the spume in an angry froth which the wind took and drove in like smoke over the land . Great boulders that had roared down from Westminster centuries ago stood scattered in the surf ; these , sculpted into fantastical shapes by the wind and water , might have been gravestones placed there to commemoratethose millions of the drowned . " Talk about a sea , yes , " Merle said softly and slowed the car to a crawl . " Have you ever seen anything like it ? " For a time they sat silently looking at it through a break in the sandhills . " I had forgotten how loud it is , " Allen said , and his hushed tone expressed the awe the others felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if it had been gathering force and power and speed across the entire breadth of the Middle Passage broke with the sound as of some massive depth charge on the must distant of the reefs . Saul , feeling the thunderous impact in the chain/bers of his heart , suddenly remembered how , during the war , he used to feel the earth shudder and recoil under him as the bombs struck . Beside him Harriet thought briefly for the first time in a long time , of the terrifying explosion that had rocked her sleep every night her last year with Andrew Westerman . At any moment the huge cloud , whose searing light made it seem the sun had crashed to earth , might mushroom up . She thought of the hand guiding Andrew 's on the lever . .. . " You do n't like it , " Merle said . She had been quietly watching her in the mirror . " Too noisy , eh ? Well , do n't mind , you 'll get used to the noise . " " Oh , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it . Moments later they were within sight of the guesthouse , and Allen , sitting forward suddenly in his seat , called out " Cassia House ! " in the same relieved and grateful way someone else might have said " home . " Perched some distance back from the beach on a rocky shelf of land that was the leveling out of Westminster 's tall spur , the guesthouse appeared to be several houses , some in limestone which the salt spray had blackened over the years , others in wood long weathered by the sun and damp , which had been haphazardly thrown together . The original house , a two-story rocklike structure with thick walls and deeply recessed windows to secure it against hurricanes , had been built as a vacation or bay house by the planter Duncan Vaughan , the common progenitor of Merle , Lyle Hutson 's wife , Enid , and the man Desmond Vaughan on the road gang . The various wings and other additions had been built by succeeding generations of Vaughans , includingMerle 's father . Rambling , run-down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much a part of the stark landscape of sea and sky as the sea and the dunes and the boulders strewn in the surf . It was one with the hill rising like a sixteenth-century cathedral behind it . " Do n't look at it too hard , it might collapse , " Merle said with a bitterlaugh as they swung into the large , bare front yard . " It 's a fright , I know . No plan to it at all . Just thrown together . But then what could you expect of the man who built it , some riffraff out of the gutters of Bristol or Liverpool , who slept on a chair every night of his life and tried to populate the entire island his one . What could you expect of the likes of him ? " And do n't look too hard at this old tree either , " she said , pullingp108up under a lone cassia tree . The tall tree , its limbs raised in mute supplication to the sky , looked as if it had been caught in the eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaf , stripped it of its bark , and left it stunned and twisted , near dying or dead . " It looks about gone , does n't it ? " she said . They had gotten out of the car and were standing  --  she with her shoes on now and the flared dress lifting around her legs in the wind  --  gazing up at the leafless tree . " But it 'll surprise you in a few months . When you 're just about ready to give up on it and chop it down for firewood , it suddenly breaks out in the biggest yellow blossoms you ever saw . Great clusters of them . And it happens practically overnight . You go to bed one night with the tree looking just as it is and wake the next morning to find it in full bloom . It 's something to behold . . . . " Then , with a sad shrug : " But the blossoms do n't last any time , I 'm afraid . In less than a week 's time they 're gone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affectionately  --  " is just her old half-dead self again . " " Not a thing 's changed , Merle , " Allen said gently , attempting perhaps to comfort her . She laughed , and the saints on her ears commenced their ceremonialdance . " Of course not ! " she cried . " How could it in this place ? Dear , dear Allen , " she said fondly , and slipped her arm through his , " Man , I 'm glad enough you 're hack . " Arm in arm with him , she led them across the stony yard to a flight of steps which had been hewn out of the rocky ledge upon which the house stood . The steps led down the south wall of the building to the beach , but perhaps halfway down , at what was the base of the house , they came to a long wide landing , and at the end of this , just where the steps began again , she turned off onto a veranda which ran the length of the several houses that made up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with age , but it was a lovely place  --  cool , set within the wind 's eye and , except in the early morning , out of direct reach of the sun . The ancient floorboards , the railing , the simple columns supporting the low roof , the deep-bottomed wooden lawn chairs lined up neatly in a row had all been bleached the color of driftwood by the salt spray and the sun . And it was an astonishinglyquiet place despite the noisy sea down the stretch of beach , a sanctuary for contemplation and repose . An invisible soundproof curtain , lifting and falling gently in the wind , might have been hung from its roof to mute the roar and sob of the breakers.  |p109The  young man Vere was there , perched on the railing at the far end waiting for Merle . He was absorbed in the dog-eared automotive manual he was never without , and for a moment did not hear them . Merle stopped short . " Wait , " she said , her eyes narrowing against the light , " is that Vere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you ? " she cried , her voice lifting above that of the sea , and he looked up . " Oh , Father ! " she exclaimed . " It is Vere ! He 's back . Leesy 's vision was right after all . . . . " The others with her forgotten , she hurried across the veranda , her heels rattling the worn floorboards and her voice rushing ahead to swirl around Vere , who had stood up at her approach . " But is it you in truth , Vere ? When did you get back ? How long have you been here ? My God , I scarcely recognized you , you 've gotten to be such a man . " She embraced him as she had Allen the night before , reaching up to take his face between her hands the way a mother would and restingher cheek against his for a moment . " I reached back safe , " he said , with the smile that was like a warm light issuing from his face . He offered the smile to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And how you been keeping all this time , Mis-Merle ? " he said . " How 's the old car ? " She laughed , gave the eloquent shrug . " What to say , Vere ? We 're both still here , only living ' cause we ai n't dead , as the old people say . " And holding him close to her side she turned and called to the others . " Come and meet Vere . He 's just back from your country on the labor scheme . " Saul reached them first , and holding out his hand to Vere as he came up said , " You 're the young man on the plane yesterday , are n't you ? " " Why , so he is , " Harriet said before Vere could answer , and in what was for her an impulsive gesture she took his other hand , drawn to him by the smile . " You had on a blue hat , as I recall . " Motioning over Allen who , his bulging briefcase in one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused shyly a little distance away , Merle made the introductions . And for the short time that they stood there with Vere 's easy smile like a source of light and strength they could all draw upon , they appeared to comprise a warm , close-knit circle . Their small gathering almost suggested a reunion : the coming together of the members of a family who had been scattered to the four corners of the earth and changed almost beyond recognitionp110by their differing circumstances , but the same still . They might have been searching for each other for a long time , seeking completion . And they had met finally ( although it was too late and could only last the moment ) here on this desolate coast , before this perpetually aggrievedsea which , even as they stood questioning Vere about the places he had worked in America , continued to grieve and rage over the ancient wrong it could neither forget nor forgive . They separated shortly afterward , Vere going to look at the Bentley , Allen hurrying away to inspect the kitchen garden Merle had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two in to see the house . She ushered them first into the drawing room , a large rectangular antechamber filled with heavy , old-style furniture , all of which had been blotched and whitened by the damp . Beyond this lay an equally large dining room that resembled a refectory . " Yellow , " she said pointing to the freshly painted walls . " I finished it only yesterday . " Passing quickly on , she led them down a long dim hall which took them into the heart of the house and then through a labyrinth of echoing stone passageways which gave the impression of leading ever inward . Many of the rooms they glimpsed along the way were obviously never used . The sunlight could barely penetrate the salt crust from the sea spray on the windows and the light and air in them seemed left over from another time . Pausing in the doorway of the kitchen , a vast , gloomy cavern of a room , she called to the housekeeper and cook . " Carrington ! " The tall , full-bosomed , maternal figure who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorway seemed less a person than a presence . She could have been one of the massed shadows in the kitchen that had broken off and assumed human form . ( And she was to remain a shadowy , indistinct figure to Harriet and Saul all duringtheir stay at the guesthouse . They were never to hear her speak or to be certain what she looked like , since she kept almost exclusively to the kitchen , and whenever there was something to be done in anotherpart of the house she would send her helpers , two young , strong-limbed girls from the village who served as chambermaids . ) " Oh , she 's a terror you see her there , " Merle said of her as soon as the introductions were over and she had led them away . " She never has a word for you and she 'll burn the food in a minute if you so much as look at her the wrong way . But there 's no getting rid of her . She goes with the house . You see , she was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only one to bury him , so I guess she has as much right to the place as I do . " Moving swiftly she pointed out a door at the end of a long passageway . " Those 're my digs , " she said . " And Allen can tell you that once I go in there and shut the door I 'm not to be disturbed . The house could be on fire  --  and sometimes I wish it would burn down so I could get the insurance money and go on back to England  --  do n't call me . Call Carrington . She 's the one who really runs the place , anyway . And here 's your part of the house . " The wing she was giving over to them was simply furnished in contrast to the clutter elsewhere . In each of the upstairs bedrooms there were two spartan single beds painted white , with the mosquito netting for each gathered and looped overhead on a hoop suspended from the ceiling , a large chest of drawers , its varnish erased by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top and , above this , a small spotted mirror that offered only the dimmest reflection of the face . A wash basin and chair completed the furnishings . The bedroomsmight have been cells in a monastery , places for meditation and penance . Harriet , looking around , noted with approval the bare white-washed walls , the floors that had been scrubbed white also , the windowsopened to the mild wind and the squares of sunlight hanging there like curtains of plain jonquil-yellow cloth . She loved the one indulgent touch of the embroidered scarf on the dresser . The rooms were all she could have asked for . They even made her wonder if there might not after all be something in the woman to which she could respond . For the spare thoughtful way in which she had furnished the rooms suggested to Harriet a longing on her part for a certain order , simplicity , and calm . And turning to her she said , " These are really very pleasant rooms , Mrs. Kinbona . We 're sure to be more than comfortable . " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " This is a nice part of the house . I rather like the old place , you know , even though I 'm always talking about burning it down . It 's gotten so I do n't even mind if no one comes to stay in it . I just wander through the rooms talking to the duppies  --  those 're ghosts , the place is full of them . They do n't mind listening to me and I 'm glad for an audience . " She left moments later , calling over her shoulder that she would send them their lunch and admonishing them to sleep during the worst of the afternoon heat.  |p112Saul  firmly closed , then locked the door , and leaning against it , heaved a loud sigh of relief . " She is exhausting , " Harriest said , laughing . " She just goes on and on , and with that accent and the odd way she puts things I ca n't understand half of what she 's saying , which is probably all to the good . Anyway , the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and these rooms she 's given us will more than do . " " So you like our new digs , ' " he said , and drew her to him . " Very much . Do n't you ? " Holding her lightly against him he looked around him once more , then nodded . After lunch , while the others rested , Allen returned to the small kitchen garden he had started his first visit to Bournehills . It was situated at the north corner of the house not far from Carrington 's gloomy kitchen , away from the steady salt drift off the sea . He had begun it as a favor to Merle , who had complained of the high price of vegetables in town , and also because he had always , secretly , from a boy , loved growing things . And so for weeks after clearing the ground and laying in the mold he had literally coaxed the few vegetables up out of the stony soil while waging a relentless battle with the land crabs that came out to feed at night . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few green frilly rows of carrots and root lettuce , the little cabbages that were just beginning to fold in , and the tomatoes on their ragged vines , the herbs  --  thyme , parsley and dill  --  and he was smiling deeply to himself , unmindful of the heat and the midafternoon sun which had burned away all the blue in the sky and turned the sea to sheet metal , and of the perspiration that was beginning to stream down his face . He took note of the fresh mold and lime she had recently added and the washed seaweed she had spread neatly among the plants as an additional fertilizer . And this , more than anything else , more than the old work pants she had put away for him , which he was wearing now , said that she had remained confident of his return . Seeing the garden intact , it was almost as if he had n't been away . The last year might not have happened . The thought pleased him . He would have preferred that it had never been . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his parents ; in the house that might have been lifted straight out of a Hopper painting , with its fake Aur trian shades at the parlor windows and its impression of small nondoo/script lives within . He had slept once again in his old bedroom upstairs with , on the dresser , the photograph of Jerry Kislak , who had joined the marines the day Allen had entered college and died a month later in an accident in boot camp ; in the bed , chaste and narrow , that he had slept in as a boy . And in a way , he was still , at twenty-six , the virgin he had been then . Because although there had been a few women , his encounters with them had been disastrous , especially the first one , when in his ignorance , fear and distaste , he had put on , one over the other , all three of the prophylactics in the small packet and fled immediately after he was done . The girl , a highschoolclassmate , had cried . He could sometimes still hear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , being back this last year he had felt closer than at any time in his life to the discovery of some mysterious and painful fact about himself which he had always fled , a revelation that would bring with it a dreadful fate he had sensed awaiting him ever since he was a boy . He could n't have said what it was . He did n't even like to think about it . But it was there , he knew , lying in wait for him around a dark turn in his life . Being back in Bournehills was like having been granted a reprieve . The perspiration had trickled down over his glasses and he took them off . And as always happened when he did , everything at a distancevanished and those objects near to hand loomed larger than they actually were . So that the young tender hearts of the cabbages he was gazing down at looked huge . Indeed , the leaves appeared to be foldingin , closing , right before his eyes . And suddenly he thought of the uncle whom he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned the small truck farm in south Jersey . Aside from his friendship with Jerry Kislak , those visits to the farm , which his mother had eventually put a stop to because , in her words , his uncle was " nothing but a common wop " ( she was Scotch-Irish , French , " and a little German , " she liked to boast ) , were all that had distinguished his childhood . At one point his uncle had changed over from vegetables to raising poultry and had lost everything  --  had simply taken a chance , risked himself and lost . For some reason Allen had found this admirable , enviable even . He still did . Once , when his uncle had the truck farm and he had gone to visit him , his uncle had picked a large tomato off the vine and given it to him to eat . The tomato had been so warm from the sun , so ripe and red , he had thought of it , he remembered , as a great heart pulsing away in his palm . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this , perhaps , he had hesitatedbiting into it , and his uncle , his head thrown back , the black hair on his chest coiling out of his T-shirt , had laughed like a pagan , and his thick arms pumping , had cried , " Whassa matter ? Eat it ! Eatit ! "  | " What 's with your friend , Al ? " " Who ? Merle ? " " Yes , " he said . " What 's her story ? How did she come by that big white elephant of a house , for example ? " It was much later that day and they were on their way over to the rumshop in Spiretown , where Merle had said they were expected this evening . Dusk had fallen sometime ago , the abrupt tropical darkness rushing out from the folds of the hills where it had been waiting all day to overwhelm the land . It moved now , a sentient , breathing presence , around the two men , almost like another companion who had decided to accompany them into the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was lighting the way for them along the unpaved road leading from the guesthouse to the village with his flashlight and he had armed himself with a stick to drive off the dogs that would converge on them as soon as they reached the first of the houses . " Her father left her both the house and what little land was left from the original estate . She kept the house but sold the land in small plots to people in the village  --  probably just gave it to them since it 's unlikely any of them would 've had the money to pay her . But she did n't want it to fall into the hands of the Kingsley group , who own practically the entire district . " " How is it she came into everything ? " " She was the only child , an outside ' child , it 's true , as they sayp116around here , meaning outside the pale of marriage , but the only one , nonetheless . Hers is one of those complicated family histories you still find in places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinical way to give the circumstances of her birth , describing how , as was often the case in such liaisons , AshtonVaughan had provided Merle 's mother with her own small house and bit of land . And then one day she had been found mysteriously murdered , shot at close range one morning in the house . " They never found out who did it , but everyone swears that Vaughan 's wife , who was a high-colored ' from town , meaning almost white like Lyle 's wife , Enid , either did it herself or hired someone . No one really knows , though . Merle was the only witness they say , but she was only about two at the time and so , of course , could n't say . " The child Merle had then gone , he said , to live with various members of her mother 's family and had been virtually ignored for years by her father . But when his wife died childless , Vaughan had decided to acknowledge her and had brought her , a girl of thirteen , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his class , sending her to the fashionable girls ' school in town and then afterward to England . " She remained in England for close to fifteen years , I understand , " Allen said . " Just what she did there all that time no one but Lyle Hutson really knows and he does n't ever talk about it . But there 're all sorts of stories . She 's said to have run around with a pretty offbeat crowd for awhile . She studied history for a time at London Ll. , that much is certain , although she never took her degree . She also married and had a child , but it seems the marriage broke up and her husband , who was from East Africa , took the child with him when he returned home . Why did she permit this ? Again , nobody knows except maybe Lyle , because with all the talking she does , she never , but never , talks about any of this . It 's known , though , that she had a breakdown right afterward and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He paused , his voice fading into the darkness , then : " She returned here about eight years ago when she heard her father was dying . But she refused to go and see him . She stayed in town until he died , and then the day after the funeral she came back to live in Bournehills . " " She must have been very bitter against him , " Saul said . " She still is , " said Allen . " She 's always blamed him for what happened to her mother , and she 's never forgiven him for having ignoredp117her all those years . And from what I 've heard , even when he took her in he did n't pay much attention to her , and most of the time , especially when she was going to school , boarded her with an old woman in town whom she calls her aunt and goes to see faithfully twice a week . " " She 's really had a rough time of it . " Saul , thinking of all he had seen in her face as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to himself than to Allen . " Yes , " said Allen , " she has . " Then , his own voice turning in on his thoughts , he added , " Yet , somehow , it has n't gotten the better of her . Oh , she 's a compulsive talker , sure ; and once in awhile she breaks down altogether and just disappears for days in her room . But with all that 's happened to her  --  and there 's a lot as I say I do n't know about  --  she has n't gone under . She 's still Merle , herself , and kind of special . .. . " I had an uncle something like her , " he said after a moment . Behindhis glasses , shining a dull rose in the glow from the flashlight , his hazel eyes were journeying back over the years . Around them the darkness listened and kept pace . " Everything bad happened to the guy , " he said . " At one point he lost everything he owned . Yet he never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never help marveling at people like that , who hold their own , remain themselves , no matter what . It 's a beautiful quality , that , " he said . " Yes , " Saul quietly agreed with him , " it is . " Then , " Tell me , how does Mrs. Kinbona get along with the people here ? " " Oh , just great , " Allen said . " And that includes everyone , from the lowliest weed picker in the fields to the rector of the big Anglican church in the village , who 's a great friend of hers . Everyone thinks she 's a little off , of course , but they like her all the same . The small elite in Spiretown , the headmaster of the school and the like are always talking about her behind her back , but they still invite her to their dull teas and socials . She 's a Vaughan after all , and her father left her that big house and the land . " As for the people at the bottom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called in Bournehills , she can do no wrong . Because although she was raised decent , ' as they say , and has lived in England and hobnobs with bigwigs in town like Lyle Hutson , she 's never put on airs with them . They know she 's on their side and really takes their problems to heart . She feels for us , they say . By the way "  --  the de/tached note returned to his voice  --  " she 'll be invaluable to us in terms of the project , having access as she does to everyone up and down the line . She 's what 's called in the books the perfect cultural broker . " " Well , let 's hope she sticks around then , " Saul said , " because she was saying something today about going back to England . " " Oh , that ! " Allen dismissed it . " She 's always saying that . But she 's not going anywhere . In fact , " he said , becoming once more thoughtful , " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any length of time anyway . She 's become too much a part of the place . In a way I ca n't explain , she somehow is Bournehills . " There was a silence broken only by the steady scrape of their shoes on the path and the loud keening of the sea in the darkness beyond the low dunes . Then Saul , with a laugh , asked , " And where did she get that fancy wreck of a car ? " Allen also laughed . " That 's a story in itself . It belonged to the last English governor before independence . He was a guy , it seems , who believed in living it up big . When he left she somehow managed to get hold of it through Lyle . Knowing Merle , she probably just bought it to get the goat of people in town . I 'm sure it 's the only Bentley on the island . " " Where 'd she get the money for something like that ? " Allen did n't answer immediately , and when he did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes she returned from Englandwith quite a lot of money that had been given to her by some wealthy woman she had been  --  how to put it ?  --  involved with , I guess , for years in London . It was more than just friendship I mean . I told you she ran around with a pretty offbeat crowd over there . " " Oh . . . " he said . Then , with an amazed laugh , " Jesus Christ , your friend Merle is a whole damn research project in herself . " He felt Allen stiffen aggressively , ready to defend her against all calumnies . But he relaxed after a moment and said , " Yes , I never thought of it like that , but I guess in a way she is . " They had reached the village proper by now and at the sound of their footsteps on the paved road the dogs came barking and baying furiously out from under the tiny houses with their steeply pitched roofs and foundations of rough-hewn limestone slabs set at the corners . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the yards as Allen raised his stick and played the flashlight into their glassambereyes . " They 're just saying hello , " he said with a grin . " They have n't seen me in over a year , after all . "  |p119Most  of the houses they passed were already dark , the windows boarded over with shutters that were solid barricades of wood , the jalousies in the door panels tight shut like the lid of an eye . The houses looked utterly abandoned , deserted . At the first sign of dusk their inhabitants might have packed up and gone to spend the night in some distant place to which they also belonged . Only here and there along the road could the ruddy glow of an oil lamp be seen under a shutter propped open on a long pole . And that faint bit of light glowing feebly in the immense darkness was like a small fire in a great stone hearth or in the ancestral cave ; it could have been the first fire said by the Pygmies to have been stolen from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything but the occasional lamplight there were only the sounds to go by ; and these , too , had been altered by the night and invested with meanings they would not have had during the day . The few voices that reached them from time to time from under the partly raised shutters seemed to be speaking , all of them , of love , so murmurous were they in the dark . A baby cried in one of the tightly boarded-up houses , a sharp piercing wail as if it had just broken free of the womb ; and it was as though all of life were being reborn within the darkened room . A bicycle approached on the opposite side of the road . They heard the gentle ticking of the hub , the meditative whirr of the wheels and made out two indistinct forms . Lovers . The man 's long legs akimbo as he slowly pedaled , the girl seated sidesaddle between them and sucking her teeth like a coquetteat something he whispered in her ear . A hymn came to them on the wind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a church situated at the foot of a rise which sloped up from the main road . Through the open doorway he could make out perhaps a dozen or so old women seated on rows of benches under the glare of a kerosenepressure lamp . Most of them were half-asleep , and he thought of the poem he had always loved : " When you are old and grey and full of sleep/And nodding by the fire . . . . " They slept , and the few who were awake offered up the hymn . " Blessed assurance , Jesus is mine , " they sang in flat , quavering , old-women 's voices , giving expression not so much to any certainty of salvation , but to the unspeakable loneliness and melancholy of the tropic night . Hearing them , Saul felt the dull stir of his own loneliness , the one that was with him always , which no woman or friend , not even his work , could ever completely assuage , and he would have gone and sat with them awhile.  |p120Farther  on , nearer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard on the road , and the soft slur and slap of the bare feet on the marl was an infinitely reassuring sound . It said that others like themselves moved unafraid through the night , bent on what seemed a pilgrimage toward the morning . Everyone in passing called " Good night , " and they returned the greeting . Once a woman , recognizing Allen 's voice , paused and called across , " And is that you come back , Mr. Allen ? "  --  ancl she said it without surprise , as if , as Merle had said , no one in Bourneliills had ever doubted his return . " Yes , " he said . " You picked a dark night , " she said , and walked on . " She means , " Allen said , " there 's no moon . " He then led Saul into the bare front yard of what looked to be in the scant light seeping out from the open top half of a Dutch door , a fairly long , narrow building that sagged badly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun-faded advertisements for Coca-Cola , Colgate 's toothpaste and Andrews Liver Salt decorating its front . Along with the weak light issuing from the opened half of the door came the charged strenuous sound of male voices raised in noisy debate . And laughter struck the air like cannonades , igniting the darkness outside . It was music in its own right . A loud and lusty drinking song , a wassail strong and sustained enough to last out the night and usher in the dawn . " Well , the Oxford debates are on full blast , I hear , " Allen said , laughing . But he appeared to falter at that powerful male sound . Hesitant and uncertain suddenly , he paused on the broad square of pitted limestone that served as a step , and his hand on the closed lower half of the door , remained there for a few minutes , long enough for Saul , just behind him , to get a good look of the shop over his shoulder . In the negligible glow of a single small electric-light bulb around which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disguisewhat it was , he saw a dim , rectangular room nominally divided in two by a low partition on the customers ' side of the counter which ran its length . One-half of the room was a general store , with a mere token supply of imported canned goods on the dusty shelves and a few potatoes and onions that had begun to sprout hanging in wire baskets from the blackened rafters . Great casks of pickled meats  --  the fatty ends of beef and pork , and heavy crocus sacks of rice , flour and cornmeal grown musty from the long overseas journey crowded thep121space behind the counter . Added to these was crate upon crate of the dry , malodorous salted cod from Newfoundland , the long , almost fleshless bone of the fish  --  the only part sent to places such as Bourne Island  --  laid out neatly one on top of the other in the long crates , embalmedin salt . The other half of the shop , the part they were gazing into , containedthe bar . Bottles of white and amber rum lined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the counter with their backs to the door . Their voices , grappling like wrestlers back and forth across the room , sent the dust moiling , and threatened , with each outburst , to bring the flimsy walls tumbling down . There seemed to be two main contenders in the debate raging , each with his noisy supporters : one , a short , wiry , resoundingly black man , whose face was drowned in the shadow of a work-stained cap he wore low over his brow . He held a honed billhook  --  the knife used for cutting canes in Bournehills  --  in one hand and , occasionally , to emphasizea point , he would bring it sweeping down in a short chopping arc close to the floor . The long single-edged knife which curved out slightly at the end seemed almost part of the man 's hand the way he held it , something either grafted on or that he 'd been born with : an extra limb nature had bestowed upon him to equip him for his world . His opponent , and the more vociferous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man whose gangling frame appeared strung together by the veins and sinews standing out in sharp relief beneath his dark skin . Everything about him was overstated , exaggerated . His face , his neck , his clean-shaven skull , had the elongated , intentionally distorted look to them of a Benin mask or a sculpted thirteenth-century Ife head . With his long , stretched limbs he could have been a Haitian Houngon man . Or Damballa . Behind the thick lenses of the oldfashionedspectacles he wore , his eyes were huge , sheened , far-seeing . And as he talked he danced , a taut , graceful , highly stylized dance full of little menacing leaps and feints . He would leap back a step , his long legs bent like a fencer 's , his walking stick , a stout length of wood , poised like a sword , and then lunge forward as though to impalehis opponent on the stick 's blunt end . " Be-Jesus Christ , Stinger , you ca n't tell me a shite different , " he was shouting as he lunged forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuffee held off the whole damn British regiment for upward to six months . Not a jack-man of them could get pas ' Cleaver 's High Wall all that time . And all the guns and ammunitions they had did n't countp122for a blast . Cuffee still had them lick . You think he was making any rass-hole sport ? Why man , it got so they was afraid to so much as come near Bournehills . " " Fergy , I do n't give a fuckarse what you say , " the short man said in a somewhat calmer voice , but the billhook that seemed part of his hand came slashing down dangerously close to the other man 's foot . " It was n't no six months . How could he have held out against a whole regiment that long ? It was only two , three months at the most , I tell you . " " Six , I say . Six . It was six ! " the other cried , leaping back to spring , his huge eyes like those of someone in possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bearing it aloft , and the shop reeled under the impact of the word " six ! " " What the bloody hell shite you know about it anyway ? " the tall man cried . " I 'm the one after all who went down to the library in town and read the big book there that tells all about him . And it said six . S-i-x . " He held up six incredibly long , splayed , bony fingers . " You ever read the book ? You ever read any book ? You , Stinger , a man that did n't get past primer standard , who do n't know nothing besides cutting canes and keeping your wife belly full up ! But you best hide yourself and know you 're talking to someone that 's used to reading , who reads the newspapers and knows what 's going on in the world , and who has read the Scriptures backward and forward . Let there be light , ' the Lord said : Genesis one , verse three ; and he was talking about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Stinger man , when he was sharing out the light . You 's one of them still walkingin darkness : Isaiah nine , verse two . " " Fergy , you could quote Scripture till you drop I still say it was only two , three months at the most , " the man named Stinger insisted , his billhook flashing dully in the light as he brought it down again . " Six ! " " What are they arguing about , Al ? " Saul whispered . He understoodlittle of what was being said . The men in the shop might have been speaking something other than English , for they had imposed their own stinging rhythms and harsh , atonal accent upon the language , had infused it with a raw poetry , transforming it , making it their own . " Oh , just about Cuffee and the revolt , " Allen said . " They always ' du when Ferguson has in one too many . " " Delly , will you please tell this nigger man here for me that it wasp123six , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in wide appeal to someone on the other side of the counter , seemed to span the length of the shop . And a calm conciliatory voice issued from behind the massed figures standing in the way . " Well , Fergy , it 's hard to say for sure about something that happened so long ago . But one thing certain , old Cuffee held out to the end . " The crowd shifted , and through a sudden opening Saul saw the man who had spoken . He was lying propped up on a makeshift bed amid the clutter behind the counter , a broken right leg in a cast laid out stiffly on the bed . He was huge , with massive limbs . The leg in the plaster cast was like part of a column to some great temple that had fallen . His aging skin , which was the same deep terra cotta as the walls around him , lay on his frame like a heavy garment that was beginning to weigh him down now that he was old . He called to mind a regent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long reign , but in command still . He was the chief presiding over the nightly palaver in the men 's house . The bed made of packing cases was the royal palanquin . The colorful Harry Truman shirt he had on was his robe of office ; the battered Panama hat , which looked as if the mice in the shop had feasted on the brim , his chieftain 's umbrella , and the bottle of white rum he held within the great curve of his hand , the palm wine with which he kept the palaver and made libationto the ancestral gods . And each time he filled the glasses ranged before him on the counter he made a point of first pouring a drop or two of the rum on the floor beside his improvised bed . He saw the two at the opened top of the door and a bearlike hand with a palm the color of raw veal went up , and in a voice that had his full weight behind it , he called , " Allen , is that you ? What you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger or the other ? Come on in , man . " The voices locked in their pitched battle fell apart and the men , some of them frozen momentarily in the violent attitudes of the argument , turned to the door as Allen , with Saul behind him , opened it and entered . They crowded around Allen , greeting him warmly . And Allen , shaking the black hands thrust at him , kept repeating with a wide boyish smile , " Gosh , it 's good to be back . " Saul , standing forgotten for the moment on the sidelines , saw how deeply he meant it . When it was his turn he took the stiff , work-swollen hands theyp124extended to him as Allen introduced him around . He submitted to the brief but telling scrutiny of eyes that were the same reddish brown as the aged walls of the shop , the man Delbert 's skin , and the amber rum in the bottles on the shelves . Close up , their faces , with the pronounced cheekbones rising out of them like hills and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some spectacularly rugged terrain not unlike Bournehills itself . As he made his way beside Allen through the crowd up to the counter he recognized one or two of the men from the road crew earlier in the day , the gaunt man Desmond Vaughan for one , and the supervisor , Mr. Innis , who , dressed in his hand-me-down bush jacket and plus fours and propped on his stick , stood drinking off by himself at one end of the bar . " Amram ? Amram ? Did I hear Amram . . . ? " the man called Fergusonasked , retaining his hand . His enormous eyes squeezed shut , then snapped open like a window shade being rung up and he gave the little spring back . " Ah , yes ! Amram , son of Kohath and father of Aaron and Moses-self ! " " Not quite , " he said with a laugh . " Mine got changed along the way . It 's A-m-r-o-n . " " Do n't mind , " Ferguson said . " It 's Amram all the same . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large hand first to Allen , then to Saul , the pink-lined palm closing strongly around his . And the man 's eyes held him in as strong a hold . Small , almost lost within the lines of age cutting deep into the flesh , and the color of serum in the grudging glow of the one bulb that lit the shop , they looked scribbled over . All the events of his long life , and of a time that long antedated his life , might have been recorded there like a story on microfilm . " I 'm afraid I ca n't greet you proper , Dr. Amron , because of a bad leg I got here but you 're welcome all the same , " he said . His gaze , like the woman Merle 's , seemed to take in everything about him at a glance , and for a long moment he bent on Saul a look which called to mind the way she had regarded him at the reception : almost as if he was no stranger to Bournehills , but , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , man , you 're back with us again , yes , " he said , turning abruptly to him . " I tell you "  --  Ferguson spoke up before Allen could respond  --  " Allen comes just like General MacArthur in the second big war.  |p125Remember  how the general told the Japanese when they drove him out of some island I shall return , ' and he did  --  well , Allen here told us the said-same thing and look he 's back . Delly , this calls for a grog . Let 's fire one . " And Delbert , first pouring a drop of rum on the floor , filled the small jigger glasses on the scarred counter , adding two for Saul and Allen . They drank , the men tossing off the rum with a deft turn of their wrists and a lovely backward flick of the head . The liquor scarcely touched their tongues going down . The raw rum was a snaking line of fire down Saul 's throat . It brought tears to his eyes . Ferguson , seeing them , laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that your stomach has to get acclimated , that 's all . Why Allen cried like a two-years ' child his first drink . Remember , Allen ? " " It 's pretty strong stuff , all right , " Allen said . " So tell me , Allen , how long are you planning on staying with us this time ? " the shopkeeper , Delbert , asked when the talk and something of the tone in the shop before their entry had been restored . His thick arms were folded on the counter and under his gnawed Panama hat his shrewd , stippled eyes waited . " For quite sometime , this trip , " said Allen . " At least three years or more , off and on . You see , we 're hoping , Dr. Amron and myself , to set up one or two schemes in Bournehills that will maybe help to improve conditions in the district over a period of time . " " Well , yes , " Delbert said . " Mis-Merle did mention your saying something to that effect in your letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only briefly included Saul  --  " can tell us a little more what you have in mind some other day when strong drink is n't raging so about the place . . . . " He motioned benignly toward Ferguson who , along with several others , had retired to a corner of the room and , gathered around a huge , defunct , dust-covered jukebox standing there , was arguing heatedly about which island in the Pacific MacArthur had been driven from . " One thing certain though , " Delbert said over the noise , " we can use any help we can get because things have always been critical clown here . " " Critical ! " Ferguson had heard him and was shouting across . " Critical'snot the word , Delly . Why , Bournehills comes like a nation God has forgot . " " Is true , Fergy , " he said . " Things are bad . In fact "  --  he gave ap126slight , strange , indrawn smile  --  " if they get any worse government 's going to have to declare the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place when a hurricane or a flood or something so comes along and licks down everything ? " He turned with the question to Saul , whom he had been virtually ignoring up to then . " A disaster area , " the latter said . " Ah , yes , that 's it . " He gave a nod ; turned away . " Yes , if things get any worse that 's just what they 're going to have to do , declare the whole place a disaster area and send for the Red Cross . " For some reason this struck him as funny , and throwing back his head , his massive bulk heaving up in the bed as if he had been seized by a sudden pain , he laughed . The laugh  --  loud , toneless and ironic , containing , it seemed , some private meaning not even the men in the shop were privy to  --  began in the depths of his belly and traveled up with a sound almost like that of the sea at Bournehills as it moves in over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It exploded , and the frail walls recoiled as if struck by a tidal wave . And its loud echo lingered . Saul thought he heard it all the time he stood amid the men at the counter , listening to the talk and judiciously now sipping the white searing rum . Something of it remained to puzzle him when , an hour later , he and Allen , quietly discussing the evening between them  --  and they both felt it had gone well  --  slowly returned the way they had come to the guesthouse at the far end of the village.  | " The goddamn Fleet Street bastard ! " He said it in a low undertone , and from behind his clenched teeth so that the words were barely audible . But Merle , her eyes intent on his face , caught the movement of the lips and something of the sound , and she crowed her approval from one of the veranda 's slantedbackchairs where she had gone to sit after handing him the newspaper . " Oh , that 's good , Dr. Amron , first rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's exactly what he is , you know . George Clough would betray his own mother for a headline . " " What is it , Saul ? " Harriet said anxiously . She quickly put aside the late morning cup of coffee she had been drinking and in a gesture she often used with him her hand went out to calm and restrain him . Allen had also started up anxiously and , his gaze moving from Saul 's face to the newspaper in his hands , said , " It 's about the project , is n't it ? What did the so-and-so have to say ? " Instead of answering , Saul simply tossed him the paper and , ignoringHarriet 's restraining hand , began striding up and down , his heavy tread shaking the veranda 's worn floorboards . Allen read aloud the headlines which , done in large bold type , spanned the entire front page :  |p128MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR  DEVELOPMENT SCHEME FOR BOURNEHILLSAMERICANS TO THE RESCUEBOURNEHILLS ON THE RECEIVING END AGAIN "  --  Those 're the headlines , " he said in a stunned voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page . How could he have done something like this ? " Behind the rimless glasses his bewildered gaze followed Saul for a moment , then dropped again to the newspaper . A large American research foundation has announced plans for a massivedevelopment program for the Boumehills Valley District which , if successful , could well revolutionize life in the area within the next few years . The huge scheme will call for hundreds of thousands of dollars , perhapsmillions , according to I ) r . Saul Amron , prominent American social scientist and director of the proposed project , who recently arrived in the island accompanied by his wife and 1 ) r . Allen Fuso , his research associate . This vast sum of money will be pumped into an ailing Bournehills through a variety of programs which Dr. Amron and his associates will develop as they go along , and which are almost certain to transform , in a short time , what has always been the most backward section of the island . The money . . " The bastard ! "  --  and he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allen 's . " And it 's not as if I did n't ask him to go easy on the question of the money . " 1 lc had come to a brief stop . His eyes were flecked red and the curved spine of his nose had gone very white . " In fact , I asked him to go easy on the whole project until we had had a chance to explain it to people here . But no , he talks about ' revolutionizinglife in the area , ' transforming it in a short time . ' Good God , people are going to be expecting the millennium overnight . Talk about cheap irresponsible journalism ! The sonovabitch ! " For a momentthrough his anger he saw George Clough , the manikin face , the small , fine , predatory teeth , the inanimate eyes : " I could tell he was n't to be trusted even before his wife warned me . " He recalled Dorothy Clough dancing with her face resting against Lyle Hutson 's at Sugar 's and muttered , " Serves him right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke into the stride again  --  " and things had gotten off to such a good start the other night at the rumshop . " " Who 's this Clough guy , anyway , Merle ? " Allen asked . " He was n't around when I was here before . " " Who , Georgie ? " She shrugged . Before going on , she drew her legsp129up under her and carefully arranged the wide , floor-length skirt of a maroon-colored tea ( or at-home ) gown she was wearing over them . The gown , with full sleeves and a Mandarin collar , must have been very beautiful in its day , but was badly faded now . " Oh , Georgie , " she said in too light and casual a tone , " is just another one in the pack of advisers , experts and the like from England who are still beating a track to our door even though we 're supposed to be on our own these days  --  free and independent . But it 's our fault since in most cases we ask them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do the job ten times better , but he 's not considered quite good enough in our eyes . Take the new development plan . With all the young bright economists we 've got about the place we still had to send for Waterford , who could n't care less about us , and knows little or nothing about conditions on the island . But we do n't as yet really trust our own ; we do n't really believe deep inside us that we can plan and do for ourselves . I tell you , they colonized our minds but good in this place . In Georgic 's case the big newspaper chain he works for bought out the local paper and sent him down to boost circulation . Go thee and sell papers , they said , and Georgie , good automaton that he is ( look good at his eyes next time , not a bit of life to them ; they 're what you 'd call machine eyes , bo ) , is doing just that . He 's turned it into a cheap , sensational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't stay home nights , but Georgie 's selling papers . And what does he use for news in a place where there has n't been any real news since Cuffee burned down Pyre Hill and ran things around here for awhile ? Everything and nothing . If our dear old do-nothing Prime Minister so much as sneezes that 's cause for a headline : PM SNEEZES IN LEGCO in big print . If a chap falls off his bicycle and skins his knee he 's sure to find his picture on the front page the next day  --  an overnight celebrity ! Westminster Low Road marched off in the rain the morningyou people arrived and Georgie called it DISASTER IN BOURNEHILLS . So just think when he gets hold of some real news like three Americans coming with their moneybags full . Man , there 's no containinghim . " Irresponsible . That was a good word you used before , Doctor , " she said , and her suddenly serious tone brought Saul to a halt in front of her chair . But she did n't see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a soothing hand on the restive sea beyond the veranda railing , were abstracted . The saints on each side of her face were still . " A very good word . But what to expect of Georgie , yes ? After all , " shep130said , the smile flicking open bright and razor sharp , " he 's only the end product of a civilization that never had a reputation for acting in a particularly responsible fashion , that made up its morality as it went along and to suit its convenience . So what to expect . Take for examplewhen Georgie and company were around here selling us for thirty pounds sterling . They somehow put it right with their conscienceby claiming we were n't quite up to standard as the species goes . Go back farther to when Georgie and his crew first arrived over this side . How did they behave toward the people they found here  --  all those poor red Indians up your way , the Caribs down this end , and all the rest whose beautiful house this was . How , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why , I know they finished them off in double-quick time . Gone ! Just so ! An entire people . And all done in the name of some bogus progress . Now I ask you , was that any way for Georgie and them to behave ? I do n't think so . Because when you think of it , they were only , in a manner of speaking , guests in the people 's house  --  and uninvited ones at that . Nobody asked them here . We 're all only guests in the Man 's house when you think of it . And look at how they got on once they came pushing themselves in . Not only did they do away with their host and take over his house , fightingover it among themselves like the thieves they were , but they then took to importing and selling souls  --  black ones but immortal , nonetheless  --  dirt cheap on the open market . The ones who lasted the trip , that is . Because most did n't . They 're out there "  --  she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can scarce find a word about them in the books . And when you dare mention them , as I do out of sheer wickedness from time to time , you get your head handed to you ... . " Ah , well , ah , history  --  " She stretched , the heavy silver at her wrists falling with a loud crash as she raised her arms . " Any of you ever studied it ? " The look , the smile that held everyone to account made the rounds . ' Well , do n't if you have n't . I did for a time  --  West Indianhistory it was and I tell you , it nearly , as we say in Bournehills , set out my head . I had to leave it off . It is a nightmare , as that Irishmansaid , and we have n't awakened from it yet . " Gazing around at the three of them , seeing their strained , embarrassedexpressions and averted eyes , she laughed , a short , sharp , hollow-sounding hoot which said she knew one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she insisted . " Look , do n't mind me , " she said to Saul , standing gazing down atp131her . He felt as he had at the nightclub : trapped , enthralled , as condemned to listen as she was to speak . " I 'm full of irrelevancies . Anyway , if you know what 's good for you , you had best do something about those headlines and do it quick , before you have the whole of Bournehills descending on my guesthouse looking for their share of the multimillions . " " Oh , Christ , yes , " he said , remembering . He resumed his worried pacing . " Saul , do you think it might help if you wrote a letter to the editor pointing out how your comments were misconstrued and explaining the project in the right terms ? " It was Harriet speaking in a voice that like the hand she had extended to him before sought to restrain him . " I do n't know if that 'll do any good , " he said . " The damage has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publish the letter . " " Our best bet , Saul , might be to hold a meeting in the village , " Allen said . " Maybe we could straighten it out that way . " " Yes , " he said , pausing . " I was thinking of that . " " Wait . " Merle spoke up . " I know it 's none of my business but I 'll tell you what . I 'm thinking of giving a party in a day or two  --  oh , nothing elaborate , just what we call a little fete  --  to welcome back Vere and Allen and because , for the first time in a long time , I feel like a party for some reason  --  and if you like you could explain about the article then . Most of Bournehills will be here . I always invite everybody , you know , the great and the small . Throw the whole lot in together , I say . And they all usually come , even though , of course , each group keeps to itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curse upon us . But you 'll have a chance to meet everybody one time ; and since there 's always some speechmaking at a fete in Bournehills  --  we all love to hold forth ; I 'm not the only offender  --  you could have your say then . How 's that ? " He thought for a time , frowning down at the floorboards , his hands deep in his pockets . " Yes , " he said , " that might be a way to do it . We 'll see . " As Merle had said , most of Boumehills came to the party she held two nights later . And this included not only a large cross section of the population of Spiretown , the only genuine village in the district , but also people from the tiny settlements  --  sometimes no more than three or four houses  --  scattered over the outlying hills . The guestsp132the more important ones  --  filled the shabby drawing room , whose tall doors stood open to the night . The rest were gathered in somewhat tense but noisy groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cassia tree which had been hung with a tilly lamp , and in the side yard , where Allen had his garden not far from Carrington 's kitchen door . They sat on the precipitous steps leading down the south wall of the house to the beach and spilled over onto the beach itself , where they stood in great faceless numbers under the farreachingshadow of the veranda , while behind them , down the stretch of shingle , the breakers pounded and clawed at the land . The torn spume , soaring up into the darkness each time a wave struck , was a brief , brilliant pyrotechnic display in the light from the house . But surprisingly , although the guesthouse was crowded both inside and out , the long veranda stood empty  --  this , in spite of the fact that Carrington 's two helpers had set out a table with rum and beer , and the strong kerosene gas lamps glowed a welcome from the overhang to the roof . And it was to remain empty  --  like some no man 's land no one dared cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though Merle kept urging those outside , especially the ones on the darkened beach below , to come up . Periodically , she would lean over the railing and plead with them to come upstairs . But to no avail . Each time she called down they would look off , making it appear that she was speaking to someone other than they , gently ignoring her . As the evening progressed and they still held their ground , her voice took on an increasinglyexasperated note : " But , oh , crime , " she cried angrily at one point , " why wo n't you come upstairs , yes , and stop acting as though you were n't invited to the damn fete , too ? " Inside the drawing room and separated from the guests outside by the empty veranda , Saul , with Harriet at one side and Merle , who was introducing them , at the other , met " the great people " of Bournehillsas they were referred to  --  the postmaster , the magistrate and clerk of the small district court atop Westminster , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , by tradition , mostly white ; the parochial officer , the matron of the almshouse , all of them far less affluent and impressive versions of the people at Lyle Hutson 's reception . The headmaster of the grammar school , a tall , black , elaborately correct man , bowed with old-world courtliness over Harriet 's hand and invited them both to come and see the rosebushes the Queen had planted in the schoolyard on her last visit to the island . And the man/ager of the sugar mill at Cane Vale , a large harried-looking man named Erskine Vaughan , with sandy hair and freckles sprinkled over his tan face ( he was a third cousin of Merle 's ) , gave Saul permission , when he asked , to visit the factory . The men were at one side of the long rectangular room , their wives at the other , the women seated in stiff , almost painful decorum . Their hands , as they held them up to Saul and Harriet , felt boneless . The magistrate 's wife detained Harriet ; and Merle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stole , her hair straightened and drawn back from her face , led Saul over to the rector of the parish church , a bland , weary-eyed Anglican father with olive-tinted skin and a vast sloping front under his white full-skirted cassock which was soiled at the hem . He held the small glass of rum he was nursing between his hands as if it were the eucharistic wine . Slipping her arm through his , she said , " Meet my father-confessor , Dr. Amron . He 's been after my soul for years , even though I keep telling him it 's no use and he 's wasting his time , that God does n't want me . " " Neither does the devil , I 'm beginning to fear , dear Merle , " the rector said . She laughed , impenitent , her head back , and her earrings , the ones with the saints which she wore all the time , performed their jig . " Purgatory then , is that it ? " she cried . " Is that what 's ahead for me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm ready . I 've been in training for it these eight years I 've been back . " With that she held her face up to him for the kiss she demanded from everyone as her due . " The church and the rumshop ! " she said in a scathing aside to Saul as they left the drawing room . " They 're one and the same , you know . Both a damn conspiracy to keep us pacified and in ignorance . Just you wait , though , come the revolution we 're going to ban them both ! " Outside the house , under the lighted cassia tree in front as well as in the yards to the side , Saul met those guests who had not entered the drawing room although the doors stood open to them , and who even refused , until much later in the evening when the speechmakingbegan , to venture onto the veranda . Almost everyone he met there , men and women alike , " worked in the canes " as it was put in Bournehills , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mill . And most , he learned , also cultivated their own tiny plots , sometimes no more than a quarter of an acre adjoining their houses or lying on thep134stony lands north of Spiretown , which they either owned outright or rented from Kingsley and Sons . They had brought with them the strong , fecund , raw-sugar smell of those fields , and this had become part of their own body smell and heat . And the evidence of their labors out under the sun was to be seen in the faces of even the youngest as they stood about the yard , the men talking in small groups while tossing down the little glasses of rum , the women and children standing quietly aside draped like nuns against the night chill in old shawls and lengths of cloth covering their heads . Saul saw several of the men from the rumshop , and he chatted for some time with the cane cutter , Stinger , whose billhook had stung the air repeatedly that first night . Sitting beside him on the steps leading down to the beach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his , spoke of the way in which the crop was harvested . He felt himself drawn to the man by the easy , quietly authoritativeway he spoke of his work and his sober , introspective air ; and above all , by something he sensed behind the eyes half-hidden under the cap he wore , an obscure sadness , an undefined remorse which was like a reflection of the same emotion in himself . He asked if he might come and watch him work sometime . Stinger looked up at him for a moment , his eyes touched by the dull glint from his billhook lying across his knees . ( 1 le was seldom without the knife , Saul was to discover . ) Then , slowly , cryptically , he smiled , more to himself than to Saul . " Yes , " he said , " you must come sometime , ' cause in a manner of speaking maybe that 's what the old place is here for , for people like yourself to come and see what another man 's life is like . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man Vere , for whom the party was also being held , he spied Stinger 's opponent from the rumshop , the tall lean man , Ferguson . He was at the center of a group of men arguing passionately out on the potholed road behind the guesthouse . Ferguson , his thick glasses flashing in the light from the lamp in the cassia tree nearby , was holding forth as usual about Cuffee Ned , his long attenuated body weaving and darting and thrusting like a fencer 's as he harangued the others . The curses flew like spittle from his lips . .. . What the fuckarse you all mean I do n't know what I 'm talking , " he was shouting  --  and again it was almost impossible to make out the words . " He 's goin ' come again I tell you . What the shite you all know ? Cuffee 's goin ' come . Ai n't any of you ignoramuses everp135heard of the second coming ? Well , who the bloody hell you think they was talking about if not Cuffee ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on a pike on Westminster Road that that was the end of him ? You think maybe ' cause he 's been gone a little time that you 'll never see him again ? Oh , ye of little faith ! ' Matthew one , verse three . Disbelievers all . They could n't kill off somebody like Cuffee just like so , do n't you jackasses realize that ? He said as much himself . ' Cording to the book in the big library in town , he laughed when he saw them coming with the ax . He knew there was n't no doing away with him for good . He 's goin ' come again I say  --  or he 's goin ' send somebody just like him , mark my words . You think he was making any rasshole sport . . . ? " With Ferguson 's voice soaring like that of an Old Testament prophet through the yard , Saul moved on , making his way toward the beach on the other side of the house and the guests there whom he had yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly crossed to the stone steps leading down , stopping to introduce himself along the way , how it was that with all the people he had spoken with so far not one of them had referred , even indirectly , to the newspaper article on the project , not even the man Stinger with whom he had talked at length . They might not have seen it . Merle , who had disappeared , returned , bringing Harriet , whom she had rescued from the drawing room , with her . " Ah , so you want to meet that bunch down on the beach , " she said when she learned where he was headed . " Good . Maybe you can get them to stop their nonsense and come upstairs . But first say hello to these ladies over here . " She led them over to a group of old women standing off by themselvesnear the steps . Leesy was among them , looking frail and insubstantialexcept for her tough , work-swollen hands . She was wearing an oversized jacket that had belonged to her late husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rakish angle atop the spotless white cloth she had wound about her head , and her face  --  what little of it that could be seen beneath the hat  --  was as expressionless as always , aloof , inaccessible , her rheumy eyes fey and critical . The other women , swathed like her against the chill , were silent also . But they gave the impression of being on the verge of uttering some word , some dark pronouncementwhich they would intone in prophetic Delphic voices . Under the hats their ancient eyes appeared disdainful of everything around them , of the fete , of the laughter and animated talk filling thep136yard , of the small glasses of rum they held in their hands , of the house , the night , the sea , everything , including Saul 's and Harriet 's hands as they held them out . " Do n't mind how harmless these ladies look , " Merle said laughingly , embracing each of them in turn . " They do n't have a kind word to say about anybody or anything . " " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them said as soon as the three had left . The woman who spoke was so old the irises of her eyes were slowly being eaten away around the edges . She had been humming an atonal hymn under her breath all along , and it continued even as she spoke , underscoring the words . " Did you see the headline , I ask . " She addressed no one in particular . " You think you 's the only body can read a newspaper , Mary Griggs ? " Leesy said in her flat , spare way , staring straight ahead . " I guess it means l3ournehills is going to come like Trinidad soon or one of them other big places . . . " the old woman said , still humming . " Trinidad what ! New York , you mean , " another woman said. . .. with plenty money and thing sharing ' bout the place ... " Mary Griggs continued . " Ha ! " It was Leesy again , and her scathing laugh went beyond cynicism even. " .. . and plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent once again . It was damp and chilly down on the beach , the heavy night dew that had fallen adding to the salt drift off the sea , and the guests there were even more bundled than those above . It was almost as though they were in hiding under the lengths of ragged cloth and bleached flour sacks with which they had all , even the men , cloaked themselves . They stood in scattered groups over the wide strand , looking , as Merle had accused them , as if they had n't been invited to the party but , strolling along the beach and seeing the house afloat like some brightly lighted pleasure boat on the sea of darkness , had paused to look on . Something in the set , still poses they maintained , a tableaulikequality , even suggested that they had simply appeared out of the darkness ; one moment the beach below the guesthouse was empty , the next there they were , a human still life against the night sea . Saul had difficulty making out their faces as he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moved from one to an/other of the static groupings . He had a fleeting impression of the harsh high bones that structured their faces and of their deep-set eyes which seemed to be regarding him from the other end of a long dimly lit corridor , whose distance was measurable both in space and time , and down which he was certain he would have to travel if he were ever to know them or they to know him . Moreover , as he occasionally , with Merle watching , leaned in close to repeat his name over the loud crash of a wave , he had the odd feeling that the youngest among them , including even the babies asleep on their mothers ' breasts , were in some way unimaginably old . Offering his hand , saying simply that he was glad to meet them , he sought , in the brief moments he spent with each , to penetrate the tunnel of their eyes , to get at what lay there . And under cover of the darkness he felt them assessing him : his outer self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never known real physical labor , the eyes that had gone numb after his first wife 's death , the coarse hair that had begun to recede at the temples . They saw even farther , he sensed ; their gaze discovering the badly flawed man within and all the things about him which he would gladly have kept hidden : his deep and abiding dissatisfaction with himself , for one , his large capacity for failing those closest to him , his arrogance , born of that defensivesuperiority which had been his heritage as a Jew , his selfishness  --  for in everything he did , no matter how selfless it might appear , he was always after raising his own stock . . . . And they did the same with Harriet . Turning to where she stood at his side , her hair drawing down the light from the veranda above , they bent on her the same veiled , even gaze from under the cloths covering their heads . And it , too , plumbed deep , reaching behind that unruffled surface of hers which made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile that deferred to them . The masked smiles they gave her in return held a profound recognition . " Pleased to have your acquaintanceship , " they said with Elizabethanformality , and extended their hands in the same slow eloquent manner as they raised them to wave along the roads , that salute which seemed to make of them witnesses after some fact . Their faces , what little of them he had been able to see , remained with Saul long after he and Harriet had returned upstairs . All during the rest of the evening , part of his mind , his thoughts , dwelt on them . He found himself wanting to return to the beach and speak further with them . If he could have done it without appearing impolite , hep138would have liked to probe deeper into those eyes , to understand the meaning of the expression there . The shopkeeper , Delbert , had arrived meanwhile . They had brought him on his palanquin bed over to the guesthouse in the back of the ramshackle pickup truck he used for hauling supplies from town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , out under the cassia . He lay in his loud shirt and chewed Panama hat , the broken leg in its cast . He had been given a water glass half-filled with rum and he drank slowly from this while listening like some gentle , unobtrusivearbiter to the talk around him . And from time to time , for no apparent reason , he would loose the startling laugh that wrenched him like a pain , laughing at the colossal joke that would forever remain private . Behind him , the tall steepled spur of Westminster looming above the house took up the sound and repeated it endlessly . " I see you was in the paper the other day , " he said as Saul , still puzzling over those on the beach , came over to greet him . Delbert was smiling , the smile rearranging the wrinkles that were scored like tribal markings into his flesh ; but the stained eyes under the hatbrim were watchful . " Yes , I know , " he began carefully , noting to himself that Delbert was the first to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the authority to bring it up . " But I 'm afraid the way they wrote about us gives the wrong impression altogether . It makes it look as if we 've come thinking we can work miracles , and that we 've got the money to do it , which just is n't true . I 've been very disturbed about the whole thing and I 've asked Mrs. Kinbona if I might say a few words later to try and set the record straight . " " Well , " Delbert said , the laugh beginning to rumble like a hunger pang , " you 're going to have to speak loud and clear if you want the folks over on that side to hear  --  " the hand with the pink underbelly waved in the direction of the beach . A look passed swiftly between them and was gone . The party had grown more lively by now , due mostly to the rum , but also to Merle who , her voice bearing her along , flitted from one group to another , imparting to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereafter , with a long procession of speakers drawn from every part of the house and yard taking their place on the veranda which was crowded now at both ends with those from outside . Merle spoke first , and standing there with the stole draped acrossp139her shoulders and her eyes giving off their warm light , she looked happy , young . The damaged portrait of the handsome young woman her face called to mind might have been restored . " Well , " she began in her abrupt way , her smile taking them all in , " as you see I 've got a few guests in the place for a change . Things are looking up . . . . " Then , as to be expected , she went on at length . The headmaster of the grammar school followed with an equally long speech welcoming " the strangers from America who have taken up their abode in our humble village . " His talk was interspersed with literary allusions and Latin quotations , each of which was greeted with a loud " Hear ! Hear ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elite gathered in the drawing room doorway as Delbert , speaking from his litter , recalled those who had gone away from Bournehills for what had seemed forever only to return . He cited among these Vere , Allen , Merle , himself . ( He had worked for many years as a young man on the Panama Canal . ) " It 's like there 're some of us the old place just wo n't let go , " he said . Several speakers later Ferguson gave a slightly drunken but movingaccount of life in the district during the reign of his hero , speakingof it with a nostalgia that made it seem he had been alive at the time . " . . . Cuffee had us planting the fields together , I tell you , " he cried . " Reaping our crops together , sharing whatsomever we had with each other . We was a people then , man ; and it was beautiful to see ! " Behind his glasses his oversized eyes were filled with the memory . Vere spoke . Dressed in the blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled , he told briefly of his experiences while away . But he had often , he said , longed for home , and the floor of the veranda shuddered as the guests stamped their feet in approval . Finally , a flushed and ebullient Allen ( he had been drinking beer ) , his happinessat being back evident in his wide grin , introduced Saul . As the latter took his place at the railing midway along the veranda he turned so part of him was to the silent crowd on the beach . It was to them , perhaps more than any other group present , to whom he spoke  --  the holdouts who , in spite of Merle 's pleading , cajoling , and bullying continued to stand like so many ghosts washed up by the sea under the great shadow of the house . His face inclined toward their indistinct forms ; pitting his voice against the sea 's so they might hear him , he spoke to them.  |p140He  dealt first with the newspaper article , saying he was sure many of them were probably wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was true , he said . They had come to Bournehills with the hope in mind of helping to improve life in the district . Unfortunately , he said , the article had overstated matters . " First of all , we do n't have millions of dollars as was stated , " he declared . " We have some money , yes , enough to cover our work for the next few months , and we should be receiving more once we have more definite plans . But it 's unlikely that it will ever be in the millions of dollars . Nor have we come , Dr. Fuso and myself , believing we can revolutionize ' life in Bournehills or transform ' it in a short time . We would n't be so foolish . Nor are we Americans to the Rescue ' as the headline put it . I mention all this because we 're very concernedthat you not get the wrong idea either about us or how much we can do . Perhaps , " he said , " if I tell you in my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope to accomplish while here it might help to clear up any confusion the article might have caused . " Leaning against the railing , part of him to the faceless crowd below , he spoke then of the project , confining himself , as he had done at Lyle Hutson 's , to the first phase of the work . And as he talked , pausing occasionally to search for the right word or when a wave broke with a thunderous detonation on the reefs , drowning out his voice , he sensed that everyone was paying only scant attention to what he was saying . They were more interested in him at this point , it was clear , in the kind of man he was . This , rather than the project which they had probably already dismissed as just another vague scheme destined to fail like all the others , was the basis on which he was being judged , and would be judged in the months to come . He wondered how he would fare . His faults , it had always seemed to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a moment 's glance , seen through to them . But what to do ? His faults , his many shortcomings had become like old friends over the years . He would be a stranger to himself without them . All he could hope for at this late stage was that he might prove acceptable despite them . And understanding all this , he felt suddenly uncertain ( for he might well fail ) , and presumptuous : for who was he to be talking about transformingtheir lives ? And painfully conscious suddenly of his white skin and the meaning it held for people like themselves , he veryp141much wanted their acceptance , especially that of the stubborn guests below , whose faces had eluded him even when he stood up close shaking their hands . " . .. We 've come to learn , " he was saying . " In fact you might say that the next six months to a year will be mainly a period of learning and getting acquainted on both our parts . It will give you a chance to get to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd care to have work along with you in solving some of the district 's problems , and it 'll give us the opportunity to get acquainted with you and learn about life here . There 's a great deal we need to know which you can teach us . We 're interested , for instance , in understanding about the crops and would like to spend some time out in the fields and over at the mill seeing for ourselves how the canes are reaped and the sugar made . We want , in other words , to find out firsthand how you go about your day-to-day life in Bournehills . Also , we 'd like to hear directly from you what you feel are the main things wrong in the district and what in your opinion most needs to be done . " Much of our time , then , these first few months will be pretty much spent walking around observing and occasionally asking some questions . We wo n't , I warn you , look as if we 're doing very much , and some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get around to doing something concrete . But we 'll be hard at work all the same , even though it wo n't look like it . " So , " he said , rising , " you should be seeing quite a lot of us in the coming weeks . I hope you wo n't mind  --  " his smile reached out tentatively . " As for my wife and I , and I know I also speak for Dr. Fuso , we 're very much looking forward to living in Bournehills . I hear you have the best sea air in the world , that it 's known to cure whatever ails someone , so I expect to leave here a new man . " Merle was the first to come over when the applause  --  the light pounding of the right foot on the shaky floorboards which was their way  --  had ceased . " Well , " she said , " you did all right for yourself . " Her face raised to his , she was openly reappraising him . Her smile had little of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , abruptly , she said , " You know one thing , I 'm sorry now about the way I got on at Sugar 's the other night . . . " " That 's all right , " he said with a laugh . " I considered it part of the initiation rites . They 're standard in my profession . " But he spoke absently , because his attention was once again directed to the crowdp142below the veranda . They had not joined in the applause , and peering down through the darkness he saw that the beach was completely deserted . They had quietly  --  every man , woman and child  --  slipped away as soon as he had finished speaking , disappearing so swiftly and soundlessly up the beach it was as if they had simply merged with the night or returned to the sea . It made him wonder for a moment whether they had even been there . " But I wonder why these people from Away ca n't learn , yes , " Leesy said , taking off the fedora and then slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The glass was as dim and mottledas her eyes . " Every time you look here comes another set of them with a big plan . They 're goin ' do this , they 're goin ' do the other , and they end up not doing a blast . And they always got to come during crop when people are busy trying to get their few canes out the ground and over to Cane Vale , always walking about and looking , the lot of them , like they never seen poor people before . I tell you they 's some confused and troubled souls you see them there . . . . " She draped a dark cloth over the mirror so that the ghosts of the family dead would not come to look at themselves while she slept , and then slowly and painfully , wearing a long nightgown that resembled a shroud , she climbed the short stepladder to the high bed in which she had been born , and in which she would die when she felt it was time . She lay like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cus-cus grass , an effigy of someone already dead , utterly still , more selfcontainedand certain in her way than Harriet even . " And it 's not that the gentleman tonight does n't look like he means well , " she said , addressing the shadows which had also arranged themselves for sleep around the room . In the flickering light of the kerosene lamp she kept burning at a low all night they appeared to nod in agreement . " Ile talks direct . He 's a man , you can see , do n't put on no lot of airs like some them who come here calling themselves trying to help . And he 's the first one ever said he wanted to go out in a cane field and see for himself how we have to work . You can tell he 's a decent somebody . But what 's the use ? He 'll never get to know this place . He 'll never understand it . Bournehills ! Change Bournehills ! Improve conditions ! I-la ! " Her laugh was full of a secret knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around here would be to take one of Bryce-Parker 's bulldozers from the conserva/tion scheme and lay the whole place flat flat flat and then start fresh . " After a long silence broken only by the sound of her tangled breathing ( it seemed about to fail at any moment ) , she said , " Multimillions ! " and sucking her teeth , slept.  |p144In  bed also that night under a high white tent of mosquito netting that made her think of an extravagant bridal veil , Harriet quietly went over in her mind her impressions of the evening . Beside her in the mate to the two little narrow , celibate single beds which they had pushed together to form one bed , Saul lay awake , occupied with his own thoughts . Outside the unshaded windows , a tardy moon which had risen just when the party was ending had transformed the entire coast into a moonscape which made her think of the coldly lit surreal world of the sleeping gypsy and lion in the Rousseau painting . As was her custom with each new experience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mind she reserved for that purpose , until such time as she was alone and could go over them at her leisure . It would take her some days , she knew , to sort out her reactions to all she had seen and heard over the course of the long evening , but her immediate feeling , as she began , was that none of it had been as strange or difficult as she had supposed it would be . The main reason for this , she suspected , was that throughout the evening she had felt like one of those special members of the audience in a Restoration theater , notables and the like , who had been permitted to sit on stage during the performance of a play . She had found herself on stage during the somewhat rowdy but interesting drama that had been the party . But although she had been close up on the action , almost part of it , she had nonetheless , by virtue of her seat on thep145sidelines near the wings , remained apart , immune . So that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking , through the gantlet of outstretched black hands , veiled eyes and faces that in their set darkness were as one face endlessly repeated . Even when the party had grown more turbulent and the voices and gestures of the men arguing out on the roadside had threatened violence , she had remainedunperturbed , confident none of it could touch or include her . Because of this the entire evening had seemed easy . " Tonight went rather well , do n't you think , Saul ? " She turned on her pillow to him . " Especially your speech . You very nicely , I thought , cleared up that whole business of the newspaper article , as well as explained what the project really hopes to do . You 're so good at putting things simply . I 'd never have been able to do that . Saul . . . " She waited , then raising up on her elbow leaned toward him , thinking him asleep . By the moonlight filtering in through the net she saw that he was awake . He had n't heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes focusing . She had the sense of his returning from some terribly remote and private place . " Sorry Hatt , I was n't listening . What did you say ? " " I said I thought everything went very well tonight , especially your speech . " " Yes , I think so , too , all things considered . I 'm glad I did as Merle suggested . " " What were you so deep in thought about ? " He moved slightly away . " Oh , I was also thinking about tonight . I still have n't gotten over how fast the folks down on the beach disappearedafter my little talk . " " Yes , I noticed that , too . It was odd . One minute they were there and the next they were gone . And not one of them ever came upstairs , do you realize that ? " " I know . " " They just stood down there the whole time watching everything . And looking so pathetic , " she added after a moment . " I managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we were being introduced , and their faces were so thin you could see all their bones . And so many had hardly any teeth left  --  and not just the old people but even those who you could tell were fairly young . Why 's that , I won-der ? " " What 's there to wonder about ? " he said . " It takes money to go top146the dentist , which they certainly do n't have  --  so when a tooth goes bad , you just pull it out . It 's as simple as that . " " Yes , I suppose so . I do n't know why , but I thought it might be some sort of custom with them . " " It 's got nothing to do with customs , only economics . " They were silent for a time . Then , her face to the ceiling , her voice hushed and tragic under the frothy canopy , she said , " Yesterday , while you and Allen were out , I walked a little way into the village , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside some of the houses on what they call the main road . " She paused ; then , " They were awful , Saul ; worse , I think , than anything I ever saw in North Philadelphia . I do n't see how they can bear living in them . " He stiffened perceptibly , and then slowly , in the dimness , turned to her with the look he sometimes gave her  --  which said that even after their long affair and the year and more of marriage he still did n't know her well enough to know how to take some of the things she said . " It 's not as if they have any choice in the matter , " he said . " They do n't choose to live as they do . " I lis voice was quiet . " Of course not . Oh , Saul "  --  she swung sharply toward him  --  " did I seem to be implying that ? " " I 'm afraid it sounded like it , " he said . His pale eyes with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you know I did n't mean anything like that , do n't you ? " He looked at her for another long moment , then finally gave an uncertain nod . Reaching across she touched the corner of his mouth as if hoping to evoke a forgiving smile . " Darling , you 're going to have to , " she said , " teach me how to say these things so they do n't come out sounding wrong . " He smiled faintly , in response perhaps to her touch ; then , with a sigh , turned away . " I do n't know how much of it can be taught , Hatt . There 're some things you have to come to on your own , if it 's in you to do . " But she had been restored by his smile , and said with a laugh , " All right , if you wo n't teach me , I 'll just have to go around putting my foot in my mouth . No , " she added quickly , " I wo n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really will . " In the long silence that followed , the cloudy tent of mosquito net/ting drew more of the moonlight down onto the bed , and her hair , spread in an orderly halo on the pillow , shone both the wheaten gold that it was and silver . Then suddenly she laughed again . " Oh , those speeches ! There was no end to them . And to make matters worse I hardly understood a word anybody was saying . I refuse to believe they 're actually speakingEnglish . " He laughed sleepily . " Well , they are  --  or a version thereof . " " And the head of the grammar school with his high-flown Latin . I remember wondering if he knew the meaning of half the things he was quoting . By the way , I 'm having tea with his wife on Friday . " " Good , " he said , his voice muffled . He had arranged himself for sleep , his back to her . " That 's your department . " " You 're leaving all the dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mmhuh , that 's your end of the research . " " And who was that huge man who also spoke , the one with his leg in a cast ? You introduced me to him but I 've forgotten his name . " He stirred briefly into wakefulness . " That 's Delbert . He owns the shop I went to our first night here . According to Allen he 's a real power in the village in that he has the respect of the ordinary people . We 're certain to need his acceptance and support if we hope to do anything . " " I see , " she said . " Well , it should all prove very interesting . I 'm looking forward to the next few months . . . . " Then , her own voice becoming murmurous with sleep : " I 'm going to have to ask our landladyfor shades or curtains to put up to the windows for when there 's moonlight . " Then , " And I do n't know which is worse , the mosquitoes or this ridiculous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Saul . . . " But he was asleep , and remembering how distant he had seemed before , as if off in some remote place that excluded her , she turned to draw close to him , only to find that with their movements back and forth , the two beds had moved slightly apart and there was a thin gulf which reached to the floor between them . She would have to get one of the maids tomorrow to fasten together the metal frames along the sides with a length of strong wire.  |p148In  the weeks following the party the first phase of the project got underway . It had been decided as far back as Philadelphia that Saul would devote his time during the initial period to obtaining a general picture of life in Bournehills , largely through observation and interviews , while Allen would concentrate on the more technical end of the research , which was his specialty . So that , for his part , Allen spent those early weeks amassing a wealth of statistical and demographical data . Some days found him poring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the complex of public buildings on top of Westminster ; other days were spent in New Bristol consulting the innumerable records , reports and studies of Bournehills to be found at the various governmentoffices and ministries , and talking to officials . And everywhere he took copious notes , his broad , tough-looking hands with the black hair bunched between the knuckles jotting down the endless numbers and percentages in his notebook with the same rapid stabbing motion of a blind man writing braille . And he always kept his head bent low over the work , hiding the little sensual smile of pleasure , the scholar 's quiet pleasure , which shaped his lips then . He invariably began his day with a visit to the kitchen garden at the north side of the guesthouse . Often waking before the tiny alarm on his moonfaced watch went off or the one old cock Merle kept crowed the dawn in from the bare cassia tree , where it slept amid itsp149hens , he would pull on the work pants she had saved for him , and , after vigorously brushing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been admonished to do as a boy , go out to the garden . As he squatted there , his head bent as though listening to the small sounds the vegetables made as they fought their way up out of the harsh soil , the day would break , the morning unfolding , blossoming , around him . And it was always as if a hand had reached down and snatched away the last of the darkness like a dust sheet to unveil a world that , each dawn , looked new . Perhaps it was the extraordinary freshness and clarity to the air at this hour which made for the impression , or the fact that the few props which comprised the spare landscape of sea , sand , and hill stood out then in such startling relief . Whatever , everything had the appearance of having been newly created : the sea poured fresh into its vast bed during the night , Westminsterraised stone upon stone in the predawn darkness , the sandhills piled up by the wind only moments ago , the cassia planted whole . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea , was treasure , a doubloon from some pirate 's sunken cache . And it was a spendthrift sun which from the moment it appeared lavished its gold upon everything in sight , including Allen , so that his hazel eyes , which Merle had once likened to the stained-glass rose window in the Anglican church in Spiretown because of their mosaic of gray and green and tawny yellow , came warmly alive , and for those moments , he was in touch with the best in himself . Later in the morning , wearing the Bavarian shorts and shortsleevedwhite shirt  --  his uniform when in the field  --  and equipped with notebook and pen , he would set off for New Bristol . He usually took the car , a secondhand English Ford which they bought shortly after their arrival , but often , especially in the beginning , he traveled by the one decrepit Bournehills bus , a converted lorry with widely spaced slats along its open sides to prevent the passengers from sliding out as it took the sharp turns in the road , a tarpaulin roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took the bus it would be crowded with women , their dark faces powdered white for the trip to town and their hair freshly braided under their headcloths . They were the hawkers on their way to New Bristol with baskets of mangoes and breadfruit , and the yams , cassava and sweet potatoes grown amid the canes in the fields . He would sit hemmed in by their thighs and vigorous voices ,  |p150and  sending its fiery glow out to the coast , they swam , just the two of them alone in the heavy , wine-dark sea . They kept pace , their bodies  --  the one white but growing brown from the sun , the other as dark as the sea beneath its fire-lit surface  --  attuned to a single rhythm as they repeatedly circled the pool . Allen was the first to tire , and stumbling back onto the beach he sat in the surf , breathing heavily , the black hair matted on his body , his gaze on Vere . Watching him . His body as he strongly rode the waves . As Allen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks , lifted Vere high and then gently depositedhim in its wake as it came racing on toward the shore . It broke in a furious boil of pebbles and torn spume and stinging sand around Allen . He felt the hard-packed shingle under him give way and the receding wave tugging at him , determined to bear him with it back to the sea . And he let it take him  --  shouting in mock protest , his body a happy sprawl  --  back to the pool , where a laughing Vere awaited him . The next morning , and every morning thereafter , he could be heard singing in the garden at dawn . In contrast to Allen 's carefully planned schedule and well-ordered days , Saul gave the impression of working without any schedule or set plan in mind as he went about his part of the research . Most days found him simply wandering the roads of Spiretown and the surroundingcountryside , his hands in the pockets of his slightly rumpled seersucker pants , his eyes narrowed against the glare and his head bared to the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that walking about without a hat in this Bournehills hot sun will set out your head ? " a woman cried in irritable solicitude from behind the drawn jalousies at her door after he had been there some months . ) During those long , seemingly aimless walks he would stop to chat with anyone who appeared willing . It might be a woman drawing water at a standpipe , a man on his way to or from the fields with his billhook in hand , or a child leading a cow or a string of knobby sheep over to the near grassless pasture where Allen sometimes played soccer . It might be the idlers of the village , most of them young men Vere and Allen 's age , who spent their days lounging on the treeshadedculvert wall over a small river , dry now , which traversed the main road at a point near Delbert 's shop , and their evenings practicing the steel drums for carnival later in the year . To his surprise , nearly everyone he approached seemed willingp153enough to talk with him . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had encountered in other places where he had done field work . Part of it he attributed to the fact that he had come as a friend of Allen 's ; part to the fact that they were used to his kind . He was only the latest , after all , in a long line of strangers who had come seeking to rouse Bournehills . But there was more involved , he sensed , in the ease with which they accepted him . They appeared almost eager to have him observe them at their daily round . Something behind their voices and in their eyes , which even in the daylight seemed to be regarding him from the other end of a long , shadow-filled tunnel ; above all , something in the slow smiles they gave him from time to time encouraged him to look on at their lives , to see for himself how it was with them . Moreover , as the weeks passed , he felt himself being slowly drawn into the life of the place , his day taking on the rhythm and feel of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without being consciousof it , he left off wearing his watch and began telling time by the sun like everyone else . And yet , although this was what he was after , this participation and merging , he could n't help feeling obscurelytroubled by the ease with which it was happening . One of the first places he visited during those early weeks was Cane Vale . The mill , the only one of three left in the district , which meant that it was grossly overworked , was situated just behind the village , at a place where the great northern flank of Westminster flattened out to almost level ground . There , with the permission of the manager , ErskineVaughan , Merle 's tense , anxious relative with the freckled sandcoloredskin , he toured the buildings and wandered on his own around the huge yard , talking informally with the men and observing operations . As the lorries came in laden from the fields they were weighed on a scale set into the ground outside the bookkeeper 's office , a small separatebuilding near the entrance gates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's stool recording the tonnage registered on the indicatorin front of him while Erskine Vaughan hovered worriedly nearby . At times when a donkey cart carrying a small load of peasant canes  --  those which the villagers grew amid the stones in their tiny plots  --  would creak onto the scale , he would dash , fussing , outside . " What , you call these canes , too ? " he would cry , snatching one from the load , his annoyance and disgust causing the freckles to stand out across his broad nose . " These few dried-up sticks you got here.  |p154Ca  n't you see they scarce got any juice in them ? " And they were , for the most part , pitiful  --  thin , and with a parched look to them , like canes left over from a harvest that had taken place many seasons ago . " Ai n't you people heard that Kingsley and them are going to shut down the blasted place any day now because with all the canes we grind we still do n't produce no sugar to speak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind their veiled eyes they would smile at the old threat , recognizing that he said it as they all did , as a precautionary measure , like knocking on wood or making the sign of the cross to ensure its never happening . Once weighed , the canes were scooped up from the trucks by a giant hoist and swung through the bright dust-laden air over to a chute leading into the factory , or if there was a backlog , as was usually the case , they were dumped in a large storage nest made of steel girders outside . The first time Saul entered the factory -- a low sprawling building in serious disrepair , with a torn , rusted galvanized roof and a smokestackrising above it like a great phallus  --  he was reminded of the deep hold of a ship . There was the noise , for one  --  the loud unrelieveddrumming and pounding of the machines that powered the rollers which crushed the juice from the canes , and the shrill , almost human wail of the rollers themselves as they turned in their deep pit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouring up through the metal floor from the furnaces below to join the heat and steam flaring off the large open vats and boilers in which the cane juice was boiled till it turned to sugar . And the light in the place was dim and murky as in the hold of a ship , the color of the molasses bubbling away in the boilers . Moreover , because of the dimness and the cane chaff which came flying up from the roller pit to whirl like a sandstorm through the air , the men working there appeared almost disembodied forms : ghosts they might have been from some long sea voyage taken centuries ago . The tall man , Ferguson , became Saul 's self-appointed guide whenever he visited Cane Vale . And it was a sober , businesslike , albeit voluble , Ferguson then . he had worked at the factory since a boy , from the time , he liked to boast , when the original windmill , the one to which the planter Percy Bryam had been bound , in the story of the Pyre Hill revolt which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The windmill , still to be seen in the yard , was miraculously intact exceptp155for some crumbling away of the stone at its base and the missing sails to its vanes . ) In his younger days Ferguson had operated the giant hoist outside , but now that he was old he worked as a minor overseer , mainly supervising the women and boys who cleaned and oiled the machines . It was also his job to sound the horn that signaled the change in shifts and whose baleful foghorn blast carried clear to Spiretown and even as far as the guesthouse at times . Ferguson 's great pride was the rollers , and whenever Saul dropped in to see him , he would take him up to the platform over the pit which housed them , and leaning over the railing , unmindful of the chaff flying up in his face and the stunning noise , point to the two huge , slowly turning wheels with an air almost of ownership . He worried over them , for like all the equipment in the factory they were overworked , old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last legs , you see them there . They might not even see us through this crop . And I know what I 'm talking ' cause I 'm a man been ' round machines all my life and know them , " he said to Saul one day as they stood on the platform gazing down at the rollers . The whites of his troubled eyes were stained brown by the muddy light ; the planes of his long , boldly sculpted face looked sharper because of the shadows . " They 're only trying their best now ' cause they know we got the crop to get out , but they ca n't last . Man , they 've ground ' nough canes in their time and they 're tired out , old . Why , these rollers have been here longer than me and I 'm no pup . They 've even killed a man . Yes . Neville Walkes , Leesy 's husband , God rest him in his grave . He get a slide one day from this said-same platform and fell into the pit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cane . You think they used to make any rasshole sport ! But they 're near finish now . There 's no way in this Christ world they can last much longer ... " " Does Mr. Vaughan know the shape they 're in ? " Saul asked . " You mean Miss Calamity ! " Ferguson cried contemptuously against the thunderous pulsing around them . ( It was the name everyone called Erskine Vaughan behind his back , given him , it was said , by Merle . ) " How you mean ! ' Course he knows . He have eyes in his damn head , do n't he ? But he would n't ask the Kingsley people to put in new ones not for Thy Kingdom Come ! He 's frighten they 'll get vex with him if he asks for anything . And if anyone here so much as mentions that the rollers are looking bad , he flies up and says it 's because we do n't care them proper . . . . No , man , there 's no talkingp156to Calamity . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red in the dimness as he nodded . " I 'm planning on speaking direct to Sir John , the big boss from England-self , next time he comes to visit . " " Do you think he might be coming this year ? I 'd like to meet him . " " Oh , yes , " Ferguson said . " Ile comes every year  --  he has a big house over to the Crown Beach Colony where he spends his holidays  --  and he always visits Cane Vale then , just to look things over . " Suddenlyhe laughed , the laugh baring the few widely spaced yellowed teeth he had left and bending his body like a wind . " Lord , man , you should see Calamity the day Sir John comes ; he 's near messing in his pants . Yes , I 'm going to speak to the big man himself , " he said , sobering , " even if I got to have in a few grogs to do it . I 'm going to step right up "  --  and he leaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dance he performed while talking  --  " and say , Sir John , sir , please to direct your attention to these rollers you got here . They want changing . We been trying our best with them lo these many years but they 're ready to kick out any day now , so if you know like me you best put some new ones in and quick too . ' Just like that . I 'm not going to bite my tongue . You think I 'm making any rasshole sport . I 'm gon na tell him straight , just the way I 'm telling you . Mark my words . " During those early weeks that were so full they seemed like months , Saul also made a point of visiting the sites of the other projectspreviously attempted in Bournehills , all of which had failed . He saw for himself the pipes for the irrigation system that had never been utilized lying rusted in the tiny fields belonging to the small farmers ; he inspected the roofless crumbling shell of the pottery factory that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work there , and the remains of the little graceless cinder-block houses in the government housing scheme which were overrun with devil grass . In the company of the reticent Australian , Bryce-Parker , he toured the utterly denuded sun-baked lands north of Cane Vale where the soil conservation program was concentrating its efforts . And even as they stood watching the bulldozers and the heavy earthmovingequipment leveling one of the low hillocks nearby , the dry gray soil appeared to be drifting back , piling up again , forming a new hill where the old one had been . Taking Harriet along , he went to see the experimental banana grove the government had started in the hope that the small farmers would start growing them instead of thep157meager canes . But this , too , had had to be abandoned for lack of interest , and the few banana plants that had not been tumbled by the wind stood lopsided and forlorn like scarecrows who had failed at their job . The reasons for the failures were not hard to come by for someone like himself who had spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones , he discovered , after reading the reports and talking with the officials in town who had been involved , which usually defeated such programs : generally poor planning , the condescending attitude of the people in charge , the failure to include the villagers directly in the project from the beginning  --  the failure to prepare the way , in other words . All this and more had made for the defeat . And yet , although the reasons were clear enough and answered his questions , he remainedstrangely dissatisfied , questioning . He could n't help feeling that something apart from the obvious had also been at play . He could n't say why he felt this . But vague and formless though it was , the impression stayed with him , and one day , when he had been in Bournehills for a time , he tried , without even knowing what it was he was after , to talk about it to Delbert . He would often on his walks around Spiretown drop in at the shop . It was his refuge from the hot roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its dimness , kept the heat at bay , so that it was  --  at least during the day  --  quiet , contained , and almost cool . Delbert would be there on his bed behind the counter playing dominoeswith the village butcher , a dour , laconic old man named Collins , who worked only on Sundays when he officiated at the killing of the sheep or pig which took place before dawn in the yard behind the shop . Down the counter from them , the woman who lived with Delbertwould be waiting on the customers in the grocery beyond the low partition which divided the interior in two . The woman , a large , rawbonedBackra , was from Canterbury , a hill southeast of Westminster where everyone in the small settlement there was related and shared the same crinkled , snuff-colored hair , rough reddish near-white skin and the same name , MacFarland . Like the butcher Collins the woman seldom spoke , but would dispense the gill of rice , the few onions , the half-pound of salted cod the customers called for with scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladling kerosene oil into a quart can for a small boy in a dirty singlet and ragged khaki shorts , the seatp158of which had worn away , revealing the dark cheeks of his buttocks . The smell of the oil drifting across to the men in their half of the shop was heavy on the air but not unpleasant . Delbert and Collins were as usual playing dominoes , and for a long time Saul watched their game in silence . Then Delbert remarked that it looked as if the dry season would be a long one this year , and Saul , remembering the rusted pipes lying in the parched fields , said he wondered why people in Bournehills had never used them . They seemed a good idea to him . Or why , for that matter , they had never taken advantage of any of the improvement schemes started by the government . It made him wonder , he said . Delbert , a domino poised in one hand , slowly lifted his head and smiled , the smile a precursor of the laugh that shook the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You ca n't tell , " he said . " Bournehills people are funny , you know . They do n't take easy to anything new , even when it might be to their good . Too set in their ways , I guess . Another thing is the kind of schemes government starts . Most of them do n't suit conditions here . Who told them we could grow bananas on this stone we have for soil ? And who told them we 're a people used to living in any concrete box in a housing scheme ... ? " " But there was nothing wrong with the irrigation pipes , " Saul said . " They would have helped . " " Is true , " he conceded . " Although only a few of the small farmers got the pipes , which was n't right . If you give one , you must give all . But as you say , they would have helped those that had them . What to say , yes ? " he shrugged . I Iis aged massive shoulders were scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old place to stay as is for some reason . I do n't know . One thing certain , these people in government and the ones like yourself from Away need to study their facts better before starting up their big schemes . They need to do like you , man , and come live in the place and speak directly with the people and find out firsthand what 's what . " Then , his gaze taking the other 's measure : " I heard you was out to the fields with Stinger a few days back . " " Yes , " he said . " And I 'm supposed to go with him tomorrow , and this time spend the morning if I can manage the heat . " " Good , " Delbert said . " That 's good . Maybe the more you walk about and see for yourself how things stand with us , the better chance you 'll have of understanding the place one day . ' Cause Bournehillsp159is n't easy to know . It might seem so , and it fools a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He resumed the game . Across the counter from him , next to Saul , Collins had n't once looked up from studying the configuration of dominoes on the scarred wood . He was never to forget the morning he spent in the fields the following day . He had been there , it was true , several times before . In fact , the greater part of those first weeks had been spent out on the high slopes observing the harvesting in the company usually of Stinger , whom he came to know and like so much that after awhile he found himself seeking him out not only for information but for companionship as well . He found himself increasingly drawn to the man , as he had been on the night of the party , by his quietly selfassured , reflective air and the subtle sadness ( or was it remorse ? ) which mirrored something in himself . He went to visit Stinger , taking Harriet along , in the cramped house just up from the main road , where he lived with his commonlawwife , a lively young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnant ( she was now ) , their numerous children ( no one was sure of the exact count ) and one sway-backed cow , gone dry long ago , which they kept tied out back . Every dawn without fail , Stinger , his billhook in hand , would lead the cow on a long journey that took them down the beach past the guesthouse , south to where the sandhillsgave way to a high palisade called Plover Cliff . The cliffs , a way station for migratory plovers long ago , boasted a network of inaccessiblecaves hollowed out by the sea below , and a little grass growing like stubble on top . Stinger would tether the animal there and return for it at dusk . Sometimes , rising earlier than usual , Saul would accompany him out to the cliffs ; and returning they would stop off at the guesthouse for a cup of coffee together . After awhile Stinger often dropped off on his way back to see whether Saul wished to go with him to the fields . If so , they would walk over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising to meet the smoke of the morning fires just beginning to drift from the houses . Usually , he would spend no more than an hour or so out in the cane lands with Stinger . He had often wanted to stay longer , but had found the heat ( especially in the beginning ) overpowering , and the steady climb up the slopes too much for his badly out-of-condition body . Then , too  --  and far more discomforting than the heat  --  was thep160feeling that he had no right to be standing idly by watching their ordeal ( this was the only word for him that came close to describing what he witnessed in those fields ) . At times he felt almost like a voyeur looking on from the immunity of his peephole at another 's debasement . When overcome by this feeling , he would , with a partingword to Stinger , hasten away . But this morning he had decided , feeling somewhat more up to it , to spend the better part of the day out with him . But he had chosen unwisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry season fully underway , the sun , by the time they reached the slopes at eight o'clock and the cutting began , was as hot as it would normally be at noon . Stinger was the boss of his own small work crew which consisted of three other men besides himself who did the cutting , and a number of women , including his pregnant wife , Gwen , called headers , whose job was to gather and tic the canes felled by the men into great bundles which they then bore on their heads down the hillside to the lorries waiting on the road to take them to Cane Vale . Once Saul had tried lifting one of the bundles . It had felt to be well over two hundred pounds . He had barely been able to move it from the ground . Gwen , spotting him , had laughed . " Watch , you do n't break your navel string , " she had said not unkindly . " Your body ai n't use to nothing like this . " As front man Stinger set the pace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was formidable . Following him up the steep shoulder of the hill upon which the field lay , Saul was impressed , amazed . All the strength in the man 's slight , wiry body had been poured , it seemed , in some highly concentrated form , into his right arm , and with this he slashed away without pause at the canes , his billhook describing the same beautifully controlled downward arc as in the rumshop that first night . He worked , silent and absorbed , unmindful of the sun that was like a yellow floodlamp trained on his back and of the heat rising in visible waves from the ground at his feet : " The devil 's pushing the heat , man , " people in Bournehills said  --  and it was as if some diabolicalsmith deep in the earth was working a bellows over an enormous , roaring forge . Stinger , his dirt-stained cap pulled low , did n't even take notice of the estate manager who rode by from time to time at a distance . The manager , one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bournehills white named Pollard , with bleached anony/mous blue eyes and meal-white hair , his lips galled from what seemed centuries of sun . He had once owned the small estate they were workingtoday but he had sold it to the Kingsley group , who had then kept him on as the manager . Pollard still held to the old ways , and always made his rounds dressed in jodhpurs , polished boots , a cork hat and riding a piebald horse . Seeing him ride past in the distance with his large black sun umbrella raised called to mind some ghost who refused to keep to his grave even during the daytime . Stinger never saw him . He saw , was only conscious of , the canes ranked like an opposing army before him up the slope , their long pointed leaves bristling like spears in the wind . To these only did he give his attention , and each time he brought one of them crashing down , he would give a little triumphant grunt ( the only sound he was ever heard to utter while working ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pace , gathering together the canes he flung her way into great sheaves which , with an assist from the other women , she then placed on her head and " headed " down to the truck below . And it was a precarious descent , for the ground would be slick underfoot from the " trash " : the excess leaves the men hacked off the stalks before cutting them , and treacherous with the severed stumps hidden beneath . One bad slip and the neck could snap . But Gwen moved confidently down , as did the other women , her head weaving almost imperceptibly from side to side under its load ( the motion was reminiscent of those child dancers from Bali , but more subtle , more controlled ) , her swollen stomach thrust high and her face partly hidden beneath the thick overhang . The morning seemed interminable even with the brief breaks for water and the longer one for the meal of rice with its gravy of saltfish brought , cooked , with them to the fields , which they took at eleven . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its zenith as it should have as they approached noon , appeared to drop closer , so close finally it looked as though the men could reach up and touch it with their billhooks . Also , by now the heat from below had choked off what little air there had been earlier , and shimmering up in thick waves around them gave the entire scene a feel of unreality , of something taking place at a time long passed . Moreover , as Saul , his eyes inflamedby the fallen sun , glanced up ahead to the portion of the slopingfield which had yet to be done , it struck him that the canes , while giving the impression of retreating , had all the time been swiftly re/grouping , replenishing their ranks , so that there were now as many of them as when the cutting began . And still Stinger pressed the assault , his drenched shirt cleaving to his back like a second skin under which you could see the play of his smallest muscles and the almost matte finish to his blackness . But although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the noon hour passed a transformation that left him shaken and set in motion his own collapse . For one , Stinger 's essentially slight , smallbuiltbody , which was further reduced by the canes towering above him , appeared to be gradually shrinking , becoming smaller and painfullybent , old . By early afternoon all that was left to him it appeared were the shriveled bones and muscles within the drawn sac of skin and the one arm flailing away with a mind and will of its own . He saw , too , that every exposed place on his body  --  his arms , neck , his blind shrunken face , his bare feet  --  was covered with tiny bits of the tough cane peel which flew up along with the thick dust and chaff each time a plant was felled . They were like slivers of wood driven into the flesh . Saul felt them like splinters in his own flesh . But most telling of all was that the low private grunt of triumph which Stinger uttered whenever he sent one of the cane plants toppling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a labored wheeze which came in short desperate gasps  --  and which , in the klieg-light intensity of the afternoon sun , called to mind a winded wrestler being slowly borne down in defeat by an opponent who had proved his superior . Then even as he watched Stinger succumb , Gwen passed him on her way down to the lorry . All along she had been carrying on a lively exchange with the other headers , joking and calling out to them as they bent at their work , but now that the morning had crept into noon and that , in turn , into an afternoon to which there seemed no end , she had fallen silent . And suddenly , she appeared less certain of her footing on the steep grade . The almost offhand confidence of the morning was gone , and like Stinger , who remained absorbed in his cutting to the exclusion of everything else , she was only conscious of the dangerous footing down the hill . The set of her back , the way she stepped  --  first carefully feeling the ground ahead with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had marshaled her slender forces to see her down . She passed , and under the waving green forest on her head , Saul saw her face , a face which when she laughed proved she was still a young woman . But in the short time since he had last glanced herp163way it had aged beyond recognition . A hot gust of wind lifted the overhanging leaves a little higher and he glimpsed her eyes . . . . He tried describing them to himself some days later when he could bring himself to think of them . But he could not , except to say they had had the same slightly turned up , fixed , flat stare that you find upon drawing back the lids of someone asleep or dead . He fled then , forgetting even to take his leave of Stinger as he usually did . His head pounding , eyes burning , unable to breathe in the choked-off air , he groped his way down the shorn hillside , which , with the dust and smoldering heat and the cane trash lying heaped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which two armies had just clashed . He stumbled past Gwen , her head weaving in its subtle dance as she meticulously picked her way down amid the debris . The dead eyes did n't notice him . At the bottom of the hill the jaunty young men whose job was to load the canes onto the lorry waved to him , and he could barely lift his hand to return their greeting ; their faces were a black blur . And he could not say in what direction he was headed as he started off down the road , whether east toward Spiretown and the guesthouse which was his destination or toward the high ridge at Cleaver 's which sealed off Bournehills at its western end . But he had not gone far before he had to stop , as the vertigo which he had felt coming on took hold of him completely , causing the white marl road stretched level in front of him to rise up from its bed and undulate before his eyes and the sun to begin spinning like Ezekiel 's great flaming wheel in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he was struck then , in that moment , there on the road to Spiretown , by a double memory that had about it the quality of a vision . He saw his mother , that absurd , improbable yet intriguing woman , something of whom  --  some small trait or characteristic  --  he had always , without knowing it , sought in every woman he loved . She had had flesh like smooth-churned cream beneath a perennially tanned skin , crimped reddish hair and his same fullness to her lips . She had been a Sephardi , a rarity in the almost exclusively Ashkenazicworld of New York Jewry in which he had passed his childhood . But somewhere back in her line certain of her forebears had been Sephardim who , according to the few remaining threads of their story which she , with her flair for the dramatic , had filled in and enlarged upon , had somehow made their way to South America after the In/quisition and then , slowly , over the generations , journeyed north through the countries of the Americas and the Caribbean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of evidence to support her claim , tombstones bearing the family name on the island of Jamaica . She had never allowed them to forget that special heritage of hers , and to see that they did n't she would periodically treat them to a highly colored yet moving account of that ancient flight , privation and wandering , speaking of it , in her gaudy way , as though it were the one outstanding example of all the suffering known to man . And what had been his father 's response , he who had been the most ordinaryof Jews ? One day , after patiently hearing her out , he had , Saul remembered , slowly raised his heavy eyebrows and , his eyes pale against the singularly pale , almost colorless skin he had bequeathed him , had looked at her very quietly for a long time . Then , as quietly : " So that makes you Roosevelt , maybe ? " he had said and fanned her down . But although her story had been suspect and had even ceased to impress him after a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if one were still a Jew , he had wondered at age eight , thus committing his first heresy and beginning his life-long apostasy ) , it nonetheless came to stand in his child 's mind for the entire twothousand-yearhistory of exile and trial , including the Nazi horror which was still to come when he was a boy . Moreover , her tale , in assuming the proportions of an archetype , a paradigm , in his youthful imagination , also came to embody , without his realizing it ( the story working its powerful alchemy on him when he had been most vulnerable ) , all that any other people had had to endure . It became the means by which he understood the suffering of others . It encompassedthem all . It had even , suddenly , reached across the years to include within its wide meaning what he had just witnessed on the hill . And then before he could recover , her image was replaced by anotherfrom that same time , and he saw with the same frightening sharpness of detail the senile old man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candy store he had passed on his way to and from school . Wearing a soiled tallith , his tangled white beard stained yellowfrom the cigarettes he chain-smoked , he was always , whenever the boy Saul looked up , beating his chest with a frail fist . The old man turned every day into Yom Kippur , atoning not only for his sinsp165but , because of the steady light pounding of that fist day in and day out , for those of the world as well . Years later , when Saul and his family moved to California , a relative had written saying the old man had died , and he had wondered , scarcely conscious of putting the question to himself , who would there be to atone for the world now , who to do daily penance for the host of crimes committed by man against man ? Who would redeem and reconcile them now that he was gone ? He came to himself to find Merle quietly watching him from the window of the Bentley which she had pulled over to the dusty shoulderof the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been for the state he was in , because he had gotten used to being surprised like this by her . Often , walking along the thin edge of some road , on his way back to the guesthouse ( if it was afternoon ) to write up the morning 's observations , he would hear the car in the distance behind him and turning see it swaying , shabby and abused , willfully desecrated , toward him . She would either be returning from her part-time job at the almshouse or from a visit to the old woman in New Bristol with whom her father had boarded her as a girl . The woman , whom she called aunt , Aunt Tie , had become partially blind in her old age and Merle went twice a week to do shopping and other chores for her . She usually spent the night , sleeping in the room that had been hers years ago , and returning to Bournehills the following afternoon . Most times when she stopped for him , the car would be bright with fruit she had bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar apples that looked like small artichokes and fat prickly soursop , which Carrington made into a cool milky drink . The air inside the Bentley would be heavy with their smells , the sweetness of them overwhelmingthe more familiar odor of the hot , worn leather upholstery and Merle 's special essence , a distinctive , not unpleasant mix of the strong English cigarettes she smoked , the lightly scented pomade she used on her hair , the talcum powder she brushed on her neck and in a faintly whitish mask on her face , and the Limacol lotion with its subtle fragrance of fresh lime with which she anointed herself from time to time against the heat . Occasionally , his mind would be so filled with all he had observed over the course of the morning he would n't hear the Bentley until it had pulled up alongside him , and startled , he would turn to find her gazing at him from the open window with the bladelike speculative smile he was slowly getting used to . She invariably followed thep166smile with some remark that was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how 's the investigating business going ? Are you finding out all about us ? " But some days , seeing that he was tired , she would , without a word , lean across and open the door on the other side for him , and grateful , he would take his place beside her on the mate to her sagging front seat . After a time , without realizing it , he found himself listening out for the car whenever he was returning along the roads , hoping to hear her behind him . " What 's it ? " she said now . " llo n't you feel well ? " " It 's nothing , " he said , " 1 'm all right . I just stayed out in the field with Stinger and the others longer than was good for me and got too much sun . It made me a little dizzy , that 's all . " Her eyes narrowing , she scrutinized him , and he quickly averted his face , not wanting her to see how shaken he really was . Worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be able to see , that gaze of hers reaching deep , what had just happened : of how when , for the sake of his own self-preservation , he had fled the scene on the hill , he had been hurled , blinded , hack into his past , into those memories that served as his reference to the world . Perhaps she was even able to see the faces of his mother and the old man still superimposed on the retina of his mind . " Were you on your way home ? " she said . " Yes . " " Then hop in , I 'll give you a drop . " He started toward the car , then stopped , knowing suddenly that as badly as he needed the ride , he could not , feeling as he did , take that endless voice of hers  --  not at such a time . She gave a tight smile . " You do n't feel like hearing me , is that it ? All right , not a word . I promise . " The car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It receivedhim kindly , and resting his head against the seat back he closed his eyes . True to her word , she did n't once speak ; and though she drove swiftly , she did so without her usual recklessness . Soon , feeling a brightness on his eyelids he half opened them to see the sandhills rising golden in the late afternoon light at the end of the long pure stretch of main road which linked Westminster and the sea.  |p167By  the time Harriet finished with their wing of the guesthouse she had transformed it into a comfortable , attractive two-level apartment which not only bore her unmistakable personal stamp but seemed completely separate and apart from the rest of the rambling , cluttered building . The large front room downstairs which opened onto the veranda and also had its own private entrance on the landing to the stone steps leading to the beach , became a sitting room where visitors from the village were entertained ; the one behind this , a dining room where she and Saul often took their meals , especially breakfast , preferringit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs in the main section of the house ; and she turned a good-sized room in the part of the wing which was spared the full brunt of the sea 's steady roar  --  the part facing the potholed road that ran parallel to the guesthouse into the village  --  into a study , where Saul and Allen could work undisturbed . She made desks out of the heavy baronial tables , set up a filing system , and kept a calendar to remind both the men of interviews and appointments they had scheduled . She brightened the rooms with flowers  --  lovely little sturdy mauve-and-white periwinkles and cannas which she found growing wild in sheltered places along the coast . She bought a medicine cabinet in town and stocked it with a few drugs and first-aid supplies to dispense to people in the village . And on top of the medicine cabinet , in a large jar shaped like a fishbowl ,  |p168she  kept candy  --  hard round sour balls and English toffees  --  for the children . They had been the first to come . One morning shortly after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veranda to find a small group of them  --  four girls , a tall string of a boy and a fat naked baby whom one of the little girls was carrying astride her narrow hip  --  standing like characters in a Pirandello play on the beach just below the house . Silent . Their eyes raised unblinking to the veranda , their feet with the small splayed black toes rooted firmly in the sand . Simplypresenting her with the fact of themselves : their thin potbellied bodies , the ragged clothing that hung like seaweed washed up by the tide on their thin frames , their closed expressionless faces . Some carriedchipped enamel basins filled with sand on their heads , balancing them effortlessly there despite the sand 's considerable weight ; others , heavy bundles of the broom sage to be found on the spur of the hill behind the guesthouse . Seeing them there , Harriet almost had the impression they had been standing on the beach all night  --  and even longer than the night , waiting for her to come out . And they scarcely seemed children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and knowing lay within their dark gaze and was suggested by the quality of their stillness . They might have been very old people who had lived out their time , and then instead of dying , had resumed the forms of the children they had once been and begun the life cycle all over again . Moreover  --  and this was also most odd  --  they somehow called to mind the many nieces and nephews of the Negro woman named Alberta  --  AlbertaLee Grant  --  who had been her mother 's personal maid for as long as Harriet could remember . Alberta , with the large industrioushands , the private hum that had been like the sound of her breathing and the impenetrable black skin . ( Once , as a very little girl , Harriet had wondered if the fairies had n't turned her that color because of something naughty she had done . ) Harriet 's mother had insisted on bringing Alberta with her from Virginia when she came to Philadelphia as a bride , and she had remained with them up until the former 's death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a liberal pension which Harriet , through the family lawyer and her close friend , Chester Heald , sent her every month . As children , she and her two brothers , had always , once a year , sent Alberta 's nieces and nephews all the clothes they had outgrown as well as those toys they 'd become bored with . Once , though , she remembered , shep169had refused to part with one of her toys . And it was n't because the toy had been a favorite of hers . She could n't even recall what it had been , it had mattered so little to her . It was just that she had felt she was being asked to give too much and had balked . She had been calm , dry-eyed but unyielding , and when her mother , aghast at her behavior , had insisted that she send the toy , whatever it had been , she had quietly threatened to burn it . She had been allowed to keep it finally , but she had n't ever played with it again .. . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alberta 's young relatives , had never even seen a picture of them , and yet suddenly , for a moment , it was as though she was seeing them in the children below . " Why , good morning , " she said . They did n't respond immediately . Harriet had the impression they were waiting for a prompter to stage-whisper the words they should speak , to give them voice . Seconds passed , and gradually , under their unwavering gaze , which though not unfriendly was neither particularlyfriendly nor even curious , she began to feel uncomfortably , absurdly , like a defendant , the accused , standing in an old-fashioned dock with the children below her silent jurors . It was the veranda railing directly in front of her , with its bleached posts and waist-high bar , and she quickly stepped back . Then , far down the strand a wave broke , sending up a torn curtain of spume , and as the water withdrew and the early morning quiet was restored , the children said , speaking in unison , " Morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while their heads , under the basins of sand and heavy faggots , did n't once move , their eyes , drawn it seemed by a muscle they shared in common , slowly followed her along the veranda , then down the steps , and across the beach to where they stood . " Hello , " she said , coming up . " Are you always up and out so early ? " Again there was a wait , but finally the tall boy , whose long colt 's legs were covered with scabs from the saltfish eaten almost daily , the sores pale whorls against his blackness , said , " We come for sand . " " Oh ? What do you use it for ? " " To spread out in the yard sometimes , and sometimes to use with white lime to scrub down the floor of the house . It have plenty uses . " He spoke without expression . " And sometimes we come for this , " a girl suddenly volunteered . Raising a hand she touched the broom sage under which her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it she said , speak/ing in the same flat manner as the boy , " We use it to sweep round the yard and keep the place tidy . " Harriet smiled , touched by their solemnity . " Well , " she said , " I see there 're any number of things I 'm going to have to learn . Perhaps you 'll teach me some of them . " Then , as they remained silent : " I 'd like that very much . " Still they said nothing , but after a time the small girl with the naked baby who looked larger than she did ( it was certainly fatter ) , propped on her hip , asked abruptly , " You have children ? " " No , " she said  --  and the baby 's eyes , two huge black discs in a field of white seemed to demand the reason for this . " But I hope to someday , " she added . " Is this your brother ? " " Yes , " the child said , and held up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a crab apple with a shriveled purplish red skin . " You have these in America ? " she asked . " I do n't know , " Harriet said . " What is it called ? " " It have a proper name but we call it fat pork . They grow yonder . " With her free hand she indicated the tall palisade called Plover Cliff about a half-mile down the coast . " Have you eat them since you been here ? " " No , " said Harriet . " Not yet . " " You would like to try one maybe ? " " Yes , I might . " " All right , we 'll bring some for you tomorrow . " They turned in a body then and left , and Harriet , smiling to herselfat their odd , old manner , watched them go . Maintaining the same close formation in which they had stood , their loads riding easily on their heads , they walked at a brisk , stiff-legged gait which , somehow , as they moved farther away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that they were being borne back to the village on a moving platform hidden beneath the sand . And yet not to the village . It did n't seem that they were returning to an actual place , but were slowly disappearing , dissolving , ascending into the salt drift curling in like smoke off the sea , which turned everything at a distanceinto a mirage . And they never once looked back . But just secondsbefore they disappeared , vanishing into what struck Harriet as some other time and place from which they had come to assess her , the wind suddenly caught a long streamer from one of the ragged dresses the girls had on and lifted it high , and it was like the child 's thin arm raised in the eloquent Bournehills farewell.  |p171Next  morning she came out to find them assembled in the same formal grouping in the same spot below the veranda  --  and again it was as if they had been there all night waiting for her . The only difference was that today the child with the fat baby on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fruit she had promised instead of sand . Nearly every morning thereafter they were in attendance on the beach , and as the days and then weeks passed , they slowly and beautifully  --  theirteeth very strong and white in their small dark faces  --  began to smile in answer to her smile , and she saw , with immense relief , that they were n't so many old people repeating their lives or vanishing spirits , but only children after all . They were , the children , the first in what quickly became an unendingprocession of visitors . Because soon , people from the village took to dropping in at their wing of the guesthouse . They were mostly the women for whom there was no work on the estates and their silent children , although from time to time , toward evening , one or two of the men might stop in , and with Saul and Allen gone most of the day it was left to her to entertain them . Sometimes , before she could complete the work she did in the mornings , typing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear footsteps on the landing outside or a dark figure would suddenly , like a shadow , appear in the doorway opening onto the veranda , cutting into the sunlight there and startling her  --  and the first visitor for the day would have arrived . They came to sit , to rest out of the heat , to drink the cool fruit juices she served ( she was appalled at the lack of vitaminC in their diets and kept gallon cans of grapefruit and orange and pineapple juice on hand ) , and to talk endlessly among themselves and to her about events in Bournehills both past and present . And peculiarlythey treated the events of the past as though they had only just occurred and treated her , almost from the beginning , as if she somehow knew about them , and was thus no stranger , but part of the place , bound to it and to them in some way . It interested , amused , and vaguely puzzled her , the manner they assumed with her . It might even have annoyed her had it not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's party , that sense of being a spectator seated on stage during the performance of a play , someone virtually right in the middle of the swirling action yet apart , an onlooker . This made possible her adjustment to their rather disconcertingp172ways and , over the weeks , to them in general . After a time it got so their sudden appearance against the sun at the doorway no longer made her start ; they no longer seemed to eclipse all the light in the room as they entered . Soon , anyone seeing her in the midst of a volublecircle of women in the sitting room , listening and occasionally joining in the talk , laughing ; or busy pouring the fruit juices which she sometimes , at their request " sweetened " with a little rum , or dispensingthe few simple drugs in the medicine cabinet : aspirins , cough syrup , dewormer for the children , would have said none of this was strange to her , and she had always lived this way , surrounded by people , in a sea of black faces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to herself . So that early in the morning , usually before Saul awoke and the small band of children , her first visitors for the day , appeared , she would go for a swim alone up the beach at Horseshoe Pool . She loved that lonely swim . The sun would not yet be at full strength and the sea would be chill , still cold from the night and slate-gray beneath its sunlit surface , a northern sea , one to which she felt akin . Then , later in the day when the sun had abated , she would , if there were no visitors , take a solitary walk along the beach , usually in the direction of Plover Cliff which shut off Bournehills to the southeast . There , seated on a warm rock , a few bright strands of her hair lifting in the wind and then gently falling into place again , she would watch the departingsun burn away the harsh edges from Westminster 's tall peaks , leaving them as smooth as the steeples of a country church . Before her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon to dark rose to mauve , while below her , in the inaccessible caves under the cliffs , the sea keened loudly . She scarcely heard the Bournehills sea anymore though . And it was n't that she had gotten used to its special sound , that sustained roar of outrage and grief . She never would . Rather , in that way she had of dealing with anything she found truly unpleasant , she had , working at it quite consciously over the weeks , simply closed her mind to it . Those late afternoon walks of hers became a subject of comment for Merle , perhaps because the latter never walked anywhere if she could help it . She even took the car when going the short distance into Spiretown proper . One early evening , returning from the cliffs with a few of the wild flowers she used to brighten the rooms , Harriet met her at the bottom of the steps hewn out of the ledge upon whichp173the house stood . Merle was setting off for a swim in Horseshoe Pool , wearing an ill-fitting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around her head and carrying a glass containing an inch of rum which she always drank like a dose of medicine immediately upon coming out of the water . " But if you do n't put me in mind of Daphne Pollard , " she said . " And who 's she ? " Harriet spoke absently . Part of her was still sitting on the sun-warmed rocks out at the cliff watching the slow brilliantdemise of the day . " Old Pollard 's sister , " she said , referring to the aged planter-turnedmanagerwho rode the fields on his piebald horse , his sun umbrellaraised . " She 's dead now but when she was alive you 'd see her walking the beach every evening the same as you wrapped in a shawl like it was the dead of winter and wearing her facecloth . " " Her facecloth ? " " Not the one you wash with , " she said . " This was a sort of fine linen mask the great ladies around here used to wear over their faces years back to protect them from the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way down . You never saw what she looked like . And the facecloth still was n't enough . She would have a servant walking along holding a big parasol over her . That woman was frightenedfor the sun , yes ! And she was a great collector of flowers like yourself  --  what few there are around here . She was always stopping and picking . You could n't keep one in the place for her . " Harriet laughed . She had , very early in their stay , decided that the only way to deal with someone like Merle was very politely but firmly to ignore those things about her which were irritating . The smile for one . The sharp , sad empty hoot of a laugh for another . The voice that seemed caught up in some desperate race against both time and itself . And above all the disconcerting , ill-mannered habit she had , which she did only with her , of suddenly , at times , leaning close and , with the odd , off-brown eyes , searching her face as if seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her now , Harriet thought , as if she spied Daphne Pollard lurking somewhere behind her features . ) All this Harriet ignored , and instead , most of the time , treated her as though she were an altogether rational , coherent human being . " Well , " she said with the unperturbed laugh , " I assure you I 'm not Miss Daphne come back to life . After all , I do n't go around wearing a.  |p174shawl  or a facecloth and nobody trails me with an umbrella . I 'm really not that bad . And , " she added , holding up the few periwinkles in her hand , " I 'll put back the flowers if you like . " Merle gazed hard at her for a moment ; then laughed . " Keep them , " she said . ' They 're nothing but weeds , anyway . Wait till the cassia blooms and you 'll see some real flowers . These purplish ones are nice , though , " she said , and reaching out touched one of the little mauve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held the small petal tenderly between her forefinger and thumb , sampling it the way one would fine silk . Harriet , hearing the softness in her voice , remembered how , on that first day , seeing the simple manner in which she had furnished their wing , she had sensed in the woman a muted longing for order , simplicity and repose , and , above all , for an end to the talk . " Yes , " she said , addressing that part of her , " they are nice . The sandhills are the exact same shade of mauve when the sun 's just about to go down . " " Are they ? " Merle cried . " Imagine I 've lived here all this time and never noticed that . Harriet , you should paint . You 've got the eye . " She started to leave , then turned back . " By the way , I saw our rich friend Lyle in town today and he asked for you . He wanted to know how you were bearing up under the strain of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be able to stick it . " " Yes , I know , " she said with a laugh . " He said as much in the hotel bar that first night . It really seems to worry him . I hope you told him I seem to be managing and that the strain , if there 's any , is n't visible yet . " " Yes , I said you were doing all right . More than all right . " It was said with grudging admiration and she began moving away again . " In fact , I told him you 've taken so well to the place and to Bournehills people , and they to you , it does n't seem you 've only been here a few weeks . Your part of the house is always full up with visitors , I told him . And he could n't believe it "  --  this in a loud voice over her retreatingback  --  " when I said you 've even started dropping in to see the Little Fella in his little two by four house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teas at the headmaster 's , the rector 's , and others of the Spiretown elite which she dutifully attended , she had also started , at Saul 's suggestion , returning the visits of the women who came with their barefoot children to crowd their living room every day . At least twice a week she could be seen movingp175around the village from one incredibly small , listing , gray board house to another , paying calls . And seeing her walking along those hot , marl roads , dressed in an oatmeal-colored linen skirt which flared slightly to free her legs , sensible low-heeled shoes and a white blouse , the material of which might have been treated with some special chemical that kept it permanently fresh , one had the impression of someone who had been inoculated against the effects of the sun , heat , dust , and glare . She appeared immunized to all that as she made her way with a light but purposeful step and a smile that in its graciousness declared she had set aside herself entirely for the person she was greeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effortless , something she had done all her life . She had been instructed by Saul to take mental note of any information she thought might be useful to the research , and she did so , taking in everything said in the hot , close drawing rooms where she was entertained , that were no bigger , most of them , than the walk-in closets in her old house near the Proving Ground in Aberdeen . And as Saul had warned her before coming to Bournehills , she made certain not to do or say anything that might be considered interfering in the work of the project . Except once at the home of Stinger and Gwen when , without even stopping to question her actions so certain was she that she was doing right , she had taken matters into her own hands , and as a result , had been severely taken to task by Saul later . She had gone that late afternoon to the hopelessly overcrowded house on the dusty rise up from the main road where Stinger and Gwen lived with their innumerable children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visits she carefully kept . She arrived to find that Gwen had not yet returned from the fields although it was past five , and the children , left alone in the house all day , had had nothing to eat since the midmorning meal at eleven . She could barely make out their individual faces in the interior dimness of the two tiny cluttered rooms , and like . nost people in Bournehills she could not have said just how many of them there were , although they seemed to take up every inch of space in the house . But she could sense their hunger , almost see it . It was like something that had detached itself from their potbellied bodies and round quiet eyes , and assumed an awesome form all its own . And this creature ( for that 's what it seemed to be to her ) had none of their silence and restraint , their resignation , but prowled angrily up and down , its footsteps shakingp176the weak floorboards , its fists pounding the walls , demanding to be appeased . It had even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she entered , shutting her in with them . She was suddenly as trapped as the childrenamid the squalor and the smells of too many bodies crammed into too small a space ; she was as much at the mercy of that palpable hunger as they were . And she would not gain her release , she knew , until she had in some way satisfied their mutual jailor . The oldest child , a girl , had been left in charge , and Harriet , drawing in a determined breath , some resolve coalescing in her , called her over . She came , a frail hesitant girl of perhaps twelve , her breasts just beginning to bud under the rag of a dress she had long outgrown . " Is n't there anything at all to eat , Brenda ? " she said . She could not bring herself to look at her . The child also kept her gaze averted . " No , please , " she said . " Are you sure ? Is n't there perhaps something left over from this morning ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there was nothing in I-Iarriet that could comprehend such a fact , and on sudden impulse she turned from Brenda and made her way out to the shed-roof kitchen , a smoke-blackened lean-to one step down from the house , with a dirt floor , a one-burner kerosene stove on top of a waist-high stone hearth and the walls above the hearth made of evenly spaced slats to let out the smoke . She remained for the longest time in the middle of the kitchen gazing with a kind of numb fixity at the soot-covered pot in which the day 's rice had been cooked . It had been scraped clean . Even the burnt part at the bottom had been eaten . Dusty bars of sunlight rained in through the slatted wall , adding to the staleness and heat , and even , oddly enough , to the sense of dimness there . Outside the doorway to the back yard a young cock reared up and crowed thinly . With her resolve hardening the blue in her eyes she might have well killed and cooked him had she known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown-speckled eggs in a cracked bowl inside the otherwise empty larder . Never thinking to ask herself why they had been left there unused , she strode over to the larder , opened the wire-mesh door , giving it a little yank as it resisted her , and took out the bowl . The eggs were scarcely pullet size , but her disappointment at their smallness only brought her lips together in a more determined line.  | " Brenda . " The child came noiselessly to the doorway behind her , but did not step down into the kitchen . " Yes , Miss Harriet ? " " Is there a frying pan ? " She did n't turn to look at Brenda as she spoke , or at the other children who , curious and intrigued ( as much as they would permit themselves to be ) , had slipped silently up behind their sister , filling the doorway . " Yes , please , " Brenda said . " Would you bring it for me , please . " The child held back a moment , her troubled eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bold enough ; and then brought her the heavy iron skillet . Its bottom and sides were burnt and encrusted but the inside had been scoured clean . Harriet then asked , one by one , for the other things she needed , and Brenda , hesitating briefly each time , brought them  --  the salt and pepper , a fork , the melting lump of strong-smelling , orange-colored butter from New Zealand in a brown paper square that had soaked through , a clean plate . There was no milk , and the thought of that gaunt , dry cow which Stinger faithfully led out to the cliffs each morning brought on a wild momentary despair born of the futility of his devotion and her failure to understand it . Her hand began to tremble slightly , and picking up the fork she dealt the first egg a sharp little whack that broke it cleanly in two . At that Brenda , who had returned to stand in the doorway with the others after lighting the kerosene stove at Harriet 's request , uttered a near-soundless , quickly stifled cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then silently bowed her head . Harriet brought the fork down a second time . When all the eggs lay free of their shells in the bowl  --  the intact yolks like weak suns in an albuminous sky , she added the salt and pepper , then some water in place of the milk , and began beating them with the fork . Her mouth set in its tight grim line , her back to the children , she beat the eggs as if trying to swell them into a greater portion , and until large air bubbles formed . Her forehead became moist and the sunlight striking her hair made it appear a bright helmetshe had donned as part of some battle gear . Her most severe test came during the actual cooking , when she had to struggle with a nausea that threatened to defeat her at the sight ofp178the littered , food-stained hearth , the grease-encrusted pan she had to take by the handle and the suspiciously rancid smell of the butter as she heated it . At one point as she was folding in the omelet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their edge , suddenly blazed up around the pan , and before she could snatch away her arm the heat caused a slight burn on her wrist . It was negligible and left hardly a mark . But the fleeting pain , added to the upheaval in her stomach , along with the knowledge that with all her efforts there would still not be enough to go round , made her , for an uncontrollable moment , want to abandon the entire project and flee . But finally there lay the finished omelet  --  a little too browned on one side , stained orange by the butter and woefully plain ( so unlike the ones she occasionally liked to make with diced meats , herbs and sometimes a little wine ) , but an omelet nonetheless . She was suddenlyinordinately proud of it . There was something of a miracle about it almost ; the fishes and loaves . Above all , she felt an immense relief . She had done her part , she told herself , gazing down at it steaming gently on the plate , to quiet that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She turned then , and for the first time since entering the house really looked at the children . And she was smiling tentatively , and hoping , with a certain wistfulness , to elicit a similiar response from them . Their pleased smiles would have been a small reward . But they continued to regard her with the same flat , noncommittal curiosity , the same quiet refusal to be grateful , impressed or moved , and Brenda stood as she had all along with her head bowed mournfully in their midst . But Harriet was n't overly dismayed by their lack of enthusiasm . She was getting used to the manner of children in Bournehills , their almost frightening reserve , the old way they had about them . Besides , she reminded herself , she had done her part ; the omelet , if no more than a token gesture , was there . It would hold them until Gwen came . " Brenda , I 'm leaving it to you to see that everyone gets his share , " and she tried not to think of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Harriet , " Brenda said without raising her head . She left then , and rather than pass through the close-smelling rooms to the front door , hurried out the back and around the side of the house to the road . She described the afternoon 's adventure later that evening in a let/ter to her old friend and member of the Institute 's Board of Directors , Chester Heald . ( She wrote him at least twice a month , long chatty letters full of her reactions to life in Bournehills which served her as a kind of diary . ) She was just completing the letter when she heard over the somewhat reduced voice of the night sea the sound of their car turning into the guesthouse yard . She glanced at her watch , surprised . She had not expected Saul back so early . He had spent most of the day at a house-raising , where a group of men , well supplied with rum to make the work seem less , got together to put up one of the little boxlike houses of raw Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had supposed he would be stopping off at Delbert 's shop , as he did nearly every night , before coming home . She quickly rose to start the coffee which they always drank upon his return at the end of the day . The coffee was a nightly ritual with them , and Harriet prepared it with something of the care and ceremonythat attends a ritual on the one-burner kerosene stove they had bought for their private use when they had discovered , shortly after their arrival , that neither of them could drink Carrington 's coffee . She treasured this period at the close of the day . The last of the visitors would have left hours ago , Saul 's work would be over , around them the old house would be quiet : Merle and Allen off in their distant wings , and they would be alone together perhaps for the first time all day . Over the coffee which they both took black and without sugar , they would discuss their respective days  --  Saul , relaxed in one of the Morris armchairs with which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress of the work , she telling him who had dropped by and what had been said . And also telling him , each evening , behind the words , that she did it all for him . Every glass of fruit juice she poured for the visitors , every aspirin she shook from the bottle and offered them in the palm of her hand , every scrap of information she carefully stored to pass on to him later , was done for him . To help right the thing in him which she had sensed , on the day they had met over three years ago , had gone awry . And to restore him to the image of him she held in her mind . And to secure their marriage . That hour or so in the late evenings was an important time . Tonight she could tell from the ring of his footsteps on the stone landing outside that something had happened to annoy him , and as she turned toward the door her hand instinctively went out in that lovely gesture which always , at such times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please tell me just what the hell you thought you were doing over at Stinger 's today ? " For a moment she could n't imagine he was speaking to her , and she actually started to look around to see if there were someone else with them in the room . " What did I think I was doing ? " Her voice , her frown , expressed her bewilderment . " I do n't understand . I dropped by this afternoon to pay Gwen a visit ; she was n't there ; only the children ; and they were starving , poor things . So I made them an omelet with a few eggs I found in what they call the larder . That 's all . I was going to tell you about it when you came in . . . . Oh , Saul , do n't tell me I did the wrong thing ! " In the face of her distress he turned aside , ashamed of his anger , and went and sat heavily in one of the Morris chairs . " Oh , Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . Most of the anger had dropped from his voice . " But if only you had thought to ask somebody first . . . . " Then , slumped in the chair , he told her what had happened as a result of her using the eggs . On his way back from the house-raising he had stopped off at Stinger 's , thinking to accompany him on his nightly visit to the rumshop , only to find Gwen quarreling and the child Brenda in tears . Gwen , it seemed , had a longstandingagreement with the Spiretown postmaster to sell him all of her eggs . This money was then used toward purchasing the family 's weekly supply of staples . It was a very carefully worked out arrangementof which Gwen was proud . " Gwen 's not mad at you for having cooked the eggs , " he said . " She understands why you did it , but she blames poor Brenda for not speaking up and telling you who they were for . I 'm afraid she gave her quite a thrashing . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind wheeling back she saw Brenda standing bowed and silent amid her sisters and brothers in the doorway ; she had been resigned even then to the punishment that had followed . " Well , it 'll all blow over , I guess , " he said . " We have to be grateful it was Stinger and Gwen and not someone we have n't gotten to know as well or we might 've really been in trouble . . . . " Then , his annoyancewith her returning , he said , " If only you would stop and ask , Harriet , before taking things into your own hands ! I 'm sure it never even occurred to you to find out if the eggs had n't been left there for a reason . I do n't know , " he said , slowly shaking his head , " there 's this thing in you which makes you want to take over and managep181everything and everybody on your own terms . It really worries me . And it 's not to say you do n't mean well most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But they were hungry ! " Her voice was sharp and emphatic ; she had not permitted herself to hear what he had just said . " Besides , it does n't make any sense to sell perfectly good , nourishing eggs to buy that awful rice they all eat . " " It might not make sense to you , " he said  --  and the harshness had returned to his tone and to his pale , mirrorlike eyes , " but it obviously does to Gwen . She 's probably discovered she can feed more mouths doing it her way . I do n't know . What I do know is that you ca n't go around ordering other people 's lives and trying to make them change long-standing habits overnight  --  especially food habits which are always the hardest to give . Everybody does n't live by your standards . Your values are n't necessarily the world 's . Why , the kids did n't even eat the goddamn omelet . " " They did n't eat it ? " And she was perhaps more stunned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was still there when I dropped by . " But why ? " He shrugged . " Maybe they do n't like their eggs that way . Or they were afraid they 'd really get it from Gwen if they had . I do n't know . Anyway , they did n't touch it . " " They did n't eat it . . . " Her voice was suddenly drained , hollow . " Perfectly good , nourishing eggs . . . I do n't understand . . . " She sank slowly into a chair , and for a time sat there bewildered , silent , crushed , the day that had been so bright with her small triumphlying shattered around her . Her limp arms had fallen open in her lap , revealing the place , just near her right wrist , where the heat from the flames that had flared up around the pan had left a tiny mark . She stared numbly at it . She thought of going over to him and holding out her wrist , silently offering the burn as testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to thrust it angrily under his nose and shout , " See , I even burned myself fixing it for them ! " But instead , her head dropping , she simply covered the spot with her other hand . " I do n't understand , " she said . " Hatt , do you think you might like to go and spend a few days with the Hutsons in town ? " he said . " Remember Lyle said you could come any time you liked . "  |p182Her  head came up and she looked at him with both a child 's hurt and an old woman 's severity . " I do n't need a rest , " she said . " Things are n't getting too much for me . " He started to protest , but instead , his impatience with her getting the better of him he jumped up and strode across to the small kerosenestove on its table on the other side of the room . She had only just started the preparations for the coffee when he entered and he noisily completed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and his tight shoulders shutting her out . When it was done , he brought a cup of the coffee over to her . His face as he held it out was somber and closed , and when she sought his eyes , wanting to express her remorse , to make apology , she found them veiled , distant . " I suspect you 're thinking you were right after all and it was n't such a good idea to bring me along . " She spoke after a long silence . He made no answer , only sat frowning down into the small black pool of coffee in his cup which he held cradled between his palms as if he needed its reassuring warmth . " How was the house-raising ? " She spoke after another silence . His head remained bent a little longer over the cup , and then he said , " Hard work but fun , and very beautiful in a way . The house is only one room scarcely bigger than a closet , but a house nonetheless . The man to whom it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stinger , was years accumulating the money just to buy the lumber . The next thing he 's planning to do now that it 's up is to get married . He 's been going with a woman from Drake Hill who has a couple of kids for him and they 'll be getting married now . " " That 's slightly the reverse of things , is n't it , " she said with a cautiouslaugh . " First having your family and then getting married ? " " I guess , " he said . " But in Bournehills a man does n't believe in makingit legal until he can at least offer his wife a house of her own no matter how small . It 's their way , and as valid , in the final analysis , as any other .... " He paused , a slow smile taking shape . " You should have seen Cox ! He was so happy , poor guy , especially when he saw the roof going up , that he drank too much and passed out on us . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then , the smile giving way to the subtle sadness and irony that was so much a part of him , he said , musing it aloud , " It 's so little for a man to ask of life  --  a closet of a house that 'll start falling apart on him in no time , yet it 's the world to someone here . So that things being relative , Cox could see himselfp183as a man who had succeeded at his life . And he did  --  at least for the time the house was going up . I saw it in his face , and I 'm afraid I also got a little drunk as a result . " Oh , Hatt , " he said , his tone , his smile setting all to rights between them again , " I know I shall probably fall victim again to my emotions and get too involved  --  a defect I 'm known for  --  but I 'm beginning to feel so at home here in Bournehills . It 's as though I 've lived in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Harriet heard this not without a twinge of resentment she was helpless to suppress . " And I so love you , " she said.  |p184After  having looked for weeks , Vere at last found the car he wanted . It was a much used but fairly late model Opel Kapitan , the car made by the General Motors subsidiary in Germany , which combines featuresdrawn from both countries : on one hand , a high-powered Germanmotor , on the other , a long , sleek , low-slung American body that in motion , going very fast , looks like some powerful animal leaping forward to strike . It was the body , perhaps more than anything else , that decided Vere . The Opel had been badly damaged in an accident and with its crumpled fenders and generally battered hull looked fit only for the scrap heap . But Vere , his head cocked thoughtfully to one side , examined it with an expert 's eye ; he tried the motor , sitting tensed forward over the steering wheel listening to it as he fed it the gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nod and purchased it on the spot . He brought it like a bride home to Bournehills . With Allen behind in the Ford giving him an assist on the upgrades and nudging him into motion whenever the motor failed , he gently coaxed the Opel over the hills to Spiretown and finally down the low embankment into the yard adjoining Leesy 's house . Near wreck that it was , it immediatelybecame part of the ancient wreckage in the yard , including the ragged mango and calabash trees , the torn galvanized fence , the wattle-and-daub pen that housed the sow Leesy was planning to have butchered at carnival , and the ramshackle cart she used for haulingp185her canes to the factory . It was instantly at home with the badtemperedfowls who fought each other over the scraps tossed them from the doorway , and the donkey standing , abject and morose , near the cactus bush where the wash was hung to dry . The day Vere brought the Opel home the donkey had slowly raised its head and , its blank eyes filled with the sunlight , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep sucking groans that were like sounds uttered during some protracted and painful coitus . The cry ended , it had resumed its pose of profound dejection and never again acknowledged the car . Nor did Leesy ever really acknowledge it . She never went near it , but would move about the yard at her chores as if unaware of its presence . During the day when she came to the doorway to check the sun or feed the fowls she refused to let her glance as much as pass over it . And in the mornings she would fling the water from her washbasin in a bright arc that fell just short of it . And she never spoke of the car to Vere , and he , feeling the chill wind of her disapproval , thought better than to mention it to her . Only once did she permit herself to comment aloud . It was the day he began the long job of overhauling it . Opening the door a crack she had looked out at him lying sprawled under the car with only his legs showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had looked at the car itself , gazing at it openly for the first time . And as she did so an expression of the most deep-seated distrust , enmity and fear came over her face . It was as though she believed beyond question that all such things as cars , all machines , had human properties , minds and wills of their own , and that these were constantly plotting against those whom they served . They were for her the new gods who , in a far more tyrannical fashion than the old , demanded their sacrifices . Something in her gaze as she stood there peering out , her face as reamed and eaten away by time as the wood of the door , said she feared and detested the Opel straddling Vere as much as she did the rollers at Cane Vale which had crushed and killed her husband years ago . She would have reminded Vere of this ; she even drew a breath to speak , but then in the next instant her resolve gave way , and closing the door she turned back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He and all got a car now ! All the little money he made in Florida gone on some old wreck ! Instead of him using it to buy himself piece of ground or build a house so when he finds himself a woman he'dp186have someplace decent to put her , every penny of it 's gone on a car . He do n't realize that when a person 's just starting out in life he 's got to put first things first and not let a lot of foolishness turn his head . And the first thing a man needs to do is make provision to feed himself so he do n't have to look to nobody and to put a roof over his head . His own roof . Then he 's his own man , what you 'd call an independentperson . " She gave the nod that was like a nervous reflex . " Then if he likes he can start thinking about motorcars ... . " And it would n't even hurt you so if the car was a decent something ! " she suddenly cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , standing there small and dry and outraged , giving vent at last to the anger she had contained since the arrival of the Opel . And she was speaking not only to the shadows that shared the house with them , and the faded photographs of Pearl Bailey and the Queen , but to the painted Christ on the calendar left unchanged since the date of her husband 's death and even the silver plaques inscribed with the names and dates of the family dead mounted on the wall . " But no ! He had to go and throw away good money on some old thing the white people in town did n't want anymore , that they had done run through and lick up and figured they could use now to turn his head . They saw him coming . Because that car 'll never run decent  --  no matter how much fixing he does . I to would have done better to try and build his own car from nothing instead of bothering with that one out there . Why you can tell just from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no good . But what to do ? " Her hands opened in a gesture eloquent of her helplessness . " You could n't say anything to him . It was his money to do with what he pleased . " Leesy was n't the only one who doubted Vere 's wisdom in buying the car . The idlers of the village who whiled away the day on the culvert wall above the dry riverbed along the main road were also convinced that the Opel was beyond repair . Occasionally they would bestir themselves and , leaving the shade of the tamarind tree which stood next to the culvert , stroll over to watch him from the embankmentjust above the yard  --  impressed , envious , but convinced of the futility of his efforts . They teased him : " Vere , man , I see you got yourself a big-time car there . " " But tell me , what junk heap in town did you go to to find that thing , boy ? " " How much you think she 'll do when you 're through with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if she does that much she 'll be doing a lot , lemme tell you . " " Vere , love , I hear you 're planning on entering that vehicle in the Whitmonday Race this year . But take my word , she 'll never leave the starting line . " Vere seldom took them on , but once in a while as their taunts continued to ring through the yard , he would slowly wiggle out from beneath the chassis or raise up from the motor under the hood , and his face , arms , the palms of his hands covered with grease and dirt , smile at them . It was the same patient , quietly superior smile he sometimes gave Leesy when she tried lecturing him , which always made him seem the older and wiser of the two . " But you know , " he might say , leaning casually against the Opel , " you all sound just like what you are : fools who do n't know nothing but sitting under a tamarind tree all day and playing a steel drum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car 's going to pass you going bird-speed down the main road one day and you all goin ' be running after it begging for a ride . " Ferguson dropped by the yard one afternoon to inspect it . The long stick he used like a sword in hand , his eyes wary behind the thicklensedglasses , he slowly circled the Opel , dubiously shaking his head . Vere laughed . " Do n't mind how she looks now , Mr. Ferguson , " he said . " She 's going to come like new time I finished with her , like something I built myself . In a way "  --  his eyes became thoughtful  --  " I do n't even think of it as a car that ever belonged to anybody , but as one I 'm putting together myself from some parts I bought in town . . . " Then , breaking off with an abashed but certain smile , " She 's goin ' run , Mr. Ferguson  --  and soon , mark my words . " " Well , bo , I thought I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but if you can get this one here to work you got me beat , " Ferguson said . Even Allen had his doubts . By the time Vere had acquired the car , Allen had completed the research he had been doing in New Bristol and had started on a fairly large-scale household survey in the village which was to occupy him for the next months , and he had taken to dropping by Leesy 's yard nearly every afternoon , once his interviewingfor the day was over , to see how Vere was progressing with the car . They said little during these visits . Vere would either be halfburiedunder the hood or sprawled like a pinioned Gulliver beneathp188the chassis , while Allen would squat in the dust near his feet with the long questionnaire forms he was using in the survey lying across his knees and his watch and glasses reflecting the late afternoon light . But there was an ease and intimacy between them despite their silence . The steady muffled tapping of the tools Allen handed Vere from a pile lying nearby , a pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a gentle exchange they were carrying on with each other . " How 's it going ? " Allen would ask somewhat worriedly from time to time , as full of doubts as the others . " Do you think she 'll make it ? " And as with Ferguson , Vere would give the confident laugh . " How you mean , man ? She 's going to run , I tell you . I 'm going to have her on the road by carnival  --  before that even  --  if I have to work on her day and night . " And he did devote almost every free moment to it . Sometimes long before Leesy had awakened in the morning or the sky had fully cleared he would be out in the yard , working away in the half-light . In the afternoons he hurried back to it from the job he had gotten since his return as one of the young men who helped to load the estate lorries with the canes the women headed down from the hills . But at least twice a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went to town . Returning from his job he would bathe out in back of the house , where the canes in Leesy 's half-acre plot , pressing up against the house , hid him from view ; then , putting on one of the colorful hot shirts he had bought in Florida and brushing the cane dust from his hair he would take the evening bus into New Bristol . IIe never went to town without taking with him a very slender , supple , notched Malacca cane that had belonged to Leesy 's husband . Leesy had used the same cane to whip Vere with as a boy . But for years it had stood forgotten in a corner of his cubicle of a bedroomoff the kitchen . And then one day shortly after his return he had taken it and very carefully cut off perhaps twelve inches from the bottom , and now each time before setting out for town he would slip the foreshortened walking cane down inside the back of his shirt , hooking its handle over his undershirt so that it lay flat against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you going with that hook stick down your back , Vereson Walkes ? " Leesy very quietly asked him one evening as he was preparing to leave . She was lying frail and stern-faced on a wooden day bed in the small front room where she sometimes rested during the worst of the afternoon heat.  |p189He  said nothing , only offered her a faint , noncommittal smile . " You really intend putting yourself in trouble over that girl , is that it ? Is that it , I ask you ? " she cried , her restraint giving way . " I 'll be back first thing in the morning , " he said . " I 'll bring you some mints from town . " And before she could struggle up from the day bed , he was out the door and on his way down the rutted dirt road that led from their house , which stood on the same dusty rise as Stinger 's , to the main road below , walking with his back held a little too stiff and straight because of the cane . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Bristol . Only a few of the hawkers who roamed the large central bus stand plying the waiting passengers with candies and fruit , which they sold from big trays carried on their heads , would be left when he arrived , and their flat sing-song cries of " Mints , toffees , nuts , who call ? " as they wove in and among the standing buses , their arms swinging free and the trays riding easily aloft , sounded disembodied , forlorn , like the sounds of the expiring day . Over on Queen Street in the heart of the business district the stores would be closed , the smaller ones boarded up tight , while the large department stores , the largest of which was owned by Kingsley , would be ablaze with lights , their windows offeringall such as Vere a feast of things far beyond their means . In the tortuous back alleys and lanes behind Queen Street by this time of evening , the women would have already set up their coal pots in the darkened niche between two houses or on the roadside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boats  --  dolphin and kingfishand red snapper  --  by the smoky light of a soot lamp . The air would be sweet with the seasonings they scored into the flesh of the fish  --  thyme , pounded cloves and hot red peppers . Vere never hurried . Sucking a penny mint bought from a hawker in the bus stand or munching a piece of fish purchased right from the pan , he would stroll at a leisurely pace through New Bristol . Savoring it . Past the banks , the air-conditioned offices , the shop windows with their rich displays ; then down the cobbled alleys to Harbor Road , a narrow strip fronting the bay and lined with warehouses . There he would watch the stevedores who worked the night shift loading the raw sugar onto the ships . He wandered boldly through the fashionableresidential area just outside town where the well-to-do  --  the politicians , professionals , senior civil servants and the few remaining old white families  --  had their homes . The houses ranged from the solidlyp190Georgian to a tasteless , ill-conceived modern , and were set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rows of shade trees positioned like sentries down the drives . To the front , facing the roadway , reared high stone walls with shards of broken bottles cemented along the top to secure them against intruders . 1-Iuge dogs rattled the gates to get at Vere as he passed . Still without hurrying , he would describe a wide semicircle at the end of this section , north to where the ground gradually sloped upwardto a low ridge . There , poised like an ever-present threat above the homes of the well-to-do and running parallel to them into the heart of New Bristol stood the area people in town had recently taken to calling Harlem Heights , a vast fetid shantytown of wooden shacks piled one against the other so that it resembled a fowl run , open scumcovereddrains and narrow dirt tracks that served as roads amid the squalor . It was another city that had quickly spawned in recent years , attaching itself like a great sore to New Bristol below . Viewed from Queen Street it called to mind a hastily erected camp for refugees , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day , especially since independence , they came , abandoning in droves their little villages half-buried amid the canes , led forth by the wonder and dazzle of the store windows along Queen Street and the promise of the lights at night . " Man , I living in town now , you know , " they would boast and everyone would understand they meant Harlem Heights . The girl who had had the child for Vere lived there in a small rented room to the side of a house that was a pastiche of rotted boards , flattened oil drums and scraps of corrugated roofing scavenged from the town below . Taking his time , Vere would make his way through the crowd and stench of the Heights to the house , and once there station himself in the darkened lane across from her window . The shutters were always partly opened and the cheap plastic lace curtains gathered and tied to one side so that he could occasionally glimpse her as she dressed to go out . And as patiently as he had waited outside on the embankment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open the door , he would wait in the darkness for the girl to finish dressing and leave the house . The kerosene lamp would dim finally and she would emerge  --  a tall , thin , sharp-boned girl of perhaps twenty with snuff-colored hair and eyes and the coarse mottled skin typical of those from up Canterbury . Her standard dress was a wide skirt puffed up with layers of can-can petticoats and shoes with heels that were too high for the rutted paths of the Heights.  |p191Vere  would follow her at a discreet distance into New Bristol , then through the bright heart of the town , pausing whenever she paused to stare greedily into the shop windows or to examine her face in the lighted glass . Each night she invariably led him down Whitehall Lane past the bawdy sailor clubs and rumshops lining the street to Sugar 's at the tip of the long finger of land that marked the extremityof the deep bay upon which New Bristol stood . Her petticoats fussing around her knees , she would quickly disappear up the stairs to the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was almost dawn beforeshe finally reappeared . But Vere would wait out the time , standing in the night shadows thrown up by the sea across the street from the club , the foreshortened Malacca cane rubbing gently against his spine whenever he shifted . She might be accompanied when she left by a sailor or one of the young officers or technicians from the missiletrackingstation at the northwest corner of the island . Sometimes she was with one or two of the girls from Sugar 's . Occasionally she left alone . Whatever , Vere would fall in behind her as she moved up the narrow cobblestone street . He never followed her back to her room , but at the top of Whitehall Lane , where all the winding streets of New Bristol converged to plunge together down to the sea , he would leave her without so much as a backward glance and , making his way to the bus stand on the other side of town , spend what was left of the night in the empty bus that would take him back to Bournehills in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But then he had never made any attempt to hide himself . One night as she lingered before one of the department store windows , her head suddenly snapped around and she looked over her shoulder to where he had come to a halt under a street lamp some yards behind to wait for her to continue on . Her face betrayed no surprise at seeing him there . She had known all along , it was clear , that he had been shadowing her , but for reasons of her own had waited until this moment to acknowledgeit . Nor did she speak . She simply stared at him with her flat , tobacco-colored eyes , her chin raised , one bony arm akimbo , ready to brazen it out if he should address her . But he said nothing , only quietly returned her level , unblinking gaze , all the while smiling faintly to himself , his face raised to the lamplight so that she might better see him . They remained like this for a long time , staring at each other across the darkened expanse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impatience , she swung away and , her many petticoats rustling derisively , her high heels clacking loudly , mocking him , walked on . This became something of a ritual with them . On occasion she would pause in a deserted street , turn to face him , wait a few momentsfor him to speak but saying nothing herself , and then when he , too , remained silent , flounce on ahead . After a time these silent exchangestook on , oddly enough , a kind of intimacy . Slowly , over the weeks , it was almost the same as if they had spoken or had approachedand touched each other . Then one night she broke the silence . She had come out of Sugar 's late , accompanied by a blond , very drunk young officer from the trackingstation , who was hanging on her neck and singing in a voice that threatened tears , " Take me home again , Kathleen . . . " Vere had as usual fallen in behind them , when suddenly halfway up Whitehall , in front of one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more out of disgust with the drunken officer on her neck than with him had shouted , " But what in hell are you always following me about like some duppy or the other for ? I got something belonging to you ? " She gave him time to answer and when , as was his custom , he remained silent , she cried , her voice shrill and weary in the empty street  --  she had finally grown tired of their game  --  " Oh , God , man , why you do n't say what you have to say or do what you have to do , damn you , and leave people in peace ! " Again he said nothing , but this time , unlike the others , he had not stopped when she had , but had kept on walking so that he was almost upon them . And she stood her ground , although as he drew near she quickly maneuvered the staggering soldier  --  who was weeping now and calling her Kathleen  --  in front of her . Using him as a shield , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came abreast and screamed , " You keep it up , you hear . You keep on following me about like I got something belonging to you , Vereson Walkes , and as God is my witness I 'm going to put the police on your black tail . " He smiled , the serene little smile which made him appear older and more knowing than most . The eyes slashed in above the jutting bones of his face briefly and with no great interest inspected her in passing ; and then he sauntered ahead , his back as straight as a soldier'sbecause of the cane like a second spine under his shirt , leaving her screaming after him in the road.  |p193At  Lyle Hutson 's touch the Humber shifted smoothly into lower gear , and gathering its full powers swept up the winding road to Westminster'ssummit as effortlessly as if running on level ground . At the final turn the two uneven peaks that crowned the hill appeared with the departing sun cradled between them and the public buildings , including the almshouse , nestled at their feet . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gave the required Bournehills greeting ( he too might have been a witness ) as he sped past Seifert , quietly , as usual , returning the sun 's stare from the almshouse gate . The other inmates , children and adults alike , were wandering aimlessly as usual about the dusty yard in their regulation blue smocks . Lyle both saw and did n't see them . The almshouse , the sleepy police substation next door with its dominoes-playingofficers and telephone that seldom worked quickly vanished , and moments later , just before he took the deep plunge into Spiretown , the whole of the valley with the sea at its head lay before him . And it was as though it had been put there solely for him , for his pleasure . All of it : the village spread at the broad foot of the hill , the clean stretch of road through its center , the low sandhills that brought it to an end , and to the south the guesthouse perched like a small weathered rock on its ledge back from the sea . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of long smooth waves that were like welts raised on its smooth surface , each one beautifully con/trolled , a statement in itself , and soundless at this distance . At this height the horizon appeared a high-tension wire strung between the poles of the land , and the tall clouds banked along its length and purple now with the oncoming dusk could have been the mountainouslandfall of another island in the distance . The day lay behind him , the evening ahead . There would be a swim in Horseshoe Pool with the strong Bournehills sea moving under him like some powerful woman he had roused , and afterward drinks and talk with Merle and the others on the veranda while the air dried the salt from his swim to a fine white dust on his body and pulled his skin taut . And then later , in the large room upstairs looking out over the veranda roof to the sea , which Merle always set aside for him , there would be Dorothy Clough , who had arranged to drive out to Bournehills earlier in the day . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of a man who knows his satisfaction is assured and nothing will be refused him , nothing withheld , he thought of her during their times together , the quality of her passion . It was deceptivelystrong , adventuresome ( so unlike his wife , Enid , in this respect ) , and direct ; and heightened by that faculty she had of making everything they did then seem simply part of their being together . The English . Nothing fazed them . With an idle smile he thought of her thighs arched whitely in the dimness , her mouth ravening with a little girl 's greedy delight the parts of his body ; her tumbled hair against his skin was an imperial fly whisk wielded by an ever-faithful servant . Kenyatta . ( I le laughed out loud and reined in the Humber on the steep drop into the village . ) He became the old Mzee himself then . And her equally delighted cries as he made free with her body , exploring at will her crevices , driving first gently , then hard , then gently into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which he had been granted exclusive right . And as with a man and wife of long and happy standing , everywhere received him gladly . The night would be a fitting end to what had been a long , productiveweek . Lyle Hutson came down to Bournehills at least twice a month , arriving late Friday usually and sometimes staying the weekend . Those at the guesthouse would see the great Humber flashing silver against Westminster 's dun-colored spur as he swung onto the unpaved road leading to the house , with the dust rising in a bright plume behind , and minutes later he would make his appearance on thep195veranda , impeccable in his Savile Row suit , a dull finish to his darkumberskin , his surface smile affixed . Dorothy Clough would already be there , having driven down earlierwith her three children , two lean , sober little girls of six and eight with wisps of sun-whitened blond hair always escaping from their pigtails to stream across their eyes , and a plump boy of three with dimpled knees . During the hours before Lyle 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of embroidery  --  needlepoint or crewelwork design  --  which she always brought along , while down on the beach her children built castles out of the damp sand at the water 's edge . Waiting there , her serene , lightly boned face with its carefully detailed features and thin English skin bent over the square of stamped linen or canvas in the frame , she was in every sense the practical-minded , attractive young matron . From time to time she would rise up a little in her chair to check on her children , a slender hand shading her eyes against the glare off the sand . Harriet found her disconcerting , and even somehow appalling . And it was n't because of the affair she was having  --  married women had affairs after all . Nor was it , she believed , the fact that Lyle Hutsonwas black . She had been told and , to her surprise , had found it to be true that such considerations counted for much less in places like Bourne Island . It did n't seem quite the same thing here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant , direct , level-headed , which somehowmade everything she did , including putting her three children to sleep in the room adjoining the one she occupied with Lyle Hutson , seem perfectly natural . It was the bright faces of the children at the car windows as she drove up and the bit of embroidery she brought with her , and the way she sat plying her needle while awaiting Lyle , like a wife spending the summer at the seashore with the childrenawaiting the weekend visit of her husband . It was the dimples on the little boy 's fat knees as he squatted in the sand helping his sisters build the castles , and the way the three of them rose to chorus " Uncle Lyle " up the beach when Lyle Hutson arrived . .. . All this she found appalling ; impossible to encompass . Worse , she could not as she usually did with such things close her mind to it , and so had taken to avoiding the woman whenever she came to visit . Lyle Hutson she found even harder to take . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand on her arm that night in the hotel bar , and her fleeting impression then that it was less his hand than some dark and submerged part of herself , painful aspects of herselfp196she denied existed , which had suddenly surfaced . She could not quite forgive him for that presumptuous touch . Nor , for some reason , could she reconcile herself to the custom-made suits he wore , the large silver-gray car he drove , the Oxonian accent he affected at times , and his proprietorial air : he would stride onto the veranda of the guesthouseas though he owned it and everyone there ! Moreover , she discovered , after thinking about it vaguely for weeks , that something in the man 's smile , its essentially cold , hermeticquality , vaguely reminded her of Andrew Westerman : his sealed inaccessible face across the dining table and across their separatebeds . It was that both men conveyed the unmistakable impression of having accomplished all they had set out to do with their lives , of being complete and therefore no longer in need of anyone 's help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman could do for them . It would all have been done . if a wife , she would simply be part of the established constellation of their life  --  and not particularly central to it either ; a peripheral star , rather . A mistress would merely be the occasional diversion such men consider their due , one of the small spoils of their success .. . . Men like that , whose lives had achieved a finished form , held absolutely no interest for Harriet . She could feel nothing for them . But perhaps the thing that most galled her about Lyle Hutson was his assumption that she would fail the test of Bournehills . Whenever he came to visit he invariably made reference to that fact , and althoughshe always passed it off with a laugh and remained outwardly unruffled , she would chafe within . Because , in a way , it was like saying she was no better than her mother , that weak , ineffectual woman who had been so easily defeated by everything , and for whom she had always felt such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end like her . Harriet remembered her standing helpless and bewildered outside the locked door of her husband 's study after he took up with Lorenzo de ' Medici , unable to understand that he had shut her out of his life . Harriet recalled the hours she would spend before the tall cheval glass in her bedroom examining her face , her hair , her small , modish figure , while the maid Alberta loomed like an attendant genie behind her in the mirror . But all this had availed her nothing . The door to the study had remained locked . And even when she had tried taking revenge , first in a series of hinted-at affairs ( Chester Heald had been one of the lovers , it was said ) , then in a long vague illness that kept her rooms smelling faintly medicinal forp197months after her death , and finally in death itself , Harriet 's father had scarcely seemed to notice . She had not thought of her in years . As with so much of her past , her mother had been excluded from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks from a comparative stranger , memories of her had begun seeping in like smoke under the door in her mind she kept bolted against her . To have come this far and not to have escaped her ! And Andrew ! And Harriet did n't just mean the eighteen hundred odd miles she had traveled from Philadelphia to Bourne Island . Her marriage to someone like Saul Amron , the daring , the repudiation of the past it represented , was part of the journey she was speaking of , and the whole new life she had chosen with him so that she would not spend the balance of her days seated across the breakfasttable from Andrew Westerman feeling utterly useless and contaminated , made barren , while outside the window a **25;10335;TOOLONG stirred with new life , mocking her . " You know you 're really quite a remarkable woman , Mrs. Amron . " " How 's that ? " she said , turning coolly to him . They had caught her  --  Lyle Hutson , who had just spoken , and Dorothy Clough  --  on the veranda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroll to write a letter to Chester Heald . " The way you 've taken to Bournehills , " he said . " It 's not everyone , as I 've told you before , who can bear the strain . But you appear to have adjusted completely to life in a place which someone once very appropriately described as being behind God 's back . It 's really quite amazing . I was certain you 'd need to escape from time to time and we 'd be seeing something of you down our end . Enid 's always asking for you . She has the guestroom all ready or , again , there 's the small beach house we keep near the Crown Beach Colony , where you 're welcome to stay any time . But so far you refuse to honor us with even the briefest visit . We do n't despair though , since we 're sure to have the pleasure of your company at carnival . Everyone comes to town then , even people in Bournehills . " " Perhaps , " she said . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " Yes . " " You still have a little wait then , do n't you ? " His smile widened but took on no warmth . " Mrs. Amron , I am among the most patient of men , " he said . " Do n't believe a word of it , Mrs. Amron , " Dorothy Clough said ,  |p198looking  up with a laugh from her embroidery . " He 's the most impatientman on earth . " There were only the three of them on the veranda . Harriet , seated a little apart , the unfinished letter on her lap , had thought of making her excuses and leaving , as she usually did , at their appearance . But today something in her refused to concede to them the power to irritateher , and she had remained on . Two chairs away Dorothy Clough was busy working a number of the colored threads through a linen square in a design of tea roses . A mild rum and soda was fitted into the hole on the armrest of her chair made for anchoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sip from the drink and , holding it , lean forward to look out over the railing at her children playing far down the beach . Lyle Hutson , in wet bathing trunks , his own drink in hand , reclinednext to her in an old-fashioned planter 's easy chair , the only one of its kind at the guesthouse . He always claimed it whenever he came to visit . His long legs cradled in the canvas sling suspended between the chair 's lengthy arms , his body very dark against the tan cloth , he was smiling faintly to himself through half-closed eyes , enjoying the aftermath of his swim , feeling still the sensuous heave and fall of the sea under him . Up the beach at Horseshoe Pool , Merle , Allen , and Vere could be seen swimming within the wide half-circle of rock . Around them the day hung fire with a stationary sun lodged betweenWestminster 's spires as if it had gotten stuck there . A patient dusk waited off in the swollen clouds Lyle Hutson had seen piled the length of the horizon from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Dorothy Clough to work by for some time yet . " Do you think you might be playing carnival , Mrs. Amron ? " she asked , turning to IIarriet her friendly gaze . Her eyes , not having the faint touch of gray to be found in Harriet 's , were a clearer blue . She kept at her embroidery while talking . " You mean actually marching in one of the bands in the streets ? " Harriet laughed . " I should think not ! " " Oh , but you should , you know , " the woman said . " It 's the only way to really enjoy carnival . Is n't that so , Lyle ? " His eyes had closed completely . " She 's right , Mrs. Amron , " he said . " You must play mass , ' as we say . " " I 'm planning to , " Dorothy Clough said , turning back to her . " I 'm dressing as a sailor and marching in one of the sailor bands , which arep199always the biggest because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a bit silly , I suppose , but I 'm looking forward to it , especially since this will be my last carnival for some time . We 'll be leaving right afterward , you know . George 's work here is just about over . It 'll be back to dear , sooty old London for us . But I must say it 's been a marvelous holiday . " " We shall miss you , old girl , " Lyle Hutson said . " No , you wo n't , you unfeeling man , " she said . Her expression as she looked across at him stretched out , eyes closed , in the planter 's chair , was both fond and sad . " Not for long at any rate . 1 suspect you 've already decided on my replacement . " He laughed , and Dorothy Clough , her needle poised above the cloth in its round frame , turned and said to Harriet  --  and it was impossible to tell whether she was being serious , " Do you know , Mrs. Amron , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George , who even though he sometimes does naughty things as a newspaper editor , is n't really a bad sort , if I thought for a moment the gentleman here would have me . But I know better . " " Why not take your chances if you feel that strongly about it , " Harriet said . She began gathering together the items on her lap  --  the letter paper , the air mail envelope , her pen and the clipboard she used to write on . " Oh , I 'm not such a romantic ! " Dorothy Clough said . " Am I , Lyle ? " " No , thank God , " he said  --  and they both laughed . " But getting back to carnival  --  you must really give it a try , " she said after a time as Harriet did n't leave . " It can be quite an experience . I remember my first one . We had only just arrived in the island and I could n't believe my eyes when I saw all these people dancing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that ! I was shocked to the depths of my solidly middle-class English soul . I rememberstanding there gaping in the most idiotic fashion for the longesttime , and then there was a big commotion in the crowd around me and I found myself pushed right out into the middle of the people marching . I was sure it was the end . But do you know , once I got my feet untangled and saw I was n't really going to be trampled to death I rather began to enjoy myself . After awhile it seemed the most natural thing in the world to be dancing in the streets in the middle of the day . It made perfectly good sense . I must have gone on for hours . I got horribly sunburnt , of course , and ruined a perfectly good pair of shoes , but I had a grand time . And best of all I met a delightful chapp200who took me in hand and taught me the proper steps . He was a waiter at one of the hotels and was all dressed up as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mane on his head which he kept tossing about , bells on his ankles and a long spear "  --  her arms , very slender and white , opened to indicate its length ; she gave Harriet her pleasant , good-natured smile . " We stayed together for the entire march . I 'm sure if George had seen us he would have put our picture on the front page of the paper as an example of the democratic spirit of carnival . " " All o ' we is one , ' " Lyle Hutson said , speaking in the marked island accent . His eyes remained closed . " That 's the saying at carnival , " she explained to Harriet . " I think it 's beautifully put , do n't you ? And it 's true more or less for the two days carnival lasts . You see all sorts of people , rich and poor , black , white , and in-between , dancing together in the streets , laughing and talking to each other . It 's a marvelous sight , and a much needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us manage to be so ugly to each other , especially over this whole stupid question of race and color . And matters seem to he getting worse . Even my country 's joined in the game now that a few Pakistanis and West Indians have gone there to live . All one can hope is that things do n't get as bad as in your country or that dreadful South Africa . " " I do n't see how you can speak of the two countries in the same breath . The situations are by no means the same , " Harriet said sharply , but she felt a great reluctance to take the woman on . She had always disliked discussing the subject ; she even disliked acknowledgingto herself that the problem existed , and it was one of the things she had long closed her mind to . " At least , " she said , " we 're attempting to solve matters in a sensible fashion . There 're laws now against discrimination and various government programs . . . " " Yes , but none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the terrible trend of things there recently ? " Dorothy Clough said . She had n't missed a stitch . " It 's sad to say , but I 'm afraid we shall be done in , the great white race , by our niggardliness and bad faith , our refusal to really take down and make room for the other fellow . Anyway , one has to be grateful for holidays like carnival where if only for two days people can behave as though we 're truly one . . . . " And , " she added reflectively , putting down her needlework , " one must also be grateful for places like Bourne Island , where it 's possible to meet and be with whomever one pleases without all the fuss andp201unpleasantness one often encounters at home . This is n't to say one does n't eventually return home and pretty much resume the old life , but it 's important , I believe , to have had the experience . I know I shall always be grateful for the year and more we 've spent here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course . But I think it 's made me a bit of a better person . . . " She broke off on the same reflective note , and turning to Lyle Hutsonwith a tentative smile , said , " Have you been listening , darling ? I just gave a little speech . " " I heard you , girl , " he said . " I heard you . " Squl had come out on the veranda meanwhile . He had been inside writing up the morning 's work in the quiet back room Harriet had converted into a study for him and Allen . He had joined them just as Dorothy Clough was describing how she had been pushed into the midst of the marchers her first carnival . After half-listening to her for a time , seated on the armrest of Harriet 's chair with his arm draped lightly around her shoulder , he had wandered off to the other end of the veranda out of reach of their voices so that he had missed the brief clash between the two women . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his mind the material he had just recorded while absently watching the Clough children playing down at the water 's edge . The two girls , reaching up from time to time to wipe the strands of hair from their eyes , were building an elaborate sand castle right where the waves were breaking , while their small brother stood on his stout legs nearby solemnly watching them . But they were building too close to the edge , allowing no room for the early evening sea . The spume from each breaking wave was already beginning to foam and hiss around the castle and nibble at its base . Finally a wave dark with the oncoming night and swollen by the rising tide suddenly charged up the beach and washing over the castle with a roar reduced it in a matter of seconds to a few indistinct lumps . The little boy immediatelyplunked down in the retreating surf and began to cry ; but his two sisters , after soberly contemplating their ruined handiwork , kneelingthere in the wet sand with their arms akimbo , began rebuilding in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move higher up the beach , and then did n't . Something in the willful set of their lean , tanned shouldersstopped him . And feeling a strange futility he looked away , his gaze traveling the short distance to Horseshoe Pool . Vere and Allenp202were still in the water , but Merle , who never stayed in long , was sitting close to shore on one of the flat rocks that formed the pool 's protective barrier holding the small glass of rum she always drank right after a swim to warm her . She looked , he thought with a smile , like some dark , squat attendant spirit of the sea , who had clambered up out of her dwelling place to sample the world of men for a time . She was talking . He could tell from her gestures and the way her body was pressed forward  --  and he substituted her voice for Dorothy Clough 's , reaching him remotely from the other end of the veranda . As he watched , a wave came sweeping in low over the rock upon which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her waist as a lover 's arm . The spume reached up as though to kiss her cheek , and laughing she raised her glass out of the way . He thought he heard the crash of her many bracelets as her arm went up . He was certain he heard her laugh . A short time later she was standing in their midst on the veranda ( Saul had meanwhile rejoined the others ) in the shapeless black bathing suit which revealed her body 's slow decline . He saw the slight telltale droop to her breasts which were not much larger , he judged , than those of the little bony adolescent hostesses in Sugar 's , the weariedflesh of her upper arm which shuddered whenever she gestured strongly , all the slowly slackening , aging lines which she did n't even bother trying to hide with the large beach towel she had draped across her shoulders . Things that would have displeased him , even offended him in another woman somehow pleased him in her . He did not understand it . " How was the water ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turning to him with a soft , abstracted smile , the private sun in her eyes , " Like wine , Saul Amron , like wine . I 've never seen the sea so lovely . I hated to leave , and as you can see , Vere and Allen are still in . You should have joined us , but then I 've noticed "  --  her smile took on its familiar edge  --  " that you do n't seem too particular about the sea . " " I 'm not , " he said . " But had I known it was like wine I might have relented and come in . " " And what about you ? " she said to Harriet . " Not guilty , " Harriet said with a laugh , and raised her right hand . " I was in this morning long before any of you were up , and although the water was n't anything like wine then , it was still pleasant . " " Brr ! " said Merle , " I do n't see how you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wrapping the beach towel around her she settled into her chair . " Ah , " she began , bracing her bare feet against the posts of the railing directly in front and taking up her cigarettes which she had left on the arm of the chair , " What more to ask of life , yes ? A sea bath at the end of the day . A drink or two afterward . Some old talk with friends . Small pleasures , but they hold up till the end . Right , Lyle ? " She glanced over to where he lay with his eyes closed and drink in hand in the chair next to Dorothy Clough . " But look at you lying there like some Indian rajah ! " she cried mockingly . Her gaze was warm , though , and it lingered appreciatively on his dark , fit body in the bathing trunks . With a sigh she drew the beach towel closer around herself . " You must have had a good week , " she said  --  and a bitterness born of an envy she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bribes did you take ? " He laughed , and raising up briefly , blew her a kiss . " I always have a good week , " he said . " With or without the bribes . And why not ? I live good , man "  --  he spoke in dialect . " You know that . As the young chaps used to say , I living good , I living right , but muh clothes at muh mother 's . ' " " What did they mean by that , Lyle ? " Dorothy Clough asked , lookingup from her work . " Well , " he said , " when a fellow had a girl friend he might be sleepingat her place every night , practically living with her , but he always made a point of keeping his clothes at his mother 's house as a sign , shall we say , that he was n't totally committed . " " What a perfect scoundrel , " she said laughing . " I hope you never behaved in such a fashion , darling . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That rogue . . . that womanizer . . . " She sputtered to a stop , pretending to be at a loss for words to describe him . " Do n't start me on him . " ' Well , I suspected as much , " Dorothy Clough said with the laugh , and laying aside her embroidery , stood up . " It 's getting late , I had better fetch the children . " She left and Merle , her gaze still on Lyle , her expression one of helpless affection , said softly , " You damn rascal . So tell me , what 's the latest over in Babylon ? " " Big news , man , " he said . " The new development plan is finally ready . It 's to be made public Monday . " " Oh ? " said Saul , turning his way.  | " Yes , I 'm going to send copies to you both . " " So , it 's ready , eh , " Merle said . " All right , tell us the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're a born pessimist . Here you 're ready to condemn the thing before setting eyes on it . But you wo n't be able to find fault with this one because , unlike the last , it 's a good solid plan  --  very sound . You might call it the Great Leap Forward , Bourne Island style . Waterford did a first-rate job . I know you do n't think much of government for bringing him in , but the chap knows his business . " " What 's being stressed in the plan ? " Saul asked . He had left where he had been lounging half-perched , a leg dangling , on the railing across from Harriet and gone to stand near Lyle . " Well , " said Lyle , " as Waterford sees it , and I agree , there are only two ways for us to get into the modern swing of things , so to speak . One is to bring in far more investors than has been done to date , not the big chaps : we 've neither the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones . The other is to expand our tourist trade . We want , we need more of those nice fat dollars you Americans spend so freely when you come down on holiday "  --  he gave the bland smile . " Small industry and tourism then , " he said . " Those two are to take precedence over everything else for the next five to ten years . " " What about agriculture ? " Saul asked . He was frowning slightly , the lines forming a faint wing-shaped pattern above the strong bridge of his nose . " How 's that ? " " How does it figure in the plan ? " " It figures very high , naturally , " Lyle said . " After all , we 're an agriculturalcountry  --  and will be for some time to come . We have n't forgotten that . Any number of changes and improvements are planned . " " Such as ? " Then , as Lyle did n't answer immediately and seemed , moreover , disinclined to go into this , scarcely interested , Saul said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the things that troubles me about so many of the development plans one comes across in places like Bourne Island is that they tend to go all out for industry and tourism  --  to see these as the solution to all problems  --  while agriculture , which is the base of the economy , whatever little lifeblood it has , gets very short shrift indeed . Do n't misunderstand me , " he said . " I appreciate the need to diversify and find other sources of income.  |p205And  I know that under the present setup the options are few . But I 'm also convinced that equal if not greater attention has to be given to agriculture . And there has to be , first , a solid land-reform program  --  it just does n't make any sense , for God 's sake , for Kingsley and Sons to own all the goddamn land in Bournehills except for the little plots belonging to the small farmers ; and , second , an all-out effort to produceas much of your own food as possible . That above all else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place as cramped for space as Bourne Island . Because a country . .. " " My dear Doctor , " Lyle said , interrupting him , " we 're well aware of what you 're saying , and I assure you that all such matters have been taken into consideration in the new plan . In fact , one of the first things being called for is a full-scale investigation of the entire agriculturalpicture with an eye specifically to finding ways of increasing food production . " " We had one of those full-scale investigations ' five years ago , remember ?  --  withthe other so-called development plan and not a damn thing came of it . We 're still importing everything we eat , and it 's killing us . " It was Merle commenting , in a voice that was for her strangely subdued . " Because a country , " Saul repeated , insisting on making his point , " first has to be able to feed itself to some degree before it can think of getting into the modern swing of things as you put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult as that . Merle 's right . It is killing , it 's cripplingfor an island like this to be importing the very basics of life . " " And it would n't even be so bad if the food coming in was at all decent , " said Harriet , speaking for the first time . " But that awful rice and dry , bad-smelling cod which everyone around here eats nearly every day . " " Food fit for a slave , my dear Mrs. Amron ! " Lyle bent on her his chill , sealed smile . It shone very white against his blackness in the rapidly failing light . " Foisted upon us long ago by our metropolitan masters . And still with us to a depressing degree , I admit . You 've named them well . Saltfish , as we call it . The damn , half-rotten rice . The cornmeal that used to be crawling with weevils by the time it reached us when I was a boy . But do you realize that some people up your way made their fortune in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that . . . ? " He waited ; then , as she remained silent , he laughed  --  and in such a way it almost seemed he knew about the faded ledger in the glass display case at the **26;10362;TOOLONG Society and the portrait of the widow in her frilled cap , that whole questionable legacy which Harriet had long ago ruled from her thoughts . " Tell her about that , Merle , " he said . " You 're the historian . Tell her that saltfish , for instance , has been with us for so long on Bourne Island it actually tastes good to us . " " Even I 've gotten to rather like it . " Dorothy Clough suddenly spoke up . She had returned from the beach with her three children , and had paused with them in the doorway to the house , on her way to take them in for their supper and bed . Allen and Vere had left the water by now and gone together into Spiretown to work on the latter 's car . " And the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " There you are , " Lyle exclaimed . " Irrefutable evidence . " Then , turning back to Saul , " But you and Merle are right . We 've got to break the old pattern of depending on the outside for everything we eat . Government knows this . But it also knows it ca n't be done overnight . We 're certain , though , that once we industrialize on a large enough scale we will then have the means to finance the changes needed in agriculture . " " It just does n't work that neatly , Lyle , " he said . " You ca n't do one without the other . " The latter shrugged , ignoring his urgent tone . " Everything 's a gamble , you Americans say . And so , my dear Doctor , " he continued , " even though our approach does n't seem particularly wise to you , we shall be concentrating our efforts in the years ahead on inducing more of the chaps with money up your way to come down and invest it here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , and under the new plan we shall be offering them a number of very attractive incen-tives . " " Such as ? " Merle very quietly asked . She sat drawn deep into her chair , smoking steadily , with the towel wrapped tightly around her . There was the same dead calm in her voice as before . " Yes , " Saul echoed her . " Just how much are you offering them ? " And Lyle , relaxed in his planter 's chair , his face and the details of his body scarcely visible in the nearly completed dusk , told them  --  and his voice in the settling darkness had the same impersonal qualityas his smile , which was still there , they knew , although they could no longer really see it . For one , he informed them , the tax-free period for new businesses was being extended from five to fifteen years , and all customs dutiesp207for them were also being waived for the same period . In addition , the Bourne Island government was planning to build at its own expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived he would find a plant awaiting him  --  and this for only the most nominal rent . ( " How much ? Give us the figure , " Merle said in the dangerously still voice . " Oh , just a token amount , no more than ten or fifteen dollars a year . " His own voice remained unruffled . ) Finally , under the new plan , anyone from abroad setting up a business on Bourne Island would not only be allowed to send all his profits out of the country , but could repatriate his capital in full should the business fail . Saul 's sigh was loud and unhappy in the near-darkness . " You 're certainly giving them a hell of a lot , " he said . " Do n't get me wrong , I know you have to make it an attractive deal for them , if not they 'll take their money elsewhere , but this seems an awfully high price to be paying , given the island 's budget , just to bring in a few small plants which , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't begin to solve the basic problems . " And why give them such a free hand ? " His voice rose ; he stood away from the railing against which he had been leaning . " They should be made to invest in partnership with the government so you 'd at least have some say in their operations as well as a definite share of the profits . It 's your country , after all ! In fact , " he declared , " all such as Kingsley and Sons and the big trading companies and banks along Queen Street should , at the very least , be owned in part by the government . It should demand a controlling interest in them . . . " " Whoa there ! " Lyle stopped him with a laugh . " All that sounds very suspect to me , Doctor . I did n't realize we had a rabid socialist in our midst . You 've been dissembling all along . " " It does n't matter how it sounds . " He spoke sharply . " All I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equitable arrangementis possible . " " And I assure you it is not possible , " Lyle said , and from the sudden Oxonian thrust to the words , they could tell his smile had tightened in a small show of impatience . " I see I had best explain our situation here on Bourne Island to you , apprise you of the realities , so to speak , even though I must say I thought you knew them by now . But it 's clear you do n't . The reality , my dear fellow , is that as far as the world goes we are an insignificant green speck in a relatively small American lake called the Caribbean . Poor . Totally dependent on a single crop that is n't worth a ha'penny anymore on the world market.  |p208Without  any resources except perhaps people , and too damn many of them and nowhere to send them now that England has followed the example of your country and barred her door to the pigs . We 're somewhatindependent , yes . But you and I know that does n't matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cease tomorrow taking our sugar at a preferential price we 'd be finished . How when you Americans can plant a missile-tracking station right on our backsideand there 's nothing we can do about it because the agreement was made long before the present government took office . .. " He uttered his hollow laugh , stretched languorously in the canvas chair , drank from his glass . " It 's indiscreet , I know , to mention such matters , " he said . " And I avoid doing so whenever possible . I usually leave such talk to my good friend Merle here and the one or two like her on the island who still cling to the hope of some impossible revolution . But it 's obvious , Doctor , you need to be reminded of the realities . You know , very often , people like yourself tend to confuse us with the new , large , potentially wealthy countries in Africa and Asia who have a little something to bargain with , even though at the presentthey , too , are at the mercy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the concessions that strike you as excessive . Now as to tourism . . . " And without pausing he went on to speak of the government 's plans there , citing among other things the new extension to the airport , the big promotional campaign planned in the United States and Canada ( " We shall be selling the island as the newest vacationparadisein the Caribbean , " he said in the voice from which some small measure of sarcasm and even rage was never missing , " emphasizingour blue , warm waters , white beaches , palm trees and happy natives , the usual sort of thing . . . " ) and ending with the announcementthat the Hillard Hotel chain , the largest in the world , was interested in having a hotel on the island . " Of course , we might have to agree to them operating a casino in it , " he said . " The Opposition and the church are sure to make a big noise about that , but they 'll come round once we assure them that none of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americangangsters , prostitution , that sort of thing , will be allowed to get started . It 's something of a risk , I suppose , but we ca n't afford to miss out on having one of their hotels here . " " What 's the arrangement ? Who 's to actually build it ? " Saul asked ,  |p209and  a kind of depression had taken hold of his voice . They could sense his shoulders drooping in the darkness . " We are , " Lyle said . " That 's the usual procedure with those big chains in a place like Bourne Island . We 'll build it  --  and yes , it 'll be a strain on the budget , but what to do ?  --  and they will operate it under their name . For a handsome percentage I need n't add . But then that 's business . You could n't very well expect the chaps to come into a place to lose money , could you ? " There was a long silence , broken only by the unintelligible commentof the sea on all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musing aloud to herself , said very quietly , " Signed , sealed and delivered . The whole bloody place . And to the lowest bidder . Who says the auction block is n't still with us ? " The glass she had been drinking from in hand , she slowly and almost painfully stood up . ( Her joints might have grown stiff from sitting in the damp bathing suit . ) Saul heard the intimate sound of the towel being drawn around her body . She must be cold . " Yes , Lord , you fellas in government are all right , " she said in the ominously low voice . " You 're doing a good job . You 're to be congratu-lated . " " Now , now , Merle . . . " Lyle said , and leaning up from his easy chair made to touch her as she started past him toward the door to the house . The hand reaching out to her through the darkness might have acted as a kind of release , because she suddenly snatched away her arm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no Merle ! Do n't let my name cross your lips , damn you ! " And after her long forebodingsilence and the dangerously muted tone she had used when speakingbefore , her anger actually came as something of a relief to the others present . " Signed , sealed and delivered , I say . The whole place . Is that what we threw out the white pack who ruled us for years and put you chaps in office for ? For you to give away the island ? For you to literally pay people to come and make money off us ? Fifteen years without having to pay a penny in taxes ! All their profits out of the island ! A whole factory for ten dollars a year ! Why , man , Bourne Island comes like a freeness to them . And with all the concessions , what ? We do n't see any benefit as such . It 's as Saul said : they do n't get at the real problems like providing enough work for people . Rememberthe plastics factory ? How many did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him in the darkness . " Twenty , " she answered bitterly , " to watch the machines . And over fifty thousandwalking Queen Street every day with nothing to do and getting desperate . Man , it 's a joke . " She swung away in disgust and as quickly spun back . " And now you 're to be giving away even more . Worse , you 're ready to let in every crook and gambler in the hemisphere just to have some big hotel . To turn us into another Bermuda with everybody bowing and scraping for the almighty dollar . Is that all that 's possible for us in these small islands ? Is that the only way we can exist ? Well , if so , it 's no different now than when they were around here selling us for thirty pounds sterling . Not really . Not when you look deep . Consider . The Kingsleys still hold the purse strings and are allowed to do as they damn please , never mind you chaps are supposed to be in charge . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cane field . Come up to Bournehills some day and see him on those hills . Things are no different . The chains are still on . Oh , Lyle , ca n't you see that ? " she cried , and the three on the veranda felt the little rush of air , heard the dull crash of her bracelets in the darkness as her arms went out in appeal to him . " Have n't you fellows in Legco learned anything from all that 's gone on in this island over the past four hundred years ? Read your history , man ! " And then suddenly her voice dropped , and she muttered obscurely to herself , the words unclear , almost inaudible . " And then you wonder why Bournehills is the way it is . Why with all the improvementsyou try out down here it still wo n't change , get into the modernswing of things ' ? Iia ! " She uttered a dark weighted laugh that Saul had occasionally heard from others in the district , and which always left him vaguely disturbed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and speaking almost as if she herself was not conscious of what she was saying , she added , " Bo , you do n't know it , but Bournehillsis the way it is for a reason  --  that you people in town are too blind to see . And it will stay so , no matter what , for a reason . " Just at that moment Dorothy Clough , who had been inside seeing to her children , came out carrying a lighted tilly lamp . Taking one look at Merle poised angrily above Lyle , she hastily went and hung the lamp on its hook on the middle veranda post and sat down without a word . In the sudden harsh light , Merle , the others forgotten , bent overp211the planter 's chair , and her enraged face just inches from Lyle 's , said , whispering it , " But you know , sometimes I do n't recognize you at all . I do n't know the person . Tell me , are you the same Lyle I once knew in England . . . ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she did n't notice . " The same chap who used to say that things in the West Indies had to be completely turned around in order to favor the Little Fella , that any planning had to he done with him in mind , because it was his country and he had to be made to feel part of it ? You used to say that places like Bourne Island needed radical surgery , remember ?  --  that was the expression you always used  --  the old cancer feeding on us cut away , so we could really build something new . You used to . . . " " Dear Merle , " he said , and the calmness of his voice momentarily silenced her . " Dear , dear Merle . You know what your trouble is ? " Ile waited a moment , the eyes that remained veiled , hidden above the broad nose , in the fixed darkness of his face , lifted to her face , holding her to silence . Then : " You refuse to grow old . At your age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you 're still full of all that bogus youthful idealism . And you 'll remain the idealist to the end . Which is one of the reasons I love you , and come down here every so often and let you give me a good tongue-lashing . You make me feel young again , girl , you and the doctor here , talking all that socialist nonsense they used to serve up to us at LSE . But hear me , all your high ideals are quite out of order in the present discussion , as is your emotionalism  --  whichhas always been your worst fault , and I see that I shall have to remind you as I did the doctor of the realities of our situation . . . " " The reality , blast you "  --  her cry jarred the air and caused the lamplight within its enclosure of glass to waver  --  " is that you and others like you have got yours : the big house , the motorcars , the fat jobs , the lot , and it 's to hell with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you realize that ? Do you know the terrible thing that 's happened to us on Bourne Island ? It 's that we live practically one on top the other because the place is so small and yet we do n't see each other , we do n't ever touch . Instead of us pulling together when we need each other so much , it 's every man for his damn self . That 's the reality  --  and the tragedy of us on this island . But I 'm not telling you anything you do n't know . You understand it better than I do . You 're not Deanes or one of those other political hacks down in Legco . But youp212make out you do n't . Oh , God , to know , to understand and to act and live as if you do n't . Man , I would n't want to be you for a day . . . . Then suddenly straightening up , she declared with savage vehemence , " Look , do n't come around here anymore , you hear . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you belong . Finish with you ! " Her hand flew out , banishing him ; and afraid perhaps that she meant it and was really through with him , Lyle quickly sat up and caught her by the wrist . And though he was laughing  --  the mildly chiding , playful laugh he used with her  --  his manner had changed . " Merle , Merle , " he said , and his tone had changed also . " What are you upsetting yourself about ? You 'll just have another one of your attacks . Let 's not quarrel , man . You know as well as I do , even though you 'd never admit it , that there 're no alternatives for us in this place . Not for the time being at any rate . So just relax yourself . Do n't think about it so much . Let 's remember the old days . . . . " And gazing up at her standing over him with the towel wrapped like a great stole or scarf around her , he smiled in an almost tender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember , " he said , " that long red muffler you used to wear all winter long in England ? It was twice as long as you were tall . You would wrap it around and around your neck and face until all anyone could see were your eyes . You were never without it . People said you wore it as a sign of your politics . You would even put the damn thing on in the house sometimes when it was cold . You even slept in it once , remember . . . ? " " What 's all this in aid of ? " Her scream split the air . She tried pulling away . " Not a thing , girl , " he said . His softened gaze remained on her face , his hand around her wrist . And now , like her , he had also forgotten the other three on the veranda . And they , aware of their exclusion , kept silent , their faces turned aside . For the moment all that existed for him , it was clear from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago in England when he and Merle had been lovers  --  a memory which , from time to time , when there were no Dorothy Cloughs and Merle had been alone too long , they renewed  --  but casually , as no more than a gesture in acknowledgment of their long and difficult friendship . " Not a thing , " he repeated . " I know you 've forgotten but I often think of the time we spent together in London . That place , yes ! " he laughed . " All that blasted damp and fog . That miserable flat you hadp213once with the gas heater that never worked when it turned really cold . You used to say the English were the only people who could turn their discomforts into virtues . Remember those parties you used to throw with the money from your rich lady friend in Hampstead who wanted to keep you for herself . They would go on till dawn . Every homesick West Indian student in London would be there . You used to make fishcakes and cook up rice . Man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . But the fight had gone out of her , and she stood , her hand lax in his , caught , ensnared in the trap of memory he had set for her . " Remember that long string of a fellow from Trinidad named Richardson ? He was with me in the RAF . I used to bring him to your parties sometimes . There was nothing Richy loved more than a fete . But he would refuse to listen to all our talk about the coming socialist revolution in the West Indies . He was always telling us not to be so serious about everything and just go on and enjoy ourselves , that life was nasty , brutish and short . Well , his was , I know . He went down in flames over Germany . I saw it with my own eyes ; we were on the same mission . Those Germans shot the plane right out from under him . And remember . . . " But she had broken free of the hold of his voice , and the hand with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . " What 's this in aid of , I ask ! "  --  and again the light in the tilly lamp appeared to dip and recover . The glass hovered just above Lyle 's head . And strangely he looked up at it and smiled . This might have been what he had been hoping for . Something in his expression , his eyes , in the way his body was straining up in the chair , urged her to throw it . He both sought and required her abuse it seemed  --  and not only the customary tongue-lashing she dealt him almost every time he visited Bournehills , but this sharp physical blow as well . It was as if this alone could ease the dull ache of some loss and betrayal of which he was never free . And she must have understood this because the hand with the glass dropped back to her side and her anger collapsed . And standing there , her gaze bent on him , seeing him both as he was now and as the young man who had once shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice that gently reproved him , " Why would you bring up all that ancient history ? Are you looking to lose the only real friend you 've got ? " She turned away then , only to start at the sight of Saul standing across from them at the railing . She had forgotten he was there . Andp214seeing him she involuntarily , for an instant , made to step toward him , and he appeared to start toward her . But neither move was completed , and in what was almost the same moment , she had turned and was heading toward the door of the house , moving slow and heavy-footed , the beach towel trailing on the floorboards . She did not so much as glance at the two women as she passed their chairs ; nor did they look at her . Dorothy Clough , who knew better than to interfere in these periodic clashes between the two , kept her head bent over the embroidery in her lap . From the rapid way she was plying her needle through the linen in the frame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the veranda into the tea roses slowly blooming there . Ilarriet , gazing thoughtfully down at her unfinished letter ( she appeared to be simply thinking of what next to write ) , might have heard none of what had transpired from her expression . And in a way she had n't . Because the moment Merle 's voice had struck the first angry note , a door in her mind had automaticallyslammed shut , closing out the sound . Merle reached the doorway and paused and , her face turned toward the drawing room , said in a voice that struggled to recapture something of her old spirit , " To hell with all of you . To hell with this place . The first real money I lay my hands on I 'm making tracks out of here . Gone ! To the other end of the world . Japan or some damn place . You watch . " Then , staring numbly down at the empty glass in her hand : " I need a drink and a cigarette . And what 's happened to supper ? Carrington ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the level of her despair . " Carrington ! " she repeated and slowly disappeared into the house calling for the old woman.  |p215For  some time afterward Saul found himself puzzling over the scarcely intelligible remark about Bournehills Merle had made during the height of her outburst that evening . It had somehow implied that there were other , more profound , even mystical , reasons for the place being as it was . He tried getting her to explain what she had meant , but with no success . First , immediately following her quarrel with Lyle she had sunk into one of the long , numbing depressions that came over her whenever anything happened to upset her  --  a lingeringsymptom , perhaps , of the breakdown she had suffered years ago in England , and for several days had remained shut in her room in the section of the house that was off limits to everyone but Carrington . Then , when she had emerged and he had asked her about the remark , she had looked sharply at him for a moment , then declared almost irritably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You think I know what I 'm saying half the time ! " and had refused to discuss it . But it continued to occupy his thoughts , mainly because it seemed related to something he had come to feel more and more about the district . Although the research was going well , and he and Allen were accumulating an impressive amount of data , he could not rid himself of the feeling that something about the place was eluding him , some meaning it held which could not be gotten at through the usual methods of analysis . He could not say what made for this impression.  |p216Part  of it , he knew , stemmed from his earlier suspicion that somethingother , and deeper , than the causes he had discovered had made for the failure of the other projects in Bournehills . Part of it also had to do with the strong , other-century feel to life in the district , which though typical of other places he had worked in was more pronouncedhere . Sometimes driving past the old man Mr. Douglin , trimming the grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance of the tiny , seemingly motionless figures of Stinger and the others cutting canes high on a slope ( and why did it always seem to him the same slope ? ) or seeing when he dropped over at Cane Vale the ancient windmill standing intact out in the yard , he would be struck by the feeling , too fleeting to grasp , that he had stumbled upon a world that was real , inescapably real , yet at the same time somehow unreal ; of the present but even more so of the past . He tried putting the thought from his mind . He was letting his imagination get the better of him , he told himself , seeking more in things than was there , trying to make the work harder for himself , and yet he could n't help feeling as the weeks came and went vaguely surrounded by a mystery , and he became increasingly puzzled , even annoyed . Something , goddamn it , he swore to himself , about the place was being withheld , hidden from him . And yet not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the carefully measured smiles people gave him , in the look he occasionally surprised in Delbert 's shrewd , stippled eyes , in the hands raised solemnly in greeting to him along the roads . But whatever it was came and went so swiftly , and was expressed in such obscure terms , it eluded him . He came to think of it as one of those subliminal messages which slip undetected past the eye and ear to fasten like a nettlesome burr on the mind . He considered discussing it with Allen , then thought better of it . The whole thing was too nebulous . Allen , with his scrupulously scientificapproach to everything , who dealt with life in terms of so many charts , graphs and statistical tables ( and it was a valuable asset for someone like himself to have in a research partner ) , would never understand what he was getting at , and would only be made uncomfortableand puzzled . Even Harriet , when he mentioned it to her , musing aloud about it sometimes during the quiet period they spent over coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributed his suspicions to the fact that he was working too hard and suggested they go away for a week or two . To add to matters , this thing he sensed about Bournehills evenp217took on a personal meaning . Because just around that time he found himself recalling events from his own past . Not with any regularity , but often enough to start him questioning . Walking along the roads he sometimes had the impression he was wandering back over the paths his life had taken . Incidents from his childhood and youth , from his early field-work experiences in Mexico and Peru , from the war , where he had served in Europe , and the journey he had felt compelled to make afterward to see for himself the death camps in Poland ; memories from his first marriage and his long uneven career  --  all these , fragments from the past , had suddenly for no reason begun to surface to his mind like flotsam from a submerged wreck . And faces from the past began to accost him along the roads , rising out of the shimmering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marl dust stirred up by his shoes . Faces of his family : his mother 's the day he had clapped his hands over his ears , refusing to listen anymore to that wildly imagined tale of her family 's ancient flight and suffering ; his father 's the time when , in his youthful arrogance , he had scornfully rejected the old man 's ambitions for him and declared he would go his own way . He had wronged them both . At times he again saw the senile Jehovah in the upstairs window , he of the tobacco-stained beard and soiled tallith who had daily atoned for the sins of the world . Once , the eyes of the young German soldier he had shot point-blank stood blue and terrified before him , hanging there disembodied in the air ; another time he saw with startling clarity the face of the first woman he had ever truly loved . She had been Peruvian  --  a public health nurse as well as a strong nationalist even back then , who had at first questioned and even resented his presence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begged him to stay on , join their fight , marry her . .. . Remembering her face the day he told her his research was done and he would be leaving , the disappointment , sadness and scorn reflected there , he had to stop and pass his hand over his eyes to clear away the memory . And other faces rose to haunt him as well , as he made his way around Bournehills : the white ones of his colleagues who had condemned what they felt to be the reformer in him , the dark ones of the people among whom he had worked , whose eyes , especially those of the children , reminded him of how abysmally he had failed in his grand designs for them . Moreover , as the weeks passed , all the faces began to merge , flowingone into another to form one face : that of his first wife ; and **25;10390;TOOLONG crowd , he liked to think , being clever and mobile enough . He was spending his adolescence in the faint shadows of actual gangsters , or the friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , derelict , glamorous style of their living . He took some of his language from them or from their imitators or from movies , and his clothes and even his walk had a slightly retarded , lounging , lethargic , contemptuous , self-conscious air about them , a pimp 's style ; he was very pleased with all this . He said to his grandmother , " Pa could n't take off from work . He had two sick days last month . " " What about her ? " " I can take you as well as her , ca n't I ? You said you liked to ride the bus . You want a cigarette or something ? " Her husband had died of cancer of the throat , and during this lingering death of all times she had begun to smoke . She astonishedeveryone . She carried on with Jules a man-to-man , boy-toboy , brotherly , childish camaraderie , conspiratorial and pointless to Jules but , he supposed , a means for her to take revenge on that middle generation she believed had wronged her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smirk , as if they were both putting something over on Loretta , she accepted a cigarette . Jules was saddened to see his grandmother such a lumpy woman in her dark , long , shapeless coat and her pushed-down hat of some indecipherable style , with a torn veil and dark brown wings of feathers . What an old woman she 'd become ! Better for her to have been transformed into an old man ! She complained about that bastard , the Mayor , and that other bastard , the Governor , and most of all that bastard who was President of the United States . Taxes , too many taxes . Social Security was a racket , a joke . They were playing a joke on her . If she was n't an old woman she would fight . The United States was crazy , she could tell from the newspaper , and Europe was crazy , a loss . " All of the world is a garbage dump , " she said . On Fort Street a steady stream of cars and trucks passed . The river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes took in the heavy , unbeautiful span of the Ambassador Bridge , the bridge to Canada , a sight he 'd lived under for many years . He wondered what was the way out , which direction he should take . Though his grandmother mouthed sourly these complaints , it was too late for her : she could never escape.  | " All my life I lived around men , " the old woman was saying angrily . " I know men . Women I do n't know . Women I do n't talk to . You 're better letting them alone . You are a man yourself , at your age , you got common sense , I can talk to you . Right ? But your mother . .. " So it was about his mother again . Jules said evasively , " Oh , let Ma alone . " " Does she let me alone ? Does she ever let me forget whose house I 'm living in ? I just ask you that , I put it to your common sense . ' Pell the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know . " " A crazy house , wide open like that . People coming and going , those friends of hers , them , those women got nothing better to do than drag their asses around in a bathrobe and drink beer all afternoon , playing rummy all the time . It 's no wonder Howard stays out late , I do n't blame him . And your sister Betty is going to go bad  --  " " That 's her business . " " Your sister Maureen is too skinny . " " She 's okay . " The old woman sucked at her cigarette . Jules observed from the corners of his eyes that she did not know how to smoke with any grace . " My boy Samson has sure turned against me , " she said , latching onto another favorite topic . When Jules did not reply she said confidentially , " He 's the one with the brains . He 's got them . Poor Howard was standing behind a door or something when the brains were handed out . When Samson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd be fooling around with fixing things . Like the car , the toaster , stuff like that , the oven , wires and stuff . Now he 's got in good at Ford 's , and it 's a big celebration for me to come over , his wife thinks I should kiss her big feet or something , but I sit there in the chair and look around and I do n't say much . I 'm thinking plenty though . She can tell what I 'm thinking about her . But I never ask them for anything  --  they can wait till hell freezes over before I ask them for a dime , them with all their money . Any day they wanted to they could take me in . They have a room in the upstairs . I 'm no trouble , I can cook for myself , but no , nothing . Let me stay with Howard , let me stay with your parents who got troubles of their own and a dump on Twentieth Street thrown in . No , I 'm just talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get mep102wrong . . . " And on and on in her jocular , angry , whining monologue , while Jules held himself protected against her bitter insults , his eyes fixed upon the smoggy distance . She said , " That kid of theirs born with the bad ear  --  that serves them right , her with her snotty face and those cut-glass plates and crap she thinks so much of ! " Loretta had had a baby with a bad heart a few years before ; it had been a boy , had died at eighteen months . " All right , Grandma , " Jules said . " People get what they deserve . You 'll see . " " All right , please . " " Well , I 'm not doing it ! I 'm not the one ! God will take vengeancein His own time . I 'm not passing judgment or waiting for anything , " she said hatefully . Jules saw the bus on its way . Relief . Gratitude . He guided the old woman up the steps and down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than once already , hard , and it had been Jules 's task to get her home again . No light-boned old woman was his grandmother , but a leaden , lumpy old man whose very muscles seemed to work spasmodically against her . The bus smelled of exhaustand sweat . Jules sat beside his grandmother , but half out in the aisle to give her room , and gave himself up to the ride . SomedayI will change all this , he thought with a flash of joy . He thought of a wilderness , land out West ; a golden sky , or perhaps a golden field of wheat . . . mountains . . . rivers .. . something unmapped . The bus went slowly . Stops and starts . Jules 's eyes took in the other passengers and saw no one interesting ; he 'd seen them all before . He fixed his attention finally upon one woman , a fairly pretty woman . He liked women . He felt his pulse quicken at the sight of a woman of some charm , and he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes , a tugging of a skirt . Having lived so close to his mother for so many years , yet at a certain intelligent distance from her , he understood the bewildermentof women in Detroit . They were bewildered , confused , fearful . He dreamed of offering his brains to them , putting himself in their service , helping them through a bus ride or across a street or when their husbands came home drunk . A woman in a laundromatp103in Detroit only appears to be in control of the machines ! A woman in a car only appears to be in control ! Inside , her machinery is as wobbly and nervous as the machinery of her car , which may have been slammed together by someone as mutely angry as Jules 's father , now on the assembly line at Chrysler . Jules began to smile , thinking of women . Through his mother 's pale puffiness he could see a pretty face  --  he did n't need to be reminded by the snapshots she loved to pass around  --  and though her legs were clumsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before her motherin-lawand the baby with the bad heart and Howard 's nightly snoring , which kept Jules awake many hours and raised his hatred to a passionate height . His sister Maureen had a delicate , intelligent beauty that pleased him ; she was his sister , and on the street he took pride in defending her . In Betty he had less interest . She was tough and quick and could take care of herself . " Why do you think Betty will go bad ? " he asked his grandmother . ' When he was least prepared for it he gave in to her : there was something in him , as there was in his mother , that leaned toward the old woman with pained and fearful expectation . The clinic was a new , cheap building , only one story high , with a parking lot surrounded by a fence that seemed to be made of bright brown cardboard but was probably made of wood . Jules guided his grandmother inside . Already exhausted , she sank into a chair spitefully ; Jules had to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . Detroit people  --  Polish mothers , Polish children , old men out of work , middle-aged men out of work , welfareslobs , the sick , the dying , the prematurely gray and the prematurelywasted , all of them sitting staring at one another with gaunt , suspicious eyes . The whites stared at the whites and at the Negroes ; the Negroes stared at other Negroes and at the whites . Whenever someone came in the front door everyone looked at him with a kind of hope and then registered disappointment ; it was mysterious , this ritual . A few patients came out of the inner part of the building and seemed to be finished for the day . They put on their coats in that humble , resigned way of people on charity , halfway out the door as the left sleeve is conquered , head bowed , eyes spiteful and apprehensive.  |p104Jules  nearly fell asleep standing , the fluorescent lighting was so hypnotic , the odor of unwashed bodies so oppressive and yet so narcotic ; he thought dreamily of the girl in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life he would break into when he got out of school and was on his own , finally , a man , leading a life that involved raising his family and then getting out from under them . First he would raise them to be like other people . Then he would get out from under them . I will change my life in the end , he thought . He would go to California . They waited . The first hour passed slowly . Some skinny children played in the waiting-room . They knocked over an ashtray . Their mother , a very thin , angry woman , slapped their faces and forgot them . The receptionist leaned over her counter and said in a courteousbut sharp voice , " Please keep those children quiet . " They were quiet for a while , sullen and weary , then their legs began to twitch and they were up again , fooling around . A man with a tremblinghead said suddenly , loudly , " I been waiting here since nine o'clock ! They told me come at nine o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The receptionist stared at him . She was a youngish woman with a severe , lined face . " What is your name , please ? Come up to the desk , please , " she said . The man did not seem to hear . Ile had a beery red face and an enlarged nose , all pores and blackheads . Ile said to Jules 's grandmother , seeing some kinship in her impatient scowl , " They give you pills with flour in them here . This place , they give you air bubbles in the blood so you die . It 's free . " Jules 's grandmother , always unpredictable , snubbed the man . The second hour passed into the third hour . Jules was still standing , too weary to try for a seat . The children were still playing , wandering from one side of the room to the other ; other children had joined them . A Negro boy of about five cringed behind his mother 's thigh , watching the white children . He sucked noisily at his thumb . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he helped her into the consulting room , embarrassed at her clumsiness . He never knew whether she was exaggerating pain or suppressing it . When he got back , her seat had been taken by a fat woman , so he remained standing . A strange , cool patience entered him . He picked up ap105copy of the Saturday Evening Post and read an article on football . lie read it carefully , as if he were reading about something from another planet : but to know anything was valuable . He had no interest in sports . All that energy expended among boys , for a trivialgoal with no profit , seemed to him foolish , but still some people took it seriously  --  why did they take it seriously ? He picked up an issue of the National Geographic with thumbprints of blood on its cover . Its photographs fascinated him , tugging at his eyes as if toexclaim , Look , look at this , look at this skyline , look at this formation of rock , look at this African chieftain , look , why are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and leafed through a copy of Time . He read about the Negroes of America  --  " A Decade of Prosperity "  --  the achievement of equality , of justice , affluence in Harlem ; he read the cover story , about a man from India named VinobaBhave . " I have come to loot you with love , " said this man . Jules read , fascinated : " We are all members of a single human family . " Vinoba Bhave read only three books , Euclid 's Elements , Aesop 's Fables , the Bhagavad Gita . Jules grew excited ; he too would read these books . He would get hold of them the next day . Vinoba Bhave said , " My object is to transform the whole of society . Fire merely burns . . . Fire burns and does its duty . It is for others to do theirs . " These words stayed in his mind , in spite of the fat lady 's sniffing . " Fire burns and does its duty . " What he would like , Jules thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live a secular life parallel to a sacred life  --  a modern life , at all costs  --  to expand Jules out to the limits of his skin and the range of his eyesight . He could do it . He needed only time and some space to move around in . Fire burns and does its duty . . . He could believe in fire and in himself . He too would do his duty . In the United States of America complicated maps are given away at any filling station , just ask for one , all that valuable information given away for nothing  --  about this world there is much information , mountains of facts and wonders , but about the other world there is nothing , and so Jules detached himself from it without regret . He believed in himself . He did not trust anyone else . Expelled from the nuns ' school for beating up some little Italian bastard , he 'd also been kicked out of the routine ofp106helping to serve Mass during the week . All that was ended . Anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not cry . They got angry but they did not cry . He missed only the long dark skirts and sleeves and nervous rosaries of the nuns , those sexless but very female females , dour and goodhearted but easily stirred to white-eyed violence . . . every one of them a mother to him , ready to be adored like the Virgin Mary , no matter if her breath was a little sour and some dark hairs jutted out of her jaw , no matter . He did miss them . But he did not miss the church , the early Mass , the pictures of Jesus as an adult and as a baby , glorified , bleeding , dying , dead , or risen again , in an ecstasy of power . He had not liked Jesus . He had resented the nuns ' interest in Him . He , Jules , would be a better man , or at least a cleverer man  --  why not all the kingdomsof the earth ? Why not ? The kingdoms of the earth would only go to someone else ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still gone . New people had come in , standing back against the wall ; they did not even think to unbutton their coats . Jules tried not to think of his grandmotherstruggling in some back room , fighting a losing battle with some nurse . What terror in the grime of his grandmother 's underclothingand the secrets of her once-female life ! Every time she came to the clinic there was a battle . They lost her records , or could n't find them ; her doctor was out having coffee ; there was a draft from a window ; an impatient nurse snapped that most patientswashed themselves before coming to the clinic . . . The old woman would come out swearing . Too loud , bustling and clumsy and loud in the waiting-room , letting everyone know that she , she was not going to stand for this treatment . After another long hour she appeared . A nurse was beside her , helping her along . Jules went to her at once and extracted the prescription slips from her fingers . He saw by her face that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat , got her outside and down to the corner and waiting for another bus . Another bus . Detroit . Afternoon . He was spending too much of his life , Jules thought , waiting for buses . His grandmother was silent . Her big , doughy , ugly face was turned away . Jules said lightly , " They sure make you wait in that goddam place ! "  |p107His  grandmother nodded . " Which doctor did you get this time ? " " I do n't know . " " Do n't know ? Was it the same one , the guy with the glasses ? " She shrugged her shoulders . " I thought you liked him . Do n't you know who took care of you ? " " How do I know ? " she snapped . " I should know , me ? I should know anything that goes on ? I 'm an old woman , the world is shit to me , shut up about it ! You with your pointed shoes and tight pants , shut up ! " Suddenly he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he got her back home again . They lived in a two-family house on a sleazy , comfortable little street , with a lot of dogs and children in the neighborhood . Mexicanslived not three blocks away , but they were not like Negroes . No one was home but Loretta , who was taking pins out of her hair at the kitchen table . She looked guiltily and cheerfully at Grandma Wendall . She said , " Well ? " " Well what ? " said Grandma Wendall . She took off her ugly hat and stood with it in her hand . " How are you ? What did they say ? " " He 's got the thing for the pills . " " What did they say ? " " Who knows what they said ? " " Did you tell them about the blood ? " The old woman smiled at Loretta contemptuously . " You do n't need to ask what I tell them , what I do n't tell them . Whose business ? I tell them what comes to mind . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's business is it ? " Loretta rubbed her hands across her face . " All right . When do you have to go back ? " " Four days . " " Four days ! " Grandma Wendall went into her room . Loretta took her hands away from her eyes like a little girl and looked at Jules . Jules tried to smile , then smiled  | " She passes blood , " Loretta said . " I bet she did n't tell them . She always keeps something back . She has secrets nobody gives a damn about . " " Why would n't she tell them ? " said Jules . " She wants to get well . " " Dying people do n't want to get well , " Loretta said . Jules got away from her . He went to the bathroom and slicked his hair back and went out to his job , which was at a liquor store . He helped load up the delivery truck and rode along in it ; he was aching for the day when he could drive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleeding , bleeding into the toilet bowl , her face shut up with secrets and pain , and he kept thinking of that Indian , whose name he could not quite remember . We are all members of a single human family . He wondered if that was true . His mind kept turning and turning upon it , fascinated . The liquor store was down on Fort Street . Deliveries were made all the way out to Grosse Pointe , and though he was n't paid much he liked the expensive look of the bottles and their fancy titles ; he liked being around success ; he liked riding in the truck and unloadingliquor at the service entrances of big houses . He tried to put the thought of his grandmother out of his mind  --  that old woman with seeping , leaking insides and a heart spiced with poison  --  but it was no better to think of the next day , school the next day , homework due he would n't have time for . Instead he thought of an older Jules , a successful Jules . Grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered about the form in which success would come to him  --  nothing as obvious as liquor , owning a liquor store , nothing so common . He worked until after six , then cut off for home through back alleys . He was exhausted . But a kind of rapture came to him in the darkening , wet , foggy air that concealed him so well and gave to him only vaguely the forms of automobiles and trucks and other people . At such times it occurred to him that he might pass unseen through the city , knowing its back alleys and knowing how to turn invisible ; he thought of himself as a character in a book being writtenby himself , a fictional fifteen-year-old with the capacity to becomeanything , because he was fiction . What could n't he make out of himself ? Every night his mother whined about money , everyp109night his father sat silent and smoldering , a man without money , every night Grandma Wendall spoke in sour jabs about someone with brains who had made it to the top  --  that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly about money , making money , doing somebody out of money ; he talked about his brother who had a used-car lot and sold junkers to people who did n't know any better and who could n't read at all , let alone read about interest rates  --  Polacks , niggers , spies , Mexicans , all of them there for the taking , to be taken . Again and again , taken . But Jules could not keep his mind fixed on money . If he was a character in a book of his own making , why should money hold him back ? He would get it and would float upon it . First he would buoy up his family and slide out from under them , agile and shrewd , and float out and away upon the ocean of America , all the way across the Midwestern prairies and the Rockies to the West Coast , where the future of America lay , waiting for people like him . He could change his name . He could change his looks in five minutes . He could change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He gave in to such fantasies as if physical weakness opened doors in his mind , and in the drab , dangerousminutes after his father came home and before supper was put on the table he sat loafing by the radio , lost in a dream , pale and slouching . Was n't he half Alan Ladd in Shane , was n't he half Marlon Brando ? But he mixed up with the people in the clinic , the fat lady and the man with the trembling head and the noisy kids . He 'd been there . He was one of them . He heard the news about Korea  --  " hope for truce . " Well , good . Doors kept opening and closing in his mind . He got the second section of the newspaper and skimmed through it . One item caught his attention : a nineteen-year-oldTexan who had been given $19,000 by a rancher . Given $19,000 . The two of them had become friends in a Texas jail , where the rancher was serving a life sentence for killing his wife . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy had married a ninth-grade girl and bought an expensive car and was on his way , going straight . . . He did n't want $19,000 , Jules thought bitterly . He wanted a wilderness , a clearing in the wilderness , something like that old farm of his childhood where another Grandma Wendall had lived . P110Nearby , his father sat drinking ale from the bottle . His father 's blue shirt was stained with perspiration . His hair had become thin , but irregularly thin ; his forehead was lined ; he seemed to be turning into a version of his own mother . This man shut every door in Jules 's mind . He could remember nothing , not even the newspaper story . Seeing Jules look at him , his father said suddenly , " You still hang around with that Malone kid ? " " Why ? " " What about that other one , what 's his name , that little bastard with the pop-eyes , that little bastard ? " his father said . Jules pretended to be thinking . " You mean Roszak . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the parlor from the kitchen . She sat down on the arm of the sofa , wriggling her dirty toes , leaning over toward Jules . " In jail where ? " said Jules , though he knew this was true . " A wonder you 're not in with him , " Betty said . " I 'm no friend of his , " said Jules . He felt his scalp prickle , knowinghe was close to trouble , but for some reason his father let this pass . Betty grinned at Jules . " Ramie Malone is going to be busted too . ' That smart-ass ! " " What do you know about it ? " Jules said . " I know plenty . " She was a dumpy little girl , eleven years old . There was somethingtoughly precocious about her as if she were really not eleven but twenty , or thirty , or forty , dwarfed but pleased with herself . Jules frequently saw such people in Detroit  --  usually men , with small quick steps , a darting manner , self-conscious , gawky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loretta 's looks were half submerged in Betty 's face , features that should have been pretty but were blunted , the lips too thick , the nose too thick , as if Loretta and Howard had gotten together in drunken fun and fashioned a face out of clay , each fighting to get his own looks represented . She led a gang of kids , girls her own age and a few younger boys , who fooled around on the street and made trouble in a small way . Their father sat across from them , silent again . He must have been thinking of something else , not hearing them . What did theirp111father think of ? Of his job ? Of his sick , stinking mother ? Of her Social Security pension ? Of the car breaking down again ? Of the rent on this dump of a house ? On the niggers moving in a few blocks away ? Of his wife 's sullen padding in bedroom slippers out in the kitchen ? Of supper , pork chops frying in a pan ? What did he think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the hope for a truce in Korea , and if the UAW wanted more sick-pay benefits and retirement benefits he was not thinking about that , because why should he ? Nor was he thinking of his daughter egginghim on to give his son a good slap across the face , which the son deserved ; nor was he thinking of the bell-bottomed green lamp on the table beside him , nor of the Detroit News half read on the floor , nor of the radiator with its fake wood top and its row of little glass birds , nor of the silhouette picture on the wall of a gracious lady with a superior nose , one of Loretta 's touches , nor of the grimy , ripped red slipcover on the sofa , nor of Jules 's rotting sneakersand Betty 's rotting teeth . . . Under the glass of the coffee table were snapshots of the family . Everyone was there . Jules was there as a baby , as a pouty young kid , as a skinny twelve-year-old ; Betty and Maureen were there , Betty as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was there in one bright hectic color snapshot , dressed in yellow , a canary-colored hat on her head , holding a baby in her arms , maybe the one who had died ; and Grandma Wendall was there , sure enough , looking like a self-righteous tank in a navy-blue dress , decked out for Sunday ; even Howard was there , minus his paunch , in a dim photograph , in disguise as a soldier . Jules felt his mind mist over . What were all these people and things doing together , what were they doing to him ? A few weeks before , cruising around the neighborhood with Ramie and some other kids , Jules had seen his father and mother leaving a grill that had a bowling alley attached to it , and in the beery neon light the two of them had looked very . . . very married , very much together , deep in a conversation interrupted by Howard 's barking laugh and Loretta 's girlish wrist-shaking , a gesture that said , Hey , is n't that something ? It shocked Jules to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They themselves were not aware of it , and it was a shame he could n't draw Loretta aside and say to her , " Well , it must not be too bad , why the hellp112are you always complaining about him ? I mean , I saw the two of you laughing together one night out on the street , the two of you . .. " Maureen came to get them for supper . He was hungry but he went out with dread . Anything might happen out here in the kitchen . What he must do is concentrate on getting through it and out to his night-time job . Right . He sat between Maureen and his father , his usual place . Shakily he thought of the future : that night , and the next day , and the real future . The future was important , not the present . These minutes spent around the supper table , these ten or fifteen minutes he had to get through , were not important except as they were part of a process leading to the future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt sure . He began to dish out food for himself . His fatherleaned over his plate and cut a piece of meat with the edge of his fork . Betty jiggled the table . Maureen let one hand fall sadly on the edge of the table , just for a moment . Loretta leaned against the table so that her heavy breasts inside her dress were outlined . It was irritating and painful for ; them to have to think of Grandma Wendall , because she had n't come out . " Where 's the old lady ? " said I-Ioward . " Laying clown , " said Loretta . " She sick again ? " " Oh , something hurts . Her gall bladder . " Betty reached for a piece of bread . Her left arm was scarred faintly from the wrist to the elbow ; some drunken mother of a friend of hers had thrown a hot iron at her , claiming that Betty was beating up her daughter , but Betty had claimed that they were all crazy there and that the old lady had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the iron right at her . Jules stopped thinking about Betty . He thought of the night-time streets , which excited him , and of the girl he loved in school , a daytime girl who had no eyes for him and was faintly embarrassed by his attention . He himself had a girl , a girl with thick black hair who tagged along with him in school . . . " Did you find that punchboard ? " Maureen said to Betty . " I lost it . " " How 'd you lose it ? "  | " At school . " " Is that something I have to pay for ? " Loretta said . " I 'm gon na tell Sister I lost it . " " Maybe somebody stole it , " said Maureen . " Sure somebody stole it . " " You probably stole it yourself , you , " Loretta said knowingly but without interest . The subject passed . Maureen looked around the table with her hazy green eyes , a quiet girl with slender arms and a slender neck ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old and in eighth grade at the nuns ' school . She looked back at Betty . " Did you steal it ? " she said . Betty made a face . " How sick is Grandma ? " Maureen said . " She 's okay . " " She gon na die ? " said Betty . " Shut up , " said Loretta . " Yeah , you tell me to shut up , you tell me I stole that punchboardthat cost forty cents , " Betty cried . " I 'm spost to sit here andshut up ? " IlI " Shut your mouth , I mean it , " Loretta said . 11 , " Shut your own mouth ! " Betty said . They ate . Jules looked at the center of the table where the salt and pepper shakers were parted . His fingers ached to bring them side by side , together . Was something going to happen ? Would tonight be the night he 'd grab the butcher knife and let his old man have it ? Right in that fat gut ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead lightly coated with sweat , if he did that , then he 'd be ending everything too soon . Too soon . Fifteen years old , that was too soon to end it . Had n't the nuns and his mother and grandmother and even a few cops promisedhim he would n't live past twenty , which meant he would live at least until he was twenty ? Twenty years of age was a distant , monstrous goal ; he 'd never make it . A vast , wild , undesired desert , twenty years of age , and he would feel no grief at dying . But fifteen was young.  | " Ethel is going to work in a beauty parlor , " Loretta said . Howard said nothing . " We went to a movie today . She won a free plate  --  she 's got all the luck . I got nothing . " " I did n't steal that punchboard , " Betty said . " Somebody stole it from me . " " I said shut up about that . " " Well , nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rodent-like , frightened look and he figured that she had stolen it , whatever it was ; she 'd been caught stealing things in the past and she always denied it . Denied everything . That was her style , stupid and flat-footed , denying what was obvious . " A lot of kids take things at school , " Maureen said . " Sister Mary Margaret went in the cloakroom today and said she found something in somebody 's coat pocket that was n't supposed to be there , and those people had better return the things , but she would n't say who it was . She was real mad . Nobody did anything . She went around the room asking who took her calendar , it was a little calendarup on her desk , and she asked everybody one by one but they said they did n't know . I was scared when she came to me . She said , Maureen , you know , do n't you ? ' I said no . I had my fingers crossed and my toes crossed . " " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Floyd or maybe Anna Cruise , I do n't know . I do n't hang around with those dopes . " " What 'd they do with it ? " " Threw it out , somebody said . " Loretta looked up suddenly . " Is that her making that noise ? The old woman ? " No one had heard anything . Maureen said , " I 'll go look . " " You sit still , " said Howard . " This is supper . " Jules stared at the table for a few seconds and then brought the salt and pepper shakers together . They made sense together . " She needs more pills , " Loretta said . Howard , eating , did n't look up . " I said she needs more pills . "  | " All right . " " Well , your brother Samson said he 'd give her twenty dollars a week , and she told him to go to hell , now what do you expect ? We got to buy all them pills . " Howard did n't answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Last year it was something else , then they took all the goddam tests over again and it was something new . . . " Howard pushed his plate away from him toward the center of the table . He had big beefy hands . Jules looked at those hands and saw the pale half-moons of the nails , a surprising sight . Loretta said angrily , " When she drops dead your brother and his wife will send flowers . Have some Masses said . Connie will come up here by Greyhound and have another baby right in the front room . She 'll want to stay here so I can wait on her . Your goddam family will all move in sooner or later . Let them . " Howard looked at her . " What are you talking about ? " he said . " If Connie comes up to Detroit  --  " " Is she coming ? " " Your mother says maybe . " Howard appeared to be listening but said nothing . Loretta said , leaning forward against the table . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got Maureen moping around here . I do n't want two of them moping around ! " " I 'm not moping around , " Maureen said , surprised . " I 'm not taking anybody else in ! I take care of her now and for what ? For nothing ! She told your goddam brother to go to hell with his money and now what ? Now what ? I can clean up after her ! Sure ! And she said herself that your brother said he would n't give that hundred dollars to you that time because you 'd spend it on yourself  --  that 's what your brother thinks of you ! " " She made that up . " " No . No , absolutely no , your mother does not make anything up but always tells the truth , just ask her . Everything she says is absolutelythe truth , that 's why we keep her around here . " " All right , " Howard said . " All right yourself . " " How sick is she ? " Betty said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loretta cried . Howard stood suddenly . He stared down at his hands . " You want your face pushed in ? " he said in a strangled , quiet voice . Loretta jumped back from the table . " You try it ! You , you goddambig sow , you pig , you stinking mama 's baby pig ! " she screamed . Maureen put her hands over her head . Betty cringed away . Jules got ready to escape . Their father headed for the back door , stumbling . He had a quiet , dense , obscure look to him , even to his back ; they could hear him muttering to himself . Betty put her fist into her mouth to keep from laughing . " Good-by ! Good night ! Sleep tight out in the alley with the rats ! You know where you belong ! Bastard ! Mama 's baby bastard ! " Lorettacried . She had a dazzled , alert look about her . Her jaw seemed to flash toughly , and then she moved about the kitchen , flowing about it , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's true and he knows it , everybody knows it , when that old sow dies he 'll squeal like a little pig , everybody knows it , am I telling some news ? Jesus Christ , but I 'm sick of this ! " She picked up his bottle of ale and took a drink from it . " Grandma can hear you , " Maureen said . " She has ears , let her hear . " Loretta sat down in Howard 's chair . " So he has a tool-and-die thing of his own , a factory , he 's setting himself up in business . Your uncle . Uncle Samson . So he 's going to make money and his wife can spit in my eye , and your father will stand for it all because he 's a goddam stupid ass-hole and all he can do is push me around but he ca n't make any money himself becausehe 's a goddam stupid ass-hole .

Who got kicked out of the nuns ' school for fooling around , huh ? You 'll end up like your father , you think you 're so smart . " " I 'm not ending up like him or anybody else . " " Down in the morgue before you 're twenty ! " She pushed Howard'splate a little farther away from her . She took out a pack of cigarettes and lit one . Her face was smooth and high-colored.  |p117Jules  went back to eating , feeling somehow pleased . After a moment Betty said , " What movie did you see today , Ma ? " " Oh , it was real nice , I liked it fine , " Loretta said . She always began this way when talking about movies . " What was it about ? " " It was real nice . It had a kind of complicated plot , you did n't know at first what was going on . You want me to tell you ? There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , and the butler and the maids are working hard . The butler is real handsome , he 's making sure everything is just right , he puts out a fire some stupid rich old guy sets by mistake with his cigar , and a rich old bitch gets locked in the bathroom and he unscrews the door to let her out  --  that was real funny . Well , the story is about this butler and the maids , they 're real cute , and the chauffeur and the gardener and some other people that work here  --  it takes place in Philadelphia , the family is very wealthy but they 're really bankrupt but do n't know it yet . The old man is in the stock market . He has a daughter and a son and a crazy wife , a real funny old rich gal with wigs and stuff  --  she does card tricks and plays the harp , she 's just great , she loans her wigs to the maids and everything . Well , the butler gets the Wall Street Journal every morning before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on in the stock market , and he finds out in a headline that the family is bankrupt . But he does n't want to tell them because the old guy has a heart condition , and also the daughter is going to get married to some French banker . And the movie is about how the butler gets the other servants to fool the family . They have a big ball for the daughter 's engagement and everything , and all the stuff is borrowed or stolen from differentplaces , like florists and diamond stores and restaurants and stuff . Funny , it was so funny ! " " What happened in the end ? " Jules said patiently . " Oh , the stock market goes back up . The daughter gets married . The butler marries one of the maids , there are two of them after him throughout the whole show . It ends all right , " Loretta said . " I wish I could see it , " said Betty . " Find that punchboard , kid , and you 're on your way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Forget it . Forget it . " Loretta crushed out her cigarette in ap118plateful of mashed potatoes . " Look , kid , I got a headache from your lazy bastard of a father . And that old woman gets next to me , I mean she gives me a pain where a pill wo n't reach . You little pests think you 're so special but you do n't know nothing ! You , Jules , you look so goddam smart-aleck but you do n't know nothing ! I was n't always this low . The two of them bring me down low . I could lay on the sidewalk out front and croak , that 's how low they get me , but I was n't always like this . There was a man who got killed because of me , shot right in the head , shot dead , and it happenedbecause of me , and nobody 's ever going to get shot in the head for you , Reeny kid , with your sour puss and your gawky neck , and you , Betty , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have babies . I was n't always like this , and when I get rid of that old bitch I 'm going back to work again , with Ethel . I 'm getting out from under all of you and your smart-aleck mouths and all the food you eat up . Christ ! I 'm sick of all this . I want to be like people in that movie , I want to know what I 'm doing , I do n't want to be shoved this way and then that way . Now , if we got to move out of this house like somebody was saying , if they want to fix the street  --  now , now that 's what drives me crazy . Listen , Jules , it drives me crazy the way I always have to move from one place to another . You remember out in the country ? Then we came to Detroit ? Then all them dumps , them bus rides ? I ca n't stand always moving around ! I want my own place , my own house . I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get dressed up and walk down the street and know something important will happen , like this man who was killed because of me  --  like that  --  and on my deathbed , Jules kid , I 'll tell you a secret about him and shake you up , just wait . I was n't meant to be like this  --  I mean , stuck here . Really I was n't . I do n't look like this . I mean , my hair , and I 'm too fat . I do n't really look like this , I look a different way . And the toilet is bad again , there 's water on the floor , well , I ca n't give a goddam about that , I was n't born to mop up every toilet in the city or take care of some old bat that should have dropped dead twenty years ago . Or have him climb on top of me , that fat bastard ! No , listen , I really was n't and I 'm not drunk now and you know it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm saying what I feel . You think you 're all special , all people who are born think they 're special , butp119you 're no more special than me . I know who I am  --  I got a lot of things to do and places to see and this is n't all there is in the world ! Not this ! Not for me ! " Jules had momentum enough to get him all the way to Tenth Street before he tried for a ride . He walked backward in the street , his thumb in the air . Cars passed close to him , very close , but the drivers did not appear to see him ; Jules , with a look of cool anxiety , appeared not to see them either . Car after car passed him . His eyes began to water in the early spring wind that swept off the river . There was an odor of metal and smoke in the air , a wet taste to it . In the middle of a scrubby block of buildings and vacant lots he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him all the way downtown , to the parking lot where he worked . He worked for fifty cents an hour , helping out the attendant in the busy hours between seven and two in the morning , when people in marvelous cars came to entrust them to Jules or to the sunken-necked attendant , a man named Rich who was maybe thirty or forty . The smell of such cars ' insides stirred Jules 's lust in a mystical way , and the smell of ladies ' perfume , sometimes lingering with the cold leather or borne lightly on the air as they passed in their furs and immaculate hairdos , made his brain burst into fragments of wild hope . Such cars ! Such women ! Such men , in their excellent coats and gloves , their shoes excellent , their faces cleanly shaved and their hair newly cut , everything perfect . These people were headed for two or three good restaurants nearby , or across the way to the Sheraton-Cadillac , where things were going on not just on Saturday nights but forever , endlessly . Jules , shivering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars into place with great reverence for their beauty and never nicked a bumper or a fender ; he believed he had a magic touch with beautiful and expensivethings , while the moronic Rich had no touch at all but banged cars into place , trusting to luck . Rich sat in the attendant 's little shack , playing with a plastic game in which numbered squares of about twenty digits could be slid from place to place , the object being to line up the numbers in correct order ; and while magnificentpeople drifted by him and the Sheraton-Cadillac Hotel sent its lovely lights out into the night in a spangled pattern someone asp120gifted as Jules might interpret , Rich saw nothing except the little flat rectangle of plastic in his hand , as if the mysteries and secrets of the world were present in this and had already shown themselvestoo difficult for him . " Hey , look how close I came to getting them in this time , " Rich would say to Jules , who was dreaming and brooding at his elbow , and he would shove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no use for games and was slightly puzzled by them , by the energy people shot into them and lost forever . Rich had a short neck and a small , round head upon which a gray woolen cap seemed to have been pulled permanently ; his manner was that of a studious but slow child , more childish than Jules 's sister Betty , and his frequent appreciative smiles were not comforting . When the lot was filled up , which often happened as early as nine o'clock on a weekend night or on a Wednesday , and a period of quiet lasted until about midnight , Jules sat sunk in his own thoughts , smoking a cigarette , estimating how far it really was across the street and over to that hotel . The distance between the hotel and the parking lot was nothing , but the distance between the parking lot and the hotel was everything ; many times he had helped a man who had had too much to drink , putting his hands gingerly on the stranger 's good coat or stooping to retrieve his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see how the steps they took together , while appearing to be the same steps , were in reality far different . They were not walking together , not really . The tips of a dollar or more he sometimes got were a sign of this difference and that it existed powerfully and irreparably . He always said , " Thank you , sir , " brightly , mechanically ; but he could not summon up in his heart any real hatred for the rich . He felt that his true essence was of great value and would someday be expressed in ordinary signs of cars and women , and in that sense he was already one of them , though disguised from them in a windbreakerwith soiled cuffs and collar and in a punk 's slightly blemishedface . It was lively tonight and even Rich was hurried , mumbling words of greeting and gratitude into faces that seemed not to hear them , and Jules felt his energy strain upward to its highest pitch at about eleven o'clock , then begin to subside alarmingly as if he werep121turning into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peered at himself anxiously in a mirror , glad to see that he still looked all right , and for a long moment he sat there , trying to relax , to collect his thoughts . His grandmother . . . the clinic . All right . He had got through that . Her slow bleeding insides . . . if she wanted to bleed she would bleed . She would die to spite them . The fight at the supper table had come and gone . It might have happened days ago . It was over , forgotten . What did he care about their fights ? Sometimes his father banged out the back door , sometimes he slapped Loretta 's face , sometimes he slapped someone else 's face , sometimes he broke a chair or a plate  --  it hardly mattered . Jules was too old to run away . It was shameful to be always running away . Until a few years ago he had run away from home every few months , curious about the city or bitter about home , and he had always ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though anonymous , a confusion of homes . Whimpering , sniveling kids , black and white , too many of them . Everyone was tired . Bones stuck out angrily . Yellowish teeth were prominent . Too much . Running away was a mistake . He was too old now to run away but too young to move out . His father was n't going to run him out of the house . He adjusted the rear-view mirror in the Lincolnand looked at himself again , seriously . Did he have the looks to get him out of this Lincoln and into one of his own ? Did he have the brains ? Or would something in him give out before he was old enough to collect all the rewards his imagination promised him ? The lot closed at two and he drifted off toward home , cold but dully excited . He was always in a state of excitement , of queer , formless tension . There was little traffic on Fort Street . He crossed through an alley beside a garage , his hands stuck in his pockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky was misted over with cloud or smog , and he felt that he could make his way without being seen into any building or house in the city . A pang of excitementseized him , almost a pang of lust . He wondered if he could break into a building tonight , alone , on his own , why not ? With Ramie and other boys he had made his way into darkened stores and had lugged out merchandise , nothing too heavy or expensive or personal , and they had never been caught . With his friends he wasp122visible , just as they were , and a clumsy chain linked them all togetherno matter how fast they ran ; by himself he was light as air , with all possibilities open before him , just as they were open to the enviable heroes of books and movies . He paused at the end of the alley and looked up and down the street . On his own , now ; he was entirely on his own . The block was a block of commercial buildings , all dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Construction Co . Nothing here . He walked on . He approached a bar and grill , George 's , closed for the night . In George 's would there be some cash lying around ? Could he break into a cigarette machine or was n't that worth the risk ? What about a burglar alarm ? All the money he 'd made this evening he had to turn over to his mother or risk her hysteria , and only the tips , which he kept quiet about , were his own . But anythinghe stole was entirely his own . No one else had anything to do with it . The money he got here and there , secretly , would pile up out of sight and help him transform his life . He headed for George 's , which was one of those taverns on a corner that are made of concrete and look like a great concrete block , with narrow slits of windows . The neon lighting was turned off . Jules supposed that there was a back entrance , an easy way in ; maybe he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break open the door . He stood out front , waiting . He missed his friend Ramie , who would have known exactly what to do . He walked around the side of the building . Some junk lay in back . A back door , a mess of garbage pails , boxes . He walked all the way around the building , beginning to be nervous . It was too dark . Too quiet . Out in front again , by a street light , he stood for a few minutes to give himself time to think . He lit a cigarette . A squad car turned the corner , cruising slowly . Jules made a mistake  --  he took a guilty step backward . He turned and began to walk . He walked slowly , bringing his elbows closer to his body ; he did not look around at the car . But it was too late  --  he had made a mistake . The car braked to a stop in the middle of the street , the door flew open , and a cop yelled , " Hey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw his cigarette away . His brain went blank and he turned to run . He headed up an alley , running , and now he knew that he had really made a mistake but he could n't stop . How could he stop ?  |p123The  cop was yelling , " Stop ! Get back here ! " and though it flashed through Jules 's mind that he was in danger , he still could not stop . He dashed around a pile of junk and fled across the barrenback yard of some high building , turning his ankle , not even crying out , and behind him the cop was muttering something loudly . Jules thought that he had to hide , but shrewd and fast as such thoughts came , his body kept on running in panic and would not be brought to earth . Jesus Christ help me ! Jules thought , reaching out for a building 's rough brick wall and trying to flatten himself against it . He 's going to kill me . He knew enough not to cross back to the street again , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fled along a side street he had never seen before , past small , darkened one-story homes . Behind him the policeman fired his first shot . Jules had no idea how close the bullet came . He lunged for someone 's porch , thinking maybe he could crawl under it , but , panicked , he had no time to stop and kept on running into the back yard of the house . There was an old doghouse there but luckily no dog , and just as the cop shouted , " Stop ! " and fired anothershot , Jules dived through a broken fence . He got to his knees and then to his feet and found himself running alongside another small house out toward another street . He was sobbing . He had no idea what was happening . On the street a car 's headlights flashed , and he thought madly the squad car had doubled back and was about to run him over , so he turned to the side and smashed through someone 's bushes , getting scratched on the face . He ran panting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounding violently . He felt pain in his side , in his chest , but more than anything his brain seemed to be throbbing with surprise and anger , asking , How did this happen ? How did you let it happen ? " I got you ! " cried the cop , and Jules felt sure the bullet would get him in the back , but he felt it whiz by him . Nothing to do but run . Keep going . If he could get over to his own neighborhood where he knew places to hide . . . basements , warehouses , sheds , garages , his own house . . . but the cop would not let him run in that direction , he seemed to be steering Jules , herding him off into the dark . Though it was dark Jules was becoming visible : he could feel himself becoming visible . Two or three shots rang out . Jules burst his way into someone 's shanty and there , panting , weeping like a child , he fell to his knees and embraced his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be found here . Then suddenly he heard the cop 's footsteps again ; he could hear the man muttering right up to the shanty itself . The footsteps thudded against the ground . The door was kicked open . " Do n't shoot me ! " Jules cried . He was bent over , kneeling , with his shoulders hunched as if he were trying to bend himself in two . " I did n't do anything ! " Jules said , sobbing . He shut his eyes and leaned toward the ground , his hands hard on the back of his neck , gripping his neck . " Hey , you little bastard , little motherfucker , trying to run away on me ! " the cop cried . He put the barrel of his pistol against Jules 's head . " You know what I 'm going to do ? Going to blow out all your brains , kid , you smart-ass kid , running me all over the goddam neighborhood ! " And he pulled the trigger , but it clicked upon an empty chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on Jules 's head . Jules fell . He felt himself being kicked , being turned over onto his back ; he felt his pockets being turned inside out and something taken , and he began to weep with his eyes closed , too terrified to play dead . When the cop left , Jules did not move . It was strange that so much noise had n't brought people out back , or maybe it would not bring them out of their houses but make them hide under their bedclothes . Nothing happened . He heard boat whistles from the river . He lay still . Time passed . He shivered convulsively ; his head felt soft and wet where the gun had struck him . He had better get home . But for a while he could not move , as if he were paralyzed  --  his legs too weak or too cunning to move . Finally he got onto his stomach , then onto his hands and knees . He was breathing very hard . He found his empty wallet lying a few inches away and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet . His head pounded violently , but it was something he could stand . Punishment for his mistake . Being stupid was a mistake . One false move , a guilty step , running when he should not have run , should have met that cop face to face . He wept silently , in pain , ashamed , and made his way back out to the street . It was after three when he finally got home . He washed his face in the bathroom , wincing with pain . Maureen came to see what was going on . He said , " Go back to bed , mind your own goddamp125business . " He pushed the door shut so that she could n't see him , but when he came out she was still standing there . " What happened ? " she said . " Did somebody beat you up ? " " No . Nothing . " Maureen stared at him . " They did n't take your money , did they ? " He tried to get by her . " Jules , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He pushed past her on his way to bed . She said , " That 's going to drive Ma wild . " He fell onto his unmade bed and slept . The next sound he heard was an alarm clock going off in his parents ' room . He got out of bed . He had n't undressed so he did n't bother to change . He looked all right . There was some dried blood on his head , a bruise . His head pounded . But that was all right , he could stand it . What sickened him was his stupidity . He tasted vomit , thinking of how stupid he was . After his father left for work he went out into the kitchen and had some coffee , standing . Loretta was sitting at the table . She stared dully at him . " What time did you get in last night ? " she said . " The usual time , " he said . There was a pause as she waited , dense with politeness , for him to say something more  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? But he said nothing . She watched him , sleepily and a little sullen . " When are you coming home tonight , if I may ask ? " she said . " The usual time , " said Jules . He escaped from her and got outside , though he had two hours before school started . He walked around . He ran and reran in his imagination that chase behind buildings and through alleys , wondering how it would look in the daylight . The cop had yelled at him , warned him . I 'm going to get you ! Jules had been too stupid to get away and too stupid to turn around and face the cop . That pistol had slammed down on his head , hard . Jules had bowed his head and down onto his head had come the pistol , very hard , meaning to crack his skull . That was almost that . Almost the end of Jules . The high school was fenced off from one of the city 's busierp125streets . Against the fence , blown up to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jules leaned against the fence and smoked a cigarette . He tried to get himself calm . At a quarter to nine he made his way inside with a crowd of other kids . He inched by instinct toward his friends , who were already idling in the corridors by their lockers , hating school but somehow drawn by its walls and noise and its scent of prison , an instinct with them too . They were joking about something . They banged their lockers shut . Jules 's head ached , and he turned away from them and went to his homeroomjust as the final bell was ringing , not a second before . He did this every morning . It was all right ; he had n't died . Three seats over to his right was the girl he was in love with , a blond , small-nosed girl who wore pleated skirts and white wool socks and sneakers and who rarely looked at him , being for some reason nervous of him and his sideburns and smirky stylized grin . He allowed himself to fill with an eerie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while his homeroom teacher  --  a woman in her fifties , frail and spidery  --  talked to them about fillingout health-card forms . When was your most recent dental examination ? Jules looked over at the girl . Shc was no better off than he was , her parents were just as low , but she carried herself carefully , with an eye for what was neat and proper and clean ; her friends were good girls , like herself , though more given to horseplay than she ; her name was Edith . Jules loved her . He dreamed about her . . . When the bell rang , he made his painful way to the front of the room to say to his teacher , " My ma forgot to write my excuse for yesterday , " and the woman dismissed him , a little nervous of him and his friends and put off perhaps by his glazed eyes . His breath too  --  it tasted stale . Everything about him was stale  --  but at least he was alive . He walked slowly and carefully to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember where his assigned seat was , and a daring girl giggled at him , Jules so clumsy this morning , but finally he located the seat and fell into it . English class . He opened his notebook . He had forgotten , or lost , his English textbook . He groped around in the desk and came across someone 's book , not exactly the English text but near enough in color to it . Jules staredp126toward the front of the room . The teacher was already talking . The blackboard was watery . Something was being written on the blackboard  --  handwritinglarge enough but strangely jumbled . Jules squinted ; he brought his fingers to his eyes and pressed them , trying to see . What was all that ? Coming around the corner the firehouse . . . Jules leaned forward and let his elbows grope against the desk top , seeking support . He felt his mind go blank , then come back to life . He was slipping off . With his fingers spread around his eyes he tried to hang onto consciousness , desperate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher turned his head , then turned it another way , a bald head , talking , and Jules felt himselffalling . Something scuffed against his thigh , maybe a rat , and with dreamy loathing he recalled a rat jumping up against him when he 'd been about seven or eight , fooling around somewhere , and a rat had leaped toward him and ricocheted from him in a panic , pushing off violently from his thigh . He remembered it now , vividly , and felt the rat leaping crazily against his thigh and pushing itself off in terror , and in a numb terror of his own Jules began to lean forward , his head slowly dropping , his forehead slowly moving to the top of the desk . When Maureen was thirteen they moved from the houseon Twentieth Street to another like it on a street namedLabrosse , still in the same neighborhood but closer now to TigerStadium and not far from the New York Central railroad terminal , a great gothic building with hundreds of windows . She was too old to explore buildings and vacated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelling through warehouses with a bunch ofother kids . She held herself back , she carried herself cautiously , af raid but not knowing exactly why she was afraid . Moving fromone house to another disturbed her . She could n't sleep for manynights in the new house . All those boxes , the trouble , her mothersweating and angry and her father grunting with the effort of carryingthings , everything in a turmoil , uprooted  --  she was frightened.  |p127Even  Jules lost patience with her . " Oh , come off it , " he said , poking her to get her going , growing up himself now and always in a hurry . Even sitting down he had a distracted look , as if he were making plans for what he would do when he got up . She admired him , she resented him . She went through the pockets of his trouserswhen he hung them up in his room , looking for evidence of his larger , mysterious life , a life lived away from her . The house they lived in now was like a barn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sidewalk . There were only a few feet of yard , without grass ; a few broken bricks , some rocks , unidentifiable junk , ruts and footprints hardened in the earth . The house had once been painted gray . When you ran up the front steps the third step sagged . There was a closed-in , sly feeling to the whole neighborhood , that put off strangers  --  policemen or plainclothesmen on the prowl , water-meter men , gas-meter men , welfare snoops , social workers  --  the welfare bumps , as Loretta called them . The women would yell from one back yard to another , " The Investigator is coming ! " when just about anyone showed up who did n't belong in the neighborhood . Sometimes Jehovah 's Witnesses came through and argued with the Catholics . Her mother sank into the neighborhood and made friends at once . On any morning women just like her , older or younger , pregnantor not pregnant , were to be seen hurrying out in their cotton dresses , their hair wound up on plastic rollers , anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was all that noise ? what happened with that nigger in a car down the street , did he run into someone ? " Oh , them niggers , " Loretta would complain pleasantly to her neighbors , being understood at once . " Them niggers have a birth rate twice as much as white people , or ten times , I forget which , and they 're all on ADC and play poker with the checks . I know all about it . " She complained about the new house , about her mother-in-law , about her kids . She complained about her husband . Everything she said was understood at once ; she sank into the neighborhood and might have been living there all her life . They had had to leave their old house because part of a block was to be tom down  --  for a reason , they were n't sure why . Someonesaid a park was going to be built there . But years were to pass and no park appeared , only a half-block of demolished houses andp129pipes and miscellaneous rubble , open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been planned , or maybe it had been forgotten . Anyway , the Wendalls had had to move . Not that Loretta really regretted the move , once she made friends . It was just that she hated to be kicked around . She told Maureen and Betty every morning at breakfast , " Look , do n't you let anybody kick you around today . Jules I do n't need to tell , he knows what 's what in this world . But you two , you 're dumb enough to get pushed around , and just do n't stand for it  --  tell them you do n't take no mess . Do n't ever let anybody push you around . " " Oh , Ma , " Maureen would say in embarrassment , " pushed around how ? Who 's going to push us around ? " " Not the nuns and not any other kids . Remember that , " Loretta said . " Nobody 's going to mess with me , " Betty said . Maureen emerged from the house onto the sagging veranda with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kick her around today ? It was true that somebody always kicked her around  --  an older girl or an older boy , a nun patroling the corridor , or Betty  --  Betty might push her around , having the strength of greater simplicity and tighter , tougher muscles . Maureen thought it was all crazy , this worry about being kicked around , when all you had to do was recoil with the blow and start to cry as soon as possible  --  not like Jules , who had refused to cry for years now , no matter what happened ; not like Betty , who always seemed to be asking for more . Maureen walked out onto the veranda each morning , clutchingher books and her lunchbag , and let her eyes wander out onto the street to see if there was any danger . The veranda was so long that all the kids who lived in the house and kids from next door could play on it , making forts of crates and arranging them into two camps . On one side of the veranda was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' door . When it rained the kids slammed in and out of those doors and hung around the porch , the little kids busy with their noisy games and the older kids like Maureen and Betty and Faith , from next door , reading comic books . After the Wendalls had lived there a month the Stanleys moved and another family , with six children and a deep drawling accent , moved in . They said they were fromp130Kentucky . All their things were in a truck , loaded up and covered with sheets , and Jules and Maureen and Betty helped them unpack , excited with their new neighbors . Six children ! On moving day Maureen felt giddy and out of control , so much was happening , so much was always happening , so much noise ! So many faces ! So many footsteps , so many mothers and fathers and children to keep straight ! Loretta brought out some beer in cans . Maureen and the kids ran through the rooms of the other part of the house , overturning boxes and shrieking with laughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved in . She wished they might live alone in a house for once . So with a nail she made jagged little marks in the wallpaper of what had been Faith 's parents ' bedroom . After a while everyone forgot about the Stanleys , who had moved to Grand Rapids . The new people were named Stonewall . Mrs. Stonewall came over to talk with Maureen 's mother all the time , and they sat on the veranda and sipped beer or coffee and smoked , the two of them exactly the same age , wearing slacks that were a little too tight across the back or skirts that were a little too long for this year , while behind them small children played and the radio squawked with no one to listen to it . On Saturdays , Maureen had to get out of the house because of all the noise ; she walked two miles or so to the library , where it was quiet . The library was like a home should be , quiet . As she walked she muttered to herself about what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother : how she would take care of all those kids , punish them when they needed it , give them a good slap and a good spanking and even , for the worst of the kids like her sister Betty , find some dark wet place  --  the " dungeon " under the veranda  --  and nail her up in it until she was good . She wondered what was wrong with being quiet  --  people were always saying she was too quiet . Loretta was always after her for having " secrets , " which meant that she was quiet , and Grandma Wendall talked about her " long face . " " She has a long face and she eats with long teeth , " the old woman said sourly . Maureen was puzzled at her grandmother 's dislike : had n't the old woman liked her at one time ? Had n't she liked Jules at one time ? Now she sat around , sick and sour , leaning on a cane even while she sat , as if to emphasize her swollen legs and feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies . Maureen thought her face was no longer than anyone else 's , and it was not a bad-looking face . She tried to be quiet and composed and orderly , and this perhaps irritatedpeople . " Oh , what a fuss you make ! " her mother sometimes screamed when Maureen insisted upon counting every stamp in the stamp-redemption book , or inspected dishes to see if they were really clean , or asked if she could wash her hair more than once a week . But her mother screamed at everyone , her own kids and the Stonewall kids and the kids across the way  --  it meant nothing . Mrs. Stonewall screamed too . It meant nothing . In the next instant they flopped down and lit cigarettes and forgot about being angry . Maureen'sheart would still be pounding but already her mother had forgotten , would forget anything , and that was why she trudged up , the street alone , muttering to herself , and why she daydreamed at school , thinking of punishments that would keep everyone good and quiet so that her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school the Mother Superior , a nun with a man 's wise , gnarled face , called Maureen into her office one day and said , " Maureen , it 's up to you to watch your sister at recess . You 're the oldest . " " Yes , Sister , " Maureen said . " Your sister is quarrelsome and impudent . She 's like your brother . It 's up to you , your mother said , to watch her during recess . So she hated Betty and hated them all and wished they would die . She would like to shovel all their bodies under the veranda , in that dark , musty , leaf-strewn dungeon where spiders and other nasty things lived . Or maybe she would crawl under there herself and hide , let her mind go quiet and blank , give herself a good rest so that she could get her life straightened out . In the public library the ceilings were so high she was always glancing up nervously . It seemed to her that the ceiling sometimes floated away . The floors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uneven . Maureen could not quite believe in the silence  --  it was like a beautiful glass vase that might be shattered at any moment . She took her books far into the reading-room , where she could sit at a table by the " Great Books of the Western World " and by a hot radiator , and read for hours . The silence in the libraryp132really was not broken often , though she expected it to be . People even walked quietly here . There were few children . She read through the Young People 's Shelf , book by book . She did not allow herself to pick books at random , because that way she might miss something important . And each week she made herself go back to the beginning to check whether any new books had been put on the shelf , books returned that week or brand-new books with blank cards in the pockets at the back . Discovering these books , she smiled with a kind of cautious surprise . The librarian reminded her of the principal of her school , so Maureen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her . Because she controlled the library she had a terrible authority over Maureen'slife . One day , at the desk , she leafed idly through a book Maureen was returning and discovered a large tear down one page . " How did this happen ? " she said . " It was there when I took the hook out , " Maureen whispered . " It was not there . All our books are checked . " As if to prove this , she turned a few more pages and came across a mended tear . It had been mended with transparent tape that had turned yellow . " See ? Like this . It would have been mended , " the woman said . " I do n't know how it happened , " Maureen said . " I did n't do it ! " She saw the woman 's eyes move coldly over her , Maureen in a sweater of loose knobby wool , worn at the elbows and uneven in back ; Maureen looking guilty , with her legs absurdly thin and exposed . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took it out , " the woman said . Maureen began to nod , frightened . She must be guilty . Someone must have done it at home , by accident , but it was her fault . Her fault . She should not have brought a library book into such a house . " You 'll have to pay a fine , I 'm afraid , " the librarian said . " Twenty-five cents . " " I 'll bring it tomorrow , " Maureen said . " All right . But you ca n't take any books out today . " " I 'll bring it tomorrow , " Maureen said . In her relief at being released so easily , she forgot her disappointment at not being ablep133to take out any books . For a moment she felt the desperate gloatingof a criminal . She was allowed to walk out of the library and walk home and nothing had happened to her . At home she did not bother to ask Loretta for the money but waited until Jules came in . She hung around the bathroom while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leaned over the sink . She saw that the hairs on his arms were thick and dark and that his chest was hairy . He looked very tired . She said shyly , " I got in some trouble today and need some money for a fine . " " How much ? " said Jules . " A quarter , " said Maureen . " Okay , here , " he said , giving her a quarter , and she felt a little sickened to think that she was deceiving her brother . She really had a few cents saved , out in a tin can in the garage , but it was money for something special and she had made a vow to the Virgin not to use it for a year . Saving money was a secret no one else was to know about and a secret that made her different from all of them . She wondered if Jules too was saving money : he was like her , secretive beneath the prominent open bones of his face . There were so many crowded in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to time there was Aunt Connie , who was sick off and on but who worked in a laundry when she was well . Aunt Connie had had a bad life , Grandma Wendall said in a whisper . ( Her insides operated on ? Her husband killed in a car accident or run off to California ? Which was it ? ) Aunt Connie was heavy and seemed very old , older than Loretta , and sometimes her very sluggishness brought her so low that Loretta wanted to help her up again , and therefore liked her , but at other times her sluggishnessgot on Loretta 's nerves so that she ran next door to Flora Stonewall and cried , " That bitch ! That fat-ass bitch ! Either she goes or I go , tonight I 'm telling him for sure ! " And of course Belly , who shared a room with her , and Jules was in and out of his room , not making much noise but still a presence , a human being , crowdingupon her . Their father had a job that paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ? Where did it go ? He was a stout man who carried a lunch pail and wore the same pair of grimy dark trousers all the time , on workdays or days off . His shirts were blue.  |p134He  seemed often to be contemplating his own big hands , lying on the kitchen table or on his lap . He seemed to approach everything with a sideways look : food , ale , people , the television set . He was cautious , suspicious , closed . Then , as minutes passed , he opened himself up to supper or television , moving in , beginning to sveatheliked to eat and drink , he ate and drank passionately , and he liked all television shows . He was suspicious at first and then he opened himself up . Maureen had learned this . His favorite place was a tavern a few blocks away , the Holiday Grill , which had two large dusty plants in its windows , plants with spearlike leaves  --  seeing plants like that always made Maureen think of her father , even years after he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spears . There was something dense about her father and , beneath the density , a sharpness that was frightening . One night he 'd moved sideways into supper , eating and sweating , and only when supper was almost over did he look at Jules . Then he said , " What 's this about Malone ? " Maureen had noticed her brother 's alarm , which was a giveaway . He tried to cover it up by saying smoothly , " I do n't know , what about him ? " " He got himself roughed up , hell ? " " I do n't know . " " What do you mean , you do n't know ? " " Duane Tracey was saying something  --  " " You little shit , do n't you lie to mc ! You know all about it ! " " I do n't know all about it ! " Jules said . " What the hell happened to him ? " said Loretta . " He got beat up . He got his goddam smart-aleck face kicked in for him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell why he was angry : was he happy that Ramie had been hurt , or sorry ? " Yeah , what happened ? " Loretta said . " That punk thought he 'd pull something smart  --  I heard it down at the corner  --  he stopped a nigger kid over on Hastings who was carrying a bag with some cash in it , and the stupid goddam bastard never thought he 'd get caught ! Them niggers caught up with him in an hour ! " Maureen 's father said . His face was shining and vicious ; again he was not looking at Jules . Jules was not looking at him either . " What kind of a stupid son-of-a-bitch of a punkp135would hustle a runner for the numbers , eh ? What kind of a punk ? A nigger kid twelve years old that 's running with four thousand dollars in a bag ai n't no kid on his own , you stupid bastard ! You think a kid with four thousand dollars in a paper bag is out on his own going shopping ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do n't call me names , I was n't mixed up in it , " Jules said . " You 'd better as hell not be . But if you were , they 'd of got youby now . Kicked your teeth in for you , how 'd you like that ? " " I did n't have anything to do with it . " " No , you 're too smart ! Jesus Christ , that 's one good thing , " Maureen 's father said , but without relief , still with a kind of perplexedanger . " They kicked the kid 's teeth out . Half of them out . They banged up his eye for him . They broke four of his ribs for him . What they did to the rest of him I do n't know , but they did n't hold back , I bet , and even if they are niggers I got to admit he got what 's coming to him  --  that smart-aleck little bastard always roaming around on the street ! " " Look , I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But you know all about it , do n't you ? " " No . " " You sit there and lie to me , eh ? " They were not looking at each other , and Maureen could feel the tension building up between them . She wanted to put her hand on Jules 's arm and whisper , " Give in , " but Jules , his pale face strained , showed all his hatred in the very set of his mouth . Loretta steered them out of it by saying , " Hey , I made some pudding tonight . You all want pudding ? " Later on that night Maureen 's father said with a sullen sigh , " Them niggers will get control of this city yet . They 'll put a padlockon it and put up roadblocks and , brother , that will be the end ! " Loretta sat watching television with him , in her spangled straw bedroom slippers . She said , " The police should get them for beatingRamie Malone up . I do n't care what you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was sort of a nice-looking kid . " " I would n't be surprised they cut him up fine . They like to cut people up , " Maureen 's father said slowly . " Down at the plant , ifp136you fool around in the parking lot after the other guys have gone , you 're taking a chance . They do n't just take your money , they cut you up . They like to do that . It 's what they do for fun . " On other nights Maureen heard him talk about the Polacks , who stank , and the greasy spies , who were moving into one end of BagleyStreet itself , all of them jabbering away like crazy , carrying knives , drinking and fighting each other right out on the sidewalk .. . Jules , making fun of his father to Maureen , said , " Them niggers , them Polacks , them spies ! Jesus Christ , how I 'm sick of having to hate them all ! What a pain in the ass it gives me ! " When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaw droop , so that his eyes took on a moronic expression . Maureen had to laugh , but then she felt a warning , which had to do with their grandmother'sconstant remark : " Make a face and your face will freeze . " Make a face and your face will freeze . She saw them all with their frozen faces , her mother and father , her sister , her brother , her grandmother , her aunt , the faces of the nuns at school , the faces of the priests , the faces of the kids in the neighborhood , the faces of all the world  --  frozen hard into expressions of cunning and anger , while she , Maureen , having no hardnessto her , crept in silence among them and waited for the day when everything would be orderly and neat , when she could arrangeher life the way she arranged the kitchen after supper , and she too might then be frozen hard , fixed , permanent , beyond their ability to hurt . Her mother concentrated attention on faces , as if she 'd learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its origin , she adopted a singsong joviality when she and Maureen went out shopping , indicating people by saying , " Look at the horseface ! " " Look at the sow's-face ! " " Look behind you and see the monkey ! "  --  getting Maureen to look over her shoulder and into a mirror . Loretta 's face was sometimes flabby and ugly , sometimes rather pretty , sometimes the pores of her nose loomed large and black , sometimes not , it was up and down , ugly and pretty , messy and neat , and who could tell which Loretta would step out of her cluttered bedroom ? All this made Maureen concentrate upon herself . Her mother directed attention that way anyhow ; she oftenp137said , squinting at Maureen , " Is your face breaking out ? You 're about at that age now for lots of pimples . " Around the five rooms that made up their half of the duplex everything was in Loretta 's domain . She presided over them all . As soon as their father returned in the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made his way around the piles of clothes that needed to be washed or ironed or were just lying around , and Betty 's junk underfoot , and Maureen hunched over the kitchen table trying to do her homework . He ate the food Lorettamade for him . Even when Maureen actually prepared it , it was still Loretta 's food , and the house smelled of her  --  her " bath salts , " her perfume , her cigarette smoke . Even when he ran out of silence finally and slapped her , shouting something into her face , she was still at the very center of the house , passive and indolent and vicious . Through all this , Maureen worked at her homework and tried not to be distracted . She was fairly good in school . Betty was no good at anything except showing off . Jules had n't even brought a report card home in months . His eyes looked dark and hollow and he lived a life of secrets : a girl at school told Maureen that Jules went out drinking with other boys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he was a friend of Ramie Malone and you know what happened to Ramie . Maureen looked through his pockets and found odd things  --  a broken black plastic comb , filthy , a matchbook with " Manhattan Lounge " on the cover , Kleenex crumpled and smeared with lipstick , a broken key chain , loose coins , slugs , peanuts , various junk . She knew he was flunking out of school but did not dare ask him about it . And Betty , Betty was a little brat  --  she was so loud and dopey that Maureen would rather take the long way home from school so she would n't have to walk with Betty , though that meant she would miss the store windows and the Rialto Theater , whose posters changed once a week and were of great interest . Monday was her mother 's day for having her hair washed and set by her friend Ethel , and plucking her eyebrows and doing her nails . On Monday her lips and her fingernails would be the same shade of dark grape . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women on those movie posters ; they wanted certain things and were willing to takep138risks to get them . Maureen 's mother took her shopping in a supermarketand they brought back food in paper bags with red and black squares , and yellow stamps for the book ; that was her mother'sway of getting things . On those Saturdays when it was too cold to go to the library Maureen had to stay home . She hated home . She sat for hours looking out the window . There was nothing to see . Just the partly crumbling concrete base of the house next door , a house as old and ugly as theirs . Not that this house was theirs ; every month Maureen'sfather grumbled about paying the rent . What he paid was a secret . Adults had many secrets , mostly dealing with money . It could be shouted out that Loretta was a bitch or Howard was a lazy bastard , anything might be shouted out that had to do with people , but nothing about money  --  the facts of money  --  could be mentionedout loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a secret how much her father made every week , and how much he gave her mother ; it was even a secret how much some things cost . Aunt Connie complained about making only fifty dollars a week when she worked , but that was just like her  --  she was always whining , always coughing up things you did n't want to hear . When she came in the kitchen to complain about her life to Loretta , Maureensighed and moved closer to the window of her room , wanting to get out , to go deaf , wondering why the winter glare that made everything so hard and colorless was somehow better than the close , stale odor of their house . After all , she did love her mother and father . She loved Jules . She even loved Betty , if only Betty would wise up , and so why did she want to see them all dead and buried under the front porch ? Even Jules , dead and buried and put to rest . Most of the time Maureen daydreamed . In her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kids obeyed her and lined up . There were no adults anywhere to punish or even to praise . It was peaceful and good without them now that she was taking their place and doing what they should have done . Or she closed her eyes and played school . She was the teacher , a nun , and all the kids on the block were sitting in rows ; she made them read their lessons one by one , going up and down the aisle . She made them go to the blackboard and add up long columns of figures . If they made mis/takes they were scolded in front of everyone and not allowed to make excuses  --  if they were allowed to make excuses they would only say , " I could n't do my homework last night , there was some trouble at my house , " or " I had to go out last night and I could n't get any sleep . " No , this was like no other school . " Here you 've got to work . To work , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound , thinking of the captive children and herself watchingover them , guarding and bullying them , a different Maureen from the girl everyone knew . Why could n't people be perfect ? Why did they make such mistakes ? Doing her homework , Maureenchecked and rechecked everything , fearful of making mistakes . Even when she played , even in her imagination she was somehow afraid of making a mistake . A year ago she 'd still played horses , but now she was getting too old . She had played the leader of a herd of horses , a great black stallion . She had dug her heels into the earth and kicked into the air , playing alone , concentrating painfully on being a horse  --  she had played in secret , shaking her long hair like a mane . Around the house or in the presence of other children she never let herself go like that . She did n't " play . " She was not large for her age but she seemed somehow older , and that was why , when something went wrong in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calmly that she 'd fix it  --  spilled food , a broken plate , something Betty might have done . She never made excuses . One time when her mother and Flora Stonewall had spent the whole day drinking beer and telling stories about their childhoods , and her mother had done nothing about starting supper , Maureen had taken over in the kitchen and both women had teased her . " Look at Maureen , she 's going to make somebody a good wife , " Flora said . She was a handsome , lazy woman with long red hair , sometimes tied back from her face . Her arms were big , big-boned , and her legs were rather thick . Her voice was musical in a slightly accusing , singsong way : she seemed to like Maureen . Scraping garbage into the smelly pail ender the sink , doing the dishes until her face was flushed from the heat , Maureen forced her mind to concentrate upon the schoolroomshe presided over or upon the ravine in which the wild horses lived or upon the library with its waxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's typewriter . When she was byp140herself her thoughts wandered to these things . She sometimes woke to find herself standing in a doorway , absent-mindedly caressingher own arm , while Loretta sailed past and said , " Wake up , kid , the house is on fire . " She woke to see her family at supper , shapes inside clothes , weighed down in their chairs . It made her dizzy to think of them this way . Her father was a dense object , his shirt partly unbuttoned ; her mother was a fluttery , insubstantial object ; her grandmother was thick , heavy , brooding , dressed in black . One time , downtown , she had seen her own sister with a wild bunch of girls , fooling around by a bus stop . The girls were all dressed in blue jeans and sweatshirts . They surged around a corner and signaled a bus , and when the bus pulled over to stop and the door opened they ran away . Betty was shrieking with laughter , a hard , wiry little object , like a puppet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turning round and round on the sidewalk until she bumped against a passerby and her friends all laughed at her . Maureen had shrunk back , not wanting to be seen . Was that her sister , that awful girl with the dark blond hair cut short as a boy 's , shorter than Jules 's hair , that girl with her hard , muscular legs and her hoarse voice ? And she often watched Jules when he walked through the house , always tired , narrowing her eyes until her brother became a shadowyobject passing her , bringing out no response in her , no love or kinship . He was growing up and had to do the things grownups did . He had to entwine himself around some girl , he had tG do certain things with her and with the crowd he ran with , he had to work , he had to make money , he had to shave , to fuss with his hair , to run his hands wearily across his eyes , to answer in a sharp , ugly voice if someone bothered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would say , or to Betty , " I do n't have time for screwing around , get away . " He was always pushing himself off from them , always escaping . One day in spring , on her way home from the library , Maureen scared up a toad near a house on her block . She chased it under a nearby porch . She found a stick and tried to poke it into jumping , but the stick was n't quite long enough  --  there the toad sat , its body puffed and gulping , terrified but not moving , in a pile of leaves . She felt mean . She thought , If I crawled under the porch I could get that toad , and there was something in the very kinship between them , their similar breathlessness , their terror , that made her wantp141to crawl under . She poked around with the stick , leaning forward on her hands and knees , but the toad did not move ; they eyed each other in silence . When she got home Flora Stonewall was sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , Maureen , where you been ? I 'm spost to tell you something . " " What ? " " Your ma and grandma have gone somewhere . They did n't know where you were . Jules drove them . They told me I was spost to wait for you  --  " " What 's wrong ? " " I guess your pa had some trouble . " Maureen stared at her . " What kind of trouble ? With the po-lice ? " " Honey , no , do n't talk like that , " Flora said , pained , drawing her lips and eyebrows up in the same instant . " Your pa had some trouble at work . An accident . He got hurt at work . " " Hurt ? How ? " " I do n't know , honey . Why do n't you go inside or something ? You want a Royal Crown ? I got some in my refrigerator . You want one ? " " No . " " Loretta told me to wait for you . I 'm real sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel awful , honey . You sure you do n't want no Royal Crown ? Why do n't you come in my place and relax ? " " No , I 'm all right , " Maureen said . She went past Flora , dignified and cold with fear , and the very silence of their house told her : the end . The end of something . The front room looked like hell , the sofa 's slipcover was loose on one end and the lamp shade was crooked , sunlight from the side windowfell upon a worn brown rug ; it was all familiar , the very stalenessof the house was familiar and should have been a relief , but suddenly Maureen realized how temporary it was  --  even if it was ugly it was still temporary and it could still be lost . She went to lie on her bed , which was unmade . She looked up at the ceiling . She waited . After a while the back door opened and someone ran in . " Hey , Maureen , " aureen , " Jules called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her room and looked in . " Did she tell you , next door ? Tell you what happened ? " " Is Pa dead ? " " He 's in the hospital . " Maureen stared at him . It was a surprise to see how tall Jules was now . He did n't wear the tight-pegged pants of a year before , his hair was brushed back impatiently from his face , he looked shaken and sick . He said , " He 's going to die maybe . Another man did die who was with him . A ton of some stuff fell on them , two tons  --  " " Fell on them ? " " Something happened and it let loose . It fell on them . " They stared at each other . Finally Maureen said , wondering what to say , " He 's in the hospital ? " " They took him to the emergency ward at Ford 's . " She saw the hospital suddenly , a heavy building . " In the hospital ? " she said vaguely . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take you out for a hamburg or something . " Maureen covered her face with her hands . " Hey , kid , " Jules said quickly , " hey , do n't cry ! You do n't have to have a hamburg . It was Ma 's idea . I 'm supposed to take you and Betty out for some supper and then over to the hospital . Do n't cry  --  you want me to start bawling myself ? " Maureen took her hands slowly away from her face and Jules was still there . His face was pinched and white . " You would n't ever cry for anybody , " she said . " That 's a hell of a thing to say ! " Betty was nowhere around so they drove out to a Biff 's restauranton Woodward . Maureen felt liberated , daring , in the car  --  it was as if a holiday had come unexpectedly . " Did it really happen ? " Maureen kept asking . Jules glanced over at her . " Yes , sure . You think I 'd kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean . . . did it really happen like you said ? A ton of stuff fell on him ? " she asked . " Two tons , it was , " said Jules . If Jules could only keep driving forever ! Up north along the avenue , turning north continually , following any roads , getting themp143out of this city and away from the hospital where their father lay and had nothing to do with them , already changed , distant .. . Maureen kept gripping her face with her hands , feeling it , uncertainof her own face and skull , wondering at it . This skull could be crushed too . Jules glanced at her but said nothing about her odd behavior . Instead he said , as if knowing her thoughts , " It would be damn nice to keep on driving , huh ? Up to northern Michigan where there 's lots of lakes and woods , past the tree line , someplace where nobody has been yet but that 's cleared off and ready for us to move in . I can imagine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moose drinking from the lake . Or maybe it was in a picture I saw , in a magazine or on a calendar ... " It frightened her , the way his voice ran down suddenly . It seemed to lose energy . " What 's a moose exactly ? " she said . They went into the restaurant . Maureen had no appetite but , sitting next to Jules at the counter , reading through the menu again and again , she thought that she had better eat ; it was a privilege , being in a restaurant . They had hamburgers and French fries . Maureen ate everything , even the last burnt , wrinkled French fries . She rubbed her finger on the plate and licked salt from it . Jules said , muttering so no one else could hear , " Maybe he 's dead already . I hope so . Then we can get over waiting . We might come in the door and they 'll say he 's already dead ! And Ma will be bawling , and Grandma Wendall mad . We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , Your father is dead . " Maureen was ashamed now of having eaten so much . She had forgotten , in a way , why they were at Biff 's and not at home . " You never liked Pa , did you ? " she said softly . " It 's a rotten mess . Those women bawling . . . The hospital stinks , I ca n't stand that smell . No , I did n't like him , Remy , but shut up about it . Do n't you ever say that again . If I kidded around it was just for the hell of it  --  I mean , about wanting him to drop dead  --  for the hell of it and because . . . because I could n't stand it , him being so quiet ! I had enough of his quiet . " Jules wiped his hand under his nose suddenly . " It got next to me and almost drove me crazy sometimes . Jesus Christ , he taught me all I need to know about quiet ! "  |p144After  his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked in store windows like everyone else and allowed himself to be brushed by people passing him in a hurry , feeling himself invisible , floating . He was almost sixteen years old . He could not understand what that meant : sixteen years of age . His father 's death had sloughed off onto him the heaviness of his father'sspirit , and this heaviness , like a gas , was filling up inside him . He had heard that the dead collect gas , internally . Yet he was strangely lightheaded , though his feet ached . His head felt as if it might float away . The dirty sidewalks around him and the hurrying feet of other people were going one way ; and his brain seemed to be straining another way . There was something he had to get straight , come to peace with , but here he was , cold and disordered , lightheaded , crossing over to the Grand Circus Park , alive and dressed unnaturally in a good dark suit , while his father was dead and set in the ground . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face or anything he said , Jules thought in apanic . It was his father he had to come to grips with . It was not right that a man should live and die and come to nothing , be forgotten , with his own son unable to really remember him  --  it did not seem right . As Jules passed a park bench an old man watched him closely , as if about to recognize him . Jules looked away . He did not want to be recognized . His mother 's sloppy , whining grief and his sisters ' fear chilled him ; he did not want to be a part of it . He had to get away from everyone . So his father had been killed , so it had happened and was now quite naturally being passed by , and maybe his father had never really recognized him either , what difference did it make ? He tried to absorb it all . His mother could absorb nothing , everything spilled out of her like those hot painful tears and so he , Jules , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the movie houses , looking at posters  --  the handsome , made-up faces did not seem to mean anything to him . They could absorb grief , pain , joy , without strain  --  no lines appeared on their faces , nothing . Jules wondered if these faces would someday betray him . Inside the big old movie houses everything went on as usual , thin crowds came and went , there was the usual odor of soiled carpeting and stale popcorn and that musty darkness of old ,  |p145large  , downtown buildings , inexplicable . Jules stared at the posters , waiting to become interested . He stared at a photograph of Marlon Brando . Much of his life had come from movies , much of his languageand his good spirits . From the movies he had sensed that life is backed by music , but now , out on the sidewalk , he felt depressed and lifeless , and there was no music anywhere around him or the promise of music . His father had been  --  how old ? What pain had he felt ? And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father 's , the man who had sat for so long at a certain place at the table , the man who had eaten supper in a certain way every night , anxious to get it over ? The man Jules had always hated ? He walked slowly home . It was a long walk . The weather was cool , and he could not think of which season it was  --  spring or fall . The river looked steamy , but that was probably from factories on the west side . Smoke billowed up from a number of points . It rose and flowed gently across the Ambassador Bridge , passing through the bridge , making it look unreal ; cars and trucks drove through the smoke . Jules could not remember why he 'd come so far for a walk , what he was looking for , what he had hoped to figure out , when he had many things to do at home  --  his mother needed him  --  and he was uncomfortable in this suit . His mother needed him at home and would need him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river there were maybe bodies beneath the surface of the water , or at least there were stories kids told about seeing bodies bob to the surface and then disappear again . . . . The dead , the drowned , so silent and patient ... . Jules felt that these dark mysterious people moved about in ordinaryair , corpses that looked alive . You might stumble into one of them , fall into an embrace , feel that cold heavy breath upon you and that ratty , stringy cold hair . .. . Just what had his father been like , anyway ? Jules remembered suddenly his father trying to fix the toilet , trying to stop a leak . The bathroom door was warped . The linoleum was of various levels , bloated and worn smooth , so that when he sat in the bathroom Jules stared down at this landscape and had the vague idea that it was a relief map of something , a secret land . His father had tried to fix the toilet many times , the faucets many times . No luck . Thep146heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent struggle , and then , " Goddam it ! " and the noise of something being thrown down , a wrench or a pliers , whatever . The silence , the breathing and then the noise . That was his father . Never any luck fixing things . Roaches came out of the secret edges of the bathroomat night and sometimes they were still out in the morning , lazy things , and often they were in the kitchen cupboards and under the sink , very often  --  they made his father swear . The floor must have been a real landscape to the roaches . Jules narrowed his eyes and tried to think about his father . What had his father to do with roaches ? ' Why was it easier to think of them than of his father ? His father and money : that was important . That was maybe the secret . He had complained about money . He had n't complained about much , but when he did it was usually about money . Where did that money go , a paycheck 's worth ? Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the misery over money , the worry over money , not having enough , too many people to feed , a sick mother in the house , and every year the kids got flu and the antibiotics were very expensive . Pills were expensive . Loretta had had some trouble with her kidneys and had to take pills every six hours , and those pills were expensive , like everything else in the United States , very expensive , so that Jules 's father would say viciously , " One of these days I 'm taking off ! You can all go to hell ! " Or he would say , looking up from the newspaper where he 'd read something , " All the niggers are on welfare , why not me ? Us ? Everybody can go to hell ! " Jules had thought of his father 's anger during the Mass said for him . No special Mass , a funeral Mass . A dreary church . Jules had sat beside his mother , immensely weary of her sorrow , which was as confused and lightheaded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could depend upon her . . . . Jules had n't paid much attention to the funeral Mass . He no longer went to church . He felt the churches of the city drag at him as he passed , a melancholylure . They were like vast legendary caverns in the sea , luring swimmers down , breathing them in with mysterious currents  --  promises of secrets , rewards , a special knowledge that no longer mattered . He did not care . His father had not cared . There had n't been any anger in it , there had been only nothing . His father 's facep147smooth and blank as a skull with white skin stretched over it  --  that was his father . Jules could almost remember him . The Mass had obscured him , the dead man , but now he was returning to Jules , painfully . Anger was at the core of him . That was his secret  --  anger . But Jules had n't killed him . Yes , anger was at the core of him ; his soul was anger , made up of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , for life , for the assembly line , for the cockroaches and the dripping toilet . One thing was as good as another . Anger . No money . Where had the money gone ? Where would the money come from ? Anger , money . I Es father . Jules felt a flash of . satisfaction , almost of joy . No , he had n't - killed his father . His own anger had been kept back for years , kept successfully back ; he had n't hurt anyone . Money was an adventure . It was open to him . Anything could happen . He felt that his father'sessence , that muttering dark anger , had surrounded him and almost penetrated him , but had not quite penetrated him ; he was free . A few days later , on his way to school , he was thinking about this  --  his father , his father 's fury , his father 's money , his father 's death  --  when he saw something that jolted him . Then , a moment later , he realized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For an instant he could hardly move , staring at her , feeling the same sense of despair and wonder he 'd felt at his father 's death rising in him now at the sight of this girl . She was going up the concrete steps to a viaduct overpass with her girl friends . Jules ran to catch up with them . " Hey , " he said , " where are you going so fast ? " They looked around in surprise . One of the girls , the boldest one , grinned at him . She was the prettiest , but Jules was faithful to Edith ; he lurched over to her side of the walk . In their presence he had become slightly swaggering . " You always walk this way ? " he said . Edith shrugged her shoulders lightly . She had pulled her hair back into a ponytail . She had blondp148eyebrows and blond eyelashes , a chaste cold girl with no smile for him . Jules walked with his weight on his heels , his hands stuffed in his pockets , conferring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift ; he felt a slight tugging between him and the girls , a nervous exhilaration . He glanced at Edith sideways . She looked very nervous . The other girls began to talk to him , teasing flatly , gaining courage , and Jules answered them in the same style : Yeah , is that so , you would n't kid me ? " Where is your girl friend , Jules ? " they asked him . They stretched their mouths in a sweet accusatory way , and Jules made a face to show that he had no interest in this question . He did have a girl friend , his own girl , and so really had no need of Edith . His girl , Rose Ann , was no friend of girls like these ; her friends were knowing and sly and very sure of themselves . They wore stockings to school . Their ears were pierced , and their secrets were razzing and exciting and sleazy , while these girls , anxious to imitate their sophistication but afraid of it , tried to talk in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly contemptuous smile for all of them . They were halfway across the viaduct . The wind was quite strong . Edith 's frail bangs whipped about her forehead and she had to narrow her eyes against the flying dirt ; Jules saw tiny lines appear at the corners of her eyes . She had pale blue eyes and very pale skin . She wore no lipstick . Her coat was a yellow-and-white-check and already a little soiled from Detroit 's air and buses ; she carried a purse with a long strap that went over her shoulder . Jules thought she looked delightful . He did not know her at all . He took hold of the strap of her purse suddenly , thinking of the strap of her slip , and tugged at it . She pulled away from him , frightened . He could see the muscles move in her throat . He wanted to tell her not to be afraid of him , but instead he said , teasing , " What 's in here , ammunition ? This is pretty heavy . " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The three girls seemed to be dancing about him in the wind , though their feet in standard brown loafers were really not very graceful ; Jules smiled at all of them , at their shrill expectant faces . He did not let go of Edith 's purse . He said , " Hey , you got sonic pictures of yourself ? "  | " What do you care ? " " Do you have some ? Can I see ? " " Why ? What do you care ? " Edith said . She turned to face him . Her hair fluttered in the wind . " Give me a picture of yourself , huh ? Will you ? " It was the fashion that spring for high-school girls to have " portraits " taken of themselves , $3.99 for a number of prints , the portraitsin brown tone with fake velvet props and single strands of pearls and heavy makeup . They all went to an Italian photographernear school . Jules ached suddenly to get a photograph of Edith . He tugged at her purse . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know why you want one , probably just to be . . . " Either she ran out of courage or could not think of anything more to say . She took a blue plastic billfold out of her purse , and out of this , as Jules watched lovingly , she extracted a photograph and handed it to him . He was suddenly very excited . He wanted to take her hand , he wanted to kiss her , but she was already sidestepping as if she knew what was in his mind , and the other girls closed in upon her , as if protecting her . One of them said spitefully , " Do n't ask me for a picture because I would n't give you one ! " Jules paid no attention . He was staring at the photograph . It was brown-toned , and Edith sat rigid against a background of what looked like a starry night . Around her thin shoulders was a dark velvet cloth , a V in front , moderately daring . It was supposed to look like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her lips had been outlined too heavily ; her eyes looked pale , faded , overpowered by the heavy lines of her mouth . Jules thought that he could not help loving this girl , though he had no idea who she was . She was moving away , embarrassed and hurried . The other two girls looked back at him . " Thanks a lot ! I mean it , thanks ! " he called after them . Jules lagged behind . He stared at the photograph . Edith . Edith Kamensky . Having the photograph , he felt that he could afford to let the girl get away ; what could he say to her anyhow ? She had cool , cold , uncertain eyes . The lashes were scanty . There was a mole near the left side of her mouth . Wisps of hair lay about herp150temples , passing down high on her forehead . Jules wondered if she ever laughed . ' What was she like when she laughed ? He felt lust rise in him , a desire to get her alone , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to approach her again in the next few days . He could not imagine approaching her again at all . He stopped to put the picture in his pocket , but somehow it got loose . The wind snatched it away . Jules lunged for it but it was blown over the railing . " Jesus . Shit , " he said in surprise . He watched it being blown rather languidly down and across the street , above the tops of trucks and cars . He ran to the stairs and slid down the embankment to the street and right down through the mud , and only a few feet away a police car sped past him . It passed him at maybe eighty miles an hour . Good luck . They must be after someone . Jules looked around for the picture  --  it was just coming to rest . There was an opening in the traffic ; he calculated and began edging out . Someone honked angrily at him . He jumped back onto the curb , which was not exactly a curb but only a raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here on foot ; it was against the law . Jules waited . The wind made his eyes burn . His face too was burning , with shame and exasperation , but still he would not give up , he 'd set his vision now upon a small white piece of paper that was fluttering on the other side of the street , lifting and falling violently as cars passed . He edged over again , waited until a car sped by , then ran blindly across the street . Someone put on his brakes and a terrible honking began . Jules waved them away and jumped to the other curb . he snatched up the piece of paper but it was not the photograph . " What ? " he said aloud . He threw it back over his shoulder in disgust . Then he saw another piece of paper . This had landed in the near lane a few yards away and was already crumpled . He ran over and picked it up . Edith Kamensky with her pale , pale lashes .. . For a while he stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muddy embankment , staring at the photograph . It was dirty , it had been bent in two . Weariness rose in him , a sense of wonder . There was always something about life he could not figure out . Now that he had retrieved it , he thought , he had to be faithful to it.  |p151She  was fourteen . She sat in the kitchen at the table while her mother 's friend Ethel combed out her wet hair and rubbed hair-set lotion on it . The lotion was green and had a peppermintsmell ; Maureen liked that smell . Loretta sat across from them , her chair turned outward , her legs crossed . The two women were smoking . Loretta said , " The boss is n't so bad . I like that car of hers  --  that red car , you seen it ? " Ethel was putting one strand of Maureen 's hair onto a big pink plastic roller . She said with a preoccupied air , " She took me for a ride in it one day . No , she ai n't so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . I 'd rather have a man boss . And Dora May , that little suck , she runs and tells her if anyone leaves early . The other day I got finished with my customer at four-thirty , so why the hell not leave ? So I left , and the next morning . . . " It was summer now and Maureen 's father had been dead for months . She did not miss her father . Sometimes she began to cry when she was alone , crying for no reason ; but she did not think this had anything to do with her father . It had to do with Ford Hospitaland all the corridors and all the people , every one of them helplessas her father . It had to do with the cemetery . It had to do with her brother , who stayed away from home most of the time now . All these changes , this geography of change , she could not keep up with . So she sometimes cried when she was alone . In front of other people she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice lady , " Loretta said . " She came back speciallyto me to give me a quarter . Was n't that nice of her ? " " Yeah , she 's nice . And Mrs. Abrahams is nice . But that Mrs. Freer or whatever her name is , she 's a bitch  --  she thinks she 's so glamorous but I got a surprise for her , if she ever asks my opinion . " Ethel was a lanky , energetic woman in her forties . She had taken a course at a local beauty school and worked at the La Marvel Beauty Salon on Vernor . Loretta , who had no training , worked there also but could only wash hair and help clean up the place . She had worked there since the beginning of June . Suddenly her looks had changed ; she came home with her hair tinted a light airy blond , puffed out about her face , her eyebrows were arched in a new and important way , her nails were expertly done , without the half-moons showing ; she had a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgently between the thumb and forefinger , poised , always ready to be brought to her mouth . Maureen noticed that Ethel smoked the same way . Ethel had hair that was tinted red , set into heavy waves about her face , and she always wore certain colors that she thought went with red  --  brown , green , dark blue . She and Loretta leafed through magazines when they sat in the kitchen having coffee  --  Hair Design , Vogue , Salon 6 Boutique . They brought these magazines home from the La Marvel Beauty Salon and forgot to return them . Maureen had gone down to the salon one day just to see what it was like and had been a little depressed at the unclean front windows , but it was a job , it was something . Her mother seemed to like it . " I wish I could get myself to go take some course , some lessons , " Loretta said . She was watching the way Ethel did Maureen 's hair . " I 'd like to cut hair and all that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ? I would n't have any trouble setting it , it 's just cutting it that would scare me . " " Nothing to it , " Ethel said . " Next month I 'm going to get myself downtown to that place , what's-the-name , and see how fast I can get through . " Maureen touched her head . There were four large rollers set across the very top of her head , pulling her hair tight , but she did not want to complain . Ethel was working on the sides now . This had been Loretta 's idea : she 'd said , looking critically at Maureen a few days before , " You 'd better let Ethel fix you up . Them bangs do n't do much for you , kid . It looks like you bought them from the Fuller Brush man . " And now , on newspaper laid on the floor around her chair , lay snippings of her dark brown hair . The damp clipping scissors , brought home from the La Marvel , lay on the table with clots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hair spray and the rollers themselves had been smuggled home from the La Marvel . " How 's your mother-in-law ? " Ethel said . " You saw her . I do n't ask . " Grandma Wendall , though no better , had taken over the livingroom . Maureen did not know how this had come about . Gradually the old lady had taken over the sofa , half lying there with a quilt over her knees , watching television . She woke up every morning atp153six . They heard her in the kitchen , making herself breakfast , and when they got up , her breakfast dishes were all in the sink , soaking , and Grandma Wendall herself was in the living-room with the televisionset turned on rather loudly , watching the " Today " show . The blinds were drawn down so that there was no glare on the screen . When she wanted to go to the bathroom she called Loretta , if Loretta was home , or Maureen , if Maureen was home , or Betty , and , leaning heavily upon their shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed heavier than before , though she was not well . She ate a lot of ice cream . Her hair was frizzled and white , very thin , and her face was a mass of wrinkles . Still , there was a certain youthful antagonism about her . Right now , at ninethirtyin the evening , she was on the sofa with the room darkened , watching a television program ; Maureen could hear the artificial applause and laughter roaring out of the darkened front room . In the kitchen the two women were strangely silent . " Well , " Ethel said slowly , " it was like that with my ma too  --  I mean she had her mother-in-law with her . For thirty years . How 'd you like that , kid ? " " Jesus Christ , " Loretta said . " That old lady was batty all her life . I swear , her brains were scrambled or something . She come over from Czechoslovakia when she was seventeen years old and never bothered to learn English . Said it was too much trouble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be eighty and never knew anything , I mean not one thing ; she never knew about the Second World War or Hitler or anything , it was just crazy . She was n't a bad old dame , but how 'd you like that , Loretta ? " " Jesus Christ , no . " " We lived over on Lycaste then . " Maureen sat obediently , bending her head . Ethel finished anotherrow of rollers . She fixed them with steel clips . Then she lifted the can of hair spray and sprayed Maureen 's head all around for quite a while . " God , that stuff stinks , " Loretta said . " This stuff is nothing . At work we got a real strong mixture , not like this , " Ethel said . " It comes out of a gun like , you seen it ? God , is that strong ! I got a coating of it in my lungs , I bet . It makes mep154want to puke . For four years I been using it , and what you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , I bet they are n't . " Now Ethel combed Maureen 's bangs down flat on her forehead and fixed them there with a strip of Scotch tape . " Bring the hair drier in and get that hair all dry . You do n't go to bed with wet hair , " Loretta said . They hooked the hair drier up , and Maureen sat holding it in her hand ; it was a hand model , bought for under ten dollars . She liked the warm air blowing against her head . The kind of tears it brought to her eyes were innocent tears , without pain . It was like when she yawned . It was not like the bitter tears that surprised her , coming upon her with such power ; sometimes in the library , back in the stacks of books , she found herself beginning to cry in a passionof shame , not understanding . Her mother rarely cried now and her sister never cried . And Jules , who had cried only a few times in her memory , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had flunked his sophomore year of high school and had said he was n't going back . The two women drank coffee and talked now , evasively and quietly , of someone Maureen did n't know . She gathered that she was not supposed to listen . A woman who 'd gotten in trouble and her husband kicked her out , and . . . Maureen thought about Jules . She felt safe between these two women , her mother and her mother 's friend , oddly safe in their intimate , gossipy warmth ; let them talk about anything , anything ! At such times she could think about her father or about Jules or about nightmare things that would ordinarily frighten her  --  for instance , a girl dragged into a car not two blocks away and raped and pushed out the door , endingup half dead , and the girl was someone Maureen knew . Jules had started to stay out overnight back in April . He told Loretta lie was staying at a friend 's house , spending the night . He gave them a name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name or made a telephone call , and gradually Jules began staying away two or three nights a week . Maureen heard from other kids that he was cutting school . But what he did during the day , whether he had another job or spent his time roaming around , whether he was getting inp155trouble , no one knew . He told Maureen , " Those kids at school get next to me , they 're so goddam dumb . They 're little people . I ca n't stand them . " The boys he had hung around with for years were dumb now and he avoided them . If he had new friends , Maureen did not know who they were . One night when Maureen asked him what was wrong , did n't he like her and Ma and Betty any more , he had said impatiently , " It 's this house I ca n't stand . I ca n't stand this dump . I come in the front door and keep thinking I 'm going to see him there . . . . Insteadit 's always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear him drive into the driveway . Or hear him get up in the middle of the night and go to the bathroom . There 's too much left over of him here , I ca n't stand it . " " She had it done three times , I bet you . There was three separatetimes , " Ethel said . " Would n't you think she 'd learn ? Jesus ! " Loretta laughed . " How 's that what's-her-name , Connie ? She still come around here ? " " She 's got a place in Highland Park . She got a job doing something , do n't ask me what , you 'd think it was some big secret or something the way she talks . Actually , Maureen and I think she 's a waitress . ' What else could that cow do ? Yeah , she comes around sometimes . Her and the old lady sit in the front room and if you walk in they give you the fish eye , like it was their goddam house . Connie must weigh two hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Mass and has the goddammest lace thing , black lace , draped over her head like some Spanish bull or cow or something . The two of them keep whispering in the living-room , gabbingtheir heads off . I know they 're talking about me but I do n't give a goddam . Let them . If I did n't have a job I 'd go crazy with that old bag 's stink and her crap and that television set on all the time , but look , I figure it this way : when the television breaks clown next time I 'm not going to bother fixing it , but until then she might as well watch it . Why not ? She would n't be a bad personif she 'd just let up once in a while . I mean , I can remember when we were all out on that god-awful farm , in the country , and she was a lot younger and did all kinds of things  --  oh , she made bread and noodles and did a lot of canning , she worked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a different person . Now her face is always set the same way . Like a bomb . She looks like a bomb . But I do n't like to speak bad of her because ... " Because she 's going to die soon , Maureen thought . " Because she was Howard 's mother , you know , " Loretta said lamely . " Yeah , I know . Like I told you , my own ma had the same problem . For thirty years . " " Your mother must have been a saint . " " Yeah , she was sort of a saint , now I think about it . All us kids think she was real good . I wish I had n't given her so much trou-ble  --  " " Trouble ! Jesus Christ , there 's nobody that does n't have trou-ble . " Loretta fixed her eyes on Maureen . She was beginning to look at Maureen in a certain way now , seriously and thoughtfully . This had begun a few months back , when Maureen had turned fourteen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and Maureenhad been uneasy at her words . " Yeah , that 's a fact . That 's a sure thing , " Ethel said . " In the front room I got trouble , when Howard was alive I had trouble , back living with my father I had trouble  --  one thing after another , all my life . But I do n't let it get me down . " " You sure do n't . You look real good , Loretta . " " Oh , the hell with that , " Loretta said , pleased , brushing this compliment away with a wave of her hand . " I 'm just not going to let them get me down . The guy came about the water meter and said somebody broke it , some kids . I said , well that ai n't my fault . He said it had n't better be broke again . I said , go next door , it 's their water meter too , ai n't it ? I tell you , Ethel , every half-assed bastard comes down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard time . He said , are you Mrs. Howard Wendall and ai n't this Labrosse Street ? I told him have a look at the street sign if he could read . I told him none of my kids broke that meter and he could go to hell if he thought I 'd pay for it . " " Yeah , they always try to push you around . They got a badge orsomething and come in a truck , think they can push you around . " " I 'm telling you nobody is going to push me around . Just be/cause I 'm a widow . Now , this one cop , this Italian what's-his-name , he gives Jules a hard time and for no reason whatsoever . What 's his name , Reeny ? " " Joe Mattuizzo . " " Yeah , him . His kid brother used to be a friend of Jules . He picked Jules up in the squad car last week , or two weeks ago , andJules was doing nothing , not one thing . Him and the other cop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street and looking for kids with knives or dope . Jules do n't have even a knife , what the hell would he want a knife for ? Anyway they had to let him go . When I saw that bastard the next day , hanging around by the cornor , I told him , go feel up some nigger and leave my kid alone ! He tried to act real polite but I told him he 'd be sorry if he botheredmy kids , to remember that . " " He was n't the one , about Betty ? " " No , that was some old cop , that was n't a bad old guy , " Loretta said . Her face took on a slightly irritated look , and Maureen knew that Ethel had done wrong to bring up this subject . " No , he was nice . He understood . He just brought her home and talked to me . I gave him some coffee . He was a real gentleman and not like that bastard Mattuizzo or whatever the hell his name is . " Betty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught with a gang of kids who were breaking into cars parked near Tiger Stadium . It had been the afternoon of a baseball game and all the parking lots and even the front and side yards of private homes had been filled with cars . No charges had been made against her . Lorettahad wept about it for an evening and had finally slapped Betty around , and that was the end of it . It had n't been mentioned again . " But I 'm telling you they ai n't going to get me down , " Loretta said angrily . " There 's not enough bastards in this city to get me clown for long . " ' The one job Maureen 's grandmother was supposed to do was the ironing ; that had been her own idea . While Loretta was gone duringthe day she was supposed to iron , sitting out in the kitchen with the ironing board stretched between two chairs so that she could reach it . On the kitchen counter was a radio that playedp158continuously , little fifteen-minute stories . But she usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , giving in , feeling the surface of her skin rise in tiny prickles at being so weak . When Loretta came home from work she would say , " Oh , I see you got the ironing done , Ma , thank you , " but her grandmother never spoke up to say that Maureen had done the work . " I hate her ! I wish she 'd go away , " Maureen whispered to Betty . " They should come and take her away and throw away the key , " Betty said . Part of Loretta 's new life was a certain fast rollicking blindness ; she did not seem to see what was going on . She was in a hurry . She came in the house and changed her clothes , she went down to the drugstore , she went shopping just before the grocery store closed , she went out to the movies with Ethel or other " girls " who worked at the beauty parlor , she went bowling with them , she was always in a hurry and seemed to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ludicrously formal . She said , " Reeny is going to do the kitchen and the bathroom this morning , Ma , and we would both appreciate it very much if you did n't walk on the floor . So if you want to go to the bathroom maybe you could go now . I 'll help you in . " She appeared in the kitchen in her slip , the odor of sweat and perfume about her , the straps of her slip fixed with safety pins and its skirt tight about her thighs so that you could see where her stockings were fastened . She often hummed to herself . When she complained about her low pay at the La Marvel it was not real serious complaining but a kind of song , another kind of humming . When Maureen tried to explain things to her , why she needed a new skirt or fifteen cents for the Red Cross Drive at school , Loretta often did n't hear her . Or she said , " Blah-blah-blah . " She developed a habit of standing with her hands at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disbelieving smile . Perhaps she listened to the wild stories of the other beauty-parlor operators with that same smile . Perhaps she listened to the wild stories of her customers with that smile . Sometimes when she came home late , having been out at a movie or bowling or maybe at a bar , she 'd wake Maureen and Betty and give them a bag of pretzels ! Other times she woke them up to complain about something . Why was the house so dirty ? Whyp159could n't that big dope Maureen keep things cleaner ? She was going to turn Betty over to the reformatory , the girls ' jail , yes , she was  --  and Betty , with her wise , crinkled eyes and her tough skin , would watch her mother with that exact disbelieving smile , her mother 's smile . Sometimes Loretta sailed into the house with her hair newly done and her face all fixed up , an almost-pretty woman with a slightly sullen , perplexed forehead , and announced that she was going out for dinner and would Maureen please take over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The more Loretta was away , the more powerful Grandma Wendallbecame . Maureen had to run down to the drugstore for her . She had to telephone the clinic to report her grandmother 's new symptoms . She had to go next door to tell Flora Stonewall that her grandmother would like to borrow some cocoa to make hot chocolate . If she went outside to get away , just hanging around the front veranda with a girl friend , her grandmother lay in the living-room and called , " Maureen ! Maureen ! " in a voice of pain . In the summershe played parcheesi with a girl in the neighborhood and the games were always interrupted . Under her breath she murmured , " Oh , hell , " as she ran back into the house , thinking , What next ? What 's she want now ? And it was always something surprising , something she would not have imagined . One morning after Loretta left for work Grandma Wendall began talking about her . " You know she 's running around with every man she can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoved her chair back from the table . " Oh , yes she is ! You think your grandmother is lying ? Making things up ? I sit in this house and I do n't go out but I know everything that 's going on . I know everything . I can look right out the window , through the side of the window , through the side of the shade , and nobody knows I can see what 's going on but I can . I know all about that little girl friend of yours , Maureen  --  that girl with the bad skin and the oily hair , her . I know all about her . And I can hear you talking . I can hear everything you say . " Maureen looked away . " She 's just making it up , " Betty said . " I can hear everything . I can see everything . And when your ma comes home it ai n't alone . I see them out front on the street , in thep60car  --  I know , I 'm watching . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'm not asleep . I know just when she comes in and I know everything about her . She does n't fool me  --  " " You 're crazy , " Betty said . " Do n't you talk like that to me , you little jailbird ! " " I 'm not no jailbird , " Betty said in a whine . " I never got arrested once ! Do n't you call me that ! " " I can hear everything they say . Oh , your ma says all kinds of things , she 's got no shame . She tells them men anything they want to hear . I would n't tell you girls what it is . She talks about meeting them the next night , she makes promises  --  them men are probably married and just running around with her for the hell of it , to see what they can get out of her , and she 's so dumb she thinks they 'd marry her . Well , nobody 's going to marry her , with her hair all bleached like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roosters with the blond feathers on top . " " I think Ma looks nice , " Maureen said . " I do too , " said Betty . Their grandmother pushed herself up from the table . She was stooped over but still fairly tall ; what had been muscles hung in folds from her arms , visible through the overlarge armholes of her cotton dress . There was an odor of unwashed flesh about her . Really , she was a very dirty woman ; she did not like to wash . She was so hawkish with her sharp eyes and mouth that Loretta did not dare to mention it . " You just like to talk back , you two . One with a long face and the other a jailbird  --  " " Betty was never in jail , " Maureen said . " I never even got arrested , " Betty said again . " You will , " the old woman said . " I do n't care if I do ! I can take care of myself . I ai n't no crazy old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a boy 's shirt and she was barefoot . She and her grandmother stared at each other , nearly the same height . Betty snickered like a boy . " One of you two help me now  --  I got to go in the bathroom . " Maureen went obediently to her grandmother and helped her walk . The old lady leaned upon her . She said , " You would n't stand around telling your grandmother to go to hell if your father wasp161still alive . You 'd see what was what then . Or if your mother did n't run around with every man she could find , anything in pants  --  " " Shut up , " Betty said. "  --  if she did n't stay out all hours of the night running around in cars and getting drunk ! " Maureen went to open the bathroom door , but Betty got there before her . She slammed the door to and held onto the knob . " Do n't let the old bag in ! You 're always letting her boss you around ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! She 's all dirty anyway , the old bag , the old bitch ! Or let her go out in the yard like the dogs , shove her out here , here ! " Betty opened the back door wide . She was shouting . " Come on ! Shove her out the back door ! She ai n't no better than a dog ! Come on , Maureen ! Let go of her ! " " Betty , are you crazy ? " " I had enough , I ai n't taking any more ! She ai n't going to push me around , let me tell you ! This door is standing wide open and she can climb right down the steps here and do her business in the back yard , she thinks she 's so smart . Come on ! Come on ! " While their grandmother cried out , Maureen and Betty struggledover her . Betty seized the old woman 's wrist and began yankingher toward the door . Maureen pulled her back . She was amazed and yet there was something funny about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmother 's sudden weakness . The old woman was really weak . She had no strength . Betty yanked her forward and Maureen had to let go . " Now go outside ! Go on ! You do what I tell you ' cause I am now your boss ! " Betty screamed . When the old lady grabbed hold of the door frame , Betty raised her foot and brought her knee back , like a man , and gave her a hard solid kick right in the small of the back. ' l'he old woman fell forward onto the top of the back steps , then over the steps and down a few yards to the ground . ' I'hey looked down at her . She lay writhing in silence . " Come on , get up ! You ai n't hurt ! " Betty screamed . The old woman 's silence terrified them . Maureen could not move . " She 's just pretending , she fell on purpose ! You saw her fall onp162purpose ! " Betty said . " I ai n't taking nothing more from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me around ! Let her lay there and die ! Let her ! You saw yourself she fell on purpose to get me put in jail ! You saw it ! " That September , Maureen was elected secretary for her homeroom . During homeroom meetings she had to sit at the table at the front of the big room , beside the president . She had to take careful notes . In her slanted tiny handwriting she took everything down , anxious not to miss anything ; she sat hunched over , writing , while the boy who was president , in a frightened , faltering voice , tried to conduct meetings , and Sister Mary Paul , their homeroom teacher , looked sternly around the room to see that nothing was going on . Sometimes things did go on , not during meetings but outside or in the corridors  --  Maureen tried not to know about them . In the yard at noon hour boys said certain things to girls  --  it was better not to hear . After school , on the long walk home , she and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were careful which way they walked . Passing by an old warehouse one afternoon Maureen had seen an old man waving to her , and she 'd known enough to stay away , to hurry away . Some of the girls told wild stories . Carol 's mother told wild stories . Maureen tried not to listen , her face burning , everything in her confused . Carol 's mother trapped her and Carol sometimes and made them listen . Everything about her was strange : greasy , mussed hair . already gray , a slovenly , smelly body , a very shiny , hard-lookiin face . She told Maureen and Carol about certain things , talking rap idly and angrily , without looking at them ; Carol would stand in an agony of embarrassment , a heavy-set , worried , plain girl in a soiled school uniform of blue jumper and white blouse ; Maureen , a little more polite , would nod yes , yes , to Carol 's mother 's warnings about how girls should never go into cellars or dark places , never sitp163on toilet seats in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or hang around anywhere , or wash their hair during that time of the month  --  or else they would get very sick and everyone would know why  --  and did they know how easy it was to get pregnant and have a baby ? Maureen was afraid of Carol 's mother , yet she did not try to back away ; she remained polite and listening while Carol shifted her weight from foot to foot , ready to cry . Around school they said that Carol 's mother was crazy . Carol herself never talked about it . Maureen felt a dizzy , dangerous sensation , unable to move away as the woman came closer to her , always talking , muttering warnings , warnings ; it was clear that this woman knew everything about life that was ugly and this knowledge obsessed her . It weighed her down . It seemed to be bulging out of her , making her talk so fast . Knowing such things had made her sick . Once she put her hand on the back of Maureen 's neck and said angrily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where 'd he get that car ? How old is lie ? He thinks he 's pretty good , eh ? I saw him with a woman the other day right out on Michigan , walking along . A woman . Who is that woman ? Does your mother know what 's going on ? Or ca n't she handle him ? " Maureen stammered , " I do n't know . . . anything about it . " Every Friday , Sister Mary Paul 's homeroom had a " meeting . " At this time Maureen became the " secretary , " and rose shyly from her desk to come to the front of the room . She was very proud of her job . The rest of the week was confusing , and on her way home anything might happen and at home anything might happen , but being a secretary , having a special job , was safe . And she had the idea that this would give her experience so that she could become a secretary after high school . Her mother had liked that idea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by herself . At the start of the meeting the president would ask her to read the minutes of the previous meeting . She would read them slowly and carefully . The secretary 's official notebook was a plain one with a blue cover and lined pages with wide margins . On the front was a sticker that said Room 202 . SECRETARY 'S MINUTES . Sister Mary Paul , a massive woman in her fifties , taught Maureen exactly how to take down the notes . It was an important responsibility , beingp164homeroom secretary . Sister , sitting at her desk with her eyes closed , told Maureen what to do , very serious , nodding as she spoke . First of all , no ballpoint pen . A fountain pen only . Dark-blue ink only , not light blue ink or black ink . That was important . Every line had to be blotted carefully . The blotter should be clean . The minutes had to be written out on an ordinary piece of paper , handed in on Monday morning to Sister Mary Paul for checking , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word had to be written slowly and carefully . No word could be crossed out : if a mistake was made it would have to be erased . And it was difficult to erase dark-blue ink . Maureen was terrified each time she had to copy the minutes into the blue book . What if she dropped a big blot of ink . . . ? She had so much to do that her mind was a little confused . The secretary 's job was the most important thing in her life , but there were many other things she had to do . She had to get up early , while her mother slept , and get breakfast and start the coffee . Lorettawas often out late because she had quit her job at the La Marvel Beauty Salon and now worked at the Checker Grill , which was on Michigan Avenue a couple of miles away . The pay was better and the tips were better . People were lively there , Loretta said . But the work tired her out and she had to sleep late , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get Betty up , and sometimes Betty was mean in the mornings . She had to rinse the breakfast dishes ; if she let cereal dry on a dish it was hard to get off and her mother would give her hell . She had to sweep the house when she came home from school and on certain days clean the floors , especially the kitchen floor , which got sticky , and she had to start supper because Loretta was always out at that time of day . On Saturdays she did the laundry and the rest of the week she did the ironing , depending on how fast things were needed . Sometimes Loretta hugged her and said , " That 's my good girl , you 're a great kid ! " And sometimes she was in a hurry , stomping around in her high heels and looking for a blouse or something , and she might say , irritated , " You mean that blouse is still in the basket ? On Wednesday , still in the basket ? " She wrote out the secretary 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book might get soiled or rumpled.  |p165One  day her mother paused and came over to sit by her . It was a Saturday . She put her hand fondly on Maureen 's shoulder . Maureenwondered what was wrong . Was Loretta drunk at this time of day ? Her hair was done up in pink plastic curlers . She smelled of bath powder . " Well , you 're getting grown up , huh ? " Loretta said , confidential . " You and I have got to have a talk one of these days . Jesus , the years go fast ! And that brat Betty , she 's getting big for her age  --  where is she always running off to ? Who does she hang around with ? " " Oh , a few kids . I do n't know . " But Loretta forgot about Betty . Betty with her muscular legs was in and out of the house , bumping into things , and it was always better when she was gone , so why should Loretta nag her into stayinghome ? Loretta stared at Maureen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew back slightly . There was silence for a few seconds , then Loretta said , reddening , " You . . . you better watch out for them boys , huh ? Boys ever fool around with you ? " " Ma , no . " " You tell the truth now . " " I said no , " Maureen said miserably . She stared down at her feet . Loretta tried to laugh . The moment grew unbearably warm . Finallyshe said with a pleasant harshness , " Kids your age never tell the truth . I do n't believe one word you say , kid ! " Maureen could not think of anything to say . She was very ashamed . " You want to ask me anything ? I mean , about anything  --  you know , " Loretta said . " No . " " Well ... " They sat for a while in silence . Loretta was picking the polish off one of her nails . She made a tsk-ing sound , as if the fingernail polishhad disappointed her . " You get bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , you always did keep to yourself . You got a lot of secrets for a kid your age , " Loretta said with a laugh , relieved , dismissing her.  |p166But  half an hour later she came out of the back bedroom and handed Maureen a sweater , one of her own . " Here . This is too small for me  --  how about you ? You want it ? Go ahead , take it . Try it on . " " Can I have it ? " Maureen said , surprised . " I said take it . Try it on . " She sat in her silky green kimono , her arms folded , watching Maureen . Maureen put the sweater on . Loretta said , " If you 'd stand up straight you 'd be all right . You 'll have a nice shape , but I might have to put a harness on you  --  you know what that is ? " Maureen stared at her . " A harness to make you stand straight , " Loretta said . " What . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm just kidding ! Ca n't you take a joke ? Always a long face ! Christ ! Are n't you going to thank me ? " " Thank you , Ma . " " Your face is n't bad for a kid your age . " Maureen turned away . " You tell me if any boys bother you or anything . Around school or anything . Okay ? " Maureen nodded . " If Jules was n't always bumming around . . . " Jules had quit school . He worked for a trucking outfit and had his own car , a 1950 Ford , and he came home to sleep only once or twice a week . Where he ate , who his friends were , where he stayed on the nights he did n't come home , Loretta did n't know . When she asked him he would say , " I get along all right , do n't worry , " and the conversation would drift off idly to something else . Loretta did not think that anything was going wrong because , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every week . He was a good kid . The only bad thing that had happened was back in August , when he 'd been picked up with some other boys and booked for something or other  --  burglary , trespassing , " suspicious behavior "  --  but he was let out in three days and nothing had come of it . Maybe they had lost the records . He 'd been in Children 's Shelter off and on , and once he had been kept there for a day and a night before Loretta had even known about it ; Jules had told them he was fromp167Toledo , a runaway . " Christ , what a crazy kid ! What an imagination ! " Loretta had cried . But those charges had been dropped and so Loretta forgot about them . There was so much for her to think about . For one thing , they had to move again . Now that Grandma Wendall was in a nursing home and gotten rid of , Loretta was able to do what she had always wanted : move into an apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running a house . It took too much of her time . The bathroom plumbing was always backing up , the furnace was always stinking up the rooms , everything was getting dirtier and dirtier and falling apart , and it was dangerous to live here now without a man . If only Jules did n't bum around so much , but you ca n't do anything with a kid that age . . . She found a corner apartment over a drugstore not far from the Cadillac plant . It was a better neighborhood , Loretta said . She liked it . She liked living in an apartment . It turned out that there were more cockroaches there than in the house , but Maureen kept saying that it was nice because Loretta seemed anxious to hear that it was nice  --  she wanted nice things  --  nice things !  --  after all the crap she 'd been through ! She deserved them . What she deserved was a vacation , or a fur coat , or a bigger televisionset , or some wonderful surprise  --  she did n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for the first time . She kept mentioning " Pat "  --  Maureen thought in the beginning " Pat " was a woman , then realized it was a man . " Pat knows the inside story on that , the Mayor 's kid , " she would say . Or , " Pat said that fire was really caused on purpose , the owner is a Jew , he collected a million in insurance . " Maureen and Betty exchanged looks but Loretta never explained . It was part of her new fluttery style to talk fast , excitedly . At school Maureen thought with dread , " Who is Pat ? " She ran into her brother one afternoon on the street . He was wearing a dark trench coat ; he looked handsome . Broken away from home , he must have been , at last , free at last , to look so handsome on the street ! She tugged at his arm , overjoyed at seeing him . " Honey , I 'm in a hurry , I 'm going in here to get some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty.  |p168Maureen  looked around in disappointment . She saw a car at the curb , not Jules 's old car , and in the car was a woman with very short blond hair , cut straight across her forehead and across her ears . She had a boyish , cold look . She looked at Maureen but her face showed nothing . " Jules , there 's some guy Ma is going with  --  his name is Pat . You know anything about it ? " " I 'm in a hurry  --  " " When are you coming home ? What 's wrong ? You ever heard of this guy Pat ? " " It 's just some guy . He 's all right . " " You know him ? " " He 's all right . " He pulled away from her gently and went into the drugstore . Maureen followed him . " Do n't you like us at home any more ? " she said . " Do you have your own place now ? " " I 'm doing all right . " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like you . " " You 're never going back to school ? " " I 'm through with that crap . " " Are n't you going to visit us , Jules ? Why not ? I do n't like the place we live in now . I ca n't sleep . I keep thinking we 're somewhere else  --  I get mixed up . I keep thinking I hear Pa walking around , you know , like when he would get up to go to the bathroomat night . Why did Ma want to move ? " " You 're better off where you are . " " Do n't you like me any more , Jules ? " " Hey , do you need any money ? " " I do n't want money ! " Maureen cried . Jules turned from her , annoyed . She was talking too loudly . He went to the counter and bought some cigarettes . Maureen stared at his back , something was happening , something terrible  --  she was losing Jules or had already lost him . . . was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back she said politely , " Yes , I could use some money . Can I borrow a dollar ? " " Sure , sweetheart . " Jules smiled , relieved , and took out his wal/let . Maureen noted that it looked new . " Here , " he said , giving her three dollars , " go see a movie or something . Buy a dress . Be good . " " A dress for three dollars ? " Maureen laughed . He gave her another bill  --  a five-dollar bill . " Oh , Jules , thanks ! Thank you ! " They stared at each other , suddenly embarrassed . Jules put his wallet away . Maureen put the money in her army-surplus purse , a small boxlike purse of the kind all the girls had ; it had been used to store bullets , so they said . They left the drugstore . Maureen did not dare ask about the woman in the car . " Hey , how 's Ma these days ? " Jules asked , backing off . " Real good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , the same . " " Grandma ? " " I guess the same . " " Take care of yourself , kid ! " Maureen did not look toward the woman in the car . She felt as if she were in some peculiar danger , yet not knowing what the danger was . In Jules 's nervous , cheerful manner there was something that frightened her . It was on her way home that afternoon that she realized she had lost the secretary 's notebook . It was gone . And why was she bringingit home , what had she been thinking of ? The notebook with the blue cover , the official notebook . . . . Minutes had gone back to 1953 in that book , recorded by other secretaries ; Maureen had lost it . She had been carrying several books and the notebook , but now the notebook was gone . She kept looking through the books again and again . She found nothing . In a panic she ran back to the drugstore . She looked inside . She looked out on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been bringing the notebook home ? She could not think . She hurriedback toward school , her heart thudding . The blue notebook was so real to her that she kept thinking she saw it , in a doorway , in an alley , in the gutter . . . she was going crazy , seeing it when it was n't there , her eyes beginning to water . . . . But how could she have lost it ? She must have left it in school.  |p170She  set her books down on the curb . She looked through them again . Her fingers were trembling . It 's got to be here , she thought . A few people passed her . They glanced down at the girl in the nuns ' school outfit , her coat undone , her hair thick and blown about her face in the air of that wide , windy , evil Michigan Avenue ; a girl going through the worst experience of her life . They glanced at her and glanced away . It seemed to Maureen that her life was coming undone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was losing her mind , she was coming undone , unfastened . It was like that time her period had begun in school , a hot flow of blood , a terrible sickening surprise yet not really a surprise , and she 'd gone in the girls ' room and , trembling , nearly in a convulsion , she had tried to fix herself up but had n't been able to think of what to do , only that blood was coming out of her and would not stop , and she felt in the presence of Carol 's mother . . . the heavy winking ugly wisdom of the insane , knowing everything , prepared for everything , no surprise so sickening it ca n't be mastered with a lopsided grin . . . . It would be the end if she started to cry . So she picked up her books and ran back toward school . She crossed a vacant lot she had crossed earlier . Papers and junk everywhere but no blue notebook . She looked along the path , kicking things aside : nothing . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspended terror and looked around at the buildings all around her , used-up , withoutfeatures , the empty buildings of grownups that told her nothing : Michaelson Brothers Towel Service , Lenox Photographs , DetroitFurniture and Refrigerator Resale . The wind blew tiny bits ofdirt against her . Her eyes watered . She thought again of Jules , who had driven away , and of Carol 's mother , and of Room 202 and Sister Mary Paul . Sister 's face knew everything . Maureen 's life was in her keeping . Maureen was guilty and never , never would she be forgiven , there was no way out , no escape , no help  --  oh , she would give up everything , give up her mother , her brother , her own life just to be innocent again , to have things back the way they were at two-thirty that afternoon ! Out of breath , crying , she reached the school . Sister Mary Paul was still in her room . She was disgusted . " Go look for it , " she told Maureen . Maureen ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concrete yard , though she knew the notebook could not be there ;  |p171but  perhaps Sister was watching from a window . She looked around by the fence , all along the fence : nothing . She looked in a pile of trash . The yard was empty . The walls were dirty with scrawled words , half mysterious and forbidden . Maureen usually did not look at those words but today she stood staring at them dully . No one else was in the yard . Everything was over , finished  --  the future was finished . The wind , high above the old church steeple , was making a curious hollow noise . Maureen could not think what to do . She hardly knew what to think , what to occupy her mind with . Finally she retraced her steps to the corner where she 'd met Jules . Maybe he had seen it ? Maybe he had it ? She looked everywhere , everywhere . She walked back and forth on the sidewalk . Could the notebook already be at home ? Somehow at home ? Or had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notebook like the one that was lost ? But she could n't make up the old minutes , the many pages of minutes from other years  --  it was hopeless , a trap  --  discussions about paper cups , about who had taken someone 's mittens , all those minutes of old talk conducted in Room 202 , all of it lost , all of it her fault . She felt that her mind was coming undone . She ran back to school . Sister Mary Paul was at Mass , they said . It was already fourthirty . Maureen waited for her . " I could n't find it ! " she said , beginning to cry again . " Keep looking for it , " the nun said coldly . Maureen tried to seize the woman 's hands . " Please forgive me ! Forgive me ! I did n't mean to lose it  --  " " Go look for it . Keep looking . " She kept looking around on the street until it was dark . At home she wept . The next morning she got up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notebook , lost , a blue notebook , she had to find it . She thought of nothing else . Every morning of that week she had to report to Sister Mary Paul that she was still looking . Still looking . Sister Mary Paul said , " Keep looking . Those are important records . " The week passed slowly , in a dream . Maureen 's head ached constantly , she could not sleep ; she lay on her bed and wept , until Betty told her to shut up.  |p172One  day another nun stopped her in the corridor and said , " SisterMary Paul would never say anything herself , Maureen , but she 's very pleased with the way you 're looking for the book . Keep looking . " Maureen could have wept with gratitude . She wanted to kiss this nun 's hands . She kept looking , but she never found the notebook . Maureen was brushing her hair . She leaned toward the mirror with a critical look that was something like her mother 's . She had been ready for school for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had eaten breakfast an hour before and now the rest of them were eating , making noises at the table . She tried not to listen to them but their noises could not be shut out . At night she had to listen to them , she had to listen to his snoring . Once she had had to listen to her father 's snoring . She 'd had to listen to her grandmother 's snoring  --  raspy , choking , vicious gasps for air , hardly human . At night she slept and woke , slept and woke , dreaming while she slept that she was awake and terrified of never being able to sleep , hearing the noises of her family eternally , never being free . There were dark shadows under her eyes , reproachful marks . She contemplated herself in the mirror critically , hearing through her tentative reflection his voice rising out in the kitchen . " Guess I 'll go down to the garage today , " he was saying . " See what 's up . There 's ... " Maureen did not call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she did not call him " Pat . " There was nothing at all to call him . Loretta said she should call him " Dad " but Maureen had said nothing , having nothing to say . Betty called him that guy behind his back . When Maureen went out he was still sitting at the kitchen table , which was pushed into a corner . His shirt was off . His chest , broad and yet a little sunken , covered with thick curly gray hair , rose and fell as he breathed ; he was drinking coffee noisily . He held the cup in both hands . Loretta stood behind him idly massaging his back.  | " Do n't you go lifting anything , somebody wants a hand , " Lorettasaid . " You got to get over this trouble . A slipped disk would be terrible . " " A what ? " said Furlong . " A slipped disk , something in the spine . Men get it from lifting heavy things . " She glanced at Maureen . Her face was pursed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the goddam cold weather do n't do it any good , " Furlong said . His back was " acting up . " When it had been better  --  a few months before , Maureen gathered  --  he had driven a truck . He belonged to the Teamsters Union . But now he just messed around at a garage where some friends of his worked , though that kind of work was n't good enough for him . He had a lot of time on his hands . He seemed to examine his hands often , seeing them empty , puzzled and a little angry , a big man getting fat . As soon as his back got well , he was always saying , he 'd be on the road again and making good money . Betty , who said she hated him , was crowding around him this morning . She was asking him about trucks . About fights . What did he think of Rocky Marciano ? ( Rocky Marciano was one of Betty 's heroes ; she had a picture of him taped up in her room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever handle a gun ? Were n't there shootingssometimes ? Was n't a truck driver killed just the other day ? He knew all about it , did n't he , the inside story ? A truck driver who had n't belonged to a union had been killed driving to East Lansing ; a large piece of scrap metal had been knocked off an overpass and through his windshield . The News had a big picture story about it . Did n't Furlong know all about it , know who had done the job ? He rubbed his hand hard over Betty 's head , as if she were a boy , a kid who bothered him and yet pleased him . Betty tried not to wince with pain . " Sorry , kid , " Furlong said , " that 's secret stuff . " He turned to Maureen , smiling . " Well , " he said awkwardly and yet with the same bossy smile he used on Betty , " well , where are you going ? Out to Hollywood to get in the movies ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Maureen said . She tried not to look at him ; his foolish teasing made her miserable . " That old jumper 's been around for years . Reeny 's worn it top174school for years , " Loretta said , her voice high-pitched and surprised . She let her arms slide across Furlong 's chest and she looked at Maureen over his head with a certain tenderness . " The nuns make them wear it . You know . " " I was n't kidding or anything , I think it looks nice . You had breakfast yet , Maureen ? " He was trying to be friends . " Yes . I 'm going . " He had a thick , muscular body , and because he was so often without his shirt  --  either in his undershirt or with his chest bare  --  Maureen mixed up the graying , matted hair on his chest with his face . She had a confused idea of him as hairy , with curly hair like shavings , very stiff , gray , unreal . But his face was always shaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like his body , looked hard and muscular ; his curly hair was clipped short up the back of his head , very neat ; his nose was small but clearly defined , because the nostrils were so large and dark . Tiny hairs emerged from them , just visible . Maureen supposed he was a man women would call handsome . But when she had to pass near him she could smell the smell that was always with him  --  not just dirt and grime and grease but the personal , private smell of his body . She did not remember her father smelling like that  --  he had had an odor of tobacco mostly . She did not think this man was handsome . She hated him . In her daydreams she imagined him dying as her father had died , crushed by metal . Hot metal . Deaths of men had to be brutal , the death of tons of metal cracking through ribs , through skulls , because the men themselves were so brutal . Even their breathing was brutal . Their snoring was brutal . Hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day , their eating and their talking , the way they sat at the table , were brutal . Furlong was always teasing her , half teasing her . Trying to be friends , with those blunt thick fingers and those dirty nails . Sometimes , at Mass , Maureen found herself thinking about him . She thought of a flashing movement she could not quite explain to herself , the falling of metal , somethingsharp . An artery severed . One arm crushed and mangled . An accident , an accident  --  once happened it can never be undone ! And with his chest bare , this man could withstand nothing , he was open , vulnerable , waiting  --  he would cry out in pain , calling forp175help , but no one could help him . A man on his way to death cannotbe helped . And she would come to herself , shaken and ashamed , and rememberthat she was in church and that she was happy for her mother : why should n't Loretta get married again and be happy ? " Hey , Reeny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " be sure you come right home today . " " I will . " " Do n't you go fooling around or anything , I need you hack home . " " Betty 's the one that fools around , " Maureen said with dignity . " Go to hell , " said Betty . " Just you come right home , Maureen , " said Loretta . " There 's all that ironing laying in the basket  --  " " I said I 'd come right home . " Maureen wanted to get out , but Loretta seemed to be hanging onto her . Loretta said in a high-pitched , critical , and yet not unpleasantvoice , " There 's a lot going on , so I hear . I hear lots of things . I do n't want you hanging around the five-and-ten or with that Carol what's-her-name , her mother is absolutely nuts . They found her in her slip running around outside in a storm , what d' ya think of that ? She said somebody was in the house , somebody was trying to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long way either , there 's too many smart-alecks on the lookout for kids like you . Her name was now Mrs. Furlong . She was no longer Mrs. Wendall . Maureen and Betty and Jules , though , were still Wendalls ; Maureen was glad of that . She thought it over and over , the meaning of her name . She thought about her mother 's new name , Mrs. Furlong , and she kept waiting for things to change , to straighten out and get quieter , but nothing happened . Nothing changed . Mrs. Furlong stayed with her job at the Checker Grill and Furlong went out most of the day , hanging around somewhere , making connections , catching up on news , telephoning people , doing who knows what , keeping himself busy , secretive . Then he came back home . " Carol 's mother is n't so bad , " Maureen said sullenly . " It 's somebody to live with . " " Yes , well , I did n't mean anything bad , " Loretta said , flutteryp176and feminine . " In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better stay away from them or people will think you 're nuts too . " " People think she 's nuts now , " Betty said loudly . " They do not , " said Loretta . " They think she 's stuck-up , she 's always got her nose in the air , She 's a real big deal . " Betty , trying to get Furlong to look at her , spoke brazenly . To show that she knew something none of them knew she ducked her head as if the impact of her knowledge was too much for her , a joke that was also terrible . " You , what do you know , " Maureen said contemptuously . She opened the door . Loretta said , " Remember what I said about coming home early , kid ? Okay ? " " Yes , Ma . Yes . " " I do n't like to see girls hanging around places like the five-andten , " Loretta said seriously , more to Furlong than to Maureen . " They 're just in there to pick up stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . If I ever caught Maureen stealing junk , like that . . . " Maureen sighed in exasperation . Maureen , always Maureen ! Why did n't her mother let her go ? " But she probably meets boys instead , " Loretta said . She was maybe trying to tease , affectionately ; maybe not . There was something bright and nervous about her this morning . The mention of Carol 's mother had done it , Maureen guessed . She knew that Loretta 's father had died in the state hospital , that he 'd been crazy at the end , very bad , and that Loretta kept bringing it up somehow  --  when Maureen 's father had been alive he was sure to bring it up himself . " They 're all nuts in your family , " he had said . " I do n't meet boys , " Maureen said . She left . She did n't know whether to be hurt or angry or to forget about it . Her mother was always picking on her , and yet it was n't in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . It made her nervous , not exactly resentful . She could n't understand it . These days Loretta was not herself . She and Furlong had been married on the first of October and had gone away for four days , top177Chicago they said , and now it was October 25 and there was still a dizzying excitement to the air , something strange . What did marriagemean ? What was going on ? Was the marriage legal and permanent , or was he going to walk out one of these days ? Everything was busy , noisy . Maureen thought that life should be quiet and sensible , but there was always too much happening at their place . The apartment was too small . Wash and ironing and dishes lay about until Maureen put them away . Clothes lay about . Towels , sheets , boxes of cereal carelessly closed , knives with food stuck to them , Furlong 's shoes , Betty 's junk  --  everything lay around , waiting to be taken care of by Maureen . Sometimes Furlong had friends of his over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early in the morning . Betty stayed out until late . Jules was always gone , never came to visit . Maureen would sit in her room , trying to do schoolwork . She shut her ears against the noise from the kitchen or from the television set or from Loretta and Furlong arguing or fooling around or laughing together , two big kids , two fools . It was harder and harder for her to do her homework . Since moving to this apartment she had n't been able to sleep right  --  she slept part of the night , but not well . She kept waking . Her heart seemed to flutter , as if it had heard something she had n't . It took her an hour to do a page of math homework , sometimes more than an hour , sitting with her hands pressed over her ears , staring at the book , trying to make sense of what she was reading . She was in the ninth grade now . Assignments seemed harder to her . Her mind seemed to work backward , strain backward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speck of dirt on the page distracted her , caught her eye again and again until in exasperation she would have to cover it up with her hand . She wanted to please her teacher  --  there seemed nothing more important to her now . But her mind seemed to resist . It wanted to break loose . Furlong 's friends stayed for hours , and at about two in the morning , when Loretta came home from work , no one bothered even to go and unlock the door for her , she had to unlock it herself . Maureen , lying sleepless and exhausted in her room , could hear all this but could not figure out exactly what it meant . Why was there always so much going on ? Maureen hurried outside . It was always good to leave the apart/ment . She walked to school alone now , walking fast . She could not think whether to be hurt or angry over Loretta 's teasing . " I suppose you got a secret boy friend , " Loretta was always saying . Lorettahad grown slightly thinner since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulderblades when she leaned forward in her green kimono . Her face had a pale , bluish look when there was no makeup on it , and sometimes she dropped things . The evening before she had dropped the scissors and Maureen had had to pick them up for her . " It makes me dizzy , bending over , " she had said . Maureen felt a peculiar tenderness toward her , partly resentful , partly protective . But she was measuring everything against the time when she would leave home , like Jules . She drifted down to the library whenever she was free . Growing up and moving away from home was somehow linked in her mind with the library  --  the library at night , its silence and openness . Anything might happen . Nothing happened but anything might . She sat at the long , shiny , empty tables , reading , leafing nervously through books , glancing up when someone came into the big reading-room , waiting . She liked to go to the library in the evenings , when her mother was out working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loretta were home she 'd never let Maureen out , so Maureenbegan to think that it was good her mother worked , it was good to be left alone . She leafed through magazines , curious and alert for what the rest of the world was doing . In a glossy magazine she came upon an advertisement for a paperweight , a small cat made of glass ; it sold for $500 and was " to hold down your important papers . " She sat staring at this advertisement for some time . She looked at what women were wearing , long-legged and sullen , their faces more beautiful than hers and remote , as if they were women from anotherplanet , speaking another language . She stared at these pictures , aware of having failed though she was still young ; her failure was tied up somehow with her being unable to sleep . She would not grow up into a normal woman : something would catch her and hold her back , some snag , some failure to have dreamed her way out of childhood . Most of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Asp179soon as she read the first page of a novel by Jane Austen she was pleased , startled , excited to know that this was real : the world of this novel was real . Her own life , up over Elson 's Drugs or back on Labrosse , could not be real . The birdlike chatter of her mother , Betty 's grunts and bad temper , the glimpse Maureen had to contentherself with of Jules out on the street were not so real as novels , not so convincing . There was nothing permanent about them , as there was about people in novels . And when her mother made those ugly accusations about Maureen meeting boys when she should be in school , how could that be real ? How could such words be real ? The rest of the day , the following night , were hardly enough for her thoughts . She was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours . Every moment had brought a fresh surprise ; and every surprise must be a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising on herself , and living under ! These words were real , and very real the person behind them . Maureen , dreaming over them , could feel herself begin to dissolve into nothing , nobody , an eye in a head , a blankness . The suffering of such a character in such a novel was much greater than her own . How could she or her people be raised to this level of suffering ? Grandma Wendall 's grunts and groans made her hated . Nobody felt sorry for her , not really . Nobody would ever cry over her as they would over the unhappiness of a woman in a novel . On Sundays , when they went to visit Grandma Wendall , Maureentook a book along for something to do . Often Aunt Connie came with them . Furlong drove them and let them off at the nursinghome , then went down the street to have a few beers while they climbed the steps and ascended through layer after layer of stale , disinfectant-stinking air , peering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aged woman after woman , all of them sisters in their soiled white nightgowns of flanneland their anxious , jealous eyes . Sometimes an old woman would creep out into the corridor to stare after them , fascinated by Loretta 's patent-leather high heels and Maureen 's long shiningp180hair , or angry about some fantastic wrong . " Come here and look , it 's filthy ! Not fit for people ! They come and do their business in the corner of my room , look at the roaches , little girl , come look ! " Maureen always kept going . " Them poor old things , " Loretta said , shaking her head . " It 's really awful when you get old . " It was a world of women : sick trays , skeletal hands , wet paper napkins . Maureen stared at the smooth , innocent curve of a skull beneath thin white hair . She felt very young , remote . But she also felt threatened . The crucifixes on the walls were the same as the one her mother had on the living-room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world outside of novels . Connie , in her broad-shouldered cloth coat and her Sunday hat , was always calm . Or perhaps she saw nothing . She led the way up to the fifth floor and to the old woman 's room , no nonsense about her , no lingering over elderly women in the corridors who wanted to register a complaint with the bishop . Maureen was both nervous and bored by these visits . She felt very young , even threatened . She hated to be stared at . In the room they always sat in the same place  --  Connie and Loretta on either side of the bed , Maureen on the window sill , half sitting and half standing . She was glad to be out of the way . Grandma Wendall looked very old . She did not look like the same woman . Her body , big beneath the bedclothes , had a stationary , welded look , as if nothing could move it . Maureentried to feel sorry for her but could not locate any sorrow . The odor of flesh and spilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They told you , eh , about my stroke ? Whole right side paralyzed , paralyzed ? " the old woman said to Maureen . She was alert and spiteful , not wanting Maureen to open that book and escape . " How is Jules ? Jules is my favorite ! " the old woman said . Connie and Loretta , who now saw each other only during these visits , faced the old woman with a certain strange enthusiasm . Climbing up the steps made them breathless , and this breathlessnessturned into a kind of anticipation . They began to talk . They talked to Grandma Wendall and to each other with ironic , womanly smiles , moving gradually into the areas of their real interests , gaining enthusiasm , momentum , as the minutes passed . Theyp180talked about work . Loretta was still a waitress and Connie worked in a laundry . They talked about religion , about the priests at their churches . They talked about the price of food , about the baby Lorettawas going to have ( yes , a new baby  --  due in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's apartment , the troubles on the street , the troubles in the city , Betty and her gang , Maureen herself ( " She 's got secrets of her own , like a sneaky cat , " Loretta said in Maureen 's hearing ) , and , finally , as if this were the target they 'd been circling , men . Furlong and his job . Furlong and his back . Furlong . Men . Connie 's boy friend Stan . His job . His ex-wife . His crazy ex-wife . Off to themselves , safe and lively , women always talked about men : their eyes and their voices seized hungrily upon men . After about an hour and a half of this , either Loretta or Connie would get to her feet and clap her hands lightly together in a confusedgesture of satisfaction at having seen Grandma Wendall and having found her " better . " But it was time to go ! Time to go , sorry . ' I ' hey had jobs the next day . . . " I woke up and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandma Wendall said bitterly . " How would you like that for yourself , you two ? Always strutting around ! " " Ma , what do you mean by that ? " Loretta cried , hurt . " You say hello to Jules for me . Do n't forget . Jules is my only favorite . " " Jules says he 'll be over to see you real soon , maybe next Sun-day . " " Does n't matter if he comes or not . I know him . He 's my only favorite . " Though they were anxious now to leave they always hung back . I , oretta might think of something more to say . Connie might think of something . Only Maureen , carefully marking her place in her book , would be ready to go , frightened and bitter at the old woman'spower even now . Some people , even in their dying , had power ; others never had power . " You say hello to Jules and to Betty and to what's-his-name  --  " " Ma , you know his name is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , what's-his-name ... " They found Furlong down the street in a bar . He had gotten top182know the bartender there . The three of them sat with him in a booth . After a few minutes Loretta and Connie would be weeping lightly , and Maureen would sit in idle misery , wishing it was light enough for her to read . Loretta would say , drowsily affectionate , her hand on Furlong 's arm , " Boy , she used to be something , that old gal ! Was n't she ? A real tough old gal ! Was n't she something , Connie ? " " Yeah , she was pretty tough . " " It 's hell to get old ... " After they dropped Connie off at her place Loretta would always say , shaking her head , " That poor dope ! It 'd make me sick , washingthe crap out of other people 's clothes . She can have it . " " Was n't she ever married ? " Furlong asked . " Yeah , but he run off . Left her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maureen asked . Loretta said nothing for a while . Then she said her face pinched , " What do you care ? It 's none of your business , you 're too young ! " " I feel sorry for Aunt Connie . " " Oh , hell , you do n't feel sorry for anybody ! " Maureen stared at her , hurt . She could not understand . Shc wondered if maybe her mother was talking to the real Maureen , a girl who was hypocritical and selfish and sly . Was that the real Maureen ? Sometimes when she was alone , walking along the street , she was taken by surprise seeing her reflection in a store window , a remote , ghostly reflection she never quite expected or recognized ; it did not really seem herself . Later on Loretta teased her about cutting school , and Maureen said with a tired laugh , " Go ask the nuns , then , if you 're so sure ! " And Loretta teased her about using some of her new lipstick , and Maureen said vehemently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I 'd never touch that stupid grape lipstick of yours ! " She felt set upon by her mother and unable to locate any center to her mother 's assaults , any reference point . Furlong often looked on with a faint smile , making no sense of it either  --  not knowing that Loretta was wrong or knowing it and taking no part ? But one day Loretta tossed a small gold tube onto Maureen 's bed . She said , " Here . Here 's your own , no need to sneak mine . "  |p183It  was a tube of lipstick . " Oh , Ma ! " Maureen said . She picked it up cautiously . She opened it : pink . " Go take it , try it on , " Loretta said . Puffed and slowed down , wearing a maternity blouse , she stood in the doorway with her arms crossed , tapping her fingers impatiently on one arm . Maureen went to the mirror . She dabbed on some lipstick , still cautious , and in the mirror she caught sight of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual razzing smile , a kind of good-natured , lopsided smile she had picked up while being a waitress . " Okay . That looks nice , " Loretta said . " I look funny , " Maureen said . " No . You look nice . " " But I ca n't wear it to school . They do n't allow  --  " " Are n't you going to say anything ? " " Thank you . " " Now you can leave my stuff alone , eh ? " " Oh , Ma ! " She turned to catch her mother 's eye . Her mother was staring toward her , not exactly at her ; the thoughtful , to stay at the garage later , sometimes missing supper . Loretta no longer worked and she had n't much to do except sit around . It was winter now . She would sit silently at the table , staring at the oilcloth covering . Maureen would come home from school and find her there . The television set would not be on . Maureen would turn it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supper , fooling around in the kitchen , taking her time . She liked to make supper . It was easy to please people , to please men , just by giving them food . In the old clays she had made her father 's supper too . It was the same supper . The same food . She would chat with her mother , opening and closing cupboard doors , looking in the refrigerator . She would alwaysask her mother how she felt . Loretta would always say , " I 'm all right . " Then , sourly , she might add , " I 'm too old to go through this again . " But Maureen pretended not to understand . There were secrets of female life open to her , ready for her to learn , but shep184rejected them . She did not even look at her mother 's stomach if she could help it ; magically , her eyes glanced away . After supper she cleared the kitchen and did the dishes by herself , since Betty was never around to help and would n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homework until Furlong came home . He came home later and later as the winter went on . No one said anything . From the kitchen Maureen could see her mother padding around the other room going to change the televisionchannel , or going into the bedroom , opening a drawer , closing a drawer , making at times a sound that could have been sobbing . The two of them , alone so much , drifted to opposite ends of the little apartment . Maureen thought of them as two women with nothing to say . She herself was a woman , but in disguise as a child ; if they saw that she had grown up , they might want to talk to her . Maureen pretended to hear nothing , not even her mother 's sobbing . Was that sobbing ? Loretta was too strong to cry , no man could make her cry . It was unthinkable . But still Maureen pretended to hear nothing , pressing her hands over her ears , trying to make sense of her schoolwork . Why should her mother cry ? Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like to have a baby ? Maureen daydreamed about being pregnant herself . She would have a baby someday . Shc would get married and have a baby , dress herself in the puffy big blouses her mother wore , the same kind , a woman like her mother ; she could not escape . She did not want to get married but there was no other way . She did not want to live with a man , sleep with a man . It made her angry to think of a future in which she waited in an apartment for a man to come back from whatever it was men did , all those hours spent with other men somewhere , talking about something , swearing and laughing angrily , letting their half-closed fists fall onto table tops , peeling the labels off bottles of beer , looking at clocks , shifting their shoulders restlessly inside their clothes . When they were together , men talked of things that could not be told to women . One night Furlong did n't come home until late . Maureen waited around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to sit up and wait for him , to get him supper . Her head ached . She sat in the kitchen with a book in front of her , waiting . Loretta and Betty had both gone to bed . Maureen made marks on the oilcloth withp185her fingernail , writing out her name and trying to erase it . She thought of Loretta lying in bed , waiting . The clock said twelvethirty , then one o'clock , and still he was n't home and still she waited . She had to get up for school the next day . " That dirty bastard , " she said to herself , writing " Furlong " in the oilcloth cover . One night Furlong did n't come home until after two . He was drunk . He stumbled against a chair , sending it clattering , waking Maureen from her fitful sleep . She could hear him in the kitchen  --  he was moving something around . She called Loretta and woke her . " He 's home , " she said . " I 'm going to bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm going to bed . " She went into her room in a hurry . She lay down on her bed , wanting to sleep at once , feeling how urgent it was that she sleep . She had to wake up the next day at seven-thirty . . . but her mind was racing in a panic . She thought of Furlong hitting her mother : she thought of that startled furious cry , her mother 's cry . She thought of Jules in jail again . What if he got arrested again ? She thought of her father . He was mixed up with her father , the two of them mixed together , stumbling home late at night . It was no surprise . Two tons of steel had fallen down on him , her father . And if Furlong died ? Any money ? What about the baby Loretta was going to have ? Aid to Dependent Children ? A check a month ? Welfare ? What then ? Jules had quit school and worked . He brought Loretta twenty dollars a week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and then she could make money ; she needed to get out . In the other room they were arguing . She needed to get out , the way Jules had . . . she needed money . . . she had to get out . . . She was mopping the kitchen floor . She had to make sure she did n't step in the wet , because that made the linoleum dirty again . Black and white squares . The mop splashed soap onto the floor . She had to move the table and chairs out of the way , then mop the floor . . . " Maureen ! Maureen ! " It was confused with mopping the floor : she felt the handle ofp186the mop strong in her hands . She ached to clean the floor . She liked the smell of soap , she liked cleanliness that was harsh and bright .. . " Maureen , " Loretta said angrily , " come out here ! You 're only pretending to be asleep ! " She rolled over . In the other bed , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She heard nothing . Maureen heard everything and had to get up . She saw that her mother was very angry , very upset . " I know you 're pretending , you 're fooling around ! " Loretta said . She was about to cry . " Come out here ! He 's in the kitchen sick andI 'm not doing one more thing for him , the hell with him ! I 'm fed up ! " Maureen stumbled into the living-room . She rubbed her eyes . She must have fallen back to sleep . " What do you want ? You want to sleep in my bed ? " " Sleep out here on the couch . Come on . " " What ? " " Stop pretending or I 'll slap your mouth ! " " What 's wrong ? " " He 's out there puking and the hell with him . I 've had enough , " Loretta said . Her eyes were streaked with tiny red veins . " I 'm going to sleep . I 'm sick . " " What 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I got school tomorrow  --  " " Oh , you and your school , you and your library ! Go tell him your troubles , you and him have all the troubles in the house , to hear you talk ! Go make him some coffee . " " What ? " " Make him some coffee . " " You woke me up to make coffee ? " " I said make the bastard coffee . " She slammed the door behind her . Maureen looked through to the kitchen . The clock said two-thirty . She could see Furlong 's legs . He must have been sitting at the table , listening . In the dim light the room looked clean and unfamiliar , like the surface of another planet , or the cold , smooth surface of the moon . The soiled walls did not look soiled . The oilcloth gleamed white.  |p187On  the stove the coffee pot looked as if it might be made of silver . She went to the stove . Furlong said , " What happened to your mother ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Where ? " " In my bed . " " Why 'd she do that ? " Maureen did not look at him . She got a jar of coffee down off a shelf . " She says you 're sick . " " Why 'd she wake you up ? Are you making coffee ? " " She told me to make it . " " Is that why she woke you up ? " " She wanted to sleep in my bed . " She saw him out of the corner of her eye , sitting heavily , too tired to move . Like a dog , he shook himself unconsciously and without meaning . He said , " You mean she kicked you out of your room ? Good Christ ! " But he remained sitting at the table , waiting for his coffee like a man sitting at a diner counter . Maureen got a cup for him . It was easy to please men , to stay out of their way . He was a little drunk , but there was always a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was hard to understand that he was dangerous : he could knock things around , break things . Maureen served him coffee . After a while he said , " Your mother says you been running with some bad kids . That true ? " " You mean Betty . " " No . You . " " Not me . " " Some store manager caught you shoplifting ? " " No . " She turned to look at him , fully . He had fine lines on his forehead and at the corners of his eyes from laughing too much . There was silence in him , but it was not like the silence her father had had ; it came in chunks , thoughtfully . " Your ma did n't make all that up , " he said coaxingly . " I do n't know what she did . " " I just want to know if it 's true or not . "  | " I told you it was n't ! " " Look , I 'm your stepfather now  --  " " You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor . " You calling your own mother a liar ? " " I 'm not calling anybody anything . " " What about me , you calling me a liar ? " Maureen poured the rest of the coffee into the sink . " What are you doing ? " " Cleaning up . " " I was n't finished with that . " " You did n't want any more . " " Yes , I did . I did want more . You did that on purpose . " " I did not . " " You did too . " They were silent . Maureen stood with her back to him , at the sink . She waited . Her face was very hot . Then , abruptly , he leaned forward and knocked the coffee pot out of her hand . It clattered on the floor . Maureen shrieked . " You poured that out on purpose ! " Furlong said . She picked up the coffee pot , not looking at him . He said , " She told me she 'd make some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place up  --  you wo n't recognize this dump when I 'm through ! Put that back on the stove ! " Maureen put it back on the stove . " Put some water in it ! " Maureen was afraid of him , but she was more afraid of her mother : her mother 's silence . Loretta was listening to all this , listeningin silence , and would not get up to help her . " I said put some water in it . What are you standing there like that for  --  are you crazy ? " " You 're the one , " Maureen muttered . " What ? What did you say ? " Maureen did not answer . " Do you want your teeth knocked out ? " Furlong said . " Nobody 's going to knock my teeth out . " " Just now your mother said , five minutes ago she said I 'd betterp189teach you something before it 's too late  --  I do n't want the police sticking their noses in around here . " " What about the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not in any trouble . " " Look  --  " " I 'm not ! I 'm not in any trouble ! " " Well , you better not , " Furlong said . He was breathing hard . " Like that goddam smart-aleck brother of yours , you can get out and on the street . I wo n't stand for it . I do n't want my name smeared up in anything . I 'm not getting mixed up or taken down to no police station , believe me . " " I 'm not in any trouble , " Maureen said feverishly . " Stealing lipstick from a five-and-ten ? " " I did n't steal any lipstick ! " " You calling your mother a liar ? " " Ma is maybe sick . . . " She was silent . She could hear Loretta listening to them . She could picture her mother 's face there in the darkness , in Maureen 's own bed , listening to all this . " Did Ma really tell you that  --  you should teach me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . " He was drinking his coffee . He was still a little drunk and his shoulders were hunched toward the table . " Your mother tells me lots of things about you . " " Why ? " " I do n't know why . " " But why does she hate me ? I do n't hate her  --  why does she hate me ? I ca n't stand it ! I do n't know what to do . She always liked Jules better than me . It did n't matter how good I was . Then Jules left and she still likes him better , everybody does . Now she acts so strange but I did n't do anything , it 's Betty who hangs around places and steals things . Ask Betty yourself . Look in her side of the room , look under her bed ! She takes all kinds of junk  --  she steals stuff she does n't even want ; she says it sticks to her fingers  --  just for fun . I do n't hate Ma  --  why does she hate me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up things ? " " Go to bed . Forget about it . "  |p190He  pushed his chair away from the table , but not to face her . He was facing the wall instead , looking at the wall , his neck and shoulderstense . " I 'm going to run away if she does n't quit . If she hates me I 'm going to run away . I 'll live somewhere else like Jules  --  " " You 're not going anywhere , so shut up . " " I 'll get a job and run away . " " You 're not leaving this place ! You 're not getting into trouble ! Shut up and forget about it ! " Furlong said loudly . " Then ask her why she hates me  --  " He turned suddenly , with an effort , and slapped her . He hit her on the side of the face , a surprise to them both . What she felt about his hand was its sudden cracking pressure ; the blow had not hurt . " Now shut up ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go to bed ! " " You dirty bastard , " Maureen said . He jumped to his feet and slapped her again . The chair was knocked aside . Maureen started for the door but he jerked her back . He shook her so that her head bobbed and she thought her neck would snap . " Get us in trouble and see what I 'll do to you  --  see what happens ! " he yelled , then let her go . Maureen ran into the living-room , too surprised to cry . She could hear her mother listening , she could see those pinpoints of eyes there in the dark . Why did n't Loretta get up ? Why did n't she come out here ? Why that silence from that room ? Maureen opened the door to the stairway and stepped outside . Now that she was safe she began to cry . She sat down with her back to the door . She pressed her fists against her eyes and drew her knees up to her chest , feeling herself safe on the drafty stairway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hours passed . She made her way back into the apartment . The kitchen light was still on . She lay down on the sofa and fell asleep . When she woke up she had a headache . Her mother was leaning over her . She said , " I told you lots of times he 's got a bad temper . I told you not to provoke him . " Maureen lay exhausted on the sofa . She stared blankly at her mother . " You better get up , " Loretta said . " What ? "  | " It 's morning . Time to get up . " " Morning ? " " Stop looking so stupid . You asked for trouble , do n't drag me into it . " " I did n't ask for any trouble  --  " " Reeny , you have that snippy-snotty look  --  you should see yourself in a mirror ! When you look like that there 's always somebody going to slap you . " " I did n't provoke him . I did n't say anything . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he comes in . " " I do n't give a damn about him . " " You 'd better give a damn . " Loretta looked at her critically , yet with a kind of affection . It was a wavering , hesitant look that made Maureen shiver ; she could not understand it . " Maureen , you should even out those bangs of yours . They 're too heavy on one side . You look like a goddam dope that way . " " What ? " Maureen said , surprised . " Your hair . Go get me the scissors and I 'll do it myself . " " What 's wrong with my hair ? " " It needs straightening out . " " I 'll do it after school , " Maureen said . She was very confused . " Get me the scissors . Come on . " She went out into the kitchen and Maureen followed , in a daze . Loretta reached out and made snapping motions with her fingers . Maureen got her the scissors from a drawer . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her swelling stomach , and began to cut her hair . Maureen sat in a daze , obedient . " I 'm sorry about last night , " Loretta said , " but you know what lie 's like . Men are like that . They do n't put up with crap . Now , keep these bangs trimmed , do n't let them get too heavy . Too much hair up here gives you pimples . It 's from the oil in the hair . You should know that at your age . " Loretta leaned around to look at Maureen 's face . " There are some blackheads on your nose , kid . Take care of yourself . You got a nice face so take care of it , right ? " Maureen wanted to hide her face in her mother 's dirty old kimonoand ask Why ? Why ? Why was everything so loud and confuscd ? Why was everything ready to fly into pieces ? She knew she would have to leave home.  |p192Late  that afternoon , when she got home from school , Loretta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The intense red of her lips was matched by two oval spots of rouge on her checks . Furlong was home . Loretta said to her , " Reeny , your stepfather has something to say to you . " Reluctantly Maureen went into the kitchen . Furlong was sitting with an untidy pile of newspapers around him ; every day he bought two newspapers . When she approached he glanced up as if he had n't known she had come home until now . He said , embarrassed , " Guess I had too much to drink last night . " Maureen stared boldly at him . " There 's too much going on all over , " he said , gesturing toward the papers with their headlines and photographs . The face of Eisenhowerlooked up at Maureen . " Well , I 'm sorry , " Furlong said . Maureen said nothing . Loretta came into the kitchen and clapped her hands together lightly . " All friends again ? " she said . " Sure , " said Furlong . " What about you , stuck-up ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not mad any more , huh ? It 's all over ? " " Sure , Ma , " Maureen said . " Sure , " said Furlong . He and Maureen glanced at each other by accident and looked away at once . The shame between them was strong and sharp as the bath powder Loretta always dabbed on herself. 15 It came to her at night , when she thought she was sleeping : she had to get out . She had to get money . In her dreams she caught up with Jules on the street and asked him , IIowdo you get money ? She dreamed about her father . Her dead father was sitting at a kitchen table in a room without walls , reading a newspaper . his eyes were vacant and alarmed at the headlines . Maureen came over to see what he was reading , but there was nothing there  --  theyp193did n't know the secret , she and her father , to what was in the newspaper . But money was behind it all , surely . Money was the secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it was Maureen who had to get him when he stayed too late at the garage . In the past he had drifted home by way of several bars , taking his time , but now Maureen went to get him to see that he got home . His back was not good . It was n't getting well the way it was supposed to . So Loretta sent Maureen out , never Betty . " Look , you 're the favorite , " she would explain . " You 're his favorite . Get him to come home and eat . " Maureen hated going the three blocks down to the garage , hated the risk of going out on Michigan Avenue at twilight , hated approaching the cluster of men inside the gas station , whether Furlong was there or not . Sometimes he was n't there . Standing in the cold halo of light from the garage doorway , she watched the men before they noticed her , wondering what men did talk about when they were alone  --  what secrets they had . She hated their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was Pat Furlong 's stepdaughter . She was Maureen Wendall , standing out in the cold and waiting , come to take her stepfather home . Furlong , reluctant and swaggering , always took time to say goodnight to his friends , ignoring her . Sometimes she waited out by the gas pumps for ten , fifteen minutes , while snowflakes fell slowly about her and traffic out on the wide street dwindled , the car headlights misty and expanded in the moist air . She wondered where those cars were heading . Would one of them stop to give her a ride ? She caressed her arm through t h e thickness of her coat sleeve , puzzled , unable to figure out why she was puzzled , as if the feeble pattern of traffic before her held some knowledge she should have possessed . In the deepest part of her was a question : Why was she herself and not someone else ? But then , as if to muffle this question , she would think , I might as well be here as anywhere else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise , not exactly remembering that she had been waiting for him . " Okay , come on , " he would say , already in a hurry . She had to walk fast to keep up with him . He took impatient , yard-long strides , as if trying to escape her . One evening she said to him , " Why wo n't Ma let me get a job ? "  |p194He  glanced over his shoulder at her . " Wo n't she ? I do n't know . " " Will you ask her if I can get one ? " " Sure . " " Please , will you ask her ? She says she does n't want me to work . She does n't want me out of the house . But I need a job , please , please ask her . " She was conscious of her voice annoying him . It was a mistake to talk too much to men , to this kind of man . They did n't want to hear the voices of women pleading with them . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home to help her , but I could help her at home and have a job too . I could do it all , I could do everything . Will you ask her ? " She was pleading with his back . He wore a short jacket , zipped up to his throat . Maureen leaned forward as she walked , and Furlong , though in a hurry , seemed to be about to turn back to her . " Okay , I 'll ask her . " " If she says no , ask her again . Keep asking her . I need to make money . " But Loretta was against it . Maureen was needed at home . " Anyway , I do n't like her hanging around places . I do n't like her runningaround any more than she does , like going to the library like she says . " The words like she says were ironic ; Maureen caught that but did not understand . What was wrong with the library ? She woke up at night thinking about a job . She thought about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind but only the idea of it , only the word itself . Loretta stood in her way , stubbornly . She needed a job , needed money . But Loretta would only say , her face closed , " I need you around here , I said ! You 'll get in trouble soon enough . " " Ma , I do n't get into trouble ! " " Do n't you talk back to me , Reeny . I told you my opinion . " " But you never believe me . You make up things . I go to the library , that 's the only place I go  --  not even to the movies  --  here , look at the books in my room ! Are n't those library books ? " " Now , do n't start bawling . You always did have a long face , like Grandma Wendall said . You always take things too serious . " Maureen wandered away , clutching at her head . She thought something was going to snap . She needed to be free , out in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them liberated , in thep195open , on their way out of the city and up north . " Why ca n't I get a job ? " she shouted back at Loretta . " A part-time job ? After school ? Why not ? Why do I have to be home all the time ? Why me , why not Betty ? What 's there to do with the baby you ca n't do ? How come Betty can run wild all she wants but I have to stay home ? Why is it ? ' Why is it all so crazy ? " " Do n't you yell at me ! I told you my opinion and that 's that . " The baby 's crying began to get on Furlong 's nerves , or so he said . Ile would n't come home when Maureen went to get him . " The hell with supper , " he would say . So she stopped going to get him and instead waited up for him . Everything had to do with him , with that man , and nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay up late to warm up his supper and make his coffee . He could n't do it himself and Loretta was too tired ; she was always in bed . Sometimes he stayed out overnight , and around two o'clock Maureen would go to bed herself , giving up on him . But then she would have to stay home the next day , cutting school , because Lorettawould feel sick and would n't want to face Furlong alone . So N laureen had to stay home from school and wait out the morning until he came back . She hated him . Her hatred for him was so violent that it was always with her , in the foreground or the background of her mind , everywhere with her . She felt that he was turning into her real father , being always with her in her imagination . On these quiet , dopey mornings she read through books she had already finished , her mind desperate , her body sluggish and sullen . Loretta moved the television set into the bedroom , and since Maureendid not want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch those stupid daytime shows  --  there was just nothing to do , no escape . The old daydreams were all finished . She could not summon up out of her imagination the classroom scenes she had once gloried in , with herself as a teacher . She would never be a teacher . She could not make herself imagine Furlong dying in an ; incident  --  the vision faded , she forgot to keep it going . There was nothing in her but a hatred for him so diffuse that it was like her own blood , coursing mechanically through her . She ransacked her mind but there was nothing in it . Everything was emptied out , exhausted . She might have been inhabiting her mother 's body . Thep196only richness was in books , but the books lay on the sofa , read and reread , emptied . They could no longer stir her . Sometimes she thought idly about earthquakes , fires , buildings cracking in two . She thought about accidents in which automobiles piled on top of each other , one after another . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of money , as she had thought about the idea of a job . But then she began to think about the feel of money ; she took a dollar bill out of her room , out of a hiding place , and stared at it . In this way she could pass an hour or more . She remembered how easily Jules had given her eight dollars ; it had happened so quickly , like magic ! Furlongcarried his wallet in his back pocket . It was tight in that pocket , wrinkled and worn out . In it he had lots of bills . She wondered how much money he had . He got a check twice a month and Loretta got a check once a month . How much money did they have ? She imagined a hiding place for money : the veranda of the old house on Labrosse . She could crawl under the veranda , into that dirty secret place , and hide everything there . No one would find it . She could stay there herself , hiding , and no one would find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with grades of 1 ) . Even in English , her best subject , she got D 's . She sat stunned and ashamed , sliding her test papers into her desk , hiding them quickly . Everything was so precarious . She had always gotten A 's and B 's , but now she had slid down to D and could honestly not understand why . It just happened , by itself . She should have asked her teacher about it but instead she remained in her seat or hurried quickly out of the room when the bell rang , anxious to get away . She walked home daydreaming . She sat in school daydreaming . She was getting slow , silent . There was a slight insolent edge to her stare when she was scolded . What the hell did it matter ? Homework , schoolwork , oral questions , all that junk . . . She imagined finding an old paper bag on the sidewalk  --  with money inside ! No one would bother to pick it up except her . She imagined finding an old paper bag next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a corner of a restroom  --  filled with bills , all kinds of bills !  --  money that was all hers and that no one else knew about . There was something aching behind her eyes that told her shep197had to get this money , had to get out , never mind where , had to escape  --  as if , while she tried to read her homework or a novel from the library , a certain passage struggled to make itself clear to her . It was magic that did not quite work . She might open a book anywhereand let her eye fall upon a paragraph and that would be the paragraph that could tell her what she needed to know  --  but when she read it , she could not understand . Sometimes she could not even understand the words . What was this code ? Did it make sense to other people ? She said to her friend Carol , " Do you ever think about running away ? " " Not any more , " Carol said slowly . " Does n't it bother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrugged her shoulders . " But you do n't want to run away ? " " They just bring you back again . To the same place , " Carol said . Maureen talked to another girl , an older girl , who had run away and was caught in Buffalo . " Where did you get the money for the bus ? " Maureen said . " Stole it , " said the girl . " Why did you run away ? " " I wanted to . You know . " " Are you going to run away again ? " The girl was slightly embarrassed at Maureen 's attention . " Naw , it was too much trouble . They just think you 're going to have a baby and they take a test of you . They got minds that low , " she said with a laugh , measuring a foot or so off the floor . She tried to hunt Jules on the street . He was seventeen now and should know everything . Sometimes she believed she saw him ahead of her , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brother of a friend of his , a kid with greasy hair and tight pants , and asked him about Jules ; he looked evasive . " Tell him I want to sec him . I want to talk to him , " she pleaded . And then , after time passed , something happened to her . A change came over her one morning as she sat staring out the window of the apartment at nothing . The baby was crying . Loretta as bathing him . Maureen felt a certain hardness come over her , as If something invisible were blessing her , as if a shell were shapingp198itself out of her skin . She drew back from the window , thinking it was a draft of cold air . She shivered . Her muscles cringed and then relaxed in acceptance . She felt herself change . The next day she left school early , soon after lunch . She told Sister Mary Paul that she had a bad headache , which was true . Her head always ached . But on the way home she dawdled  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she glanced up at them , mildly surprised , as if she had no idea where she was going or what she could expect . Her expression was pleasant , wondering . When she had walked about a mile , aiming toward downtown Detroit , she saw a car slow in front of her and pull over toward the curb . She walked along the sidewalk without hurrying and without fear . When she was passing the car the driver leaned out and said , " Would you like a ride ? " She thought for a terrifying moment that he was Furlong , in a different car . But then she saw that he was a stranger and that he looked nothing like Furlong . She took in his face at once ; it was all right . It did not matter who he was . " I could use a ride maybe , " she called out . She got in . The man said quickly , " Do you live around here ? " " Oh , I live back there . I was just going for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . " " Arc you in high school ? " " I 'm a senior . " " What 's your name ? " " Maureen . " He smiled nervously , not hearing any of this , and she too smiled  --  but not nervously . She let her long chestnut-colored hair fall for ward . Under her coat she wore her navy-blue jumper , a little short for her now , and loafers like all the girls wore ; she carried her books cradled childishly in her arms . Once in the car she felt relieved , as if she had safely crossed a boundary line . She let her books fall onto the seat between them . She said softly , " On a nice day like this I like to go for a ride , but we do n't have a car . My parents do n't have a car ; I do n't know anyone who has one . " " Nobody at all ? "  | " Oh , maybe somebody . " " No boy friends ? " " I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're in  --  high school ? ' What year are you ? " " My last year , " she said , lying with a dazzling smile , letting herselfrelax . The sunlight was like honey . Somewhere she could smell cologne  --  she imagined it . Notes of music drifted into them from hissing cars . She felt as if she were in a boat , being borne gently along a stream , without effort . He drove toward the river . Maureen thought it was strange , how familiar everything looked . She stared at everything ; she was blank and smiling . The very odor of the air was familiar . They passed warehouses , vacant lots . On the river there were boats  --  great barges , lake barges that moved slowly , without sound . She was free . No one could even see her . Freedom came to her like air from the river , not exactly fresh , but chilly and strong ; she was free and she had escaped . The man was maybe thirty-five . She could n't tell . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shrewdly she recognized it but gave no sign  --  like a man , she was contemptuous of pleading . Ile stopped the car somewhere . He took out his wallet and took snapshots out of it , showing Maureen pictures of his family . She stared past the pictures to the wallet itself , which was cracked and worn , like Furlong 's . One of the snapshots showed a man in a soldier'suniform  --  the man himself ! Maureen smiled at the pictures . She thought , I 'm not afraid at all . I do n't feel anything . After a while , nervously , clumsily , the man kissed her . Though she could feel his mouth against her own , she did not really feel any-thing . She felt the pressure of his mouth . She kept thinking clearly , I do n't feel anything at all . . . Past his head was the sky . It was normal . The man leaned over her , breathing sharply , and in a strange eager haste embraced her and kissed her again . There was pleading in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands up against his shoulders , not to push him away but just to complete the embraceas she supposed she should . Still she felt nothing . She was untouched . In another minute he was kissing her throat ; he clutched at her and pressed his mouth against her , and Maureen felt a little uneasy for the first time  --  but only for an instant . Theyp200were out in the open . The blue sky faced them above the Detroit River . After a while he moved away . He was very nervous . He said , " I better drive you home . " " All right , " said Maureen . " Do you get a ride home from school most days ? A boy friend ? " " I do n't have a boy friend , " Maureen said . " Why not ? " " I do n't have time for boys . " " Will you be out there tomorrow ? I mean , where you were ? Tomorrowaround this time ? " " All right , " said Maureen . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finallyhe said , " If I came by tomorrow again , maybe we could go for a ride . Would that be all right ? " " All right . " " We do n't have to go far . " " All right . " She met him on the street the next afternoon . She was not wearingher school outfit since she had cut school ; instead she wore a skirt and sweater . Her hair was loose in the wind . The man stared at her when she got in the car ; it was a hard , helpless stare . She did not look at him . She smiled toward him . They drove out along West Jefferson ; the day was slightly overcast and seemed to press them together , to urge them together . " Sit closer , " the man said . Maureen moved over closer to him . " Ca n't you sit any closer than that ? " he said . Maureen gathered her skirt up about her knees and moved over again . The man took both her hands in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slight uneasiness , almost a memory of fear , but it passed . At the very center of him was the money he had that he would give to her  --  she thought about that . They drove along . They passed trucks , cars , buses . Maureen looked around as if she 'd never seen all this before , and the man kept glancing from the street to her , to the side of her face . He was jumpy and his driving was a little clumsy . Maureen wondered what would happen if he had an accident . A police cruiser passed then , ,  |p201in  no hurry . Maureen glanced over into the car . Three policemen , smoking cigarettes . They wore sunglasses in spite of the dull air . He took her to an old hotel on West Jefferson . Maureen did not bother looking around . She climbed the stairs ahead of him , feelinghim behind her with that eager intense stare . Still she felt nothing . It was not personal . If her heart was beating fast , it was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not quite feel , as if her body were at a safe distance from herself . She believed that her teachers , the nuns who had cautioned the girls about certain things , would have felt nothing more than she was feeling  --  it was not possible to feel much . Even fear was too much . They were entering a room . The man closed the door behind them and fastened a chain . Maureen looked around and saw a bed , a chair , a bureau , then she gave up looking . " I wish you 'd take this off , " he said , meaning her coat . He was as tall as Furlong , a tall man , but he was very nervous . What she could see of his face was all right . He had fair , ordinary skin . So long as the fear was on his side Maureen did not have to be afraid at all . He helped her off with her coat politely and hung it up . Then he came to her and embraced her . She cried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders , as if to push him away , but she stood facing him and did not push him away . There was no fear in her . She did not feel anything really ; she was at a distance from this . She closed her eyes . He pressed himself against her , all the length of him , an adult man pressing himself against her . As if they were familiar to each other , she began to move her hands behind him , up to the back of his neck . He was kissing her mouth . She felt the short sharp hairs at the back of his neck . So close together , they could not see each other now ; he would never be able to remember her face . In five minutes it was over , and she lay beside the man , not even looking around the room . She had not felt much pain really . She had imagined that she would feel great pain but it was mild , she ould not quite concentrate on it . Everything in the man had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was vague . ' there was so much feeling on his side that she had not needed to feel anything . After another hour they prepared to leave . He tried to smoothp202out her clothes , which were wrinkled . He was like a father . " Oh , it does n't matter , " Maureen said , surprised that he should care  --  what did her clothes matter ? His concern touched her . She began to cry , surprising herself and him . She covered her face , crying ; but it was not serious . She was able to make herself stop . She forced herself to stop . She did n't know why this had happened  --  she had felt no pain and no fear . It was over . Nothing had really happened . He pulled her onto his knees tenderly . He seemed like someone 's father . " I need money , " Maureen said . " I need to buy things of my own , clothes and things . " He hugged her . He told her to stop crying . He wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finger to his mouth . " I need money , money , " she said . She understood that he would give her money . He was anxious to give her money . But it would take a certain passage of time , a few minutes , several minutes .. . but he would give her money . That fact kept her from breaking into pieces . " She had a baby . . . the bottom part of the spine was n't right , what-ya-call-it . . . it kept dripping out , some water . . . the baby only lived a few weeks ... " " That 's really lousy . . . " Maureen sat on the edge of her bed , leafing through a book . From time to time she glanced up at the door to her room , which could not be shut tightly enough to keep out the voices from the kitchen . Loretta had a visitor , a woman named Rita . Maureen hated to hear their voices , hated to hear the things they said , yet at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand ing everything . They talked in bright patches of sound , rhythmic , robust , in total sympathy , very much together : Maureen did not know if she hated them or envied them . All her life she had heard women talking , together , almost out of earshot but never out of earshot . But the talk did not make sense : she sat on the edge of herp203bed , alone , leafing nervously through a library book , understanding nothing . This woman Rita had bounced up the stairs that morning out of nowhere , " just back from Florida and for good , " wearing a black sweater with spangl on it and black slacks . Her hair was too black to be real . Her e . ere pierced and she wore gold knobs in them . Loretta , open o the door to her , had cried out in surprise and delight , and the two of them had embraced , very excited , affectionate . Maureen had ducked back to her room to get out of the heady air of their excitement and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not understand affection . The book on her lap was Poets of the New World , just the right size and with the right title to keep out snooping people . On page zoo were a number of bills . One of them was a fifty-dollar bill . On page 300 there were more bills . Maureen sat leafing dreamily through the book , not watching the page numbers to see if she was coming to her hidden money but letting herself come upon it by surprise . She felt a mild shock every time she came upon it . That was the strange thing about money ; it was always a surprise . She sat for a while in her room , waiting . Betty 's side of the room was a mess ; they had divided the room in two , and Betty 's junk lay right against the boundary line , where Maureen had pushed it back with her foot . Betty 's clothes lay everywhere in a jumble , clean and dirty clothes , and the junk she collected  --  comic books , even small traffic signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried presence was almost audible in the room , while Maureen 's was not ; this neatness on Maureen 's side of the room , the made-up bed and the mall row of books along the floor , suggested that no one lived here permanently . And this was almost true : on nights when Loretta fought with her husband she kicked Maureen out of bed and Maureenhad to sleep on the sofa . This bed had become Loretta 's bed as much as it was Maureen 's . Maureen did not really own it . Like everything else of hers , it was precarious , and anyway it seemed to her right that she should now be sleeping or lying awake on top of so many strange beds since she had never really had one of her own . At exactly five o'clock she put Poets of the New World back in its place on the floor and picked up three other books . In thep204kitchen her mother and her mother 's loud friend were still talking . They were drinking beer . " This is my Reeny , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching out for Maureen 's hand . " Is n't she grown up real pretty ? " " Sure I remember her . She 's real cute . She was real cute then , a little kid . " Rita smiled with affection at Maureen . " How old arc you , honey ? " " Sixteen . " " Sixteen , Christ ! " The woman screwed up her mouth in a pleasant , bewildered look . " You know , your ma and I were real good friends when you were n't even born yet . In fact your mother was about your age . What do you think about that ? " " Is n't that something ? " Loretta said enthusiastically . Maureen looked toward the floor . Her mother was still holding her hand , expecting something from her . She was trapped by their clumsy good will . What was it about affection she now hated ? Was it having to get close to someone , having to look clearly in someone'sface ? She did not want to look into anyone 's face . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , your mother was only your age . Believe it or not . " " I had long hair then , real long . Down my back , " Loretta said . Maureen smiled and eased away from her . She waited for Loretta'spermission for her to escape ; she was obedient and polite in her school jumper and her clean white blouse . She seemed not to want to look up at her mother and this friend . She did not want to imagine , either , her mother at sixteen years of age , with long blond hair . " Well , kid , where are you off to now ? I suppose you 're going to the library again ? " Maureen wondered at her mother 's meaning . " Yes , Ma , I have three books to return . " " Oh , you  --  you and that library ! " " She 's a real pretty girl , " Rita said warmly . " I like the way kids these days wear their hair . Only what 's that outfit ? " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You 're sending your kids to a nuns ' school after what we went though ? Those stupid bitches  --  ? " " Oh , it 's good for the kids , it does them good . "  |p205Maureen  said good-by and got out . It was spring now and she wore no coat . She walked over to the library , almost happy to be out of one place and not yet in another , suspended and free for a few minutes . When she entered the libraryshe felt a shiver of anticipation pass over her . She went to the librarian 's counter to return the books . Then she went into the reading-room where a few people sat at tables , reading , daydreaming . Someone caught her eye . He held up a copy of Newsweekbefore him and on the cover of the magazine was a woman 's face  --  Maureen did not recognize the face but it was a beautiful one . She returned his look and turned again and left the library . Outside , on the sidewalk , she waited until he caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any trouble ? " he said . " No . About the same . " She walked alongside him , swinging her purse gently , smiling , and he crowded a little against her . She had met him about three weeks before , seeking him out because he had a certain safe , restless look . She could draw near to a man and through half-closed eyes assess him , never really looking at him ; it was a feeling in her blood . She lowered her head in a certain way , she let one foot slide out so that the ankle touched the floor , she pretended to be thinkingseriously about something in her own life , and in this way she felt his attention move upon her like a strong light , bathing her in it and marking her . " It 's a nice day today . It 's a good day . " He leaned against her slightly as they walked , touching her arm . She felt his body leaning . toward her . He was not a shy man or a very gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was greedy for the money lie would give her today , stuck away now in his wallet . It was supposedto be out of sight and out of her concern for the moment . But she thought keenly about it , its passing from his hands into hers , its becoming her money . The bills would not change in any way and yet they would become hers . Its power would become hers . The man 's giving her his money was not a simple act but a transformationof the money itself , so that it became another kind of money , it became hers , it was magical in her hands and secret from the world , and yet it was unchanged.  |p206He  was saying , nudging her , " What are you thinking about ? You look so strange . What are you always thinking about ? " " Nothing . " " Nothing ? Not about me ? " " No . " " Sure , you 're thinking about me ! " He was joking , and she glanced up at him , smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen enough of him that first day to know that he had a rather hard , demanding face , that his hair was trimmed short , that his fingernails did n't seem dirty , that the clothes he wore were fairly good  --  at least she thought they were fairly good . She had known that when they were alone he would grab her , and that when they tried to talk to each other their words would come out nervous and warm , like slaps . It was like talking to Loretta sometimes : not really talking . About his private life she never thought and had no curiosity . She did not wonder if he was married or not or if he had a good job or not . He might have had no job at all . She really did not think of him except as a man she met a few times a week who gave her money and who was carrying now the money he would give her later that afternoon  --  that was the secret and central part of his being , which would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go somewhere ? " he said . " Anywhere , " Maureen said . " My car 's parked here . You want to go for a ride , kid ? " " All right . " He rubbed his hand across the back of her neck , now that they were in the parking lot and off the street . He opened the car door for her . She got in , passing near him , and he bent down to kiss hcr . At this point it began : a kind of beginning . He changed , she could feel him changing . He said against her mouth , " I 've been thinking of you all this time . . . " And it was not any particular truth he was saying  --  in fact she supposed he was lying  --  but it was the truth of his needing to say it that made her know that everything was all right . He embraced her . Everything was all right with him . Sitting in the car , she let the strength flow out of her body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaping , disappearing into the air ,  |p207and  clumsily the man leaned over her , trying to define some need of his with his own body , his hands . There was something gay and extravagant in his passion  --  sparks that seemed to flirt with her , leaping about her , sparks of excitement she could not quite grasp and had a little curiosity about sometimes but could not get hold of herself . Shaken , he drove out Woodward Avenue , driving fast as if to exhibit his power . She let her eyes trail along the string of familiar buildings . On the radio a popular song was playing . The air was good , as this man had said , touched with spring . Maureen wondered why it did n't mean more to her . She could n't quite remember the spring before , the year before . She thought she 'd always liked spring , relieved at having lived through another winter , but now this feeling belonged to her friend , who was steering the car with one hand and squeezing her hand with the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was giddy with it , while Maureen sat calmly and looked out at the stores and the people , all those people with money in their pockets going in stores to buy things , to lay out money on counters , to give money to other people , a cycle that never stopped . He was talking to her and she had to listen . " Are you still a homeroom secretary ? " he said . " Tell me about that . " " There 's nothing to tell . " " I remember being in school  --  my homeroom  --  we had a presidentand a secretary too . Tell me about it . " " Really , there 's nothing to tell . " After a while he said , " Tell me more about your mother . Do the two of you fight all the time ? She does n't really believe it , does slic ?  --  that you 're running around ? What about your father , what does he think ? " " I do n't know . I do n't know anything about them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once and she found out ? Tell inc about it . " Ile drove out past Palmer Park , where small crowds of people drifted in the spring sunshine , looking dazzled by it . An unruly mob of ducks and geese were scrambling for food around the pond , fighting with one another . Out in the water benches had been thrown , one of them on end , and a pigeon was perched on it , watch/ing the spectacle . The sunlight glinted beautifully on everything . There should have been music . People were on the tennis courts , playing tennis or hanging around . Maureen put her hand over the man 's hand and stroked his fingers . This might keep him silent . She wondered what it was like to be a tennis player ; not to play tennis , she had no interest in that , but to be a tennis player , one of those girls in a white outfit with a sweater slung over her back and its sleeves tied in front of her .. . He drove past the State Fair Ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a few of them , women , stood out in the sunlight . The man took her to a motel outside Detroit , a place painted white , with pink neon lights . There were several cars in the parking lot with out-of-state license plates . Maureen got out of the car and waited for him to come back from registering , then went with him to the room . The Venetian blinds were already drawn . The man helped her take off her jumper and , with a gentle , kindly pretense of authority , drew the skin taut at the tips of her eyes . " You should get more sleep . Is your family still so crazy ? " lie said . Maureen said nothing . Standing in her white slip , she drew the covers back from the pillows , thinking that this scene , the pillows and the sallow light , were so familiar that she no longer had to place herself among them . She was here and yet not here . But an accident disturbed her  --  she happened to catch sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't meant to see it . He was unbuttoning his shirt , looking down , and she noticed that he wore a platinum stretch-band watch and that there were tiny buttons on the points of his collar , holding them down neatly ; his face looked a little coarse with hurrying . He came to her and they passed into another part of the cycle , now that they had stopped talking , and Maureen felt the flesh of his back dutifully as if only now was she beginning to recognize him . But this too was familiar . She had memorized all the parts of the cycle , the route the machinery took to its inevitable end ; she wanted to hurry it along . His skin was a man 's skin , a little rough . It felt almost sandy beneath her fingers . He himself was a little rough , and so she seemed to be guiding him with her hands on hisp209back and her mouth near his . A man was like a machine : one of those machines at the laundromat where she dragged the laundry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cycle had begun when he had opened the door of his car for her , and in a minute or two it would end with his sudden paralyzed tension , his broken breath against her face , the familiar urgent signs of a man 's love . For he spoke of love , groaning against her , " Jesus Christ , but I love you . . . I 'm crazy about you ... " Afterward they lay together under the cheap cotton cover and he talked in another voice . He was cheerful and energetic , a little loud . " Your mother does n't really believe it , the crap she says , does she ? Why would she let you go out then ? " He was setting a certain argument before her , certain blocks of logic . It did not matter what they meant . " I do n't know , " Maureen said . " You should get more sleep . Get to bed early . " " All right . " " Do you need much money ? " " Yes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What kind of things ? Skirts and dresses ? " " I do n't know . " " You want to buy pretty things for yourself , huh ? " Maureen closed her eyes . " I could buy them for you . Let me buy you something . " " No , " she said simply , " I would rather have the money . " " But I could buy you something nice myself . You could pick itout . " " I would rather have the money . " " If I did n't give you money , you would n't come with me ? " Maureen did n't answer . She felt too weary to answer . " Then you do n't like me , huh ? " " I like you . " He laughed . He was in a very good mood . " Do you love me ? " he said . " Yes , I love you . " She spoke in a dull , vacuous manner , perfectlyobedient.  |p210She  could hear traffic getting louder outside on Woodward ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , heading north . She felt a shiver pass over her , thinking of men in cars headingout of the city , north to the suburbs where they lived , a steady , noisy stream of cars . So many people , so much urgency . It was strange that she had to lie still on this strange bed , in a room this man had rented , while everyone else was escaping , driving away from the city . She eased away from him a little . Her heart had begun to beat quickly . When she got home , around seven , she went right to the bathroomand got her mother 's jar of cold cream out of the medicine cabinet . Loretta followed Maureen into the bathroom . " Help yourself , do n't bother asking . Feel free , " she said . Rita was gone now but her chattiness was in the air and had infected Loretta . " Well , can I have it ? " Maureen said patiently . " Why not ? We got to live together . " She slid past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat on the edge of her bed . Loretta followed . Maureen could see Poets of the New World from where she sat . She had more money to be put in the book  --  that night she could count it all up . She could lock herself in the bathroom and count it . She put cold cream on her face while her mother slouched in the doorway , smoking . Maureen did not listen to her mother 's chatter but thought about her own face . Maybe it was getting older , changed , by the friction of those rough faces against hers . Somethingwould change in her face . She wondered if all women who gave themselves to men felt the imprint of faces on theirs  --  how did you get them rubbed off ? They were like shells enclosing her face , hard and ugly . Her own skin would get rough . Loretta was saying a little drunkenly , " That Rita is a real sweet kid , she 's my heart , that one . Two times she helped me out , two times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cold cream off her face with a tissue . On the tissue there were no particular signs  --  just cold cream , a little dirt . Specks of dirt . No sign . She did not dare to be relieved , however . It was bad luck to be relieved when danger was past ; danger was never really past . What about the money in her purse ? What if Loretta snatched up her purse , in fun , and looked inside ? She wasp211nosy enough to do this . A shudder began low in Maureen 's spine . She wiped her face and crumpled up the tissue , wondering if her mother could guess . Yes , her mother would guess if she opened the purse . No , she would n't guess anything . Did she know already ? Or was it all a joke ? Maureen 's spine felt cold and brittle as if it were turning to ice . It felt as if it might break suddenly . And then all the spinal fluid would gush out . She thought of that man hanging over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed into her and released as if it had been just too much for him and he had to get rid of it , the sooner the better . She thought of her mother and Furlong . She thought of her mother and her father , her dead father . Very slowly she wiped cold cream off her throat , thinking of these things . It was good to feel clean , yet there was a greasy , clammy feel to her skin from the cream . It was not really clean . Her back was very cold , brittle . If a man fell upon her now he would break her in two , her spine would snap . She could not understand these things . She could not understand the weight , the force that drew men and women together , of their own free will . What she could understandwas the money in her purse , and the money in that book . It was something that could be counted again and again ; it was as real as a novel by Jane Austen . Loretta , lounging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign of going away . " So how was the library , kid ? Learn a lot ? " " Ma , you should turn off that stupid television and read somethingyourself . There 're all kinds of books in the library , " Maureen said suddenly . " You 'd learn something . " " Oh , the hell I would ! What ? " " There 're books on all kinds of things . " " Like what ? " " I took out a book of poems , it 's right there on the floor . Poems . " Loretta looked down at the row of books . " Poems , hell . Shit , " she said , and left the doorway . Is she real ? Maureen wondered suddenly . Is any of this real ? She remembered hearing her mother talk once about being a mother , about having children . Loretta had said that it was strange to be a mother because if the kids were n't in the room with you  --  were they really around ? Did you really have them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the important one , was some/one you never got around to having  --  what then ? Loretta had spoken slowly and seriously . She 'd been talking to Connie , across Grandma Wendall 's body . And Maureen , half listening , had been struck by something pathetic and frightening in her mother 's voice . If the kids were n't in the room with you , did you really have them ? And she herself , Loretta 's daughter , could not have said what the answer was . Maybe the book with her money in it , and the money so greedily saved , and the idea of the money , maybe these things were n't real either . What would happen if everything broke into pieces ? It was queer how you felt , instinctively , that a certain space of time was real and not a dream , and you gave your life to it , all your energy and faith , believing it to be real . But how could you tell what would last and what would n't ? How could you get hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended . Money could be stolen , found out and taken , Furlong himself might find it , or it might disappear by itself , like that secretary 's notebook . Such things happened . Objects disappeared , slipped through cracks , devoured , kicked aside , knocked under the bed or into the trash , lost . Nothing lasted for long . Maureen thought of earthquakesopening the earth in violent rifts , swallowing city blocks , churches , railroad tracks . She thought of fires , of bulldozers levelingtrees and buildings . Why not ? While she had lain with that man , only a short time before , it had come to her helplessly that she was there , not out on the avenue , she was in bed with a man and not in a car traveling somewhere . It was her fate to be Man reen ; that was that . But the Maureen she was in the presence of that man she 'd been with  --  he said he was crazy about her and 1w needed her violently  --  did not last . It came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cycle of loving her , still he was sober and eager to switch himself off and drive her home and get rid of her . That was a fact . He was very real to her for about five minutes , that was all . Her clearest memory of the men she 'd been with was their moving away from her . They were all body then , completed . That night Furlong came home early , around ten . Maureen heard him . Then she heard Loretta calling her  --  " Hey , kid , conic out here . Got a job for you . " Maureen got up at once and went out , not even making a face to herself . She was in her bathrobe.  |p213Furlong  was standing by the kitchen table with one hand on the small of his back  --  a gesture of defeat that looked strangely tender . Maureen had never thought much about men feeling pain but she could see that this man felt pain . " Honey , can you rub his back for him ? " Loretta said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . I been feeling dizzy all day . " Maureen looked levelly at her mother and nodded . " I 'll get the stuff for you , " Loretta said . " It 's a real nice favor , Reeny . He wo n't be able to sleep otherwise . " Furlong sat . Maureen waited . The two of them did not speak or look at each other . Loretta came back from the bathroom with the rubbing alcohol and unbuttoned Furlong 's shirt for him , breezy and bullying . " Reeny might as well make herself useful , " she said . " The baby was sick twice today , the poor kid . It 's about all I can take . Now , Reeny , come here . Here 's how you do it . Watch me . " Her mother showed Maureen how to massage Furlong 's back . " Use your fingers hard , you have to do it hard . Around in a circle , " she said . She gave off an odor of something cheap and powdery and pleasant . Furlong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy and fixed , so the odor of his being , the mysterious odor of his soul , was heavy , dark , opaque . There was nothing light about it , nothing powdery . Maureen felt a little dizzy , as if her mother 's dizziness had becomeher own . It was strange : she did not mind her mother 's hands over hers , guiding her own narrow hands on Furlong 's back , the fingertips moving slowly and with a kind of wonder over those strange little bones that make up the spine . Though she was very tired she did not mind any of this , not even her mother 's leaning against her . " Like this , like this , " Loretta said , pleased . To Furlong she said , " I low does it feel ? " Ile nodded gratefully . His face was sweaty with pain . Maureen stared at his thick , smooth flesh beneath her fingers and understoodwhy he was silent . Her father too had been silent . There was too much flesh to men , too much weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know how to do it ? I 'm going to bed , " Lorettasaid and left . Maureen heard her in the bedroom , talking to the baby . Thep214baby whimpered . These sounds , coming from another room , were like a wall : Loretta was on the other side of it . Maureen watched the back of Furlong 's head . She stared down at his neck , which was very still , and his solid back , the pale flesh marred with tiny blemishesand moles that were like secrets of his weakness , something you would never know unless you stood this close . She felt an overwhelming , sharp sense of dizziness . Massaging him became hypnotic . Yet her weariness slowed her hands ; the muscles high on her forearms ached . She paused . She leaned down toward him , as if to whisper in his ear , but instead she laid her cheek against the warmth of his back , near his shoulder . She remained that way for a moment . Then she said , backing off , " Good night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next week , at about five o'clock one afternoon , Mau-/ reen happened to glance out of her friend 's car window as they waited for a light to change on Livernois . On the sidewalk , standing with a group of men who looked as if they 'd been standing there all day , was her mother 's husband , and he was staring at her . Maureen shielded her face with her hand and turned away . " What 's wrong ? " said the man . " Nothing . Never mind . " He drove on . He was in a different mood today , quieter . She did not bother with his moods and kept herself still , waiting for everything to be got over with , for the routine to run itself through , exhaust itself . But suddenly she was very afraid . She began to , tremble . That curious sensation in her spine began again , as if it were the start of paralysis ; the coldness spread through her body . She wondered what was going to happen . He had seen her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had happened in an instant and was over with and yet none of it was over with . She gripped her head with her hands , feeling the actual skull , wonder ing if she was going to faint in this stranger 's car . He was talking about something . She sat very still and stared out at the running landscape of sidewalks and stores . Everything wasp215too bright . Her eyes hurt . She did not think about the man beside her , or about Furlong , or about what would happen when she got home . Instead she fixed her mind upon that book , and the money in it , saved up week after week . It could n't be taken from her , not so easily . It was not possible that she might lose it . She began to breathe quickly , thinking of her money . It was her money . A stream of air from the car window stirred her hair and made her eyes ache . Why was it so cold ? She could not quite remember where they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon or were they on their way ? She 'd been with this man two clays before , or three days . She could not remember . Cautiously she shifted her body and tried to think , testing herself  --  was she sore from him or had n't anything happened yet ? One way or another , she really did not care . Everything was so empty in her that she felt nothing ; her body forgot faster than she herself did . His car smelled of leather and metal . It smelled of some cologne she 'd dabbed on herself , her mother 's stuff in a pale blue bottle . Her hands lay limp on her knees , a schoolgirl 's hands with long fingers and knobby knuckles and a few ink stains . Her hands were very cold . She tested her feet and discovered that they too were very cold . But it was not winter any longer  --  no lopsided dirty mounds of snow remained  --  it was well into spring , people walked ( nit on the street in their shirt sleeves , without coats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stared out . She could not think which street this was . Gates were lifting slowly in front of them  --  they had been waiting for a train to pass . Maureen stared at the lifting gates and felt terror . " Hey , what 's wrong ? You sick or something ? " " No . " He took hold of her hand , concerned . He switched off the car radio , which Maureen had n't heard until he switched it off . She began shaking her head , no , it was always no regardless of what he asked her , she lied automatically and without spirit . Then , reversingherself and lying again , she said , " I have a little headache . It 's nothing . " He squeezed her hand . He pressed it against her thigh . She looked down at his big hand , at the hairs on it , and wondered wily women gave themselves to men when it only came to this : a hand or another part of the body . At her high school girls ran around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything and they got no money in return . She could not understand them ; their excited talk in the washroom was as incomprehensible to her as another language . The girls were alwayssaying , " Oh , I love him so , I 'm crazy about him "  --  and Maureen , curious , vaguely repulsed , could hear through their words a ragged tenderness that was mysterious . They were like creatures of another element , these girls , wild and pretty , with their hair teased high on their heads and their lips bright red , their stockings , their shoes , their clothes bought tight to show the trim bulk of their bodies . They wore identification bracelets that left dull green marks on their wrists . They wore boys ' rings on chains around their necks , chains that left faint green marks . Sisterly in their passion , their need to fall into the maniacal grasp of some boy and give up everything to him , they gathered in nervous , delighted groups and talked . Sometimes they talked in whispers , as if in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain their excited breathing . Their hands flurried in identical gestures , showing helplessness , a stricken delight , a crazy , extravagant falling . It was incomprehensible . Maureen stared at this man 's hand , his fingers entwined with hers . She did not understand why human beings willingly entwined their bodies together , what need had to be so greedily and violently satisfied , why there was such a rush at the last moment to come together , to get it done . . . His skin was coarse . Yet there was something tender and vulnerable about it . Beneath the surface of the skin were three large blue veins , looking swollen , and four bones that led out from his knuckles , raising the surface of his skin . Maureen stared down at his hand . She felt that she was going insane . .. . He was a man , a stranger , looking up at her over a copy of a magazine . His eyes continued on her the way they had run along the line of print , pointing her out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a car passed her . The car slowed . She did not slow her walk or quicken it but continual along the sidewalk . A prickly feeling began on the side of her face . What danger ? Her mother and another woman chattering : about the Negro man who sold Bibles and got into women 's homes and slashed atp217their breasts with a knife . He wore a trench coat and dark glasses and was well groomed . He attacked both white and Negro women . Ile himself had light skin . He was attractive . He wore a trench coat . He was on foot . He could turn up at anyone 's door , selling Bibles . Behind his dark glasses there were probably ordinary eyes , though no one had seen them . He carried a paring knife . They were driving near the expressway construction . The expresswaywas cutting its way north through the city . Everywhere there were mud and giant orange girders . Some were erected over the expressway , some lay in the mud . Men worked in the mud . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man who looked like Furlong , standing by the side of the street , staring out , smoking . She was scrubbing at the kitchen floor , the linoleum . You could never get those black and white squares clean . The soap had a harsh , pleasant smell . The floor dried unevenly ; some parts shone , others dried and looked dirty right away . The white blocks of linoleumwere yellowish . A friend of Loretta 's , talking in the kitchen with her : " His father is dying of cancer , so I said we 'd like the car when he dies , and the old bitch got mad . Who else deserves the car more than us , with Bob working all the way out to Ford 's ? " Some hillbillies were standing on the sidewalk waiting to cross the street . Maureen could tell them by their pale , strained , sleepy , suspicious faces ; they were lean and yet clumsy . A man of about thirty stared toward her . His face was pale , as if finely powdered , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone 's brother ... . The motel was made of concrete blocks painted beige . A neon sign with large looping letters stuck out toward the street . Because of an overpass nearby the motel looked sunken , and a large puddle had formed in front of its driveway . Two cars were parked at one end of the court , license plates from New York and Ontario , Canada . There were beige drapes of a synthetic material , fireproof , in the room . Maureen drew them . The bedspread was tan with strips of red and black . It looked familiar . The man was unbuttoning his shirt , looking down . Maureen shook her head to get her vision clear : she was thinking about the girls at school , huddled in thep218restroom , smoking forbidden cigarettes and talking with joy of forbiddenthings . . . she was thinking about the Negro Bible salesmanwho carried a paring knife . The man came to her and embraced her . She put her arms around him . She was deathly afraid but could not remember why . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half constructed ; the expressway itself ended , suddenly . Great chunks of the city had been taken out , houses and earth . Trees lay toppled over where they had fallen , still . Their roots were a cluster of thin threads and clods of mud . Maureen realized slowly where she had gotten the idea of an earthquake from . Beyond the houses that still remained standing , beyond the trees that had not yet been plowed over , the sky had turned a late afternoon pink , stained by smoke from downriver . Maureen 's eyes took this all in and tried to appreciate it ; it was precarious enough , any kind of beauty . The man said , " I wish they 'd get this damn expressway fin-ished ! " " Sometimes we could keep on going maybe , " Maureen said . Her voice was weak and shrill . " For a ride , a long ride . " He glanced at her . " Sure . A good idea . " " I 'd like to go for a long ride sometime , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there  --  I 've never been to Canada . " " Sure , we 'll do that sometime . " He let her out a block from home and she hurried home . she was carrying her schoolbooks . Her body had become numb . Halfwaythere she saw a girl in jeans jump out of a doorway ; it was her sister . " Hey , Reeny , " Betty said , " what the hell gives ? The old guy is mad as hell . He 's waiting for you up there . You 'd better not go up . Maureen stared at her . She hugged her schoolbooks against her chest . " What 's it all about ? " Betty asked , frank and curious . " Ma says to tell you to come where she is , at Ginny 's . I 'm going to spend the night there too . You better not go home first , he 's mad as hell . He 's drunk . " Maureen went on by . " Reeny , why is he mad at you ? Is he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our room , the bastard , and he found some money in a book of yours . Where 'd you get all that money , ! teeny ? " " Never mind . " Maureen was hurrying toward the corner where they lived . She wondered if Furlong was looking out the window , waiting for her . " Did you steal it , Recny ? Where 'd you get it all from ? Them big bills ? " " Never mind . Shut up . " Maureen got away from her and went up the stairs to the apartment . She walked slowly . She heard nothing . Betty shouted up at her , " You 're crazy ! Come back down ! He 's madder than hell  --  you want your teeth kicked out ? Says he 's gon na turn you over to the cops , on account of that money ... " As Maureen pushed the door to the apartment it swung open . He was coming toward her . She could see a mess behind him  --  the sofa wrenched sideways away from the wall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . He was wearing the same jacket he 'd worn a few hours before , out on the street . It was still zipped up tight . He came toward her and seized her by the neck and dragged her into the room . He was shouting something she could n't catch . She heard the words but they were so close to her , battering her , that she could not make them out . With his free hand he began striking her . He held her up so that she could n't fall and struck her , again and again , while she tried to get away , to fall backwards , away from his hand . She screamed . He began to strike her body . He let go of her and she fell . She put her arms up over her head and screamed against the floor , the linoleum floor , while he bent over to pound her flat on the back with his fists.  |p224being  a good man ? Why not dance around the table the way he did with other people , showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously ? People said to him , " Jules , you 're crazy ! " as they rocked with laughter , or they said , " Jules , you ought to be on television ! " But now he could not imagine why anyone thought him amusing . He sat in his mother 's latest little apartment , on edge with the prospect of seeing what was in the next room , clothed in being a son , a brother , someone dragged to the bottom of the river by chains of blood and love ... . " You think it is n't too bad then ? " Jules said , stirring . " I was talking to Betty the other day  --  " " The hell with her . What she knows goes on the head of a pin . I 'm about ready to wash my hands of that little brat , let me tell you . " " Ma , you feel all right yourself , do n't you ? " " Why do you ask ? " Since Maureen 's beating back in April , and Furlong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Loretta had changed : she had $ haggard look all the time . Sometimes , Jules thought , she looked almost intelligent , as if this suffering had taught her something . I la leaned forward against the table and rested his chin in his hands . Energetic elsewhere , almost feverish with energy , he felt tired and old in his mother 's presence . He felt that he was gradually aging while she remained the same age ; he wanted this to come about , simply so that he could guide her life . They 'd been togetherlong , Jules and his mother , he 'd known her consciously before she had even noticed him , he was shrewder than she , he could s. around corners and Loretta of course could barely see in front her . This morning her face had a subdued , cautious look to it , an her thin eyebrows , above her sharp eyes , gave her a delicate look Jules could see a ghostly image of Maureen 's face in her . Maureen was going to grow up into this face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " She 's probably asleep . " " Last time I came she was asleep . Does she sleep all the time " No , not all the time , " Loretta said impatiently . She picked hbaby up from a kind of crib in which it had been lying . Its face atarms were reddened , as if with a rash . Jules looked at his Iiap225brother without much interest , wondering why he had no interest . " She watches television . I talk to her , we get along , it 's just when that brat Betty makes trouble that things get bad . Look , Jules , I had a talk about Reeny with a doctor down at the clinic , and he says she 'll snap out of it . " " When was that ? " " The end of April . " " Well , it 's June now  --  is she any better ? " " She 's lots better . " " Why wo n't she come out of that room ? " " She 's resting . She 's getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so she 's all right . She 's got a real good appetite , Jules , and a nurse told me that was a good sign . " " Which nurse where ? " Jules said impatiently . " Oh , a real nice woman I met on the bus , a registered nurse . We got to talking , and I told her a little about Maureen  --  " " Jesus , a nurse on the bus ! " " What 's wrong with a nurse on the bus ? What do you want ? You want me to get your sister dumped in some nut-house somewhere , you want me to forget her ? What the hell do you know about it ? My father was n't crazy until they got hold of him , then after that he went to pieces , he was always sitting around in dirty underwear and he stank and they were all like that , up there . Besides , do you know that women get pregnant in those places  --  yes , they do  --  there are only a few nurses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at night all kinds of crazy things happen . It 's a dump , that place , all those places ! " Loretta said , drawing anger out of herself as if to justify everything to Jules . " All kinds of things go on ! Dirty things ! Things you would n't believe ! All he did was beat her up , kid , but in that dump she 'd get a lot worse and she 'd never get back to normal again . I know . The things a woman has to take from men can drive her crazy , and Maureen needs to stay away from them until she can figure them out . " But Betty told me  --  " " The hell with her ! She 's like you , running around ! She spends half her time with so-called friends and one of them is a nigger girl seventeen years old ! "  | " Ma , do n't interrupt me , please , " Jules said . He tried to smile . There was always some weakness in his mother for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Betty said was that there was a lot of money in her room , Maureen 's money . That 's what she said , she told me . " " That was n't Maureen 's money , it was his money . " " Betty said it was Maureen 's . She kept it in a book . " " No , it was his money he was hiding from me . He hid it , the bastard , and got drunk and tried to say that Maureen had stole it from somewhere  --  he said that both of them , Maureen and Betty , had stole it  --  that 's exactly what he said  --  " " Betty 's story is different . " " She 's lying ! She 's a goddam brat on her way to jail , and when they come around with her I 'm going to tell them to lock her up and throw away the key ! Her and her goddam nigger friend and her ugly face ! No , he tried to say it was Maureen 's money that she stole , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place and was hiding from me . " " Then it is n't true what Betty says that . . . that Maureen was out on the street ? " " Jesus ! Of course that is n't true , " Loretta said . Jules looked over toward the closed door that led to Maureen 's room . Ile could hear his mother breathing quickly . He said after a moment , " Well , I did n't believe it exactly but ... " " But what ? " " But Betty said , and also another kid . . . . " " They 're crazy ! And anyway Betty has always been jealous of Maureen , you know that . " " If she had money , why would she hide it ? Why hide it all ? " " Sure , why hide it ? " Loretta said quickly . " Kids do n't lido money . It is n't natural . I know Betty is getting money from soma where but she wo n't let on . I 'm through with her . She spends it right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that nigger bitch are going to buy a motor scooter  --  how the hell do you like that ? It 's going to look nice , my daughter riding around with a nigger on a scooter ! But kids all spend money right away , Reeny would n't 14 any different . No , it was his money all along and he got drunk and tried to blame it on Maureen because they never did get along . Ilep227was jealous of her and you too , because of me . . . he knew I loved my kids more than I did him and that used to drive him wild . No , she was n't doing that . Christ , if I thought  --  " " Okay , Ma . " " A prostitute  --  " " Okay . " " Do n't listen to what they say back in the old neighborhood . They shoot their mouths off all the time . I 'll be glad when it 's all torn down , then those fat bitches wo n't be able to stand around gabbing about people 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dig out for the expressway right through it , those goddam drunk Irish anyway ! Half of them are nuts . The niggers are moving in from down town and the Mexicans from the other side , so it 's going to be a hot time one of these days . Who do you hang around with from back there ? That Ramie Malone ? " " I do n't hang around with him or anybody . " " Who are your friends now , Jules ? " " I did n't come over to talk about them . " " Jules  --  " " Can I talk to Maureen ? " Loretta looked sadly at him . After a while she said , " Sure . But watch this kid , will you ? I mean , if he rolls over or anything . " She put the baby back in the crib ; it was neither awake nor asleep . It had a plump , dopey face , with surprised tufts of hair on its head . Jules thought her request was strange , that he should watch over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maureen 's room  --  was everything so precarious to her now ? She had seemed so reasonableall this time . She got up and went into the other room . Jules , uncomfortable , looked into the baby 's face . Furlong 's baby . Left behind for Lorettato raise . It slept and took in nourishment and even had a name  --  Randolph  --  and was much heavier than it had been the last time he 'd seen it ; so many babies being born ! On his way to this dump of a building he had seen a Negro girl of about fifteen chattingwith two Negro boys , toeing the sidewalk , passing the time of day , the boys with big knowing eyes and wild hair and the girl withdark merry face , about seven months pregnant , just passing the time of day out on the street . His mother 's remark about womenp228getting pregnant at the state hospital had startled him . He had never heard that . He 'd heard plenty of other things about that place and about the various jails , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Children 's Shelter overnight , he had gone through something terrible and he did not often let himself think about it , and he was a boy , a boy . What might happen to a girl he did not want to think about either . Enough had happened to Maureen already . Loretta leaned around the door . " Okay , " she said . " Come on in . She wants to see you . " The room was a shock to him : peeling wallpaper , plaster fallen out in queer patches , a light bulb fixed in a socket overhead . He felt suddenly very warm . Maureen , sitting up in bed , staring toward him , was also a shock . " Hi , Maureen , " Jules said . He held out the pot of flowers to her . When she gave no sign of noticing them he set them on the windowsill . " How are you ? " She stared at him . She was sitting up , propped against a pillow . The covers were drawn up around her though the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , worse than the hair he saw on broken-down women in the city , and her face had a puffed , plump , shiny look to it . It had been about a month since he 'd seen her last and in that short time she had put on a lot of weight . " She feels fine , " Loretta said . Loretta hovered behind him , moving the flowerpot on the sill . She went to the foot of the bed and tugged at the covers , trying to make them even . " Sit down , Jules , take a load off your feet , " she said , giving him a poke . Jules sat on the window sill . He looked toward his sister and tried to smile . Maureen was fumbling with something  --  not fumbling but just working her fingers on the edge of the blanket . Her fingers moved nervously but she herself was not nervous . She stared at him in a sleepy , steady way , unsurprised but rather cautious . I is might have recognized her had he seen her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a real nice day today , you should come outside , " Jules said . " I 'm going to buy a car with a top that comes down  --  " " A convertible ! " Loretta said , poking him again  --  he shouldn'tp229talk down to Maureen . " Is n't that nice , Reeny ? You always liked to go for rides . ' When it gets warmer he can take you out , huh ? " Maureen 's eyelashes seemed to flutter , yet she was not responding to her mother or to Jules . They waited , but nothing happened . She looked down at her fingers . Her face , once very pretty , was now gross and blemished ; blotches had come out on her forehead and cheeks . On her left cheek was a rash of pimples that was nearly solid . Jules stared at her and could not look away . " Say something , talk , tell her about yourself , " Loretta said . " Tell her about driving down to St. Louis . " " Yes , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . I 'm driving a man who 's in business down there , " Jules said hollowly . " I mean , he 's in business up here and needs to meet with someone down there . . . he 's paying me a lot . . . he wo n't ride on planes or trains . . . and . . . and he 's paying me a lot . " He stared at Maureen , and she looked toward him , but their eyes did not meet . He felt as if he were on the brink of a terrible revelation . Suddenly trembling , he felt for his wallet . It was there . He was relieved that he had n't lost it , that somebody had n't picked it out of his pocket . " I do n't want to forget to give you something , " he said awkwardly . He looked through the wallet . " You could probably use a little money . . . . Do you like this new place ? The apartment ? " " It 's okay , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this particular place ? " " To be nearer downtown , nearer the welfare place . You got to go down there and argue with them , you know .... " " It is n't dangerous around here ? " Loretta made a snorting , contemptuous noise . " You know what Detroit is , " she said , laughing . Jules tried to smile . He thought instead of this dump being broken open and the furniture in it  --  moved over the years from lace to place , faithfully  --  stolen by niggers and hillbillies , and Lottato would do nothing about it , would n't even notice . " How do they treat you at welfare ? " Jules said . " It depends if you get a bitch or not . Some of the guys are okay . can handle them . You just get there early and wait in line . But us one fat guy , he wears sunglasses out on the job and is real **28;10417;TOOLONG , and even in dire extremity she had enough stuff in her to be amused by them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " real class . " Jim smiled across the lounge at her ; he would really have to write a good show with her someday , if they did n't drown in a few minutes . " Well , " said Florence , " keep an eye out for those Indians . They are extremely sneaky . " " Yes , I know , " said Melody , " and do n't worry , we will . " She turned to Jim as Florence disappeared and put her hand sadly on his shoulder . " I kissed you a few times , anyhow . That 's something . Do you want to kiss me once more while she 's away ? " Jim was silent ; he was waiting for Florence to be gone . " We might as well , Jim . . . we wo n't be able to when she gets back . " " Let 's go in the life-raft closet , " said Jim . " Florence wo n't know we 're in there . " " The life-raft closet ? You mean . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stare in the direction of the shut door to the left of the bar , then turned back to Jim . " We ca n't do that . " " Why not ? Why ca n't we ? " " Well . . . " said Melody , her eyes intently on the closet door . " But what 's in there ? " " Nothing , " said Jim . " Deck furniture , cases of soda , life preservers . We can blow up the life raft and sit on it . Florence wo n't dream we 're in there , she 'll think we 've sneaked off to some stateroom . " " Blow up the life raft , " said Melody , eyes fixed on the closet door . She shook her head . " That does n't sound like a good idea to me . We ca n't do that . " " Melody , we 've got one chance in a hundred thousand . They 'll never find that island and if they do they 'll never launch a lifeboat and get it through that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you heard Florence . Please , let 's go in there before she comes back . " " But . . . that life raft . . . I do n't know . " " Melody , we 're going to drown and die ! I want to hold you in my arms  --  not make love to you , just hold you in my arms ! Please , darling , let 's go in the life-raft closet ! " Melody was silent for three seconds , then said : " All right . But promise you wo n't make love to me . " " I promise , " said Jim . " Come on , hurry ! " She was still reluctant and Jim had to pull her by the hand across the lounge to get her into the closet door . There was not much time.  |p201Florence  would be back any moment . As quickly as he could , he opened the door , pulled the hanging string to turn on the closet light , and bent down and spread out the rolled-up life raft . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a cylinder of gaswherewas the ring ? The thing would fill the entire closet and it had to be inflated before they went in there . " I ca n't find the ring ! " said Jim desperately . " Where 's the ring ? " It was impossible to wait another second ; Florence would walk in and everything would be ruined . He 'd have to inflate it while they were in the closet . Jim grabbed Melody 's hand to pull her into the little musty and low-ceilinged room , but she balked . " You promised ! Remember ! " " I know , come on ! " " No , promise me again ! Really promise ! " " I promise I wo n't make love to you , Melody . " " All right , " she said . Her knees were trembling as Jim led her into the closet and shut the door . They continued to tremble as Jim crawled around on the spread-out raft looking for the ring . " Help me find this thing , honey ! " said Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the raft and scrambled toward it and gave it a violent pull . At once , r0000F !  --  the life raft exploded into shape beneath his hands and knees like a giant mattress , shoving deck furniture to the wall and crowding against Melody 's legs . Jim looked up at her . " Are you all right ? " " Yes , " she said . Safe ! Florence would never guess they were in there . " Come sit by me , " said Jim . Melody stared down at him . Her knees were still trembling . She wet her lips and swallowed , fright in her eyes . " Remember , " she said , " you promised . " " I wo n't do anything but kiss you , honey , really I wo n't , " said Jim . " Come sit by me . " " All right , " she answered . Slowly , she pulled her legs free , stepped onto the inflated raft , and sat down beside him . Twenty minutes later , Jim and Melody lay on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies very close together . Melody 's dress and sandals and glasses were gone ; she wore only her bra and underpants . Jim was similarly unclad ; he had on his jockey undershorts and nothing else . Jim had intended to keep his promise , but it was impossible for him to do so . The feeling of her half-nakedp202body in his arms drove him wild . He felt a desire for her of a kind he never before had known in this world . Her body was beautiful beyond his dreams and he had abandoned his promise and was bent on makinglove to her . However , she was resisting to the best of her ability , although she too was in a waking coma of desire . She would not let him get anywherenear the panties ; she 'd permitted it in the lounge but evidently felt it was too dangerous , too much for her on the mattresslike raft . She was strong and would grab his wrist with a grip of iron if he tried to put his hand anywhere below her waist . Several times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had tried to take off her brassiere , but she would not allow that either , although her resistance was less in this area . He would get one hook of the bra unfastened , then she would reach around behind her and refasten it . How could he get the bra off ? She would n't be forced . The thing to do was to ask her to take it off herself . " Melody , take off your bra , honey . " " I ca n't . " " Please , darling . Take it off . " She took a deep breath , her nearsighted eyes staring into his . She could see him from this distance . A heavy sigh came from her . " Ca n't you just kiss me ? " she asked . " I want to see your breasts . Please , darling . " Another heavy sigh came from her as she stared into his eyes . " All right , " she said . " But not my pants ! " " No , not the pants , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , facing Jim and staring at him with an expression of pale fright . He could see the muscles of her arms move as she worked with her hands to undo the hooks , then suddenly the brassiere loosened and she slowly pulled the straps down over her arms . Even more slowly , she held out the bra in her fingers and dropped it off the raft , then sat staring gently at him , her shoulders back with a Hera grace . " You 're beautiful , Melody , " said Jim , who was moved almost to the point of tears . " You 're the most beautiful woman in the world . " And in the eyes of Jim Kittering , she was . Whether or not she carried too much weight , almost any judge of womanly beauty would have conceded she did have beautiful breasts . Although her breasts were very full , they were firm and stood forth on their own . Her nipplesand areolae , which were girlish rather than womanly , were tiltedp203slightly upward and the semicircles where her breasts joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rare women who needed a brassiere only for comfort and not for aesthetic reasons . Ten minutes later Melody said : " No , I wo n't take them off ! I wo n't ! I want to , you know I do , but I wo n't , I ca n't ! " " Melody , listen , " said Jim , " listen to me , honey . I know I promised , but it 's ridiculous . We 've got one chance in a hundred thousand of living through this , probably less . We 're going to drown and die , honey  --  they have n't found that island and they wo n't , and even if they do it wo n't make any difference . We 're going to die , darling  --  do n't deny us the only thing we have left ! " She began to cry . " But Jim . . . Jim . . . please do n't ask me , do n't ask me like that ! " " I want you , honey , I want you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , please do n't ask me or I 'll do it ! Please do n't ask ! " " Melody , the ship is going to sink ! " " But we ca n't be sure ! It might not ! " " Melody , God would understand this and forgive us even if it did n't sink ! But it will ! You have n't got a thing to worry about ! This ship is going to sink , Melody , I promise you it will , I guarantee it ! " " Oh , please do n't ask me ! I ca n't help myself either , do n't you understand ? " " Melody ! " said Jim with all the longing in his heart , and there was plenty of it . " I want to hold you in my arms ! " " All right , " she said . " I will . " Jim quickly took off his jockey shorts , a thing he had not done while she herself still had on her panties . Naked , he sat and watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over her knees , and off . Naked as the day she came a female child into the world , Melody lay there on the raft and stared up at him , an arm behind her head and tears still in her eyes . The moment of irresistible truth had arrived : a storm greater than Beulah had overwhelmed them and May Day was here . As Jim lay beside her , moved half on her body and put his hands on her breasts , she said : " God forgive me . I could n't help it , I could n't . . .. " Jim moved upon her , placed his hands on her shoulders , and lay his face between her breasts . " I love you so much , " he said . " Oh , Melody , Melody .... " Her body arched as she raised her pelvis hard against him andp204wound her arms around his back . " Oh , darling ! " she cried . " Jim , I love you ! ! " From somewhere , Jim heard another voice exclaim : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had heard Melody . Disaster ! Quickly , Jim propped on an elbow to put the Special on the air before the God 's Love Marching Society could cancel it again . But  --  too late ! " What in the name of Christ do you two think you 're doing ? " yelled Florence . " Get up off of there ! Get up this second ! " It was unbearable . For a brief instant the Special had almost flickeredinto a full picture , but the sound of Florence 's furious voice startledMelody and caused her to give a violent wrenching twist of her hips ; thus the flickering image swirled in upon itself and went out . To be so close , to be right there with the Special a tenth of a second from the air waves , to be pre-empted at the very last possible moment by another damnable Spectacular  --  it was intolerable . " Get the hell out of here , Florence ! " yelled Jim in a rage . " This is none of your goddamned business ! " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florence , you 're embarrassingme ! Go away , get out ! " " You goddamned fools ! " yelled Florence . " They 're lowering lifeboats ! Providence Island is three hundred yards away ! I 've risked my life to come look for you again ! Will you get up ? Will you ? " Jim and Melody for several seconds stared in stunned surprise at Florence , then frantically scrambled to their feet and simultaneously bent down again , heads turning from side to side as they looked desperatelyfor their clothes . " I ca n't find my dress ! " cried Melody . " I ca n't even find my pants , and where 's my bra ? " " I ca n't find anything either ! " cried Jim . Weirdly , their clothes seemed to have vanished . It was not so weird as it appeared . As they rep-loved their clothing bit by bit , they had placed it to the side of the life raft on the floor and the pitching of the ship had caused it to slide far back underneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time for clothes ! " said Florence . " They 've already got one lifeboat lowered and the other one 's half down ! " " But I ca n't go like this ! " exclaimed Melody in horror . " I 'm stark naked ! " " Will you please come ? " asked Florence , half crying . " They wo n't wait for us ! "  | " But . . . but I ca n't go naked ! " wailed Melody . " All those men ! " " They 've seen a naked woman before . Melody , please , I risked my life for you , ca n't you risk nudity ! " " She 's right  --  Melody , come on ! " said Jim . " Well . . . my panties anyhow  --  where are they ? " Florence shut her eyes tight and made fists of her hands . Then she looked at Melody and said calmly : " Melody , we can get to the beach if you 'll just come . We 're not only on the leeward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hurricane at this very minute and the sea is much calmer . The boats can make it through the reef ! Will you come , Melody , and save your life and mine and Jim 's too ? " " Yes , all right , " said Melody . " Hurry , for God 's sake ! " said Florence . As they rushed across the lounge , Jim saw weird and eerie sunshine through the lounge portholes . He also noticed that the wind had died down . The sea was still extremely rough , with giant waves and even more gigantic rolling swells . However , it was not as wild as it had been ; at least now it was possible to distinguish between the water and the air above it . A lifeboat could probably be lowered successfully if the ship did not take too bad a roll at the wrong moment . With tremendous luck , a lifeboat might even get through a reef . As they hurried toward the lounge door , which Florence in her haste had not stopped to fasten with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge swell and slowly pitched high in the sea and rolled over , over , over and down , down , down as a terrible rumbling and thunderous groan came from its bowels . Jim , Melody , and Florence fell to their hands and knees as the swinging lounge door slammed shut with a crash . " The wheat shifted ! " said Jim . " That 's the end of the lifeboats and the ship too  --  but there 's still a chance , we might be able to swim ashore if it is n't too far . " As he spoke , Jim crawled on his hands and knees down the steep incline of the lounge floor and grabbed the door and pulled at it . He could not open it . The damp and swollen plywood was stuck immovablyin the frame . " Help me ! " he cried . " Florence , you and Melody ! I ca n't get this thing open . " " It does n't matter , " said Florence in a hopeless tone . " We could never swim through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could try ! Come on , Florence , help me , damn it ! "  | " It wo n't open , Jim , " said Melody , who already was beside him and helping him pull at the knob . Melody was right . All three of them could not budge the door even a fraction of an inch . " Maybe we can get out of a porthole ! " cried Jim , who had an awful feeling of claustrophobia . To drown was bad enough , but to be trapped in that lounge and drown was downright horrible . And the ship could not float for long , tilted over at whatever horrible angle it was . The lounge floor was so steep Jim could barely get up it to the porthole over the sofa . " Impossible , Jim , " said Florence . " You ca n't get through that thing , it 's only about ten inches wide . " " I do n't think you can either , " said Melody . " Well , I can sure as hell try ! " Florence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the porthole open and managed to stick his head and neck through it , but the diameter was simply not large enough for his shoulders to pass . The sight he saw , however , took his mind off his claustrophobia . " There 's the island ! And one of the lifeboats upside down ! I can see the reef and an old wreck on it , and this thing  --  " Although the sun was shining with an eerie cheerfulness and a circleof blue sky was directly overhead , the sea was still very rough , with huge waves and even huger swells . The half-capsized Lorna Loone dipped down in a giant trough and Jim lost his footing on the slanted lounge floor and slipped from the porthole , almost falling all the way down on top of Melody and Florence . The observation that had been interrupted was that the ship , in some impossible crazy way , was still running and headed directly toward the reef . But on second thought he decided not to finish his sentence ; there was no point in terrifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still running somehow . I guess the propeller is still in the water and the engines are going , but there sure as hell is n't anybody up there on the bridge at the wheel . I saw one lifeboat turned over . " " It would n't have done us any good if we 'd gotten out , " said Florence . Jim stuck his head again through the porthole . The reef was much nearer ; some kind of powerful ground swell seemed to be carrying them swiftly toward it . It would all be over soon . He would say nothing to Melody and Florence until the last moment.  | " What do you see now ? " asked Melody . " There 's an old rusted wreck stuck on the reef , " said Jim . " You 'd swear it was a sister of the S.S. Lorna Loone . It looks as if it 's been there for years . " Jim also could see the so-near-and-yet-so-far island behind the barrierreef , which was roiling furiously in the heavy waves and giant swells . They could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an instant they would have been torn and broken into bits . The stupid stuck door had no meaning at all , really . Jim sadly shook his head in the porthole as he stared at the relativelycalm lagoon and the snowy white beach beyond it . In the calm of the eye of Beulah , the only sign of the storm that he could see on the island was a litter of coconut palm fronds on the beach and a number of coconut palms blown down . Beyond the beach he could see a parklike grove of coconut palms stretching toward a different type of vegetation that covered two fairly high hills , which looked like miniature versions of the Jungfrau and the Matterhorn . " And I see the island , " said Jim . " It looks very small , but it 's pretty . " " Too bad we 're not on it , " said Florence . " I 'm afraid we wo n't ever be , " said Jim quietly . " We 're going to hit the reef . " It was true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment he had thought the Lorna Loone would miss the reef and go back out to sea to an early watery grave , or maybe even steam on its side all the way to Bluefields in true Loony Goony fashion . A big wave had turned it briefly but a bigger wave had turned it back and it was now headed directly toward the reef about fifty yards to one side of the wreck . There was no point in watching . Jim lowered his head from the porthole and went down the slanted lounge floor to Florenceand Melody . " We 're going to hit , " he said . " But do n't be afraid  --  maybe we 'll stay on the reef like that old rusted wreck . " " I-low many of them do that ? " asked Florence with a wry smile . " I think we 'd better hold hands and get ready to die . " " Yes , I think so too , " said Melody . As Jim , Melody , and Florence reached out to hold hands and meet eternity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lounge by a tremendous , earsplitting , bonging crash . The S.S. Lorna Loone had veered and struck with terrific force not the reef , but the rusted wreckp208itself . The Loony Goony could n't even hit the side of a reef ! Jim , although half stunned and half blind from blood that had run into his eyes from his forehead , knew exactly what had happened . " It hit that goddamn wreck ! The stupid boat wo n't give us a chance at all ! It 's a pinhead , an idiot ! " Jim could hear Melody groaningloudly . " Melody  --  what 's the matter ? Are you hurt ? " " My behind , " she said , half crying . " I sat down on it very , very hard . Ohh , it hurts . . . 0000hh ! " Jim crawled over to her . Florence seemed to have vanished . Melody was half lying by the lounge door . She was , of course , still stark naked and had both hands clutched to her bare rear end as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Jim . " Roll over and let me look . " " No , I do n't want to . " " Melody , good grief , this is no time for modesty ! I want to see if you 're hurt . Roll over now . " Reluctantly she turned on her side and he pulled away her hands . Each round cheek of her behind had a reddish-purple bruise the size of a baby 's head . " You 're just bruised , " said Jim . " OOOOOh , it hurts ! " said Melody . " Hey , " said Florence as she crawled from under a table . " Why is n't the ship moving ? " " What ? " asked Jim . " The ship is n't moving . It 's perfectly still for the first time since we left Savannah . " Jim scrambled to his feet and climbed up toward the porthole . The angle was even steeper now ; he almost could not get up it . " We might be on the reef , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jim stuck his head through the porthole . Wind blew his hair ; a dark line was on the near horizon  --  Beulah was coming back , the eye was darkening , and soon would be gone on its way to Texas . The island was still there , the fronds of the palms now moving and the lagoon rippling . But the rusted wreck was gone , disappeared , vanished as if it never had been there . " Do you know what this cockeyed ship did ? " asked Jim . " It knocked that wreck off the reef and has taken its place . And we are well on it , too . The sea is very rough now and the ship is n't moving at all . Furthermore , when the storm comes back the wind will be reversed  --  thisside of the island will be the windward side ! Beulah will blow the Loony Goony even farther on the reef , maybe even into thep209lagoon and up on the beach ! We are going to survive ! We 're going to live ! " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florence begin to cry . Melody , however , did not cry . " That 's wonderful , Jim , just wonderful ! " she said . " But I am stark naked , I have got to find my clothes . Florence  --  do n't cry , come and help me look . They must be in that closet somewhere and I 've got to get dressed . " Florence replied , " Oh , to hell with your clothes , Melody . And to hell with his clothes too . " " I 've got to find them . We ca n't go around naked . This is awful . " " You are out of your bloody minds , both of you ! " said Florence . " I never saw the equal of such insanity in my life ! " " Neither did I , " said Melody . " Thank God you found us when you did  --  that 's all I can say , thank God you opened that door and stopped us before it was too late ! " " Yes , thank God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horrible ache of frustration , Jim was quite sincere . It was indeed fortunate Florence had discovered them when she did . However , the island seemed small and uninhabited . Would they perhaps be on it for a while ? And if so , would not the moral situation be altered ? As Jim watched Melody walk across the canted lounge with a naked grace , Florence put her freckled hand on his arm and turned her head toward him in the eerie light of the eye of Beulah . " Yes , " said Jim solemnly , " thank God you discovered us when you did . "  |p214working  myself half to death establishing a safe habitation on this island . Under such circumstances , I assure you Don Juan would not be running around at night playing a guitar below balconies with a red rose in his mouth , he would be home asleep , snoring . The women have worked very hard too , a bit reluctantly since they expected to be rescued in a day or two and saw no need for such effort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly like grasshoppers , if you do n't mind my saying so . The missionary 's wife is named Melody and the writer 's name is Florence . They are both rather remarkablewomen and I am lucky to be with them , although I really have had to bully them to make them do this work and I 'm sure in recent days they would have preferred the company of our pets to mine . As I said , we have a dog ( Rufus ) , a cat ( Joan ) and a parrot ( Robbie ) with us here  --  these were pets of the crew abandoned in the storm . The dog has proved useful in many ways , the cat catches an occasional bat in our cave home and otherwise does nothing , and the parrot says " Fock you " all day long in a Spanish accent . The writer Florence is a very sensitive , goodhearted , and homely woman with a considerable dry wit that seems to have been lost somewhat under the pressure of being stranded on this island . She once described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virgin . I 'm afraid she 's not looking to lose her virginity . She is a Lesbianand that is bad news for us on this island . She is not , thank God , aggressive  --  I mean she does not smoke cigars and growl . Actually , Florence is hard to make out , she 's quite feminine in many ways . I like her very much and to tell the truth I am worried about her . She seems to me very lonely and miserable and I am concerned about the problem her nature might cause us here . The thing worries me and I believe it worries Florence too . She goes off on solitary walks with the dog and seems frightened of me  --  she stammers , trembles , ca n't look at me , shrinks away . It was very bad a week or so ago . . . maybe she had her period or something . Recently , praise God , she has calmed down and is more like her old self . As for Melody , my other lady companion here  --  she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , I am afraid she is even more miserable than Florence . She bursts into tears at the bat of an eye , complains of stomach-ache , headache , backache , weakness and fatigue , and every other ache and pain you can think of . She has fits of temper , formidable temper  --  and believe me , when she 's angry she'sp215no one to trifle with . Florence is afraid of her when she 's mad , and so am I a little bit . But usually she does n't get angry , she cries . Say the least thing to her and her lip begins to tremble and she goes off and broods in a corner with the cat , petting it while the damn thing purrs in her lap . At least Florence takes walks , but Melody is miserable and wo n't let herself enjoy anything . The only pleasure she has is playing an accordion I found in a crewman 's cabin , but she seldom plays it . I guess she also enjoys her baths ; she is constantly on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the island  --  Florence calls it " Melody 's Bathtub . " She 's a study , this one . You 'd think it was Susanna in the Bible when she takes down that towel and says : " I ... am going . . . for my bath . " I guess the ostentatious announcementis to warn me not to sneak up there like an elder and peep on her . What else can I say about her ? She is a devout medical missionary 's wife and graduate registered nurse , devoted to her husband and I think well-married , although I gather they have some problems in some areas . ( The husband recently had to be flown from South Americato the Duke Medical Center with some " noncritical illness " and she has been very worried about this . ) What else ? She 's surprisingly broad-minded and liberal in some ways , very naive and narrowmindedin others . There 's a childlike quality about her , an innocence that usually is real and occasionally is affected . She can be startlingly intelligent at times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She will tell a lie and look you right in the eye like a child when she does it , but she is fundamentally truthful . She 's opinionated , intolerant , self-righteous , prudish , and almost pathologically modest . She 's feminine , emotional , gentle , sentimental , and extremely tenderhearted . I guess she is also passionate and sensual , and very ashamed of it . She is twenty-eight years old and although she dresses in a most unbecoming manner she is a very handsome , even beautiful woman with a full figure , a lovely smile , and deep blue eyes that never show cruelty even when she 's angry , and I believe that tells it all or most of it anyhow . So these are my two women , my two grasshoppers on this island . They still insist we will be rescued soon by fishermen , but their faith is waning and I myself see no likelihood of it . The island , I am afraid , is in the midst of absolutely nowhere . It is too tiny to be inhabited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , insufficient level ground for a landing strip , and I do not see what practical use it couldp216be to anybody at any time and I do n't know why anyone would come here . We might be on the place God knows how long , months or even years , until some wandering yacht or survey ship happens to come by . But neither Melody nor Florence will admit this as yet . They keep saying fishermen will come and that an alarm is out for the S.S. Lorna Loone and the Navy is looking for us . I do n't think so . The ship had no radio the last thirty hours and it sent no distress call . There 's no way the Navy or the Coast Guard could know within five hundred miles where this ship might be and I 'm sure they will merely assume it sank to the bottom of the ocean . Which it damn near did . Only an accident saved our lives  --  we were trapped ( or thought we were trapped ) in the ship 's lounge duringthe worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the passenger deck through the life-raft closet . It was lucky we did n't because the lounge was much the safest place for us . We huddled in there claustrophobically all night long while the wind screamed and almost blew the wreck off the reef . I had expected the wind would blow it up farther on the reef , but the wind did not blow straight toward the island but diagonally . The captain , a kind of drunken idiot , was supposed to be approaching the island leeward to the wind , he said so to Florence , but I think he got mixed up about the direction in which cyclonic disturbances revolve in the Northern Hemisphere ! At any rate , the returning wind almost blew us off the reef ; we could hear the hull scraping on the coral and feel the thing shuddering . The irony is we were n't trapped in there at all . The next morning , when I was struggling to open the jammed lounge door , it suddenly struck me there was an emergency exit behind the deck furniture in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but felt we were safer in the lounge ? Well , this is certain : if we had gone on deck during the storm we would have been blown overboard , and we probably would have gone on deck when the ship started crunching on that reef . I think I knew about the emergency exit but suppressed the knowledge out of an instinct for survival , an amazing thing when you stop to reflect on it . I wonder how many truths of vital importance we hide from ourselves  --  knowledge too painful , too dangerous , or too destructive ? Or knowledge we simply prefer not to face because we can not cope with it ? In any event , forgetting the emergency exit was a " fortunate "  |p217thing  . It was simple enough the next morning to move the deck furniture and open the door to the passenger deck . The ship is lying half on its side on the reef and the decks are so tilted it 's difficult to get around on it , which is one reason we 've had to move to the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe . And it is n't . ' We had to abandon the ship because of the danger that it might at any moment slide off the reef and go down God knows how far to the bottom of the ocean . There is no trace of the old wreck originally lodged on the reef . This island is of volcanic origin , a pinnacle mountaintop just breaking the surface of the sea . The reef is mostly very close offshore ; the wreck is only about eighty yards from the beach , and the lagoon is not much wider at the north end of the island , maybe two hundred yards or so . The water on the ocean side is dark blue and I 'm sure is very deep . The wreck is just hanging there ; it grates on the coral whenever a big wave or swell hits it . The fool ship may stay there for years , but it would n't surprise me to look out some morning and find it gone . Anyhow , we had to get off the wreck as soon as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the storm and I do n't think I could have launched or handled one of them in any case . We managed to squeeze the life raft through the door and get it out on the passenger deck and drag it along to the freight deck over to the lagoon side of the reef and launch it . The bow of the ship is across the coral and slanted down nearly to water level . We went in the hold and found a gigantic pile of cases of Dinty Moore beef stew , plus a smaller pile of cases of grapefruit juice . We took three cases of the stew and three cases of the grapefruit juice and lugged them up on deck and put them in the raft and paddled the thing across the lagoon to the beach , and thus we were delivered to the shores of Providence Island where we now abide in chaste Christian love and reasonable comfort . Since we first stepped out of peril onto the island , I have made I do n't know how many trips back and forth hauling food and supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know ; all I know is that it 's the hardest work I 've ever done . Paddling ashore is nothing , it 's the hauling that damn near killed me . It 'd be brute labor at best and the difficulty of getting around on the canted decks makes it infinitelyworse . I 'm simply not used to such physical exertion and for most of the past three weeks have gone to bed every night so exhaustedI could barely hold my head up . Well , chaste Christian love kept me going , plus no alcohol , no to/bacco . Yes , that 's right  --  not only do we have no sex on this island , we have no cigarettes and no whisky ! On the second morning Melody played a diabolical trick on Florence and me . While Florence and I were crawling through the crew 's living quarters , the pious little bitch threw every bottle of rum , gin , and whisky overboard , then capped it off by throwing all the cigarettes overboard too ! Florence and I were so infuriated we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she was trying to help us . However , believe it or not , both Florence and I are glad she did it . I have come to think it was the right thing to remove alcohol from the scene here . Besides which , I feel better than in years . Imagine it  --  no cigarettes and nothing to drink for three weeks ! Fantastic ! I feel fifteenyears younger and am amazed by the energy I have . I sleep better , see better , the smoking cough is all gone  --  it 's like being out of jail . I do n't need sleeping pills here or push pills either , and figure I have lost about ten pounds ; am sun-tanned , healthy  --  you would n't know me . Of course , being so healthy and everything does have its drawbacks , such as frustrato terrifico . Chaste Christian love is subtle ; it builds you up and then tears you down . I 've noticed it especially these last couple of days , which we have spent resting from our labors . The mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this since I was sixteen . Do you know something ? It has been one month since I 've had any contact with humanity 's better half and that 's incredible . However , as someone once said , " sex is n't the most important thing in life , " and if you do n't believe me ask our pets  --  they are all celibatesand do n't seem to mind it a bit . The women love the animals beyond belief and I am glad for their sake we have them . I found two of them on one of my early trips back to the wreck our first day here , the dog and the parrot  --  the cat turned up next day meowing in a cupboard in the galley . Florence , who gives names to everything , calls the dog " Rufus " on the grounds that he looks like her editor in New York . She has an awful-looking editor if that 's true . I 'd thought I heard a dog whining even before we left the ship and when I went back I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He heard me while I was poking around the ship and began to bark . The parrot was cursing in the next cabin . He has a very filthy tongue , this bird , and says a number of things but mostly a tiresome , Spanish-accented " Fock you "  --  it 's croupy and indistinct and Melody kept asking , " What 's he saying ? " Ip219finally explained it to her . She eyed the bird with compassion and interest . " Why , the poor thing , " she said . " How could anybody be so mean ? I 'll have to teach it some nice words . " Florence calls the parrot Robert E. Lee for some reason . As I said , she 's a namer . The cat was singed in the radio-shack fire and she calls it Joan of Arc . The way the women carry on over these pets is slightly disgusting , but I suppose they are frightened to be stranded here and the animals reassure them or something . I 'll admit the dog has earned his keep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he seems part Irish setter , part standard poodle , and part God knows what . He is a kind of brindlecolor and has woolly jaws and a solemn expression . As Florence says , he is a serious dog , an intellectual and thinking dog . The animal means a lot to her and he certainly has been helpful . He has twice caught and killed iguanas and four days ago caught a small , wild pig . Much more important , he also discovered " Morgan 's Treasure Cave " and a fresh-water spring . Not much water and even less treasure , but some water anyhow and the cave gives us our happy little home where we abide together in chaste Christian love on Providence Island . Maybe it really is Providence Island , but if so the Puritans were out of their minds to try to found a colony here . It is a tiny place more or less circular , with a reef on one side and jagged , rough rocks on the other . The reef is on the easterly or windward side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly all the time . The climate here for the most part is Paradise Type One  --  balmy , mild , dreamy tropical , with some rain in heavy quick showers . The surroundingwater is very beautiful ; you know , of course , the jewel-like greens and blues of the water of the Virgin Islands far to the east of here . . . well , this water seems to me even more beautiful , though I suppose it is about the same as that of St. John or Magen 's Bay . The eastern side of the island is much more lush than the Virgins , however . It rains here more and we have found ( or rather , the dog found ) a small fresh-water spring and pool at the foot of the southern hill . The little beach is one of the best I have seen anywhere . Imagine a perfect crescent of sand and fantastic emerald water that is crystal clear , with a beautiful coconut-palm grove in the background . But the most striking feature of the beach , aside from the incredible water of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overlooks a little horseshoecove at the northern end . The cliff is only a few yards from the beach and even has a huge shade tree on a small knoll at its base . It 's a very beautiful island and would make a fabulous location for a mod/ern resort hotel of the kind that has ruined so many islands in this sea , but since the only way to get here is by small boat , I guess it will be spared until Detroit perfects a practical flying saucer . The basic topography of the island consists of two good-sized hills with a " meadow " in between . The hills , especially the northerly and more rugged one , are covered with dense bushes , cacti , and a few trees  --  mahogany trees , Florence says , although who knows what they are . The lower land between the beach and the hills  --  on the eastern or windward side of the island  --  has a beautiful parklike grove of coconutpalms , which I do not think are native to the Caribbean and therefore must have been planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first that maybe workers would come here to " harvest " the coconuts ; on one of my shows we had a commercial showing this , the " copra " and how they get the oil and make shampooout of it , and how the natives go out every six months singing songs and so forth . I was sure for about a minute this place was a coconut farm . But no  --  we 'd see the piled-up debris of previous such " harvests , " big ratty piles of coconut choppings , and we 'd also see spur markings up the palms from being climbed . There 's no indicationthese palms have been touched for years or even decades . I think the trouble is there 's no harbor and only a tiny opening in the barrier reef . The leeward or westerly side of the island is rocky , barren , and impossible to reach by any kind of boat . There is no reef ; the entire coastline of this side of the island is made up of piled , jagged , face-of-the-moon rocks . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes it and goes over there with Rufus . But to sum up , I do not see how any boat other than a very small one could possibly make a landing on this island . ' We call the two hills the Matterhorn and the Jungfrau  --  my own small contribution to local place names . The cave is located about two-thirds up the one we call the Jungfrau . The other hill , the Matterhorn , has a great deal of prickly cacti and many bushes all over it and we have not explored it too much . But I do n't think anything is up there , it is just a hill . It does have a magnificent view from the rock ledge on top , an odd sofa-shaped formation Florence calls " Morgan 's Armchair . " It 's closer to the beach and the lagoon than the Jungfrau . The view is of the lagoon and it is spectacular . You can also see the northern end of the island , including the little crater-shaped pool known as Melody 's Bathtub . ( In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking her bath , so I guess an elder did peep on Su/sanna after all . Not intentionally , however . I was up there looking for a ship or a sail and happened to glance down and see her . She has a figure that can be recognized some distance away . ) The other hill , the Jungfrau , is to the south of the island and is slightly larger but not nearly so steep and rugged and bushy . It has a plateaulike summit of rounded rock we call " Morgan 's Pillow . " The view from here is also magnificent , a spectacular panoramic vista of the entire island but especially the narrower part of the lagoon , the palm grove , and the southern and western rocks . There 's a freaky feature down at the south end of the island , a sort of blowhole channel eroded through solid rock . It 's inland fifty feet or so but connects subterraneously to the sea . When a big wave comes ashore , air is caught and compressed and all of a sudden , Wh0000sh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly air . If you hold out a palm frond , the blast will snatch it right out of your hand and blow it fifty or sixty feet in the air . It makes a kind of " thoomping " noise and the effect is a bit like the Jolly Green Giant suddenly and mightily breaking wind . Florence calls this " Morgan 's Asshole , " to Melody 's horror . " Oh , what a name , " she says . " Oh , what a vulgar remark , Flor-ence . " Her priggishness provokes me sometimes . She is always criticizing me and Florence for our filthy language . I am often tempted to shake her up , really shock her , suggest to her that language is not filthy  --  only man 's inhumanity to man is filthy . " Now Melody , every person has an asshole , even Morgan , even you . " I 'm afraid it would just make her cry . Her modesty is even more ridiculous and exasperating than her priggishness . You should see the clothes she wears  --  full-length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially hate , a pale gray thing she had on when I first met her . However , both these women are almost pathologically modest  --  Melody out of prudery and Florence out of shame at her lack of voluptuousness . My favorite spot on the island is the little horseshoe cove under the cliff not far from the big tree on the knoll . I often swim there , but neither of the women will swim with me . Florence sometimes sneaks down the beach and swims by herself , but Melody , never  --  she has no suit and is too modest to borrow Florence 's , which she says is too small for her . Madness . Such shame at the appearance and image of the human body is pathetic . ( However , Melody 's modesty is weakening . She has lately begunp222sleeping with her pajama tops unbuttoned at night and her breasts bare . Florence gets more modest , though . The other day by accident  --  and believe me , it was an accident  --  I happened to intrude on her when she was naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The irony , surprisingly enough , is that Florence has a rather pretty figure , sort of like a young girl  --  little breasts and everything , including hips more feminine than you 'd think to look at her in the mannish suits she wears . Of course , she has freckles all over and she is kind of thin . I 'm not saying she 's Sophia Loren . But physically she 's a woman , there 's no doubt about it . As for Melody , there 's no reason on earth for her to be ashamed of her body . They are both nuts . To see the blushing and the gasping is enough to make a man become a philosophical nudist . ) I keep getting off on my grasshoppers . It is now night and before it gets too late I want to write you about " Morgan 's Treasure Cave . " We found it , or rather Rufus found it , our first day ashore . Inspired by the affection shown him by the women ( Florence actually hugged him and kissed him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , the dog went racing all to hell over everywhere and after a while commenceda terrific ruckus . Florence went to see what was going on and found him in a goodsizedcave barking at some tiny bats that were swooping all over the place . I lighted a palm frond and smoked out the bats and we have been living in the cave ever since , which Melody decided at once was probably where Morgan buried his treasure  --  thus the name , " Morgan'sTreasure Cave . " It was a very fortunate discovery , because the cave gives us ideal shelter . It is cool during the day and it is dry . I think this is the rainy season because it rains like hell on the island once or twice a day  --  clouds suddenly accumulate and down she pours like cats and dogs for half an hour , then it 's all over and the sun comes out . I do n't know what we would have done for shelter if Rufus had not found the cave , because the fact is , even in Paradise one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The entrance to the cave is large but half hidden by bushes and I do n't know if we would have found it without Rufus . Maybe , but the entrance is not all that easy to see even though it is big enough to drive a car through . The cave consists of one large chamber about forty feet long and varying from twenty to twenty-five feet wide , endingin a very narrow opening that leads on , I suppose , to more cave ,  |p223but  we can not get in there and neither can the dog . The cat goes in there but does n't report anything back to us about it . A few bats still try from time to time to go back in there  --  we have swatted and killed most of them  --  and the cat chases in after them and catches them and eats them . During these past three weeks , until a couple of days ago we were constantly hauling food and supplies from the wreck and have rigged up a home here and it is not too bad . Our " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cave as you enter , where the ceiling slopes down fairly low . I have my " room , " and Florence and Melody have theirs , a bit bigger than mine , and we also have a " living room . " We have strung ropes and draped blankets over them so as to form partitions , which provide at least a little privacy , if not much . You 'd be amazed at the effort required to do this and I 'm afraid I 've had to bully the women slightly in order to get them to help me . They kept saying we 'd be rescued any day now and there was no need to wear ourselves out . Frankly , although women are wonderful and I love them , it can be aggravating to be stuck on an uninhabited island with a couple of them . It 's hair-raising , the struggle I have explaining the simplest thing to them , such as : " Suppose we are n't rescued any day now ? " Since the wreck could have gone off the reef at any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies off it as soon as humanly possible . We are now , thank God , comfortably settled , the brute toil is over . I have hauled enough food from the wreck to last us for years  --  most of it , eccch , Dinty Moore beef stew ( we are already sick of it ) . We have real mattresses , sheets , and blankets and even a few modest pieces of furniture , all of which I managed to transport on the life raft . Morgan 's Treasure Cave is quite cozy , you might even call it " homey . " It is late and I am tired . I am typing these pages on Florence 's portable typewriter , which she insisted on lending me even though she is writing something herself . I have for light a kerosene lantern and I am staring at a blanket partition on the other side of which is the women 's " bedroom . " Not much of a partition  --  the blankets do n't really hold together too well . And not much of a bedroom either  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clothes hanging on railroad spikes driven in the wall . Well , it 's not the Ritz and it 's not a Y.W.C.A. dormitory . No , it 's Morgan 's Treasure Cave , piled and stacked high with the preciousp224wealth of chaste Christian love . Yes , indeed , wall to wall and floor to ceiling , we have it here , the thing men seek and seldom find , a pricelesstrove of pure , uh-huh , love . And I 'm getting slightly fed up with it , too . I suspect I am not the only one who is getting weary of chaste Christian love , if you want to know the truth . The women also have a kerosene lantern and they are awake . Florence , I believe , is writing a poem . Melody earlier in the evening was writing something too , but the last time I peeked through the blanket she was reading the Bible , propped on a pillow with her pajama tops unbuttoned and her breasts bare . As I said , her modesty is weakening . She was aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Bible , stared in pale silence toward the blanket partition , and made no effort to cover herself . Tonight at dinner she reached across me for salt and leaned her breast against my arm . She did the same thing at lunch , a bit less obviously . It has been apparent for about a week she is even more sick and tired of chaste Christian love than I am . She is trying in a rather transparent way to seduce me and if she keeps on she is going to succeed gloriously . A small thing , not of too much significance perhaps , but not altogetherreassuring either . I happened to wake up early this morning and peeped through the blanket and found Florence in bed with Melody . They were both sound asleep , both naked from the waist up . It was a touching little tableau . Melody was asleep on Florence 's shoulder and Florence had her arms tenderly around her . I 'm sure there was nothing " Lesbian " about it , at least not on Melody 's part ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened . But I do n't think Florence 's feelings were altogether sisterly . She , too , I have no doubt , is sick and tired of chaste Christian love . Let 's face it : chaste Christian love is the greatest , but it gets tiresomeafter a while . That 's the truth , Linda . Of the two hundred monkeys that roam this earth , 199 of them are hairy and mate by the moon ; the other is hairless and mates by the stars . I certainly agree with your favorite truism that " sex is not the most important thing in life , " but let 's be sensible , it is not the least important thing either . In fact , after food and shelter , I 'd say it rates fairly high on a list of human needs , would n't you agree ? Of course we have successful celibatesin this world , a few of them , but I think a sex life even without love is essential to the mental and spiritual health of nearly all men and women . Combined with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fundamental to life as oxygen is fundamentalp225to blood . I know this is true as far as I am concerned and I am sure it is equally true of Melody and Florence . Therefore , from a strategic point of view , I wonder how long chaste Christian love can or should endure in Morgan 's Treasure Cave ? I am very tired and very depressed . Have read through this letter and apart from my description of the island  --  which is harmless enough if not too inspired  --  I 'm afraid it 's impossible . The difficulty is n't just the collapse in the last few paragraphs ; the entire letter is impossible . A pinhead could read my comments on Melody and know I love her and she loves me , that we are both half crazy with desire and on the very verge of the sin of sins  --  all of that was plain even earlier in the letter , and it is not a matter I had intended to discuss with my wife . Well , the fact is , I am in a serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should do . I guess I have just wanted to " talk " to somebody about it . After all , I ca n't talk to Melody or Florence and the parrot only says nasty things to me . It is not a simple problem . Perhaps it sounds like a simple problem  --  the magazine cartoon of man and blonde on a spit of sand beneath a palm implies a total and delightful absence of responsibility , and I guess for that reason is a common daydream of men and of many women . Whee , perfect license , and inevitable , too ! Imagine any woman you like on that spit of sand beneath the palm  --  she 's yours . Imagine any man you like  --  he 's yours . The most beautiful or handsomemovie star thus becomes the plausible lover of a pimple-faced stockroom clerk or a fiat-chested secretary . However , I am afraid there is no such thing as total and delightful absence of responsibility , not if you stop to think for a moment . The truth about the situation here , painful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love affair between Melody and me on this island could destroy her marriage and her life . Unless we assume we will be here forever  --  an unreasonable assumption  --  that is the grim reality and it must be confronted . In the first place , she 'd probably get pregnant , we have no means of preventing it exactly . Suppose she goes to her husband three months from now , six months from now or a year from now , either pregnant or with a baby and he says , " Jezebel ! ' Whore of Babylon ! " and throws her out ? And he might react in just that way . From what she tells me , he is naive and has problems and fears about sex . But he is a good man and loves her and is a well-suited husband for her . And she loves himp226too  --  not romantically , the way she does me , perhaps , but she loves him in a human way that might even be deeper really . Would n't it be very sad and even tragic for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little effort and sacrifice to prevent such a thing , especially since  --  who knows ?  --  we may be rescued from this island tomorrow or next week ? Florence is another reason to leave Melody alone . As things stand , I believe Florence can control herself , but what would happen to her if I were living and sleeping with Melody in the enforced intimacy and lack of privacy of Morgan 's Treasure Cave ? We all must have shelter , there is nowhere else for us to go or Florence either , and we could not send her away alone even if there were . It 's a slightly clinical but unavoidable thought : a man and woman can not make love in utter silence  --  Florence would hear the kisses , the sighs , the heavy breathing , and all the sounds of love . How could she stand such a thing ? I do n't think she could . It would be the torments of Tantalus for her , when she herself has nothing , nothing at all but her dog Rufus to keep her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what would happen . It would be unbearable for her and sooner or later she would go to Melody . . . and who knows what the consequences of that would be ? There 's no predicting , but I 'm convinced the greatest danger would be to Florence herself . Whatever her fears or foibles , she is a hypersensitive , highly emotional , and very intelligent woman . No matter what happened as the result of some kind of " pass " at Melody , Florencewould be in trouble . Perhaps there are more feminine women who are less homosexually inclined than Melody , but if so , I have never met one ; I 'm sure she does n't even know what a " Lesbian " is , not really . Almost certainly she would be appalled and shrink back in horror , in which case Florence would face total isolation . On the other hand , Melody is very tenderhearted and I suppose it is possible she might briefly tolerate a certain amount of " unnatural " behavior out of pity . I do n't think Melody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think Florence could either . I believe she has severe conflictabout her " Lesbianism . " Maybe I am wrong , maybe she would feel no guilt at all , no remorse on my account or Melody 's , but I had a dream last night Florence killed herself , I dreamed I found her broken and bleeding body on the rocks of the western shore of this island.  |p227I  am afraid the argument in favor of chaste Christian love is overwhelming. 1 ) An affair between Melody and me would probably wreck her marriage and thereby wreck her life as well . At the same time , 2 ) , such an affair would subject Florence to unbearable pressure that probably would lead to some kind of an emotional breakdown and perhaps even worse . The situation on this island is a variation on Don Juan in hell  --  the Don with a conscience , the Don looking ahead at the consequences of his acts . I think the best thing for me to do would be to castrate myself as quickly and painlessly as possible . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the last crucial pages of it twice . I have also thought about this entire dilemma for a sweaty half hour and I see no way out . The argument is irrefutable . I have locked poor Don Juan in hell and thrown away the key . An affair between Melody and me would in all likelihood wreck her marriage , and such an affair would put unbearable pressure on Florence . I find no justification to risk wrecking that marriage and also risk driving an emotionally crippled woman to self-destruction . The Don must burn . Well , it will be an achievement of sorts to go down in history as the man who was shipwrecked on an uninhabited island with an attractive , passionate , loving woman and could n't get laid . Yes , that will be a record . They will shoot , so to speak , at that record for a long time . Or am I being a bit masochistic about this thing ? Am I making a real moral evaluation or am I punishing Don Juan for his previous crimes ? Would chaste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and me , and is the argument in its favor a rationalizationto avoid rather than accept human responsibility on this island ? Am I reacting to Melody and Florence not as the human beings they really are but as ghosts of a red-haired bridesmaid in a boathouse and a wife driving away in the rain ? Or was I right to begin with ? Are the above questions a half-formed but cunning rationalization to get the Don out of hell ? Is chaste Christian love , horrible and absurd though it is , the only moral answeron this island ? I do n't know . Why did I ever sit down in that living room and start thinking about that squid and his goddamn shell ? I guess the answer is fairly obvious and I 'm afraid the irony of thisp228letter has long since become apparent . I do n't want to hurt these women , I want to help and protect them both . I want to do the right thing , I really and truly do , but I do n't know what it is . And so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow , in a letter I can not mail , to tell me what is right . The truth is there is no one to tell me . The day has come when I have to decide it for myself . Blonde , blue-eyed , beautiful Linda , are you there ? I wo n't destroy this . The day may also come when you should and must read these words . Until then , I send you my love from Morgan 's Treasure Cave . Dear Diary : This beautiful Sunday on the island finds me depressed and badly bewildered . " Mysterious machine of the mind , " indeed . An almost Mandarin tact guides him . Yes , an Oriental subtlety . I ca n't keep up with him , I admit it , he has me confused . Although I am sure he does not believe in the Dragon , he insists on pretending he is worried about an " unnatural " interest on my part in Melody , whom he continuesfor some obscure reason to torment with loving chastity . The son of a bitch is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrailsI examined recently , this is what he really thinks : " There is no Dragon , Florence , no Dragon at all . Dragons need belief in order to live and I do n't believe in yours . I have looked into your heart and I know what is there . The more I mockingly pretend to believe in the Dragon , the more I talk with you of the mysterious machine of the mind , the more I stare at you with pain and sympathy and an amusement that is not cruel . . . the more the Dragon sighs and cries and dies . " Speaking of Dragons , a tawny-haired , ferret-eyed , small-minded girl named Verta Killington Rhabb told me an interesting filthy story several years ago about a couple of Dragons living in a stinky den down in Hell 's Half Acre and I would like to tell you that story now , dear Diary , except it 's too filthy and ghastly and awful . The story itselfp229is n't so bad  --  the Vaseline and the blood and the semen do not bother me much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedy suddenly contains a grain of truth and that 's unendurable . As Tolstoy said to Gorky : " You ca n't write that ! " Gorky had told him about a drunken peasant woman with her skirts up and urinating all over herself in a railroad station while her children watched in horrified shame . It was filthy and ghastly and awful , and kind of funny in a gruesome way , just like Verta Killington Rhabb 's tale about the Dragons . " You ca n't write that , it 's too dreadful , " said Tolstoy . But then he reconsidered and declared : " No . You must write that . " Oh , to hell with it , it 's too filthy . What do the Russians know about it , anyhow ? They 're great when it comes to political theory , but they just never could get the hang of fiction . As the old lady said as she took her son-in-law 's eyeballs out of the refrigerator , " Life is hard enough as it is , without reading about nasty people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any Dragons , except maybe a few . Since there are a few , I will describe the Dragon 's abode . That is as close as I will allow myself to approach the revolting subject , unless the temptation to tell an interesting filthy story overwhelms me against my better judgment . On the western side of the island , iguanas run and hide among purple rocks and little wild pigs hunt sure-footed on jumbled boulders for shellfish in the sea  --  uggch , terrible . On the barren western coast of this lost speck in the sea , iguanas scurry on lizard business and little pigs crunch decaying clams in rocky pockets as foam spreads over trotters balanced in a delicate precision  --  uggch ! Are you crazy or something , some kind of nut ? Simple !  --  the way is not " Look , Daddy , the Dragon lives here ! " but rather , " Father dear , can you detect a faint scent of sulphur ? " Decaying clams , indeed . Might as well say rotten seafood . Try again , please . Concentrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that ought to inspire you . After all , look what he said about the girl on Cape Cod : " A strange book for you to write , Florence . The girl was so lonely , so terribly lonely , and you do n't seem lonely to me at all . " Mao himself could n't top that , it 's out of Fu Manchu 's league . But never mind , once again , please . Concentrate and keep it simple . On the dead western shore , iguanas scuttle and little pigs splash in rocky pockets of the sea . The dog loves this desolate land , in particu/lar the stone promontory at the northwestern end of the island . He barks , he runs , he plunges into small rocky pools and shakes his coat in the sunshine . It gives us much joy and relief , this area of desolation where roaring waves cascade ashore and form rock-bound ponds in which mute iguanas and little pigs wade . The song is there but I ca n't recognize the melody . Ah , well , c'est @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so love such words as scurry , scuttle , cascade , and promontory ? Why is this , dear Lord , who made us all and gave us our foolish nature and character , along with our hopeless and absurd wishes and wants ? " The great writer is not afraid of banality , " said Tolstoy . Me , I 'm terrified of it . That 's why I write occasionallywith artful cleverness and never with Tolstoyan power . I have known the limits of my gift for three years . But then , writing has never been enough for me , I have always been miserable . I call it " Hell 's Half Acre " and a strange mansion rises there , a most peculiar dwelling place lonely and made of dead rock ; the architecture is odd , windows it has none , and neither warmth nor water , just a dark and gloomy den , that 's all , a suitable place for a Dragon to hide and snort occasional preternatural smoke or even once in a while blow a breath of reluctant fire at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a living and breathing woman able to bring into the world a Tolstoy or a Beethoven or just a normal human child . . . but satisfactory to a Dragon . " Absurd "  --  another word I got from him , among many . I find myselftalking like him , thinking like him , joking like him , stretching in the morning like him , sighing at sprinkled diamonds in the night sky like him  --  I do everything like him , except love Melody like him . I got very annoyed with her this morning , partly , I suppose , because of guilt about last night but mostly because of her unbearable misplacedcompassion . I have a neurotic fixation on him , certainly ; I had that even as long ago as Savannah . I do n't deny the fixation , I do n't even deny a certain amount of perverse sexual attraction ; I dreamed last night , as I have dreamed repeatedly , that I was naked in his arms and he was kissing me and about to make love to me . So much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endure him to touch me . It 's idioticto consider my neurotic fixation an equivalent to her romantic and unqualified love for him . But that 's what she did . I was laughing this morning at something he had said , something very funny  --  and he can be very funny  --  and Ip231caught her staring pensively and rather sadly at me . She knew what I was laughing at but she asked me anyhow and I told her and she said : " You like him very much , do n't you ? " I am afraid I gave her an icy stare and replied : " The son of a bitch reminds me of my brother and my father rolled into one . You might not mind being called a grasshopper , ' Melody , but I resent it . And I resent the way he has bullied us and ordered us around and worked us half to death , you with your period last week and bad cramps and me with broken ribs not even completely healed . He 's a hateful bully and he 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm not any woman . I 'm not his grasshopper and I 'm not his slave either . As for liking ' him , I 'll be glad to get off this island and see the last of him , if you want to know . " It bothered her all morning . Melody is the kind of woman who wo n't change her mind once she 's got a notion in her head . " Dear Florence , " she says to me at lunch , my hand in hers and tears in her eyes , " I do love you , please always be my friend . " What a pain in the ass she is . That sweet compassion of hers is too much to endure , all the more so since it 's so godawful authentic ; she does love me and her tears of sympathy were real , if misplaced and inappropriate . Oh , yes , they were real and her sweet compassion is godawful authentic  --  exceptwhen she 's having one of her frustration fits , and lately that 's damn near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a woman so frustrated . It has made her physically ill . I wonder if she knows enough to masturbate , and fantastically enough I 'm not even sure she does . Incroyable ! Le degouttement tres pathetique ! Le petit jugement dernier n'est pas la grand airelle ! Well , I never hear her snorting  --  if she does , she 's awful furtive and sneaky about it-. - but then , she would be . I almost think she just lies there and cries . Maybe she does n't know how . Maybe " Self-Abuse : Its History and Practice " is not included in the curriculum at Tom Armour University . I am sure she must have picked up the arcane skill somewhere ; the truth , of course , is that it helps very little . The scene with her last night was pitiful ; even this cold reptile heart was moved . Poor darling , poor thing ; how can I even pretend to laugh at her , knowing as I do she would never laugh at me . . . and there 's more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So much more , it is . . . " absurd . " Yes , I got that from him . He uses the word in a special way . To him it makesp232sense . In idiotic foolishness lies truth . A mysterious machine , the mind , he says , a strange mysterious machine , the workings of which we ourselves can not follow . We talked an hour about it yesterday . I love to talk to him . I want to scream if he touches my hand , but I love to talk to him . Neurotic fixation is putting it mildly . The sound of his voice gives me pleasure . I never tire of talking to him , never , but if he touches my hand I want to scream and jump in the sea . I wonder why that is . If he touches Melody 's hand , she does n't want to scream and jump in the sea . On the contrary , she wants to scream and jump in the sea because he does n't touch her hand . And " jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know my own dark impulses on that promontory ; and two days ago , when Melody walked with me there , she paled with fright as she stared at the rocks and roiling waves , locked her arm in mine , and said : " I have an urge to jump . Do n't let me . " It 's absurd . Yes , " absurd . " I have an impulse to die for fear he will , she has an impulse to die for fear he wo n't . And yet she naively thinks my feelings are identical to her own , that I love him and want him just as she does . She is half right , and half right is not right enough . I only love him and want him in my dreams , and dreams are not and never can be reality . Furthermore , if my interpretation of the sheep 's entrails is correct , then he is not half wrong , he is totally wrong . The Dragon lives and blew a breath of fire not twenty-four hours ago  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Speaking of Dragons , an orange-haired , weasel-eyed , and rather stupid girl named Verta several years ago told me an instructive story about a pair of them living down in the Village . They were happy in a Dragon kind of way , but after a while the more " feminine " of the two decided their life was a bit empty and unfulfilled and they ought to have a baby . The " masculine " one was badly upset at first and snorted smoke , but after considerable discussion in the den became enthusiasticand agreed it was a hell of an idea , that a darling little baby Dragonwas just what they needed around there to bring a little cheer to the place , to light up its shadows . Of course the process of obtaining a little baby Dragon would be a horrible ordeal , but with fortitude and a few tranquillizers it could be endured . So the Dragons went to a bar and found a young drunk sailor boy and picked him up and lured him to the den . They got him down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death of those ghastly Dragons and his thing wouldn'tp233work . Nope , his thing was intimidated , scared silly . It was a distressingsituation . The " feminine " Dragon , who had a good figure and was pretty , sat on him naked and everything but it only terrified him worse . She kissed him on the mouth , not passionately but on the mouth  --  no result . She took his hand and put it on her breast  --  no result . She squatted on him , rubbed on his thing , and bounced on him like she was riding a horse  --  no result . His eyes just opened wider and wider . He finally began half crying and the Dragons decided he was too young and let him go . But they were n't ready to give up , hell no . The next sailor was older and less drunk , but he got nervous too when they came at him . Of course , Dragons do n't know anything about feminine wiles and besides , they wanted to get right down to business . At first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masculine " one grabbed him by the belt to take off his pants and the " feminine " one started unbuttoning her blouse , he began to talk and mutter about " getting back to the base , " and tried to saunter toward the door , sweating , his eyes bugging slightly . . . they had to wheedle him and pull him back and give him a lot more to drink , quite a lot more , and even then it was an awful struggle . The " masculine " one had to hold him while the " feminine " one got on him . At first his thing would n't work either , but she kept sitting on him and rubbing on him and finally it did . The " masculine " one ran to get some Vaselineand then commenced the agony of the " feminine " one  --  000h , it killed her , it was so big , but she was determined and kept sitting on it and pushing down and she finally got the horrible thing all the way in her . The sailor became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was painful to her , but she gritted her teeth and endured it even though it seemed he would keep it up forever . Then suddenly he groaned and moved harder and she felt baby Dragon stuff coming out of his thing and going into her . Eureka ! A triumph ! But alas , no luck . It all ran out in that position , she could feel it down her leg , and though the " masculine " one hurried and got a spoon and they tried to scoop it off her thigh and get it back in , they could n't , it was all mixed with Vaseline and blood and most of it got lost . While they were trying to spoon the baby Dragon stuff back into her , the sailor grabbed his pants and ran out the door and staggered down the stairs . Well , the Dragons decided sailors were no good , it had to be done not once but a number of times and with the man on top . So , to make a long story short , they found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some man who looked like he had good genes , and they paid him money to do it on top three or four times to the " feminine " one . That is , three or four times on different occasions , with the " masculine " one holding her legs up to counteract gravity . It did n't hurt the " feminine " one any more but it distressed her terribly  --  she was beginning to have bad dreams , suicidal impulses , psychosomatic ailments . But then  --  true Eureka ! She missed her period , rabbit test positive  --  the " feminine " Dragon was pregnant ! Joy ! Hosanna ! There , in her tummy , a little precious baby Dragon , growing and getting scales already ! A miracle ! But the bad dreams did n't go away , the suicidal impulses did n't stop , the psychosomaticailments got worse . Six weeks later the " feminine " Dragon had a nervous breakdown and , a week after that , an abortion . Moral : Dragons do n't want babies , they just think they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her that Verta Killington Rhabb is a tawny-haired , ferret-eyed , small-minded liar , I believe her story . I do n't think it is just an apocryphal self-hate tale , it has the ring of truth to me . I think it really happened . In fact , I think it happened to Verta herself , that she was the " masculine " Dragon and that little blonde girl she lived with some years ago was the " feminine " Dragon . No doubt the story is exaggerated here and there to make it even more filthy and appalling , but I think they really did have a misadventure or two with one or more sailors and then found some man who for a price was willing to impregnate her , and that she then had a nervous breakdown and an abortion . It 's a true story , a wormheart tale . And of course the filthy thing about it is not the degradation of Verta and her friend and these men , but the ending of it , the killing of the baby , that is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete and true Dragon after all , because I would have had it if it had been me . Better to bring a little Dragon with scales into the world than nothing at all . Besides , it would n't have been a Dragon , it would have been a human child . A hateful story , that 's what it is , and I do n't think Tolstoy would have considered it worth putting on paper . I 'm sorry I did , because now I am even more depressed and bewildered than before . Verta and her friends laugh in hysteria at that tale , utter wild hysteria , but I do n't laugh at it , it makes me want to cry . Is Jim right to disbelieve in the Dragon ? Well , it 's true I seldom move in Dragon circles , I almost never seep235them , I am not a part of that world . They do n't distress me , I understandtheir feelings , they do n't bother or upset me  --  they bore me to death , that 's all . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet in my observation most Dragons do n't like them either , really . I do n't know what to think and I do n't know what he thinks . All I know is that to judge by the episode of last night the Dragon lives . It is late at night and I suppose Melody wants the lantern off so she can sleep . She looks up from her pillow and smiles at me and says no , the light does not bother her , in answer to my question . Now she shuts her eyes and stretches her arms behind her head , her breasts naively bare . What an innocent she is . Another woman would be doubtful of such a person as me , but not Melody . She 's an exception to the rule that I do n't like women . I really love her and would never want to hurt her . Let her have him , I hope she is happy . She really is an innocent , almost unbelievably so , but I guess there are other women like her in the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a repeat of the episode if I can possibly help it , I have been in her bed , have held her half-naked body in my arms , and she has slept like a child with her head on my shoulder  --  and I am absolutely certain she did n't know , she did n't think , she did n't even dream there was anything even remotely Dragonish about it . That might sound slightly incredible , but it 's true . She started this **34;10447;TOOLONG thing several days ago , I guess in the hope he would see her through the blanket partitionand pay some attention to her . " Oh , " she said , in a voice loud enough for him to hear , " It 's so hot , Florence . I 'm going to sleep with my tops unbuttoned . It 'll be more comfortable . " Yes , more comfortable . She wanted him to think about it and I 'm sure he has . Her breasts are her best feature by far ; they are large and firm and perfectly shaped , a pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nipples set in baby-bunting pink . That 's a fairly Dragonish description , I suppose , but I do n't see how anyone could help but admire such beauty . And it 's so unexpected , you 'd never dream it from the clothes she wears . If I had breasts like hers , I 'd probably have six children by now . So how did I wind up in bed with her ? It was the result of a Dragonishimpulse that took me completely by surprise . I have not allowedmyself on this island even to think about Melody in such terms ; and luckily , although I love her and admire her beautifulp236breasts , I am not especially attracted to her . So how did it happen ? Well , I woke up very late last night , heart pounding and out of breath and perspiration on my face and in my eyes . It was another of those goddamn dreams . As I said , I love him in my dreams . This time , he was not only kissing me and lying naked in my arms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so  --  a very unrealistic dream , since it did n't hurt me at all but on the contrary was ecstatically pleasurable . I think I would have had an orgasm in another few seconds if I had n't awakened , and I wonder if that would constitute a loss of virginity , psychologically anyhow ? I 'm afraid not . Besides , he was n't actuallydoing it , he was just " about " to do it  --  the truth is I do n't know what the sensation is really like and my dreams have to become fuzzy or stop at that point . But at any rate the dream made me feel horribly sexy and restless , and suddenly an insane impulse came to me . Selfabusedoes n't help much but I was considering it when the idea popped into my mind that Melody was even more frustrated than I was and since she was asleep half naked on a mattress two feet away , why not go and get in bed with her ? What the hell , why not ? I could kiss her , hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a splendid idea ! Why , mutual masturbation was normal as apple pie , it was rampant in every girl 's boarding school in the country and just what we needed in Morgan 's Treasure Cave ! The insane impulse was so strong I was appalled . Terrified . Horrified , in fact . Such a thing could n't succeed  --  she would gasp , cry out , push me frantically away , call to Jim , he would get up , light the kerosenelantern , stare sternly at me : " Florence , now what do you think you 're doing ? We ca n't have this kind of thing on this island . Now , goddamn it . .. " And then I heard in the darkness : " Snnf ! Snnff ! " She was awake , crying , miserable . Golden opportunity ! In a trice off go my own pajamatops and I am sitting beside her , my hand on her arm . I whisper : " Melody ? " A doleful sigh from her , very , very doleful , chock-full of despair . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left arm across the sheet on her stomach . " Why are you crying ? Are you unhappy ? " " Oh , yes , yes , yes , " she whispered , and I listened for several seconds to choking , suppressed sobs . Then another whisper : " Bend over , I do n't want him to hear . " " Let me get under the sheet , " I said . " All right , " she said , " come in bed with me . " Up goes the sheet ,  |p237me  under it , then soft arms around me , wet tears on my shoulder . " Oh , Florence , I love him , what can I do ? I love him , I love him . . . . " " I know , " I said . " It 's hard for you . " " It 's impossible . I 've tried , but it 's impossible . I want him so much , I ca n't resist . I ca n't , Florence , I know I ca n't . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . " " Yes , but what about Charles ? What about my husband ? " " Well . . . is he a nice man , kind ? " " Oh , yes , very nice , very kind . " " Then maybe he 'll understand and forgive you . " " Oh , no . No no no . He could n't understand such a thing as this . Never . You do n't know him , he 'd never understand it .... " We discussed it to no avail at considerable length , even though she was so exhausted she was practically going to sleep in my arms . I 'm sure it did n't even vaguely occur to her I could have had any " unnatural " feelings toward her , and oddly enough , at this point I did n't . It 's impossible to have a person weep in despair on your shoulder and not be affected . I felt nothing but pity for her . The Dragon was shriveled . Finally , in a sleepy whisper she said : " You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as weak and wicked as I am . You must have been very unhappy sometime yourself to be so understanding . I just ca n't help it , Florence , I love him and I ca n't think about anything else . What am I going to do ? It 's terrible , awful . I ca n't think about anythingbut him . " " Well , " I said , " go on to bed with him , then . " " Oh , no , " she answered . " I ca n't . . . my husband . . . I . . . I ca n't . " " Then control yourself , " I said sweetly . " Take walks , think about other things . " " I know , I know , " she whispered . " I 've tried that , but it does n't work . All I can think about is him . " Melody sighed in heavy gloom , and so did I. There really was no solution for her problem , none she herself could make or find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " Why do n't you go on to sleep ? Are n't you tired ? " " I 've never been so tired . I 'm tired all the time . But I ca n't sleep . Will you stay here with me for a while ? Do you mind ? I think I could sleep if you 'd stay a little while . "  |p238I  did n't mind . She went to sleep in my arms in about two minutes , emotionally and physically exhausted . First light , steady breathing , then heavy , then soft , slow breathing and complete relaxation , her hand limp and floppy as I lifted it from around my side . I put my hand on her breast and felt the thump of her heart . There was no reaction from her at all , she was sound asleep as a child . I had no temptation to do more and pulled up the sheet and put her limp arm back around me and my own arms around her . What difference would it make if she was asleep ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and worry and upset her . Besides , the Dragon 's fire had been extinguished . I felt nothing but pity and love for her ... well , nearly , but not quite . Coiled and skulking in some hidden hole , faint wisps of smoke came from the Dragon 's nostrils . I was aware of her beautiful breasts against me , of her soft breath on my neck , of her hair against my cheek and her tears drying on my shoulder . . . I myself slept so soundly I did n't awake until quite late and to judge from his manner at breakfast I think he saw us in bed together . I have felt badly about it all day . Nothing like this must happen again . It 's true the whole thing turned out to be " innocent " enough , but I think Melody , without being at all conscious of it , did respond to me and I think if I had made some kind of approach to her she would have responded more , and consciously . I do n't want that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would she , too , really . The worries I have had on this account have made this a bad day in my unhappy life and have led directly to the writing of these wretched pages . So much for my ill-advised and misbegotten effort to practice selftherapyby starting a " diary " on this island . A final , dismal thought . What will I do when they become lovers ? It 's bound to happen soon ; if I know him at all , he ca n't possibly continue to be so cruel to her . And believe it or not , dear Diary , I want it to happen , I truly do , I want her to have him and I want him to have her ; I am not really jealous , I love them both . But here , in this cave ? What is to become of me ? No . I ca n't stand that , not even if they make love in the afternoons when I 'm not here . I 'll move out , I 'll go sleep in a pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realistically speaking , " love in the afternoon " is the only practical answer . Thank God for Rufus and the island , thank God for the purple rocks , the waves , and the sun . I can always gop239there with my dog . Rufus will save me , there is a soul in him , a spirit . He looks at me with his beautiful brown eyes and he loves me , he does not know I am ugly and a Dragon lives in mc . Self-pity is too much , it is time to blow out the lantern and go to bed . Nature will solve my problem in another few years . A truly final thought : I wonder what my kindly and ultracivilized editor in New York  --  the original Rufus  --  would think if he could read these words ? Poor Rufus would collapse . The bad prose would not shock him , he has known me to write badly before , but the content . . . I shudder to think of it and must make a visit to the purple rocks and commit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would be a disaster if Melody should see and read this , and an intolerabledisaster if Jim should see and read it . To bed , sleepyhead , but still I wonder . . . I wonder . . . why did he ask that wholly unnecessary question on the plane to Atlanta ? He had seen me stare at the pretty stewardess and knew of my Dragon nature  --  why did he look at me with pain and sympathy and an amusement that was not cruel and ask that seemingly crude question ? And why did he take my hand beneath magnolias and live oaks and look in my eyes and say , " I 'm sorry , please forgive me . It 's a beautiful little park . " ? Ho ho ho , said Santa Claus . Get a grip on yourself , kid . The reindeersare in rut this time of year and do n't want to haul sleighs through the sky . To hell with him , he 's a vain and hateful bully , worse than buddy boy and Father dear combined . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breasts and gentle blue eyes , I would still shudder at the touch of his hand . He has aroused senseless hope in a hopeless person and nothing is more cruel . That is the truth , and I hate him and fear him . Dreams , dreams , dreams . . . I will throw these pages early in the morning to the pigs and iguanasas they splash in the rocky pools of Hell 's Half Acre.  |p240Dear  Charles : I am afraid the time has come for me to write you a letter that will cause us both heartache . This morning my companions here on the island went with me to a lovely meadow we call the Elysian Field for a simple Sunday service . I read the gist Psalm , which as you know contains the beautiful passage : " There shall no evil befall thee , neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling . For he shall give his angels charge over thee , to keep thee in all thy ways . " As I read those words in the midst of a beauty equaling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but of man 's own heart and soul , I found the courage to write you this letter , in the faith that in God 's love no evil can befall us and no plague come to our home , in the belief God 's promise is eternal and absolute and he shall forever and always give his angels charge over thee and me . There are hurtful and terrible things I must write to you , but first I want to tell you where I am and what has happened to us all . I have tried without much success on several occasions to write you before . I have been too exhausted to write coherently and too full of fear and confusion to write honestly , thus have torn up my earlier unfinished efforts . As I write you this I am still so tired I can hardly sit up and so worried about your illness and the concern you must feel for me I can hardly write at all . Let me hasten to say I am safe and hope to mail this letter to you in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will have been rescued from the little island upon which we are stranded . I 'm thankful the radiogram said your illness was not critical or I would truly be out of my mind with anxiety . But I ca n't understand why it was necessary to fly you back from Bogota to the United States . It must be something serious or they would n't do that . I wish they 'd told me more in the radiogram . All I can do is pray that you are all right and hope by the time you receive this you will be well.  |p241As  for myself , I am by God 's mercy safe . The ship was wrecked in the hurricane but the lives of three of us were spared  --  a man , another woman , and myself . The man 's name is Jim Kittering and the woman 's name is Florence Carr ; she is a well-known author and he has an important job in television . They are both wonderful friends to me and it is " Providential " I am with them . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called Providence , or at least I myself think so . Jim believes it is too small and Florence is undecided . But it is " Providence Island " to Inc , whatever its name . I feel that way about it because of the people I am here with . Jim Kittering is a very kind man and he has been a true and wonderful friend to me . He has also been very kind to Florence . He is married and has two children , young girls . The work he does puts him under great pressure and he and his wife have had some troubles and recently were separated , but I have no doubt they will get back together , he loves both her and the children very much . Florence also is a fine person and a true friend . It is " Providence Island " for me to be here with them . Florence and I are especially fortunate that Jim is with us on the island . I do n't know how we would have survived without him . He has made us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog ( she calls it Rufus , it was left on the ship along with a cat and a parrot ) and Jim has done many other things for us as well . It is lucky for Florence and me he is the kind of man he is ; I am sure you will realize it could be very serious for two women alone on an uninhabited island with a wicked man . Jim does not belong to any church but he is a good man and I am absolutely sure he will not harm either of us in any way , but on the contrary will look after us as if we were his sisters . I want to write you about the island and the wreck and everything that has happened , but I am very tired . We have been working constantly to fix up this cave so we can live in it for as long as need be . Jim insisted on it , that we be able to survive in case rescue is delayed . He has exhausted himself hauling food and supplies from the wreck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ribs when a huge wave struck the ship during the storm , and later when the ship hit the reef I myself was thrown down and badly bruised  --  it 's nothing serious , except for two weeks I could hardly sit down . Now , after three weeks here , I am glad to say we are both better and the hard work is done.  |p242I  do hope we will be rescued soon and I believe we will be . I 'm sure they have been looking for us and fishing boats must come here sometime , there are a lot of fish in the lagoon . I am not only anxious about your illness and concerned about your being worried about me , I am so eager to see you because there is much I want to tell you that I really can not put in a letter . I mean , I can not explain it in words , I could never explain it in words , but I believe because of this accident our life together will be very different in the future . I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so anxious to see you , Charles . Even as tired as I have been these last few days , I have thought of you again and again . I have thought of how fortunate I am to be married to such a kind and wonderful man , who is able so much more than I am to give of himself to others . I love you very much and do hope and pray to see you soon . Charles , I have learned something very important since I saw you last . The thing I have learned is that love means an understanding of one 's own weaknesses . It is not enough to understand other people 's failings , we must understand our own too . By forgiving ourselves , we can forgive others , and thus true love becomes possible . I believe this is very , very important . But do you think I mean we should " accept " our weaknesses ? I wish I were a writer like Florence and could express it in words  --  I say it but I ca n't make clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through . Of course we should never take license to be weak , this is the coward 's way out . " I ca n't help it , I am weak . " No , I do n't mean this . Do you know at all what I am trying to say ? It 's by seeing our own human side that we can see the human side of others and can love and understand them . Because , Charles , no matter how hard we try , no matter even with resolutions and prayer , is n't it true we are all human beings , the " children of God "  --  and do n't children by their very nature often stumble and fall ? And if a child stumbles , do we hate the child ? No , of course not , we run and help it , we show sympathy and take a little child in our arms when it cries . Would n't anyone do this ? And we are all children in so many ways , but when a grown person is hurt and cries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy between grown people that when we find it life becomes " like unto paradise " and an ordinary meadow with wildflowers a true Elysian Field . Instead of studying man , for whose happiness and worth and fulfillment the law is designed , wep243have studied the empty and meaningless law itself with cold hearts and cold minds , and thereby have turned the Elysian Field into a dismal and inhuman swamp . I know we have argued about all of this before , even as far back as schooldays . I have not forgotten the number of times you and other friends saved me from being expelled from Tom Armour for my hereticaland radical views . It still is a mystery to me how I ever graduatedfrom there . I suppose it is because I look innocent , but certainly I am not , I am a " radical , " as you say , perhaps even more than you realize . Perhaps more than I have dared let you realize . If it were up to me , whole reams of the Bible itself would be dismissed as superstitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , although I have told you before in less harsh terms the same thing . You have a way of not listening to me . If it 's a thing you do n't want to hear , you do n't hear it . I wonder if I can penetrate your deafness if I try . Some of the Bible contains great moral wisdom , some of it contains inspired and beautiful poetry , but most of it is junk , Charles . I have been reading it lately and thinking about it . I would say about five percent is worthwhile , and the rest is junk . Yes , I am trying to shock you . I ca n't believe you yourself are as naive as you pretend . How could you go through medical school and believe all the things you say you believe ? You do n't always act on the things you say you believe . Do you remember failing to report to the police the boy who visited us in Knoxville in a stolen car ? Do you remember helping the young student nurse obtain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your beliefs , and can you guess which of these I respect ? Do you know why I love and admire you and married you in the first place ? Oh , Charles , I ca n't tell you how I feel , I am making a ruin of this letter because I can not find the words to say what I want to say . I do wish I could get off this island ! I am tired all the time , I 've been so depressed here and have such terrible dreams . And I ca n't sleep or , if I do , a nightmare wakes me up . I finally went to sleep last night around two o'clock and woke up an hour later with an awful dream . It was horrible , dreadful . There 's this place Florence likes , a cliff about fifty feet high with jagged rocks down below . Big lizards are there and Florence says wild pigs sometimes come too . She calls it " Hell 's Half Acre " and that 's what it really looks like.  |p244The  dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can remember . I was there on the cliff and the light was strange and suddenly the rock began to move and I could n't stay on my feet . I tried , but twice I fell down and when I did , the lizards ( they were all over everywhere ) rushed up at me and tried to bite me on the legs and push me over the cliff . I got very angry and threw rocks at them . Then I think I killed some animal , not a lizard but some worse animal , I believe a kind of half hog and half man . There was blood all over everywhere and the animal was screaming , it was dying , screaming and dying . I felt awful , but it had tried to kill me , tried to push me over the cliff with its nose  --  it was pushing at me and making a horrible slobbering noise and also trying its best to bite me , and I did n't know what to do so I threw a big rock at it and killed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slide off the cliff and be killed myself when Jim came running and jumped down and grabbed my hand and pulled me back just in time . I was crying , hysterical . He put his arm around my shoulder and the ground stopped shaking and he led me away , but I could still hear the animal screamingas it died . That was the worst part , killing that animal and hearing it scream . I can still hear it screaming , even now . The dream might not sound so terrible , but it frightened me worse than anything since I was a child . I woke up crying and could n't go back to sleep even though I was so tired I was nearly crazy . I do n't think I have ever been so miserable and frightened . Luckily , Florence woke up and heard me crying and came and got in bed with me or I think I would have died . I really think I would have died , at least I felt that way . Florence acts kind of gruff , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I will always love her . She held me in her arms so tender I can never forget it . And the next day I realized how hard it must have been for her to think of me , because she has troubles and worries of her own . She did n't think of herself , she cried with sympathy for me , and held me in her arms in the most beautiful way and I will always love her for it . The truth , I am afraid , is that Florence has a bad problem on the island here . You see , she is not very pretty and I do n't think many men have been interested in her , but Jim has been kind and sweet to her , he has shown that he likes her and admires her and cares about her , and I 'm afraid she has fallen completely in love with him . Ip245did n't quite realize it until this morning when I saw the way she was looking at him , then watched the way she was laughing at something he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little about it and I think hurt her feelings . She denied it in a pathetic way that convinced me she loves him even more than I 'd realized . Of course , he 's married and it 's hopeless . Florence herself has never married and I do n't think she has had much experience with men at all , which makes it all the harder for her . To fall in love at last and for it to be a married man must be awful for her . She is a typical spinster , wears suits , has canaries in her apartment , leads a very lonely life . I do n't think Jim loves her , but he likes her very much and although I say it 's " hopeless " I almost feel .. . Well , you would n't understand what I was going to say , so I wo n't say it . There 's no point in my writing something to you that you simplywould not ever understand . But I do n't know , I ca n't go on the way things are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles . We have got to get our marriage on a different basis , so I will say what I was thinking about Florence . Yes , I will say it even if you do n't understand it . My thought was that if we are here on the island for a long time more , then I almost feel it would be a good thing if Jim lives with Florence here , and not as brother and sister but as man and woman . In fact , I do n't almost think that , I do think that . Maybe it would be adultery because of his wife , maybe I am wrong ; I know you will think so , that my idea is pagan , barbarous , sinful , wicked . The reason I feel as I do is because of Florence . But first Jim . He has been unfaithful to his wife before , he told me so . And she has been unfaithful to him too . That is the real reason they are separated . Such things happen in the world , Charles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes it is a good idea not to act perfectly , , because what seems perfect is n't perfect at all but horrible . It wo n't hurt Jim or his wife for him to live with Florence on this island . Not a bit . You ca n't convince me it would hurt them , because I know it would n't . And it would help Florence . Like most spinsters , she is very afraid of men . For example , even though she loves Jim , she hides it from . him as much as she can and from me too , for fear I might tell him or reveal it to him . She is terrified of men . Also , she has an awful complexabout being ugly . The truth is she is not as ugly as she thinks she . is . I wish I had her figure  --  without her clothes , she is slender andp246pretty as a girl . There 's nothing wrong with her looks and some man would be very grateful and happy to have her love , all the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talented writer , a person of real character who has achieved something and can achieve more . It would be the best thing in the world for Florence to have an " affair " with Jim on this island . Because this would give her confidence , it would get her over her fears , make a complete woman of her not only physically but emotionally and spiritually . She would learn to give love to a man , to relax and not be afraid with a man . She would learn that a man can be attracted to her and want her and make love to her , that she is not a leper or something but a desirable woman . It would change her life forever . She would go back to New York and find a husband of her own and have a child and be fulfilled and happy instead of lonely and miserable in that apartment with her chirping canaries . You call it adultery , and I call it salvation ! And if you do n't like it , then I do n't care , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Florence and not some rigid rule that does n't serve the purpose of either God or man  --  I want to help Florence and you want to smother her and let her die . Yes , that 's what you want , Charles , it 's exactly what you want , you and all the people who think the way you do . You talk of Christian love , but it is n't love of any kind , it 's narrow fear and mean-hearted hate that goes against everything that makes life beautiful and worth living . The prophet meant not an empty love of God , but a true love of God , a love of God 's children and a love of life itself  --  then , and only then , " He shall give his angels charge over thee . " Otherwise , devils will rule you , as they rule you now , Charles , to my grief and woe during the last three wretched years of our marriage . You said to me I was " abnormal " just before you left for Bogota . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark has cost me . I thought perhaps it was true . I also thought there was something wrong with me , that I was so unattractive no man could want me . How many times have I cried myself to sleep because of that thing you said ? It 's not true , it 's a cowardly lie . I am no different from other women . Every woman wants to love someone and to be loved . And I am not unattractive , a man can want me and love me too . Charles , it is unbearable to me to go back to things the way they were . Two days ago , when I went with Florence to that cliff , the thought came to me that maybe we would be rescued soon and Ip247would see you again , and I had an urge to throw myself down on those rocks and die . I ca n't stand it any more ! I ca n't , I ca n't endure it ! How could you say such a thing about a person you love ? How ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . I have read this letter through carefully and to say I am so tired I do n't know what I am writing is no excuse . The design is plain , the intention obvious . The whole point is to justify my being unfaithful . Moral law is meaningless , therefore Florence should live with Jim . My husband does n't love me , therefore I should live with Jim too . I am exhausted and I am going to sleep and I hope a better vision of paradise on earth will come to me in my dreams . Oh , God , deliver me from this island ! The truth is , I am a weak and wicked woman with sin on my mind , ready and willing to use any excuse , any argument , any justification , even the 91st Psalm . " He shall give his angels charge over thee "  --  yes , me , a naked angel on one side of him and Florence , a naked angel on the other . That was my inspired vision when I read those words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do anything with the feathers ? I do n't know what you 're talking about , Florence . I do n't understand you at all . What could I possibly do with the feathers ? " " You could make a nest out of them , I suppose . " " A nest ? " " Or a bed , maybe , " said Florence . " I should think bluebird featherswould make a lovely bed . " Melody picked up her fork . " All right , Florence , " she said . " It happens to have been just a dream , that 's all . I 've dreamed about bluebirdsmany times before . I even dreamed about them as a child . " " You 're ahead of me , " said Florence . " I do n't dream about bluebirds , I dream about less elegant creatures . " " I do n't care what you dream about ; it does n't interest me . " " Sorry , " said Florence . " I was just making light conversation . Actually , it 's a lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit her lips together and did not speak again until after Florence had left for her morning walk . She then turned to Jim and said : " I want to talk to you about something important . " " Yes , I think we should talk , " he answered . " It 's very important , Jim . Very , very important . I thought this morning would be a good time , while Florence is off on her walk with Rufus . " " I think it 's an excellent time , " said Jim . He could not quite controla slight tremor in his voice . The bluebirds , he was sure , would arrive on Providence Island very soon . In fact , a few feathers already had fallen . " She ca n't mind her own business , you know , " said Melody . " Of course , the way we 're living here , I know it 's hard for her . But I get tired of those little remarks . Do you suppose she was eavesdropping last night ? " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that . " " No , I do n't think she would either . But she might have heard us without intending to . Jim , it took me till all hours to go to sleep last night . I do n't know when I finally did , it must have been almost morning . " " I had a little trouble dropping off myself , " said Jim . " I ca n't stand another night like that . You may not believe it , but I almost got up , a dozen times I almost did . To tell the truth , around four o'clock I did get up . I could n't control myself , it was as if itp253was n't me doing it but somebody else . I got up in the dark and stood there by the blanket partition for about five minutes with my knees shaking and I still do n't know how I ever got back to my bed . Jim , I ca n't go on like this and that 's why I want to talk to you . " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm afraid neither of us has been very realistic . " " I certainly have n't been , " said Melody . " I 'm just not used to being honest about such things . I 've never been honest about it before in my life , but I 've got to be now . " Jim had felt it coming . On the evening before , after a gloomy afternoonspent writing and tearing up still another letter to her husband , Melody had entertained Florence and him for a couple of hours by playing the ebonite and mother-of-pearl accordion he had found in a crewman 's cabin on the wreck . She had a natural musical bent and had learned during her childhood to play both the piano and the accordion by ear . Pleased by Jim 's and Florence 's praise , she played first one thing and then another with a childlike enjoyment , first hymns and semisacred country music and then , to Jim 's surprise , a number of songs from Broadway musicals and other popular tunes he would not have expected her to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and laughed , and the look of chronic , nagging melancholyleft her eyes . It was the first time Jim had seen her happy since before the hurricane . Later in the evening , after Florence had gone to bed , Melody stood with him in the entrance of the cave and stared at the sprinkled , diamondlike stars of the tropical sky , arms locked across her breasts and a wistful expression on her face in the dim light . " It was fun , " she said , " more fun than anything since we 've been on the island . I 'm tired of being miserable , Jim . I 'm so tired of being miserable I do n't think I can stand it any more . " Jim put his arm around her waist and Melody leaned toward him , a hand on his shoulder and the fresh scent of soap and salt water in her hair . " Jim , will we ever get off this island ? " " I do n't know . " Jim tightened his forearm in the curve of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madness ! Not madness what he was doing , but madness he had not done it before . This , on the island , an overwhelmingly attractive woman who belonged by all the logic of life itself in his arms , and he had stayed away from her and she from him ? Such insanity was caused by excessive reflection onp254morals . Only the wicked reflect on morals . Sheer madness ! What more truly moral thing could he do than put his arm around her curving waist and gently but firmly spread his fingers on her soft , womanly , human stomach ? " I do n't know if or when we 'll be rescued , honey , " said Jim . " I suppose we will sometime . " " I think we will soon , " replied Melody in a surprisingly calm voice that continued serenely without pause as Jim 's hand moved down between her thighs , " but I do n't know what good it will do . My husbandeither ca n't or does n't love me . We 've hardly lived together at all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way it seems to me . He says I 'm abnormal and maybe he 's right . Jim , you 'd better not do that . " " Had n't I ? " " No . No , you 'd better not . " " Why should n't I ? " " Oh , I do n't know . I do n't know anything , maybe Charles is right . " Melody 's voice was becoming less calm . She turned toward Jim and put her hands on his shoulders . " All I know is I 've tried , but I ca n't help it . And it is n't just that I love you . I 'm a woman and I want to live . That 's what I really want , Jim , I want to live . " Jim put both arms around her and pulled her toward him . " Sounds reasonable . " " Yes , but it is n't , " said Melody in a tiny voice . " You 'd better not kiss me . " " I think I had better , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , I do n't think you should . " " Why not ? " " Well , you had better not . " During this exchange of semimindless words , Jim tried to find her lips but only succeeded in kissing her cheek , her neck , and her hair . Melody rested her hands on his shoulders and made no attempt to pull away from him , but she would not kiss him . " Melody , hold your head still , you can kiss me . " " No , I ca n't . If I do , I 'll sleep with you . " " Do n't worry about that . " " I have to worry about it . " " No , you do n't . " " Jim , please , let me go . " Jim took her chin in his hand and said , " Just kiss me once . "  | " It wo n't be once , " she answered , " you know that . " As he found her lips after three weeks and three days and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's body press against him , any small moral doubts Jim Kittering might have had were obliteratedby love and desire . As he continued to kiss her with a geometricallyprogressive passion , he forgot all of his argument on behalf of chaste Christian love . The battle was over , finished , done with , and for her as well as for him . The violence of her response made that perfectly plain . However , although she kissed him repeatedly in the most passionate manner imaginable and did not prevent him from pulling her dress over her shoulders and taking off her brassiere , Melody would not go to his bed and she would not go to the beach either . Bosom bare , breathless , hands and knees trembling , she shook her head and would not budge . The most he could get out of her was a statement she " might " after Florence was asleep . " Look , you 're a grown woman , Melody , and I 'm a grown man . We 're not teen-agers in a parking lot . " " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I realize that . " " All right , then what do you mean , you might ? " " I mean , I might when I 'm sure Florence is asleep . It 's perfectly obvious what I mean , Jim . " " Will you or wo n't you , Melody ? " " Well . . . I have to think . " " Look , I ca n't lie there all night wondering . Will you come or not ? " " I do n't know , I might . " " Melody , that 's no answer . Are you worried about Florence ? " " Of course I 'm worried about Florence . She 's right there . " " All right , then let 's go to the beach . " " Oh , no , I ca n't do that . " " Why ca n't you ? " " Because something will happen . " " Oh , for God 's sake , you said you might come to my bed , did n't you ? " " Yes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would n't it ? " " Ah-h-h . . . yes , I think it probably would . Very likely . " " Melody , if you got in bed with me , it 'd be a dead certainty we'dmake love  --  is n't that true ? "  | " Yes . " " All right , if you 're worried about Florence , then why ca n't you go to the beach ? " " Because it 's impossible , Jim , that 's why . I ca n't , like that , I just ca n't . " " I see . You ca n't , like that . But you might ' come to my bed later tonight if you 're sure Florence is asleep . " " Yes , I do n't promise , but I might . Please let me go on to bed now. , , Jim had been sure she would n't come and was glad she did n't . A mere seduction of her seemed to him wrong , inappropriate , vulgar . This was not the way he felt about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for her , he went to sleep relieved that she did not come . The proper thing was not to kiss her and take off her brassiere and seduce her like a teen-ager , but rather a rational , deliberate , sensible decision to live together as man and woman on the island . Well , she had wanted to think about it and undoubtedly had done so , and then she had dreamed about bluebirds . Thus , on the following morning , the picture seemed quite clear to Jim Kittering . A great cloud of bluebirds was on the horizon and the feathers of advance scouts already were floating in the air . " Honey , " he said , " the time has come for us both to be honest . Do you want to talk here ? " " No , let 's go somewhere else . " " All right , we 'll go to the cove then . " When they reached the thin strip of beach by the cove , Jim put his hands on his hips and stared across the emerald water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The morning sun turned the rusting wreck a soft red . " Still there , " said Jim . " I do n't think it 'll ever slide off that reef . The damn thing 'll be there a hundred years from now . " " I 'm glad it did n't slide off while you were on it , " answered Melody . " Florence and I used to worry about that a lot . Especially Florence , she 's the anxious type underneath . Once , when the wind was blowing and you were out there , I thought she 'd have a fit . She would n't watch . She became almost hysterical and began to cry . " Jim dropped his hands from his hips in surprise . " Florence became almost hysterical ? " he asked . " Because of me ? Are you kidding ? " " No , I 'm not . She said , He 's going to drown , ' then began to cry and ran in the cave and stayed there till you came back . "  | " Florence did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't cry about me . " " She would and she did . She cried this morning , did n't you see her ? " " I sure did n't , and you 're crazy . " " No , I 'm not crazy . I almost wish I were , but I 'm not . " " All right , why did Florence cry this morning , and when ? " " She cried because I dreamed about bluebirds and she thinks we 're going to be lovers . She made those little remarks and I snapped at her , then when I looked over at her she had tears in her eyes . She 's jealous of me . " " You 're out of your mind , " said Jim . " Florence is n't jealous of you  --  and we have n't come out here to talk about her . " " As a matter of fact , Florence is one of the things I do want to talk to you about . " " Huh , " said Jim , who was disconcerted by this tack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bringing up Florencein such a way ? " Florence or no Florence , this sun 's pretty bright . Let 's go sit under the Hanging Tree , we can talk there . " Melody had become more and more nervous as they approached the beach . She now stared apprehensively at the big tree at the foot of the cliff . " All right . But I wish you would n't call it the Hanging Tree . " " I did n't give it that name , your friend Florence did . ' What would you rather I call it , honey ? " " I do n't care , anything you like , but not the Hanging Tree . Why do we need a Hanging Tree on this island ? Why does anyone need a Hanging Tree anywhere ? " " Well , you 've got to hang people someplace , " said Jim . " But never mind , we wo n't go into it  --  let 's sit under the Tree of Life and talk . " Melody 's eyes were frightened behind the more modem-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel-rimmed spectacles . These were glasses she did not wear as a rule because Charles considered them " too Hollywoody . " " All right , " said Melody , " we 'll talk . But . . . do you want to take a swim first ? " " A swim ? " " Well , yes . " Jim had a sudden mental picture of Melody frolicking and splashing in flimsy underwear in warm emerald water . Was such swift spiritualp258development possible ? Although she bathed at least once and often twice a day in a small salt-water pool dubbed by Florence " Melody 's Bathtub , " she had not been swimming for the sake of pleasure a single time since they had arrived on the island . She " had no bathing suit " and was too modest to swim in her underwear , and too modest even to borrow Florence 's bathing suit , which she said was too small for her . The fact that both Jim and Florence had seen her stark naked for quite a while during the hurricane was a thing she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . both of us , go swimming right now ? " " Oh , no , no , no , not me , " said Melody , " you  --  I do n't have a suit . " Jim had been fighting off a headache ever since he awakened and a faint stab of pain came between his eyes as the vision of Melody in her wet underwear vanished . This interview was not going quite as expected . " I do n't want to go swimming all by myself , " he said . " Besides , I thought you wanted to talk to me . " " I do . But I thought you might like to swim first . " " No , let 's talk . " In a weak voice , Melody said : " All right . " Jim took her hand to help her up the little knoll at the foot of the cliff . The Hanging Tree or Tree of Life , whatever its proper name , grew in a scalloped and overhung recess of the cliff face and formed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slope , " said Melody . Resistance , thought Jim . " No , it 's not comfortable , " he answered . " We 'll sit under the tree where it 's level . " " This is comfortable . " " It 's right in the sun , Melody . Let 's sit under the tree in the shade . Come on . " The Hanging Tree had leaves different from those of any other tree on the island and in Jim 's belief was not native to Providence but had been planted by some visitor long , long ago . What visitor ? he wondered , as he pulled Melody up the knoll and sat down with her in deep shade beneath the spreading canopy of olive-green foliage . Sir Henry Morgan himself , maybe ? Was Morgan 's Treasure buried , perhaps , beneath this tree ? The talk with Melody thus far had been rather peculiar  --  first that cryptic notion about Florence , then the senseless suggestion he go swimming alone , and finally the resistance on the slope . However , Melody had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p259And  she was thinking now , head bowed over her hands in her lap as she sat on the sand beneath the hanging boughs . " Well , " said Jim , " what did you want to talk to me about , honey ? " Melody adjusted her pale gray dress over her knees , lifted her eyes , and said in a calm voice : " Jim , I do n't think we 're going to get off this island any time soon . We 've been here over three weeks now and we have n't seen anything at all like a boat . I think we might be here for a long time , maybe for months , perhaps many months . It could even be a year or two . " " I 've said that from the beginning , honey . The island is in a remote area , it 's very tiny , it has no harbor . The reef is too dangerous for fishing boats and too dangerous for pleasure yachts . We could be here a long time . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to need your help . That 's why I 've asked you to come talk with me this morning . Jim , I ca n't do it by myself . " " Ca n't do what , honey ? " " I ca n't resist unless you help me . Not for a long time , not for months . I could hardly do it even these few weeks , and last night I did n't have any will left at all . I have n't been honest about my feelings , but I 'm being honest now . Jim , I ca n't control myself all alone , you 've got to help me . " Jim reached in reflex to his shirt pocket and felt a little pang ; it was at moments like this he wanted a cigarette . " Help you ? I 'm not sure I exactly understand . " She had been calm at the beginning , but an extreme nervous tension now seized Melody . She stared intently at him through the tortoiseshellglasses and twisted her fingers with a wringing motion in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as old-fashioned as you think I am , " she said . " I know you 're a man , and a man needs love . A woman 's love ... or most men do , anyhow . I realize that , I know it is n't fair to ask a man to . . . live alone for such a long period of time , or for what might be a long period . " " Women are no different , Melody . A woman needs love too . " " No , I do n't agree with that . I think women are n't the same . If a woman knows nothing is going to happen , she can adjust to it . But for a man I think it would be very difficult and that 's why I 'm suggesting Florence . " Jim stared emptily at her . " You 're suggesting Florence ? "  | " Yes . You could live with her here . I 'm sure she would be willing , she loves you . " Again Jim reached to his shirt pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbed at his jaw in consternation . It was a developmenthe had not anticipated . " Well , now , " he said , " that would be difficult . That would pose a few problems . " " I know . Of course , it would still be adultery , you 're married . But you and your wife have been unfaithful before and you are separated . I do n't think it would be much more added danger to your marriage , although of course it would be to some extent . Any such thing is bound to be dangerous . You and Florence might fall in love seri-ously . " This madness had to stop . " Melody , " said Jim gently , " I 'm afraid you 're barking up the wrong stump . Florence does n't love me , she 's a Lesbian . " " She 's . . . what ? She 's a what ? " " She 's a Lesbian . She is n't attracted to men , she 's attracted to her own sex . It 's you Florence loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Melody . " That 's the most ridiculous idea I ever heard of . Florence is no such thing . " " Honey , I 'm sorry to tell you this and I do n't mean to upset you , but there are women like that in the world . They ca n't help it , they 're not to be condemned or blamed for it  --  " " I know there are women  --  " " Just a minute , please , let me finish . I was saying , there are such women . As a result of painful early experiences they ca n't  --  " " I know there are such women , but Florence is n't one of them ! " " I 'm afraid she is . " " Jim , she is n't ! Do n't you think I would know ? She 's not like that at all . How could you believe such a stupid thing ? " " Well , " said Jim with an uncomfortable smile , " her clothes , for example . Mannish suits , Melody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unattractive and inferior . She 's afraid to compete , that 's all . " " That is n't all . I caught her staring at a pretty stewardess on the plane going to Atlanta . " " So what ? I often stare at pretty girls . " " Not the way she did . " " Listen , you 're wrong . I know you 're wrong and I think you know it too . You do n't believe this about Florence . "  |p261Jim  started to answer angrily , then paused for a moment to think . It was true he 'd always had certain doubts about Florence 's Lesbianism . Perhaps Melody was partly correct . But only partly . " I 'm afraid you do n't know what you 're talking about , " he said . " Florence forms emotional relationships with women , not with men . " " What spinster does n't , if men do n't want them ? What else has Florence got but girl and women friends ? This is silly , I do n't even want to talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she loves you , and one of those women would n't . " A half-wincing squint came on Jim 's face as he stared out at the emerald water of the lagoon beyond the umbrella-like limbs of the tree . Melody 's absolute conviction was strangely persuasive , and if she was right , the situation on the island was not at all as he had thought . " Tell me something , " he said . " How did it happen Florence got in bed with you the other night ? " " I asked her to . I 'd had a nightmare , I was crying and miserable . " " What happened when she got in bed with you ? " " Nothing happened . She was very , very sweet to me , that 's all . Jim , you could n't be more wrong . Florence is just as feminine as I am , in some ways more so . " Jim 's vexed irritation slowly disappeared as he stared out at the luminouswater of the lagoon . It was true Florence in some ways was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not go very deep . In fact , it was ninety-five-percent bluff and so in all likelihood was the Lesbianism . Well , he 'd always been dubious of Florence 's Lesbianism . The mannish suit seemed like a disguise somehow . He 'd doubted it on the plane too . She had not looked at the pretty stewardessexactly as a man would , but with a kind of rueful sadness . " You 're right , " said Jim . " I guess I just did n't want to take it on . But you 're wrong in thinking she loves me . " " I 'm sure she does . And I 'm sure she 'd be willing to live with you here on the island . Of course , she 's very afraid of men and very afraid of you too . You 'd have to be . . . tactful with her  --  you know , gentle and understanding and yet firm . It would be difficult , she 's very afraid , but I 'm sure you could get her if you were persistent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much and  --  " " Now look ! Just a minute . Calm down . Maybe Florence is n't an out-and-out Lesbian , but I do n't love her . " " Yes , but you like her very much . " " Melody , I do n't want Florence , I want you ! "  | " Yes , but that would be immoral . With Florence , I do n't think it would be . Not really . Or at least , not much . " Jim 's headache was not getting any better . The very idea of giving up Melody for Florence gave him a shooting pain between the eyes . " Not much ! " he exclaimed . " Melody , what a screwball you are ! And what a notion for a missionary 's wife to have . Will you tell me the difference between my committing adultery ' with Florence and my committing adultery ' with you ? " " Yes , I will , " she answered . " First , Florence . I know it 's adultery , technically and even literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be dangerous to your marriage . As for Florence , of course it would n't be permanent , but I believe it would help her , give her confidence , make her act more normal toward men . It would also help her here on the island , she 'd be happy while it lasted , anyhow . Of course she might get pregnant and that 's a problem . But she told me once how much she loves children and how she 's often dreamed of adopting a child . I think she 'd be happy to have a baby even if she were n't married . In fact , I 'm sure of it . And nobody in New York would blame her , on this island and everything . It would be the best thing that could happen to Florence , much the best thing , and to me it is n't adultery , not really . And I think you should live with her . " " I think you 're out of your head , " said Jim . " That 's the craziest speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " She 's not all that old and set in her ways , and she does love children . Even more important , she loves you . " " She does n't love me and I 'm getting tired of you saying that . " " I happen to know she does . " " I 'm sorry , but you happen to be wrong . And you 're wrong in thinking Florence is capable of a love affair with a man . She might not be an actual Lesbian , but she 's extremely neurotic toward men . She shudders in revulsion if I touch her even accidentally . God knows what she 'd do if I went to her and said , Florence , I want to live with you . ' She 'd probably scream and jump in the ocean and start swimmingtoward Central America . " " I do n't think so . She 'd be afraid , but she would n't jump in the ocean . Even if she argued and carried on and resisted , deep inside she 'd be overjoyed . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Florence loves you , Jim . " Wearily , Jim put the palms of his hands over his eyes and his fingersin the roots of his hair . How had they become bogged down inp263this mad conversation about Florence ? " Melody , " he said , " arguing with you is like arguing with this goddamn tree . You get an idea in your head and you wo n't give it up . Now listen . Florence might  --  I say , she might  --  have a kind of romantic fixation on me . I 'm aware of this , I 've watched her , I 've seen how she acts . But believe me , she 'd get over it damned quick if I even looked at her seriously . " " A romantic fixation ? " asked Melody . " Is that what you think it is ? " " I would n't even put it that strongly , " said Jim as he tried to think of some way to get the conversation off Florence . " I guess you really do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know she is n't very pretty . And I suppose that 's all most men want , they do n't care what a woman 's like inside . They just want pretti-ness . " " Melody , will you listen ? Florence is a daydreamer , all writers are . " " Well , she 's just a suggestion , " said Melody in a remote tone . " It 's none of my business , it 's completely up to you and her . If you feel it 's wrong or if she does , then I certainly would n't disagree with you . " Jim paused , badly discouraged by the conversation thus far . The great cloud of bluebirds seemed to have turned around and headed back toward Texas . " Look , honey , " said Jim gently , " I 'm sure you meant well by your suggestion , and actually it 's a kind of remarkable thing for you to say . But I love and want you . " Melody 's eyes softened as a little smile came on her face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " How is it different ? " " It would n't mean the same thing to me and Charles that it would to you and Linda . If I have a love affair with you on this island , it will be the end of everything for me and my husband . " " I do n't think that 's necessarily true at all . " " I think it is . I might be wrong , but it 's a chance I ca n't take . You will have to admit , an adulterous affair often leads to divorce . " Jim hesitated . It always startled him when Melody started talking rationally . " Yes , " he said , " an affair can lead to divorce , sure . Going down to the corner for a pack of cigarettes can lead to divorce . " " An affair is more dangerous , would n't you say ? " " Yes , I suppose so . " " It could lead to more than divorce . Jim , if you and I live together on this island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . " " We 're already involved , honey . "  | " If I live with you here , I think we would become so involved we might want to get married . Maybe not , but even so , we have to considerthe chance . Jim , even if you did n't have a wife you love and I did n't have a husband I love , you and I would not be suited . I could n't fit in your life . I do n't have the same interests you have and I would n't know what to say to your friends or the people with whom you work . And you would n't fit in my life . The fact that we love each other does n't mean we could be man and wife and fulfilled together , even if we were free , and we 're not . Now , will you tell me if you agree with me ? " " Well , " said Jim , " maybe I do . But I think you 're being a little cold-blooded about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are leaving out my feelings and yours . " " No , I 'm not . I said we love each other . But it 's one thing on the boat or here on the island , away from everything and everybody . It would be another thing back in the world . I 'm a trained nurse and have a religious calling . " Jim Kittering smiled . A grogginess had come upon him . " Well , I know you 're an idealist , " he said . " No , Charles is an idealist , not me , " said Melody . " I 've never been an idealist , I do n't believe in ideals , I believe in feelings . So does Charles , deep inside . In my opinion , all people who really do anything believe in feelings . " Anything , thought Jim , to get the subject off Charles . This was worse than the discussion about Florence . " Intelligence plays its part , Melody . You did n't graduate as a nurse because of your sympathy for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course you 've got to use judgment . That 's what we 've got to do now , you and me . I studied to be a nurse because this is my life and my work . You have your life and your work , Jim , and although I think in your way you want to help people too , the means by which you do it are very different from mine . We could n't have a common life together and if we forgot our responsibilities and tried it we would fail , and the result would be heartache for all concerned . I do n't want that , I do n't want to risk it . We might not have the strength to give each other up when we leave the island and we are not suited to each other . That is the point I 'm making and this time I want a real answer from you . Do you agree with me or not ? "  |p265Badly  depressed , Jim gazed out at the white-topped waves along the curving line of the reef . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . He could not see himself organizing a Sundayschoolpicnic and singing hymns in church and he could not see Melodymaking conversation with a Gibson on the rocks in her hand at a New York cocktail party . Jim said , " I agree with you , honey . We would n't be suited as far as marriage is concerned , even if we were free . " A sadness came into Melody 's face . For a moment she bowed her head and stared down at the lap of her pale gray dress , then she looked up at Jim and said : " I guess I hoped you would n't agree with me . But it 's true , Jim . We really are n't suited to each other . " " In the outside world , maybe not , but we 're here on the island now . " " We wo n't be on the island forever . We have to go back and we ca n't forget that . Do n't you agree ? " " I do n't think we 'll be here forever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I are suited , Jim . He 's a good husband for me and I 'm a good wife for him . We have the same interests , the same work , the same friends . Of course we have some problems , every marriage does . But Charles and I are almost perfect for each other . " With an effort of will , Jim forced himself to nod gravely . He was determined to resist the temptation to remind her she had said the night before Charles could not or did not love her , that she and her husband had hardly lived together at all for the past three years . " This is looking at it from a practical point of view , but there 's another way to look at it more important than anything practical . I 'm talking about love in its deepest sense . I love my husband , Jim . Charles is a wonderful man , whatever his faults . His feeling for others is greater than that of anyone I 've ever known . He can see into people in ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he is now . The power he has is very rare and it 's my duty to help him fulfill himself . I owe him that just as he owes me the same . If love has any meaning at all , loyalty must go with it . I ca n't commit adultery with you on this island . It would destroy my husband and me too . If you love me , if you care about me , then please help me . " " Melody . . . I admire your loyalty and I respect it . The point is , we 're stranded on an uninhabited island and we might be here ap266long time . I do n't see how any sensible man could object if his wife lived with someone else under these conditions . " Spots of color came into Melody 's cheeks . In silence she stared at the pale gray dress over her knees , then looked up and said : " Jim , I would get pregnant . I 'd get pregnant right away , I know I would . Think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our trouble comes from his not being able to be a father . Jim , he would n't be able to stand it . " " Oh , Christ , " said Jim . " I 'll do whatever you want . " Jim felt her hand on his arm . " I 'll always be grateful . You do n't know what this means to me or what a difference it makes . Here , I have a Bible in my pocket . " " A Bible ? What for ? " " Jim , I know you 'll keep your word . But I want us both to put our hands on the Bible and swear . It will help us . " " Oh , come on now , Melody ! " " Please , I want us to . It 's important to me . I know we both already swore when we were married , but the island is like another world . I want us to swear in this situation here . " Jim looked at her in deepest gloom . " All right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to swear ? " " This . I solemnly swear I will not commit adultery with Melody on this island , so help me God . ' That 's what I want you to swear , then I will swear the same thing about you . " Jim put his hand on the Bible with a helpless little shrug . He felt like a swimmer treading water in the North Atlantic . It would be impossible to get out of such an oath . The thing was fatal , the water deep and cold and dark . What was he doing in the icy North Atlantic when a warm and beautiful emerald lagoon was only a few yards away ? And where had the great cloud of bluebirds gone ? Head bowed , Jim stared at the Bible and at the pale gray dress behind it , then looked up into Melody 's eyes and asked : " This is what you want ? " " Yes . " " All right , " said Jim . " I solemnly swear I will not commit adultery with Melody on this island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melody was silent . She seemed stunned with relief . " All right , " she sighed , " now I 'll swear . " Jim held the Bible for her and she said : " I solemnly swear I will not commit adultery with Jim on this island , so help me God . " " Okay , " said Jim . He stood up , put his hands on his hips and staredp267down at Melody , who continued to sit on the sand by the gnarled roots of the tree . " That 's that . " A sad little smile came on Melody 's face . " Do you hate me ? " she asked . " Of course I do n't , " said Jim . " I do n't think you 're wrong either . " " You really do n't ? " " No , I think you 're right . I think you ought to be faithful to your husband . And I think I ought to help you . I did n't want to face it , I guess I dreamed last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a dream . " " Yes , that 's all , " said Melody . " A dream . " The oath , however , was the dream . The great cloud had not swerved or turned back toward Texas , it was on the way . Advance scouts already were chirping in the thistles of the Jungfrau and pale blue feathers were falling like snow . Four weeks and four days after the wreck of the Lorna Loone , Jim and Melody and Florence were awakened early one morning by a terrificsquawking . Before any of them could get up to investigate , Rufus came padding into the cave with a sea gull in his mouth and dropped it on Florence 's stomach . Florence screamed and the bird fluttered over onto Melody 's bed and onto Melody herself , who for the sake of comfort in the tropical night slept with her pajama tops unbuttoned . Melody screamed even more loudly than Florence , twisted backward on her mattress and shoved away the dying bird , then jumped up and ran into Jim 's arms with sea gull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Melody brooded and Florence sulked , Jim slowly became more and more annoyed with both of them , especially Melody . These episodes were becoming unbearable . And so was Melody 's disposition . " Well , " said Jim , " now that this charming and delightful breakfast is over , sea gull blood and all , the day awaits us . It 's your watch , Mel-ody. "  | " What ? " asked Melody . " You heard me . I spoke perfectly plain and you heard me perfectly well . Do n't look at me innocently as if you do n't know what I said , because you do know what I said . I said it 's your watch this morning . " " No , it is n't , " she answered . " It 's your watch . " " It is not my watch , it is yours . You are acting like a child . You know damned well it 's your watch . " " I know damned well it is n't , " said Melody in an aloof , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " " Leave me out of this , " said Florence . " I do n't want to get in any arguments with you two . Besides , who cares ? There 're no ships out there anyhow . " Jim picked desultorily at his breakfast , which consisted of still anotherplate of Dinty Moore beef stew . He was sick unto death of it . But he was even more sick of the irresponsible way these women were acting . Jim stabbed at a gravy-covered piece of potato with his fork and said : " You are a pair of grasshoppers . " " You are a grasshopper yourself , " answered Melody . Jim ignored her childish riposte . It was one of the woman-simple methods she used in arguments : accuse her of something and she would accuse you right back of the same thing . She also depended heavily on flat contradiction . With an effort , Jim swallowed the potatoand said : " I have never seen such irresponsibility in my life . You complain about wanting to get off the island , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be rescued , but you wo n't lift one little pinky to do anything that might increase the odds in our favor . You 're grasshoppers , both of you . " " So are you , " said Melody . " Oh , shut up , Melody ! " " Do n't you dare tell me to shut up ! I 'll throw this beef stew right in your face and do n't you think I wo n't ! " Jim not only thought she would , he knew she would . Her hand was on the plate and fire was in her eyes . It was quite a contrast to the scene between them half an hour before when he had wiped sea gull blood from her breasts and she had put her arms around him and kissed him repeatedly on the neck . Quite a scene , that . It was the strongest erotic contact between them since the oath and Jim had a miserable ache in the pit of his stomach . She no doubt had an equivalentreaction , a misery in her vitals of whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result . These episodes were truly becoming unbearable . How in Christendom did she expect him to keep the oath , the way she was behaving ? The very idea , running into his arms and putting her bare breasts against his chest like that ! It was outrageous , intolerable , and unfair , and now she was about to throw stew on him for good measure , the evil-tempered hateful bitch . " All right , you need n't throw that stew at me , " said Jim . " Do n't you do that , Melody , do n't throw that at me . " " Then do n't tell me to shut up . " " My point is that you and Florence are not being logical . If you want to be rescued , you 've got to go out there and look for a boat . " " There are n't any boats . And I 'm warning you , do n't you tell me to shut up . If you tell me that one more time , you 'll be sorry . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there might be a boat sometime and  --  " " You are n't being logical yourself . How do you know there is n't any boat at the moment ? All you can see is part of the lagoon from the cave . There may be a boat on the other side of the island this very minute . " " Ha-ha-ha-ha , " said Jim , as he stabbed in exasperation at another piece of gravy-covered potato . Only a fool would argue with a woman . The thing to do was drop it . " And what 's so funny , may I ask ? There might be a boat . " " Yes . That is true , Melody . It was the point I was trying in my pathetic way to make , dear , when you interrupted me with that logicalgem . Yes , there may be a boat and one of us should be out there to see it so that we can light the bonfire of palm fronds I so laboriously piled up while you grasshoppers stood and watched . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , call me a grasshopperjust one more time and you 're going to get a plate of beef stew right in your face . " " All right , Melody , I apologize , " said Jim , who did not want beef stew in his face , although he briefly considered letting her throw it on him and throwing his own on her in return . That would n't work , because then she would throw the plate at him and he could hardly throw his own plate at her and hurt her . " But I must say that for a missionary 's sweet wife you have a pretty violent temper . " " I do n't have a violent temper at all , " she answered . " I just do n't like to be told to shut up and be called a grasshopper. "  | " Frankly , " said Florence , whose gaze was on her plate , " you both make me sick . " Melody turned quickly toward her . " Why do you say that , Florence ? Why do you say we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick because of what you 've done to yourselves . " " And what do you mean by that , Florence ? " Florence shrank down on the packing case upon which she was sitting , but refused to give up . " I think you know what I mean . " " I do n't know at all , " said Melody , " and I 'd like to know . " " All right , I 'll tell you , then . It 's none of my business , but I have to live here with you both so in a way it is my business . I 'm caught in the middle of this war between you two . " " War ? What war ? Are you crazy ? " " No , I 'm not crazy . You and Jim are crazy . You should never have sworn that ridiculous oath . " Florence turned to Jim . " And it 's you I blame more than Melody . You ought to have known better , Jim . " " You 're wrong , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I made him swear the oath . " " I did it voluntarily for the good of us all , " said Jim . " You do n't know what you 're talking about , Florence . " " You certainly do n't ! " said Melody . Florence shrugged . " Okay , so the war goes on . " " All right , Florence ! My patience is just about at an end . " " Are you going to throw the stew on me too , Melody ? " Florence rose from the dining table , which consisted of three cases of the Dinty Moore beef stew with a blanket spread on top . " I am going for a walk with my dog and will leave you to your war . Maybe you 'll strangle each other and settle everything . Do you want to throw the stew on me , Melody ? " Melody was silent , a hand over her eyes . She had begun to cry when Florence rose from the table . This was the pattern , temper and then tears ; or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears . Glumly , Jim watched Florence walk out of the entrance of Morgan 's TreasureCave into the sunshine . IIe had quite an ache in the pit of his stomach . The scene that had occurred half an hour before had been unbearably sexy  --  so much so , the very memory of it made him dizzy . " Melody , " said Jim . " What ? "  | " Honey , we ca n't get into situations like that . We ca n't , we just ca n't , that 's all , or . . . " " I know . " The thing had taken them all by surprise . They 'd been up late the night before , singing and playing the accordion , and they were all sound asleep when the terrific ruckus began . Jim thought some wild , dangerous animal had invaded the cave even though he knew there were no such animals on the island . Half awake , he had stumbled in his undershorts to the blanket partition and the next thing he knew Melody flew into his arms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , Jim ! Oh ! " she cried . " Oh , it frightened me to death ! I did n't know what it was , I was asleep .... " " It 's just a sea bird the dog caught . Relax , Florence is taking it out . " The scene had been terribly sexy . Although he was half awake himself and as unnerved by the raucous squawking as the women , Jim had been instantly and horribly aware of Melody 's soft , naked , pillowlike breasts against his bare chest . Over Melody 's shoulder he saw Florencewalk out of the entrance of the cave holding the dead sea gull by its feet ; she would probably go on to the latrine , which was located behind a bush fifty feet down the hill from the cave . There was time . His hands were on Melody 's shoulders in a rather brotherly way but as he saw Florence leave the cave he slid them under her pajamas onto her back . She had a beautiful back , truly beautiful , with wide handsomeshoulders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eyes closed , his right hand in the small of her back and his left hand between her shoulders , Jim gave a deep sigh and pulled her body more tightly against him . This was more like it . He could feel her mound of Venus with hard pubic bone behind it . To hell , he thought , with chaste Christian love , to hell with it once and for all , enough was enough . He had n't realized how starved he was for a woman in his arms . Melody 's head was on his shoulder and her hands on his back below his shoulder blades . " Jim , I . . . I 'm not completely dressed , " she said in a doubtful voice . As she spoke , her body pressed against him and her arms tightened around him . Slowly , with an involuntary remorselessness , her pelvis twisted to one side and then to the other , as a heavy sigh like his own came from her . Jim felt her lips on hisp272neck . " Oh , darling , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim ... " Again her lips kissed his neck , and again , and again . Her arms were around him so tightly it was difficult for him to breathe . In a daze , Jim could hear Florence outside the cave scolding Rufus . " Bad dog , bad dog ! " What an armful Melody was . God in heaven , what a woman . The breasts against his chest really and truly felt like small pillows . " Jim , " whispered Melody , " I ca n't stand this . " Florence did not seem to be going away . She was just outside the entrance of the cave , half scolding and half praising the dog . " Neither can I , " said Jim . He moved his hands down Melody 's back and slid them into the bottoms of her pajamas and spread his hands on the cheeks of her buttocks and pulled her more tightly against him . " Did you hear me ? Jim , I ca n't stand it . Please do n't . " " In a moment , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and saw Florence in the entrance of the cave . " Oh , " said Florence , " excuse me . I 'll come back later . " " No , " said Melody , " that 's all right . You can come in . It 's noth-ing . " " I 'll come back . " " Florence , I tell you it 's nothing . Stay there . It 's absolutely noth-ing . " " Nothing ? It looks to me like he has his hands on your ass . " " Jim , will you let me go ! " " Of course , sure , I 'm sorry , " said Jim , as she pushed at his chest and twisted out of his arms . " It 's nothing , Florence , " said Melody with a glazed smile . " I was frightened by the bird . Come right on in . " " Well , if you insist . I do n't want to get in your way if you want privacy . " " Oh , no , no , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream of it , it 's time for breakfast . " Jim rolled his eyes toward the rocky ceiling of the cave and shook his head . Melody , at times , could pretend the obvious truth was not the truth at all . Her performance in this case was rendered all the more ludicrous by the fact that she seemed to have forgotten her pajama tops were unbuttoned and her breasts exposed . " Well , " said Jim , " you have blood on your chest from that bird , let me get a handkerchief . "  | " Oh , I do have blood on me , do n't I ? " said Melody casually . " You both are slightly bloody , " said Florence , " and so am I. That sea gull bled all over the place . " Melody made no effort to cover herself . Hands on hips , she stared into Jim 's eyes as he walked up to her with a handkerchief . Blood was smeared on her left breast and a red trickle had run down between her breasts toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottoms were loosely tied and hung down below her hipbones so low they were practically falling off her . Jim could see not only the girlish , dentlike navel on her stomach but also a half-inch line of dark curly pubic hair above the tied bow of the pajamas . The artificial , **28;10483;TOOLONG on her face was gone . " Here , honey , " said Jim as he held out the handkerchief . Melody did not answer and did not move . Hands on hips , she stared broodinglyinto his eyes . Slowly , Jim took the handkerchief and began to wipe the blood from her breasts . He had the task about half done when she put her hands on his shoulders , rested her head on his chest , and began to cry . " Oh , for Christ 's sake , " said Florence . " I 'm getting out of here . " Jim patted Melody on the shoulder as Florence walked out of the cave . " Now , look , do n't cry , " he said . " There 's no reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim , " she answered , " it was all my fault . I 'm sorry . " " Do n't worry about it , " said Jim . Melody drew back from him and buttoned the tops of her pajamas , which were a blue and white silk polka dot pair he had bought at Saks Fifth Avenue . Melody 's trunk , which contained most of her clothing , was soaked in water down in the hold of the wreck and she had few of her things on the island . She had admired the pajamas and asked if they were expensive , and had been horrified and unbelieving when he told her he 'd paid sixty dollars for them . " How can you tell me not to worry about it ? " she asked . " When I act like that , completely shameless , awful , terrible , how can you say to me , Do n't worry about it . ' ? I do n't understand you . And I do n't understand myself either , how I could behave like that . I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do n't talk silly , honey . " " I 'm not talking silly , I 'm telling the truth . I do n't have any willpoweror character and that 's all there is to it . "  | " I think there 's quite a bit more to it . " " I do n't . You can have your theory it 's right to do a thing because you want to , but I do n't agree . " " That is n't my theory . You know it is n't . Furthermore , you have a great deal of both willpower and character . " " I wonder what your wife would think . I wonder what Charles would think if he could have seen the way I was acting . I wonder what any decent , civilized person would think . Except I do n't wonder , I know . Even an oath sworn in the sight of God does n't make any difference to me , and you tell me , Do n't worry about it . ' I deservedthat remark from Florence about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . Completely . It was my fault , the whole thing , I used the bird as an excuse . " Temper followed by tears was one pattern , passion followed by guilt was another . It was impossible to talk to her in this frame of mind . " I 'm sure we both were partly to blame , " said Jim . Later , when Melody went down the hill to go to the bathroom and wash for breakfast , Jim called to Florence over the blanket partition : " Are you angry with me ? " " No , " answered Florence . " Why should I be angry ? " " You seemed angry . " Silence , broken by a faint sound of rustling clothes as she dressed . " Can I come in ? Are you decent ? " " I suppose so , more or less . " Jim pulled aside the blanket . Florence 's hands were raised behind her to fasten the hooks of her brassiere and Jim stared at her in surprise . " Hmm , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the difference ? Will you tell me what difference it makes if you see me in a bra or not ? " " You are angry , " said Jim . Florence shoved her arms into the sleeves of her shirt and yanked the shirt together and began to button it . " I 'm just sick of you tormentingher , " she answered . " And a little weary of watching you tormentyourself . Why in the world did you ever swear that insane oath with her ? " Jim smiled . " You women amuse me . You advise me to stop tormentingMelody and go to bed with her . On the other hand , she advised me eight days ago to go to bed with you . " " Me ? " asked Florence . " Yes , she says you love me. "  | " That 's very funny , " said Florence , " but you have n't answered my question . Why in heaven 's name did you swear that oath with her ? " " I had no choice , " answered Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florence . " " You could have refused very easily . You could have just said no . The truth is you agree with her  --  or at least you did agree with her . Do you still ? " " I could n't possibly refuse her , Florence . But if you want to know , yes , I agree with her . I do n't think I ought to have an affair with her and get her pregnant and wreck her marriage and ruin her life , no . And we 're not going to break that oath . We 're human and because of the accident this morning we were tempted , but nothing is going to happen , Florence . Nothing . I guarantee you . " " Do you know what ? There 's a fanatical glitter in your eyes and I believe you . " " Oh , to hell with you , " said Jim . He walked out of the " bedroom " and angrily yanked shut the blanket partition . Florence was jealous and wanted Melody for herself . She did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she thought he would break it . Thus , at breakfast on a beautiful morning four weeks and four days after the wreck of the Lorna Loone , while Melody brooded and Florencesulked , Jim Kittering slowly became more and more annoyed with both of them , especially Melody . An idiotic argument occurred at the very beginning of the meal on the question of whose turn it was to get water . " It 's your turn , Melody , " said Florence . " No , it 's Jim 's turn . " " It is not my turn , " said Jim . " I got the water yesterday . " " All right , and I got it day before yesterday , " said Melody . " It 's Florence 's turn . " " I cooked the stew , " said Florence . " It is n't fair to me to have to cook the breakfast and get the water too . " " You opened a can and struck a match and held it for three secondsto that kerosene stove I lugged all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after taking it off that wreck at the risk of my life . " " I also set the table , " said Florence sulkily . " Florence , it 's your turn to get the water , " said Jim . " I never heard such a chauvinistic , mealy-mouthed argument in my life . " " Oh , shit ! " said Florence . " Life in this cave is disgusting ! "  | " It is when people talk like that , " said Melody primly . She turned to Jim as Florence threw her napkin on the table and walked out with the pitcher . " And you are no better when it comes to that kind of language . In fact , you 're worse . " Jim resisted an impulse to say something obscene to her , contenting himself with a mere : " Uh-huh . " " You need n't say ' Uh-huh ' to me in that rude way as if I 'm a stupid child . I 'm just as intelligent as you are and I resent being patronized . Furthermore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Florence 's , by far . You talk in a very filthy way , like a little schoolboy trying to shock someone . " Jim gritted his teeth , smiled , and said , " All right , Melody . " " And I wish you 'd stop it . " " I will try and stop it . " " I mean really try and stop it . " " I will really try . " Melody was silent for a while , then said : " Actually , I think it was your turn to get the water , Jim . " " Um-hmmm . " " Florence got it yesterday . " " Mmm . " Again she was silent for a while . Jim knew from experience she was working herself into the mood to say something really nasty . He was determined not to play . Let her say anything she wanted to and he would agree with it or at least make no comment . However , on this occasion she caught him by surprise and threw him . " Jim ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense . " Briefly , spots of fury winked before Jim 's eyes . Damnable bitch , to say such a thing after he 'd worn himself out working for her and had sweated blood worrying about her . Through his teeth , Jim replied : " Do n't I ? " " No , I 'm afraid you do n't . You have no more moral sense than an animal in a barnyard . Going around all the time without your shirt is the least of it . It 's the way you act , the way you talk and smile and everything else , and I 'm sick and tired of it ! I ca n't endure your behaviorany longer ! Do you understand me ? " " No , frankly , I do n't . A saint might understand you , but not me. "  | " Well , I understand you . It took me a while , you fooled me , I admit , but now I know you for what you are , Jim . I had a horrible dream about you the other night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push me off a cliff , and that inhuman hog-man was you . Yes , you , Jim . Charles came along and took my hand and saved me , after I 'd thrown a rock at the hog-man and killed it . " Again spots winked before Jim 's eyes . The impulse to throttle her was almost overwhelming . " So you think I 'm a hog-man , huh , " he said . " After I 've driven myself half crazy staying away from you and worked myself half to death trying to help and protect you , that 's what you think of me . " Melody stared at him with an implacable anger in which there was not even the faintest shred of gratitude . " You 're a hypocrite , " shesaid . " You do n't live by the things you say you believe in . What 's more , you did n't work all that hard . Most of the time you made me and Florence do the work . " " You and Florence , work ? Ha ! " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , and Florence with her ribs broken and her side all hurting . That 's your idea of being a gentleman . Wonderful . " " What do you expect of a hog-man like me ? " asked Jim . It was a painful meal and the misery did n't end after Florence had gone . As a rule , once she began to cry , Melody became contrite . Not this time . The days of contrition were over . It had started quietly with an effort on his part to make her realize such scenes as that inspired by the sea gull could not be allowed to happen . " Honey , we ca n't get into situations like that . We ca n't , we just ca n't , that 's all , or . . . " " I know . " 11 " I do n't want to talk to you in a clinical way , I know you hate that kind of talk , but we 've got to face the fact that beyond a certain pointno one can control himself ... or herself either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain point , it happens , " she answered . " I 'm very aware of that . " " I hope you are . " " I am . I 'm not a child . " " Then we must n't get in such situations again . " " No , of course we must n't . " Melody was silent for several seconds ,  |p278then  said , " Jim , I 'm sorry I threatened to throw the beef stew on you. , , " That 's all right , you were upset because  --  " " I 'm also sorry I called you a hog-man . Of course you 're nothing like that , you 're just immature . " Jim forced himself to wait before answering her , but it was impossible for him to remain calm . She was beyond doubt the most infuriatingwoman he had ever known . To be called immature was worse than being called a hog-man . " Look , " he said , " you want to fight with me because of what happened this morning . Well , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was you who came running into my arms , not me into yours . And I must say , that 's the oldest cliche there is . Oh , the thunder  --  darling ! Oh , a mouse  --  darling ! ' In this situation , it was a convenient sea gull . " " How can you tell such a lie ? You know that bird frightened me , I was n't putting that on . " " I 'm sure it frightened you , but you admitted yourself you used it as an excuse and now you 're blaming me for it and calling me a hogmanand immature . " " Yes , but you would n't let me go . I asked you to , and you would n't , and now you say it 's all my fault . That 's the coward 's way , Jim . Only a moral coward puts all the blame on somebody else . And that 's what you are , Jim , an immature moral coward . " " I do n't want to talk to you , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she answered . " I do n't want to talk to you either . You are the most cruel and hateful man I 've ever known . " " Oh , go to hell , " said Jim . Melody 's eyes flashed toward the kerosene stove and for a moment Jim thought she would throw a pot at him , but she did n't . A pot was not enough . In an unnaturally calm voice she said : " That is the end . Do you hear me ? " " Sure , I hear you . A hog-man has ears . " " Then listen to this . You are a hog-man , Jim , and you 've done your best to ruin and destroy me in every little subtle way you can . " " I 'll tell you what you are , Melody . You 're an oversexed hysterical nitwit and a phony Christian , and you can take a flying jump and kiss my ass . " Jim was sure she 'd throw a pot at him this time and he did n't give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You are right , " she said . " I amp279a phony Christian , and the other too . A good Christian and a decent woman would n't feel about you the way I do . I hate you , Jim . I hate you for what you are and for what you 've aroused in me . But it 's finished and ended . I will not speak to you again while we 're on this island . " " Thank God for something , " said Jim . Melody spent the morning writing a long letter , undoubtedly to her husband . In tears , she tore it up around noon . She had eaten practicallyno breakfast and ate no lunch at all . In a wan tone she explained to Florence : " I have no appetite . " She would n't speak to Jim and would n't even look at him . He was on watch that afternoon at Morgan'sArmchair and was glad to get away from her ; the sun-baked rocks and cactus thorns of the Matterhorn were a relief in comparison . Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to her daily bath and deliberately turned and scanned the sea in other directions in order not to look at her . He 'd regretted almost immediately his final insult , especially the part about her being " oversexed , " but he did n't want to look at her or think about her . As far as he was concerned , the best thing that could happen would be for a flying saucer to pick up the damnable bitch and take her to Venus . Nevertheless , as he gazed out at featureless blue sea and empty blue sky , Jim wondered how long this impossible war could continue . If a flying saucer did not take Melody to Venus , what then ? Upon his return in late afternoon , Florence met him at the entrance of the cave and reported that Melody was lying on her bed reading the Bible and weeping and brooding . " What do you want me to do about it ? " asked Jim . " I just thought you might like to know how things stand , " answeredFlorence . " She says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the island with you . " " She told you that , huh ? " " Yeah . She wants me to help her build a raft so we can float to Central America . " " Oh , Christ , " said Jim wearily . " I thought of a raft the first day , Florence . The wood of the trees on this island is heavy as iron . It wo n't float . " " She also mentioned the life raft from the ship . " " It 's half full of water , " said Jim , " and there 's no way to rig a sail on it . We would n't have a prayer . "  | " Looks like we 're stuck then , does n't it ? Here we are and here we will remain , until fate whimsically releases us . " " Yeah , " said Jim . " Well , I 'm sorry the way I myself acted this morning . A little loss of control there . " " You were nothing compared to her . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the things we were saying to each other . " " I can imagine . It must have been gruesome . " Florence lifted a sardonic eyebrow . " And by the way , speaking of the things people say , I hope you did n't take seriously the thing Melody said about my feelingstoward you . She 's very romantic and naive . " " She 's crazy , " said Jim . " I never realized it before , but she 's crazy . " Florence smiled . " She is n't crazy . She 's just emotional and very naive . " " She 's crazy in the sense that she has no grasp of the reality of her own nature and no grasp of the reality of her situation here on the island . Can you imagine it ? She actually in all seriousness offered you as a kind of substitute for herself . I wonder how she 'd be acting now if I 'd taken her up on it , if you and I were living together and she was all alone . " Florence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her up on it ? Would n't I have something to say about it ? " " Well , you could reject me , of course . But she suggested I try . " " I suggest you do n't . I do n't want to make hostile noises at a man I like as much as I do you , Jim , but I 'm afraid I would scratch your eyes right out of your head . " Jim nodded thoughtfully . Florence sat in the entrance of the cave with her arms around the neck of her dog Rufus , who was panting in a " smiling " way and seemed to enjoy it . As she talked to Jim , she embraced the animal with a tender protectiveness , arms tightly around him and a hand on his shaggy head . Her small breasts were against the dog 's side . There was , Jim felt , something incongruous and pathetic about her love for Rufus . He smiled and said : " You really love that dog , do n't you , Florence ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what I just said . " Jim hesitated . Her arms were now even more tightly around the dog and the look of fear and dread in her eyes was unmistakable . " You know , it 's funny , " he said . " I 've worried a lot about you sincep281we 've been on the island . One of the reasons I swore that oath with Melody was because of you . " " Because of me ? " " Yes , I was afraid of what would happen to you if Melody and I became involved here . It seemed to me this would be very bad for you , but do you know something ? I think I was dead wrong . " Florence 's freckles stood out like measles against the pallor of her face . " Why do you think that ? " " Well , would n't you rather have a human being in your arms than a dog ? " " No , I would n't . " " I think you would . " Florence stood up . " I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " It 'd be a pity for you to have to go around the island tapping with a cane . " How could he have been so stupid , how could it have taken him so long to understand Florence ? Even now , shaking at the knees and gazing at him in stunned fear , she had her hand gently around the dog 's neck and her leg against his side . Crazy and impossible as Melody'sidea had been , she was fundamentally right about Florence . " You 'd scratch out my eyes and blind me , huh ? You 'd do a cruel thing like that to me ? " " I sure as hell would , " said Florence . " Come on , Rufus , let 's go for our sunset walk . The man is talking filthy . " Jim watched Florence walk off down the hill with Rufus , then he turned and looked up at the rock formation called Morgan 's Armchair on top of the Matterhorn , the wilder of the two hills on Providence Island . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sunset also was very beautiful in the lagoon , which changed color as the light reddened and dimmed . Jim got up and walked into the cave . The blanket partition of the women 's bedroom was drawn . He went over to it and asked : " Melody , are you dressed ? " Silence . " Honey , we ca n't get off this island and we ca n't live here without talking to each other . Are you dressed ? " Jim heard her take a deep breath and sigh , then he heard a sniff , and another sniff , and finally : " Yes , I 'm dressed . What do you want ? " " I want to ask you something . Can I come in ? " " No , not right now . I 'll come out in a minute . "  | " Okay , " said Jim . He walked over to a canvas deck chair in the living area of the cave and sat down . A few seconds later , Melody pulled open the blanket partition and came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a handkerchief in the other . Head bowed , weeping and biting at her lip , she sat down in a deck chair across from Jim . " Florence has gone for her sunset walk with Rufus , " he said . " Would you like to go for a walk with me ? " A weepy expression came on Melody 's face and her shoulders shook as she suppressed a sob . Again she bit at her lip , sniffed , rubbed her eyes with the handkerchief , and replied : " It 's only an hour before supper . " " I know , but that 's long enough for a walk . I thought maybe you 'd like to see the sunset from the top of the hill . Or maybe you 'd like to go for a swim . " " A swim ? " Melody fumbled in her lap for her glasses and put them on . " Well , " she said , in a voice so low Jim could barely hear her , " I . . . I do n't have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It . . . it 's too tight , uncomfortable . " " It was just an idea . I thought you might like to go swimming , since you never have here on the island . " " No , I never have , that 's true . And I ... I 've often thought of it , I love to swim . But Florence 's suit is much too tight . " " I should think it would be . " " It is , I tried it on , it 's very uncomfortable . Of course , I suppose I could swim in my underwear . Once I was in the water it would n't matter . " " It would n't matter anyhow , " said Jim . " A brassiere and panties are about as much bathing suit as anybody wears these days , honey . " " Yes . . . I suppose so , but . . . " " Or we could just go for a walk . Whatever you want . " Melody dried the tears from her cheeks with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It might do me good to get out of here a little . " " Shall I put on my trunks , in case we decide to go swimming ? " " Well , yes , " said Melody . In the palm grove a few yards from the beach , Melody 's voice began to tremble as she discussed the weather . " I thought it would rain this afternoon , " she said . " You know , when the , clouds came up . But it did n't , it never did rain . "  | " Sometimes it does n't . " " No . But sometimes when you think it wo n't , it does . " " That 's true , " said Jim . The lagoon was dark green but still luminous as a jewel in the late afternoon sunshine . The beach remained a crescent of pure white with tiny mica sparkles and bits of irridescent seashell . Melody had given up her feeble effort to converse on the weather and Jim felt a pity for her . She was fiddling nervously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hateful dress she had been wearing when he first saw her by the gangplank of the Lorna Loone , but although he thought of the dress as hateful Jim had a certain ambivalence toward it  --  he had , after all , fallen in love with her when she had it on . Very pale , very frightened , Melody stared out at the beach and the emerald water . Slowly , she raised her hands to the neck of her dress , undid one button , another , and another , then paused . " I 'm sorry , I know it 's silly , but . . . would you turn your head for a moment ? " " Sure , " said Jim . He faced the lagoon , folded his arms across his chest , and waited . He heard a faint lap of waves on the sand and the sound of his own heart beating in his ears , then a rustle , another rustle , and a light whisper that had to be the gray dress falling to the sand . " You may as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's foolish of me , you 've seen me with nothing on at all . " " Yes , I have , " said Jim . Melody stood before him in her brassiere and panties , a shy expression on her face and her shoulders **27;10513;TOOLONG in such a way as to exaggerate the depth of the valley between her breasts . As always , the Hera-like voluptuousness of her body hit him with a slight shock . He knew the body was there , but the revelation of it was like a trick of magic . The gray dress about which Jim had feelings of ambivalence lay on the sand at the foot of a coconut palm . He took her hand and said : " Let 's go swimming before it gets dark . " " All right . But do you have a pocket ? " Jim lifted the underwater mask he 'd tied to his trunks . " Sure , a big one here under the mask . " " Keep my glasses for me , then . I just hope I have n't forgotten how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her nervousness and shynessdisappeared after she waded into the water . Since she 'd never seen tropical fish in their natural habitat , they swam out near thep284rusting wreck of the ship in order for her to look at the reef and the fish through the underwater mask . Jim managed to fit the mask over her glasses and she ducked down for a look . Her reaction to the spectacularreef and fish did not surprise him ; he had expected some sort of religious or at least mystical comment . " It 's beautiful beyond words , " she said . " I do n't see how anyone can look at that reef and those fish and not believe in God . " Gradually they worked their way up the beach along the line of the reef to the deeper pool by the cove . Melody was a strong swimmer , as she had claimed during the hurricane . She swam with an oldfashionedbut powerful Australian crawl and it was difficult for Jim to keep up with her . He was winded when they reached the cove , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jim stood watching her do underwater somersaults , first her feet , then her head and shoulders breaking the surface of the lagoon . Smiling , she called to him , " Can you do that ? " Jim put on the underwater mask , swam out to her , ducked under the water , and there she was in a soundless crystal world , arms and legs slowly moving . He could see the indented lines of her brassiere but the rayon panties were so transparent he thought for a moment they had either come off while she was swimming or that she herself had taken them off . Jim swam under her and surfaced behind her and pulled her hair . Treading water and smiling , she turned toward him . Jim grinned back at her . " Under water it looks like you 've got nothing on at all , " he said . " It feels like I 've got nothing on , " said Melody , " except for the bra . Water keeps ballooning in the cups . " " Take it off , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would people think ? " She was smiling and joking , her lips pressed together in a manner Jim found very attractive . There was also a childlike flirtatiousness in her eyes that he found extremely charming . He pushed the mask up on his forehead , reached behind her with one hand , got a hook of the bra unfastened , and sank bubbling under the water . Again , but dimly , without benefit of the underwater mask , he saw her arms and legs moving in slow motion through the crystal-clear water . He dogpaddledto the surface and heard her laughing at him . " Ha ha ha , serves you right  --  that 's what you get for being so fresh . " " I was just trying to help you . You said water balloons in the cups . "  | " It does . " " Then take the silly thing off . " " All right . But keep it in your belt and give it back . " " Okay . " " Do you promise ? " " Yes , sure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling at Jim , Melody reached behind herself . She managed to keep her head above water . " See ? It 's off . " The brassiere landed in the water beside Jim . Deliberately , he ignored it . " Hey , do n't let it sink ! You 'll lose it and I wo n't be able to get out ! " Jim put on the underwater mask , dived for the brassiere , and found it floating limp and empty three feet below the surface . Melody 's arms and legs still were moving in slow motion and so now were her breasts , lifting and rising gently , free of the brassiere and more beautifulthan any angel or parrot fish or any coral reef . Her breasts moved with the current of the water ; the nipple centers moved a little bit together , a little bit apart , went slightly up , went slightly down  --  she looked cross-eyed , cuckoo , startled , and absorbed in her navel by turns . Fascinated by the gentle feminine eyes staring at him in the clear water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jim forgot the necessity to breathe and came to the surface , gasping . " Did you find it ? " Jim held up the bra . " Yeah , but I had some trouble . A couple of eyes were staring at me down there . " " You should n't look at such things . " " I could n't help it . They were looking at me . " " Turn a somersault and get it out of your mind , then you 'll feel better . " " I do n't feel bad . " " Go on , turn a somersault , I want to see you do it . " Jim turned several somersaults to oblige her , then said , " Okay , that 's enough , let 's go ashore . " " Well , give me my bra . " " You do n't need it . " " Yes , I do , give it to me . " Jim handed her the brassiere and she swam toward shore till her feet touched sand , then she put on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the beach.  | " Did you like it ? " asked Jim . " I loved it . " " I should have taken you swimming before . " " Yes , you should have . Except I probably would n't have gone . I had to get completely miserable first . " " Yeah , maybe so . " Jim glanced toward the big tree at the foot of the cliff , the tree under which he had sworn not to commit adultery with Melody on Providence Island . Out of nowhere the recollection came to him of a rather bad motion picture starring Gary Cooper and a Swiss or Austrian actress not too active these days . " The Hanging Tree " it was called , with a murky ballad that sobbed optimistically that nothing was closer to the Tree of Life than a good old fundamentalHanging Tree . And he had thought his play with the names of the tree was rather cute . Banality was sly as Asian flu and one ballad leads to another . " Oh , I committed adultery with my darlin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swore we would n't do no such thang . . . . " Jim could hear it , he could see Hob approvingly narrow his eyes and make a little triumphant circle with his thumb and forefinger . " Why are you smiling ? " asked Melody . " Just thinking of something , " said Jim . " What ? " In a sudden daze , Jim stopped to consider . There was still time , nothing had to happen , compulsion was only a word . He could lead her to the palm grove , help her into her pale gray dress , and take her back to the cave . Of course , it would be a hog-man kind of thing to do , a cruel and hateful thing . . . indeed it would . To hell with appearancesand to hell with Hob . " I was just thinking how pretty you look with that dress off , " said Jim . " I do n't want you to ever put that thing back on , just leave it where it is in the coconut grove . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that dress myself . I 've always hated it . " " Leave it lie , then . " Jim took her hand . " Let 's go sit under the tree . " Her smile faded slightly . " That tree ? " " Yes . It 's only a tree . " " All right , " said Melody . The sun was getting low behind the hill , but there was still plentyp287of light beneath the umbrella-like limbs of the tree . As Melody sat beside him on the sand , Jim could see the nipples of her breasts and the dark triangle of her pubic hair through her wet underthings . The shyness had come upon her again . Timidly and nearsightedly , she stared at him in silence . " I know you just put this back on , " said Jim , " but let 's take it off again . " He reached behind her , unfastened her brassiere and pulled it off , then put his arms around her and kissed her . She returned the kiss and he kissed her again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " Sit back and raise up for a second . " Melody leaned back on her elbows and lifted her hips clear of the sand as he pulled down her wet panties . He then took off his own swimming trunks and a moment later found himself in a position similar to the one he 'd been in when Florence burst upon them in the life-raft closet during the hurricane . The only difference was that Melody had her ankles locked and her arms across her breasts . Jim put his hands on her shoulders and his knee between her legs . " Jim . . . we swore we would n't . " " I know , " he said . " We 're going to break the oath . " Melody slowly uncrossed her ankles and put her hands on either side of Jim 's face . Her legs were still together , her eyes opened wide in an effort to see into his own . Jim felt her legs move apart . For a moment he hesitated , then in dreamlike shock he felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she whispered , " I love you , I love you . . . . " It had taken Jim a month to get the Goblin Special back on the air , but it did not seem to him a Goblin Special at all . Hands on her breasts , enveloped in the warmth of her body , Jim stared into her eyes and whispered : " I love you too ... " Jim awakened at dawn with the feeling that something catastrophic had occurred . For a groggy half-minute he could not think what thing it was , then he remembered the bluebird feathers , the sea gull blood , the Hanging Tree of Life , and all the rest . He whispered , " Oh , God . " Something had to be done about this . If the memory of events madep288him want to jump in the ocean , what would it do to Melody ? Jim got up , silently dressed , climbed to the top of the hill , and sat down on Morgan 's Pillow , then for an hour struggled to find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tree . It was there the idea came to him , on top of old Jungfrau in the pearly dawn . A tense , awkward silence prevailed during the first five minutes of breakfast , which consisted as usual of inescapable Dinty Moore beef stew and tongue-furring canned grapefruit juice . Florence , whose eyes were pink from weeping and who was in an unconcealable dither of nerves , finally could endure it no longer . " Well , " she asked , " is anyonegoing to say anything ? " " Mmm , " said Jim . " Very well , I 'll say something . Frankly , I am glad . The situation around here had become impossible and I 'm happy for you both . " Melody , who looked ill , glanced up briefly at Florence . She seemed to have lost the power of speech . " Look , " said Florence , " I know it 's none of my business , Melody , but when you come in stark naked at three in the morning we ca n't just pretend nothing happened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Melody , her gaze fixed on her plate of beef stew , which she had not touched . " I do n't mean to pretend . " " And I do n't mean to poke my nose where it does n't belong either , " said Florence . " But we have to live together in this cave , Melody , all three of us , and I think there are a few things we had better face honestly here and now . Do n't you agree ? " " Yes . " " All right . First of all , living arrangements . This cave , I regret to say , provides damned little privacy . I see nothing we can do about it , we ca n't build you a boudoir with two-by-fours and plaster and flocked wallpaper with rosebuds . But in view of last night I assume that you and Jim will now want to share our present bedroom . " " I do n't want any breakfast , " said Melody . " What did I say ? " asked Florence . " Nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want to embarrass you and I do n't want to interfere with you and Jim in any way . But we 've simply got to decide a few things , such as living arrangements here in the cave , who 's going to sleep where , and so forth . I assume , Jim , you will want to change bedrooms with me ? " " Maybe we 'd better talk about it later , " Jim said.  | " I want to get it settled here and now , " replied Florence . " It 's on my mind and it bothers me . I agree to change bedrooms , that 's reasonable . But , as I said before , there 's very little privacy in the cave . God knows I 'm not an expert in this area or what you 'd call an authority . . . but do n't people in love want privacy ? " Jim lowered his eyes in discomfort . Florence was indeed in a dither of nerves ; Jim was afraid she would begin to cry at any moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to jump on her and hurt her feelings . Head bowed , he listened to her . " I guess people in love do , I 'm sure they do . . . I mean , want to be alone , but I have to stay in the cave , there 's nowhere else for me to go , at night I have to stay here . But I can go out during the afternoons and walk .... " Melody stood up , a hand on her stomach . " I really do n't feel well , " she said . " Melody , I do n't want to be in the way , but where can I go ? " " Florence , we 'll talk about it later , " said Jim . " I ca n't sleep in the cactus bushes , what 's to become of me ? I do n't want to invade your privacy , but I ca n't help it in this . . . this damned cave ! " " I said that 's enough , we 'll talk about it later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film of tears in her eyes . " Jim . . . Jim , I 'm just trying to be calm and sensible . You do n't have to shout at me like that . " " I did n't shout at you . " " Please excuse me , " said Melody , hand on her stomach and eyes averted from them both . " I 'm going to lie down , I feel sick . " " Sit down and eat your breakfast , Melody , " said Jim . " The reason you feel sick is because you have n't eaten anything since day before yesterday . " " No , I really am sick . " " You 're not sick , your stomach is empty , that 's all . Now , sit down and eat , then I want you to come with me to the Elysian Field . There 's something I 'd like to discuss with you . " " What ? " " Come on , honey , eat some of the stew . " " Oh , Jim , I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We 're all sick of it , but eat it anyhow , then you 'll feel better . " " What is it you want to discuss ? " " I 'll tell you later . Eat some breakfast . " Jim managed to coax and nag her into drinking a glass of grapefruitp290juice and eating half a plate of stew , at which point Florence made a choking sound and abruptly got up and walked out . " Oh , Christ , " said Jim . " I guess I spoke too rough to her , but what could I do ? She 'll just have to adjust , that 's all . " " Adjust , " said Melody . " How can she adjust when her heart is broken ? I told you how she feels about you , now maybe you 'll believe me . " " She 's just in a generalized dither , " said Jim , " and on your account as well as mine . " " She 's in a dither on my account , all right . She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . " " That 's completely your imagination , Melody . Florence is a hypersensitiveperson and she 's upset , but I 'm sure she 's sincere about being glad about . . . last night . " " She wants to be glad , but she is n't . " Melody stared morosely at the remains of her stew . " Jim , I ca n't eat any more of this . " " Eat just a little more . " Melody reluctantly picked at the stew with her fork . " I did n't know she saw me . I thought it was dark and raining . " " The moon was out a little . I guess she saw you when you came in the entrance . " " Well , I knew she was awake . When I came in she did n't make a sound , but later I heard her crying . She had her face buried in the pillow but I could hear her . Then this morning she looked at me like I was a vampire and my hair was all snakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very jealous . I hope she gets over it . " " I 'm sure she 'll get over it . What else can she do ? Frankly , at the moment I 've got other things to worry about than Florence . " " It should have been her under that tree , not me , " said Melody . " I told you that in the first place , but you would n't listen . But do n't worry , I 'm not going to burden you with my conscience or recriminationsor anything like that . And I hope you wo n't either . There 's no point . " " I know . But there is something I want to discuss with you . Let 's take a walk to the meadow . " " Oh , Jim , I ca n't , I 've got to lie down . I have a bad headache , I 'm sick to my stomach and I feel terrible , awful ... " " I know how you feel . Come for a walk and you 'll feel better . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills of the is/land , Melody 's spirits did seem to improve slightly . Jim led her to a little sheltered grassy pocket in the center of the meadow and they sat down and watched puffs of fair-weather clouds pass over the island . " It 's a beautiful day , " said Melody . " Yes , it is , " answered Jim . " The sunrise was fantastic this morning at Morgan 's Pillow . The whole island turned red , then pearly pink , and the ocean shined like gold . " " Is that where you went , up on the hill ? " " Yes . I woke very early and went up there because I wanted to think . And that 's what I did . I thought about everything from beginning to end . " Melody stared into her lap . " Did you ? " she said . Jim glanced around at the Jungfrau on one side of the meadow , then turned and looked at the Matterhorn on the other side . The idea he 'd had at Morgan 's Pillow seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring it up without sounding ridiculous ? " It 's very beautiful here , " he said , " on the island . " " Yes , the beauty of the island helps . At least we 're not stuck in some ugly place . It 's all beautiful , except those horrible rocks Florence likes . " " Even the rocks have a beauty of a kind . " " I suppose so . Jim , I 'd like to go back and lie down soon . What was it you wanted to discuss with me ? " Jim felt a slight shortness of oxygen , despite the trade wind that blew with a gentle constancy through the valley between the hills . He took a deep breath and said : " Well , Melody . . . no recriminations , no mea culpa tears , I agree with you , what happened happened . But as I told you at breakfast , there is something I want to say to you . First , I want to say that I love you . After last night , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to realize it 's true . I do love you and I want your happiness more than I want anything else . Do you believe me ? " Melody 's eyes softened a bit . " Of course I believe you , " she said . " I know you love me . " " All right , " said Jim . He took another breath and said : " Melody , we might be on this island five years . Now , I think you love me the same way I do you . I think you want me to be happy just as I want you to be happy . Therefore , I suggest we get married . " Melody stared thoughtfully at him . " You suggest we get married ? "  | " Yes . " Melody slowly shook her head . " Jim , I 'm sorry , we talked about that . I do love you , but there are other people involved and we are n't suited . We really are n't , Jim . " " We are n't suited for the outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm asking you to marry me here on the island . " " Marry you here on the island ? " " Yes . " " But I 'm already married and so are you . " " True , but we are not married on this island , we are single on this island . Very single . And we ca n't go on being single on this island , Melody , it 's impossible . You know that as well as I do . " " But how can we get married if we 're already married ? " " You do n't understand . We are not married here , we are married in the outside world . Here , on this island , we are single . Therefore , I suggest we get married and live together as lawful man and wife for such time as we are on the island . " " I see . You mean for such time as we are on the island ? " " Yes . Until we return to the outside world . " " Such a marriage would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Melody . It would be legal . " " But who could marry us here ? " " I 'm sure Florence could do it . " " Florence ? " " Yes , she could do it . " " Jim , you 're crazy . She 's not a minister or anything like it . " " That 's only a technicality . It would n't matter as long as she said the words and we answered . " " But we are n't divorced . You 're talking completely crazy . Why , even if Florence did marry us in some kind of ceremony , you 'd still be married to Linda and I 'd still be married to Charles . It would be a form of double bigamy , Jim , if it was anything at all . " " No , it would n't . On the island we would only be married to each other , honey , so it would n't be bigamy . And it would n't be adultery either . It would be a strictly lawful marriage . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Lawful ? " Melody was staring at him in absorbed fascination , her headache and her stomach-ache now forgotten . " I do n't see how it could be lawful . "  | " Let me explain it to you as I see it . First , laws  --  that is to say , society 's laws  --  are made by people . We are the people on this island and therefore it 's up to us to make the laws on it . Actually , we already have laws here . Such things as all of us helping keep the cave clean and orderly , sharing the food we have , not hurting each other , and so forth . For example , if Rufus catches a wild pig , we have a law that we share equally , because we are all sick of beef stew and it would n't be fair otherwise . Is n't that true ? " " We do n't actually have a law about it . " " We have an unwritten law . Suppose I tried to eat all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any ? You 'd quote that law at me pretty quick , would n't you ? " " We would say it 's unfair , there ought to be a rule ... " " That 's all any law is , honey , a rule . And if we can have a law about sharing food , we can have other laws , including marriage laws . There 's nothing to prevent us from convening the legislature  --  you , me , and Florence  --  and passing a law that my marriage to Linda and your marriage to Charles are hereby declared null and void on this island , until such time as Linda and Charles show up in a row boat . " " But Jim , you know they wo n't . " " No , they wo n't . Therefore , in reality , our marriages to them are null and void on this island , and such a law would only be taking sensible recognition of that fact . This is a basic function of law , to take sensible recognition of the truth . All great courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Linda and Charles are n't here ... " " No , they 're not , therefore from a standpoint of law our marriages to them do n't exist on this island . I am sure that would be the decisionof any competent court if the question were put to a serious test . " " Well , maybe from the standpoint of law . . . I do n't know , they decide all kinds of funny things these days . " " Melody , the Supreme Court would n't consider it bigamy . I 'd bet my last dollar on it . " " The Supreme Court . . . they 're against prayer in the schools , too . Maybe they would n't . Maybe not . But there 's more to it than that , Jim . " " Yes , there is , " said Jim . " There 's a lot more to it than anything the Supreme Court might say about Linda and Charles or you and me , because another person is involved . "  | " Another person ?  --  you mean Florence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpless than Florence . I mean your baby , if you have one . " A worried indentation appeared on Melody 's forehead . " Yes , " she said , " the baby . I 've tried not to think about that this morning and I 'd rather not talk about it . But you 're right , someone else is in-volved . " " Let 's say , might be involved . " " Is , " she answered . " I 'll have a baby . " Jim smiled . " You think you have morning sickness so soon ? " " I might not have morning sickness yet , but I will . If I 'm not pregnantalready , I will be soon . I ca n't help myself . " With a wan smile , Melody put her hand on his . " I want you now a hundred times more . I want you even with a headache and sick to my stomach . You 'd think I 'd have something else on my mind , but no . Not me . Believe it or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles is right , and so are you . I 'm oversexed . " Jim squeezed her hand in exasperation . " Now listen , " he said . " I will always regret saying that to you , because it 's ridiculous . Believe me , you are a perfectly normal woman , Melody . " " It 's normal to be made love to three times and wake up four hours later and want to be made love to again ? That 's normal ? " " It certainly is . You 've been bitterly frustrated for months . I assure you any normal woman would react exactly as you have , especially if she had a strong emotional attachment to the man . " " Maybe so , but I do n't believe it . I do n't think other women feel the way I do . " " You 're wrong  --  and dangerously wrong . We have more important things to talk about , but let me say this . Nature , in the course of evolution , has overcompensated the human sex drive as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basis of civilizationitself . People are a thousand times sexier and smarter than other animals and that 's why they 're human . Now you 'd better learn to live with this fact about yourself and stop mewling about it like a child . You 'd be better off and so would your husband . " Open-mouthed , Melody gawked at him . Finally she said , " That 's ridiculous . Sex is just an urge . It is n't the basis for civilization ; love and cooperation are the basis for civilization . " " That 's what I just said , " answered Jim . " Power of mind and a capacity for love define a human being . I do n't mean by sex a simplep295moronic urge such as animals have , but a complex emotional , spiritual , and physical phenomenon that defies analysis . But let 's suspend this discussion  --  I want to talk to you about the baby you might have here . The point is , you might have a baby and that 's the main reason I think we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " Oh , Jim , stop talking about our getting married , that 's crazy ! " " As I was saying , marriage is n't just a license to go to bed together , it 's hardly that at all . The main purpose of marriage is to protect the young , that 's what the institution is really for . And since I love you , I want to protect you and your child . " Melody pursed her lips in a prim manner , a coolness in her eyes . She obviously did n't like being told her brave confession of wickedness was mere mewling . " That 's sweet of you but I do n't see how you can . I 'm afraid it 'll be up to me and others to take care of any baby I have . " " What others ? " " Well . . . those who care about me . " " I care about you . I told you when we first sat down here I love you and want your happiness more than anything else , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , then you tell me I 'm mewling like a child . " " You were . " " That 's your opinion . But actually , when I said those who care about me I meant my husband . Whatever our feelings toward each other and no matter what 's happened , I am married , Jim , and Charlesis my husband . " " And nine days ago you told me at great length how you did n't think he 'd be your husband long if you were unfaithful to him and got pregnant on this island . " " I also said he has more feeling for other people than anyone I 've ever known . Charles will forgive me . " " I hope he will , but you did n't think he would last week , Melody . You told me flatly he could n't endure to accept and raise another man 's child as his own . " Melody 's lip began to tremble . " Why are you trying to make me feel bad ? " she asked . " Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm not trying to make you feel bad , I 'm trying to make you face this situation as it is , for your good and for the good of any baby you might have . "  |p296Melody  's lip trembled more . " I might not even have one . The doctorscould be wrong , I might be like Charles and unable to have chil-dren . " Jim waited patiently while she took out a handkerchief and began to cry into it . A few tears and she would calm down and perhaps be able to talk rationally . It was senseless , in any event , to point out to her the irony of tears caused by fear that she would get pregnant followed by tears caused by fear that she would n't . As he sat watching Melody weep in her handkerchief , the thought occurred to Jim Kitteringthat the emotional nature of women really was different from that of men , and that the difference could not be wholly due to culture , training , or attitudes . It was a reactionary viewpoint , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense , women were grasshoppers . The emotional qualities needed for motherhood were different in kind from the reasoning powers needed for the hunt  --  and that was the division of labor from time immemorial ; the raising of children by women and the providing of food for women and children by men . As Melody wept over her fear of pregnancy and her fear of nonpregnancy , Jim wondered if Linda was the same . He 'd never really thought so . Melody finally dried her eyes and said : " I 'm sorry . I 'm not behavingvery well this morning . I 'm ill . It 's that stew , I 'm so sick and tired of it I could scream . " " Maybe Rufus will catch us another pig , " said Jim . The wild pigs were extremely elusive , but it had happened once ; the dog had killed a pig and they had skewered and roasted it . " If I 'd found a gun on that stupid ship I 'd go hunting for one . But let 's get back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now that you 're a fallen woman . Okay ? " " I suppose so , if you insist . But I do n't know what good talking about it 's going to do . " " It might do some good . Shall we try ? " " All right , but stop bullying me . " " I 'm only trying to help you , honey . The truth is we 've got to face two facts . One , you might have a baby . Two , your husband might divorce you , he might not be able to endure your sleeping with anotherman and bringing home that man 's child . Is this right , what I say ? " Melody slowly nodded . " Yes , it 's right . He might divorce me. "  | " All right , then you face the possibility or even the probability of having a baby all alone in the world and of then having to raise a child by yourself . " " I admit I 've worried about it , " Melody said . " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die or abandon the mother or there 's a divorce . But it would be hard . I could n't expect financial help from Charles and it would be difficult for me to support and raise a child by myself , although I 'm sure it can be done . I 'll just have to do it , that 's all . " " No , you wo n't , " said Jim . " A marriage between us on this island would certainly be a legal acknowledgment of my responsibility for any child you have as a result of your relationship with me here . It would stand up in any court in the world , honey , even if only as proof of paternity . " " Well . . . yes , as far as that goes , I think it would . " " It goes pretty far , " said Jim . " I 'm not proposing a mock marriage to you , but a marriage with a real meaning and purpose . I suggest in any event a financial agreement between us concerning any children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a good idea ? " " Yes , I suppose so , if you want to do it . " Melody seemed to have forgotten completely her headache and stomach-ache . She had crossed her legs beneath her and had folded her hands in her lap and was much calmer . The tears , no doubt , had helped . Evidently it had not occurred to her she would not be abandonedand she gazed at Jim with an absorbed interest . " All right , in the event Charles wo n't accept you and your child , assuming you have a child , then let 's say Child Support Law Number One of Providence Island will apply . Our marriage here would not be legal in the outside world , but I would have a continuing responsibility to you and your baby if your husband wo n't accept you . If he does n't , you will inform me of this and I will arrange through a lawyer to send you support for the child till it 's twenty-one . I make very good money and I 'm going to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly generous  --  let 's say eight hundred dollars a month . Also , I will name the child in my will as an equal heir with my other children and I 'll take out insurance to guarantee support if I die before the child is twenty-one . And of course I 'll pay any nursing or hospital expenses you might have in childbirth . Does this seem okay to you ? "  |p298Again  Melody gawked at him in stunned disbelief . " Eight hundred dollars a month ? " she asked . It reminded Jim of her reaction to the information that he 'd spent sixty dollars for a pair of pajamas . " Jim , that 's too much . " " No , it 's reasonable in terms of my earning power and what I supposewould be the standard of living you 'd want and expect . " " You 'd be depriving your wife and your own children . " " This would be my child too . And as for depriving my wife , she 's an heiress . Linda will inherit at least three million dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh , " said Melody , her eyes opened wide with awe at the thought of such a fortune . " It still sounds like an awful lot . " " Actually I think it should be more , perhaps a thousand . We 'll check with the lawyers and see what they say . " " No-no-no , I would n't want a thousand . Eight hundred is enough , more than enough . " " Well , we 'll make it eight hundred in the agreement , then see what the lawyers say . " Melody was awed . For a poverty-loving Christian , she had quite a thing about money and even after a month still snooped around the island looking for Morgan 's Treasure . " Eight hundred dollars a month , " she said . " That 's very generous of you , Jim . " Jim shrugged . " Not really . A court would make me pay that much in a paternity suit . " " I do n't think so . But let me ask you something . If all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you see it ? " " That 's a hard question and a hard choice , but I think it would be better for everyone concerned if I did n't . There would be the danger of you and me becoming involved again and that would n't be fair to Linda or to you either . If things do n't work out with Charles , you should be in a position to marry someone else who could be your husband and a father to your child . " " I think that 's right and sensible . But you 'd have none of the rewardsof being a father , you 'd just have to pay and pay and pay . And think of this  --  suppose I am pregnant and a boat did come this afternoon , do you know what it would cost you to have made love to me one night ? " Jim looked up at the puffs of cloud that floated over the island , multiplied to himself , and said , " About two hundred thousand dol-lars. "  | " Is n't that ridiculous ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheaper if I 'd behaved under that tree . " " It 's ridiculous for it to cost you two hundred thousand dollars to sleep with a woman once . Why , I never heard of such a price as that . " " You ca n't figure it that way . You are n't a hooker , honey . " " What ? " She did n't know the term . " Prostitute , " said Jim . " Besides , it is n't as much money as it sounds like added up . It 's only about ten thousanda year . I make much more than that and I 'll make even more . " " It 's still ridiculous for it to cost you such an amount . " " What would it cost you ? " asked Jim . " This is why we have marriage , so men will pay as much for that one night as the woman pays . Share the pleasure , share the pain , and meanwhile the human race survives in all its misery . But I doubt if a boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more for my money than one night . " Melody smiled . " You probably will . " " Maybe even twenty nights . " " That 's ten thousand dollars a night . I hope I do n't think  --  good grief , this is costing him a fortune , I 'd better kiss him right . " " You 'd kiss me right for nothing , " said Jim , " and I think you 'd better marry me while I 'm in a virtuous mood . I 'll draw up Child Support Law Number One this morning , and you and I and Florence can all sign it . I 'll make carbons so we all have a copy . I 'll also draw up Nullifying Marriage Law Number Two and we can sign that one . It will declare null and void our marriages to Linda and Charles on this island , then we can get married ourselves . " " Jim , I 'm very grateful for your offer to help me with the baby , " said Melody with a smile , " but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why is it silly ? " " Jim , it 's impossible . You ca n't just declare our marriages null and void , you do n't have the power . " " I 'm not declaring them null and void , all the people on the island are declaring them null and void , and if that is n't legal , I do n't know what is . " " It might be legal according to some modern court , I do n't know , but even if it is , what 's legal is n't everything . There 's more to marriagethan that . " " This is the second time you 've said there 's more to it than that ,  |p300and  for the second time you 're right . Of course there 's more to it . Law is only half of it  --  " " Jim , you are only trying to make me feel better and I 'm grateful , you 've been very sweet . But you do n't have to , I 'm all right . I 'll live with you here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you shut up and stop interrupting ? I am trying to talk to you about something serious and you keep interrupting me like an idiot . It 's intolerable . Will you shut your rude grasshopper mouth and listen , or do you want me to get really angry ! " It was dangerous , but she had to be sidetracked at all costs or there 'd be woe on that island . Jim glared at her in a simulation of male rage . The thing to convey was that he might strike her at any moment . " I . . . I . . . " said Melody . Once again she gaped at him with her mouth open , as if she 'd never quite seen him before . " I 'm sorry , I did n't mean to be rude ... " Great , thought Jim . Superb male rage . Of course , having made love to her was a fundamental help in taming her female temper , but he was entitled to use that edge . One thing was sure : the days of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then be quiet and listen to what I 'm trying to say to you . " " All right , I 'll listen . " " I was saying when you interrupted me that of course there 's more to marriage than a simple question of law . Law is only half of it . Marriage is concerned with moral issues as well as legal issues . There 's an intimate , even symbiotic relationship between all law and morality , but civil law and individual morality are recognizably distinct areas of the framework upon which human society is organized and constructed . " Jim was glad for once of his philosophy major and even gladder of his prep-school debating days . He was almost impressed himself , and Melody again was gawking at him . " Understand ? " " No . . . no , not exactly . " " The thing I am getting at I would call a question of ethics . You 'd call it a question of God . Okay , I do n't mind the word God . I do n't believe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're talking about the same thing whatever word we use . The point is , any law dealing with marriage should not be unethical or immoral  --  or , if you like , unacceptableto God . For this reason , marriage laws are considered in a special category by practically all civilizations . That 's why we call marriagea sacrament . "  |p301Melody  's shock at his male rage had diminished . She now had an odd little half-amused , Mona Lisa smile on her face that Jim could not quite interpret . " You call marriage a sacrament ? " Jim shrugged . " Everyone does , in a sense . " " Not everyone . The Roman Catholics and the eastern churches do , along with baptism , confirmation , the Eucharist , penance , extreme unction , and holy orders . The Protestants only recognize baptism and the Lord 's Supper . " Jim Kittering smiled to himself . Thank God he 'd had the foresight to look up " sacrament " in the dictionary when he got back to the cave from the hill that morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of organized religion , " said Jim . " Sacrament also has the broader and deeper meaning of a covenant between God and man , or a covenant between a man and his fundamental feelings of right and wrong . ' I shall not kill , even if I die myself ' is the covenant , for example , of a conscientious objector . I shall love and protect this woman and her children ' is another covenant . Marriage is a sacrament and marriage laws are in a special category , just as I said . " Melody 's chin was in her hand and she was staring at him in fascination , although the faintly amused smile was still in her eyes . Jim could not quite make it out . It was not a contemptuous or hostile smile , but it was amused . " Well , yes , " she said , " I 'll have to admit that in a broader sense you 're right . And I think I understand now what you 're trying to say . " " Tell me . ' What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand you , you are saying that a law nullifying our marriageson this island and permitting us to be married here would be not only legal , but also ethical and moral and in that sense acceptable to God . " " Yes , " said Jim . " That 's exactly what I 'm trying to say , and that 's exactly what I believe . And I think you believe it too , whether you 'll admit it or not . " Melody smiled . " You seem pretty certain of your own opinion , whatever mine might be . " " I 'm certain of my opinion , yes , but of course I may be wrong . I 'm sure there 're many people who would n't agree with me . I imagine your husband would n't and most of your friends would n't . This is the prime problem  --  what 's acceptable to God and what is n't . I can only go by my own opinion , and that 's all anyone can do . " " No , you 're forgetting we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law in the Bible . And for this very reason we ca n't just make up new laws to suit ourselves . " Jim knew very well her views on the imperfection of the Bible and felt a little triumphant tingle . " Well now , honey , " he said , " I do n't want to get in a theological argument with you , but I 'd say that even though the Bible may be in part God-inspired , I do n't think it 's finished and complete any more than I think the human race is finished and complete . When God 's law is written , Gabriel will blow his horn and we 'll all go up to heaven because our time on earth will be done . Do n't you agree ? " Melody 's little smile was gone ; she now had a look of dreamy absorption . She loved God-talk and he 'd counted on that . Nothing suited her better than a penetrating discussion on God and morals . " Yes , I do , " she answered . " I do n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The little smile returned . " But how do you know this is one of God 's laws ? " " I believe it is , " said Jim . He knew what her next question would be . Except for her enigmatic little smile , the conversation was going as he had planned and hoped . " I 'm not sure I understand completely what you mean . Are you trying to tell me belief makes a thing right ? " " Yes . " " I do n't see why that 's necessarily so . Suppose we believe somethingwicked and wrong ? " " That 's our problem . We must n't believe things that are wicked and wrong or we do n't survive . We must believe things that are right . " " But if God 's law is n't all written , how can we tell the difference ? How do we know what 's right ? " It was eerie . The only distracting factor was the little smile in her eyes . " What do we base our judgmenton , Jim ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd put it one way and you 'd put it another . I 'd say primary postulate , you 'd say faith . But however you put it , primary postulate or faith , that 's the only answer there ever was or ever will be . " " I 'm not sure I understand you exactly . I think I do . . . " It was very distracting . Jim could not make out her smile . Melody seemed amused by him and yet she was n't . " Yes , I think so , but can you give me an example of what you mean ? " " I 'll give you several , " said Jim . " How do we know God exists ?  |p303How  do we know life is worth living ? How do we know love is real ? How do we know it matters if a baby cries ? " In silence , Melody stared at him as the trade wind blew her hair . Finally she said : " Then faith or primary postulate , as you call it , would mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth living , love is real , and it matters if a baby cries . We do n't know these things ? " " Nobody knows those things , " said Jim , " but most people assume a few of them are true . " Once again Melody was silent , legs crossed beneath her and hands folded in her lap as the trade wind blew her hair . The little smile was back in her eyes . " Well , " she said , " you 're right in thinking Charles and most of our friends would n't agree with you . They would n't consider it a sacrament , Jim . They 'd consider it a sacrilege , and a dreadful one at that . A mockery of the law of both man and God . " " I do n't doubt it . Most of my own friends would consider it **25;10542;TOOLONG . " " I do n't see how they could think that , " answered Melody . " It would give me and any baby of mine more protection than anything you could do . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help me anyhow if it 's necessary , but a marriage would guarantee it . No matter what people thought about it , the baby and I would have a certain position . The father loved me and tried to marry me , even though he could n't and it was only a sacrilege . " Briefly , Jim thought of going over the argument again but rejected the idea as useless . He had done his best , but it was too much . Woe would prevail on the island , that was all , woe and adultery without end . " Yeah , I tried , " he said . " I sure did . But I guess I ca n't ask you to do a thing you think is a sacrilege . " Melody opened her eyes in surprise . " What ? " she asked . " I do n't think it 's a sacrilege . Charles might think so , but not me . " " You do n't ? Then what do you think ? " The little enigmatic smile reappeared once more in Melody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a sacrament . I think if we promised to love each other as man and wife on this island it would be a real marriage . " " Then you will marry me here ? " " Yes , I will , " said Melody . " You will ? " " Yes . When would you like the wedding to be ? "  | " The sooner the better . How about this afternoon ? " " All right . " " I think a simple , dignified ceremony , " said Jim . " Nothing elabo-rate . " " No , simple . " Jim took her hand and helped her to her feet . He still could not quite believe it and was half afraid she might change her mind . " We 'll have to get ready . I 'll have to write those laws and also a ceremony for Florence , and you 'll have to find a suitable dress . " " Yes , I will have to find some sort of dress . " Melody smiled again as she put her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't you think you ought to kiss me ? " Jim kissed her lightly on the lips . " Anything but that pale gray dress  --  you know , the one we left in the coconut grove last night . That one is n't suitable . It ought to be a white dress . A long , white dress . " " I 'll see what I can do , " said Melody , with still another baffling little smile . " You look like Mona Lisa in tortoise-shell glasses , " said Jim . " Why are you smiling at me like that ? " " No reason . " " Hmmph , " said Jim , puzzled . " Must be some reason . What are you thinking ? " " I probably should n't say it , but I was just wondering if your wife understands you . " " What on earth made you wonder that ? " " I do n't know . It always surprises me about you , but at heart you 're very old-fashioned . " Jim smiled . Little did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " only too well . " " I hope she does , " answered Melody . " But you 're a very deceiving man , or maybe I should say deceptive . There 's quite a distance betweenwhat you think you think and what you really think . I agree with Florence about that . " A triumph , thought Jim , as he put his arms around Melody and his cheek against hers . He had handled her perfectly , she had bought this slightly ridiculous marriage with no reservations at all . A silent " Whew ! " came from him and he lifted his eyes ironically heavenward when she could no longer see his face . A triumph of Thespian art ,  |p305that  was what it was . What a performance ! He 'd even managed subtly to persuade her he was " old-fashioned "  --  a stroke of sheer genius , that , the dramatic art carried to its ultimate . He had given , Jim felt , a masterly performance . To Jim 's and Melody 's surprise , Florence seemed overjoyed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of , " she said . " I love weddings anyhow , but a wedding under these conditions is just too great to think of . " As discussion of arrangements continued , Florence 's enthusiasm did not diminish . " Let 's get this straight , " she said . " Jim will be standing in place and I will be off to the side with the accordion . You 'll have to be out of sight somewhere , Melody , behind a bush or something . Then when I start to play the Wedding March , ' you will come forward and take your place by Jim and I will step around in front of you and marry you . " " Maybe I ought to play the Wedding March ' myself , " said Melody . " You really do n't play it very well , Florence . " " Melody , you ca n't play the music at your own wedding , " said Jim . " You 're the bride , that would n't make any sense at all . " " Do n't worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice all morning . You can correct me and give me a lesson while you work on your wedding dress . " " All right , but you 'll have to practice hard , Florence . I do n't want it to sound silly , this wedding is unusual enough already . " " I 'll practice hard , do n't worry , I can learn it , " said Florence . " But I ca n't learn the ceremony too  --  especially if it 's going to be some new , different ceremony nobody heard of . " " You can read the ceremony , Florence , " said Jim . " I 'm going to write it this morning and I 'll make a neat copy so you can read it . " " This is awful , " said Melody , who was in the midst of an anxious search through the dresses of her closet , which consisted of a stretched wire in the corner of her bedroom . She had already emptied both of her suitcases on the mattress-pallet . " Just awful . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitable . " " It 'll have to be that white dress , " said Florence . " I know , but it does n't look like a wedding dress at all . " " You can adapt it . Sew some frills on it or something . " " I do n't know , but I 'll have to try . " " Florence , where 'd you put your typewriter ? " asked Jim.  | " On the crates of grapefruit juice under a towel , " said Florence as she took down the ebonite and mother-of-pearl accordion from a railroadspike driven into a fissure in the wall . " You 're always hiding it , " said Jim . " I ought to throw it away and go to the Klondike and live with the Eskimos , " said Florence . " That typewriter eats the meat right off my bones . The Eskimos would fuck me and fatten me up . " Jim winced , but Melody was in the bedroom burrowing at the bottomof one of her suitcases and had not heard the remark . Florence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shy and hypersensitivewoman , her language could be pretty rough at times . Surreptitiously , Jim glanced under and around his shoulder at Florence , but she was in a bland good humor . And thank God for that . Apparently , while he and Melody were working out their immediate destiny with God-talk in a trade wind , Florence had found some kind of answer to her own problem . Her dither of nerves was gone and she seemed genuinely pleased by the wedding . Her first reaction had been astonished disbelief , but then she had laughed almost hysterically and put her hand on Jim 's arm and said : " You 're going to make an honest woman out of her  --  beautiful ! " She had then actually put her arm for a moment around his waist and said : " You always surprise me . This is one I would n't have thought you were capable of . " An intricate girl , Florence , thought Jim as he found the portable typewriter under the towel . Putting her arm around him like that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in moments of emotion . Jim placed the typewriter on a blanket-covered case of Dinty Moore beef stew . " Before you start practicing , Florence , and before you get involved with that dress , Melody , let 's decide where we 're going to have this wedding . Does anyone have any ideas ? " " Well , " said Florence , " I know the island better than either of you , and I 'd say the best place is down at the southern end . It 's very beautiful . There 's a level area of rock , the waves are very big , and the wind makes a haunting musical sound as it blows through the . . . rock formation . . . the , er , channel there . " Jim shook his head . " Melody wo n't go for that , not in this cen-tury . " " I sure wo n't , " said Melody as she held out her white dress and stared dubiously at it . " I 'm not getting married in any place with a name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Melody . What difference does it make what name it 's called ? " " What difference ? You would n't even mention the name out loud yourself , that 's the difference . " " Let 's change the name then . Let 's call it Morgan 's Blowhole or Morgan 's Pipe or something . " " I 'll always think of it by that other name , " said Melody . " Besides , it makes a funny noise . I 'm not getting married anywhere with a thing making a noise like that . " " I agree with you it 's a beautiful spot , Florence , " said Jim , " but it 's a bad idea . Think of some other place . " " Umm . . . The Elysian Field ? " " No , we got engaged there , " said Melody . " We ought to get marriedsomewhere else . " " All right , how about Hell 's Half Acre out on the point there ? That 's even more dramatic . " " She does n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she does n't , " said Melody , " or the place either  --  all those horriblelizards and things . " " Well , let 's see . . . how about Melody 's Bathtub up at the north end of the island ? " " I do n't want to get married someplace where I wash my back , " said Melody . " That 's a terrible idea , Florence . " " Okay , I 've got another thought . A great thought . The horse-shoe cove under the Hanging Tree . That 's beautiful , perfect . " " I do n't think so , " said Jim . " I do n't either , " said Melody . " What 's wrong with it ? It 's lovely under the tree there . " " Florence , that 's not a good idea , " said Jim . " Hanging Tree , what a place to get married . You keep getting one bad idea after the other . Melody wants a nice place to get married and so do I. " " I suggested the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the beach across from the wreck ? " " No , I do n't want to look at a wreck while I 'm getting married . " " Okay , the coconut-palm grove back behind the beach . You would n't be able to see the wreck from there . " " No , but it 's too closed in , " said Melody . " We would n't see anything else either , except coconut palms . " " All right , how about the cave itself , right here ? " " No , that 's even more closed in. "  | " Then I give up . There 's no place else on the island , I 've covered everything . " Melody was frowning at her white dress . " Well , " she said , " I do have Charles 's mother 's lace tablecloth . You remember , Jim , it was in the top part of the trunk and did n't get wet ? " " Yes , " said Jim . " Think of some other place , Florence . We 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tablecloth and add it as a sort of fringe to lengthen the dress , " said Melody , " and wear the rest as a shawl , a kind of  --  what do they call it , mantilla or mantillo ? " Florence laughed and shook her head . " Mantilla is the word you want . Mantillo means manure . " " Good grief , and I 'm supposed to have studied Spanish . But I could cut up the tablecloth . Of course Charles 's mother would whirl in her grave . " " Think of a place , Florence , " said Jim . " The best place by far is the first one I suggested . Morgan 's , excuse me , Asshole . And I really think , Melody , it 's high time you got over your squeamishness . You were a nurse in a hospital , you must have seen assholes before , what are you scared of ? " " I 'm not scared . Who 's scared ? That 's silly , Florence . " " You 're letting a name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonsensical . I think you ought to conquer your squeamishness and prudery and get married there . " " Get married there yourself , " said Melody . " Me ? I 'm never going to get married anywhere . I 'm not the marryingkind , but you are and you ought to get over your prudery . It 's ridiculous . " " Get over my prudery , " said Melody . " I 'm tired of being accused of that . You 're both more prudish than I am , by far . " " That 's an original idea . Did you hear her , Jim ? We 're both more prudish than she is . Did you hear that ? " " Yes , I heard it . But you can stop arguing , I 've thought of the place for the wedding . The ideal and perfect place , in fact the only place . Right above our heads . " Thus , at four o'clock that afternoon Jim stood on Morgan 's Pillow on top of the Jungfrau in his best suit , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rufus , who had gone along with them , became agitated as Florence gave a preliminary squeeze at the accordion and caused it to make a wheezing groan . " Woof ! " said thep309dog . " Woof , woof ! " Jim stared emptily as the dog ran forward , stopped , hunched over , and barked again as if to say : " There are strange unnatural things going on here and I do n't like it . " To his surprise , Jim felt a bit trembly at the knees . That was peculiar , he felt almost as he had felt when he married Linda . Well , it was a marriage of a kind . As Melody herself had pointed out , it could cost him close to a quarter of a million dollars and if that was n't a marriage it was certainlyan involvement . But Jim felt a gathering nervousness that had nothing to do with any financial commitment and this surprised him . The sight of Melody in her improvised wedding dress with the lace tablecloth fringe had given the whole thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was something real about it . " Are you ready , Melody ? " called Florence . A voice came from behind a clump of shrubbery at the edge of the hilltop : " Yes , I 'm ready . " " Okay , here goes . " Rufus began to bark again as Florence 's fingers moved uncertainly on the keyboard of the accordion . " Shut up , Rufus . Wait a second , Melody . " The dog jumped back , hunched over with his head low to the rock of Morgan 's Pillow , and barked as Florencewagged a scolding finger at him . " Sit , Rufus ! Sit ! " " Maybe you better send him home , " said Jim . " He wo n't go . But he 's sitting now , he 's all right . Okay , Melody , here we go again . " Florence 's fingers moved and with a thin wheeze the accordion began to make a noise that sounded more or less like " Here Comes the Bride . " Jim gulped nervously as Melody appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward him in her white dress with the lace fringe . She 'd taken off her glasses and held a dozen wild flowers in her hands . Jim anxiously looked down at Rufus ; the dog again was barking , head scrunched low to the rock and shoulders humped as if to make a mock charge at Florence . He 'd never bite her , the dog adored Florence , but he might make a mock charge at her ; the accordion bothered him , and no wonder  --  Florence was making numerous errors . Jim ground his teeth in exasperation . The dog and Florence were ruining everything , the wedding was a mess . Jim looked up as Melody took her place by his side and was startled to see a smile on her face . How could she smile like that when Florence and the dog had made everything ridiculous , and what was Florence sniffling about ? " I 'm sorry , weddings always make me cry , " said Florence , " and thisp310one especially gets me . " She put down the accordion and walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " It is n't a script , it 's the words of the ceremony , " said Jim . He took the typewritten page from his breast pocket and handed it to her . " All right , " said Florence . " Will you join hands , please ? " Jim took Melody 's hand and faced Florence , who cleared her throat , then read in a grave tone : " We are met here to join together as man and wife you , James , and you , Melody . However , the circumstances of this marriage are exceptionalin that you , James , and you , Melody , are already married to someone else . Therefore , this community , consisting of the entire population of this island , has debated , voted upon , and duly enacted two laws in response to this situation : Child Support Law Number One and Nullifying Marriage Law Number Two . Do you agree that these documents together shall constitute your marriage license for this wedding ? " " Yes , I agree , " said Jim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dearly beloved , we are gathered here today in the sight of God to join together in holy matrimony you , James , and you , Melody . Matrimonyis an honorable estate instituted of God and a shrewd if not always successful attempt by man to insure the perpetuation of the human species and to fulfill the deepest longings for love and companionshipto be found in the human heart . Thus , I require and charge you both , as you will answer at the dreadful day of judgment when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed , that if either of you knows of any impediment why you may not lawfully and in true love be joined together , you do now confess it , for be well assured that if any persons are joined together otherwise than as God 's law and man 's conscience doth allow , their marriage is not lawful and will bring neither fulfillment nor joy . " " Well , I 'm married in New York , " said Jim , " but I 'm not married here , according to the laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outside world too , " said Melody , " but I 'm not married here , according to this island 's laws . " " There is no impediment , " said Florence . " Will you , Jim , have this woman to be your wedded wife on this island ? Will you love her , be kind to her , respectful to her , and keep her in sickness and in health for so long as you both shall live on this island ? " " I will , " said Jim.  | " Will you , Melody , have this man to be your wedded husband on this island ? Will you love him , be kind to him , respectful to him , and keep him in sickness and in health for so long as you both shall live on this island ? " " I will , " said Melody . " Those whom God hath joined together let no man put asunder ... on this island . In the authority vested in me by law , I now pronounce you man and wife on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand and scratch his chin . The ceremony , he felt , had been perhaps a bit too simple . Of course he 'd spent most of his time writing the two laws , which were much more complicated and in a way much more important . The ceremony did cover the fundamentals , anyhow . " You may kiss the bride , " said Florence , " if you want to . " " I hope he wants to , " said Melody with a smile . " Give me my glasses , Florence , so I can see him . " Melody put on her glasses , opened her arms , smiled again , and Jim embraced and kissed her . " A lovely wedding , " said Florence , " just lovely . A beautiful bride and a handsome groom , and as far as I 'm concerned you 've got nothing to worry about when the dreadful day of judgment comes . " " It comes every day if you ask me , " said Jim , who felt badly let down . " You really do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I had a camera , I 'd take a picture of your smile and keep it always . " " We love you too , Jim and me both , " said Melody as she put her arms around Florence and accepted a kiss on the cheek . " Well , I am going for my usual sunset walk with Rufus and I 'll be back around seven , " said Florence . " Congratulations to you both . " With a feeling of dismal anticlimax , Jim watched Florence walk off down the hill with her dog . It was true Melody had smiled , but she was not smiling now and the whole thing was a ridiculous fiasco from barking dog to the lace-tablecloth wedding dress . He had thought it would help her , reassure her , encourage her , make her feel less guilty and miserable , make her feel that he really cared about her , but it had fallen flat . She was ashamed , depressed , she could not look him in the eye . Even Florence , who had gallantly tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been embarrassed and anxious to get off that hill . " I guess we better go back to the cave and get out of these . .  |p312clothes  , " said Jim . " I mean ... out of these wedding clothes and into normal clothes . " " Yes , " said Melody , head bowed . " I suppose so . " How do you win ? Jim wondered . They did not speak going down the Jungfrau and reached the cave at quarter past four . Unbelievably , the wedding had taken only fifteen minutes . " Florence moved her things to your bedroom , " said Melody . " I know . " Eyes averted from each other , Jim and Melody walked into the larger of the two bedrooms and then , at a total loss , stood there between the two mattresses on the stone floor . " I thought of asking Florence to read that quotation from the gist Psalm , " said Melody . " You know , He shall give his angels charge over thee . ' She ca n't last long and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very sweet , I admired her so much . " Unsure of what to do , Jim took off his necktie . " How could that have made her feel better ? And what do you mean , she ca n't last long ? " " She 's so alone . She 's very brave , Jim . I ca n't tell you how much I admire and love her . " " I like Florence too . But I do n't understand what you mean about the gist Psalm . That quotation has meaning for us , I know , but .. . Florence ? " " If it has meaning for us , it would have meaning for her too , would n't it ? " Still unsure of what to do , Jim took off his jacket and put it on a hanger and hung it on the stretched wire . " I 'm not sure I know what you 're talking about , " he said . " I 'm not sure either . " Melody pulled the blanket partition shut and slid her makeshift wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , then unfastened her brassiere and took it off . " It just seemed pathetic to me when she said she 'd be gone till seven . That 's almost three hours . Ordinarily her sunset walk takes an hour . " " I guess she thinks ... " " Yes , I guess she does , " said Melody . " I 'm afraid she does n't know much about anything . It was pathetic . " " Well , I 'm sympathetic to Florence , but ... let 's talk about something else . " Melody sat on her mattress-pallet in her panties . " Jim , I 've had ap313very hard day . One of the hardest days I 've ever had in my life . I still have a kind of headache and my stomach hurts . Would you mind if I did n't talk at all ? I 'm exhausted and I want to lie down and sleep . I 've wanted all day to lie clown and sleep . May I lie clown and sleep ? " " Why , sure , honey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? In bewilderment , Jim watched her lie down on her back and put her arm across her eyes . She seemed actually to want to go to sleep , but if so , why the tone of reproach in her voice and why had she taken off her brassiere ? Jim , who had seen several snapshots of Charles , suddenly had a mental picture of a solemn-eyed , tight-lipped , rather handsome and kind-looking man in rimless spectacles . Melody was mixing him up with Charles , a natural enough thing to do since what did she know about men ? Hesitantly , Jim walked over and stood beside her . " I 'm tired myself , " he said . " It 's been a nerve-wracking day for everybody . Do you mind if I lie down too ? " Melody did n't reply . Jim undressedand sat beside her on the mattress and pulled her arm from her eyes . As he had expected , she was crying . Jim put his left hand between her breasts , slid his right arm under her and lay beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Do you want me to make love to you ? " In surprise , she turned her head toward him . " I 've wanted you to all day , " she said , " but how can you ? It was only last night . " Melody had been startled the night before when Jim had made love to her a second time , and she 'd been amazed the third time . " How are you able ? " she asked . Charles , she said , had made love to her twice on two or three occasions during the early months of their marriage , but afterward had complained of extreme fatigue and debilitation . It was his view as a medical doctor that such excesses were a severe strain on the heart , the lungs , the circulation , and most of all the human nervous system  --  particularly insofar as men were concerned ; women , of course , who had a much feebler reaction , were not so seriously affected . It did not drain them the way it did men . Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a man could go through medicalschool and believe such things , but he seemed to remember having read somewhere an article deploring the extreme ignorance and naiveteof many medical doctors in this area of human life . " Can I ? " asked Jim with a smile . " I might be able to manage . " " But you must n't tire yourself all out just because of me , " said Melody . " I 'm all right , really , I can just go on to sleep . "  | " Go to sleep ? " asked Jim . " Now ? We just got married , honey , do n't you remember ? " Melody smiled , then took off her glasses and stared at him , a shynessin her eyes . She always looked very shy , very gentle without her glasses . She 'd looked that way when she came walking toward him across Morgan 's Pillow in her white dress with the lace fringe from Charles 's mother 's tablecloth . " Yes , I remember it , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his elbows and put his hands on her breasts , which amply filled his palms . It baffled him now to remember he had always considered full breasts a bit lacking in true elegance and feminine appeal . In recent weeks he had reversed this superficial judgment . The soft mounds beneath his hands were sublimely beautiful , and so was Melody herself and everything about her . If only he could make her happy ... . " Are you sorry ? " asked Jim . " Do you regret it , honey ? " " Let 's do n't talk , " she answered . " Just ... kiss me . " Florence did n't come back until eight-thirty . It was dark and Jim was half asleep in Melody 's arms when he heard her talking to Rufus outside the cave . He propped on an elbow , struck a match , and lighted a kerosene lantern . " Florence is back , " he said . Melody put her arms around him , pulled him down to her , kissed him , and whispered : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much ! Sleep in my arms tonight ... just sleep in my arms . " Jim propped again on an elbow and stared down into her eyes . It was not passion that moved her . He had won , after all . A real inspirationhad come to him on top of old Jungfrau in the pearly dawn . Florence lasted about three weeks . Jim sensed at once her helpless , abject , and pathetic surrender but he was happy with Melody and reluctant to face the problem . A rather interesting accident involving Florence and Rufus and an iguana gave him the emotional impetus to come to terms with the situation , which he felt in his heart he shouldp315have done much sooner . However , there was in Florence , as she herselfsaid , a certain amount of " bile " that needed time to be boiled out of her . The iguana , in Jim 's opinion , was a convenient but meretricious dramatization of the thing for Florence , for Melody , and for him . Florence often had spoken of " me and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as filled with " iguana bile . " She had even once told Jim point-blank he ought to dip her in boiling water and induce her to vomit her poison , as the Indians reputedly did to iguanas in Mexico . This , she said , would purge her and make her taste like chicken . Jim , who already had a chicken on his hands and regardedFlorence as a tough bird at best , smiled and looked the other way as he had done on other occasions when Florence made her little jokes about thirty-eight-year-old cobwebs , merciful chloroform , and other esoterica . However , although he did not want to face the onerous problem , it was as if he were waiting for some little thing . He had noticed for several days peculiar behavior on Melody 's part , a certain odd , nervous agitation and a tendency to wool-gather , plus a rather puzzling inconsistencyin her reactions to him sexually . Her period was due soon and he had marked it up to premenstrual tension . It was a plausible answer , but he knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some little thing , almost any little thing  --  a stammer , an averted gaze , a hesitant reply , or even an irrelevant upset of some kind that would start the adrenals working . A few days short of four weeks after the wedding , Jim was repairing a broken deck chair one morning when Melody suddenly appeared out of breath in the entrance of the cave , her hair wet and her eyes wide with alarm . " Jim ! " she cried . " Florence is in trouble ! " " Trouble ? What kind of trouble ? " " She 's caught in a hole in the ground somewhere on the Matterhorn ! I can hear her , but I ca n't tell where she is ! You 'd better come right away ! " " What do you mean , caught in a hole in the ground ? " asked Jim with indignation . The very idea was outrageous . Had n't he had enough trouble with Melody on that island , without Florence foolishly getting caught in a hole in the ground ? She 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right . Now , you calm down , Melody , and explain what you mean about Florence in English . "  | " I mean she 's caught , Jim , she 's trapped ! It 's somewhere underground ! I can hear her calling and Rufus is down there too , barking . Jim , you 'd better hurry . I think she 's all right , but she 's frightened and wherever she is , she ca n't get out . " Jim had not shaved that morning ; he sometimes put it off , because although he 'd found plenty of razor blades on the ship he 'd run out of shaving lather and it was unpleasant to shave with soap . Half puzzled and half indignant , he rubbed at his sandpaper-like chin and narrowed his eyes in pensive cogitation . Again , quite apart from her concern about Florence caught in some mysterious subterranean trap , there was an odd nervous agitation in Melody 's manner . For some strange reason , she was having difficulty looking him in the eye . " A hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , I 'd better get a rope . " " I was coming back from my bath and I heard her . It was up on the hill somewhere and I could n't find her . I ... I thought I ought to come get you . " " Um-hmm , " said Jim . It was pretty early in the morning to be taking a bath , but Melody recently had been taking quite a few baths , or so she said , and she certainly smelled of soap . On the clay before , she had taken three baths , and on the day before that , two . Why this sudden fetish for cleanliness and why could she not look him in the eye ? " You had another bath , huh ? I thought you and Florence were going for a walk . " " Well ... no . I decided not to . " Jim took down a coiled length of nylon rope and slung it over his arm . Melody and Florence had been going for frequent walks lately . The odd thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matterhorn he could not see them . Where did they go ? Practically all of the island was visible from Morgan 's Armchair . Of course , it was impossible to see the little cove under the cliff or into the coconut palm grove or on the other side of the Jungfrau . That was probably where they were , on the other side of the Jungfrau , but what were they doing there for two , three hours ? " You decided not to go with her today , huh ? " " Yes , I ... I thought I 'd take a bath . " " Where do you go on these walks with Florence , honey ? " " Jim , we ca n't talk now , she 's caught underground someplace . " " Yes , but where do you go ? " " Nowhere in particular . Please , you 'd better hurry  --  she 's frightened and says she hurt her knee . "  | " You talked to her ? " " Yes , I could hear her but I could n't tell where she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had a bad case of it . Her nervous agitation and abstracted manner were quite strange . Even now , in the midst of genuine alarm and concern about Florence , she had a wool-gathering look about her , as if some murky and absorbing thing was on her mind . As he walked with her down the Jungfrau and across the meadow toward the Matterhorn , Jim wondered about it and the more he wondered about it , the more worried he became . It was strange . Three days before , Melody had rejected advances on his part after making advances herself . She had been very abstracted during dinner and even more so after dinner ; then , when Florence left with a kerosene lantern to go to the latrine around ten-thirty , she had become quite nervous and agitated and suddenly got up and came and sat in his lap and kissed him passionately three or four times . Later that night , when they 'd gone to bed , she again kissed him passionatelybut then pushed him in the chest and said she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jim did n't like it and he did n't understand it either . Melody was always receptive , she was never " too tired , " and her self-consciousness was equally unconvincing . It was true , in the beginning they 'd both been inhibited by Florence 's presence in the cave . They had made love in the afternoons or waited until late at night when they could convincethemselves Florence was asleep . They also tried at first to be silent as a mouse about it , but in the normal course of events this inhibition had gradually broken down . Why pretend ?  --  and why be ashamed , what difference did it make anyhow ? None , really . A week or so after the wedding they got carried away one night and forgot to be quiet and the next day Florence laughed about it , made a joke , said she was surprised they both could walk . After that , although they still tried to be reasonably quiet and not make a gross exhibition of themselves , Jim and Melody had made love any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear their or not . Why pretend , indeed ? She knew what they were doing and it did n't matter if she heard an occasional kiss or heavy sigh or even more disturbing sounds , because it did n't really bother Florence , she was amused . Yeah , thought Jim as he climbed the cactus-covered Matterhorn with a nervous , agitated , wool-gathering Melody . What a notion !  |p318How  on earth could Florence be amused ? How could she or any other person find it funny to lie alone in bed and listen to other people in the throes of love six feet away on the other side of a flimsy blanket ? Would n't she be tantalized beyond measure , aroused to unbearable desire , and , in short , driven half crazy if she were any kind of normal person at all ? Of course she would , and it was a thing he had feared from the very beginning . The explanation of Melody 's nervousness and wool-gathering could not be more obvious . Halfway up the Matterhorn , Jim stopped and turned to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Okay , " he said , " how long have you and Florence been doing funny things to each other ? The last three days or is it longer than that ? " " What ? " asked Melody . " What did you say ? " " Or is she merely doing funny things to you ? Is that the trouble , Melody ? Is that why you 're acting so strange ? " " I 'm not acting strange and I do n't know what you 're talking about . " " You are acting strange and so is Florence . " And that was certainly true . Florence had been acting just as strangely as Melody but in a different way . Whereas Melody was gripped by a nervous agitation , Florence exuded a spooky calm . She lay around the cave in a languorous manner , sprawled on the deck chairs as if under tranquillizers . At the same time , like a child who steals cookies and is terrified of getting caught , there was a mixture of sly defiance and fear in her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid of you , I can handle you any time  --  but for God 's sake do n't spank me because I ca n't bear pain ! " The two women had indulged in some kind of " unnatural behavior , " and Melody , to judge from her reaction , had responded to it to some degree . So Jim believed , but she seemed genuinely staggered by his accusation and he was not quite sure . " Well , Melody ? Is n't it true ? You 're both acting very strange , what else could it be ? " Melody slowly shook her head in disbelief . " Jim , this is the craziest idea you 've had since we 've been on the island . What on earth could possess me to do funny things ' with Florence ? What kind of a woman do you think I am ? Even if you could think it of Florence , how could you think it of me , when you sleep with me and know how I feel about you ? What in the world put such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Jim , his confidence shaken . Could he have had a minor attack of paranoia ? There was not a whit or a trace of guilt in Melody 's gaze , not even a microscopic particle . If anything actually had happened between her and Florence , surely she 'd never be able to look him calmly in the eye and deny it . Ile must be mistaken . Something was going on between them , all right , but it was on a psychological rather than a physical level . And yet , at times Melody could be an awful liar . He had often been amused by her ability to look him in the eye with the innocence of a child and tell an absolute flat lie . The situation , Jim decided , would bear further investigation . " Now , let me repeat , " said Melody . " While you 're imagining ridiculousthings , Florence is caught down in some hole in the ground . She 's hurt her knee and she 's frightened . Do n't you think you ought to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . And I 'm sorry if I offended you , because I do n't really feel that  --  " " You can apologize later . Let 's help Florence now . " Two-thirds up the Matterhorn , Jim heard Rufus barking . The sound was distant and remote and seemed weirdly to come not only from underground but from several directions at once , both from out over the cliff and from somewhere under the earth . The hill was more rugged than the Jungfrau and steep on all sides except the western slope to the meadow . The eastern face was an actual cliff so steep as to be unscalable except by an expert with equipment ; this was the rocky cliff that loomed over the little horseshoe cove and the " HangingTree of Life , " which grew near its base on a raised elevation back from the thin strip of beach . " She and the dog are down in the ground somewhere , " said Jim . " But I do n't understand it , the noise is also coming from over the cliff . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Melody . " That 's what puzzled me too . " " Florence ? Can you hear me ? Where are you ? " A remote voice called back : " Jim ? Is that you ? " " Yes , it 's me , where are you ? " " I 'm down here , get me outl " " Where the hell is down here ? " " I 'm in a sort of little cave ! I fell in and hurt my knee  --  not bad , but get me out ! "  | " How can I get you out when I do n't know where you are ? " " Maybe it 's under one of the bushes , " said Melody . " The whole thing is bushes . Which bush ? " " Look for a crack in the rock ! " called Florence . " Not very wide . It 's hidden by a bush . " " We know that , but which bush ? " " A low one that 's spread all over . " Jim folded his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill was covered with various kinds of cactus plants and low-spreading , dense-foliaged shrubbery . " They 're all low and spread all over , " he called . " Sing something and I 'll try and follow the sound . " " What 'll I sing ? " " Oh , Christ , I do n't care what you sing . Sing anything . " Florence began to yodel . " Yo-dee-lay-dee-hoo , yo-dee-lay-dee-boo , boo boo boo ... " " It 's this way , I think , " said Jim . With difficulty he picked his way through cacti and leg-grabbing dense bushes that formed a nearcontinuousmat rising in green waves one to three feet above the ground . The sound of Florence 's voice and Rufus ' barking became louder . " Keep singing , Florence . " " Ouch ! " cried Melody as a cactus thom caught her on the leg . " I ca n't walk through this . " " Wait there , " said Jim . " Keep yodeling , Florence , I think I 'm gettinghot . " " YO-DEE-LAY-DEE-HOO ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Jim still could not see any crack or opening in the rock . " This beats me , " he said . " I wonder if that stupid bush over there ... " A low-growing , thickleavedbush grew in a slight bowl-shaped recess eight feet away , protectedin every direction except to the cliffside by prickly cactus . The edge of the precipice could not be too many feet away ; he could see over the rising wave of jungle-like foliage a part of the lagoon glimmeringgreen down below . " How in hell did she ever get in here ? Ouch ! Damned cactus ! " " YO-DEE-LAY-DEE-HOO . . . HOo HOO HOo ! " sang Florence . Her voice was directly below him and unmistakably coming through the low-spreading dense bush , although Jim also could hear it coming from over the edge of the cliff . Taking care not to get stuck with cactus thorns , he bent down and pushed aside the leaves ofp321the bush but could see nothing . " Good God , " said Jim , " I never heard of cactuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of its mind . " " You are right above me , " said Florence . " I think I can see your shadow through the leaves . " Jim got down on his hands and knees and crawled out over the matlike bush itself , which reminded him of the altitude-starved and wind-runted foot-high birches on top of Mt . Mansfield in Vermont . The birches were more solid , however . In desperation , Jim grabbed at a gnarled root as he felt himself begin to fall . " Holy cow ! This is the most concealed damn thing I ever heard of . I almost fell in it before I could see it . " " I can see your foot now , " said Florence . Jim also could see Florence . The mystery was explained . The spreading bush , which in turn was guarded by dense cactus plants , had grown over a fissure in the rock of the hill , an opening that apparentlywent all the way through from the western slope to the eastern face of the cliff . By pushing aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chamber about ten feet below . Florence sat on a benchlike ledge with her legs crossed and a sheepish expression on her face . Rufus stood beside her , head lifted to look up at Jim and his tail wagging . " Hi , " said Florence . " Sorry to be so much bother . " " No trouble at all , " said Jim . " I tried , but I could n't climb out of here . " " Did you find her ? " called Melody . " Yeah , I found her , " said Jim . " I just have to tie the rope to the roots of this bush , then I 'll go down and get her . " " Can I help ? " " No , stay back , there 's too much cactus . I 'll get her out in a few minutes , she 's all right . " " A little shook , " said Florence , " that 's all . I 'm really sorry , it 's idiotic . The dog chased an iguana and both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but could n't find him , then before I knew it I fell in the place myself . It 's lucky I did n't break my neck . " " I 'll get you out , " said Jim , " no harm done . " He tied another knot in the rope , pulled at it hard to test it , then dropped the coil through the thirty-inch fissure . " It 's a great little cave , " said Florence , " if you could call it a cave.  |p322It  's really just a rock formation in the cliff face . But wait 'll you see it . It has a fantastic picture window right on the lagoon . " " I 'm coming down , " said Jim . He put his feet into the fissure , then lowered himself hand over hand on the rope down into the small chamber . " Welcome to Morgan 's Second Treasure Cave , " said Florence with a grin . " I have n't found much gold yet but it has its points . " Jim looked around . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iguana on the floor . There was not much blood , but a pool of greenish-yellow stain was on the floor by the creature 's mouth and the things only vomited bile in their death throes . " Is that thing dead , Florence ? " " Oh , yes , very dead . When Rufus kills something , he kills it . He bit half its stomach out . " " It 's a nasty-looking thing , " said Jim . " I wonder how sick we 've got to get of beef stew before we break down and eat one . " " Ugggch , " said Florence . " They say they 're good . You boil them . Maybe we 'll eat this one . " " Well ... I 'm game , if you are , " said Florence . " Yeah , maybe we 'll eat it . " Jim lifted his gaze from the dead lizard and looked around the little chamber . At once he understood why Florence had call it " a great little cave . " The room had a level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird droppings , and the ceiling was a vaulted , irregular mass of water-stained and mossy stone that lifted up to the fissure ; but the floor was dry and so was the shelflike ledge at the back . The place , Jim thought , was coziness personified . It was a perfect natural shelter and the hiddenness of it gave it a primeval charm . But the most striking feature of Morgan 's SecondTreasure Cave was an opening the size of a ranch-house picture window that looked directly over the lagoon . The " window " was raised eighteen inches or so from the floor , which would prevent a restless sleeper  --  the floor was about the size of a king-size bed  --  from rolling over and falling down into the top of the big tree in the cove . " This is a fantastic place , " said Jim . " It 's an agoraphobe 's dream  --  with a view . " " I told you it 's great . Rufus has done it again . He 's a thinking dog  --  although both of us felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of here . " " Melody came by and heard you ? "  | " Yes . She had gone to take a bath . " " She 's taking a lot of baths these days . " " She likes it up there . " " I 'm surprised she could hear you . The path from Melody 's Bathtubdoes n't go by here . This is pretty near the top of the hill , Flor-ence . " " Well ... the path is n't that far . " " I could n't hear you till we were way up the hill . " " I suppose she was looking for me . We 'd intended to go for a walk , she knew I was here on the hill somewhere . " " Um-hmm , " said Jim . He looked around again at the little chamberin the face of the cliff . " One thing puzzles me . Why ca n't we see that window opening from the beach ? I 've never noticed it . Have you ? " " I think the tree blocks it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . You 'd have to go out in the ocean beyond the reef to see it . From the lagoon it is n't visible . " " We can see out of it , though , " said Jim . " Maybe it 's the angle of the cliff . Oh course , it 's an overhang and it 's in shadow most of the day . " " I think that 's it . We 'd never have known it was here if Rufus and I had n't fallen in it . " " That is for sure , " said Jim . " It 's lucky Melody came looking for you . " Yes . It 's a great little place , though , a real hideout . I think I 'll take a sleeping bag or pallet and some books and come here and read . You know , relax and everything , away from it all . " " The madding crowd , " said Jim . Florence smiled uneasily . She did not seem to like the meditative way Jim was staring at her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not quite yet , " said Jim . He walked to Florence and stood over her , hands on hips . " Okay , Florence , what 's going on between you and Melody ? " " What ? What did you say ? " Her response was identical to Melody 's , but she was not as good a liar . " You heard what I said , Florence . What 's going on between you and Melody ? " " Going on ? Jim , I do n't know what you mean . Does Melody say anything is going on ? "  | " No , I asked her about it and she denied it . But she was lying and so are you right now , and that 's foolish . It 's not a thing you can keep secret from me . What 's going on ? " " Jim , there 's nothing going on . We 've taken some walks , that 's all . " Jim stared in cold annoyance at her . He felt like putting her across his knee and spanking her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Florence . Did n't you know I would find out about it ? You must have , you 're not an absolute idiot . " " Jim ... we 've just taken walks . " Despite his exasperation , Jiro could not help but feel a pity for her . As silly and pathetic as the whole thing was , Florence took it seriously as death . Her lips were apart in paralyzed fear and a pleading , don'thurt-meexpression was in her eyes . The blood had drained completely from her face and her hands were trembling . Of course she had known he would find out , she had known it quite well and now she was terrified . With a half-conscious thought of preventing her from hysterically throwing herself down over the cliff , Jim stepped between her and the window opening of the cave and said : " You 've done more than take walks , Florence . You 've been a bad girl . You 've been fiddling with Melody . " " No , Jim ... Jim , I have n't . Really I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth out of her . " Jim turned toward the rope but Florence jumped up and grabbed his arm . " Jim , wait ! Please ... do n't be angry with me . I did n't mean to . Really I did n't , I swear I did n't ! I was more surprised than she was , and it ... it ... I did n't mean to . " Jim was silent for a moment , then said , " Okay . Let 's get out of here . " " But what are you going to do ? " asked Florence , her eyes popped with worry . " Are you ... I mean , you must hate me and despise me , what are you going to do ? " " I 'm going to get out of this cave , " said Jim . " Do you have the strength to climb up the rope ? " " Oh , God ! " exclaimed Florence . Despite himself , Jim almost smiled as she raised her hands , clutched them together , and wrung them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not known Florence was capable of such a theatrical gesture . Talk about romantic  --  shewas worse than Melody . " Oh , God in heaven ! Ca n't youp325forgive me ? I 'm only human ! Do you have to hate me and despise me and look at me like that ? " Jim paused to get himself under control . Her distress was genuine and it was no time to smile . Later , perhaps , he could joke with her about it . Florence , in time , would laugh at this scene , but it was n't funny to her now . Jim stared at her in cold , stern disapproval and said : " I asked you a question . Do you have the strength in your hands to climb up this rope ? " Florence wilted as tears brimmed in her eyes . " No , I ... I do n't think so . " " Can you hold on to it if I pull you up . " Yes , I can do that . " " All right , I 'll climb it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull you up . But first tie it around Rufus and I 'll pull him out . Can you do that ? " Florence 's hands and knees were trembling and tears were running down her cheeks . " I ... no . I 'm not clever , I do n't know how to do the knots . Oh , Jim ... Jim , ca n't you forgive me ? " " I 'll make a sling for the dog and pull him up first . " By the time Jim got Rufus and Florence up into the cactus patch , Florence was sobbing uncontrollably , a hand over her eyes . Melody took one look at her and put a hand over her eyes and began to cry . It was a pathetic tableau . " All right , now stop crying , both of you , " said Jim . " That 's not going to do any good . And you 'd better take your hands down from your eyes or you 'll get stuck with cactus thorns . " Jim led Florence around through the cactus plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two women looked at each other . " Is your knee all right ? " asked Melody . " Yes , it 's just bumped a little . " " She 's lucky she was n't killed , " said Jim . " And I 'll tell you this about that place . No one would ever find it , you could live on this island twenty years and never know it was there . I do n't think you could find it even if you knew it was on the hill , unless you knew exactly and precisely where it was . " " Well , I could n't find it , " said Melody . " You really are lucky you were n't hurt , Florence , " said Jim . " That 's at least a ten-foot drop down there . "  | " All right , " said Jim . " I did n't want to go through this , but I guess we 've got to get it out in the open or you 'll brood about it for the rest of your life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few questions ? " " Yes , I think a few questions . Not because I want to know , I know already , but just to help you get it out of your system . Did she kiss you ? " " What ? " " Did Florence kiss you ? " " Jim , you do n't understand . She loves me . " " I did n't ask you if she loves you , I asked you if she kissed you . Did she ? " " Well , yes , but ... " " Did she touch your breasts ? " " Jim , how can you ask that ? " " Stop pussyfooting around , Melody . Answer me . Did she touch your breasts ? " " Nell . . . yes , but it was n't like you think . " " It 's exactly like I think . Did she put her finger in you ? " " Oh , Jim , really ! How can you ask such a thing as that ? " " Did she ? " Melody 's eyelids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blush spread in her cheeks . " Well . . . yes , she did . " " Did you do the same thing to her ? " Melody 's eyes snapped open in surprise . " Oh , no . Of course not . " Jim nodded . Melody 's surprise was genuine . It had not occurred toher as a possibility she might do the same thing to Florence . " Andwhen she did this , " asked Jim , " you responded ? " Again Melody 's eyelids fluttered shut . " Well , a little , " she said . " I could n't help it . " " All right , did you do anything else with Florence ? " " Anything else ? " " Yes , did you and Florence do any other things together ? " " No , " said Melody puzzled . " What do you mean ? " " Never mind , " said Jim . " Let 's sum up , then we can talk about our real problem . She kissed you , she touched your breasts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it to a certain extent . That 's what happened , right ? " " Yes . "
