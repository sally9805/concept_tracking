txt The success of Luna 9 demonstrates once again the strength of the Soviet thrust into space . The craft 's soft touchdown in the Ucean or Storms at 1:95 p.m. , e.s.t. , Thursday , caps many months of hard trying by Soviet space engineers . Lunas 5 , 7 , and 8 , sent moonward last year , all crashed . Luna 6 missed the moon altogether . The Soviets also failed in trying again to send a probe to Mars . In the task of mastering the very difficult techniques of deep-space missions , failure  --  even a series of failures  --  is to be expected . What is significant is the fact the Soviets have learned from their failures and have kept on trvine . Comparison hard This is the way to develop an operational capability to explore the moon and planets . It is the way the United States finally took close-up photographs of the moon after a string of failures in its Ranger program . Now the Soviets , through the same kind of persistence , have won a bigger lunar prize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back about the moon 's surface are essential for designing manned lunar landing craft . Telemetry includes , according to Tass , TV pictures from the craft as it rests on the moon 's surface . The mastery of soft-landing technique Luna 9 has demonstrated is an equally vital milepost to be passed on the road to landing men on the moon . Confirmation of the Tass report came from Jodrell Bank Observatory , in England , where signals picked up directly from Luna *Soviets kept trying until successful // 9 were fed into a facsimile machine and converted into a picture . Sir Bernard Lovell , director of the observatory , called the pictures " the most sensational pictures we have ever had at Jodrell Bank . " According to Associated Press and Reuters dispatches , individual rocks and lunar features were clearly shown . As will be the case with the American Surveyor lunar landers , the Soviets presumably used retrorockets to slow the descent of Luna 9 . Triggering such rockets at just the right moment , maintaining the craft in the right orientation during descent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a soft landing on the moon one of the most difficult space-engineering feats yet undertaken . Indeed , these difficulties have loomed so large in earth-based tests in the American Surveyor program that the program has been replanned . Originally , the first four Surveyors were to be heavily instrumented for flight testing to prove out the landing technique . Subsequent craft were to make scientific probings of the moon . In the past few months it was decided to set aside the first seven Surveyors for flight testing to make sure there is plenty of opportunity to take the bugs out of the landing maneuver . Now the first of the scientific Surveyors probably will not be launched until 1968 . That will be five years after it was originally scheduled . The first of the flight test craft now is expected to head for the moon this spring , probably sometime in May . It is difficult to compare Soviet and American space achievements to assess who 's ahead in the race for the moon . It is impossible to tell just what over-all progress the Soviets are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the light of the situation in the Surveyor program , it is obvious that the Soviets have a significant lead in developing soft-landing techniques and in finding out of what the lunar surface is made . U.S. program speeded up Meanwhile , the Soviets continue to mount an intensive satellite program . They have . sent over a hundred of the Cosmos series of satellites into orbit . Many of these are believed to have been military craft , probably spy satellites . But several dozen have been scientific satellites . They have been gathering data on the radiation belts and other aspects of the earth 's space environment in a comprehensive way . They are gathering what the Soviets themselves say is background knowledge for extended manned flights . During the past year , the United States leaped ahead in manned space flight development . It accomplished the first rendezvous between two ships and carried out the longest flights yet made . Nevertheless , this does not necessarily put them ahead of the Soviets in the lunar race . The intensive activity in launching unmanned vehicles shows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space capability . President Johnson called attention to this in his recent special message on space to the Congress .
