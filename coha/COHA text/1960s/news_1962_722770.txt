txt WASHINGTON , Nov. ** Kennedy and Chancellor Adenauer held a day-long round of meetings today that underlined the ties of their nations and revealed their differences as personalities . Their discussions about the meaning of the Cuban crisis , ! the future trend of world affairs , the problems of Berlin and ' Western defense and the fu- ' ture of Europe were apparently cordial and respectful . The atmosphere , however , was cool , reflecting what one close observer described as " the fact that these two fellows just ca n't hit it off . " The usual ceremonial speeches of welcome on the White House lawn in the morning and the toasts at luncheon indicated some of the strain . The 45-year-old President of the United States , who went ' into a chill November wind ! without an overcoat to greet his guest , looked to the past for words of praise . Mr. Kennedy said Dr. Adenauer had wisely led Germany into the Atlantic community and thereby assured himself of a place in history . He welcomed him as " au old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he also spoke of the great changes in the world , in both ' the East and the West , and of a new generation - of leaders building upon the judgments of the past . In response , the 86-year-old Chancellor was even more direct in acknowledging differences in age and viewpoint . He said his " political memory " was still very young and that age counted for less than experience . He said Germans were grateful for American aid after the " terrible catastrophe " of World War II and for that reason had developed a strong attachment to American principles , especially those of liberty and freedom . " Of course , the Germans have their faults , too , " the Chancellor asserted . " Who has not any faults ? But the Lord forgives some of these faults and some of the sins and , therefore , I feel one should also forgive the Germans their old sins , if they do not commit any new ones . But I am sure that the Germans have learned something from the past .

He assured the President and a large group of Administration officials at lunch that " there is nobody " in Bonn who wants to tamper with freedom and liberty of the press . Dr. Adenauer congratulated , the President several times for the " very firm stand " he had taken on Cuba . He described the outcome as a " very great success " for the United States and a " failure " for Premier Khrushchev . He said it allowed the world once again to see Mr. Khrushchev " as he really is . " This closing remark of a luncheon toast appeared to be the Chancellor 's main message in two long private discussions // with the President .

American sources indicated that the discussion reached a consensus that no major initiatives toward East-West negotiations could be taken until the Cuban crisis had been finally settled and assessed .
