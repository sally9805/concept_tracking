William R. Hearst Jr. , editor in chief of the Hearstpapers , likes to introduce National Editor Frank R. Conniff as " the house Democrat . " This at once pays affectionate tribute to the staunch Republicanism of the Hearstpapers , to Conniff 's equally unsubornable allegiance to the other party , and to the indulgence of Bill Hearst himself . Last week Democrat Conniff , 49 , reached for a House more sizable than Hearst 's . He accepted the Democratic nomination as candidate for Congress from a suburban Westchester district . <P> <P> Conniff 's candidacy pits journalist against journalist . The incumbent is Ogden R. ( " Brownie " ) Reid Jr. , 38 , who was president of the New York Herald Tribune for three years before the paper was sold to John Hay Whitney Jr . Before running for Congress , he was U.S. Ambassador to Israel . <P> <P> Reid 's journalistic qualifications do not match Conniff 's . A Hearst staffer since 1936 , Conniff is a member in excellent standing of the " Hearst Task Force , " which roams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is Hearst 's right-hand man for all the papers . He also writes an increasingly popular column that is syndicated by King Features . <P> <P> Politically , however , Brownie Reid has everything working for him . His district , embracing most of Westchester County , has never yet sent a Democrat to Washington . Voter registration is Republican 2 to 1 , a ratio so immutable that any man the Republicans put up campaigns largely for appearance 's sake . Moreover , during his two years in office , although Congressman Reid has done little , he has done absolutely nothing to turn the voters against him .
