When the U.S. Navy launched its Mobile Riverine Force in South Viet Nam 's canal-laced Mekong Delta , it soon became obvious that servicing the mini-flotilla was a maxi-headache . Riverine 's little boats would slip into the maze of marshlands for long patrols , far from the medical and military aid of the mother ship anchored in one of the larger rivers . The most obvious means of supply was by helicopter , but most of the Delta is too wet and soft to support the weight of a chopper . <P> The solution , worked out by a civilian in the Navy 's Research &; Development unit at Saigon , is as inexpensive as it is uncomplicated . After a brief visit to the Delta last summer , Berger Shepard , who usually develops mines for the Navy , designed and built in just four days the world 's smallest aircraft carrier . Constructed from pipes and a 16-ft. by 16-ft. steel mat ( total cost : $300 ) , the helicopter landing pad was fitted atop the foredeck of a 56-ft . Armored Troop Carrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device was an immediate success , and in the past year eleven more have been rigged . <P> Landing on the makeshift " flight deck " is a ticklish operation demanding split-second timing by pilot and boat crew . As a UH-1 chopper hovers over the mini-carrier , the landing area is invisible to the pilot , who must rely on hand signals from one of the boat 's seven-man crew . Meanwhile , the boat 's captain maneuvers his vessel under the skids of the descending helicopter . The air-sea mating has become a smooth routine . In more than 2,000 landings , there has yet to be a serious mishap . <P> The converted ATCS , called " Aid Boats " by Delta G.I.s , puff along at eight knots behind the Mobile Riverine 's speedier patrol boats , whose missions are to inspect sampans for smuggled arms and materiel and attack suspected Viet Cong strongholds . The little flattops serve as refueling depots for support helicopters and as supply ships . But their most important duty is to serve as floating Medevac stations for the attack ships . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2,000 soldiers and 1,800 sailors in the flotilla were killed or wounded as their craft , weaving through the narrow canals , were targets for snipers and mortar and rocket attacks . Navy personnel , who regularly man the Delta craft , stand a 70% chance of being wounded during a year 's service with the Riverine Force . The Aid Boats , bristling with machine guns , grenade launchers and a cannon , are able to go to the rescue . Wounded are picked up and shuttled away from enemy fire , then quickly evacuated on " dust-off " helicopters to the nearest U.S. hospital . In the festering Delta , such swift care of combat wounds often spells the difference between life and death .
