Seat belts may be all right for adults , but try keeping a squirming five-year-old child buckled up for a long automobile ride . It can not be done , short of resorting to chloroform . Last week the Ford Motor Co. showed off its answer : a 5-lb. padded plastic body shield called the " Tot Guard . " The child sits on a molded seat ; then a loosely fitting , one-piece leg-and-body " cast " is placed over him . The seat belt loops around in front to secure the entire apparatus , allowing the child to move around inside his cast but also to stay in one place . <P> Ford engineers have tested the device extensively on their own children and claim that the kids ride contentedly for as long as four hours at a time . The Tot Guard will be available at Ford dealers next month at $19.95.
