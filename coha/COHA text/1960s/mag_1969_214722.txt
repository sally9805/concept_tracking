THE MARX BROTHERS AT THE MOVIES by Paul D. Zimmerman and Burt Goldblatt. 224 pages . Putnam. $7.95 . <P> What has eight legs and laughs ? ran the question in the ' 30s . Answer : the Marx Brothers . Later they lost a pair of legs , when Zeppo dropped out of the act . Groucho , Chico and Harpo went on to make eight more films together , becoming precursors of the new American humor . Groucho 's flip irrelevancies foreshadowed the theater of the absurd : " I 'd horsewhip you if I had a horse . " Harpo was a troll bridge between the silents and the talkies . " How can you write for Harpo ? " shrugged George S. Kaufman . " All you can say is , ' Harpo enters . ' From that point on , he 's on his own . " Though Chico 's accent was an Italian defamation league all to itself , his shrewd con-mannerisms and manic assaults on the piano were often brilliant pieces of destructive art . <P> The Brothers Marx found themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Algonquin Round Table ; Groucho corresponded with T. S. Eliot in a number of letters that showed that he thought of himself as a cerebral clown . But the old vaudeville team had begun its film career comparatively late in life-in 1929 , at the time of their first film , The Cocoanuts , Chico was 40-and by the late ' 40s their creative energy had faded . To a whole generation of television viewers , the Marxes are at once as familiar and as obscure as the Smith Brothers . <P> The Marx Brothers at the Movies , ( text by Zimmerman , graphics by Goldblatt ) restores the team to its proper prominence . Customarily , the most static objects in the world are books about movies ; pictures float by on oceans of turgid or fawning prose , while the subject drowns . In The Marx Brothers at the Movies the text is as good as the pictures . The still ones , that is ; nothing can quite match the films . Zimmerman shows just how much Groucho could inscribe on the head of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's plenty . I do n't think I could handle more than a gal a day . " He retells the best of the anecdotes from the days when the boys were as funny off-screen as on . Best of all , the book resists the temptation to analyze , observing E. B. White 's dictum : " Humor can be dissected , as a frog can , but the thing dies in the process . " <P> Harpo and Chico are dead , and Zeppo has been retired for 36 years . Groucho is confined to occasional cameos in such humorless atrocities as Skidoo . In lieu of a reel of their films , this book is the best possible way to meet the Marx Brothers when they had all their energy , all their laughs and all their feet .
