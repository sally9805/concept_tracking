A U.S. cartoonist , poking fun at the Soviet propensity for stealing the inventions of other nations , once created a Russian inventor named Regus Patoff , an acronym for the omnipresent " Reg . U.S. Pat . Off . " Last week , after decades of pirating others ' ideas without so much as a thank you , the Russians joined the Paris Convention of 1883 , the pact under which 67 nations agree to honor one another 's patents and trademarks . In the future the Russians will have to pay the same licensing fees as everyone else when they cast a covetous eye on a new product or process . In return , the West is taking steps to recognize the U.S.S.R. 's internal system of " inventors ' certificates " as equivalent to patents . <P> The Russians had a change of heart simply because they see rising opportunities for trade with the West and did not want their pirating to stand in the way . Moreover , Russian technology is beginning to devise a number of items that other nations might be interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Russians want to get paid for their use . " The Soviets have come to realize that they may get more profit from joining than from staying out , " says Dr. Georg Bodenhausen , head of the Geneva-based International Union for the Protection of Industrial Property , which administers the Paris pact . <P> The pact is hard to enforce if anyone really wants to circumvent it ; Boden-hausen 's organization has no legal weapons against transgressors , simply passes along complaints to governments involved . Any member of the pact can unilaterally exempt specific products from patent protection ; Italy has done so with Pharmaceuticals , thus enabling Italian firms to copy the world 's new drugs as fast as they are invented . Several big nations , such as India , Pakistan , Argentina and Chile , remain outside the system , some of them figuring that they invent too little to profit from it . Nor does the pact protect artistic or literary copyrights , which come under the Bern Convention-to which the Russians still refuse to subscribe . <P> Though the patent accord will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West , the Russians will continue to pirate foreign books as often as they please .
