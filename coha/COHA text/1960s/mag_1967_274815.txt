Franklin D. Roosevelt has been dead for nearly 22 years , but it may take an other generation before anybody can decide on a suitable monument to him in Washington . The project began in 1959 with a nationwide competition that produced ( out of 574 entries ) a design by Sculptor Norman Hoberman for eight soaring concrete and marble tablets covered with Roosevelt quota tions .

Breuer 's design envisaged free-standing walls radiating from a central court yard ( TIME , Dec. 30 ) . " Pure geometry , " he called it , and won approval from the family and the Roosevelt Memorial Commission .

" Such a memorial requires the highest standards of artistic achievement and significance , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not fulfill either criterion . "
