txt By John C. Waugh Staff Correspondent of The Christian Science Monitor Los Angeles Physical scientists now know a lot about up and want to know more about down . While not of 60 nations intend , in the next three years , to make a dent in man 's abysmal lack of knowledge about the region in earth 's interior down to about 450 miles . They call this global effort the Upper Mantle Project , because that is what the region from about 20 to 450 miles underground is . The project will constitute another major international scientific effort that has found its example in the International Geophysical Year ( IGY ) of 1957-58 . First Topic Tackled Earth scientists from many lands began meeting Monday in Berkeley , Calif. , at the 13th General Assembly of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics ( IUGG ) . ' Topic No. 1 of the two-week session will be the upper mantle and the plans for its scientific conquest by scientists of the world . During the IGY the most spectacular discoveries added to man 's book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space . The most dramatic tool of the ages for the firsthand study of space , the artificial earth satellite , burst dramatically on the world ken . Revolution Launched Natural scientists and laymen alike riveted their attention to such major discoveries in space as the vast belts of trapped radiation girdling the earth . As the IGY ended , a revolution had been launched in the Earth Probes study of atmosphere and space . Earth scientists clearly want now to spark a like revolution in the knowledge of the deep of earth . What do scientists now know about the earth 's interior ? They all are generally agreed , on the basis of limited knowledge , that earth is composed of several major layers or spherical shells separated by discontinuities . Information Limited On top , reaching down 20 to 40 miles , is earth 's crust . Below it , separated by a discontinuity , is the mantle , which extends downward about 1,800 miles . Deepest is the core , believed to be a molten liquid . V. V. Beloussov , the distinguished Soviet geophysicist and current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldwide upper-mantle study by nations in concert , says that " our knowledge of the interior stops seven or eight kilometers below our feet ( about 25,000 feet , the deepest man has drilled ) . " In short , it goes no deeper than earth 's thin crust . Seismology and geology have put together limited conceptions about the physical properties within earth 's interior . Geologists have chartered a reasonably extensive history of the major processes within the interior over major land areas . But as Professor Beloussov points out , " Why these powerful processes take place , and what causes them , is still left unanswered . Here we get stuck in the opaque media of hypotheses and unsteady suppositions . " Answers Sought The three-year international upper-mantle project , beginning this year , will aim to find a few first answers to the why and the what . Professor Beloussov explains that the international effort will be limited to the earth 's crust and upper mantle simply because the activity that affects earth 's crust appears to go no deeper . As in the IGY , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upper-mantle project . But the studies will be directed and correlated internationally and will be closely interrelated , involving all of the earth sciences . As Professor Beloussov cryptically states , " The great tectonic processes do not heed state borders . " " Different , branches of geophysics will unite to give the pattern of distribution of the physical properties of material in the crust and the upper mantle , " Professor Beloussov explains . " Naturally , the geophysical methods will provide conceptions about contemporary physical processes in the earth 's interior : seismic , thermal , etc . " Geodesy in cooperation with geomorphology shall study the distribution of recent and modern tectonic movements , vertical and horizontal . Geochemistry shall provide data for the understanding , of the possible matter composition of the deep material and of its changes with time . " During the three years of the project , comparative studies of a group of major tectonic zones will be launched . Major transcontinental geophysical surveys will begin .                @ @ @ @ @
