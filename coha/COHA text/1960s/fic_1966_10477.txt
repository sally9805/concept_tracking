" Seems , " said Mendoza . " And I think Jase was right , Art . You called this one down on us , claiming you were bored . Teach you a lesson . " Hackett laughed . " Could be . But how often do we get the really subtle things like in all the paperbacks , Luis ? Probably turn out , with a little closer look , the Manning woman was mixing up some homemade face cream or something and it got into the scrambled eggs by accident . " " Anything could be , " said Mendoza , " in that house-hold . " Landers was still out , presumably chasing up missing reports . Higgins was sitting at his desk poring over some notes , still figuring plate numbers and possible errors and transpositions . Mendoza called the lab and asked for the full treatment on that secondhand shop . Thinking of the collection of odds and ends , he mentally wished the lab boys joy of it . Funny people , he thought . Vide Mr. Caradoccio . With a vengeance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained to earn livings  --  but an eccentric family to start with , and finding their own level in this backwater slum . Staying on of inertia , living hand to mouth . Inevitably attracting others of their own kind , the flotsam and jetsam . Living on the proceeds of the secondhand store , the minutely-payingroomers , Henry 's embroidery ? And what did Oscar the friendly undertaker contribute ? Yes , and Ben . Look up Ben 's pedigree . And , of course , find out more about Eliza McCann . A widow ? Evidently . About enemies and friends . Mendoza yawned and looked at his watch . Five-thirty . He did n't care one hell of a lot who had given Eliza McCann homemade poison , or how , or why . No denying , this nice spring weather was enervating . Conducive top51goofing off . He thought a little sleepily that it 'd be nice to take off with Alison say up to Lake Elsinore or somewherefor the weekend , and the hell with the job . The hell with Eliza McCann ( yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and the suicide , and even Patrolman Harry Cohen . Higgins and his plate numbers . " You asleep ? " asked Sergeant Farrell . Mendoza started . " No . What 's up ? " " George 's gone home . I got a note for him . The D.M.V. checked out some of those substitute plate numbers he dreamed up . He 's got a Roman Catholic priest in Oxnard , the president of an oil company in Oakland , and a local gynecologist . Well , I suppose anything 's possible . " Mendoza got up . " I , " he said , " am going home too . Anything'spossible , Rory . "  |p52At  about the same time , Landers was standing in the lobby of the Stewart Hotel on Olive , talking to the desk clerk . The Stewart Hotel was where Mary Brown had or had not committed suicide , and Landers was back there because he wanted to talk to the second-floor maid , who might have talked with Mary Brown and who 'd been off duty yesterday . " Happy as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It never crossed my mind  --  not that you go around expecting guests to commit suicide . This ai n't the Beverly Hilton , but it 's a respectable hotel , and this girl looks ordinary as could be . Nice smile . Paid in cash , says is n't it a nice day and all , and I  --  There she is now , just coming in . Oh , Agnes ! " The maid was enlightening . Some . Agnes Rombin , ap53rather handsome young Negro girl . She had talked with Mary Brown . ( Why did n't people use some imagination when they gave false names ? ) She 'd been passing the door of 209 about six o'clock on Wednesday evening when Mary Brown came out and asked her if she knew of a good cheap place to eat nearby . " She was a nice girl , you could tell , " said Agnes . " Just does n't seem possible she went and did such a thing . Friendly , she was . I thought at the time , it was like she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all happy and excited because she was going to be married . Next day , she told me . D' you figure maybe the boy backed out at the last minute and that was the reason ? " She shook her head . " An awful thing . " " Oh , really ? " said Landers . " That could be . Did she tell you anything else , Miss Rombin ? His name ? " " No , it was just a minute or two we talked . I told her Daniels ' down the block was nice and clean and not very expensive , and she thanked me , and  --  Oh , now , there was that , yes , sir . She said it was the first time she 'd been in L.A. , did n't know her way around the city . " " Oh , " said Landers . Not a local ? So Mary Brown would n't be either of the girls reported missing who vaguely matched the description . That was helpful in a way . But then he went back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the autopsy report had come in ; it had , and Piggott was readingit . He listened to what Landers had to say about the maid , and said , " So here 's the other half of the story , " and passed over the report . " You need n't wade through all the six-dollar words . Two things . It was prescriptive sleeping pills , and she was four months ' gone . " " Oh , hell , " said Landers . " So we know . " He had n't liked the lack of a note ; in his admittedly limited experience ,  |p54|pretty  young girls who killed themselves left notes  --  often long ones  --  saying why . But with this " So the father backed out at the last minute and she could n't face it and bingo , " said Piggott . " Yes , " said Landers , and had a second thought . " But , you know , Matt , I still do n't like it . Not just on the fact of no note . Because , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't any container in the room . She could n't have been much over twenty , and coming to the big city to get married , all happy and excited , not very likely she brought anything like that with her  --  was in the habit of taking it . She could n't have bought them over the counter . I still think there 's something fishy about it . " Piggott scratched his jaw and said when you put it like that he guessed maybe so did he . " And , anyway , we 've still got to find out who she was . If just to notify any relatives . And her real name might tell us , via the relatives , who the father was apt to be . " " Yes , " said Landers . " And maybe we 're being too cynical , Matt . Big-city cops . It could be that Mary Brown is her real name . " " And so , " said Mendoza , " we sealed the door of her bedroom  --  belatedly , but we 'll go over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and came away . " He held out his cup for more coffee . " You do run into characters , " said Alison , pouring from the pot that had been sitting on its warmer . " I like Gertrude . I suppose you 'll have to tell the , um , relevant authoritiesabout her ? Livestock in the city  --  " " I should , " said Mendoza ; and Sheba landed on his shoulder from behind and he spilled half the coffee over his empty plate . " iVaya por Dios ! iMonstruo ! Talk about livestock  --  "  | " No , Sheba ! Monster is about right , she 's doing it to everybody  --  " Mendoza plucked her off and dropped her on the floor ; Sheba complained loudly . " And I 've got to go back there tonight , see those two that were out . Oh , and I suppose Bobby the newsboy . The hell of it is there 's no way of knowing just when McCann got it , it could have been after she got to the store  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auburn head at him . " Look , you be careful , amante . That 's not such a good part of town , and the way these muggings and senselessviolence are on the increase  --  I suppose you would n't consider packing the gun ? " Mendoza laughed impatiently . " Ni que nina muerta ! The more I think about it , the more inclined I am to think that it must have been accidental in some way  --  though of course  --  Well , we have to look at it anyway . " He shoved his chair back into Nefertiti , crouched just behind it , and Nefertiti yelled and had to be apologized to . Mrs. MacTaggartgart came in , surveyed Mendoza benignly , and asked if he 'd like his rum pudding . " Later , Mairi , could n't do it now . " He got up and stepped on Bast 's tail ; she yelled . " ! Porvida. ! And the city outlaws one harmless nanny goat ! There is too much livestock in this house ! And El Senor stealing my rye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one arm in his as they went down the hall , " I really do n't like it , Luis . That neighborhood  --  and the ones you 'll be driving through . At least , for heaven 's sake , lock the car doors . " " You starting to act the nervous wife at this late date ? " Alison made a face at him . " I know , I know ! Experi-encedcop can take care of himself . And that 's your stampingground , you know it . Night and day . Just be careful . Some of these J.D. 's  --  "  | " I 'll be careful . Do n't fuss , " said Mendoza inattentively , and reached for his hat . The ramshackle big building looked different by night , true ; the whole street did . Narrow ancient street tucked away in this oldest part of town , now part of the jungle any big city sprouts , any time and anywhere , the jungle of Skid Row , of poor people , of the border line of pro crime , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a backwater surrounded by the jungle . He left the Ferrari outside the Caradoccio house , where lights showed and voices sounded , and walked back to the looming old hotel . Oscar let him in . And he wanted a little talk with Oscar too , and now was as good a time as any to have it . Standing there in the bare dusty lobby , he prodded Oscar with questions . How long had they lived here ? Who exactly did live here ? Occupations ? And so on . He knew the general answersfrom Caradoccio ; he wanted to get Oscar talking , and it was n't difficult . " The depression  --  " Oscar rambled on about that . Money , this the only property left  --  built by his grandfather , a very fine hotel once  --  " Well , we managed , we live very simply , as you see , we had to at first and I suppose we got in the habit of it . . . Oh , well , yes , my older sister Dottie , yes , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an old lady  --  they travel a good deal . My other brothers , well , really , I do n't know why you should be interested ; they do n't live with us now . I 'm afraid we 're none of us great letter writers , I seem to recall the last time we heard from Stephen he was in Rome . . . What ? Oh , well , Miss Manning  --  the poor dear 's quite harmless , I expect she 'll stay on even when Ellie  --  she 's used to our ways now and vice versa , as it were  --  "   " Was your sister a widow ? " " Well , now that I 'm afraid we do n't know , " said Oscar with a small titter . There had been no sound from beyond the double doors , from the rest of the building . " She  --  ah  --  married just before we  --  you know  --  before all the money went . My father had n't liked the young man  --  of course Ellie was n't exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband left her . After the money went . Quite soon . I 'm afraid it did rather embitter her . We 've never laid eyes on him since . . . Oh , well , I helped her in the shop sometimes , and so did Percy  --  moving things and so on  --  And , of course , Percy 's family makes him a small monthly allowance . " Remittance man , thought Mendoza . He 'd thought it was an extinct breed . " It brings in quite a steady little profit  --  the shop , that is . I suppose I should try to keep it up , but Ellie knew just how to manage  --  really she was quite sharp at dickering with people  --  " Oscar was nervous , thought Mendoza . He wondered why . He seemed to be all there , if eccentric ; possibly he 'd been mulling over the facts . " We 'll be looking over your sister'sroom , of course , " he said casually . " Very probably we 'll want to search the whole building . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if it  --  " " The building ! " squeaked Oscar . " The hotel ? " He uttereda high titter . " My dear good sir , you 've no idea  --  the things one accumulates in thirty-five years ! And the size of the place  --  we do n't use the top floor at all , not for years and years  --  that 's all tiny little servants ' quarters and so on  --  poison  --  you have n't said what , and I still think it must have been quite accidental , though that 's not like Ellie  --  still , you ca n't be serious about  --  my dear good sir , there are over eighty rooms here ! And I can not see  --  " " Quite serious , Mr. McLaughlin . And I 'd like to see Mrs. Rialto now . And the others I did n't see this afternoon . "  | " Oh dear , oh dear , " said Oscar , agitated . " Yes , of course , I 'll take you up  --  I do n't think Bobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he 's only a bit retarded , you know , a simple young fellow . Mrs. Rialto  --  " It was an impossible old rabbit warren of a place , and Mendoza wondered if the fire department ever got round to taking a look at some of these old buildings for hazards . Feeling his way up the creaking front staircase after Oscar , he reckoned up mentally : ten people living in an eighty-room building . Scattered around , probably . Likingprivacy , you could say . And what a place . By all appearances , the building  --  old then  --  had been wired for electricity some time in the twenties : there were obviously converted gas jets at the landing and along the walls in the corridor , and at most they might now be holding fortywattbulbs ; not all of them were switched on . Four stories , top-floor servants ' quarters : about twenty rooms to a floor , some on the ground floor besides the offices and lobby . Oscar was knocking at a door halfway down the corridor . " I 'm sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police officer wanting to talk to you  --  you know the one I mentioned  --  aboutEllie . He  --  " " Quite all right , Oscar . " The door opened suddenly and Myra Rialto gave them a wide smile . " If this shocking thing is true , we must all cooperate with the authorities to the fullest extent . How do you do ? Yes , indeed , I see a dark aura all about you , young man  --  not your own , but indicatingthat you deal with dark , dark forces . Come in . What do you want of little Myra ? " She was a plump little woman , about sixty , with pepperand-salthair crisply curling and agelessly beautiful immensedark eyes . She 'd evidently just washed her face , towel still in one hand , and she wore no make-up ; she looked her age but was quite unself-conscious about it.  |p59She  had on a crisply clean and starched cotton housecoat , zipped up the front , and altogether was the most **27;7303;TOOLONG he 'd met in the place . He went in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the best in the hotel , at least twenty feet square . It was pleasantly if shabbily furnished with a double bed neatly made up with a blue cotton spread , a tall walnut chiffonier , a goodsizedbookcase full of paperbacks , an old-fashioned standingwardrobe . There was a floor lamp between two shabby old overstuffed chairs , a small table . Myra Rialto shut the door on Oscar firmly . " Poor little man , " she said . " Now , my good police officer , you really must not think that because I live among these delightfullyuninhibited people I am myself at all eccentric . To be quite frank , it 's very cheap , and I have very little money . A part-time job in a rather vulgar little dress shop . The one thing I will not do is take money for the exercise of my psychic gifts  --  quite fatal , the spirits frown on it absolutely . Now you are terribly psychic yourself , you know  --  I do n't know your name . Do sit down . " " Lieutenant Mendoza . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could have just a teeny-weeny guess , I 'd say you are Pisces . When is your birthday , Lieutenant ? " Mendoza felt small surprise . Once in a long while , he thought , there might be a very little something to  --  " Yes , February twenty-eighth . Now what I  --  " " Of course . And what 's all this about Ellie being poisoned ? I 'm sure Oscar had it all wrong . . . No ? But , dear me , what a fantastic thing . A very managing person , she was , but after all in this household  --  I mean the McLaughlinsthemselves  --  someone had to be , you know . Of course Henry is a law unto himself . But poisoned ? With what , may I ask ? " It might start a hare or two to let that out ; Mendoza toldP60her . " Oh , really ? " she said . " How extremely unusual . " She opened the carved wooden box on the coffee table between the chairs and took out a cigarette ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you like . How very odd . You know , if it had been on a Sunday , I should have said at once , Tabitha Thirkettle . " She turned her beautiful dark eyes on him solemnly . " Tabitha  --  And why would you say that , Mrs. Rialto ? " asked Mendoza equably . She smiled at him . " Because Eliza was not a churchgoer , you see  --  a free soul if sadly unbelieving  --  I do n't press belief on anyone , Lieutenant , but my own deep experience and knowledge only lead me to certainty of God 's great goodness  --  but Eliza , no . On Sundays Eliza enjoyed her only recreation , one might  --  " Mrs. Rialto started violently and dropped her cigarette . From somewhere close at hand a shrill female voice was upraised in what was meant for song . Like a drunken power drill it soared to siren heights and fell to buzz-saw depths . " There is bee-yooty in the bellow of the buh-last , There is guh-randeur in the guh-rowling of the gale  --  There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a-lashing of his ta-yul ! " The musical Mrs. Lightfoot tonight had switched to Gilbert and Sullivan . Mendoza repressed a forceful exclamation ; he had an ear of sorts , and he liked TheMikado . Mrs. Rialto got up and opened the door . She knocked loudly on the door across the hall .   " Yay-ess , I like to see a ti-yiger From the Congo or the Niger And es-peshully when  --  " " Dear ? Dear Florence  --  " "  --  a-lash-hashing  --  " " Florence ! " "  --  of his tay-yail  --  " " Oh , Myra . Something , dear ? " " If you would n't mind , dear . I 've this nice police officer , all about Eliza , and I was just telling him about Tabitha Thirkettle . " " Ooh , of course ! The moment Oscar told me , I had the same thought ! Not that I 've ever laid eyes on the woman , and of course it was n't a Sunday , was it ? Does he want to see me too ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if you 'd just postponeyour practicing ? " " Yes , of course , dear . I 'll be only too glad to tell him whatever I can , but I do n't know anything at all . I never saw Eliza on Wednesday . " " That 's right , dear . " Myra came back in and shut the door . " Silly woman , but no harm in her , dear man . No voice , of course . Husband left her practically nothing , and she lives in her dreams . As we all do , as we all do . But I was talking about this Thirkettle woman . On Sundays Eliza always went to a little luncheon party . These four women , old friends  --  for years these rather dreary little luncheons , the innocuous gossip  --  I say that because nothingever happened to any of them , you know , that wasP62important  --  I believe they did generally meet at the Thirkettlewoman 's apartment , wherever it is , you could ask Oscar  --  and I 'm afraid that 's the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Because Eliza had spoken of her . Mmm  --  scornfully . Eliza had no patience with aches and pains , as someone may have told you . Never even took aspirin . And the Thirkettle woman  --  yes , it is an odd name , is n't it ? " said Myra , uncannily echoing his thought . " The Thirkettle woman has a hobby . She brews simples . " " Simples ? I do n't  --  " " Simples . A charming old word for it . The old-fashioned country remedies . Inner bark of barberry taken in white wine as a purgative  --  and infusion of poppy seeds for pleurisy  --  and so on . Quite legendary , most of it , but  --  interesting . She doses herself , I understand  --  the Thirkettlewoman  --  cough sirups of horehound and all that sort of thing . And Eliza thought it was utter nonsense . As perhaps it may be , but then  --  you do see what I mean ? " The dark eyes widened on him . " I 'm afraid I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncharitable personat the best of times  --  a young soul who could not grasp the wider reality . Whatever sad experiences we meet , they must be made a maturing influence but that Eliza did not realize . A critical woman , dear man . One should not be . We have all somewhat to give and to receive . But what I was about to say  --  from the little I heard from Eliza about the Thirkettle woman , I would suppose that wherever she lives , she has some means to grow her little innocent herbs and weeds . And now you are telling us that poor Eliza died of this  --  concoction . Very peculiar , but if it had been on a Sunday , I should at once have blamed the accident on the Thirkettle wornan and her simples . Quite without intention , of course . But if she had been experimenting  --  "   " ; Pues si ! " said Mendoza interestedly . " And it could be . You do n't know where she lives ? " " No idea , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " This could be very helpful , yes , thanks . Did you see Mrs. McCann that day  --  Wednesday ? " " No , I did n't . Little Myra was up and away by seventhirty , and I have a hot plate here for coffee , I stopped at a Mannings ' uptown for a real breakfast . And of course it was a shock when Oscar told us all  --  But now you tell me what it was , I did at once think of the Thirkettle woman . " Repeated knocks and calls at all the closed doors on the ground floor failed to raise Oscar or anybody else . There was one feeble overhead light burning in the vast lobby and apparently no other lights anywhere ; even now the old doors fitted tightly . The double doors were locked . Mendoza felt his way back down a narrow hall at the rear of the lobby , into another vast room he guessed was the kitchen by the faint odor , but gropings failed to find a switch . He was annoyed ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the Celtic Hotel tonight . This business . Simples  --  my God . Tabitha Thirkettle . Tomorrow would do ; it was after ten . He groped back to the lobby and let himself out into a thick , black , soft spring night . Little smog ; what stars showed were clear and bright . The door clicked solidly shut after him , locking itself . He went down the steps to the sidewalk . Few street lights along here , and the one in the middle of the block was out : kids throwing rocks , probably . Thesidewalk was cracked and uneven ; he walked carefully . The attack was incredibly sudden and savage . A rushp64of steps behind him , the heavy blow at the back of his neck  --  As he started to fall , Alison 's warning sounded clear inside his head : senseless violence  --  muggings  --  With violent effort he twisted as he fell , braced himself to kick up at any continued attack . Vague dark form bending over him  --  something struck viciously at the side of his head out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it could cure epilepsy , said Bainbridge . Simples . My dear good man . Thirkettle . If it had been a Sunday . Mendoza uttered a strangled groan and moved . He opened his eyes . He had a terrific headache ; odd  --  he never had headaches . He was staring up at a night sky , city night sky that is never wholly black , and a lot of stars . Mugger . Hit on the head with something . This part of town . A damned fool ; he ought to know better  --  been on guard  --  experienced cop taking care of himself " 1 Un milldn de demonios ! " he muttered . He sat up shakily . Investigated his pockets . He was muzzily surprised to find billfold intact , keys , change . Alison . Alison sayingDamn fool . Let some lout of a J.D.-Painfully he dragged himself to his knees , his feet . He 'd been on the way back to the car  --  He staggered into the darkened lamppost , grazed one hand on its rough surface . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car . The shape of the hood under his hands said the Ferrari . He fumbled with the keys , managed to get the door unlocked . He hoisted himself inside , the wrong side  --  not under the wheel . He shut the door and locked it . A really terrific headache . He 'd never hear the last of itP65from Alison . Told you to be careful . But better not try to drive . He groped for the telephone installed in the dashboardand dialed the office unsteadily . " She is , " said Angel Hackett , " a perfectly normal baby . Most of them are saying gah ' at three months and sucking their big toes . Talk about men going idiotic over daugh-ters  --  " " She 's a very bright little girl , she is , " said Hackett fatuously . " She 's my own Sheila girl , is n't she ? She 's Daddy 's own  --  " " Men ! " said Angel . The phone rang . " Gah , " said Daddy 's own Sheila brilliantly . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's the office . " Hackett abruptly made the transition from Daddy to sergeant . " Hackett . What 's up ? . . . Oh my God ! Now what 's the damn fool been  --  All right , all right , I 'm on my way ! Has anybody called Alison ? Better let me  --  " P66Slight concussion , said the nurse in First Aid professionally ; nothing much , but he 'd better spend a day or two in bed . " Be damned if I will , " said Mendoza . " If you 'll give me something for this headache , I 'll be O.K. Why in God 's name did they rout you out ? " he added to Hackett . " Break the news to the widow , but seems I 'm not due to get your desk so soon . What the hell were you doing down there alone ? " " A quarter block back to the car , for God 's sake , I 'm grown up . And letting some mugger  --  " " Oh , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get rolled ? It could have been one of those jokers from the hotel . I do n't see why , but that bunch  --  " " iQue disparate ! No reason . The little glimpse I had , itP67could have been a teen-ager . Inclined to think maybe one who has n't graduated from the kid stuff and panicked when I showed fight . I could n't have been out thirty sec-onds . " " I still think  --  " " Now , really , you see Henry stealing out to lay an ambush ? " Mendoza sat up , clutching his temple , and the nurse said the pill should work soon . " There 's Ben . Dark horse , that one , if you ask me . He 's not in our records , by the way  --  lase looked . Come on , I 'll get you home . You stay in bed tomorrow . " " Do n't be a fool , I 'm all right . Thank God that pill is taking hold . Listen , what I picked up tonight  --  " Mendoza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And I know Alison , if I do n't get in at the usual time  --  " " Which you wo n't . I know her too . " " You start to follow that up . It 's very likely this female and her little concoctions are mixed up in this somehow . " " Yes , I see that , " said Hackett . " I 'll get on it . " He drove Mendoza home , to be greeted by an Alison saying , " I told you to be careful . Just lucky you were n't killed . Of all the idiotic things to do  --  " He left Mendoza still being lectured and protesting he was all right and went home to tell Angel about it . Hackett got to the office a few minutes late on Saturday morning and found Landers and Piggott looking glumly at a lab report . " Some garage over in South Pasadena called in , " said Landers . " Car left for repairs looked as if it might have been in an accident . Higgins went over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it up to you . This Brown thing . No billfold , no identity cards . Well , all right , not all women carry billfolds  --  a lot do , but a lot do n't . And not all women have driver 's licenses either , or library cards ,  |p68or  even Social Security cards . Just because there was n't anything like that there does n't necessarily say all her identificationwas taken away . She need n't have had any . There was one of those double-pocket snap-purses in her handbag , with nineteen forty-three in it , bills one side , change the other ; a lot of women prefer those to a billfold . There 's a suitcase full of clothes , and the only labels are Sears , Roebuckand Lerner 's ; that says nothing . A girl without much money , maybe no job  --  that 's perfectly natural . Sears is national and Lerner 's covers most of California , I think . It does n't look as if anything was taken , even though the room door was n't locked . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they 're not on record . The hotel maid says the girl told her she 'd never been in L.A. before . Came expecting to be married . Did n't say from where . Came expecting to meet the boy friend ? Nothing to say where or who . " " Mmm-hmm , " said Hackett . " And we would like to find out , would n't we ? Whether she 's a suicide or not . What time did she register at the hotel , and did she come in a cab ? " Landers and Piggott exchanged a mournful glance . " No cab , " said Piggott . " Came walking in , lugging the suitcase , and if there 'd been a cab the hackie 'd have carried it in for her . Not a fancy hotel , no bellhops . She registered about four o'clock Wednesday afternoon . " " So , " said Hackett , " it 's nice weather for all the legwork . Be thankful it 's not September . You cover all the bus companies and railroad stations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what got in from where between , say , two-thirty and three-thirty , and then you locate all the bus drivers and conductors and stewardesses and show ' em a pretty picture of Mary Brown and ask if she traveled with them . " P69Landers uttered a groan . " I was hoping we were both wrong about that or you 'd be smart enough to figure a short cut . I know , I know . And I suppose the sooner we get started  --  " The pair of them went out looking resigned , passing Grace on his way in . Hackett told him about Mendoza 's misadventure and what he 'd dredged up from the Rialto woman . Grace said thoughtfully , " Bound to say he 's probably right  --  no reason for any of those people to go for him . Though that Ben  --  So I guess the first move is to locate this Thirkettle woman . With her **30;7332;TOOLONG brews . " " The Rialto woman said the sister might know if Oscar did n't . " " Come to think , we have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  bound to have some . " " By the rest of the family . The lab boys 'll be covering Eliza 's store today . And unless George gets something hot on the Cohen car  --  which I doubt  --  he may as well do a little work on that . " Hackett scribbled a note for Higgins and took up his hat . It was abundantly clear what Jane McLaughlin 's peculiaritieswere the minute they got into her room . It was Miss Manning who let them into the lobby downstairs : no sign of Oscar or Henry . How these people must rattle around in this place , thought Hackett , unwittingly echoing Mendoza 's reflections of the night before as they followed the fluttering scarves up the rickety stairs . And a wonder they did n't all have asthma or something , the dust and cobwebs : evidently the rooms in use were kept clean after a fashion , by their occupants , but the vast spaces not in use were just ignored . Dust lay thick in the bare corridors save for a traveled path down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the second floor , at the rear of the building . A small window at the end of theP70corridor there looked down on the rear of the property  --  as they were aware now , the minute rear yard all blacktopped , not a bush or a weed anywhere and , so far as they had seen , not even a potted plant in the hotel , much less anything resembling that straggly foxglove bush . Miss Manning 's murmur at the door was answered by an irascible voice within , and she opened the door with a vague smile past Hackett 's shoulder . The McLaughlins seemed to run to fat . Jane was fatter than Oscar or Henry , white-haired , with an unhealthilyjowledface with a bad-tempered mouth and little dark eyes peering at them suspiciously . Her hands were gnarled with arthritis . One glance and sniff round the room told she was a collector of medicines . Patent medicine mostly . On every free space stood bottles and jars and boxes of medicine . The room , much crowded with very old and shabby furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake , come or go , girl , " said Jane testily to Miss Manning . " Do n't stand there like an idiot . So the police finally condescend to talk to me ? " She stared at Grace with hot brown eyes . " Henry 's quite right . A pack of idiots , saying Eliza was poisoned . Ridiculous . And with sarsaparilla or weeping willow or whatever it was Myra was talking about . A silly woman , with her spirits and auras . " She was ensconced in an armchair beside the window ; half the stuffing from the chair was trailing about the floor from several long rents in the upholstery . " Well , if you 've got anything to say , speak up ! " " Just a few questions , Miss McLaughlin , " said Hackett . " Your sister had a habit of meeting some friends for lunch every Sunday . Could you tell us their names and addres-ses ? " Jane uttered a loud snort . " Friends ! Riffraff  --  that 's all . Old biddies who came into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oscar can talk all he wants about it being our mainstay  --  Ican hear what Father would have said ! And filling this place up "  --  an overstatement , thought Hackett  --  " with more riffraff ! " Suddenly she threw up the window with a crash and leaned to shout down at the rear yard . " Ben ! Ben ! You there ! Where 's Oscar ? You tell Oscar I want him ! " She slammed the window . " That one , if you please , is a murderer . Spent thirty or forty years in Sing Sing  --  I forget which . Oscar must be mad . And that Italian woman who walked away owing fifteen dollars  --  fifteen dollars  --  room rent and left that wretched monkey behind . I might be murdered in my bed any night . But who cares for me ? Why , it 's all I can do to get Oscar to fill out the forms for me ! " She cast off a tattered plaid shawl lying across her lap , to reveal a pile of equally tattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand at all the bottles and jars . " That old witch Miss Allenby  --  she goes picking over all the trash cans for blocks around , I get her to fetch back all the magazines . Free samples , you see . But Oscar complains about the postage . He 's a fool . As I ask him  --  does n't he want me to get well ? " " Miss McLaughlin , " said Grace in his softest voice , " these friends of Mrs. McCann 's  --  you know their names ? " " Oh , one of them was an Ida . I could n't be bothered . Eliza was coarsened by this impossible environment , she was only a girl when we came , of course . Ida Glidden , I believe . Now Mrs. Thirhettle , " said Jane grudgingly , " I will admit , while not a lady , is a trifle more genteel . She 's the only one I ever met  --  or cared to meet . Brought me some embrocation for my bad knee once . Sensible sort of woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you happen to know where she lives , ma'am ? " asked Grace . " I would n't ordinarily have bothered to take note , " saidp72Jane loftily , " but as it happens I do . Turner Street . I just recall her mentioning that she was lucky to have a small yard to grow her herbs . Look at that  --  it 's nine o'clock alreadyand Oscar has n't been near me . That idiotic woman brought my breakfast . Lucky if she does n't poison me , I daresay . What Ellie is thinking of  --  " She scarcely noticed when they left ; she was leaning out the window shouting at Ben again . " By what we can sort out , " said Grace as they felt their way down the dark stairs , " it seems Eliza was about the only one with a little common sense . At least she started that secondhand shop , all practical . Rest of ' em seemed to sit back and expect the Lord to provide . " " Well , Oscar had his undertaking parlor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign up and never did any more advertising at all . " " At least we know where Ben did his time , if she 's got that right . Ask Ossining and see . " " Urn , " said Grace . " You laying any bets on the Thirkettle'sbrews giving us the answer ? " " Lord knows . By all we 've got , Eliza was n't much for taking pills and such . " At least some progress had been made . When Higgins got back from South Pasadena  --  they 'd towed the suspect car in to Headquarters for a thorough examination  --  he found that Glasser had just brought in that mugger they 'd been looking for . A pal of his had tipped them off , being momentarily on the outs with him over a girl , and he 'd come apart as soon as they 'd asked him a few questions . As expectable , a little pedigree . Twenty-one now ; three juvenile counts of assault and robbery , one of attempted assault after he was eighteen , and on that  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probation . So now he 'd killedp73one old man , put a woman in the hospital , and injured another man , for a total take of around thirty bucks , and God alone knew what the next judge would hand him  --  a slap on the wrist and a weekend in jail , maybe . But it was n't up to the boys in blue to hand down the judgments . Their job was to catch the offenders , and despitethe unrealistic judges they went on doggedly and efficientlycatching the predators and hoping someday the bench would begin cooperating . Higgins read the note Hackett had left for him ; and about then Hackett called and relayed the news about Ben Kelly and Sing Sing . " O.K. , I 'll send a teletype , " said Higgins . " And you might do a little work for a change and chase over to that store . Start asking around . Anybody who might have been there on Wednesday morning . Because Bainbridge said one symptom would have been excitement , hysteria , and if anybody found her acting funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , O.K. , " said Higgins . He was feeling dispirited . Nothing at all on the hit-run , and it could be they 'd never get anything . He did n't really think this car they 'd brought in would tie up ; it was an old heap , sort of thing the high-school kids ran , and it was a kid who 'd brought it in to the garage for an estimate on repairs . See what the lab came up with , if there were bloodstains . And , damn it , he could n't for the life of him think of any halfway plausiblestory to tell Mary Dwyer to get Stevie to summer camp . . . Bert had been dead for not quite six months . The hell of a good guy , Bert . Higgins had settled it in his mind that he could n't ask her even to go to dinner with him until it had been at least six months . He sighed , passing a hand over his craggy , unhandsome features . Probably she would n't want to marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , he could do what he could for the kids  --  good kids , nice kids . He went down the hall and sent off a teletype to Ossining , New York . Then he went over to the secondhand store on Los Angeles Street and started asking around . All the other places in that block , and about any known customersof the McCann woman , whether anybody had visited her shop that morning . And so on . The lab boys were busy in the store , and that would be quite a job . Turner Street was a little dead-end street , also a backwater , also part of the jungle , just below the Southern Pacific railroad yards . A street of old , old little houses , frame houses of four , five , six rooms , and unlike a lot of streets down here  --  but there were a lot like Turner Street too , this being Los Angeles , California , and not New York  --  the houses were bordered by patches of brown lawn , patches of back and side yards with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Grace had found Mrs. Thirkettle rather easily by asking the clerk in the drugstore at the corner of Alameda ; and they 'd got this and that about the woman from him , too . Mrs. Thirkettle 's house was the sixth down the block , much neater than most of its neighbors , a small white house with a greener little patch of lawn in front . Mrs. Thirkettle herself was a little bird of a woman in the sixties , chipper and alert and brisk , and pathetically pleased for any company come upon any business . But she had n't known Eliza McCann was dead , and they had to give her a little time to exclaim and eulogize over that . It did n't look like acting , but then good acting would n't . " In the midst of life , that 's certainly true , and whop75would have thought  --  such a strong woman , and only sixtyfive  --  Imight have expected no one would let me know , her family  --  Well , I always thought she was a little bit ashamed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of them , she never talked about them . I ca n't get over it  --  so sudden ! " And so on . Not , thought Hackett , really grieved  --  as if the McCann woman had been a truly belovedfriend  --  but interested , conventionally sorry , and inevitably a bit uneasy , for her own age  --  And then , of course , " But you 're police officers , you said ? I do n't under-stand  --  " Grace told her , gently and easily . Another spate of talk . " But that 's fantastic ! You ca n't think  --  Eliza ? I do n't understand how  --  " She was a neat , normally cheerful little woman , her shabby old house neat and clean , a little woman who 'd never had much , had made do as she could , you could guess . This and that they had from the clerk , and more had emerged in her How of words . The husband a railroad man , only in the last few years of his life in on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little house paid for by scrimping and saving . The narrow life  --  a few friends , maybe distant relatives somewhere , her little hobby the one strong interest to her life . Hackett looked at Grace . A nice little woman . Very ordinary . ( Which maybe Eliza had found refreshing , after the Celtic Hotel 's inmates . ) If somehow Mrs. Tabitha Thirkettle 's hobby of brewing old-fashioned simples from herbs had resulted in the death of Eliza McCann , it would have been entirely accidental . Hackett started to ask questions . She was a bright old lady ; the sense of the questions penetrated her mind at once , and she stared at him in openmouthed horror.  | " Did Eliza ever  --  What do you mean ? Are you telling me  --  it was n't  --  was n't accidental ? That  --  " Hackett told her about the infusion of foxgloves . When she had this hobby , as they 'd been told , maybe she 'd know about that . Digitalis purpurea . And did she " Yes , " she said mechanically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her work-worn , strong little hands tightened on the arms of the old high-backed chair . Everything in this little , very tidy living room was old and worn and proudly maintained . Antimacassars on all the chairs , the couch . Shades drawn halfway to protect the rugs . The Woolworth china figurines on the mantel , the old-fashioned mantel clock , the framed photograph of the late husband  --  all meticulouslydusted . " But  --  you 're not imagining  --  I do n't ! " she said . " Nothing like that  --  nothing that could be dangerous  --  I never have any of those things ! Atropa belladonna or any of those ! I 'm very careful about  --  Only the quite harmless things , fennel and barberry and milkwort and things like  --  Some of them are hard to grow in this climate , like the marsh plants , any of those that need so much water  --  but I  --  Why , I never use any of those that could be  --  " " We 'd just like to know , Mrs. Thirkettle , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any of your  --  er  --  remedies ? Took any of them ? " She stared at him , her lips working . " I never use any of the dangerous ones . I 've read a lot about it , at the library . I know about the ones can be dangerous . Why , you can look , out back . My little garden . There are n't any of those . I never  --  And , besides , I had n't seen Eliza since  --  since last Sunday . When we all met here as usual  --  for lunch and a little talk . Not since then . She had the store , you know , she had to be there . "  | " She 'd never asked for any of your remedies ? " Mrs. Thirkettle was still staring at him , maybe at the mere size of him in her small living room  --  the big sandy homicide cop in her room . She was shocked , frightened , horrified ; she shot a rapid glance from him to Detective Grace , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . Never . If you  --  if you 've been asking around about Eliza , you 'll have found out that she  --  she did n't believe in medicine of any sort , she never took anything , even aspirin , or went to doctors . She thought I was  --  very foolish , believing the old  --  old cures and herbs and all  --  Of course she never asked me for anything . She talked so much about not believing in it , she would n't have even if she 'd suddenlywanted to ! No . And you can look  --  I never use anything that could be dangerous  --  " They looked . Her neat square little back yard was divided into plots and beds of greenery . Hackett had foresightedlybrought along the book Dr. Bainbridge had checked out of the library ; they looked and peered and saw nothing resembling the leggy green plant labeled Digitalispurpurea . " But we 're neither of us botanists , " said Grace . " I would n't like to swear . " " A nice woman , " said Hackett . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Look , it says the thing gets about five feet tall . Nothing here that big except the hibiscusagainst the house  --  hibiscus I do know . " " Ask the lab boys to take a look ? They do seem to know everything . " " Oh , hell , " said Hackett . " Let 's go see what they 've gotat the store . And what , if anything , George has turned up . " Mrs. Thirkettle watched them leave . One corner of theP78cotton-lace curtain at the living-room window was slightly twitched back as they walked down the drive to the red Barracuda . Alison had done her best , very likely , but Mendoza had showed up at ten o'clock , dapper as always . Hackett and Grace found him outside the secondhand store with Higginsand a scrawny aged woman and the portly Mr. Max Wolf from the pawnshop down the block . Mendoza was saying , " Mrs. Stepp , if you saw Mrs. McCannthat morning  --  " " Did n't . Not at all . Swear on the Bible . Times I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do . She was a bitch anyways . " She gave him an evil smile . " Now , Mrs. Stepp , " said Wolf placatingly . Mendoza eyed them exasperatedly and beckoned Hackettaside . " So what 've you got ? " P79Hackett told him . " A great big nothing . Thirkettle says she had n't seen McCann since last Sunday . And we could n't spot anything around the place that looked like this foxglove . How 'd you get away from Alison ? " " I 'm all right , " said Mendoza irritably . " Just the remnantsof a headache . I said I ought to go to Mrs. Palliser 's funeral , and she thought so too . I think marriage is turning me conventional . " " Nothing could . Suppose I ought to too . When is it ? " " One o'clock , Church of the Recessional . " " And who 's your girl friend ? " Mendoza grinned . " Lives in the apartment over the store . Gladys , so help me , Stepp . A character . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Er  --  Lieutenant  --  " Wolf took a hesitant step toward them , Mrs. Stepp behind him , still wearing her sinister smile . " There 's maybe something I should  --  I mean , I do n't take it in yet , you saying Mrs. McCann got poisoned  --  it was n't natural  --  never crossed my mind  --  but if that 's so  --  " " She was a bitch and a miser , " said Mrs. Stepp emphatically . Mrs. Stepp was a little scrawny old woman , easily in the seventies and maybe older , stooped and hook-nosed and remarkably reminiscent of a conventional portrayal of any of the witches in Macbeth . Her ancient , much-mended cotton house dress needed renewed mending , and she wore over it a man 's old sweater ; her shoes were grimy tennis sneakers , worn without stockings . " God hates a miser , " she remarked . " Says right in the Bible  --  lay not up thy treasurewhere moth and rust doth corrupt . She was a hard , selfish woman . And a hypocrite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Stepp ? " asked Mendoza . " I was at home early , minding my own business . I 've lived in this apartment for over twenty years . I did n't see the woman that day and nobody can prove I did . Then I went out and I did n't come back till along in the afternoon , and Mr. Wolf 's standing in the door of his place and he tells me she 's dead . Heart attack or something , he says . And I said good riddance and that 's all I can tell you . Excepther soul 's gone straight to hell . " Hackett and Higgins exchanged a glance . Higgins sighed . Mendoza opened his mouth to ask another question , and one of the lab men stuck his head out the door of the secondhand store and said , " Oh , Lieutenant . Somethingyou 'll be interested in . " " Excuse us , Mr. Wolf . I 'll talk with you later , " said Mendoza . They all went into the store.  |p81The  lab man was Duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to disappoint you , " he said . " So far no poison . Exotic or otherwise . " The mobile lab unit was standing at the curb outside ; they could conduct on-thespottests . " God , what a collection of junk ! Take us a month of Sundays to do a thorough job , but we 're concentrating on that back room , all this "  --  he waved a hand at the piled-up secondhand goods  --  " is just merchandise ; not much hope there 's anything relevant . And there 's not much out of the ordinary back there . Seems she kept the wherewithal to fix herself a little lunch there , and judging by the half loaf of bread and the cheese she brought that fresh every day or two . Maybe from home or stopped somewhereon her way to open up . There 's a glass standing on the shelf over the sink  --  used , but just for water . We tested that . Nothing in it . Her prints on it and nobody else 's . No milk or anything else to drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture apart  --  old armchair , old Army cot , desk , and that 's about it . A ledger of sorts in the desk , she was n't very businesslike "  --  he grinned  --  " it looks like . Just notes of what she sold for what . And then a while ago Scarne happened to notice that one of the floor boards looked a little loose and  --  well , I think you 'll be interested . " He was leading them up the gloomy store to the small partitioned-off room where Eliza McCann had spent so many hours of her life . He bent and indicated a dark line in the rear corner of the little place , behind the desk . " Here . " He raised it up with his pocket knife and a whole section of the wide old pine planking lifted readily , a piece about ten by four inches : lifted right out . Duke held it out , undermost side toward Mendoza . " Just for fun I put it back the way it was . It 's all been printed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ esto ? " said Mendoza , and took the board . Care/fully taped to the underside of it was a plastic bag of the waterproof type in which frozen food was packaged ; it was fastened to the board with Scotch tape , and when that was pulled off the bag was carefully folded around several little booklets . Bankbooks . Dumbly Mendoza looked at the first one . Security-First National Bank , Seventh and Broadway . Savings account : $6,400 . Eliza Ann McCann . He handed it to Hackett and opened the next . Fidelity Federal Savings . Eliza A. McCann : $4,300 . " For God 's sake ! " said Ilackett in naked astonishment . The third one was from the Bank of America . A little over $3,000 . Coast Federal Savings : slightly more than $2,000 . The California Bank : just over $8,000 . The last item was a thick manila envelope . Mendoza slid the flap open and drew out some legal-looking papers folded together . He unfolded them. " lSanta Maria ! For God 's sake  --  no cabe duda , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! George , go get Wolf , pronto . Who would have  --  " He thrust the papers at Hackett . They were the legal deeds to this entire block of business and rental property  --  one whole block of Los Angeles Street . Nine ground-floor shop rentals and apartments above . The legal owner was Eliza A. McCann . " For the love of  --  " said Hackett . " Well , well , " said Grace amusedly . " I did say she seemed to be the practical one of the family . Who would have expected that , though ? And not even a mortgage . Just fancy that . " Higgins came back with Wolf , who was looking uneasy . " And did you know anything about this ? " asked Mendoza , displaying the deed . " If you mean did I know she owned this whole block ,  |p83well  , naturally , I did , " said Wolf , looking more uneasy . " I was just going to tell you , sir , just now . Because when everybody thought she 'd died of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what difference did it make ? But then you come around asking questions again and saying she was poisoned , my God , like Dragnet or something , Mrs. McCann , and I get thinking and I do n't know what businessarrangements she had but I do know she 's a damn sharp businesswoman and money , it can cause a lotta trouble . My God , yes . Some people , they 'll do anything for money . And I do n't know that you know  --  I mean I do know she was a secretive old lady . It 's a funny thing , " said Wolf , " but women like her , do I know why , are like that . Well , sure I knew about it . My God , she was my landlady , rent I paid her  --  for my store and for the apartment upstairswhere we live . Me and my wife . " " But , my God , " said Higgins , looking at the bankbooks , " how could she ? The way we got it , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or none to count . Lived hand to mouth ever since . I do n't  --  " " I do n't guess you 'd remember much about the depression , " said Wolf sadly . " Me , I never had enough ahead to invest , but anybody knows investments 'll tell you , real estate . It 's always the first thing to drop , depression times , and first to come back , good times . And , brother , did it drop in the thirties . Brother . I do n't know , but I 'd have a little guess maybe she picked up this whole block for around five thousand , not over seventy-five hundred anyways . Payments about twenty a month and everything figuredin . I do know old man Reed , he owned it then , he did n't own it clear , and he was sickenin ' along about then , needed money bad  --  died o ' cancer , he did , thirty-four or thirty-five  --  and he was likely glad to get the cash , hand the papers over to a bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why , my God , even down here it 'd be worth  --  there are what ?  --  nine stores and  --  " " Nine apartments over , " said Wolf sadly . " Yeah , I know . I do n't know what anybody else 's paying , on accounta some of the apartments are smaller'n mine and some of the stores bigger  --  hers , and the appliance store , and the drugstoreon the corner  --  but I 'm payin ' now fifty for the store and forty for the apartment . Acourse it 's a five-room apart-ment . " Mendoza started to laugh . " Talk about the female of the species ! But she had thirty-five years to do it in , of course . Paid off the mortgage twenty and thirty bucks a crack  --  and living hand to mouth to do it . And I 'll take a bet that nobody else knew about it  --  in the family . And sitting on the take all these years  --  " " Still living hand to mouth , " Hackett pointed out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculation she was taking in  --  now the property 's clear  --  something like nine hundred a month  --  and they do n't even have a telephone in that hotel ! " " Is that so ? " said Wolf . " Well , I did n't know one thing about her family , or not much  --  only the little she let out  --  thirty-five years , imagine  --  but some people are like that . I ca n't say I 'm surprised . Guess that old witch 's right , calling her a miser . They do get like that . " " Sitting on it , yes , " said Mendoza thoughtfully . " For various reasons . To start with , still scrimping and saving to make the payments . And when there started to be profits , still squirreling it away in case of a rainy day and also not letting the family know a damn thing about it because , as she 'd know , that bunch would start to throw her hardearnedmoney around . And one thing that emerges is thatp85any little generosity seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes . And then  --  " He fell silent . " Well , when you come to think , " said Grace , " somebody in the family  --  great-grandfather , maybe  --  had to make the money they lost originally . Our Eliza seems to have been the one to inherit the touch . " Mendoza said , " Thanks very much , Mr. Wolf  --  if that 's all you can tell us  --  " Wolf shrugged . " I did n't know her good . All business , she was , the whole thirty-five years . Good morning , Mr. Wolf , maybe , when I 'm standing at the door when she comes past . Thank you , and the receipt , when I pay the rent . And that 's it . For that woman I felt sorry , gentlemen . " His long sad face suddenly warmed with a smile . " Such things some people still think about us Jews . Moneygrubbers . They should read the Talmud maybe , where itsays He that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a good wife , we got two good children , thanks to God , and now their kids coming . For this woman McCann I feel pity  --  she got nothing . Nothing but that . " And he nodded at the books and papers in Mendoza 's hands . " In a bankbook there 's no love , gentlemen . Nothing you get to keep for good , all your life for sure , and it do n't leave you when you die either . Nobody can put that in the bank . " He walked away down to the front door and out . Mendoza looked at the bankbooks . " Desnudo naci , desnudohallo  --  ni pierdo , ni gano . Naked we come and go , so the proverb says . I think I feel sorry for Eliza too . But  --  " " Yes , I thought of that too , " said Hackett . " Depending on when exactly she got the mortgage paid off , does that represent all the profits ? Was she putting money somewhere else ? Stock ? And I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessed thing about this . And had she made a will ? " " And , " said Higgins , " had some of the family just maybe found out ? " " And , " said Grace dreamily , " figured Eliza was being damn selfish with her fortune and maybe deserved whatevershe got ? " " All points to think about , " said Mendoza . " And giving us places to look . Duke , you go over this place with the proverbial fine-tooth comb . If she had other caches , maybe for a safety-deposit key or investment papers , I want to know . Art , you chase down to this escrow office and find out chapter and verse about the real-estate deal , whether a lawyer was involved . And let 's ask at all the banks  --  most of those have investment counselors , though I think our Eliza relied on her native common sense  --  see what they know about her , anyway . And we 're going to look at everybody in that damned hotel very close  --  check back on them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aye , sir ? " " You 're going over her room there with another finetoothcomb . I do n't think you 'll find anything , I think she took great care not to leave anything revealing around there where anybody in her loving family  --  or anybody else  --  might find it . But , look . " Mendoza glanced at his watch . " I 'll run back to the office , see if anything 's in from Ossining , and then if I want to make that funeral  --  O.K. , I 'll see you . You know the routine . " Outside , he started down the block to where he 'd left the Ferrari . Our Eliza , he thought . Another one like his grandfather , the old ogre on the hearth . Far back as he could remember , screaming about the four-dollar gas bill , grudging the fifty cents for resoling the school shoes : and then , after he died , all those safety-deposit boxes turn/ing up , the gilt-edged stock , the real estate . A gambler , the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but anothermiser . In a bankbook there 's no love , gentlemen . No . That he had found out too : maybe late , but he had found it out . And , money or no , he was safe : unlocking the Ferrari , he had that sudden odd thought . He was safe forever , because there were Alison and the twins at home in the house on Kayo Grande Avenue . " You mark my words . " He looked up from the car door . Mrs. Stepp stood there beside him , wearing her crooked grin . " God hates a miser . She was a wicked woman , not sparing of the poor and the orphan , and her soul went straight to hell-fire and brimstone . " " Possibly so , " said Mendoza diplomatically , and slid under the wheel . Ossining had been commendably prompt in replying to the request for information . Benjamin Joseph Kelly had been convicted on a homicidecharge when he was nineteen , back in 1914 . He and another kid had attempted to hold up a saloon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bartender had showed fight . A cop had dropped in by chance during the fight  --  one Robert Emmet Muldoon  --  and a shot had been fired  --  by Kelly , the one with the gun  --  which had unfortunatelykilled Muldoon . Place of occurrence : The Bowery , New York . Both Kelly and his pal had been handed life sentences . Even in 1914 cops had n't liked cops ' getting killed . Apparently they 'd thrown the key away on Ben ; he had n't got paroled until 1954 . It could be guessed , from the terse teletype , on account of his early prison record : obstreperous , a troublemaker , a fighter . Later he seemed to have settled down . And they finally let him out . He'dp88got official permission to come to California on the plea that he had a brother here . Kelly was now off parole . Well . That really said nothing at all . And while no brief was to be held for cop-killers , apparently it had been a little scuffle started with no murderous intentions  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of a man 's lifeBut between that and mixing up a lethal dose of homemadepoison a great gulf was fixed . Farrell told him there 'd been another D.O.A.  --  traffic accident . Another drunk walking off the curb against the light . " No loss , " said Mendoza absently , and went on to get an early lunch and attend Sergeant Palliser 's mother 's funeral . Landers and Piggott had split up all the places they had to cover . About now Landers had got to the Union Station and Piggott to the Continental Bus Lines office in Inglewood . The first place Landers had checked , of course , was the Greyhound office on Spring Street . They were very helpful . Several buses had arrived at that station , the official L.A. terminus , between two and three-thirty P.M. on March third . There had been an interstate bus starting from Portland , Oregon ; a bus from San Francisco ; a bus from Sacramento ; a cross-country bus from Chicago ; and of course every single one of them had made many stops en @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union Station he was offered five trains that had arrived within those times  --  from Chicago , San Francisco ( coast route ) , Seattle , San Diego and San Francisco ( inland route ) . As to checking up on which conductors had been on duty  --  a little chore , said the official , and inp89any case the conductors did n't have occasion to notice everybody in the train . God only knew , thought Landers , what Piggott was getting . It would be one hell of a lot easier to write it off as suicide . Obvious suicide . Wait until some worried relative reported Mary Brown missing and the routine inquiries were set in motion , when L.A. Homicide could teletype back to wherever : Here 's what happened to her . Only , of course , L.A. Homicide did n't operate that way . The L.A.P.D. liked to keep up its reputation of being the smartest force there was : a thing looked fishy , they kept working it until it came apart and the truth showed . He thanked the official , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and started for the airport . Hackett , Higgins and Grace descended on the Celtic Hotel at eleven-thirty . Not everybody was at home , but to those that were they started to give the full treatment . One by one , they conducted the questioning in depth . They wanted to know backgrounds , and how long all of them had lived there , and how well had they known Mrs. McCann , and had they ever heard her mention a will  --  investments  --  property ? And so on and so on . Detective Grace  --  even Detective Grace  --  reduced Miss Manning to tears within half an hour , and Karl Svenson snarled at them ill-temperedly , and Ben stolidly and patientlyanswered all the questions . They invaded the domainof an irritated Henry , and were nervously fawned on by Oscar , and denounced as a pack of fools by Jane . But they got some answers ; and when they came to sort them out , something might emerge . They broke for lunch and came back and asked more questions . P90Among the questions , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have you ever seen such a plant as this , et cetera , " and Hackett had passed the little book , Herbs of Healing , to Higgins at one point . It was all rather hectic  --  the McLaughlins and their roomers being what they were  --  and at some time past three o'clock , when they called a halt and headed back for base , they went tiredly down to Hackett 's blinding-scarlet Barracuda and climbed in and Hackett started the engine . And he said , " Oh , you got that book , George ? I seem to remember  --  " " I have n't got it , " said Higgins . " I had  --  let 's see , we were in Henry 's room a while ago  --  I think I put it down on the table there , meant to give it back to you but  --  " " Oh , hell , " said Hackett . " I 'll go and fetch it , " said Grace . " Wo n't be a minute . " He got out of the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was a big row going on between Henry and Oscar . " Going at it hammer and tongs , and the monkey climbing up the curtains and chattering at them and the Manning woman wringing her hands in the middle of the lobby and wishing Albert would come and take her away . " " What a crowd , " said Hackett , and let in the clutch.  |p91They  found Mendoza leaning back in his desk chair talking to Glasser , who was perched on a corner of the  --  as usual  --  inhumanly tidy desk . " So there 's no blood or anything on the car , we chase down the kid who brought it in and he 's a seventeen-year-old going to Pasadena High School and he has n't been driving long and rammed it into a tree , that 's all . I do n't know , Lieutenant , I kind of go along with Higgins , the only hope we 've got of getting the car that killed Cohen is to come up with the right plate number . The car need n't have been damaged much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our hit-run joker runs home and cleans the car himself in the privacy of his garage  --  that 's that . " " You do any looking on the idea that it was deliberate ? " asked Mendoza . " Hello , boys . Come in and join us. "  |p92Glasser  looked derisive . " That 's silly . I looked around . Cohen had a good rep , both personally and with us . Family man . Two grown-up kids . He 'd had no trouble of any kind with anybody lately that anybody knew about . I tell you this plate-number thing 's the one to follow up . The young fellow gave us that number looks fairly sharp  --  L.A.C.C. student , third year . He does wear glasses , and he was looking at the plate from the curb , not a direct view . I still think if we figure all the possible mistakes he could have made  --  Anyway , I thought up a few more the D.M.V. 's checking out . " " And what have you happy gents brought in ? " asked Mendoza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desk . " Well , a lot of facts and figures and times , " said Hackett , taking out his notebook . " If it 's worth anything . " Higgins dragged up another chair and Grace fetched a third from the anteroom . " Thanks for the kind words , Henry , I do n't see any other way to come up with that driver either , " said Higgins . " The D.M.V. come through with any more makes yet ? " " Had n't a while ago . I 'll see if anything 's come in . " Glasser drifted out . " LA ttencidn ! This McCann thing . What 'd you get ? " " I 'll open the ball , " said Hackett . " We divided ' em up . Oscar . He saw her on Wednesday morning , but just for a minute  --  she 'd already finished breakfast . Manning  --  her first name is Vera , by the way  --  agrees , if that 's worth anything . Though she seems competent enough some ways  --  does all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lists . We did find out a good deal about the householdand various arrangements . All kind of funny . By all that emerges , the McLaughlins have been happily putteringaround their backwater for the last thirty-five years orp93so without the vaguest realization that the depression 's over or times changed . If you 'll believe me , they charge the Rialto woman four dollars a week for her room . Karl Svensonpays three  --  it 's a smaller room  --  and fifty cents a month for the electricity . The Lightfoot female  --  Florence Lightfoot  --  pays three-fifty . The Allenby creature , who 's another one not all there , pays two bucks for a cubbyhole off a sort of pantry beside the kitchen . Mrs. Rialto and Mrs. Lightfoot pay fifty cents a month for the use of one of the refrigerators in the kitchen and the stove . Svenson has his own refrigerator and a hot plate in his room . Nobody seems to know how Allenby feels herself , she does n't use the kitchen except to get water . " " There 's one bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You should see them . Circa nineteen ten . These sevenfootbathtubs  --  you could drown in one  --  all encased in the finest quality black walnut . And fancy chains on the toilets . " " I can imagine , " said Mendoza . " Talk about arrangements , " said Hackett . " Well , they 're all queer people  --  I suppose it 's only natural . They had a regular time schedule set up . Mrs. Rialto and Mrs. Lightfoot ca n't use the kitchen in the morning until after nine o'clock , so they do n't generally at all ; both have hot plates in their rooms . The McLaughlins , which includes Manning , always had dinner between six and seven , so Rialto and Lightfoot ca n't use the kitchen till after seventhirty . There 's a big table , the McLaughlins eat there . Separately . Svenson keeps pretty much to himself . He  --  " " Backgrounds ? " said Mendoza plaintively . " Oh , we got this and that .. Svenson was a wire walker and aerialist for forty years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was with the Flying Adriennes , Ringling Brothers , awhile . About ten years ago he took a bad fall , brokep94his back . Spent most of his savings on medical bills . He lives on the pension now . He can get around on crutches , take care of himself after a fashion . He tells us he was in his room all day on Wednesday , did n't lay eyes on any of the McLaughlins . What was he doing all day ? Working on his book : he 's writing his memoirs . " " No corroboration ? " " What do you think ? He 's an unsociable cuss and , anyway , what Oscar told you about all of them liking their privacy was the understatement of the month . Mrs. Rialto and Mrs. Lightfoot have rooms across the hall from each other , but the rest of ' em seem to have got as far away from each other as possible , and in that old barracks of a place that 's far enough . Henry lives in his big room off the lobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very touchy about anybody using it but him . Svenson is in a room at the back on the ground floor . Rialto and Lightfoot a dozen rooms down the hall on the second floor . Oscar sleeps way up on the fourth floor  --  tittered and said the air 's better up there . Jane is at the very back of the third floor . Manning has a room over at the opposite side of the ground floor from Henry , which I 'd guess used to be the manager 's office . Ben sleeps out in what used to be the stable , it runs back of the hotel and also back of the little place beside it where Oscar the friendly undertaker still hopes for business . Ben pays two dollars a week , gets it cheaper because he takes care of Gertrude . They 're having trouble milking her , " added Hackett . " Ellie always did that . " " Vaya historia . What 's Ben living on ? He did n't get a pension from Sing Sing . " " No , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know how he managed before he established residency , but he 's now on the pension . So is Mrs. Lightfoot . So isp95Miss Allenby . Mrs. Rialto is n't old enough to qualify , she has a job of sorts but only works part time because she also is writing a book  --  about astrology . You can gather they all drifted to that place because they 're all living on practically nothing . Somebody told somebody else about the McLaughlins and their cheap rooms , and the roomers drifted in . They 've had  --  Oscar says  --  a lot of people at various times . Some pensioners . He says vaguely , oh , some of them died or went to the hospital and so on . They usuallyhave a few more than they do now . " " I told you , " said Grace . " Only one of the family with her head screwed on the right way was our Eliza . And why she let Oscar go on charging those low rents  --  " " Well , the hotel belongs jointly to Oscar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Higgins , " when , as we know now , she was sitting on a small fortune all her own , it gave her some private laughs to see Oscar and I-Ienry taking in peanuts when they could have been getting more . " " That sounds like what we know of Eliza , " agreed Mendoza . " Who did see her Wednesday morning ? " " Nobody but Oscar , Henry and Manning  --  according to them . Eliza did fix breakfast for Jane  --  who does n't often come downstairs , though she can , she 's not all that crippled . Manning says vaguely that ' Jane snoops around all the rooms up there , ' which could mean she prowls that floor at least . Anyway , Manning carried the tray up to Jane while Eliza was getting her own breakfast . Then Eliza went out to milk the goat  --  which was in a pen in the stableyard . But Ben says he did n't see her  --  had n't got up yet . " " Oh , " said Mendoza . " By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to live with a brother . Where 's the brother ? " " Dead . That 's how he landed at the Celtic Hotel , " saidp96Grace . " Brother was living there . Mrs. Lightfoot , who 's a giddy old girl all simpering giggles , heard about the hotel from a woman she got talking to in Pershing Square . She 's lived there only about three months . Mrs. Rialto 's been there three , four years , heard about it from Miss Manning 's sister , who evidently shoved the old lady off on Eliza and glad to be rid of her . Well , I can see she 'd be a little embarrassing to have around . Sister paid Eliza forty a month for her . Nobody remembers how long Allenby 's been there or how she happened to come . " " Oh , " said Mendoza . " Relationships with Eliza ? " " They all talked , but nothing much emerged , " said Higgins . " That is a bunch of zanies . It did come out that Eliza kept pretty much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  which figures . Duke and Scarne just came in as we were leaving  --  started looking at her room . Which was on the third floor  --  where Percy sleeps too , but about as far away as he can get . We just had a look : mainly what 's in her room is books . Books and books . A lot of paperbacks , a lot of old books half falling apart . Looks as if she brought home every book that ever came into the store . By what they all said , she was n't very sociable either . Usually had breakfast alone or with Manning , milked the goat , went off to the store . Came home at six o'clock , fixed her own dinner and Manning 's with Manning 's help . Sometimes Oscar or Henry would be in the kitchen then too , getting their dinners  --  which they did separately . Zany , " said Higgins . " My God . Living on cheese sandwiches and soup . She gave Manning fifteen bucks a week to do the marketing  --  madeout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fifteen  --  " " I 'm telling you . Fifteen per . That 's for Eliza and Manning . Sometimes , says Manning , she 'd run out before the end of the week , so Eliza would give her another four orp97five . Oscar and Henry split the room rent , which comes to eighty-two-fifty a month ; Percy pays three bucks a week too . The remittance man . They do their own marketing . Henry makes some extra off his embroidery . " " Caray , " said Mendoza , thinking of the normal grocery bills Alison reported . " It would n't run to much more than cheese sandwiches . You 'd think they 'd have realized , with today 's prices  --  " " I 'm telling you . They do n't know what year it is . Crazy . Anyway , they say that after Eliza finished her dinner and washed the dishes , she went straight up to her room . And on Sundays , down to have breakfast , upstairs again until she left at twelve o'clock sharp for this little lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner at six , and that was that . And Henry seems to spend most of his time in his room . How Oscar occupies himself all day is anybody 's guess  --  waiting for customers , maybe . Anyway , there was n't much fraternizing . " " What it comes down to , " said Grace , " in that place anybody could have seen her that morning , privately , and nobody else know about it . As long as they knew where her room was  --  and everybody did , naturally , except Lightfoot , who has n't been there long . There 's back stairs as well as front . Somebody who knew her regular hours could have been up there before she came down that morning . Ben could also have seen her when she went to milk Gertrude . " " I really should tell the Board of Health about Gertrude , " said Mendoza absently . " Yes . But look  --  it 's all very well for Bainbridge to say this foxglove concoction could have been flavored or mixed with a soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easiest thing in the world to approach our Eliza with an ingratiating smile and offer her a Coke at seven o'clock in the morning . Either whilep98she was getting dressed or while she was milking Gertrude . For anybody . Not natural . " " There is that , " said Hackett . " So is it more likely she had it in the store ? Later ? Bainbridge said either time was possible . We 'll ask some more  --  find out about any regular customers who might know  --  and these women she had her Sunday lunches with , who might also know if she was in the habit of drinking a Coke or something in the middle of the morning . There 's that drugstore down the street . But  --  " " So she kept herself to herself , " said Mendoza . " Yes . I get the impression she did n't think much of the rest of her family . Mmh  --  feckless as they are . I 'm wondering hard whether she made a will . And , if she did , what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn up anything else at the store . " " And I 'm now wondering something else , " said Mendozasuddenly . " Nothing else ? ; Quid ! What about Uncle ? Greedy Uncle in Washington ? By the deed , she got that property clear of encumbrances in nineteen fifty-two . O.K. At the least , she 's cleared a profit of around eleven thousanda year since then , and that 's not counting in whatever net she made from the store . I 'll just bet you that our canny Eliza never paid a dime of income tax on it . She might just get away with it , you know . They spot-check , but they do n't as a rule bother with the little fish  --  what look like the very little fish from places like Los Angeles Street . The only actual record there 'd be would be the rents reported by her tenants on their tax returns  --  and the bank records , of course . She could n't get out of the property tax  --  deed in her name  --  but I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Which says what ? " asked Hackett . " Nothing really . Except that if she did n't make a will ,  |p99and  her loving family comes in for the small fortune , and the whole business has to go through escrow and all the other legal bit to get it transferred , Dios , these happy-goluckyMcLaughlins are going to be in trouble with Uncle ! " said Mendoza amusedly . " Oh , brother , are you right , " said Higgins , and started to laugh . " And if I read Eliza right "  --  Grace grinned  --  " could be she just planned it that way . " " Which does n't get us any farther toward finding out who handed her the homemade poison , " said Hackett . " For what reason . " " Well , you know , " said Grace , " these McLaughlins . All of ' em  --  Oscar and Henry and Jane . And we do n't want to overlook the ones that are n't here any more . Moved away . Somewhere . What 'd the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Earl . She dies without a will , they come in for the whole bit . If the rest of ' em are anything like those we 've met , a seven-way split in twenty or thirty G 's might look like Fort Knox to them . " " What 's left in Fort Knox ? " asked Mendoza sardonically . " So ? " " So , say one of ' em had found out about it  --  we know both Oscar and Percy helped her at the store sometimes , and they could have got it from Wolf or one of the other tenants  --  is it likely that one of that bunch would think maybe she 'd made a will leaving it all to the Red Cross  --  or have any notion about Uncle and his tax spirals or even inheritance tax ? Just doin ' what comes naturally  --  the happy thought , if Ellie should die , we 'd all inherit . I supposethey would know that much ? " added Grace doubtfully . " Which is also a thought , " agreed Mendoza . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was very far from a fool , Jase , ifp100she was only elementarily shrewd . It would n't have been natural for any of that crowd to offer her any kind of drink at that hour in the morning  --  " He stopped . " Mmh-hmm , " said Hackett dryly . " He 's got there . We talked this over before . So just maybe little Oscar bustled into the store around nine A.M. , on his way back from getting the paint , and said , My , it 's turned warm , has n't it , I just thought you 'd enjoy a Coke , or some nice orangeade just off the ice  --  and produced the bottles . Hers spiked beforehand . Or Henry . Or even Percy Cantwell , who I understand is a cousin . " " Yes , " said Mendoza thoughtfully , " yes . It 's possible . And helpfully rinsed out the glasses afterward . There was a second , unused glass in the cupboard there . " " We gathered sometimes Manning came down to the store with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from market . " " Both Percy and Oscar , " said Hackett , " are familiar with the store . She acquired stock in a couple of ways  --  bought it piecemeal from people coming in , took it on consignmentat a twenty-per-cent cut , and sometimes she 'd dicker for a whole houseful of furniture . Some old person dying and no family , or family selling off the bits and pieces . And both Oscar and Percy had helped her move merchandise  --  Percy 's the only one of the bunch with a driver 's license , and a few times he 'd rented a pickup truck  --  Eliza providing the money  --  and carted stuff to the store . It 'd be fairly natural for either of ' em to drop in that way . Or for Manning . " " Conforme . But not so easy for either of them to concoctthe homemade poison ? I gather you need a stove at least  --  and where , boys , just where  --  which is the ultimate question  --  down here in the middle of the neon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fox-glove ? " Hackett shrugged . That was a question all right . " And knew how to brew the fatal dose ? " added Grace . Which was another question . " What are Percy 's household arrangements ? " asked Mendoza . " He does n't seem to have any , " said Higgins gloomily . " He gets sent a hundred bucks a month by some third cousinor somebody in England . We got that out of him finally . He pays the McLaughlins twelve bucks a month for his room . He eats all his meals out  --  I 'd have a guess , hamburgersand so on  --  and spends most of his time , he says , in the local pub , ' which turns out to be Sam 's Bar and Grill on North Spring . " " iVaya ! " " But , Lieutenant , " said Grace softly , " well , I read a lot and a little something sort of came to me about Percy . For whatever it 's worth . This and that we got out of him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Place called Wroxton , in the county of Oxfordshire . And you know England  --  well , it 's easy to say backward people , the countrypeople there  --  it 's not that exactly  --  they do n't take to changing ideas to any extent . And in a place like that I 'd take a small bet you 'd find a few old people who know something about the old-time remedies , same like Tabitha Thirkettle  --  and what she calls the ones that can be dangerous , too . " Mendoza looked at him . " You do think , do n't you ? What a business . Up in the air you can say . That is a thought , Jase . " Glasser came back into the office . " Report in from the D.M.V. , " he said to Higgins . " Your latest brain wavep102turned up a Baptist preacher in San Diego , a chiropractor in Eureka , and one that could just be  --  fellow called AlfredClark in Pasadena . At least he 's local . Car 's a **26;7364;TOOLONG . " Higgins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . I ca n't say I care a tinker 's dam who mixed up the brew for Eliza . Nothing to choose among that bunch . " He charged out with Glasser in tow . Tom Landers , at five-thirty that Saturday afternoon , was busy on the phone , checking back with all the helpful officialsfor all the checked-out names of the bus drivers , conductors , and stewardesses . Piggott had n't come back yet . The officials fired names at him and information . This bus driver was on his way to Chicago , would n't be back until Tuesday . That one lived in Chatsworth . This one was starting a run from San Diego , due in at midnight . This conductor was on the Portland run , not due back until Monday . This stewardess was in New York , due in at the airport at one-fifteen Sunday but scheduled to staff the four-fifteen to Miami . And so on . Landers swore . And ten to one the whole damn thing was a mare 's nest . Honest-to-God suicide . On the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very small amount of alcohol in the stomach . So had the sleeping pills been in a little drink , maybe , so she had n't known what she was drinking ? Put in the drink by the boy friend or whoever ?

Landers swore some more . The deadly routine . There was one bus driver who was off duty until Monday ; thep103address was in Hollywood . Landers started to dial the phone number . Go see him tonight , maybe , show him the picture ( post-mortem ) of Mary Brown , and askAt ten minutes to six Scarne sauntered into Mendoza 's office and tossed a legal-sized envelope onto the desk . " We are thorough , " he said . " Try to be . About five thousand books in that damned room , but we riffled through every one . Thorough  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the four thousandth nine hundredth and ninetieth  --  copy of Bartlett 's Quotations . " " iDe veras ? " Mendoza picked it up . Opened the long manila envelope . " i Que mono ! " The long legal-sized folded single sheet , with its blue covering sheet , was headed Last Will and Testament . He skimmed through it rapidly . It had been drawn up  --  a very simple will  --  by one Adam Carson , attorney-atlaw , and signed by Eliza A. McCann and witnessed by two names strange to the case  --  lawyer 's clerks probably . It bequeathed all Eliza McCann 's property to be evenly divided among three persons : Tabitha Thirkettle , Ida Mae Glidden , and Marcia Hunt . Addresses were appended . " How extremely interesting indeed , " said Mendoza , his long nose twitching.  |p104Alfred  Clark , when Higgins and Glasser located him , turned out to be most depressingly unlikely to have driven the hit-and-run car which had killed Patrolman Harry Cohen . They found Alfred Clark at home , which was a nicely kept frame bungalow in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring Saturday afternoon , he was out in the back yard playing ball with his two kids , Roy , aged eleven , and Ruth , aged nine . Mrs. Clark led them there looking puzzled ; she was a pretty young woman , neatly dressed . " Wednesday morning ? " said Alfred Clark . " Well , I 'd have to  --  The car ? You say you 're police ? What on earthp105have I done ? " He was a man about thirty-five , his dark hair receding ; he had a pleasantly open and friendly face if he was n't exactly handsome . The kids came up , interested , and Higgins for once was discouraged by kids who liked cops  --  the boy saying earnestly he 'd like to be a cop when he grew up , the girl just staring with wondering big eyes . Rather obviously , a man who raised his kids to admire cops would n't be a man who 'd inadvertently run down a traffic officer and then speed away . They looked at the car , whose plate number was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was just a try , " said Glasser . " Wednesday morning , " Clark was saying . " Where was I  --  Oh , yes , of course . " And his face cleared . " I was with Mr. Dowd in his office . About eleven o'clock . You see , I 've got my own business  --  hardware  --  but I 'm rather active in our Y.M.C.A. activities here , and Mr. Dowd was interested in our summer-camp plans , he 's an executive with a local department store , and we hoped he might want to contributesomething , and I took all the papers up to show him . I was with him until about noon . What on earth  --  what 's this all about , gentlemen ? " " Nothing , " said Higgins . " A wild-goose chase . We go on a lot of them , Mr. Clark . Thanks very much , sorry to have bothered you . " He grinned at the kids ; he and Glasserwalked down the drive . " Well , we have to look , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was getting on for six then ; Higgins dropped Glasser back at Headquarters and drove up to his old apartment on Bronson Avenue . About now , he thought , Mary Dwyer would be getting home from work and having to fix dinner . A woman ought to be home with her kids . But the pension did n't start to cover everything ;  |p106she  had to work . They were good kids , Steve and Laura , but these days kids could get in trouble so easy , just a couple of wrong friends  --  and Steve not eleven yet ; he needed a manBut it was really beyond the realm of possibility that Mary Dwyer , who was a very damn good-looking woman , would look twice at George Allen Higgins , with his ugly puss . He looked in the refrigerator , sighed , made himself a highball , and then went out to a restaurant nearby . And over his steak he suddenly took in the sense of what Mr. Alfred Clark had said , and he thought : Y.M.C.A. summer camp . Could he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build a ruse Mary would n't suspect , to get Stevie to camp ? Mr. Clark had seemed like a nice guy . Slightly cheered and trying to think up plausible ideas to put across to Mary , Higgins went home . Providence , he thought . Stevie talking about going to camp this summer ever since Christmas . After all , thought Higgins , he 'd managedabout Laura 's piano lessons , and Mary had n't any suspicion he was paying half the cost . Somehow he 'd get Stevie to summer camp . Undoubtedly Providence had led him to Alfred Clark . On a wild-goose chase . Landers called Mr. John Brady and explained what he wanted  --  all official . Mr. Brady drove buses for the ContinentalBus Company : We Cover the Continent . He had driven a bus from Seattle down the coast to L.A. last Tuesdayand Wednesday and pulled into L.A. at three-fifteen Wednesday afternoon . Mary Brown could have been on his bus . " What say your name is ? " asked Mr. Brady . " Landers , sir , Detective Landers , Headquarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at , say , eight o'clock , if you 'll be home , and  --  " " Any time , " said Brady largely . " Why not now ? I 'm just sittin ' here feelin ' sorry for myself , all alone . Glad to have some company , friend . " " Well  --  " The address was on Detroit Avenue , not so far from where Landers lived ; he might as well see Brady and get it over . The night shift was just coming on . Landers said good night to Farrell , sought his car in the lot and drove up to Hollywood , not without delays at that traffic-ridden hour . He found the address , an old duplex with a velvet-green lawn and manicured flower beds round it ; he found Brady in one side of the duplex , a big bald middle-aged man with friendly eyes who opened the door wide , told him to come in and sit down . " What 'll you drink  --  bourbon or Scotch ? " " Well , nothing , really , I  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You look like you could use a drink . Suppose you ran into some bottleneckson the freeway , up here from downtown . You should try it with a bus full of people yet . Besides , it 's seven o'clock , ai n't you off duty ? " " Well , yes , " said Landers . " Scotch . " " That 's better , " said Brady . " Might 's well be comfortable . " When they were settled with their drinks ( this hypnoticallymild spring weather enervating , you could say : the drink was welcome and warm in Landers ' empty stomach ) Brady looked at the photograph Landers handed him . " Want to know if she rode with me ? That Seattle run , you said ? Yeah . This ai n't such a hot picture . " " Girl was dead , " said Landers . " That so ? Yeah , yeah , I guess I can see that . Poor kid  --  she do n't look over twenty . That 's a damn shame . Somebodyknocked her off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we want to find out who she was if we can . And just maybe somebody did take her off . " Brady shook his head and took a pull at his drink . " Damn shame . Now I 'll tell you the truth , boy . She could 've rode with me , but I ai n't sure . You got things to concentrate on , you 're drivin ' a bus full of people . I tell you how it is , when you take the bus out from here , or Seattle , or Chicago or wherever , the passengers already in you do n't notice . They 've handed over the tickets and got settled . O.K. But now take this Seattle run , f'r instance . There 's stops in Auburn and Sumner and Tacoma and Olympia and Aberdeen and Raymond and Kelso and Kalama and Woodland and , my God , all the way down the coast I would n't like to count the stops  --  all those are before you get across the border into Oregon even  --  and then there 's Portland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , look , anybody can get on the bus at any of those places . See ? And a lot do  --  maybe just for a forty-mile ride , sometimes all the way . " " Yes , " said Landers . " And the faces I see every week  --  who could remember ' em all ? But the people get on like that you are apt to noticejust a little bit more . " " And you think you remember this girl ? " For God 's sake , thought Landers , had he hit the jackpot the first time round ? It could happen . " Now I ai n't goin ' so far as to say that , " said Brady . " No . This ai n't such a hot picture and I could n't anyways be sure  --  for one thing , it 's black and white , no color . But on the other hand "  --  he grinned comfortably at Landers  --  " for all I 'm risin ' fifty and ai n't got no hair , well , you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | " Yes , " said Landers , grinning back . " So it just could 've been this girl I remember gettin ' on , and I ca n't tell you just exactly what stop it was but someplaceafter Eureka , on the way down . Up there . Could 've been Rio Dell , but I kinda got the feeling it was further down , like Willits or Ukiah . Anyways , she got on and she was goin ' all the way to L.A. , she had two suitcases with her . " " Remember anything about those ? " " Not a blessed thing . Just there was two of ' em . I helped her get ' em aboard . A damn pretty girl , about twenty . Brown hair  --  I guess blue eyes . Medium tall and  --  you know  --  quite a figger . Nice girl , you could tell , " said Brady . Which was exactly what that hotel maid had said about Mary Brown . Maybe he had hit the jackpot . He asked Brady what she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty girl getting on and helping her with her suitcases . But this was something : it might be just exactly what they wanted to know . " Thanks very much , Mr. Brady , " said Landers . He finished his drink and stood up . This had taken a while and he was starving to death , but he ought to call in and get the routine started . " We 'll start looking in all those places and see what  --  " " Oh , what 's the rush ? " said Brady . " You want to call your office , there 's the phone , boy . You look hungry to me , and I do hate to eat alone , I got a couple nice thick steaks back in the kitchen , suppose we have another little drink while they 're fixin ' , and then you can tell me all about bein ' a cop on this force while we eat . O.K ? I got a boy on the force up in Bakersfield . " " Oh , " said Landers , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You call in , you want . I 'll start the steaks . That 's right . " Landers reached for the phone . Mendoza did n't often bring cases home with him : the average deadly dull routine of homicide does not make for interesting conversation over the dinner table ; but the offbeatones and the ones that turned out to be tough came home with him because Mendoza had the single-track mind and could n't stop worrying at a thing until he knew the answer . " So there you are , " he said . " It 's wide open . Any of them could have done it . Given the knowledge about the foxglove . And anybody could have found that out by going to the library . And I do wonder whether , in all her collection of books , there happens to be one like that one Bainbridgehanded us . And whether anybody in that place was in the habit of borrowing books from her . But even so , and even granting that there 's any common foxglove to be found somewhere down there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , it 's such a damned roundabout way of  --  " " Well , you might think so , " said Alison , considering . " All sorts of other lethal things rather easily available  --  weed killer and rat poison and so on  --  And of course the first implication that leaps to the eye about that is  --  " " Tabitha Thirkettle , " said Mendoza . " De veras . " They were both comfortably full of dinner ; Mendoza had taken off jacket and tie and was stretched out in the largest armchairwith Bast purring on his lap . Alison was wearing her most fetching topaz housecoat , and her red head gleamed in the soft lamplight ; she had Nefertiti . From a distance there came noises indicative that the twins were resisting bed as usual . El Senor , the miniature lion , lay stretched onp111the carpet between their chairs . " With her little hobby , " said Alison lazily . " The simples . " " But Eliza never took medicine of any kind . I know  --  that says nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , I want to know the hell of a lot more about those three old biddies indeed . For all we know they could have been in it together  --  " " Jumping to conclusions , amado . " " We 'll join them at their regular Sunday get-together tomorrow and ask some pointed questions . Whether any or all of them knew about the will . And where they were last Wednesday and what doing . And I think , just to be thorough , we 'll get a warrant and look through the Thirkettle house . And  --  ; Santa Maria ! " Mendoza exclaimedviolently as Sheba landed on him from behind , digging all claws into his shoulder . " Little monster ! " " But , Luis  --  " Sheba walked down him onto her mother and started to chew Bast 's right ear . Bast remonstrated mildly . " There 's not room for two of you , " said Mendoza . Offended , Bast left him and began to wash El Senor . Sheba settled down , purring . " Livestock , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the reason . For the foxglove . To point so obviously to the Thirkettle woman and her simples . " " I do n't somehow feel that anybody we 've met in this case so far has quite that subtle a mind , my love . " " But you do n't know , " said Alison . " Not really . It is a funny case , all right . And something else occurs to me . . . I ran into that obnoxious Holloway woman in at Bullocks ' this afternoon . I had n't seen her in years . No , you do n't know her . We were in school together once . In Hollywood . One of the brief occasions I was in an American school.  |p112Age  , " said Alison , " is a funny thing too . I hardly ever think of it , but some people  --  Anyway , she 's rather a cat . Sorry , I do n't mean that , cats are at least honest . If egotists . Anyway , first she asked was I married yet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thirteen  --  paragons , of course . And when I said  --  " " What brought this up ? " asked Mendoza . " In a minute . When I said the twins  --  " Master John Luis erupted into the living room at full speed . At eighteen months his speed was impressive . After him , at a slightly more dignified pace , came Mrs. MacTaggart , announcing firmly that it was time for all good little boys to be in bed . " Johnny ! " said Alison . " No ! " announced Master John as firmly , and dived underthe credenza , leaving his pajamas behind on the floor . " Now , Johnny  --  " Mrs. MacTaggart and Alison crouched to haul him out . " Bed , " said Alison . " You know you always go to bed now , come on . " " No , " said Johnny , unwillingly succumbing to superior physical strength . " Now , mo croidhe , " said Mrs. MacTaggart , " you be a good boy now , and we 'll just hop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send you off to sleep . Flow Gently , Sweet Afton '  --  now that 's a nice song to be going off to sleep with  --  " " No me gusta , " said Johnny emphatically . Suddenly restored to amiability , he reached up one hand and patted Alison 's cheek . " Mo croidhe ? " he said doubtfully . Mendoza burst out laughing . " I swear to God , if these kids are getting nothing else it 's a democratic raising . But sooner or later they 're going to have to learn to distinguish one language from another . "   " Off we go ! " said Mrs. MacTaggart . " Well , will you look at that now ! " Miss Teresa had appeared in the hall doorway . Her small person was stark naked except for a pair of woolly slippers . " No afton , " she said . " Bonnie . Si . Bueno . " " Well , now . ' T is The Banks and Braes o ' Bonnie Doon ' the lass wants ? And will Johnny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny . Mrs. MacTaggart bore him out , shepherding Terry before her . " Darlings , " said Alison fondly . " Incipient diplomats , God forbid . All the languages . What were you talking about ? " " Well , it only just occurred to me , Luis . This awful Hollowaywoman . When I said the twins were eighteen months , she said , Goodness , I was lucky to have any , startingso late . As if I 'd been middle-aged or something , when I was only  --  But , anyway , you 've been talking about the McLaughlins and I just suddenly thought : what about the rest of them ? " " Well , what about them ? " " The older brothers and sister . Dorothy ? Well , I do n't know , I just wondered . You said Oscar was at least fiftyfiveand probably older  --  the McCann woman was sixtyfive  --  Henrysomewhere around there and Jane older . And the others were older yet  --  three brothers and a sister . Oscar told you the sister had a job as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd been born quite close together , the older sister would have to be seventy or so at least by now ? It just struck me as a little funny . These other McLaughlins  --  theyounger ones  --  apparently settled into their backwater and just stayed put . Not keeping up with the times . While the older ones evidently found jobs for themselves and got out . Not the way round you 'd expect it . "  |p114Mendoza  considered that . " Well , possibly , but there it is . They 're not  --  mmh  --  expectable people . I think I need a drink . " He got up , putting Sheba down , and she natteredat him . " I just wondered , " said Alison . " And as long as you are , I think I 'll have just a little of that peppermint liqueur . " " Female drinks , " said Mendoza . He went out to the kitchen , hotly pursued by El Senor . Down the hall came the crooning soft voice of Mrs. MacTaggart in song . He poured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senor , filled a jigger glass for himself , and half of another with the peppermint liqueur . He went back to the living room . " Anybody , " he said , " could have dropped into Eliza'ssecondhand store that morning without much chance of being noticed particularly . It 's a business block . Comingsand goings . Drugstore , appliance store , hardware , the pawnshop  --  and on the other side of the street other small businesses . I would n't guess that any of those proprietors hire any help  --  alone in their shops . Who 'd notice who went into the secondhand store ? We 'll be asking , of course . " " But if the will was the reason , " said Alison , " I mean for wanting Eliza out of the way , how did anybody know about it ? She had it hidden pretty well . In fact , it was a ridiculous place to put it , it might easily never have been found at all . I do n't think she was so clever  --  just shrewd in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the family who 'd just found out she owned all that  --  and that I can see happening the way you said , Oscar or Percy hearing it from one of the tenants  --  surely , even as eccentric as they all are , it would have occurred to any of them that she might have made a will ? That it would n't necessarily come to them just automatically on her death ? And besides  --  But , Luis ! " She moved excitedly to face him . " Nop115sirve ! It would n't even if  --  We have been stupid ! She was married ! Comprende ? Como no ! " Mendoza stared at her . " Now for the love of  --  Se me paso , por alto . For God 's sake  --  and it never crossed my mind till this minute  --  Stupid you can say  --  " " She was a California resident . No matter what sort of will she made , one-third of whatever she left had to go by law to the living spouse . I remember that from what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making that settlement  --  " " Un millon de demonios desde el infierno ! " said Mendoza . He stared at the glass in his hand , finished the rye . " True . But is the husband living ? Oscar says they do n't know  --  he left her thirty years ago . Oh , yes ? And if he is living , where is he ? For God 's sake , could he come into this ? How wild can you get ? " " He could be . People change in thirty years . And what would that property be worth ? Even down there ? Twenty , thirty thousand ? More ? To some people  --  " " And , for God 's sake , try to trace him , on what vague information we get from Oscar ? " " And another thing , " said Alison suddenly . " Would Oscaror Henry  --  " " Yes , " said Mendoza . " I know . Would they realize that a living husband , under the law , would prevent their inheritingthe whole shooting match ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next day . The first thing Mendoza did was apply for a search warrant on the Thirkettle house and , on second thought , also for the hotel property . He and Hackett intended to descend on the three lunchers at Mrs. Thirkettle 's house , doubtless interrupting some pleasurable gossip , but there was time to fill before that . Jason Grace caught him as he came into the office . " There 's one thing , Lieutenant . I had to take a summer course back in fifth grade to get caught up on simple arithmetic  --  Virginiafigures all the tax forms for us  --  but I can add a column , you give me time . I was interested enough to go back yesterday afternoon and check all those other tenants . "  | " Oh , yes ? " said Mendoza . A good man , Grace . Grace followed him into his office . " You would n't stop to think  --  that shabby old block of run-down stores . On that street . Very small time , you 'd think . But when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine . A real gold mine after she got it paid off . " He took out his notebook . " It sounds piddling , compared to what rents are even in middle-class districts now . There were four apartments rented at fifty per , one  --  the one Mrs. Stepp has , three rooms  --  at thirty , and four at forty . Which adds up to three-ninety a month  --  right ? " " According to Hoyle . " " And the stores on the ground floor  --  four at fifty apiece , four at forty-five , which adds up to three-eighty . That 's leaving out her own , of course . O.K. ? " " On the nose . " " Well "  --  Grace scratched one ear lobe reflectively  --  " you slice it any way , that adds up to nine grand two hundred and forty bucks a year . " " I 'll take your word for it . A nice little piece of change . " Mendoza scribbled figures . " Yes , indeed . " " All right , " said Grace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em are rented  --  and I had a talk with Wolf , who 's been there longest of any tenant , he says none of the stores has been empty for at least ten years , and it is n't often one of the apartments is vacant . Mrs. Stepp is the next oldest tenant , but the rest of ' em have been there quite some time  --  five , six years up to ten and fifteen . And Mrs. McCann had owned the property clear for just over thirteen years . So you do a little more adding and multiplying  --  " He watched Mendoza do just that . " Caray , a gold mine you can call it . Picayune little sums , but they do add up , do n't they ? " " I make it a hundred and twenty thousand-odd she'sp118taken out of it in that thirteen years . And even discounting the taxes , which ' ! ! be pretty low in that area , and any little repairs she 's had to make in the time she 's owned it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , she 's got to have cleared somewhere around ninety grand at least , possibly more . " " I should think so , " said Mendoza , sounding a little surprised ; he stared at the figures . " It does add up . And there 's what she took in at her own store , Jase . It would n't sound like much , I suppose , but  --  look , by what we get from Manning , cheeseparing is n't the word . They were apparently living , the two of them , on a thousand a year or less . Fifteen bucks a week for groceries , I ask you . And there was the forty a month Manning 's sister gave McCann for baby-sitting with the woman . That 's  --  ah  --  four-eighty a year . My God , if she cleared a thousand a year from her own store , she could have socked away that entire net profit from the business block . " " Um-hum , " said Grace . " Only , where is it ? Those bankbooks  --  theyall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more , at any reckoning . We 've seen her personaleffects  --  nothing there , cheap clothes and not many , no jewelry . " " Yes , " said Mendoza . " Yes . We ca n't get hold of the lawyerwho drew up the will until tomorrow , probably . Or check the banks either . And you know something , Jase ? We do occasionally act stupid around here , despite our reputation . It took my wife to remind us that the woman was married and if the husband 's still alive and has n't divorced her that will is n't worth a damn in this state . " " Well , call us dumb . So it is n't . I 'm bound to say that never came into my mind . " " Or mine , " said Hackett , appearing in the office doorp119with Higgins . " For God 's sake ! Could the husband come into this ? " " Try to find out , " said Mendoza . " It 's possible , I suppose . I know Sunday 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't talked to everybody in that block yet  --  missed most of the tenants upstairs yesterday . Suppose you and George go over there , Jase , and Art and I 'll spring the big surprise on the McLaughlins . " He got up . Landers had started the routine on what Brady had given him overnight : the various police forces in Willits , Rio Dell , and Ukiah would be taking a look in their territoriesfor a girl matching the description of Mary Brown who had left town recently . But he could n't count on that ; the girl Brady remembereddid n't have to be Mary Brown . There were two others he could see today : an off-duty S.P. conductor who 'd been in charge of one of the trains from Sacramento that day and the airline stewardess due in at International at one-fifteen . He thought it was a very long chance that Mary Brown had arrived in L.A. by air , but you never did know , you had to check everything . Piggott came in a few minutes late and said plaintively he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stewardess to check ; there was n't any more they could do on Mary Brown today , personally , and Piggott might as well take an hour or so off to go to church before seeing the stewardess . " But I understand from Rory the lieutenant'sgot a couple of search warrants coming through , we may be wanted on that . " " Oh , shoot , " said Piggott . Piggot was not a swearing man . " If there 's one thing I hate , it 's pawing through other people 's belongings . Makes me feel like a Russian spy or something . "  |p120Which  just went to show that cops are only human . Landers went out to see the S.P. conductor , one Joseph Fritz . He turned out to be a bad-tempered old man , possiblysuffering from ulcers or at least acid indigestion , who glanced at the photograph of Mary Brown and snapped , " I ca n't be expected to notice every last passenger on the train every single run . No , I do n't think I ever saw this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He thrust the photographback at Landers ungraciously . " If you 'd take another look to be sure , sir  --  " " I already did . If she was on my train I did n't notice her . Expect a little peace and quiet , my day off , and the lousy cops got to come botherin '  --  " Well , the citizenry did come all sorts . Landers thanked him very politely and headed back for the office . " Her husband ? " said Oscar blankly . " My goodness , I 'm afraid I would n't know anything about him . Now . She was only married to the man a little while , you know  --  Henry always said he 'd only married Ellie for Father 's money  --  Father was still alive then , he died in , let me see , nineteen thirty  --  and then it came out that all the money was gone  --  it was all in securities , you know , stocks and bonds and things  --  I 'm afraid I 'm rather vague about that , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you come out here a moment ? " He tapped at the double doors . " And I expect Henry was quite right , because it was then the man left her . Ellie . I seem to remember they were living in San Francisco  --  and Ellie came to Stephen  --  that was our eldest brother  --  and  --  Henry ! " " Well , what is it now ? " asked Henry , opening one of the double doors . " Oh , for heaven 's sake , you again . " He looked at Mendoza , annoyed.  | " Henry , they want to know about that young man Ellie married . I do n't even remember his first name , do you ? So long ago  --  I was at the wedding , of course , we all were  --  " " St. Mark 's Episcopal Church in San Francisco . I don't. precisely recall the year , but it would have been nineteen twenty-eight or twenty-nine . I must say I do not see why such irrelevant information  --  His name ? Theodore Roosevelt McCann . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named for a Republican , but I was not so irrational . I saw at once he was only after the money . He had a mustache and hay fever , " said Henry disapprovingly . " Sneezed several times during the ceremony , I remember . " " When did he leave your sister ? " " Really , why all this  --  Oh , a year or two later , I suppose . When the money went . " " Did your sister ever divorce him ? " " She would n't do that , " said Oscar , " no . It would have cost something , would n't it  --  lawyers and all  --  and it was n't as if anybody else wanted to marry her . " " I see , " said Mendoza . " Well , now , Mr. McLaughlin  --  " He brushed his own mustache , eying the pair of them , and began telling them about Mrs. McCann 's small fortune . The bankbooks , the deed , the accumulated profits . Both McLaughlins stared at him blankly . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the store is ? Ellie leased that , I 'm  --  " " No , Mr. McLaughlin . That may have been what she told you , but she owned it . That whole block of business . She began buying it in nineteen thirty-one , and she paid off the mortgage clear in nineteen fifty-two . At the least calculation she 'd realized somewhere around ninetyp122thousand dollars from it in the last thirteen years . We have found the record of a little under twenty-four thousandin savings accounts in various banks . Do  --  " " Twenty  --  " Oscar was stricken speechless . " Well , I must say , " said Henry angrily , " if that is n't exactly like Grandfather Elias ! Father always said she was very like him . Behind our backs like that , and never a word when I was so bad with flu last year  --  all that money , I could have gone to a proper doctor  --  And my eyes , you can say what you like , Oscar , but these magnifying glasses from Woolworth 's are not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat listening to me complain and never a word when she could have  --  I must say I always thought her a very selfish woman and this only goes to show how right I was ! All that money  --  " " Ill of the dead , Henry . But it does seem as if she could have  --  I 've been badly in need of a new suit for quite some time , and it would n't have hurt her to  --  Henry ! Do you suppose we shall inherit some of it ? We 're her only relatives , after all  --  " " That just occurred to you , Mr. McLaughlin ? " asked Hackett . " You did n't know anything about this before ? " " Know about it ? Why , none of us had the least suspicion  --  and I still do n't understand how she can have acquired all that  --  Do you suppose we will ? " Oscar looked eager and excited : a happy fat child . " I 've sometimes thought if I could afford to set up my business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , you see , that 's why we 'd like to know about Mrs. McCann 's husband , " said Mendoza gently . " Under Californialaw , if he 's still living and still legally married to her at the time of her death , he 's entitled to one-third of the estate . " The brothers looked momentarily stunned at this in/telligence . " That  --  fortune hunter ? " said Henry . " After all this time ? Well , I should call that a most monstrous miscarriage of justice , sir . That young whippersnapper ! " " I suppose he could be still alive somewhere , " said Oscar , looking ready to cry . " Really , this does surprise me . Ellie was so good at manag ng things , I should have thought she 'd have made beter arrangements . I really would . Dying so suddenly , and in the store  --  but I supposes he could n't help that , if it 's as you say , but still  --  " He shook his head mournfully . Mendoza went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if her husband is still living and had n't divorced her , he 'll be due his share  --  but the court does generally take into consideration the deceased 's intentions , " he said deliberately . " I should doubt that you 'll get any of it . " " Oh , dear , " said Oscar . " All that money  --  who would have dreamed  --  " " Very like Eliza , " said Henry acidly . " I 've no doubt she planned it that way . Very much like Grandfather Elias . Grasping and selfish . And that being so , Oscar , it appearsI had best get on with My Work if we are not actuallyto starve . " He glared at them and retreated behind the double doors , closing the open one with a little crash which raised a fine cloud of dust from the bare floor of the lobby . " I really do n't know what we 'd have done , " said Oscar , " if we had n't still owned the hotel . Imagine Ellie saving all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us something , but while one does n't like to speak ill of the dead , I 'm bound to say it was like her . She was embittered , I 'm afraid . That young man leaving her , and losing all Father 's money . " He sighed . " And I had better warn you , Mr. McLaughlin , " said Mendoza smoothly , " that we 'll be coming back with ap124search warrant some time today . As some of your sister'smmh  --  propertydoes seem to be unaccounted for  --  and for various other reasons  --  we 'll be making a thorough search of the premises . " " Oh , dear , oh , dear , " said Oscar agitatedly . " My good sir , eighty rooms ! You ca n't possibly  --  and I really can not see what good  --  " " We 'll be seeing you later , " said Hackett . " We just like to be thorough , Mr. McLaughlin . " " Oh , dear  --  " They left Oscar twittering distractedly . " What do you think ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess . But I guess I think if Oscar or Henry knew about Eliza 's nest egg before , they 're both a damn sight better actors than I thought they were . " Mendoza rattled the car keys in his hand meditatively . " I guess I think so too . But that 's not to say there was n't some other reason . " " Oh , granted , " said Hackett . " Granted . With this crowd . Lightfoot could have poisoned Ellie because Ellie criticizedher singing . But my mind does keep going back to the Thirkettle woman . " " The so-obvious answer . Yes . Well , we 'll see what the three legatees seem to add up to . " Mendoza unlocked the Ferrari ; they got in . They were , he thought , the three most ordinary old biddies he 'd ever laid eyes on . For this part of L.A. , for this part of any big city in this nation . They were types . You could call it poor but honest . Littlepeople . All women in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money and nothing interesting happening to them ever , so that the little things that hap/pened to them were exciting . Uninteresting women , except that every human entity , of immense interest and importance to itself , was interesting . Tabitha Thirkettle . The little birdlike widow of a railroad man who 'd never had any children , lived a routineof saving to pay for the little house , for furniture : whose largest interest was her little hobby of brewing oldfashionedsimples . It could be guessed , maybe pressing them on everyone she knew : " Just try it , my dear , you might be surprised , it ca n't do any harm  --  " Ida Mae Glidden . Mrs. Another type . A hearty overblown-lookingwoman , hair firmly kept brass-blonde , a littletoo much make-up . Another widow : " Grass , " she told them cheerfully . One of those people described as the salt of the earth : not overeducated , very down-to-earth , the kind nothing got down for long . Generous , unimaginative , a little bossy , kind , good-natured  --  all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd lived close to the bone and might have an eye out for the main chance . Marcia Hunt . A self-effacing woman . Colorless . Medium-sized , medium-complexioned , mouse-brown hair goinggray , unnoticeable clothes , no make-up , medium every way . Thin little voice . Also a widow . She was on pension and did baby-sitting on the side sometimes , she said primly . There would n't be much of that down here , where parents could n't afford paid attendants . Her husband had worked for the railroad too : that was where the pension came from and how she happened to know Tabitha Thirkettle . A funny foursome it had been , thought Mendoza . He looked at Mrs. Glidden , the odd one out in a way . Dyed hair , make-up , the different type from the others : but underthe surface , he suspected , a simple soul . " How 'd you meet Mrs. McCann ? " he asked her conversationally.  | " Oh , I was looking for an armchair . Did n't matter for looks , I live alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I dropped in at her place just looking  --  but I ca n't get over it  --  Ellie poisoned  --  even by accident  --  Well , my God , you got ta be careful , never know what 's in anythingthese days  --  some of the tints I use say on the directions  --  " Mrs. Glidden was a beauty operator . Employed at some two-bit shop on lower Broadway , probably at something like sixty a week . " Of course it must have been an accident of some kind , " said Mrs. Hunt nervously . " I mean , really , it ca n't have been anything else  --  " She kept darting uneasy little glances at Tabitha ; and both she and Mrs. Thirkettle were looking at Mendoza and Hackett like rabbits transfixed by a pair of cobras . But a lot of utterly innocent people , inadvertentlymixed up in a homicide , might look at cops that way . " That 's just what I said , " said Mrs. Thirkettle faintly . " How did you meet Mrs. McCann and when ? " asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time ago  --  fifteen or sixteen years  --  I was looking for a  --  for a lamp , " said Mrs. Thirkettle , " and somebody 'd told me this place on Los Angeles Street had nice things sometimes , and I  --  And we got to talking , and  --  She was an educated woman , and we just took to each other  --  and I felt sorry for her  --  " She pressed her hands together nervously ; they were shaking . " Now , for goodness ' sake , do n't take on , Tabby , " said Mrs. Glidden . " Accident or whatever  --  and it do n't seem likely to me that Ellie of all people should get , well , my goodness , murdered , for heaven 's sake  --  that 's senseless , I guess it was some kind accident all right  --  but nobodyp127could think you had anything to do with it ! " She was the one not at all disturbed by police on the premises . She uttered a fat comfortable laugh . " I guess we all felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lieutenant ?  --  on accounta , well , leastways all the rest of us , we 'd had a few good times , you know ? And good husbands . Like with my second , Joe , we had some real good times , only he would get to gambling . I mean , we all hadda work hard and all , but we had something , know what I mean , outta life . Look back on . Only Ellie , she never . " " I tried to tell them , " said Mrs. Thirkettle painfully . " Ida , they think  --  but it 's not so ! I never  --  you know I never  --  use any of the dangerous things  --  " " Do n't take on , " said Mrs. Glidden . " That 's just foolish , they could n't think you had anything to do with it , Tabby . What I mean is "  --  she turned rather protuberant china-blue eyes on Mendoza  --  " that husband walkin ' out on her , not married a year  --  she was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I guess he was just after that , and that kind of sours a woman , you know . She never really had anything , I guess you could sort of forgive and forget , like they say , about her being kind of how she was . Sarcasticand all . She had n't had much of a life . Like me , I had some good times , and I got my married daughter and grandchildren up in Fresno , she 's by my first husband , he was a drummer in this band and we  --  " " Mr. Hunt and I always went to all the musical shows , " said Mrs. Hunt thinly . " I know exactly what you mean , Ida , she had her faults , but have n't we all ? Mr. Hunt used to say  --  " " But I never do use any of the things that could be dangerous , " said Mrs. Thirkettle . " I do n't  --  It just could n't be  --  " She put a hand to her mouth.  |p128Three  very ordinary women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of killers . Like everybody else , they came all sorts . There was , he thought , one little thing . A very human thing . If you were magnanimous enough to make a will leaving somebody all your worldly wealth , it was a human impulse to let that somebody know about it , to bask in the fulsome gratitude before you shuffled off . And even these three ordinary women  --  Well , money was a safeguard . An insurance . An assurance . These women living pretty close to the bone . Always aware ( as people in the sixties always would be aware ) of what could happen to them . The long painful illness , money cushioning it , the disability . The temptation , knowing  --  Because if Eliza had told them about the will , she 'd have told them what she had to leave too . Would n't she ? Or would she ? And quite evidently none of them had really been terriblyfond of Eliza McCann . Proximity , familiarity had kept these four friends . Eliza McCann was not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been really fond of . He looked at Hackett , looming impressively beside him in Mrs. Thirkettle 's neat and clean little living room , and very gently he said , " Did any of you know that Mrs. McCannwas a wealthy woman ? That she owned that entire block on Los Angeles Street ? " " Owned  --  What d' you mean ? why , for goodness ' sake , " said Mrs. Glidden , " she  --  " " And that she 'd made a will leaving her entire estate to be divided among you three ? " " What ? " said Mrs. Hunt loudly . " Tabitha , you did n't  --  " " Oh , my God ! " said Mrs. Thirkettle , and toppled from her chair in a dead faint.  | " Well , that was a little exercise in futility , " said Hackett some forty minutes later as they came back to the car . Mendozaagreed morosely . On being revived , Mrs. Thirkettle had burst into tears , which had taken the effect of turning Mrs. Glidden indignantat the brutal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accident ; and Tabby would n't harm a fly , and talking about poison like some horrible true-police thing , and if they had n't anything better to do than come and bully three innocent women , and last Wednesday she 'd been at work all day like the honest woman she was from eight to five , and if they thoughtMrs . Hunt had nervously admitted to being home all morning on Wednesday and going to the movies in the afternoon . She lived alone.  |p130And  a tearful Mrs. Thirkettle had said in a frightened whisper she had n't gone out all day : worked in her garden . And she never " Ask the neighbors if anybody saw her ? " asked Hackett now . " You can see into the yard from both sides . " He tried one house and Mendoza tried the other , but nobodywas home at either place . " Sunday , " said Mendoza tersely , starting the engine . " Damnation . So somebody noticed her out in the yard at ten A.M. , that does n't say she could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ De veras . Where are we heading ? " " Over to the store , see if George and Jase picked up anything new . " On Los Angeles Street they found Higgins outside the closed pawnshop chatting with Wolf . Grace , he said , was upstairs in the next apartment questioning that tenant . " Not an awful lot shows , Luis . Mr. Wolf here saw two women go into the store that morning , but he does n't know either of ' em , and nobody else we 've talked to noticedanybody going in . " " Just two women , " said Wolf . " Ordinary . One at a time , I mean . The best I can do it 'd be about nine , nine-thirty for one and later for the other . Business slow and it 's nice spring weather , I 'm sometimes standing in the door . . . Oh , middle-aged , say , both of ' em . " Mendoza thought about Mrs. Lightfoot , Mrs. Rialto , Miss Manning . " Did you see either of their faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past my place and was facing up the block when I noticed . " So . Any of those women , seen half a block away from the back , might be described as middle-aged . It might be an idea to have Wolf take a look at them . ButGrace came out of the door up from the shop door ; he was wearing a little smile . He sauntered up to them.  | " Mrs. McCann tell you she was planning to raise the rents , Mr. Wolf ? " " No , she did not , " said Wolf . " My God , was she ? It 's all I can do , make that ninety now . Did she tell the Rasmus-sens ? " " Uh-huh . Seems Mrs. Rasmussen was in the store on Tuesday and Mrs. McCann mentioned it . They 're payingforty and she was going to raise it by five . " Wolf looked worried . " First time I think of it  --  who does it go to , you know ? Her family ? I do n't know any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but these are cheap stores , you see for yourself . I do n't know  --  " " I would n't worry , " said Mendoza . " I have an idea there may be a little hassle over who inherits , Mr. Wolf . May be some time before the new owner has the leisure to think about raising rents . " " I hope to God , " said Wolf . " Well , gentlemen , I do n't bother you . " He walked off toward the drugstore . " Somebody 's home at all the apartments , " said Higgins . " But nobody noticed anybody going into the place on Wednesday . Of course there 're the people on the other side of the street . In the apartments . We caught all the proprietors downstairs yesterday , and nobody did . " " She was going to raise the Rasmussens ' rent , " said Mendozameditatively . " All of the rents maybe ? " " Mrs. Rasmussen sort of gathered that . Naturally she did n't like it . Nobody around here with much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you ? " " Not really , " said Mendoza , " no . " He sighed . " So let 's start asking the people across the street . " They split up and began knocking on doors . The street doors leading to the apartments gave on very narrow , rickety old stairs : upstairs , small square landings fronted single doors . It would be much the same arrangement asp132in the business block Eliza McCann had owned . The two apartments Mendoza visited were alike except for the furniture : three smallish rooms with narrow windows looking out on the old street . Neither the bent-over deaf old woman nor the harassed couple with a sick baby rememberedseeing anyone enter the secondhand shop across the street last Wednesday morning . He came out to the street again and met Higgins just emerging from the next door down . " Very small jackpot , " said Higgins . " There 's usually one to every couple of blocks or so . The snoopy old maid with nothing better to do than look out the window most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did she see ? " " Nothing of much use to us . In fact , just the opposite . She was n't looking out every minute , but she did see the two women Wolf saw  --  strangers to her  --  and she says the second one went in before the first one came out . One came out with a big parcel , the other with nothing . She noticed all the excitement , with the squad cars and ambulance , after Lee Rainey called in , and I gather she sat there glued to the window even after everybody 'd gone away . " " So ? " " So nothing , " said Higgins . " She was n't sitting glued to the window until then . She did say  --  backing up what that funny old harridan told us  --  that earlier that morning she 'd seen Mrs. Stepp come out the door there and start up the street . " " Mmh , " said Mendoza . " And I do just wonder whether Eliza had meant to raise all the rents . She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Stepp ? That old witch  --  Well , nice to know somebody 's out of it . Yes , let 's see if Eliza 'd said anything to her . " They walked across the street , found the street doorp133beside the secondhand shop unlocked , went in , and climbed dusty stairs in a thick fusty odor compounded of long-ago cabbage , old dust , and some seventy-five years of humanity living with the windows shut . Mendoza knocked at the apartment door . After an interval he knocked again . A shuffling step , and Gladys Stepp peered out at them round the half-open door . " And what do you want ? " " Just a few questions , Mrs. Stepp , if we may come in  --  " " No , you ca n't come in . I was just takin ' my nap . I 'm an old woman , I need my sleep . " " Sorry to bother you , ma'am , " said Higgins genially , " but we 'd like to know if you 'd talked to Mrs. McCann lately . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't told you she was going to raise the rent ? " She stared up at him ; for a moment there Mendoza had the absurd fleeting thought that it was impossible the two of them could belong to the same species  --  hunched little ancient witchlike female in her dirty ragged clothes and towering broad-shouldered homicide sergeant in the casual-tailored gray suit and clean white shirt , still lookingnew-shaven . What meeting of minds ? The old woman  --  slow , tenacious , rapacious mind  --  blinked and worked her sunken lips together . " That one , she was a miser and a hypocrite and her soul went straight to hell , " she muttered . " I could n't say about that , " said Higgins , " but had she told you  --  " " Ca n't get blood outta a stone . No , I du n no nothing about that . " She 'd brought a filthy rag of handkerchief out of her pocket to wipe her nose ; she peered at him over it . " I coulden 've paid no more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would n't dare . No , mister . Ca n't get blood out of a stone  --  that 's right in the Bible . I 'm a poor old woman with no kin or kith call my own , an ' I 've lived here twenty years since back I was able work an ' earn , but no more . I got the pension and it ai n't easy to get along . But God helps them as helps themselves and got faith and prays regular . " And she added suddenly and conversationally , " I got to fix my dinner , " and shut the door on them . They looked at each other and started downstairs again . " God , what a place to live , " said Higgins . " Untactful , George . I grew up in much the same kind of neighborhood not so far away . " " Well , having to live down here does n't mean you 've got to live like that . " " And a surprising number of people do n't , " said Mendoza . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it he and Art had missed lunch . And those search warrants ought to be coming through pretty soon . They walked up to Higgins ' car and found Hackett and Grace sitting in it . " I had thought , " Grace was saying , " of just paying off the note on the bedroom set  --  it 's only another thirty dollars  --  as a kind of practical birthday present . But maybe a little too practical . Pretty woman likes to get something nice for her birthday . Jewelry or something . " " I tell you , " said Hackett , " there 's this new fad . Costume watches . I would n't know , but Angel was mentioning it the other night , there was an ad in the paper . Bullocks ' , I think . Lapel watches and necklaces and so on . From ten ninety-five up . " " Well , that 's a thought , " said Grace . " Thanks very much . I might go and look at them . " Mendoza leaned in the car window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Hackett . He yawned . " Let 's knock off and go home , Luis . I 've still got spring fever . " " Do n't you wish we could . I just realized we missed lunch . " " Well , so we did . " " Neither of us had much either , " said Higgins . " Only the drugstore along here  --  packaged sandwiches . " " Meet you at Federico 's in ten minutes , " said Mendoza . Grace brightened . " Sure . Maybe one I came across last night 'd sharpen our wits some , Lieutenant . It 's called a Bloodhound . Appropriate . " " What 's in it ? " asked Mendoza fearfully . " Oh , not much . Half gin , a quarter dry vermouth , a quarter sweet vermouth , and you slice some nice fresh strawberries into it . " " My God ! " said the other three in unison . The search warrants came through by the time they got back to the office , and Mendoza dispatched Piggott and Landers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , would be quite a job . But despite Oscar 's chatter about accumulations , when he came to think of it , it was likely that the accumulations were in the actual living quarters . The great majority of the rooms would simply be empty ; doubtless the McLaughlins had sold off all the unneeded furniture in their early straits , or it could be that had formed the first stock for Eliza 's secondhand store so long ago . " And you know , " he said to Hackett , " how ideal for somebody wanting a little privacy to mix up the homemadepoison . That barracks of a place . Quietly slip up to one of the empty rooms miles away from any occupied one ,  |p136with  a hot plate and a basin of water and your pockets stuffed with the common foxglove . " " And I 'd still like to know where that came from , " said Hackett . Everyone was at home but the furtive Miss Allenby . Oscarlet them in , looking frightened for a moment at their numbers  --  Mendoza , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apologized . " Really just a formality , Mr. McLaughlin . Here 's the warrant . " " Oh , dear , " said Oscar . " Such an upset . The last few days have been simply hell , and I 'm not a man to swear , but that 's what it has been . Ellie managed things so well . Gertrude  --  And shopping lists , you know , though Henry and I were most scrupulous about paying for our own things  --  but she managed . And I 'm afraid I do tend to be absent-minded , and the milk went sour , and then I quite forgot about bread , and that poor dear Miss Manninggot Swiss cheese instead of American , and Henry has a thing about Swiss cheese , on account of the holes , and  --  I really do n't understand what you hope to find  --  And you have n't said when I can have the body . You have n't  --  already done anything ? " " The inquest is tomorrow morning , Mr. McLaughlin , " said Mendoza . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , yes , there was something  --  we never do get any mail , so I did take note  --  And after that I can have the body ? " " That 's right . " Mendoza looked at him curiously . Was Oscar actually planning to embalm his sister 's body per-sonally ? " And why must I be disturbed day and night ? " demandedHenry , opening the double doors suddenly and raising a cloud of dust from the floor.  | " It 's the warrant  --  I told you about it , Henry . I told you. , , " Tosh , " said Henry . " Sorry to disturb you , Mr. McLaughlin , " said Higgins . " We might as well start here , I guess . " He moved toward Henry , who commenced to swell like a bullfrog . " You propose to search my room ? To disturb my things ? This is an outrage ! I demand to know  --  " " We have a search warrant , " said Mendoza patiently . Higgins could be trusted to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things George Higgins and his seventy-five tough inches could not deal with . He simply stepped past Henry into the long room , and Henry , put on the defensive , slammed the door and began to protest incoherently . " You , " said Mendoza to Grace and Glasser , " start with the top floor . Most of the rooms are probably empty , and it wo n't take long , but look for any signs of  --  well , you know what to look for . Mr. McLaughlin , is there a safe in the hotel ? " " A safe ? Oh , you mean  --  when it was a real hotel in the old days , for guests ' valuables ? Oh , yes , there was , but we sold it a long time ago . " Maybe yes and maybe no , thought Mendoza . He went behind the old counter and Oscar hopped after him . " It was there , sir . " A little cupboard built flush into the wall and fastened once with a hasp and padlock : 1900 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trusting people had been . The cupboard was quite empty . He drummed his fingers on the counter . Well , thorough they tried to be . The deadly routine . " Art , " he said absently , " just to get that out of the way , suppose you get Mr. Mc/Laughlin to let you into his place next door and look that over . I think  --  " " My place ? But I thought  --  really , there 's nothing there , just my  --  my equipment , you know  --  really , I did n't think  --  " " Now I hope you 'll be cooperative . " And Mendoza gave Oscar his suavest smile . " The warrant covers both . " " Oh , well , " said Oscar weakly , " oh , well  --  " " And I know the lab men covered it , but I think I 'll just have another look around her room , " added Mendoza to Hackett . " If you do n't mind , Mr. McLaughlin ? " "  --  do n't believe in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he unlocked the door of the little building next door . " An undertaker is an undertaker , and calling himself a mortician really does n't change the fact . As you can see , there 's nothing here , sir , nothing but  --  but the tools of my work . I 've often thought if I could afford to advertise  --  fix the place up  --  " The first room furnished shabbily as an office . And what good all this would do , thought Hackett  --  Whoever had been elementarily smart enough to get Eliza to swallow the fatal dose would be smart enough not to leave any evidence around , and he or she had had five days to get rid of the evidence . ButHe looked distastefully around at the inner room : long table with grooves in it , just like the one they used for autopsies . The jars , the hypodermic needles , the boxes of cotton wadding  --  the equipment for dealing with the dead . He agreed with Mr. Caradoccio : not a natural job for a man to want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front room , but still not good : sixty-watt bulbs . " I  --  I 'm not here really very often , " said Oscar , " as ap139matter of fact . " He sounded wistful . " Just to keep it all clean and dusted . And I do try to keep up my  --  my stock , you know , to have everything on hand in case I do get a client . " Hackett went into the little hall . Two doors . he opened the one to the rear room . Trestles stacked together . Folding chairs . An old portable organ with a couple of keys missing . " That came into the store once . If I had a really proper place to have a nice little chapel  --  " Hackett tried the other door ; it was locked . " What 's in here ? " " Just more  --  more equipment , " said Oscar . " That 's all . Do you want to  --  ? " Resignedly he sorted out keys , unlocked the door . Hackett went in , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a small room , and it was filled with coffins , all spread out over the floor space . Nothing else . The shade was pulled nearly down on the one window , but the westering sun poked light under it to strike gleams here and there . And in any case this was probably a wild-goose chase . If Oscar had been the one who 'd somehow introduced the homemade brew into sister Eliza , he had one dandy place to mix it up . I-Iackett went back to the room with the long table in the middle . He pried into every drawer and looked into every jar and bottle with grim thoroughness , and he did n't find anything remotely suspicious or suggestive . Of anything except that Oscar was , as they 'd already known , a funny one . Funny-peculiar . An undertaker with no customers ever , keeping all his embalming equipment fresh and handy , his long table polished . The coffins spread out for grieving mourners to make a selection .   " Thanks very much , " he said on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaccustomed silence . Hackett climbed stairs and hunted down long dusty halls in search of Mendoza and found him still in Eliza 's room . He found him unprecedentedly  --  the fastidious Mendoza , wearing a newish silver-gray Dacron suit  --  flat on his stomach on a very of the room . Originally one of the betterrooms of the hotel : about twenty feet square , the fireplace , a very high old double bed , a couple of chairs , a tall chiffonier , and the walls lined with books . Only about a quarter of them on shelves , the rest stacked more or less neatly with spines outward . " What the hell  --  " said Hackett. " i Valgame Dios ! " Mendoza wriggled farther into the opening . " It 's coming  --  if I could just  --  That you , Art ? " " In person . What in hell are you doing ? " Mendoza wriggled backward and stood up , brushing himself down . " I do n't suppose there 's a vacuum cleaner in this damn place . My God . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lab boys are supposed to be thorough , but sometimes they do lack imagination . You have a try at it . Big he-man , maybe you can shift it . There 's an iron plate for coal or whatever , I want to see what 's under it . " " For God 's sake , thorough , " said Hackett . He prudently took off his jacket and lay down prone , worked his head and shoulders into the long-dead grate . He got hold of the plate and yanked . It lifted toward him quite readily ; it was , he found , backing out with it , perforated with long slots to let the ashes fall through into a trap below . " You were n't far enough in . It comes out easy enough if you  --  "  | " I have not your inches , " said Mendoza . " Yes , and it ought not to , you know . I doubt if there 's been a fire built there , or that grate cleaned out , these forty years . See what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new suit every time I turn around , " complained Hackett , and flattened himself again . God , the way some people lived  --  Dust thick in his nostrils , he sneezed . The trap below , for the ashes , was not very deep : perhaps a foot . He thought irrelevantly , igoo , and servant girls three bucks a week  --  clean out the damn grate after every evening 's fire  --  His groping fingers met metal , and he pulled it : flat sharp corners . A box . He lifted it out and wriggled back out of the grate . " Something ? " asked Mendoza eagerly . " Something . " Hackett stood up . " You and your crystal ball . " He dusted his trousers . They looked at the box . " Pure logical deduction , Arturo , " said Mendoza . " No safety-deposit keys among her personal effects . No other secret caches at the store . And that fairly large sum unaccountedfor  --  call it in round terms sixty grand . I just thought  --  like the idiot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it into or whether she kept it in cash , she might want it close under her eye . Well hidden . Bet you "  --  he was struggling with the clasp  --  " she kept her room locked when she was out . " It was a dark-green metal box about ten by eight , six inches deep . Fireproof . A nice safe-deposit box in a very secret place . The catch yielded to pressure and the lid lifted , and they looked at the contents . " Oh , yes , " said Mendoza . " I might have known . I really might have known . " Tightly-wound rolls of pale flannel , tied neatly with ribbons . " Like my sainted grandmother , anybody who 's lived close to the bone , experienced the overnight crash . Sure , sure , the portable value . " He untiedp144window . And the walls had big zinc sheets nailed onto them . Funniest setup you ever saw . We asked about it , but nobody knew anything , Oscar said it 'd been that way when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they just left it . I ask you . " " How odd , " said Angel . " Maybe somebody who lived there years ago  --  oh , kept tame birds or  --  a funny pet of some sort  --  " Hackett shook his head . " I do n't know . And do you know the sister  --  Jane  --  kept all her mother 's clothes ? In a trunk in her room . You would n't believe it  --  stuff dating back to the eighties  --  most of it in rags . No moth balls . And , my God , I 'll never again sneer at astrologists , the Rialto woman was doing something she called erecting a horoscope , and it looked four times as complicated as an income-tax form . " " Nothing could be , Art , " said Angel . " Oh , damn , " she added as she stabbed herself with the needle and sucked the wound . " And there were dozens of books in Oscar 's room too and every single one of them something to do with undertaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine put out for morticians . With advertisements for embalmingfluid and cosmetics and so on . He is a funny one . And  --  you know , " said Hackett suddenly , " I ca n't for the life of me put a finger on it , but something about that other place  --  Oscar 's place  --  bothers me . Something I noticed there , some little thing  --  no , it 's gone . " He shook his head . " It 'll come back to you . Is that the baby ? " Angel listened . " False alarm , thank heaven . " " And the Lightfoot woman  --  my God , these people  --  she 's the one that sings , you know  --  she 's got all sorts of costumes , for all the musical parts , Carmen and Lucia dip145Lammermoor and all of Gilbert and Sullivan and  --  homemadestuff she 's put together herself  --  and the only thing she brought with her , says Oscar , besides her clothes is this great big mirror  --  what do I mean : a pier glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts on the costumes and watches herself sing . People , " said Hackett . " I call that rather pathetic . " " I suppose you can think of it that way . And then that Allenby creature  --  she was n't there . Nobody seems to know much about her . But what we found in her room was , you might say , sort of suggestive , and Luis called in for a uniformed man to post there till she gets home . " " Oh ? " " Four wrist watches , " said Hackett , " and a transistor radio , and half-a-dozen cigarette lighters and a camera and various such stuff  --  all brand new . " " For heaven 's sake ! " said Angel amusedly . " You do n't mean  --  " " Well , it looks sort of suggestive , does n't it ? We had quite a day , " said Hackett . At eight-thirty , relaxing at home , he was n't as yet aware that they were to have quite a night too . " A shoplifter ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed . Small time . As I say , we left a man to wait for her . I tell you that place attracts the nuts . Or maybe the McLaughlins attract ' em  --  I do n't know . The Manning woman was writing love letters to her Albert . Mrs. Rialto said she finds that pathetic . Fellow was killed at Belleau Wood . " " What does she do with them when she 's written them ? " asked Angel , and put down her sewing to get up and adjustthe lamp at her side more advantageously . Hackett had just taken out his lighter , and as the lamp was shifted it struck a gleam of reflective light from the metal . " Ac/tually mail them ? I suppose they 'd wind up in the dead-letter  --  " " By damn ! " said Hackett . " That was it  --  it came to me just now  --  in Oscar 's place . The light  --  " He looked at her , unlighted cigarette in one hand , lighter in the other , with an expression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Just a little funny thing  --  room was dark , but what light there was just glinted off it . There was a name plate on one of those coffins . A metal plate . Listen , that 's silly . They do n't put name plates on empty coffins , do they ? " Angel stared at him . " It must have been a metal part of some kind . " " It was a wooden coffin . I think . No , no , I noticed it at the time , the whole picture 's in my mind  --  " Hackett shut his eyes . " It was the one nearest the door . The sun just hit the plate , it was screwed onto the top of the coffin , nearer one end than the other . Plate about four inches long  --  I saw it and it went right out of my mind , because I was looking for evidence of somebody mixing up that  --  My God , they do n't , do they ? " " Oh , do n't be silly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think there was  --  anything  --  in it ? " " I do n't know , " said Hackett . " Of course not , there could n't have been a body in it , for God 's sake . I do n't think Oscar 's ever had a client , as he calls it , well , he has n't even got a hearse  --  how could he  --  And he 'd have said , and it would n't have been just lying there with all the others  --  " He got up . " I think I 'll call Luis . It 's nothing , of course , but  --  " He deposited the cat on the couch . When Alison answered the phone , she said , " You just caught him . Luis ! He was going out the door . Your smalltimeshoplifter just came home and he 's going down to see her  --  they took her over to  --  it 's Art  --  Headquarters and  --  "  | " And , " said Mendoza 's deep voice , " she had the day 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old gag . " " Well , well , " said Hackett . That was indeed an old trick : the low-necked unbelted dress , the voluminous bloomers , the loot dropped down the decolletage to be held in the bloomers . " I 'll be damned . Look , I just thought of something . It 's nothing  --  I do n't know what it is  --  but I 'll pass it on . There was  --  I just remembered it  --  something sort of bothered me about that place of Oscar 's , but I could n't think what it was , and then all of a sudden it came to me , and it 's wild , but  --  there was a name plate on one of those coffins . " , 1A  --  , " A name plate . And , look , they do n't put them on until , well , there 's a corpse chosen for the coffin . Do they ? Or vice versa . But there it was . I saw it without really seeing it , and it was n't until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate , " said Mendoza . " A name plate . On one of the  --  " There was a profound silence at the other end of the line . " You there ? " said Hackett after a minute . " A  --  are you sure ? " " I said so . I can see it in my  --  " Another silence . " You there ? " said Hackett . " I am , " said Mendoza , " adding two and two . I think . No creo en semejante cosa . I do n't believe it . No . I do not  --  " And then he uttered a little gasp and said , " Excepto  --  lacdmara ! But it 's not  --  And I do wonder whether , considering  --  " Another silence . Hackett was about to speak when Mendoza said , " Listen , Art ! You there ? " " I 'm right here . " " Yes , and Oscar being Oscar  --  Listen . Meet me down there . Now . Do n't drive into Old High Street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll meet you andp148George  --  I 'll call him now  --  in front of the Caradoccio house as soon as you can get there . And do n't come strollingup the center of the sidewalk whistling the latest hit . " Mendoza sounded obscurely excited . " Now what in God 's name  --  Why ? Look , I was  --  " " Relaxed . Se . If you will have these afterthoughts  --  I do n't know  --  it 's fantastic  --  but I just think we ought to look into it , Arturo . Damn it , I must be seeing visions in the crystal ball this time , but  --  I 'll see you , make it snappy ! " Hackett put the phone down with a groan . " Why did I have to get a boss with built-in radar ? I 've got to go out again . I do n't know why , my Angel . Luis is seeing ghosts . " He left the Barracuda parked around the corner on Bellevueand walked quietly into Old High Street . It was ninefifty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street lights down here and the one midway of the block was still out . He only hoped none of them would get knocked on the head by the roving J.D. 's again . The old buildings along here were mostly converted to use as shops and stores , and all of those were closed now . A few houses at this end of the block were still in use as residences , but all were mostly dark and silent : everybody home was inside watching TV , thought Hackett sardonically ; even people down here behind on the rent had TV . No grass at the sidewalk 's edge , but he walked quietly , wondering what on earth was in Mendoza 's mind . Just this side of the Caradoccio house something touched his shoulderout of the dark and he nearly jumped back . " Art ? " A whisper . " What the hell 's he got up his sleeve now ? " " I do n't know , " Hackett hissed back . " Is he here ? Allp149I did was mention  --  and , damn it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " hissed Higgins . " He said to make like a cat burglar , just in case . " " In case of what ? " They were leaning against the picket fence round Mr. Caradoccio 's property , and they both leaped like startled fawns in the blackness when a hand gripped each of them by an arm . " You sound like a pair of steam presses , " said Mendoza , just audible . " Dios . I 've been here fifteen minutes . Listen . Single-file , behind me  --  up to this side of Oscar 's place . Thank God there 's no moon . Take cover at the side of the building . I think you may be a little entertained if the show lives up to the first act . Now , quiet ! " Hackett crept obediently after Higgins , close along the front of the building ; this was about midway of the block , where the blacked-out street light was , and he could n't see three feet ahead of him in the blackness . They were past the Caradoccio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a hand seized his arm and steered him in from the sidewalk to hug the side of that building . Long ago it had been a residence , and this side was the driveway  --  probably , when a family had lived there , the carriageway . Never-paved , packed earth under his feet . " Twenty paces up , " said Mendoza almost soundlessly in his ear . Hackett moved , feeling the other two men ahead , countingpaces . As he took the twentieth his left foot hit a small stone and it struck the side of the building a glancing slight blow . Instantly , from just over his head it seemed , a nervous voice said , low , " What was that ? " " A cat , a cat . Wandering . " Impatient voice . Henry .   " Really , I see no reason why we must do this now . They 're well enough here . " " No , guess Oscar 's right . " Ben Kelly . " Night them Eyetaliansallus go to the movies , nobody home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's well get ' em shifted back home . Long as the fuzz already searched . ' Specially considerin ' old man Brown . " " Such an upset . " Oscar . A heavy dragging sound . " Hold the light steady , Henry , please ! There . Have you got her , Ben ? " " I got her . Up we go . " A thin wavering pencil of light outlined a window directly above them : these old places built high off the ground . The window , Hackett figured out , was the window of the room where all those coffins had been . There was heavy breathing , panting sounds of effort , slow heavy steps . The light moved . The sounds lessened . " Back door , " breathed Mendoza . Hackett moved with him farther up the drive , cautiously , his right hand against the house wall . It fell away as he reached the back wall . A door creaked . " Do be careful with the light , Henry . I know just where I left the dolly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must get the weight distributed , Ben . There ! " More pants and straining breaths . " Damn fuzz . " Ben . " All this work . All I say is it 's a damn shame that whole back yard 's blacktopped . If you 'd  --  " " I know , I know , " said Oscar fretfully . " But it would have looked odd if I 'd dug it up . And at the time we all thought  --  Well , let 's get on . I sha n't feel really happy until we 've got them all home again , we 'll have the rest of the night to get them upstairs  --  And such a waste of effort when they did look at my place after all . But thatp151big one just glanced in . Of course they looked more natural there . " Creaking and puffing . " Hold it , for goodness ' sake , do n't let it tilt too far  --  just so the wheels  --  there . " " Who 's this ? " grunted Ben . " Must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones . " " Well , they 're all encased in lead , of course . I did n't notice , we were in such an upset and hurry I did n't put them in order . I shall be glad to have them all back decentlyplaced with some respect  --  " Oscar 's low voice was fading away . The hairs on Hackett 's neck began to rise . He heard Higgins breathing rather heavily somewhere near . The creakings , a subdued rattle of rusty wheels , the soft voices died away . It was a mild spring night , but Hackett felt cold . They were gone . WithHe felt for Mendoza . " Luis ? What in hell  --  " " O.K. , " said Mendoza . " They 'll be ten minutes or sogetting that one in the back door of the hotel . You have very timely afterthoughts , Art . Once I leaped to the incredibleconclusion , I thought it might be just possible  --  Oscar being Oscar  --  that something might be due to happen tonight . I got here just in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the first load . Come on , let 's have a look . " He produced a flashlight but did n't switch it on . " They 'll have left the back door open . " They had . The three of them slipped quietly in , but the door creaked nonetheless , and Hackett nearly jumped again . " Luis , you do n't mean  --  " he said . The flashlight played briefly on ancient kitchen fixtures , the black gaping rectangular hole of an open inner door to the hall.  | " I 'm reminded , " said Mendoza bodilessly out of the dark , " of a funny story  --  you know the one  --  " " My God , jokes at a time like  --  " "  --  about Sullivan coming to console Mrs. O'Neill , with O'Neill on his deathbed . Tells her the doctors know so much nowadays , her husband 's going to get well in no time , be just as good as he ever was , soon be back at work and a fine upstanding healthy fellow again  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then just as he 's leaving he looks at the narrow front staircase and says , Christ , what a place to get a coffin out of ! ' Here we are . " Another gaping rectangular blackness . The flashlight pointed at it . The room with the coffins . Spread out on the floor . Only " There were more than that  --  this afternoon . " Hackett heard his own whisper . " Two more , " said Mendoza . " Our friends have just carted the second one back home . Let 's see . " The light played around . " Six left . " He walked into the room and bent over the first coffin , a great dark ominous black shape there . " Mmh . " The light steadied , pinned to thecoffin top . " Dorothy Esther McLaughlin , 1891-1949And who 's this ? Well , well , stranger to us . Robert Talbot , d. 1941 . . . And here 's brother William . William McLaughlin , 1883-1954 . I wonder if Stephen 's somewhere here too . My God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pues si . And  --  " " For the love of Christ ! " said Higgins . " Are you saying  --  " He took an involuntary step backward . " When you told me about that name plate , Art , I suddenlythought about that room on the fourth floor , and also what little Oscar said that morning we broke the newsp153to  --  Quiet . Here they come . Let 's give them a little surpriseparty . " Reluctantly Hackett and Higgins joined him in the room , on either side of the door . Faint voices . "  --  an upset . All because of Ellie . Bringing the police down on us . When that Mexican one said that about a search warrant , I really thought I should be sick  --  " " And if you'da told me about it then  --  " Ben . " I coulda told you  --  silly damn idea go knock him on the head . Would n't stop the rest of ' em . " " I will be glad when this is all over . Just like Ellie  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , poor woman . " Pencil-thin beam of light , pausing in the doorway . Vague dark outlines of the three of them there . One figure bending , tugging . " I rather think this must be Earl , it 's lighter . Poor Earl  --  so young to  --  " Hackett felt the hair was standing straight up on his head . A second figure was just bending over the first when Mendoza switched on his own powerful flashlight . " Have you got a client at last , Mr. McLaughlin ? " he asked suavely , and from pinpointing Oscar rapidly swung the light around to show Hackett and Higgins . " We would be so interested to hear all about it . " Oscar uttered a high-pitched scream and fainted across the coffin before him . But in the end it was Oscar who was most voluble . They carted the three of them off to Headquarters , where Ben Kelly just glowered at them and refused to answer any questions at all ; and Henry 's burden was " I said muchp154better to leave them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he 's got me into ! " But , revived , Oscar was almost pathetically eager to talk . His hot little brown eyes pleaded for understanding ; he gestured emotionally . " You do n't understand how it was ! Of course I know what the law says about bodies , but does n't any of you remember how it was  --  the depression  --  You 've got to see how it happened ! Earl  --  poor Earl  --  he was only thirtyfour  --  thatwas back in nineteen thirty-two  --  and it 's just terrible to have to tell you  --  we were brought up strictly , but the times  --  and living down here  --  such awful peoplesome of them were , and I 'm afraid he got into bad company  --  justa tiny bit drunk and fell down the front stairs and I saw at once his neck was  --  I was just qualified then . And , my goodness , do n't you see , a funeral would have cost  --  well , there simply was n't any money for it ! I had actually been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put every spare penny into my schooling , becausewe thought a regular business  --  but I had n't had any clients at all . And there were the taxes on the hotel  --  not much , and Ellie usually managed to help with her store  --  we had to keep the taxes up or we would n't have had a roof over our heads ! You see that . And the cost of a funeral  --  even then , those times  --  Well , we talked it all over , you see  --  the family , I mean  --  and we did n't see any reason why not  --  The whole problem solved so easily and the money saved for the taxes  --  Quite practical really , except of course for the body , but I thought of the top story  --  and I do assure you everything was always done according to law , except for actual burial . Absolutely hygienic . I 'm a good undertaker , I know my job , the coffins were lined with lead , and just in case I lined that room with  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply told people Earl had gone  --  You see how it was  --  " " And you just went on the same way ? " asked Mendoza , unwillingly fascinated . Oh , well , Ellie had n't believed in doctors , said Oscar vaguely . Jane was different , but they could n't ever afford  --  And Dorothy had n't been going to a doctor either ; that had looked very much like a heart attack to him . " We do have to know some medicine , you know . " And , besides , Stephen and William were both gone by then : Stephen had liver trouble and Willie , Oscar thought , had had a stroke , and each time it had all gone off without any trouble . " Of course I had everything to hand , and really , I assure you , we held a nice little service for all of them  --  not that we were raised in any sect  --  Father was a lifelong agnostic  --  but the proper respect due the poor dead clay was  --  " " Who , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , well  --  " Oscar floundered into long-winded explanations . First there had been an old woman , Amanda Tucker , who 'd lived at the hotel , gone out cleaning for her living , found dead in bed one day when no one had seen her for a while and someone looked  --  and she had n't had any money and  --  " Well , yes , I did know that the authorities would take care of it if I  --  but , after all , I am an undertaker , and really it seemed easier , and besides one likes to keep one 's hand in , and so I just  --  " Mendoza looked at Hackett . The routine Oscar had fallen into . In lieu of legitimate clients . Mr. Brown , it emerged , had been another roomer  --  died only three months ago . And now Oscar was chatteringabout Ben 's brother . " If I can make you understand  --  all done with respect and taste  --  But of course I did know how the law reads , but so narrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I was so upset when I heard you say about searching , and I only thought  --  " " You attacked me that night , Mr. McLaughlin ? " " I 'm very , very sorry , " said Oscar earnestly . " I see now it was a foolish thing to do . Henry said so . And I 'm not a violent man , I felt quite sick . But  --  " Hackett looked at Mendoza . He still felt that his hair was trying to stand up on end . Zanies , Higgins said . My God . Henry knowing . Ben knowing . Jane  --  Eliza  --  who else ? Probably not the rest of them . Oscar , the frustrated undertaker , without clients  --  taking what came to hand . The labor of love . The poor old ones , no family , drifting to the Celtic Hotel . Unknowingly , into Oscar 's tender hands . And , come to think , Oscar living up there on the fourth floor with his clients . God . Oscar a little bit more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , routine duty , to break the sad news : Oscar so taken aback , so indignant . Ellie dying away from home , in her secondhand store . If Ellie had delayed dying until she got homeOf course eventually it would have come to light . The will , the deed to the business block , theOr would it ? The coffins  --  and their contents  --  had been duly delivered to the morgue . Hackett could hear what Bainbridgewould say . " If I could just make you understand  --  " said Oscar . He looked ready to cry . People , people . Coming all sorts forever . You really never could figure what you 'd run into next.  |p157Mendoza  got home at four-thirty Monday morning and woke Alison to tell her all about it . She sat up in bed huggingher knees , looking alternately horrified , incredulous , and amused. "  --  and when we finally got Ben to say anything , well , it seemed his brother died , and there was n't any money for a funeral , and besides he 'd been paroled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board knew  --  and Oscar offered his little labor of love and he said it seemed the best thing to do . Said he supposed now we 'd stick him back in , and he sure was going to miss that monkey  --  cute little cuss . " Mendoza yawned . " So  --  " " Honestly ! " said Alison . " You 're not serious . " " Oh , you have n't heard it all yet . " Mendoza was buttoninghis pajamas . " I did n't really think it was urgent to charge Jane , who undoubtedly knew all about it too  --  Ip158had to look up the statute , it comes under the Board of Health  --  but we had to dispatch a couple of ambulances after the coffins and a couple of squad cars for extra manpowerin getting them aboard . So just as we 're thinking of going home , about one-thirty , one of the squad cars called in , so we all chased over to the hotel again  --  " " Why ? " " Jane , " said Mendoza . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cigarette . " Violently ill . All the women flutteringaround  --  the Rialto woman the only one kept her head , of course . It looked like touch and go , one of the interns said , and they rushed her over to the General , of course it was all very sudden and mysterious  --  we did get out of Manning that all she 'd had for supper was tea and toast  --  and I suddenly got it into my head , did somebody have it in for all the McLaughlins ? Vendetta or something ? So I wanted to know what had happened to Jane . I sent Art and George home , but I hung around to see  --  This is the damnedest thing I ever sat in on , which is about all we 've been doing . Foxglove , for God 's sake . And nowiVayapor Dios ! " " d Que. occure ? " asked Alison impatiently . " For heaven 's sake do n't tell me Jane was poisoned too ? " " Oh , but , yes , she was . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour or so  --  not a young woman . And of course they wanted to know the cause too , on account of antidotes and so on , and rushed the stuff down to the lab , and I really do ask you ! " said Mendoza , between exasperation and amusement . " This time it was oleander . " " Oleander ! The  --  " " Nerium oleander . Grows everywhere . Big tall shrub . " " I know . I had the gardener put in several of them along the back  --  Is it poisonous ? Good heavens , and thep159twins chasing around out there  --  " Alison looked alarmed . " They put everything in their mouths  --  " Mendoza also looked alarmed . " We 've got the damn things here ? You 'll call the gardener and have him dig them out tomorrow . Today . " " I most certainly will , " said Alison . Sheba , Bast and Nefertiti , who were curled in a complicated pile at the foot of the king-sized bed , had not stirred ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair in the corner , was muttering profanities at being disturbed . " But how on earth had  --  " " No idea , " said Mendoza , shrugging . " Manning just looked vague and said she 'd washed the dishes . God knows  --  it could have been put in some of the patent medicine she was dosing herself with , or the tea . Or anything . But what it says to me , obviously , is that our X is somebody in that hotel . " " With a grudge against the McLaughlins , " said Alison . " Um , yes . Lord , the McLaughlins . You ca n't believe such a  --  " " And I hope I remember , " said Mendoza through anotheryawn , " first thing I must do tomorrow  --  today  --  is tell the Humane Society about Gertrude . And the monkey . Yes . Well , if that is so , at least Oscar and Henry are safely stashed away in jail . And that means  --  hell , I 'll have to see the coroner first thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purely formal inquest , skip the family . Short and sweet . " " You 'll be dead on your feet if you do n't get some sleep . What a thing . " Mendoza reached for the lamp switch . " Do n't let me sleep past eight . The damn coroner  --  " By nine he had had an interview with the coroner ; hep160had called the Humane Society and been assured that someone would go round at once to rescue Gertrude and the monkey . Hackett drifted in at nine-thirty , and Mendoza suggested that he look up that lawyer , Adam Carson , who 'd drawn up Eliza 's will . Hackett agreed it would be a good idea . " What a night . I can hardly believe all that yet . You and my wife have a peculiar sense of humor , she thought it was funny too . My God . " " I always do appreciate Charles Addams , " said Mendoza . " Where 's George ? " " Not in yet . Farrell 's got some more plate numbers for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combinations that fellow might have misread as JGN-79o . This time they 've come up with an actors ' agent in Beverly Hills , some woman up in Oakland , and a doctor in Costa Mesa . " " That 's wild , " said Mendoza . He 'd like to get the hitrunjoker who 'd accounted for Patrolman Harry Cohen too , but the chances looked slim ; and , what with one thing and another , the McLaughlins had been occupying his mind to the exclusion of anything else . " I 've got to be at that inquest . You go find the lawyer . " " He wo n't tell us much , " said Hackett unprophetically , and drifted out . The coroner had agreed to a curtailed session , just formalidentification and medical testimony , so Bainbridge was the chief witness . And what he had to say  --  somewhat studiously avoiding Mendoza 's eye  --  brought Mendoza to the edge of his chair . It seemed that Dr. Bainbridge , interested in this offbeathomicide , had been doing a little homework . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  |p161but  I 've looked at all I could find and examined the  --  er  --  properties of the raw plant , and the evidence seems quite conclusive that in order to cause actual death the infusion must be  --  er  --  cumulative . " " You mean it must be administered over a period of time , Doctor ? " " Well , yes . It 's accumulative in the system . Either continueddoses of it or a sudden withdrawal will be accompanied by symptoms of poisoning , and of course if more and more is taken , death will eventually result . " " Have you formed any opinion as to how long a period and how massive a dosage might be required to bring about this result ? " " Well , to a certain extent . It 's difficult to say with any preciseness , and the individual reaction  --  But I should say she 'd been having doses of it for at least a month and possibly longer . I could n't offer any suggestion as to quantitybeyond a very general guess . Approximately , I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least . " " I see . " The coroner made a note . Mendoza was staring at the surgeon incredulously . As he 'd expected , the open verdict : short and sweet . He caught Bainbridge in the corridor outside . " Listen , are you telling me now  --  " " I said nobody knows much about it , " said Bainbridge defensively . " How would I know offhand ? But I like to be accurate , after I 'd finally identified it and told you , I looked up all the authorities I could find , and the consensus . . . " " You 're telling me the woman had to have repeated doses of this stuff  --  maybe even daily  --  " " That 's what it looks like . And I 'm not the detective , but it does occur to me that the vast majority of poisonings  --  deliberate , that is  --  are domestic . Somebody who hadp162access to her possessions or spiked some medicine she was taking regularly or  --  " " She did n't take any medicines , damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit of drinking coffee or tea with her meals ? Or Coke or something in between ? I 'm not the detective , " said Bainbridge with a shrug . " All I can give you is the medical evidence . " " Oh , hell and damnation , " said Mendoza . He looked at the tubby little surgeon without affection . " My only comfortis that you 've got a very pretty little job waiting for you at the morgue . " " Another one ? What is it this time ? " asked Bainbridge ironically . " My good God , man , go and see , " said Mendoza ... But this did in a way reinforce his ideas about malice domestic . By all they had , Eliza had not been in the habit of drinkinganything in her store except water from the tap ; even if she 'd habitually gone up to the drugstore in midmorningfor coffee or a Coke , it would have been impossible to spike that . So it looked as if she must have got the doses at home , somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it caught up to her . Manning ? He thought about Vera Manning . Just how lunatic was she ? She looked harmless enough , but she had apparently been closest to Eliza at home . In the hotel . God , he thought , I wish I 'd never heard of the Celtic Hotel and the McLaughlins . The various police forces Landers had sent requests to were now coming through with some answers  --  on Monday morning  --  and one answer looked rather promising . Brady , the bus driver , had said Rio Dell , Willits or Ukiah ; and here was a sergeant on the Willits force reporting that last Tuesday evening a girl named Alice May Cooke , ap163resident of Willits , had left by bus for Los Angeles intending to look for work there . Relatives in Willits , her parents , address appended . The parents had received a postcard from her postmarked Wednesday , March third , announcingher safe arrival . Landers tossed the teletype over to Piggott . " Could be Mary Brown all right . She would n't have told her parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small town  --  typical  --  and if she thought she was going to get the guy to marry her  --  " " Yeah , " said Piggott . " Less scandal  --  do it down here . Stay here until after the baby comes . Or , " said Landers suddenly , " I just thought  --  how about this ? That hotel gets a lot of salesmen in and out . Sure , I know , it 's corny  --  the old gag about the traveling salesman  --  but I can see that , ca n't you , Matt ? The nice innocent small-town girl , and the goodlookingfellow just passing through , making up to her  --  and maybe he 's mentioned this hotel here  --  " " Yeah , " said Piggott again . " But before we begin buildingany stories about it , let 's find out whether this girl was Mary Brown . Did n't you read the tail end of this ? Says this Alice Cooke has an aunt living here  --  over on Silver Lake Boulevard . If this is or is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she got in ? Called her at least . Maybe not if she figured on meeting this guy . But if this is Mary Brown and she did call , maybe she told the aunt a few things we 'd like to know . " " It does n't say the aunt knew she was coming , " Landers pointed out . " But I suppose  --  And besides , of course , the aunt would know from the picture  --  " " You 're really operating on all two cylinders this morning , are n't you ? " said Piggott . " So come on , let 's go see if she 's home . "  |p164But  on the ride up to Hollywood Landers was preoccupied . Silver Lake Boulevard reminded him of Mary Dwyer and the kids , because they lived there too . It had been Bert Dwyer  --  one hell of a nice guy  --  who 'd persuadedTom Landers to try for rank . And who knew how Mary 'd feel  --  probably , if she ever married again , it 'd be anybody but another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Higgins , who was also a hell of a nice guy , to make it . It 'd be good for the kids , and Higgins had a heart as big as he was , if well hidden under the very tough exterior . Only MarySo they found the aunt 's address  --  a Mrs. Wilfred Roberts she was  --  and she was home , and also home was Alice May Cooke , a nice small-town girl who was terribly thrilled the police had come to see her , thinking she 'd been murdered , but she had n't been really , and she 'd meant to go to a hotel but Aunt May had insisted she stay with her , and just why on earth the police thought " False alarm , " said Piggott . " So Brady did n't have Mary Brown as a passenger . " " We 've still , " said Landers , " got bus drivers and conductorsto see . " Privately he still liked his small idea about the hotel . The traveling salesmen . He thought about it . Not a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . Ask the desk clerk about regulars , men who frequently stayed there ? And then try to trace them back ? God , what a job . Just a little more difficult and complicated than this deadly routine they were at now . " Say , " Piggott was saying , " did you hear about that funny business last night  --  that McLaughlin case ? Farrell was telling me  --  " " Oh , yes , " said Adam Carson . " I do remember . Though P165I only saw her twice . " He was interested . " Police ? What 's your interest ? " Hackett explained economically , suppressing yawns . ( God , what a night . ) There had n't been much in the papers about Eliza  --  they had n't given the press much  --  but after the inquest this morning ( probably some bored junior newsman there ) interest might erupt : the offbeat case . " Oh , really ? " said Carson . " Well , what can I tell you  --  did you say Sergeant ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a will drawn up . It 's dated August of last year . " " That 's right , " said Carson . His office was on Spring Street ; the office , and Carson himself , said he was doing all right in a modest kind of way . Small office , small man : little dapper fellow about five-five , with friendly eyes , who looked with enormous interest at the big beefy homicide sergeant sitting opposite . " I only saw her twice , " he repeated , " but I felt sorry for the woman . People  --  little people . " He gestured . " I never asked her how she happened to come to me . Could very well be she picked my name at random out of the phone book . " He shrugged . " Anyway , she made an appointment , and all she wanted was the will drawn up . Simple will . I assume you 've seen it , what 's in it . " " Yes . You remember any details of what she said and so on ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carson smiled . " I remember Mrs. McCann , Sergeant . We do get all sorts of clients , but some of them  --  stand out . For this or that reason . There she sat , you know  --  such an ordinary-looking woman , dowdy clothes , cheap , no make-up , and one of those harsh voices  --  polite word 's forthright , ' about her whole manner  --  you know what I mean . "  | " I know what you mean . Yes , she 'd have been like that , " said Hackett , thinking over Eliza 's history . " Looked as if she would n't have five dollars to leave anybody , but you never know , do you ? She told me what she wanted to go in the will . I had to ask her specifically about the estate  --  what it consisted of . She was very reluctant to part with any information at all , but  --  " " She would have been . But you got it out of her ? " Carson said musingly , " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretive woman  --  kept saying she could n't see why I had to know all that , could n't I just put down everything of which I die possessed , ' something like that  --  but she did say one or two things that  --  " " There was n't any mention of jewelry in the will . Did she mention any to you ? " " Jewelry ? Certainly not , and she was the last woman I 'd have connected  --  Well , what I remember chiefly are two  --  er  --  things , " said Carson . " When she gave me the names and addresses of the legatees , she said  --  this harsh , plain way of talking , you know  --  that she did n't know who else to leave it to , and it was n't that she was so fond of these friends , but she was n't going to see any of it go to her family . I tried to persuade her to let me put in the old business  --  you know  --  one dollar to each member of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she would n't have it at any price . They were n't to have a penny of it . She said one of her brothers was a ghoul and the other one was a fool . I remember that all right . And her sister was another fool , mucking up her system with medicines . Was she  --  the McCann woman  --  one of these health-food addicts ? I just wondered . She went on at some length about how healthy she was because she took a positive attitude and got proper exercise and never took any medicine  --  that sort of thing . "  | " Did she mention her husband , Mr. Carson ? " " Oh , yes . I asked , of course , what her marital status was , because if he was living and still legally married to her it would affect the  --  Just so . She showed me a letter from him saying he 'd divorced her  --  I took down the details , of course  --  in Reno in nineteen thirty-something . I checked the Reno records to be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upped the fee a trifle , and she complained about that . But we do like to be sure of these things . " " They were definitely divorced ? Legally ? " " Oh , yes . " Well , thought Hackett , that was one question answered at least . " And what was the other thing you rememberedabout her , Mr. Carson ? " " Well , it was rather odd  --  " Carson hesitated . " But she was an odd woman . Let me think now and try to remember it all exactly . I asked her if she had a safety-deposit box to keep the will in with other important papers , and she said she had a good place ' to put it . Well , I did n't much like the sound of that , you know  --  a secretive old lady like that . In my experience there 's no knowing where they 'll hide important documents  --  " " It was in a copy of Bartlett 's Quotations , " said Hackett dryly . Carson shut his eyes and said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , I suppose . Well , I told her I 'd be happy to keep it for her here , and she said there was n't any need . Just like that . She was standing at the door , about to leave  --  it was just after she 'd signed the will , you understand  --  and she said , in that fiat nasal voice , I 'm a strong woman , Mr. Carson , healthy and well , and I mean to live a long time . But I 'll know when my time 's coming  --  I 'll know because I 've never been sick a day , and when I start to sicken I 'll know , and then I 'll see my will 's givenp168into the proper hands and my friends told where to find things . And told if I do n't come to my store or see my friends any more , no matter what anybody tells them , they 're to tell certain people '  --  she emphasized that  --  ' certain things . ' I remember that because it was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it  --  likelikean avenging goddess , " said Carson , half laughing . " And I could swear to the actual words . " By God , thought Hackett , she 'd meant to blow the thing open  --  Oscar and his collection of coffins . But she 'd left it too late : did n't realize , of course , that she was going to be poisoned . Did n't realize she was " sickening . " Meant to give one of those women the will when she thought itwas time . . . In a bankbook there 's no love , gentlemen . Eliza . The three casual friends casually acquired  --  did n't know who else to leave it to , away from the family . The McLaughlins . " That 's all very interesting , Mr. Carson , " Hackett said thoughtfully . Higgins did n't get into the office until after Mendoza had left for the inquest , and technically he had n't any orders to carry out . he looked at the new plate numbers the D.M.V. had come up with and did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look as if they 'd get the joker who had run down Cohen . At this late date . Deliberate or not  --  and that idea was just wild . He thought he might use a little time today to contact Alfred Clark . The Y.M.C.A. thing . Clark had seemed like a nice guy . He found Alfred Clark 's hardware store in Pasadena , reintroduced himself , and said he had a little favor to ask and could he buy Clark a cup of coffee , maybe ? " A favor ? " said Clark . " Did you say Sergeant ? Well , sure ,  |p169anything  I can do for you  --  I guess I can take fifteen minutesoff , down the street at Nick 's  --  " There was a clerk at the other side of the store . The very funny damn part of it was , Higgins thought gloomily , that God knew he 'd never been backward with females . Him , George Allen Higgins , scared to death to ask her to go out to dinner with him for fear she 'd say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . But Mary , of course , was n't just another female . She was , well , Mary . She was also Bert Dwyer 's widow . And Bert had been a pal of his . One very good guy . But , aside from that , Higgins liked kids . He liked Bert 's kids . And Stevie wanted to go to summer camp , and Mary could n't afford it . He gave an expurgated version to Alfred Clark , leaving Mary out of it mostly and emphasizing Bert and the kids , and Clark was interested and amused . " I see . You do n't want her to know you 're  --  " " Well , she 's a very independent woman , " said Higgins . Which she was . " She 'd never let me  --  well , naturally , you/ see that . But Steve 's father was a good friend of mine  --  . he got shot by a bank robber six months back  --  and I 've got no responsibilities myself and I 'd like to  --  I just thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Like making it up there was a fund for fatherless boys , or  --  The only thing is they live in Hollywood and you 're with the Pasadena  --  " " Let me think about it , " said Clark . He grinned at Higgins . " Good Samaritan , you . " " That 's me , " said Higgins , thinking about Mary 's clear silver-gray eyes and how they smiled sometimes  --  not often enough  --  and her trim figure and black curly hair and her voice with the funny little break in it and how desperately much he loved her and wanted to look after them all , Maryp170and Steve and Laura and Brucie , the little Scotty , and the old comfortable house that was always needing new washersin its faucets and electrical repairs " World always needs good Samaritans , " said Clark in a friendly tone . " I know Bud Wilson over at the Hollywood Y. You let me talk to him , Sergeant . " His expression was sympathetic . " We 'll come up with something , I 'll bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Higgins started to thank him . Providence , undoubtedly , had led him to Alfred Clark.  |p171When  Mendoza came into Federico 's at twelve-thirty he found Grace , Landers and Piggott hanging enthralled on Hackett 's words , on a graphic description of the goings on at the Celtic Hotel last night . He sat down across from Grace , grinning . " Why did n't you call me , Lieutenant ? I 'd have given a year of my life to have been in on it . How right you are , cops might not get rich , but they do acquire stories to tell . " " Well , knowing how all you cullud folks feel about corpses  --  " said Mendoza . " Get along , suh , I got so 's I can pass a graveyand in broad daylight and nevah turn a hayuh , " said Grace in broad Dixie . He shook his head . " I 'll never think of that place by its right name . Coffin Corner . My God , the things we do run into . "  |p172A  waiter came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's prestige . We 've been sitting here ten minutes , but as soon as the lieutenant walks in  --  " " Sorry , sir , we 're busy like you can see . Drinks , gentle-men ? " Mendoza shook his head , ordered a small steak ; Landers said he 'd have a scotch and soda , Hackett shared that , Piggottlooked disapproving and ordered a steak sandwich , and Grace debated . " Trying to think of something appropriate , " he said . " In view of Oscar . There 's one called a Great Secret , but I kind of think  --  yes , you can tell Joe to fix me a Leave It To Me . " " A  --  yes , sir . " " Joe 's pretty good , I have n't stumped him yet , " said Grace blandly . " What 's in it ? Oh , English gin , dry vermouth , apricot brandy , lemon juice and a dash of grena-dine . " " Christ , " said Higgins , coming up and taking the chair next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Bring me a bourbon and water , " he added to the waiter . Hackett brought them up to date with what Carson had to say . " Interesting , " said Mendoza . " So she meant Oscar 's little labors of love to get found out . And I 've got news too . " And he told them about Dr. Bainbridge 's homework . " For God 's sake , " said Hackett , " you mean regular doses of the stuff ? It 's not enough we 've got to find out how somebodygot her to take it once ? " " That 's right . You have any ideas ? " " I have not , " said Hackett . " This is the damnedest  --  but I 'll say this , Luis , that definitely makes it look as if it 's got to be somebody at the hotel , and if you want a wild guess , I 'll say Manning . " " I do n't know , " said Grace ; " she 's the one seemed to like the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news . And she has n't got all her buttons , could she act a part ? " " Hell , I do n't know either , " said Hackett . " I 'm just looking at the facts . The way they 'd arranged things in that crazy household , if you 'd call it that , Eliza and the Manningfemale ate their meals together  --  fixed them together . Which says that Manning had the greatest opportunity to add something to the coffee or whatever . On the other hand , I suppose that also says that they mostly had the same meals . We can ask Oscar and Henry . " " Who might or might not know , " said Mendoza . " We can . I intend to . We might also ask Manning 's sister and get some more background on her . And there 's also Jane . Getting poisoned last night . That I 'm sure of . I asked the doctor at the General , and about this oleander they seem to know , he said they had cases rather often of kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . It 's a one-shot deal and acts fairly rapidly . He did say that she 'd had a large dose of it , more than would be the case if she 'd just chewed a few leaves . I asked him about making up an infusion of it  --  concentrate , as it were  --  and he said sure , that would be possible and would make the effectmmh  --  morevirulent . But he also said death from it is very rare except in the cases of very small children and she 'd had nowhere enough to kill her . " They digested that ; the drinks came , and Grace looked at the Leave It To Me thoughtfully . " Whoever had it in for Eliza seems to have been more efficient than that . " " We all have off days , " said Mendoza . " Are you getting anywhere on Mary Brown , Tom ? " " Do n't mention the name to me , " said Landers . " We 've still got all these bus drivers and conductors to see , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 1l rememberher on the bus or the train ... Oh , I suppose thep174routine 'll get us there in the end . On this McCann thing , the way I told you yesterday , that Thirkettle house was absolutely clean , and I ca n't figure the woman in on it . As Matt can say  --  we poked everywhere  --  " " One of those persnickety housekeepers , " agreed Piggott . " What my mother calls nasty-nice . She mixes up brews , all right  --  a lot of bottles in the kitchen , all labeled , and she had some stuff boiling on the stove . Do n't think we did n't ask  --  even took samples for the lab  --  and I can hear what the boys are saying about that . One of ' em was boiled-up poppy seeds , for instance , painkiller , said Thirkettle . And something called common fumitory for acid indigestion . " " The one I liked , " said Landers , swallowing Scotch , was the purple loosestrife . You ever hear of it ? Neither had I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just something sort of exotic-sounding about purple loosestrife . " " What 's it supposed to be good for ? " asked Grace curiously . " Eye trouble , she said . " " You ask me , " said Piggott , " it 's going roundabout . I would n't say there is n't something in those old cures , but any of ' em that are worth anything the researchers know about , and why go to the bother of all that fussing with poppy seeds and so on when you can go buy a bottle of aspirin ? " " It 's a hobby , I suppose you 'd call it , " said Landers . " Anybody can have a funny hobby . But the woman did n't strike me as a likely killer , did she you , Matt ? " " Well , you never know . She is one of the legatees under the will . " " Yes , " said Mendoza , looking at the steak just set before him , " and some of what you got from Carson , Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ? Confident she 'd know ' when her time was near , when she 'd hand the will over to those three . She seems to have been an efficient sort of woman in a way , but that says to me that she was getting  --  mmh  --  delusions of omniscience , shall we put it ? Hiding that will in a book  --  where , as Alison so rightly said , it might easily never have been found . The diamonds under the grating in the hearth  --  1 Caray ! Even my grandmotherknew better than that ! And if she 'd been thinking straight , she 'd have known that anybody  --  never sick a day or not  --  can have a heart attack . " " Well , she was a McLaughlin too , " said Hackett . " Maybe a trifle more sense than the others , but still a Mc-Laughlin . " " Coffin Corner , " said Grace . " My God . " " Well , it just struck me , " said Mendoza , " that , by all that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to how she 'd feel . She 'd accumulated the small fortune by her own unaided efforts , while the rest of them were living on practically nothing  --  aimless , hardly planningahead a day . Feckless . And even more of a triumph , maybe , for Eliza was that she 'd kept it a great secret . What a laugh she 'd have on them , even from beyond the grave  --  or the fourth floor of the hotel !  --  when they found out , and found out they would n't come in for a cent of it . What I 'm getting at is just possibly Eliza was so confident that she was the hell of a lot smarter than anybody around her that it was all that much easier to trick her in some way . She might not have suspected that anybody would try to pull something on her . " " One little thing , " said Grace , finishing the Leave It To Me . " She must have felt some symptoms , taking the stuff over a period . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time was approaching , say  --  and see the will made open , tell one of those three about the crown jewels ? " Mendoza said , " They do say none so blind '  --  And then you 've got to consider human nature , Jase . " " That you 've always got to remember , all right . What particular aspect of it you mean ? " " These obnoxious mens sana in corpore sano fiends . One of them , " said Mendoza , " sprains his ankle , he 'll go on denying there could be anything wrong . " " Oh , " said Hackett . " I get you . That could be . " Landers sighed and said he 'd better get on with all the bus drivers and conductors . Alison called Angel to tell her about the oleander . " Heavens , " said Angel , " we 've got an enormous one against the rear fence  --  a young tree . And Mark puts everything in his mouth  --  do you mean to say  --  ? I 'll get Art to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing 's happened before we found out . . . Is n't this the craziest one they 've had yet ? Talk about Charles Addams . " Alison said some of it was rather pathetic but the bodies in the attic was really something . " Honestly , people . . . But what fascinates me is the foxglove . I 've no idea what it looks like , there could be a bed of it in the back yard and I would n't  --  Well , apparently that has to be prepared , boiled in water or something , is n't dangerous in the raw state , so to speak  --  but , Angel , down there ? Oh , some people in the little old residential streets have a patch of garden , but so much of it is all business , and there 's the freight yards , and  --  " " Oh , I had a lovely thought about that , " said Angel . " I wondered  --  No , Mark ! Leave the pussy alone !  --  about it too , of course , and I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , Alison , aside from the hypotheticalback yards , the only  --  Mark , did you hear what I said ?  --  there 's really only one place down there where there might be  --  " " Oh , " said Alison . " Oh , for heaven 's sake ! I can see Luis ' face . " She uttered a little scream as Sheba landed on her from behind . " Little monster . Of course . Elysian Park . Where  --  " " Where , " said Angel , " the Police Academy is . Spang in the middle . I can hear what Art would say . X strolling past the Academy , where all those earnest young rookies are studying police science , and gathering the foxglove  --  " They both burst out laughing . Mendoza went over to the new facility on Alameda , where Oscar and Henry were incarcerated , and started to question Oscar about all of Eliza 's habits . Before he got down to business , he had to answer a lot of questions from Oscar  --  about what sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a lawyer  --  and when he finally got Oscar to pay attention he did n't get much . All the McLaughlins seemed to be essential egotists , completely wrapped up in themselves and half blind to other people . Oscar did n't really know much about Eliza 's habits at meals or any other time . Coffee , he said vaguely , yes , she drank coffee , but she had one pot she and Miss Manning used and he and Henry had their own . Well , he could n't say whether she and Miss Manning always had the same thing at meals , but he thought not always because he did remember that Eliza did n't like chicken and at least once that he could recall he was in the kitchen when they were eating and Miss Manning was having creamed chicken . But he really could n't say  --  Oh , he did n't think Eliza ever had soft drinks in the store . Things like Coca/Cola . It was so expensive , and then the bottles were a nuisance . Sometimes in the summer she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did n't himself . " It gives me heartburn . Not that that was Ellie 's reason , of course , she was never sick and always boasting about it . I 'm subject to heartburn myself  --  so is Henry . Jane had some capsules once that seemed to help  --  one of her samples  --  but we never came across another sample offer and they were a dollar and a half a box  --  outrageous . I said to Henry at the time  --  " Mendoza prodded at him for an hour and went away with incipient heartburn himself . And despite his remarks about the annoyingly healthy people like Eliza  --  or perhaps he was the exception to prove the rule  --  he was another one like that but did no boasting about it . He was annoyed . These damn McLaughlins , he thought . Coffin Corner , indeed . A report came in from Glendale about three o'clock that a car had been picked up , not on the hot list anywhere in the county , with what looked like bloodstains on it . Higginswent out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather doubted that the hit-run car which had killed Cohen would still have blood on it . If it had n't been abandoned until now . But you never knew , and even in Glendale there were outlying little streets where it could have been sitting for several days without being noticed . But it had n't been that sort of street . Quite a busy residentialstreet , and a resident had called in to report the car had been sitting in front of his house for four days . The bloodstains , however , turned out to be inside the car , which was no use to Higgins on the Cohen case . The Glendaleboys had a little problem of their own . And , well , they had these things going to be worked ,  |p179but  he did n't see one blessed thing to do on the McLaughlinbusiness except ask a lot more questions , which he privatelythought would n't give them anything much at all , and Mendoza and Hackett and Grace would be doing that . Landers and Piggott were doggedly at the routine on Mary Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glasserwould probably be helping out Landers and Piggott . Palliser would probably come back some time this week : upset for him , thought Higgins , losing his mother so sudden ; they 'd been close , he knew . Probably Palliser and his girl Roberta would get married pretty soon now . And so maybe it was goofing off ( the nice spring weather ) , but Higgins drove back into Hollywood by Silver Lake Boulevardand stopped at Mary Dwyer 's house , and the kids had just got home from school , so he played ball awhile with Stevie while Laura practiced her piano lesson . Good kids . Laura wanted to play him a piece she 'd just learned . At least he 'd got the kids calling him George . " Gee , I 'm awf'lly glad I did n't have to stop piano like Mother said I would because we ca n't afford it . Was n't it lucky , George ? How you found Miss Jeanie that does n't cost as much ? " " Do n't say gee , " said Higgins . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 're getting better all the time , Laurie . " Nice kids . But he ought to be out earning his pay . To , among other things , go on mostly paying for Laura 's piano lessons  --  and if Mary ever found out  --  1He went back downtown . " Yeah , I think it coulda been , " said Mike Sullivan . He held the post-mortem picture of Mary Brown at arm 's length and studied it . " She 's dead , hah ? Poor little girl . It just coulda been her . I would n't like to swear . " " We have to check on everything , Mr. Sullivan , " saidp180Landers . " You think she could have been on your bus on that run ? " " I would n't swear , " said Sullivan . " Most of the passengersyou do n't hardly notice  --  only the ones make some complaint or like that . And one run 's pretty much like another . Only , well , the pretty girls a man kind of notices , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything about it . " He grinned . " Me , I got a pretty wife and three kids , but the girls I notice . Just to notice . Now you say it'd 've been that Tuesday or Wednesday , depends where she got on the bus . " " That 's right , Mr. Sullivan . " " Well , I took the bus outta Sacramento that Tuesday night at eleven-fifty . Figure it five hunnerd and twenty miles , coming over to the coast route , and I was due in the Greyhound station in L.A. at eight-forty A.M. Only I had engine trouble . " Sullivan looked disgusted . Landers had found him , at getting on to five o'clock , by his wife 's directions , in a neighborhood bar sitting over a beer . Sullivan had two days off before taking a bus out for Chicago tomorrow . " They keep ' em up , that do n't often happen , but there it was . I hadda lay over in San Luis . So I did n't get to L.A. until about two-thirty that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a lot of complaints , but I could n't help it  --  " " I see , " said Landers . " You think this girl could have been on this bus ? " " I do n't know if it was her . There was a girl about that age on that run  --  all I can say . I could n't tell you her name , naturally . A pretty girl . Coulda been that one . All I can say is she was one of ' em that acted reasonable  --  saw it was n't my fault . " " Do you remember if she got on at Sacramento or somewhere along the way ? "   " Oh , mister , I 'm not an encyclopedia . Or one o ' these computers . I made four runs since , and passengers , you do n't notice ' em much unless they make the complaint , raise a fuss of some kind . I just remember there was a goodlookin ' young girl on that run , which I only remember on accountta the engine trouble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Sullivan , " a tough job , but I guess so can yours , hah ? " " Brother , " said Landers , " you have said it . Well , thanks very much . " " Welcome , " said Sullivan . " Got ta be a good citizen . " Landers left him thirstily swallowing beer , went back to the office and sent off a teletype to the Sacramento boys . Had any young woman been reported missing who matched this description , or had such a young woman been known to have left town for L.A. or anywhere else ? He got out a state map , looked at it and sighed . At a conservativeguess , about forty places between Sacramento and here where she could have boarded that bus . He wondered what a bus driver 's life was like . In any job , he reflected , difficulties . Into each life some rain " Poisoned ! " said Jane McLaughlin dramatically . " I was poisoned ! Just like Eliza . I thought you were talking nonsense , young man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plot . " Mendoza had called General Hospital : the patient , he was told , was practically recovered and could be seen . She was , in fact , sitting up in the hospital bed , the loose hospitalgown slipping dangerously and revealing unhealthy bulges of soft white flesh , supremely unconscious of the other patients in the ward beyond the prim white screens round the bed . " What I wanted to ask you , Miss McLaughlin , " saidp182Mendoza , " was what you had to eat and drink last evening . From , say , six o'clock on to when you were taken ill . " " That Manning woman , " said Jane , nodding violently . " That is the answer undoubtedly . Ellie was quite mad , taking her in , and now she has her reward . The creature 's a complete lunatic . It was in the tea . That I am positive of . " " The tea ? You had tea and what else , Miss McLaughlin ? When ? " " Of course you want all the details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Of all the outrageous  --  it was undoubtedly the tea . The Thirkettle woman brought it . What ? No , no , young man , not yesterday  --  some while ago , last month sometime . A herbal tea  --  mate , I believe she called it  --  a green tea  --  Paraguayan  --  supposed to be very beneficial to the kidneys . Not one of her own making , no , she had actuallybought it as a present for Eliza , but Eliza did not care for it and gave it to me . Quite unprecedented , that ! But then Ellie was not one to waste anything . I ca n't say I cared much for the flavor , but there it was to be used up , and I 've been having it with my supper . I thought there was somethingpeculiar about the flavor of it last night , and I said so  --  and that Manning lunatic saying she 'd put in a pinch of clove to make it taste better ! Never suspected a thing until I began to feel sick  --  Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt irrelevantly he should thank her for the " young man . " After all , he 'd been twenty-odd years on the force . " Not yet , Miss McLaughlin . If you could tell me  --  " Thirkettle ? Thirkettle 's tea ? But what motive on earth could Tabitha Thirkettle have had against Jane ? And she could n't know Jane would wind up with the tea . And in any case if Jane had been drinking the tea with no ill effects up to last night " And why not , pray ? Trying to poison me  --  I told Ellie she was a fool , but all she could see was the money for takingcare of the woman  --  a lunatic like that  --  " Thirkettle , Manning ? The tea . Try to make sense of it , thought Mendoza . Try to collect the evidence ! In the corridor outside the room he caught an intern and asked when Jane could be released . Any time : she was all but fully recovered and they always needed the space . And he shuddered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arrested  --  accessory to the charge facing Oscar and Henry . The bodies in the attic . Coffin Corner , he thought.  |p184He  went back to the hotel with Grace . Glasser had taken the warrant on Jane over to the hospital . They found Vera Manning in her room , engaged in writing her love letters . " The tea ? " she said . " What tea ? " " The tea you made for Miss McLaughlin 's supper last night , " said Grace softly . " We 'd like to see the rest of it , ma'am . " " It 's in the kitchen . I 'm afraid I 'm not very good at cooking , even though Ellie 's tried to teach me . But when I have my own little home and have to cook for Albert  --  " " If you 'd just come and show us , Miss Manning , " said Mendoza . She drifted out to the kitchen ahead of them . An impossiblybig room , originally the restaurant kitchen , a goodp185thirty feet square , and everything in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pine boards , and it had n't been scrubbed in a long time . An ancient Kelvinatorstood against one wall , an equally aged Servel against another . A long unpainted wooden table down the center , a few straight chairs . And open shelves round all four sides of the room , littered with a miscellany of items : boxes of crackers and cookies and packaged bakery cakes , cans , instantcoffee and tea , breakfast food , half-empty jars of mustard , little wedges of waxed paper refolded to use over again , a topless box with lengths of string filling it higgledy-piggledy ( that was Eliza , Mendoza decided ) , a man 's sweater casually tossed down , a crumpled felt hat ; and ranged along one shelf the crockery and flatware , unmatchedchipped plates and saucers and cups , old cheaprestauranttinware , much of it bent ; and in the center of the rear wall an enormous black iron range that must , he thought , be all of fifty years old and possibly more . Nothing looked very clean . " There 's the tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the directions over . " Paraguayan green tea : mate , as Jane had said . In a commercialpackage with cellophane round it : " 59  --  " read the stamp on the top of the box . " What did you put in Jane 's tea last night , Miss Manning ? " asked Mendoza . " Why , she said she did n't like the taste of it , so I put a little clove in . I think it was clove . Maybe peppermint . She 's very annoying , interrupting me so often , she does n't realize how important it is to our brave soldiers to get letters from home . Did you know Gertrude 's gone ? And Robespierre . Two men came in a truck . They had an awful time catching Robespierre , they had to get a ladder  --  " " Yes , we know . What about the oleander , Miss Man-ning ? "  |p186Her  large pale eyes turned to Grace with vague speculation . " I do n't know , what about it ? " " The oleander leaves you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were any black men in the police force , it 's very interesting . I 'm afraid I do n't know what that is  --  what you said . I would like to finish my letter , " said Miss Manning . She looked oddly pathetic in the full light from the window , the over-tall gawky old woman in her torn dress and layers of bright-colored scarves , her ravagedface covered with heavy make-up . Suddenly she gave Mendoza a wide smile , revealing stained yellowed teeth . " Such a festive day when Albert comes home at last ! " she said brightly . " He 's been gone a long time  --  I ca n't even remember how long it is now  --  but the last letter I had , he said he hoped to be home for Christmas . It 's  --  it 's going to be Christmas soon , is n't it ? " " In a little while , " said Mendoza . He shrugged at Grace . " Miss Manning , " said Grace persuasively , " when you were fixing Miss McLaughlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen ? You remember ? " She looked vague . " Oscar was there , I think . Maybe Henry . I did n't know what to fix for myself  --  Ellie always decided . I do try , and Ellie was good to me , but I was n't brought up to housework and I 'm not very good at it . Jane said the water had n't been boiling . It 's so hard to tell when it is , you know . " She giggled . " I really must finish my letter  --  " They looked at each other . " You do that , " said Mendoza , and she drifted out . " We 'd never get anything out of her . But I continue to wonder just how lunatic she is . " " Me too . Do we know where her sister lives ? " " Mmh . There was a check in Eliza 's purse she had n't cashed yet . A Mrs. John Binny , up in Hollywood . Wep187might get some more background from her . But let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who spotted the little twig with several leaves still on it under the stove  --  old-fashioned stove on raised legs  --  nearly invisible against the grimy old floor . " Oleander . I do know that one  --  long thin leaf . " " And what does it say ? Several people use this stove every day . Could have been Oscar or Henry . " " Well , after all , " said Grace , grinning , " they had a programmapped out for last night . And a full night 's work too . You think either of them , even if they 'd decided Jane was better out of the way , would have planned it for last night  --  causing a certain amount of upset , Oscar 's favorite word , right while they were busy bringing all the coffins back home ? " Mendoza laughed . " There is that . Hell , it 's all up in the air . And in a place this size , my God , that Rialto woman could have slipped down in the dead of night to mix up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or  --  my God , Jase , d' you know we 've never so much as laid eyes on that Bobby ? The newsboy . Just because he has n't been around when we have  --  " " So we have n't . Spring fever , " said Grace . " But , then , the McLaughlins do tend to keep our attention focused on them . I suppose we ought to . And find out also just exactly who did know about the bodies in the attic . I wonder if Percy did . " " I do n't think so . The remittance man , sitting around Sam 's bar and grill . Too likely he 'd let it out , and Oscar may be eccentric  --  or even more than that  --  but he 'd know that danger . Yes , " said Mendoza thoughtfully , " so where next ? Damn it , on this one we ca n't even fall back on the routine ! "  |p188Mrs  . John Binny lived on Cahuenga Avenue in Hollywood , in a dignified middle-class apartment , and it dawned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the McLaughlins , was not native to Old High Street and environs  --  and also that Mrs. Binny , in paying Eliza McCann forty dollars a month to baby-sit with the erratic Miss Manning , had been getting one hell of a bargain . If Mrs. Binny had stashed her unsteady-witted sister away at a rest home , about the only other alternative , it could n't have cost her any less than two hundred a month at prevailing rates . And Mrs. Binny was looking extremely alarmed at the prospect of having to find new accommodations . She had n't known that Eliza was dead . " Of course , " she said thinly , " I could n't leave her there with only the men . Quite unsuitable . Dear me , how annoying  --  comingso suddenly , too . " She was almost as tall as her sister , a thin pale woman with a Roman nose and the same china-blue eyes . She did n't like police in her neat and clean living room , especially when they brought bad news . And , adding insult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican and the other Negro , of all things . They asked patient questions and got some answers which did n't tell them much . Vera Manning had been  --  " afflicted , " said Mrs. Binny delicately  --  since her poor fiance had been killed in the First World War . She had then been twenty-six . " Always delicate , of course . " She had been living with Mrs. McCann at the Celtic Hotel for nearly twenty years . Mrs. Binny 's parents had known the older McLaughlins . " I knew the family , of course  --  such a dreadful thing to lose all they had like that , and it was really an excellent arrangement . Vera seemed quite con/tented , and it had become impossible to have her in my  --  " Nice normal home : they could finish that . " Of course I paid her board and paid Mrs. McCann a sum for  --  " " Had you been paying Mrs. McCann the same amount all that time , Mrs. Binny ? " asked Mendoza . A little spasm contracted the woman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was far less at first  --  but when prices began to go up so drastically , Mrs. McCann did mention that it did n't quite cover  --  and we finally agreed on  --  I beg your pardon ? Oh , that was about seven years ago , I  --  " Eliza good at dickering . Everything grist that came to her mill . She seemed to have been good enough to the Manning woman in her own way . And just how " afflicted " was Manning , anyway ? Competent enough to do the simplemarketing , left on her own most of the day usually  --  writing her letters ? Occasionally walking down to join Eliza at the store , a good fifteen blocks , without getting lost . " I beg your pardon ? A psychiatrist ? Oh , dear me , no , we never  --  When she first showed signs of  --  ah  --  her affliction , well , it was obvious  --  we did n't wish to  --  I beg your pardon ? " She recoiled from Mendoza 's question fastidiously . " Violent ? Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Really , you ca n't be thinking that Vera was responsiblefor whatever happened to Mrs. McCann  --  why , that 's quite outrageous ! Of course she 's never been  --  " But never given any treatment . How much of that , wonderedMendoza , was a half-unconscious reversion to childishmake-believe , the irresponsibility ? The real Vera Manning , if you pinned her down , might just find life easier and more comfortable by pretending to inhabit her unreal little world while a part of her remained fully conscious of what was going on around her.  |p190But  one thing they could be sure of . Of everybody who knew Eliza , Vera 's sister was at least one they could mark off as having no reason to want her dead . " I suppose , " said Grace on the sidewalk outside , " we could have her looked at by a head doctor . " " And get a lot of double talk , " said Mendoza irritably . " Which would tell us exactly nothing . She 's an impossible subject for a lie-detector test , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , also belatedly , they went down to Second and Grand and hauled in Bobby the newsboy . Who turned out to be a stout forty-year-old with a mental age of around eight , perfectlyamiable and cooperative to the best of his ability . Patiently they asked him questions  --  or , rather , Grace did . Bobby , like so many people , responded to something in easygoing , tender-voiced Detective Grace . " Oscar , sure , " he said . " It 's Oscar I give the money to . For my room . He tells me day to pay money . " He knew , he demonstrated eagerly , about money : dimes and pennies and nickels and quarters and half dollars . He could make change good . He knew where to go , get the papers to sell first thing in the morning , and a man brought more papers later . " Mmh-hmrn , " said Grace . " And you live at the Celtic Hotel , Bobby ? " Bobby looked blank and said again he paid Oscar for his room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the first stairs and counted the doors and it was number eight you came to . He looked blank again when Grace asked how long he 'd lived there . " You did n't always live at that place , did you , Bobby ? " asked Grace gently . After painful thought , Bobby said , " No . Ma  --  Ma andp191me  --  it was before Ma went away . She told me all how to do , before , and I do just like she allus told me . " He looked earnestly at Grace . " About selling the papers and everything . And always be polite to people . And a bath ever ' Satiddaynight . And remember walk straight down Broadway , till two blocks pas ' the Mission Church , an ' then it 's on'y a block down to home . Where our room is . I remembermost things good . " Grace straightened up from where he 'd been bending over Bobby , sitting in a straight chair . That told the story . The mother settling them there , God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best he could to live by rote : and , aside from his amiability , one like Bobby would hardly have been the one to brew the homemade poison for Eliza  --  or for Jane . He looked even blanker at mention of both names , and they realized he might very well seldom have set eyes on Eliza and never on Jane . Jane always upstairs , in her room mostly , and Eliza at her store or in her room . And Bobby probably out selling papers on Sundays too . He was vague about the names of the days , but he enlargedon that for them obligingly . " Sell the papers until all gone . But I like all the pretty lights , night comes  --  walk up the street , see all the pretty lights . And people . " Oscar had said something about Bobby 's being out at all hours . He looked at Grace anxiously now . " But I do n't know this place . I be lost , you do n't take me back to my place . " His place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , innocentlife . Whoever she 'd been , Bobby 's mother had done her best for him in her way . " You take me back ? " " We 'll take you back , Bobby , " said Grace . " Where do you eat , Bobby ? Breakfast and lunch and dinner ? "  |p192Parrotlike  , Bobby told him . " The corner up next from where I sell papers . Old man there  --  his name 's Joe  --  nice old man . He knows Ma . They was men come took her away on a flat thing all white and she never come back . " Momentarily his cherubic face crumpled . " But Joe , he gives me breakfast , lunch , dinner . Other folks too . Fixes for everybody come in . I know the money . Three dimes and a nickel  --  breakfast . Two quarters  --  lunch . A half dollarand a dime and two nickels  --  dinner . Good . Joe 's nice to me . Most people awful nice . Ma said . You be nice to people , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only I sometimes do n't remember all the words she said . I try remember . Please , pretty soon you take me back , I got a lot more papers to sell . " " O.K. , I 'll take you back now , Bobby , " said Grace . " You just wait a few minutes . " He and Mendoza went out of the interrogation room to the corridor . " So that 's that . " " The flotsam and jetsam , " said Mendoza , " you find in the jungle  --  God . That kind . I suppose if any of the social workers knew about him they 'd stash him away somewhere . Wonder he has n't been knocked on the head some night for the few bucks on him . " Detective Grace said , " I do n't know , Lieutenant . Maybe Bobby 's got a charmed life . Short on brains , but maybe  --  I sometimes think  --  the loving heart 's a little more important . Bobby seems to get along O.K. , doing just like Mama taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit more about what this is supposed to be all about than you or me or the Chief . " Mendoza looked at him . Grace smiled and added , " Not that I 'd go preaching at you . Just a thought . I 'll take him back to his newspapers and take twenty minutes to stop inp193at Bullocks ' to look at those watches the sergeant was mentioning . For Virginia 's birthday . " And another little puzzle : who was going to arrange Eliza 's funeral with all her relatives sitting in jail ? Well , that was their problem , Mendoza reflected . At three o'clock that afternoon Hackett came into the office with the information that Eliza had not , after all , flouted Uncle . Inquiries at the local I.R.S. office had turned up the information that she had filed tax returns through a tax accountant . " Fellow named Stein over on Third Street , hole-in-the-wall office . I saw him just now . She was strictly business , he says  --  furnished him all the facts and figures , and acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which figures . " "  --  and that was that . But it was a revelation to me , " said Hackett , " and I 'm seriously thinking about a downpaymenton some rental property . He says , what with the value depreciation allowed , and necessary repairs and so on , she got out of practically all the income tax . Can you tie that ? Stein seems to know his job . Grinned when I was surprised and said that was one reason smart people bought low-income real estate . I 'll be damned . " " And that tells us nothing , " said Mendoza rather regretfully , " except that she did n't want to go to jail . Was that smart anyway . At least up to the last little while . I keep thinking of all Carson said , which says to me that Eliza was getting overconfident , not quite as shrewd as she 'd been . " " And I keep thinking , " said Hackett , " of Tabitha Thirkettle . God , what a name . The obvious answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sake  --  " " A little too obvious ? "  | " You just like it complicated . Not that this one is n't complicated enough . " " Tal vez , " said Mendoza . He lit a new cigarette and stared at it . " But  --  " Sergeant Farrell came in and said they had , probably , another suicide . Corpse just found in an alley off First Street . Suicide note in breast pocket . An old man . " Oh , hell , " said Hackett . " More routine . I know , do n't say it , what we 're mostly here to do . Glorified clerks . " He got up . At about the same time the desk clerk at that hotel on Olive Avenue was sitting with his feet propped up on a stool , behind the counter , and trying to lose himself again in the current issue of Startling Detective . Only he could n't quite forget that girl . Hell , it was n't any of his business . If she knew anything about that poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the cops her own self and spill it anyways . Hell of a thing , he thought . First suicide they 'd had since he 'd worked here . Damn pretty little girl , looking happy as could be when she registered . Mary Brown . The other girl not so pretty . Not so young . That cop around asking  --  hell , a plain-clothes man , and he did n't look over twenty-one . ( The clerk did n't know that that fact was the bane of Tom Landers ' life . ) Well , he had n't seen any more in the papers about it ; probably they 'd found out all they wanted and that was that . No business of his  --  just because some dame comes in asking for the suicide  --  He 'd thought honest to God she was going to faint away when he told her . Just said " No ! " and turned white as a sheet . And looked like she was going to faint . And then asking all the questions . The clerk shifted position and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be a good one . He started to read the story , but his mind kept going back to that girl . To both girls . Just walking out like that , fast , when he asked what her name was . And why the hell he 'd done thatThe desk clerk had quit school in the tenth grade , and he did n't especially like hard work ; he 'd drifted around some ; he did n't go to any church since leaving home , and he liked a bet on the ponies now and then , and he 'd been known to take up with a few females with somewhat tarnishedreputations , and occasionally he tied one on , and all in all he was n't exactly the most upright and respectablecitizen in L.A. County . But he 'd been raised in a small town by God-fearing parents , and inevitably some of that had stuck by him : among other things , his father 's emphaticstrictures about cooperating with the **26;7392;TOOLONG . For some thirty minutes , Startling Detective fought a losing battle with what has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of which time the clerk sighed impatiently , reached for the phone book , looked up the number , dialed Headquarters and asked for Homicide . He did n't remember the detective 's name ; he said , " It 's about that Mary Brown . This is  --  " " This is , " said the phone loudly , " Bainbridge , who the hell did you think  --  Listen  --  " " Oh , yes , " said Mendoza . " Are you having fun with all the old and new embalmed corpses ? " " You can go straight to hell , " said Bainbridge . " My good God almighty , landing me with  --  But that 's not what I 'm calling about , damn it . Listen , I told you that book was checked out on my library card ! I told you to be  --  And now I take the damn book back  --  this morning  --  andp196they call me just now and claim it 's been defaced  --  one of the plates torn out  --  and demand four goddamn bucks becausethe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell you highhanded cops think you 're doing , taking  --  " " Oh , really ? " said Mendoza . Hackett was still sitting opposite him . " Just a minute , " he said . " Art , did you lift a plate out of that book on herbs ? " " Lift a  --  Of course not . Why ? Bainbridge said  --  " " Yes . . . We 'll look into it , Doctor . Do n't fuss about the four bucks . I can run to that if  --  " " Fuss ! " said Bainbridge . " Cops ! Why I ever got myself involved with cops  --  "  |p197Landers  was out when the desk clerk 's call came in , but he came into the office about half an hour later and Sergeant Farrell told him about it . Feeling hopeful , Landers went right out again and chased over to the hotel on Olive . Something ? he wondered . You slogged your heart out at the deadly routine , day in and day out , and then by pure chance or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somebody asking for Mary Brown at that hotel . . . " What exactly did she say ? " he asked the desk clerk . " Did she give any name ? " " No , she did n't . I thought about it awhile before callin ' , but I figured I 'd better . I never saw her before . She was maybe twenty-six , twenty-seven , not so pretty as the girlp198killed herself , but nice-enough lookin ' . Dark hair , medium-tall , blue eyes , I guess . . . I do n't remember what she had on . She just asked for this Mary Brown and I said she was n't here and then I asked was she a friend of hers , and I sort of broke it to her what happened and , honest to God , I thought she was going to pass out . She turned white as a sheet and says No ! just like that , and I got up and asked her did she want a glass of water or somethin ' and she said , kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you people 'd done and all and I told her all I knew . And I said , " said the clerk virtuously , " maybe she ought to go see you , but she was on the way out then . She still looked awful  --  like she was going to pass out . . . I got no idea who she was or where she went . I just thought  --  " He said it all over again , but that was it . Landers thanked him for calling in , went out to the sidewalk and stood a minute while he lit a cigarette . That certainly seemed to be that . No way to trace the girl . ButHe 'd listened to Mendoza often enough on his somewhat unorthodox ideas about detection . What it came down to , said Mendoza , was very simple first principles . Like the story about the idiot boy and the lost horse . If you were a horseLanders looked up and down the street , debating . Girl looked ready to pass out , the clerk said . Friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half ago . Still  --  having just heard that her friend was dead , a presumed suicide  --  would she just have got on a bus or walked away somewhere  --  looking ready to pass out ? This was an old part of town along here too , the buildingsshabby . Up from the hotel , which stood alone , was a block of stores running up toward Twenty-First Street : shoe repairs , a hole-in-the-wall jewelry shop , Sam 's Eatery ,  |p199a  dry cleaner 's , a shabby dress shop , and a drugstore on the corner . Landers tried Sam 's Eatery first and drew blank . Nobody remembered such a girl there . Well , he thought philosophically , it was n't a very inviting-looking place and maybe  --  He could always come back to the other places , ask if someone had seen her pass . The idea in his mind  --  He asked at the drugstore and drew blank again . He started back the other way , down toward Twentieth Street . A hand laundry  --  nothing seen of her there ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner a little newsstand with a counter where they also sold cigarettes , cigars , candy , a few sundries . There was a stout , cheerful-looking elderly man behind the counter , and at Landers ' question he looked concerned . " Did n't she get home O.K. ? Who are you ? " Jackpot , thought Landers , and asked more questions . Yes , the old man said , that girl had come walking along about two-thirty this afternoon . Stopped and leaned on the counter , looked like she was about to faint away . " So I quick go out and give her an arm , set her down here on my chair , an ' shove her head down on her knees , and bring her a glass o ' water from the back . And pretty soon she looks some better  --  nice-lookin ' girl , and I got daughters round her age , I was sorry  --  she thanks me , says she just heard some awful bad news , but she never did such a thing as nearly faint in public , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can she call a cab , accountta she do n't feel well enough to go home on a bus , so I say let me look at the stand down the street , and Eddy was there , just pulled in from a run , so I  --  " Jackpot again , thought Landers . Was this thing going to come unstuck all at once ? The cabby was Eddy Dale ; the old fellow knew him . Landers went down to the cabstand ,  |p200found  it empty , used the direct phone to call the company office , identified himself and requested that Eddy Dale be dispatched from wherever he was to answer some questions . And twenty minutes later Eddy Dale turned up in his cab . " Oh , that one , " he said . " Sure I remember , and anyways I got it down on the record . For the comp'ny . I felt kinda sorry for her  --  in the cab she starts cryin ' , quiet-like but all broke up over something  --  and it 's a little trip and comes to quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be ridin ' in cabs  --  " " What was the address ? " asked Landers eagerly . " Martel Street in Hollywood , just north of Fountain  --  it come to six eighty-three , and she was still cryin ' , she give me seven singles and a quarter , but I still felt sorry for her  --  " He looked at the record and added the exact address . Feeling a little excited , Landers sought the nearest publicphone and called the office . " I 've got a witness , I think . Who 's there ? " " Nobody here but George , " said Farrell . " The boss got a call from Bainbridge , and in about five minutes he and Art came tearing out yelling where 's Jase , and about then he walked in , so the boss tells me they 'll all be at that hotel again  --  you know  --  " " Coffin Corner , " said Landers . " Yeah . Well , ask Higgins  --  hell , no sense using two cars , what time is it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  we can take my car . I think we 've got a real ident on Mary Brown . " " Well , well , progress . I 'll tell him . " It was a court , an old one but neat enough and recently painted : a row of three each side , of small stucco duplexp201apartments , cement walk down the middle , neat strips of lawn . Higgins had been congratulatory , and Landers felt smug . Of course they did n't know which of the twelve apartments it was , but that was a small stumbling block ; they found the manageress in one of the front ones and gave her a description . She stared at them , a fat middle-aged woman , at cops on her doorstep , and said , " Why , that sounds like Cecilia Dawson , but why on earth the police  --  well , it 's number four this side , but what on earth  --  " They thanked her and walked down to number four . And after an interval the door was answered by a pretty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been crying , her eyes still looked puffy , and she 'd just washed her face and had n't put any new make-up on ; and she was wearing a neat blue cotton housecoat zipped up the front , and she looked at them dully and said she did n't want to buy anything . Higgins showed her his badge and said , " You were in the Stewart Hotel this afternoon , Miss Dawson , asking for Miss Mary Brown . We 'd like to hear anything you can tell us about Miss Brown . You did know her ? " She stared at them , and then abruptly swung the door wide . " Yes , I knew her , " she said . " Come in . I 'll tell you whatever I can . I 've just been  --  I ca n't take it in . Mary . H-how did she do it ? That clerk just s-said she killed herself , he did n't seem to  --  How 'd you know where I live ? " They went in . It was a small living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything neat and dusted . " Please sit down , " she said . She sat in an armchair beside the couch ; they saw that there was an open Bible on the table between , and a silver rosary . " I 'll tell you anything I can , but the clerk said  --  last Wednesday  --  "  | " Well , we 've had a little trouble finding out who she was , " said Landers . " Was Mary Brown her real name , Miss Dawson ? " " Who she was ? Her  --  well , for heaven 's sake , of course it was ! I do n't  --  And all over that no-good man ! I 'd been worried about it , " said Cecilia Dawson miserably . " BecauseMary did n't have any judgment about people , she was  --  she was just as open and friendly as a  --  as a puppy . Believe anything anybody told her , and I 'd written her  --  " " If we can just have it from the beginning , Miss Dawson , " said Higgins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to quite a lot . Ceciliaand Mary had first met nearly five years back , and even though Cecilia was four years older they 'd taken to each other right away , for one reason because they 'd both been orphans , brought up in orphanages . Cecilia in the Holy Name Home back in Illinois and Mary in a state place here , but  --  They 'd both been working at the same place in Sacramento then , waiting on table at this restaurant . Mary 's first job it was ; she was only seventeen , just out of the home . " And I tried to help her , give her little tips how to get along , and all  --  a nice kid , but she did n't have any caution  --  " And then a year ago Cecilia had come down here ; she 'd been going to night school to learn stenography and thought there 'd be more openings down here , and she 'd got a better job . " But we wrote a lot back and forth , I guess you could say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy but not so  --  not so close like we 'd been , we shared a room for four years  --  " And about six months back Mary had started to write about this fellow . A Harvey Fletcher . " He gave her a big play and she fell for him hard , but she did n't have any sense about men , " said Cecilia wretchedly . " I 've got to try to explain it to you , Mary was a good girlp203you must n't think she was n't , I 'd know that  --  but she wanted to get married and have a family  --  well , most girls do , and I guess any of us raised like that in homes , well , we want it even more , make good homes for our kids , you know . The place she grew up , they did n't seem to teach the kids much religion , and I 'm not one for trying to press my religion on anybody , but Mary was so sort of lost  --  that way  --  we 'd done some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me sometimes . And that 's another thing I just ca n't  --  because we 'd talked about that too , and I rememberher saying she could n't imagine wanting to kill yourself , but  --  " Cecilia groped for her handkerchief . " But she wrote me everything , and some of what she said about this fellow I did n't like the sound of , and I wrote her back and told her to be careful , but about three months ago  --  " She stopped , looking ashamed and embarrassed . " Miss Dawson , " said Higgins , " we know she was preg-nant . " " Oh , it was awful . She wrote me , " whispered Cecilia . " But you must n't think she  --  She was good . She was just such an innocent , even when she 'd worked around a little , like me . She  --  she was the kind that 'd have been just innocentand sweet if she 'd lived to be ninety ! " A sob shook her and she groped for the rosary beside her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get married  --  I 'd believe that when I saw it ! And then she wrote  --  " " Excuse me , this man  --  Fletcher  --  did he work in Sacra-mento ? " Cecilia shook her head , found her handkerchief again and blew her nose . " No , he 's a salesman , he works for SanbornManufacturing , they make a lot of farm equipment and he travels all over the state , Mary said . And he 's older than Mary  --  about thirty-five , she said , which I did n't like the sound of  --  well , you know . And  --  "  |p204Landers  ' pulse jumped a little . A traveling man . " You 're sure of that ? " Cecilia nodded . " And I did n't believe it when she wrote and said they were going to be married . It sounded as if he 'd been stringing her along . And she did n't know his home address , just that he lives in L.A. , she asked me to look in the phone book so she could write him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , this was j-just after Christmas , and I looked , but he is n't listed . I even called the company , but they would n't tell me anything . And so I thought maybe he 'd even given her a wrong name  --  no caution at all , Mary 's so friendly and innocent  --  and then out of the blue I got this letter about ten days ago , and she said they 're going to be married ! He did n't get up to Sacramento until just the day before she wrote me , so she could tell him , and right away he said , Why , sure they 'd be married . And she was so excited and happy about it  --  even if  --  you know  --  the baby 'd come only about five months after  --  And I thought then , well , maybe it was all right and the fellow was all right . Mary so sweet and  --  " " Do you know what the arrangements were ? " asked Landers . She nodded , blowing her nose again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he told her to go to that hotel . And he 'd come pick her up , and they 'd drive over to Vegas that night and be married , so there would n't be a waiting period . Well , she called me on Wednesday afternoon where I work  --  just a couple of minutes , to say she 'd got in . The bus had engine trouble , it was late . And she 'd called him at a number he gave her and he 'd said he 'd come get her that evening . She sounded so happy  --  And naturally I did n't try to contact her afterward because she 'd said they 'd stay over in Vegas the weekend and then come back to that hotel because this Fletcher 'd just had ap205room somewhere here and gave that up and they 'd stay at the hotel until they found a place of their own . So I knew she 'd be back there today , and probably he 'd be at work , and I did want to see her , hear all about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked the boss for an hour off  --  I guess I was still a little worried . And when that clerk s-said  --  1 Just ca n't take it in . Mary . It must be he backed out at the last minute and she just  --  She must have felt so scared and alone , but I can understand it , she knew I 'd have stood by her and helped her through it ! " Cecilia looked at them piteously . " Please , h-how did she d-do it ? She did n't hang  --  " " She 'd taken a lot of sleeping pills , Miss Dawson , " said Landers . " An overdose . Was she in the habit of using them ? You 'd know ? " " Sleeping pills  --  Well , of course not ! Mary ? Of course not  --  How 'd she get them ? " Higgins looked at Landers . " You may have hit a bigger jackpot than you think . " " I thought all along there was something fishy about it , " said Landers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where 's her Social Security card ? She probably had a little savings account too , and  --  Miss Dawson ? " " Do you mean she d-did n't  --  That  --  that man  --  ! Oh ! Oh , you 've got to  --  Oh , Mary darling !  --  " And Cecilia dissolvedinto tears again . A block away from the court Landers slammed on the brakes and swerved into a section of red-painted curb . " Suddenly occurs to me , if we get on this fast  --  It 's a quarterof six . Time to get hold of some information where he works , if we 're lucky . " He dived into the drugstore on the corner , scrabbling for change in his pocket , and leafed over the phone book ,  |p206found  Sanborn Manufacturing out in Whittier . It was evidently a big outfit , and he got shunted around some even in the personnel office , but finally at just on six o'clock he got hold of a Mr. Forester , who was cooperative . Puzzled , but cooperative . When he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , " You feel like doing a little overtime on this ? " " After hearing about Mary , I guess I do , " said Higgins . " What did you get on Fletcher ? " " The rest of the story , probably , " said Landers , shoving the " drive " button and glancing over his shoulder at the oncoming traffic . " The old sad story , but then there 's nothingnew about human nature either . Fletcher 's worked for them for thirteen years  --  clean record with the company . Makes a good salary , call it twelve , thirteen thousand a year . He 's married , has two kids , ten and seven . " " Oh , yes , " said Higgins . " So he goes around playing on the side , only this girl knows his right name and where he works  --  probably different from the usual girls he played with , according to Cecilia  --  and he 's afraid she 'll come and make a stink around his nice clean record . And with his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming down here  --  " " It 's easy to read , " said Landers wryly . " But not much evidence . She did n't have access to sleeping pills , we can probably show that . Does his wife take them maybe ? Or does he ? Lab can tell us the brand or maker . But all her identification taken  --  that 's clear , he could figure , such an ordinary name , we 'd never trace her back . Figured maybe we would n't try very hard  --  obvious suicide . " " He does n't know us , " said Higgins . " No . He gives her a number to call  --  Cecilia said that  --  let him know her room number . Comes up with a bottle of wine or something , must celebrate their elopement over top207Vegas , and she 's all starry-eyed  --  dear Harvey making an honest woman of her  --  " " And then when she passes out he undresses her , washes out the glass with the traces of wine or whatever , dissolves a little more sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the glass , takes the second glass away with him  --  or maybe , all romantic , they were just using one . Not too bad an effort , Tom . Quite slick , in fact . And we can say that , but how about pinning it on him ? " " Why and how did he take her identification , " said Landers , " if she was alive and well when he left ? How 'll he explain that ? " " He 'll say he never was there . Called her on the phone  --  or  --  no  --  he told her when she called him there was nothing doing , after all . So she  --  " " And all the coming and going in that hotel  --  but we might get a break , somebody might remember seeing him . And I kind of think , " said Landers in grim satisfaction , " that Miss Cecilia Dawson is going to be our Harvey 's nemesis . And Mary 's letters , which she 'd kept . " He patted his pocket ; Cecilia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long letters . " Suddenly he laughed withoutmuch humor . " Harvey did n't know about Cecilia , the bosom friend right in his own home town , and we can guess why . Little Mary , faithfully believing in the old advice to the lovelorn  --  listen to the boy friend , do n't monopolize the conversation  --  so Harvey never heard about best-friend Cecilia . " Higgins smiled . " Could be . So we 're heading ? " " For Harvey . He 's at home now  --  not on the road , that is . South Pasadena . " Even in the absence of the McLaughlins , the Celtic Hotelseemed to generate crises . Mendoza , Hackett and Gracep208had walked into the middle of one . Evidently Mrs. Binny had come right down like a conscientious relative , unlikablethough the task was , to take her sister away . Well , the afternoon editions had had some headlines about the McLaughlinsand the bodies in the attic , which she 'd probablyseen after Mendoza and Grace had seen her . And Miss Manning was being obdurate . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , with Mrs. Rialto vainly trying to act as peacemaker . " I 'm quite comfortable here now , Eve . " " But it 's impossible , you ca n't stay here alone  --  this place  --  do n't be silly , Vera , you 're coming with me at  --  " " Now , my dears , let 's all be sensible and discuss it quietly- " Matters were not helped toward sensible discussion by the invisible presence of Mrs. Lightfoot upstairs , who suddenlyand cacophonically burst into hideous song , unfortunatelyall too audible : " Away , awa-hay ! My heart 's on fi-hire ; I burn this ba-hase decep-shun to repay ! This very ni-hight my vengeance di-i-i-ire Shall guh-lut itself in GORE  --  " " Er  --  Mrs. Rialto , " said Mendoza . She cast him a helplessly humorous glance and betook herself upstairs . Presently the cacophony died an abrupt death . But for a while they did n't get anywhere . " You took a photograph out of that book , Miss Manning . Did  --  " " Book ? I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was demure , adjusting her scarves . " All you tiresome peopleinterrupting my letter writing . " " Listen , Miss Manning . Both Sergeant Higgins and De/tective Grace can swear that there were only the three of you in Henry 's room when the book was laid on that table . I doubt very much whether either Oscar or Henry tamperedwith it . You wanted the picture of the foxglove plant , to be able to identify it . Was n't that it ? " She 'd been in the lobby when Grace had gone back for the book , but she 'd had plenty of opportunity to extract the plate , Grace had said  --  Oscar and Henry arguing , taking no notice . " You 'd heard me say what poison Eliza had had , and so  --  " " For goodness ' sake ! " said Mrs. Binny faintly . " You are n't saying  --  she 's poisoned somebody ? She 's never been  --  Vera ? Oh , no , it is n't  --  " " It 's so important , " murmured Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the front . Somewhere in France . They do so look forward to letters from home . " " Miss Manning , if you  --  " " We 've still got a search warrant , Lieutenant , " said Grace mildly . And so they had . And the very hell of it was , reflected Mendoza , if this hunch was so  --  and when he considered it , he really could n't see Oscar or Henry planning to slip Jane the poison ( however unlethal ) on the same night they had a good many hours ' work ahead of them getting all the coffinsback home in their peaceful little fourth-floor mausoleum  --  thehell of it was that this said something rather discouraging . It said that Vera Manning , if she 'd been the one to slip the oleander concoction into Jane 's tea , had most definitely not been the X who had somehow induced Eliza McCann to swallow the very-much-lethal foxglove concentrate . For if she had , she 'd scarcely have had any need for the photograph of the foxglove , to hunt more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mendoza nodded at Grace and Hackett , who departed to search herp210room . " Really , Eve , why you have to come bothering me now  --  I expect Oscar or someone will be home soon , and  --  " " Really , my dear Vera , I am responsible and you  --  " Presently Grace and Hackett came back with the photographlifted out of the book Dr. Bainbridge had got at the library . Untidily torn out . Probably in her large buckled bag when they had searched the place on Sunday . . . Come to remember , she 'd been out somewhere then . Mrs. Binny said , " Oh , my God . You do n't mean  --  " " So what about it , Miss Manning ? " said Mendoza . She gave him an unexpectedly shrewd look ; she giggled again and smoothed her scarves with a long-clawed , veined old hand . " Someone giving Ellie poison , " she said . " Very queer . I ca n't think who would want to do that . She was patient with me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but I tried . And you did say  --  well , Jane was so tiresome . Especiallyafter Ellie was gone . Always interrupting me . And I just thought how much more restful if she was n't there . To interrupt me . " She looked at Mendoza with uncanny directness . " I do n't suppose , if I tell you , Eve could take me away somewhere ? You 'd take me somewhere else . You think I 'm crazy . But I suppose they 'd be kind . Wherever . And everyone 's gone away here . Even Gertrude . " Suddenly she looked bewildered and lost . " And Eve is n't really kind , you know . She thinks I 'm crazy too . Perhaps I am  --  I do n't really know . It seems such a long time I 've had to wait for Albert . To have our own little home and  --  and babies of our own . " " Miss Manning  --  " She should have been a ludicrous , nearly obscene figure there , the old scrawny hennaed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " My God ! " said Mrs. Binny in a thin scream . " No  --  the disgrace  --  the newspapers  --  " " And Ellie 's gone , she always told me what to do . But1 Jane was so tiresome , always calling for something , and I just thought  --  But I could n't find any . Anything that looked like the picture . So I looked in Ellie 's room  --  that was on Sunday , I think  --  she had a lot of books  --  no , it was Saturday night  --  " No seal on that door , of course. "  --  and I found one about gardening , and it said that oleander is poisonous , and I did know that when I saw it  --  such pretty flowers , you know . " " Where did you get it , Miss Manning ? " asked Mendoza . Her pale eyes moved to him . " Oh , that nice park . About the only place nearby . Mr. Caradoccio has an oleander bush in his back yard  --  a nice man  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queer if he saw me  --  And I 'm quite accustomed to walking , of course . As Ellie did . Miles , sometimes . But that nice park 's only about sixteen blocks awayMy God . Elysian Park , of course . Where the Police Academywas . " Vera ! " Mrs. Binny leaned against the wall and shut her eyes . Miss Manning looked around the empty , bare , dusty lobby . Suddenly she shivered a little . " Everything 's changed here . Since Ellie 's gone . Has n't it ? I 'll have to go somewhere else . But not where Eve wants to send me . She 's not kind . And I do n't feel as if I 'm crazy , the way Eve says , but it 's been such a long time to wait for Albert , and I 'm tired . " Her gaze came back to Mendoza . " They 're all gone . Jane too . She was so annoying , but I suppose I should n't have poisoned her . Only I 'm very tired now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " to be kind of decimatingthe population of this hotel . " He looked at its dark ramshackle bulk looming over them . Mendoza said he had noticed it . There had , of course , been quite a little scene , what with Mrs. Binny moaning about the disgrace and Miss Manning suddenly agitated to hysterics at being expected to leave without every last piece of her belongings  --  they had n't a warrant , of course  --  and Mrs. Rialto had been invaluable , soothing her down , offering to help pack a case : " They 'll send all the rest of your things on , I 'll see to it personally , dear Miss Man-ning . " " But all my stationery  --  my pen  --  my  --  where are they taking me ? "  | " Now , dear , just a few minutes ago you were quite ready to go with the nice policemen  --  " They sent for a squad car and a couple of policewomen in the end , and Mrs. Binny , apparently washing her hands of the whole situation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . Mendoza and Grace were awaiting the policewomen ; Hackett was keeping an eye on the bagpacking . Mendoza flicked ash from his cigarette , looking after the Buick . " So , a little money , " he said . " She 's been getting by very cheap on dear Vera all these years . Camarillo'llcome down on her for a bit more . " " I expect , " agreed Grace , " that 's where Vera 'll end up all right . " " Stash her in the psychiatric ward of the General tonight , ship her up there for examination tomorrow . Have to be an indictment and a hearing , but that 's where she 'll spend the rest of her days , probably . And probably settle down happily enough , as long as they let her go on writing letters to Albert . But you know , Jase  --  " " Oh , yes , I had seen that too , " said Grace . " She was n't the one who got the poison into Eliza . Not when she wanted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mind . This is a kind of confused case , is n't it ? " " Understatement . The damnedest thing I 've come across  --  or almost  --  since I 've been in Homicide , " said Mendoza . The policewomen arrived . The squad car arrived with two men . Among them they got Miss Manning , with her little bag , soothed down and into the squad car . Mrs. Rialtowas going along . " Just to see her safely tucked in , " she said to Mendoza breezily . " Poor thing . Dear me , who would have dreamed all this would happen ? These coffins . Well , one never does know about people , does one ? Oh , I ca n't say it really troubles me  --  the idea of it  --  but thenp214I 'm not at all superstitious . And , after all , they 're gone now . " " You 'll all have to leave now , " said Mendoza , regarding her a little curiously . " Oh , I do n't know . It 's been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these little people . Dear Mrs. Lightfoot , living on such a pittance  --  and poor dear Bobby  --  and Percy , of course , though he 's only here to sleep . And little Myra . Where should we all go , to live as cheaply ? I could manage the place for Oscar , you know . I 've been thinking I should go to see him and offer the proposition . Collect the rents for him . Well , we shall see . But this poor creature  --  I must reassure her as best as I can until she 's  --  " She gave Mendoza a cheery smile and popped her plump personinto the squad car beside Miss Manning and one of the policewomen . " Now , dear , you just relax and let us take care of you  --  " " I 'd rather go with you than Eve , Myra . " " That 's right , dear . " The door slammed and the squad car took off . " Well , just fancy that , " murmured Grace . " Collection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bet attractingmore of the same kind ? I do n't suppose Oscar and Henry 'll draw much , it 's only a misdemeanor , funnily enough . " " Six to nine months , I 'd guess , " said Hackett , coming up . " And I also guess we do n't get dinner for a while . " There was , of course , a lot of paper work to do and routineto get busy at . They put in a request for a warrant and typed up the reports for the justice to sign . By that time Sergeant Farrell had gone home and SergeantThorns had taken his place and Galeano and Schenke , the night-duty men , had come in . At ten minutes past seven Mendoza was just walking out of the office , leav/ing the last of the reports to Hackett  --  Grace had already gone home  --  when Landers and Higgins came in with a man between them . He was a medium-sized , good-looking man about thirty-five , well dressed , and he looked very nervous and frightened . " Something ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Higgins take the man into an interrogation room and told Mendoza all about Harvey Fletcher . " I think we 've figured it out pretty well . It was murder , all right  --  put it all together . For one thing , why bring her down here just to tell her it was no go ? And I do n't think we 'll have to lean on him much , the way he 's reacted . We walked in just as they were sitting down to dinner . " Landers grimaced . " Pretty wife , two nice kids . They were just bewildered . His record says good husband and father . But he never thought anybody could connect him to Mary Brown , and now that we have he can probably see for himself we can connect him up tight . " " Yes , and you know , " said Mendoza , " that was a slick little job , Tom . Near as nothing we put it down as suicide . It makes me wonder if it 's the first time Mr. Fletcher 's stepped off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't got that far . Could be , I suppose -- somewhere , " said Landers , " where they do n't keep quite such smart bloodhounds . " And he smiled . Mendoza stayed to sit in on the questioning of Fletcher  --  who just shook his head when punctiliously told he could have an attorney present . For a little while Fletcher attempted to bluster : never knew the girl , did n't know anything about all this , ask his company what a good record he had , ask his wife , and so on . " And how many pretty girls along your sales route , Mr. Fletcher ? " asked Higgins . " Did you ever get a girl in trouble before , Mr. Fletcher ? " asked Landers.  | " When did you decide to get rid of Mary permanently , Mr. Fletcher ? " " Where 'd you get the sleeping pills ? Were they your wife 's ? Your own ? " " You 've got this all wrong ! I never knew  --  I do n't know anything  --  " " Mr. Fletcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it , but Mary had a girl friend down here . A Miss Cecilia Dawson . And Mary wrote her all about everything , Mr. Fletcher . What you promised her about going over to Vegas and so on . About coming down here and going to that hotel . You know that hotel , do n't you , Mr. Fletcher ? You know a lot of other traveling men , and know that there 's always coming and going in that hotel , and at least two public entrances . Pick the nice quiet time , say after nine in the evening , you could slip in there without anybodynoticing you  --  which is just what you did . Why should you lure Mary all the way down here just to tell her you were going to back out of the deal ? Just , even , to explain that you already had a wife and family , could n't marry her ? You could have told her that in Sacramento , Mr. Fletcher . You had a reason for it . Why did you take away all her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least . " " You had a dandy reason , Mr. Fletcher . We 've got all Mary 's letters to Cecilia , from about six months ago  --  all she wrote about you . It was just your little mistake to get mixed up with a nice girl for a change . A girl like Mary  --  who could n't be bought off . She could have made trouble for you , ruined that nice clean reputation you 've got  --  at home . Blackmail would n't have occurred to her , but she could have gone to your company , to your wife  --  a nicep217honest girl , Mary . An innocent . So you had to get rid of her permanently . " " I  --  look , I do n't know  --  " But Fletcher was curiously gray . He seemed to decrease in size as they watched him , as if he was shrinking inside his clothes . It was an effect the older of them had seen before : the confident , successful man , with the good life made , suddenly caught up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he was starting to . He blinked up at Landers , and there was a funny little sick smile on his mouth , and he said , " Letters  --  " " You 're tied in but very tight , Mr. Fletcher , " said Higgins . " What 'd you take up to her room to celebrate your elopement with ? Champagne ? " " Where 'd you get the sleeping pills ? " " Tell your wife you were going out on business that night  --  last Wednesday night ? " " What did you do with her identification ? Such a commonname  --  you did n't think we 'd ever trace her back . We had a fluke piece of luck there , but in time we would have , you know . " " How long did she take to pass out , Mr. Fletcher ? Innocent , friendly little Mary who loved you and wanted a home and a family . " Fletcher looked up at them all and wet his lips . No light glaring in his face , not a finger laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . He shook his head dumbly . It was n't happening to him . Good citizen Fletcher , on the surface  --  good job , nice house and family , successful man . Like most of that kind , he did n't know much about cops , had n't had much contact with cops . He looked at them standing around him in a loose circle  --  the roughhewn , hefty Higgins , the only one you might pick out at a glance as a cop ; Mendoza , dapper , slender , mus/tached , cold-eyed ; youthful Landers with his open boyish face and slim gangling height ; stocky , dark Galeano , blue-chinned ; sandy little Schenke , who 'd just slipped in at five-nine  --  and he just shook his head . He 'd got in a bind , after the years of his furtive playing around away from home ; and in a little panic at the threat of being exposed , of losing all of what , probably , he genuinely valued , he 'd done a sly sneaking little crime , and thus inevitably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you kiss her before you spiked the drink , Mr. Fletcher ? She 'd have been happy to see you  --  called you darling , did n't she ? Where 'd you get the pills , Mr. Fletcher ? Did  --  " " Stop it , " he said . " Stop it . " There was nothing in his voice ; his voice was dead . " I had an old prescription . It was ordinary stuff . A lot of it around . Yes , she called me darling . She was happy . She did n't even know what was happening . But I knew . She just said she felt  --  sleepyandshe 'd sleep in the car  --  going over to Vegas  --  because she wanted to be awake for her own wedding . I never thought there 'd be anything  --  anything at all  --  to connectto me . How could there be ? How many Mary Browns are there ? I  --  " " Do you want to make a statement , Mr. Fletcher ? You have the right to have an attorney present before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mendoza formally . Fletcher did n't seem to hear him . " How should I know about this  --  this other girl ? Mary never mentioned her . Women . Women , " he said tiredly . " Innocent , all right . I should have steered clear of that . One like that . For God 's sake . Me . I did n't see any way anybody could ever con-nect  --  " " Mr. Fletcher . Do you want to call an attorney ? " All thep219new laws , the damned laws hamstringing them at every turn : a signed confession would n't be usable unless Fletcher'slawyer was there at the time . " I did n't know  --  how could I know ? Women , " said Fletcher . He sounded very tired . All of a sudden he looked ten years older . Harvey Fletcher would n't , reflected Mendoza , have to do any more worrying about women from here on in . With persuasion he gave them a lawyer 's name . They called him . Mendoza , Higgins and Hackett went home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and Landers . They 'd have a busy time , listening to the confession , possibly arguing with the lawyer , getting the confession typed and signed and witnessed . At least that was one tied up and in the bag . Over a belated dinner Mendoza told Alison about it . " And I could n't count how many times I 've met Fletcher before . And Mary . What the hell am I doing down there dealing with all the dirt and violence and evil ? " Alison surveyed him benignly , and when she 'd married Luis Rodolfo Vicente Mendoza a little over three years ago she 'd thought she knew him pretty well , but she knew him even better now , and she said , " I only know what John Lockhart says , sheep dog with the built-in herding instinct . Any good cop . You would n't know what to do with yourself . ; For supuesto que no ! " " Por de pronto , " said Mendoza , holding out his cup for more coffee , " we 're still stymied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He brought her up to date on that . " You can see , obvio , it was n't Manning who accounted for Eliza . But who did , and how , and why ? " " Mmh , " said Alison . " Where 'd she find the oleander  --  Manning ? " Mendoza looked annoyed . " Up in Elysian Park . Where  --  " He grunted and swore as Sheba landed on his shoulder without warning . " She did it to the Helms Bakery driver this morning . He dropped two loaves of bread and a box of coffeecake and said she was a public menace , " said Alison . " Where the Police Academy is . Yes . About the only area where there 's much greenery down there . Had you thought , Luis , that maybe the foxglove came from there too ? " Mendoza looked at her . Sheba walked down him , stepped onto the table and stuck her black nose into the cream pitcher . After finding it empty , she uttered a low curse and investigated the sugar bowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be horrified , I suppose . Unhygienic . I just thought , you know  --  " " ; Bastante ! " said Mendoza . " So do I , belatedly . It just could be . Send somebody to poke around and see if there is any growing there . But it does n't tell us who . Or why . Or how . " " It was just a thought , " said Alison . At nine o'clock on Tuesday morning Sergeant Farrell thrust his head in the door of the sergeants ' room and said somebody wanted to talk to Higgins . Higgins picked up the outside phone , still reading over the confession they 'd got out of Fletcher last night , and said , " Sergeant Hig-gins . " " Oh , Sergeant , this is Clark . Alfred Clark . About the Ycampbusiness . Look , I saw Bud Wilson last night , and I told him what you said , and we talked it over . We do have a program to get kids to camp at a fairly low rate , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widow could afford twenty a week ? " " Well , I do n't know , " said Higgins doubtfully . " That's  --  I do appreciate your trying to help me out , Mr. Clark . But  --  " " Not at all . Well , I suppose you could tell her it was less . If you  --  " Higgins liked Mr. Alfred Clark because he did n't sound amused . He recognized it as a real problem . " Yes , if she did n't investigate herself , " he said thoughtfully . " But , look , Mr. Clark . I could tell her I 'd run into this Mr. Wilsoncasually . He 'd be the man she 'd see about it ? He 's attached to the Hollywood Y , you said ? And if she did , he could tell her  --  say about a special rate for fatherless boys ? That sounds sort of reasonable , I mean I know the Y does a lot of good work with  --  " " Sure , " said Clark . " I 'll give you his number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd go for ten bucks a week  --  about as low as would sound plausible , " said Higgins . " And , of course , it 'll be a while yet , we can encourage him to save up his own money for it too . He cuts the neighbors ' lawns for them . " " We 've got a very nice place over on Catalina Island . Transportation included . The boys have to furnish their own bedding and specified clothing  --  sneakers and jeans and a certain number of shirts and so on  --  and there 's a dollar laundry charge . Open July first through August twentieth . " " Well , I think that 'd be fine , " said Higgins . " Let me have Wilson 's number . . . Thanks . I do appreciate this , Mr. Clark . " " Not at all , " said Clark in a friendly tone . " Good Samaritan , you . " " That 's me , " said Higgins . " Thanks a lot . " He put the phone down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen to him . Plodding bachelor George Higgins , doing O.K. with the females now and then , and also interested in the kids , with the Big Brother clubs and so on . Mary Dwyer . And Bert 's kids . But mostly Mary , and an independent woman she certainly was , and if she ever found out  --  ! Well , anyway , he 'd talk to Wilson . Get Stevie to summer camp . Tell Mary , all casual , he 'd just happened to run into this fellow and they 'd got talking and he 'd heard about the special rate for fatherless boys andHe just hoped it would work . After the piano-teacher bit  --  so dangerously similar . But a detective did run into all sorts of people in the daily routine , after all . He sighed again and went back to the paper work on Fletcher . They had by then checked out , through the D.M.V. , some forty plate numbers , which Higgins and Glasser had dreamed up , that might have been hastily misread JGN-790 . Hunting ( needle in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had killed Patrolman Harry Cohen at Seventh and Broadway last Wednesday . All those cars , located , had been checked on : none of them could have been the one driven by the hit-run driver . The D.M.V. was now checking out some twenty more plate numbers , but the chances were looking slim . The wild idea that it had been a deliberate kill looked very unlikely too ; they had looked at Patrolman Harry Cohen and his record , and there just was n't anything to suggest that . Quiet family man : forty-nine , been on the force twenty-three years , one married son , one married daughter . Took a drink occasionally but usually at home , usually only one . Happily married . Attended Temple Zion regularly . Not an ambitious man  --  never got beyondp223patrolman  --  but a good man , a reliable man . Seldom off sick . And in the couple of weeks preceding his death he had n't been known to have had any disagreements with anybody , any quarrels , any trouble . Wife all broken up . Son and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea was wild , all right . A hit-run car  --  driver drunk or hopped up or just a careless , bad driver  --  out of control ; it might look deliberate . In that fairly narrow street . That was all . But the D.M.V. was still checking . Something might turn up . Higgins was looking over what the D.M.V. had sent in most recently when Detective Grace wandered in about ten o'clock , sat down at the next desk and lit a cigarette . " At least , " he said , " I 've got Virginia 's birthday present . Nice ? " He took a little box out of a paper bag , opened it and showed it to Higgins . It was a lapel watch , a stylized gold cat with its tail arched and wound neatly round a small gold watch . " She likes cats . Think she 'll like it . " Nice , " said Higgins , and thought about his modest bank account and how he 'd like to buy presents for Mary . " She 'll like it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Grace , putting the watch away in its box . " That crazy McCann thing . I 've been back asking questions around the store . It adds up to nothing . Nobody knew much about her  --  even the oldest tenants . She had told a couple more of them she was going to raise the rent in April  --  people living in the apartments upstairs , and the druggist at the corner . But  --  " Sergeant Farrell looked in . " Call in from the sheriff 's boys , George . " " Oh , " said Higgins , and picked up the outside phone . " Sergeant Higgins . "  | " Deputy Webster speaking , " said a crisp no-nonsense voice . " We 're holding a man here  --  one Carlos Garcia  --  sheriff 's station in West Hollywood . Picked up at four A.M. , with two other men , attempting to break in private propertyon the Strip . " That was county territory and under the sheriff 's jurisdiction . " Garcia has volunteered some information you might be interested in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed down-town . " " Oh , yes ? " said Higgins . " What does he say ? Any definite  --  " " He says he knows who did it , " said the deputy . " One Pedro Hernandez . An erstwhile pal of his , only they had a little argument over a game of Spanish monte and Garcia'sfeeling mean about getting picked up . " The deputy 's tone was dry . " They will do it , " said Higgins . " Interesting . " He scribblednotes . " Thanks very much . You got an address ? " " He says you 'll find him in your records . Armed assault and rape . Hernandez is n't long out of Chino . And he says , " said the deputy even more dryly , " Hernandez planned on doing it . Getting that patrolman of yours . He told Garcia he was going to do it . Going to get the sonovabitch . He 's got an old car about ready to be junked . " " For God 's sake , " said Higgins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " For a reason , " said Deputy Webster . He sounded a littletired . " Your patrolman down there had given him a couple of tickets just in the last week or so . Speeding and an illegal left turn . Just coincidence it was the same patrolman , but evidently Hernandez did n't think so . Garcia was with him one of the times . " " For God 's sake ! " said Higgins.  |p225The  sheriff 's deputy brought Garcia down while Higgins and Grace went out to Hernandez ' address on Kohler to see if he was home . He was : he had a hang-over and was feeling mean , but even one like Hernandez knew better than to tangle with Higgins , and he just turned sullen . They brought him back to Headquarters after he told them , with persuasion , where to find the car . Which , it turned out , they 'd have caught up to eventually : its plate number was ION-77o , which was one of those Higgins had sent to the D.M.V. as a possible ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was registered to Rafael Hernandez , who turned out to be Pedro 's uncle  --  who also had a pedigree . They questioned Garcia and Hernandez separately ,  |p226with  the sheriff 's man looking on . They got a statement from Garcia right away ; how he 'd heard Hernandez saying he was " going to get that cop " and boasting about it afterward . He 'd been with Hernandez in the car when Cohen gave him the illegal-turn ticket . So they went to work on Hernandez , and it was uphill work . He was the typical punk  --  the smart-aleck answers , the childish sullen evasions  --  thekind any cop 's fist ached for ; but you could n't do things that way , great as the temptation was . This worthless punk , no good to anybody including himself , still had the rights as a citizen . It was a little exercise in futility , because  --  they hoped  --  the lab would come up with something on the car . Especiallysince they did get it out of Hernandez that the car had n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his uncle had had any spare money for gas . " Come on , punk , " prodded Higgins , " you know we 've got you dead to rights . You drove that car that killed Cohen . There 'll be traces on it . You might as well  --  " " Ah , go t ' hell , " said Hernandez . " Where were you last Wednesday morning at eleven o'clock , Pedro ? " asked Hackett . " No business o ' yours . Where were you , bloodhound ? " " Hornbrate ! " said Mendoza coldly . " Have you ever heard the old proverb , punk  --  ? Palabra suelta no tiene vuelta ? Careless talk you ca n't take back . You said this and that to your pal Carlos Garcia . " Hernandez told them what Garcia was . The car had been towed into the garage , and the lab boys had got busy with it right away . It was lucky the Hernandezes had been using their money for vino instead of gas ; the lab boys picked up some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tire and a tiny bit ofp227brain tissue from the bottom of the radiator pan . They sent an informal report up about noon , and Mendoza showed it to Hernandez . " Have you got the brains to understand that , Pedro ? They 'll type the blood and it 'll match Cohen 's . " " Go t ' hell , " said Hernandez sullenly . And God knew they 'd all met the Hernandezes before : there were too many of them around in any big city , wearing a lot of different names and faces , but once in a while it was brought home , even to the old-pro cops , just how dirty the dirt at the bottom of things was . Patrolman Harry Cohen , the good reliable man , just because he 'd written a couple of traffic tickets for the punk . The no-good punk who could n't think five minutes ahead , who was n't remotelycapable of any empathic feeling for any other humanbeing  --  or he would n't be a punk . " All right , up , " said Hackett . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hah ? We 'll see you later , Pedro . " " You can ' hold me ! I done nothin '  --  goddamn cops  --  " " We can hold you until the warrant comes through , " said Hackett , " to make it nice and legal . " They watched Landers tow him out . " That kind , " said Higgins , unconsciously balling his fists . " That kind . God . " " Lo que no se puede remediar , se ha de aguantar , " said Mendoza . " What ca n't be cured . " He looked at his watch . " Let 's go have lunch . " But he was silent on the way out of the room . Farrell caught them at the door and said Glasserhad just finished the paper work on that latest suicide when a new call had come in : old woman found apparently beaten to death in an apartment over on Alpine . Her niece had walked in and found her . Glasser and Piggott had gone out on it . Probably another break-in : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Mendoza . " Another one . All right , Rory , I 'll see them when they come in . " He took his hat off the rack and looked at it pensively . " Jungle gets a little more dangerousevery day . And the damn laws blunting the edges of our machetes . . . I might even buy us all drinks to celebrate picking up Pedro . " But his smile was wry . And , settled at a table at Federico 's , the four of them , Grace said to the waiter , " You tell Joe to mix me a Gloom Chaser . Appropriate . Any of you like to try one with me ? " " What 's in it ? " asked Hackett apprehensively . " Grand Marnier , curacao , lemon juice and grenadine . " " No , thanks , " said Hackett . " Fattening , for one thing . I was up two pounds this morning . Scotch and water . " Higgins ordered absently . " But what the hell is the answer ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are poor , live in what we call slums  --  and it 's all damn relative , most people down here are living a hell of a lot better than the average Czech or Pole or  --  they are n't criminals . Majority of them law-abiding citizens . Hell , Luis , you grew up down here . But the punks  --  the damn smartaleck , worthless punks  --  " " There was a time , " said Grace thoughtfully , " when I did believe , all idealistic , that the answer was education . But after I got past my twenty-first birthday  --  I was in collegethen  --  it sort of came to me that some people you just ca n't educate . The ones without many brains . " " But then there 's Bobby , " said Mendoza . " The news-boy . " " Oh , yes , " said Grace , " that does enter in too , does n't it ? Maybe brains have n't really got much to do with the whole thing . Maybe you can have the highest I.Q. there could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs  --  if you do n't have what they call empathy for **25;7420;TOOLONG . He went across to the window and cleaned a section of it and looked out . The groups of people were still in the piazza . He could see across the piazza and down toward Old Town , toward which all the people were looking , even though he was forced to look over Rosa Bombolini 's broad shoulder . He could see nothing at first , but finally his eyes were able to pick out the movement and he felt his heart jump . He could feel his heart at that moment actually rise in his chest and touch something in his throat , as if he had a live fish in his chest . " Oh , Mother of God , " Fabio said . He made the sign of the cross . " What is your father doing up there ? " Two thirds of the way up the water tower , still at least one hundred feet below the concrete tank and the safety of the little iron railing that runs around it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky and the mountains beyond Santa Vittoria , grippingthe little thin , narrow , rusty ladder that climbs up to the tank itself , clung Italo Bombolini . " What is your father doing up there ? " As soon as he said this for a second time Fabio knew two things : that someone was going to have to help Italo Bombolini and that it was going to be himself . " Why does it have to be me ? " Fabio said aloud . He was astonished and ashamed that he had said it aloud . He turned away from Angela then . The figure was moving once more , moving with a terrible slowness upward . " He 's going to be all right . I 've climbed mountains . I know how people climb . He knows his way around up there . " She began to cry again . Fabio went outside and tapped Rosa Bombolini on the shoulder . " Do you have a length of rope ? A good strong one ? " " Oh , no , " Rosa Bombolini said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride . He 's going to fall . Let him fall . " " He 's still going up . " " Because the son of a bitch ca n't come down , " she said , and Fabio turned red again . He had never heard a woman talk about her husband or a man in this fashion before . " He 's going to come down in that piazza like an ox falling off a roof . "  --  o " I 'm going whether you get me the rope or not , " Fabio said . In the end she got him a rope . She got him two good lengths of rope and she also came back with a basket containing cheese and some olives and two bottles of wine and a fiasco of grappa , the strong raw brandy the peasants distill here . " I ca n't carry all of this , " Fabio said . " Angela will meet you in the Corso with a knapsack , " Signora Bombolini said . Angela passed them then , still crying , and because she was running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite the fact that it was a matter of life and death , all that Fabio could seem to keep his mind on was the quality and conditionof her legs , that they were so strong and well-shaped and so brown and clean-looking . " Why are you so red ? " Rosa Bombolini asked him . " Are you sure you are all right ? " I am very much all right , Fabio thought . I am about to save the father of the woman I love , and she will be grateful to me for the rest of my life . he broke into a trot , although he knew he should save his energy . He met Angela Bombolini at the curve in the Corso Mussolini down below Babbaluche 's house . " Let him fall off , " the cobbler told him . " It would be a public service to the city . " Angela handed him a black knapsack made of imitation leather that had once been the property of the Young Fascist Scouts , and the outer flap of which read : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death " On the other side , burned into the leather , was : " Believe Obey Fight  --  Your Duce . " It caused both of them to laugh . " I 'll pray for you , Fabio , " she said . It was the first time he had ever heard her use his name . The ladder shocked Fabio . He had not looked at it in many years , and he was frightened to see how narrow and inadequate it was . It was not a ladder at all , but long lengths of pipe , five or six inches around , which were joined together and into which small round iron spikes had been fixed , at intervals of six or eight inches , to serve as foot and hand holds . " Do n't look up , Fabio . Just go up , " someone said to him . " Do n't go up . You ca n't help him . " 41He tightened his belt so his shirt would stay in and slung the ropes around his shoulders and tied the bottoms of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't flap . " You 're a fool to go , Fabio . Why should you get killed for him ? " Fabio pulled himself up onto the pipe and for one moment he was forced to look up , and he was astonished to see how far up the fat wine seller had managed to pull himself . The metal was hot to the touch but not hot enough to burn and he took a deep breath then and began to climb . It was not hard for him at first , but he was surprised how narrow the little spikes were ; they felt even smaller than they looked . Something wet touched his hair and he realized it was paint from the buckets Bombolini had yoked about his neck . He tried to look neither up nor down , but out across the mountain slope , the green terraces down below , across the valley ; he fixed his eye on Montefalconc . All at once there was a tremendous shout from the people in the piazza below . He pulled himself in against the pipe and waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When nothing happened he looked up and he could see Angela'sfather hanging out away from the pipe like a door that the wind has blown open . Bombolini had missed his footing ; but somehow , instead of falling , he had managed to hang on with one foot and one hand and now he hung there , swaying back and forth , trying to pull himself back to the pipe . Fabio could feel the pipe trembling from the effort and it frightened him , and then he heard a second cheer from the piazza and he looked up and Bomboliniwas climbing upward again. * * *Across the piazza from the wineshop , in the cellar of the Leaders ' Mansion where The Band had barricaded themselves , they heard the shout . " It wo n't be much longer now , " Dr. Bara said . " They 're getting the feel of it . The mob is feeling its muscle . It 's only a matter of time now . " All of them were there , Copa and Mazzola , Dr. Bara , Vittorini the mail clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes sealed , his teeth broken , his lips split . " Maybe they wo n't come , " Mazzola said . " Maybe they 're cheeringsomething else . " " They wo n't hurt us , " the wife of Francucci said . " We 've alreadypaid the price . " " What , for twenty years of rotten bread ? " the doctor said . " You have only paid the first installment . " " If we knew who was leading them we might be able to figure out something , " Copa , the mayor , said . " Every man has his price , " Mazzola said . " Where the hell is Pelo ? " Copa asked . " I 'll break that bastard 's neck . " They had sent Romano Pelo , the least offensive of men , a shadow of a human being , to go into the town and find out what the noise from the Piazza Mussolini was about . He had not come back . Now they sat in the darkness of the cellar of the Mansion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and waited and listened . " If we can only last into the night , " Mazzola said . " They 'll forgetus . The people 's memory is short . " Mazzola was always hoping for the best . There was another shout from the piazza , this time loud enough to seem to come right through the stones of the house and it made the baker begin to weep . " All I ever did for them was to bake their bread and now they want to come and harm me , " Francucci said . He was becoming obsessed with the idea that the people wanted to put him in his own bread ovens and bake him alive . " We must find a way to surrender to them before they can come to us , " Vittorini said . " In that way we can surrender on our own terms . " Little by little , as the day wore on , the mail clerk was assuming command in the cellar . He was not a Fascist , but he was a paid employee of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call himself , and since Vittorini is above all things a man of form he felt it his duty to be counted with the recognized legal machinery of government . If the Communists ever take over Italy or Santa Vittoria , Vittorini will hang a picture of Marx in the post office. 42'The thing we must do now is seize the initiative , " Vittorini said . " Very beautiful words , " Dr. Bara said . " Well stated . " The most impressive fact about Vittorini , more impressive even than his character , is the uniform he is entitled to wear , and which he wears on all state and religious holidays , and which he had the wisdom to put on this morning . It is from one of the fine regiments although no one remembers the name of it now or the number . It was made from a white whipcord twill that had been cleaned and bleached so many times that it was impossible to look directly at Vittorini in the sunlight . Across his chest he wore a red-and-white-and-green silken sash , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk like a sun rising from the sea . There were black patent-leather boots that flared out at the knee and a sword in a golden scabbard that clinked against the cobblestones when he crossed the piazza to enter the church . The green epaulets are trimmed with gold braid , but most of all it is Vittorini 's hat . The hat is made of shiny black patent leather with a little stubby visor and from the top , which is high , cascades a fall of cock 's plumes , a shiny black-and-green shower of them so that when Vittorini walks Vittorini ripples . " We must discover the nature of the enemy , " Vittorini told them , " and capitulate to it . They must not come and take ; we must give . It is the only way . " He shook his head to emphasize his point , and the dark river of feathers began to run again . " These are very beautiful words , " the doctor said . " Where in Christ is Pelo ? " Copa said. 441HE IRON GRILLWORK of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been burning for half the day and it was hot to the touch , but Bombolini never felt the burning when he crawled up onto the walk . He sank onto the iron and almost at once he slept . He had no intention of ever getting off the tower . He had prepared himself to die . He even yearned for the release of dropping softly down through the softness of the afternoon sky . He knew the people in the piazza were waiting for his last performance and he would n't disappoint them , but at the moment he was too tired even to contemplate dying . That would have to wait until he woke again , unless he rolled off the walk while he slept . Until then he lay stretched on the iron slats and burned . When he did wake he was conscious of three things . His eyes were pressed against the open slots of the grillwork and he could45see from the shadows of things far below him that time , a good deal of time , had passed . Part of his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a track through the terraces . The road was ankle-deep in dust , and white and bone dry , and it looked as if it had been drawn through the green terraces by a piece of white chalk . At each step a plume of dust spiraled up behind the cart and hung in the still air of late afternoon like a white banner . I am thirsty , Bombolini thought . I am dying of thirst . He could see the people working on the terraces in the vineyards , deep among the vines , working in the shaded tunnels of fat , green grape leaves , resting in the cool of the wine-green shade . And he could hear the sound of water bubbling by his ear , just on the other side of the thin concrete skin of the water tank . I am being driven crazy , Bombolini thought . And finally he became conscious that someone else was on the tower with him . From the other side of the tank came a rhythmic sound , a soft and steady lapping like waves on the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will find out who is on the tower , he told himself . He tried to say something , but there was no sound . He tried to move and found that it was impossible . I ca n't even kill myself , he said to himself , and he sighed , and then his eyes saw the wine bottle , the cork out of the neck , standing at attention like a little soldier a few inches away from his hand . I will drink a little of this wine and then roll off , he told himself . The wine was hot from the sun , but the heat did n't bother Bombolini . He could feel the wine run down his throat and enter his stomach and then begin to course through the bulk of his body as if it were the sun itself . The second swallow was easier and each one after that became easier , every mouthful exploding insidehim like a small hot sun , the source of life itself running inside him . He could feel it go poom in his stomach . The wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a man who has lost too much blood . When he was through with the bottle he found he could sit up , and he leaned against the concreteand all at once allowed his legs to drop over the side of the catwalk , which caused a great shout from the piazza . " Who 's on the tower ? " he said. 46 " Fabio . " The sound stopped but then it resumed , the slap , slap of the paintbrush against the concrete . " I knew it would be Fabio , " Bombolini said . It was an effort for him to talk . " If anyone would come for me I knew it would be Fabio . Fabio ? " " Yes ? " " God shower His blessings on you , Fabio . " Fabio was unable to answer . Things like this embarrass the people here . It might be all right for Sicilians , but not here . They are very emotional and vulgar and sentimental , much too emotionalfor us . " Let me see you , Fabio . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the catwalk starts to fall off . " " Fascist bastards , " Bombolini said . " They cheated on the specifications . They were supposed to put up a ladder and they put up that pipe and pocketed the difference . They were supposed to put a platform up here and they put up this thing . How far are you now ? " Fabio had already painted out MUSSOLINI IS ALWAYS RIGHT and was halfway through the eight DUCE 'S . " Four more to go , eh ? " " Yes . Whoever did it , overdid it , " Fabio said . " I did it , " Bombolini said . Fabio was silent . It embarrassed him to think of a man risking his life to climb a tower and write DUCE DUCE DUCE all over the side of it . And he could not imagine this man as ever having been young . " I was young once , you know . I was tall and lean . I used to look like Garibaldi . I had long shiny-black hair . I wonder what made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through I was n't even tired . " Fabio went on with the painting . " I know what you 're thinking , Fabio . You do n't have to tell me , " Bombolini said . " But you have to try and understand how it was then . It was n't like this now at first , Fabio . He was beautiful at first , Fabio . He was promises for us . " They felt the tower tremble and they gripped the iron railing , 47but then it passed . The mountain rises and falls here , a little bit each day , like a giant shifting in his sleep . " And what promises , Fabio . I do n't mean the stupid ones like building the army and making Italy fierce again . They were going to help us build a school and pay for teachers . Everybody was going to join in . They were going to help us build a road , and we were going to plant the hillsides with grass and trees so the land would stay on the hills and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more landslides . We believed that , Fabio . Oh , there was excitement then , Fabio . Everything seemed possible . And we believed . " " How could you ? " Fabio said . " You believed because you wanted to believe . " " Yes . And because he believed , too . I really think Mussolini be-lieved . " " And then none of it happened . " " Some of it happened . This thing , this tower , happened . Oh , we were going to be like America here , Fabio . Look . " The wine seller pointed although Fabio could not see him . " Can you see Scarafaggiofrom where you are ? " Fabio said that he could . " When the tower was built they fell down in the streets with envy from looking at us . Our turn next , ' they said . It 's happening . The miracle is happening . ' " He told Fabio of the famous morning when the tower was to be dedicated . The dignitaries had come from Montefalcone in cars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flowers . A great flag had covered the top of the tower and when the string was pulled and the tank was revealed , there , shiningfresh and black in the morning sun , was MUSSOLINI IS ALWAYS rucrrr and all the DUCE 'S , and on the catwalk was Italo Bombolini . " I was a hero once , for a few days , and then they turned the water off , " Bombolini said . " After that I was a fool . " When the leaders from Montefalcone had gone The Band assumedcontrol of the water tower and began to charge for the water . When the grape growers refused to pay , the water was turned off , and soon the cement spillways began to fill with leaves and dirt and the people went back to the old way , praying to Godto send rain , and He was , as always , not quite generous enough . But the people forgot about the tower . While he talked Bombolini threw the bottle off the tower , and there was a shout from the people as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tinkle of glass on the roof of the CooperativeWine Cellar . A minute or two afterward an old man with white hair and a face as red as wine came out onto the roof and shook his fist at them . It was Old Vines , the keeper of the wine . " I 've upset the sleep of the wine , " Bombolini said . " If he had a rifle he would shoot us off this tower . Are you almost done ? " " Yes . Two more DUCE 'S and one DU . " " I ran out of paint . No , " he said , " it was n't Mussolini himself at first . We did n't blame him . It was the water . The country might have been falling apart , but we could n't see it . You know what The Master says . Men are apt to deceive themselves in big things , but they rarely do so in particulars : " " I do n't know who The Master is . " " Niccolo Machiavelli , " Bombolini said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? " Fabio said that he had . " Well I read him . I memorize him , " the wine seller said . " I have read The Prince forty-three times . " The young man was astonished by this information , and he did n't believe it . His father had once told him that beneath Bombolini'sclownish exterior there was a better mind than anyone could expect , but Fabio had never been able to see any sign of it . " I do n't suppose there is any more wine ? " Fabio thought about it . If Bombolini got drunk it might be the end of them both , and yet the wine had made the journey down seem possible . He opened the knapsack and uncorked the second bottle of wine and slid it along the catwalk . " God shower blessings on you , Fabio . Rain them down on you . Flood you with them , Fabio . God drown you in blessings . " And he began to drink the hot red wine . They were silent while he drank . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I 'm going off this tower , Fabio . " " Oh no , " Fabio said . " I ca n't disappoint my audience . Look at them down there . They 've been waiting for me all day . " " I did n't come up here for nothing . " " Can you imagine what they would say ? The poor son of a bitch ca n't even fall off the tower . " The young man began to paint more swiftly . The paint was running short , and he was becoming tired . If he was ever to get Angela 's father down , it would have to he done soon , before he got too tired , before darkness fell on them , before the effect of the wine began to wear off . The men and the women were on their way up from the terracesby then . Wherever Fabio looked he could see people coming out from the shadows of the vines onto the track that comes up the mountain from the terraces . A great number of them were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second bottle the noise from the lower piazza , and now from the Piazza of the People as well , was the loudest of the day . Fabio by then had reached the bottom of the bucket and was on the last letter . It was strange , but there was exactly enough paint left to paint out the last letter , a U , and not a brushful more . " Now throw the bucket , " Bombolini said . Fabio threw the first bucket far out over the town , away from the piazza , out over the Fat Wall so that no one could get hurt . " Now the brush . " he threw the brush . There was a shout from the crowd . He threw the cheese , the olives , the second bucket , and each time the crowd roared and the noise grew louder and by the time Fabio threw the knapsack the piazza was in an uproar . " All right , let 's go now , " Fabio shouted . He had counted on the excitement to stir the wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catwalk where Bombolini sat , and as he did the rusted iron bolts that had been drilled into the concrete years before suddenly cried out , screamed , in protest . He ran along the narrow walk and past Bomholini and on to the spiked pipe so that his weight was no longer on the catwalk . Now the people in the piazza were silent . There was no sound from the city at all . " They do n't want you to fall , do you see ? " Fabio said . " If they wanted you to fall they would be shouting for you . " While he talked he reached up and began to work the lengths50of rope under the arms and across the hack and around the waist of Bombolini . His plan was crude , but Fabio felt it might work He would tie the wine seller to the pipe , literally lash him to it , and then bring him down it spike by spike . He would place Born- bolini 's foot on the next rung , or spike , below and then work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was secured there he would lift the next foot down . He would bring him down , all bound with ropes , like a bear being brought down from the high mountains . He made Bombolini slide along the narrow cat- walk until he was at the pipe and then dip down until his feet could find the spikes to stand on . Even from where they were , so high above the piazza , they could hear the people suck in their breaths . When he was tied to the pipe they did n't start at once , because both of them were tired even then . " Why are you doing this for me , Fabio ? " Bombolini asked . Fabio did n't answer him . How could he mention Angela ? He wondered if he would have been on this pipe now for anyone else 's father , but then he realized that only Angela 's father would be doing such a thing . " Why ? " " Because you were a man in trouble . It is people 's responsibility to help others in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I do n't know where you get ideas like that . It is people 's responsibility to look after themselves and nothing more . Let us try a step . " Fabio lifted Bombolini 's right foot and brought it down to the next spike below , and then he climbed up so that his head was level with Bombolini 's waist and he worked the ropes down a foot or more . They did it several times and rested . " Fabio ? " " Yes . " " I want you to know one thing , Fabio . If I ever get off this tower and I am alive , if there is ever one thing in the world that you want and I can give it to you , I want you to ask me for it and I will give it to you . " Why could n't he say it right then ? Why could n't he be honest with himself and with this man he had lashed to a spiny pipe and whose life he was saving at the risk of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is one thing : Angela ; I want your daughter Angela in marriage . Instead , all he could do was murmur , " Come on , come on , " and feel himself turning red . Just before they began again , Bombolini began to point to the north . " Oh , my God , " he said . " Can you see that ? Can you see there ? " " Yes . Something is burning , " Fabio said . " Some city is on fire . " They could see a cloud of gray , which the late afternoon sun turned gold at the top . It rose from a city which sat on the top of a mountain like a crown , and the crown was in flames . " The whole mountain is burning , " Bombolini said , and it was true . IN THE Leaders ' Mansion they could hear the shouts from the piazza , and the cheering . The noise was now steady and they knew the crowd was growing , but none of them was ready to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would Pelo tell a thing like that ? " Mazzola asked . " Because Pelo is a bastard , that 's why , " Copa said . Pelo had come back from the Piazza Mussolini and when no one in the Piazza of the People was looking he had knocked twice on the door as directed . " Who are they cheering ? " Vittorini had called . " Bombolini . " Vittorini could not believe his ears . " Italo Bombolini , " Pelo said . " The wine seller . The wine merchant . The Sicilian boob . " " I do n't believe you , " Vittorini said . " But it is the truth , " Pelo said , and then he had run . And ever since then the noise had grown louder and with it had grown the need for The Band to know who was the leader so they could plan some kind of counteraction . " But suppose it is true , " Dr. Bara said . " Then we will have to deal with Bombolini , " Vittorini said . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If an insane mob has chosen Bombolini then we have no choice but to deal with the man the mob has chosen . " " Ah , well , " the doctor said , " we will soon find out who the leader is , whether we want to or not . " And Francucci began to weep again . " I want the priest . I want my priest . I want to make my last confession , " the baker said , and then some of the women began to weep as well . " Shut up and start acting like a man , " Copa shouted at him . " I do n't know how , " Francucci said . " He 's right though , " Vittorini said . " We need the priest . Every member of the fiancheggiatori must be united for the common defense . " The fiancheggiatori is the alliance of the Crown and the Vatican with the bureaucracy and big business which forms the traditional combination of power in this country . The man who can keep the fiancheggiatori satisfied and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the kingdom . It was one of the postmaster 's favoritewords , but as Babbaluche pointed out one day the only thing missing from the combination was the people . They sent a young boy into the piazza to go to the bell tower and summon the priest . " Tell him someone is dying , " Mazzola said . " That will be sure to bring him . " " They put Francucci in a far corner of the cellar , in the deepest part of the darkness , but even from there he could be heard , saying it over and over like a litany in the church . " They are going to roll me in flour and sprinkle me with water . They are going to put me in an oven and bake me like my bread . " They are going to roll me in flour and sprinkle me with water .... " * * * " No , I do n't believe it , " Mazzola was saying when the boy came back with the priest . " I refuse to believe it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be insane enough to choose Bombolini for a leader . " But Padre Polenta told them the same thing , and they were forced to believe it . " Yes , it 's true , " the priest said . " The people are cheering Bombo-lini . " " But why ? Why Bombolini ? " " It is in the nature of mobs to cheer fools , " the priest said . " Now where is the dying man ? " Doctor Bara waved his hand around the room . " Everywhere , " he said . " All of us . It is only a matter of time . " There was a great shout from the piazza then . The force of it was so strong they could feel its weight on the door . And each shout was followed by one after it and then another , like soldiers on the march . The shouts grew so loud and so steady that Francuccihimself could no longer hear his own litany. * * *The shouts were the counting . Fabio had gotten Bombolini three quarters of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the piazza had counted the number of rungs that still remained and when there were fifty of them the people began to shout the number left . " Forty-nine . " " Forty-eight . " Great explosions of sound . The progress would come in flurries , four or five rungs , and when the two men got tired and held on , the people held the number and repeated it , over and over , until the men went on . " Forty-seven , forty-seven , forty-seven . . . " Like a steam enginewaiting in the station . They had come to see Bombolini fall off the tower , but now the mood had changed . Now they were cheering him down . When there were only thirty-four or thirty-five spikes still to go , however , with the end of the ordeal so near and yet with the distance still great enough so that if he slipped and fell he would die , Born- bolini found he could go no further . His leg muscles had become like strands of wet pasta . They trembled and quivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ropes on the pipe like a quarter of beef in the market place . What happened to Fabio then must be seen at least as having the hand of God behind it . He was coming hack up the pipe to put Bombolini 's feet back on the spikes to keep him from being squeezed to death by the ropes when the grappa flask that he was carrying clinked against the pipe . He had forgotten about it , since Fabio does n't think in terms of alcohol ; but at the moment when he needed it , at a time truly of desperation , something caused the bottle to strike the metal . The grappa they distill here is strong . It can be used in a ciga- rette lighter or in a blowtorch . On a cold day it is like carrying around a bottle of live coals or putting a stove in your pocket . Fabio took the flask from his shirt and reached up , and because Bombolini was now too tired even to drink , Fabio began pouring little surprises of grappa down his throat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piazza they could see Bombolini 's vacant glazed stare pass from his face . His color , which had passed through purple into a whiteness like the whiteness of the dead , began to return to him . When Fabio got his feet back onto the spikes Bombolini was able to keep them there and the boy could feel muscles in the legs once more . " Give me the bottle , " Bombolini said . He began to pour the grappa down his own throat , steady strong swallows now , perhaps one a minute , an ounce or more each swallow and in five or six minutes the flask of grappa was emptied and he hurled it down into the piazza . He had drunk ten ounces of grappa in less than ten minutes . " We 're going down , " Bombolini shouted to Fabio . There was a great cheer from the people in the piazza . " Take off the ropes . " Fabio shook his head . Then Bombolini began to work the ropes off himself , and when they were loose he threw them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was slow , but he also was 56 steady and careful , the foot feeling for the next spike , finding it , the whole body balanced correctly before the step and then the step itself . " Thirty-four , thirty-four , thirty-four . " Another step . " Thirty-three , thirty-three , thirty-three . " They could hear it all the way up the Corso Mussolini , they could hear it through the barred doors and the stones of the Leaders ' Mansion . They could hear it from every corner of the Piazza of the People , although they did n't know what it meant then . " It 's starting again , " Dr. Bara said in the cellar . " They 're getting ready to come again . It 's stronger now . " Dr. Bara had no fear for himself . It was his belief that the people would be too selfish to harm their only doctor . " You had better have a plan , " he said . " I have a plan , " Vittorini said . He said it so vigorously that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make him take our surrender . It is now a matter of timing , " the old soldier said . " Timingis all . " " And do n't allow ourselves to forget one thing , " Dr. Bara said . " The Italian soldier is a master at the art of surrender . " It made them feel better , all of them , and the feeling lasted until they heard a noise , the noise , one so strong that they felt it , the loudest noise almost certainly ever heard until then in Santa Vittoria. * * *He had gotten down , by himself , to the last spike on the pipe and then his feet had touched the stones of the Piazza Mussolini . At that moment there was a great cheer and he had fallen forward and they caught him before he hit the stones and began to carry him , to shove him actually , through the mass of the people in the piazza toward his cart . They put him up on a great solid twowheeledSicilian cart , made of iron oak with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and covered with sweet religious sayings , and when the hands released him he fell off and had to be caught once more and put back up onto the seat , where theypropped him up so that he would n't fall again . It was at this time that he said the eight words that were the occasion for the greatestsingle sound in the history of the city . Before telling you the words , it is necessary to tell one thing about this place and the people who live in it . Life here is hard , harder than outsiders can ever see . No one gets anything here without working for it , and many work hard and get nothing . It sometimes seems in truth that the harder the people work the less they have to show for it , as if work creates loss . Who knows where the fault begins or where it lies ? The only truth is that there is never quite enough of anything here . Why do they stay ? For the same reason that all peasants stay . They hold on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are fearful of starvation . Because of this , the greatest fear of any peasant is that someone will take something from him that he has worked for . The pain of it is too unbearable . It is one reason all peasants are ungrateful . If someone gives a peasant something , he can only assume that it is a trick , or that the person does n't want the thing he has given , or that the person is crazy . All of this , then , is why the greatest joy of Italian peasants , and maybe peasants all over the world as well , is to get something they did n't work for : to get something for nothing . And the best things to get are the things that are sweated for each day . A pearl is good to get for nothing , but its value is n't known in terms of sweat . Pearls are good , but bread is better. * * *So the shout , then ; this noise  --  now it can be understood . They put Fabio in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high front seat and they began to push on the heavy wheels , back and forth at first to gain momentum to start the cart back up the Corso Mussolini , when he motioned to them . They did n't hear him clearly at first . " Say it once more , " a man shouted at him . " Clearly . " He made a last effort . He swallowed and cleared his throat and called out . " Free wine for the people of Santa Vittoria. " 58He slumped down in the seat , face forward , and it is doubtful if either he or Fabio ever heard the sound itself that greeted the words , although it soared up the Corso and it cascaded into the Piazza of the People and it thundered against the door of the Leader 's Mansion and it caused the stained-glass windows of Santa Maria of the Burning Oven to tremble . The Corso is steep and narrow , and it was hard to get the cart moving , because not enough people could get behind it . But a crowd also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheer pressure of people , the desire of the crowd , seemed to be enough to start the cart moving upward . At the stone steps the men were forced to stop and rock the big iron-rimmed wheels back and forth to get up over the stones , and as they did they began shouting  --  " Bom " as they went forward , " be " as they rolled back , " li-i-ii " as they strained up over the stone , and a short , explosive " ni " when they made it over the lip to the next step . The people behind the men pushing the cart took up the shout , and soon the Corso and then the whole of Santa Vittoria was vibrating with it . They could hear it in the highest part of High Town  --  " Bom bo li-ii-ini ! Born ni ! "  --  and over the walls and in the high pastures . One old woman who was watching oxen said it sounded like the start of a great storm and made her afraid , and Luigi Longo , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , said it sounded like a trombone announcing the angel of death. * * *Vittorini had not been idle . In the Leaders ' Mansion they were ready for Bombolini . They stood behind the heavy oak door and listened to the shouts of the people and waited for the proper moment . The barricades had been pulled aside and the door was opened a crack to allow Vittorini to see into the Piazza of the People , and behind him were The Band . Copa stood just behind the old soldier with a medallion of the office of mayor held in his hand . Mazzola , behind Copa , held the great brass key to the city , which unlocks nothing here . Dr. Bara had put on a white coat and hung a stethoscope around his neck . Polenta , unfortunately , was dressed only in a soup-stained cassock , and on his head was the59little skull cap which was ragged and stained with oil , but because he thought he had been coming to offer the last rites he had his tall silver crucifix and this would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mansion and they had stripped it of every religious statue and holy picture the house possessed . Those who had no picture or soapstone saint were given a baby or young child to hold in their arms . Vittorini himself had taken the Italian flag from a hallway and had worked the flag down the edge of his sword , so that it hung like a banner when the blade was extended . " Open it just a little wider , " Vittorini said . The sound coming up into the piazza from the Corso was deafening . The soldier was at military attention . " The timing is everything now , " he called to the doctor , but Dr. Bara was unable to hear him. * * *Before anything else , they saw Bombolini 's head rise from the Corso Mussolini , up toward the piazza , and then they saw his neck and his shoulders and then they saw the top of the Sicilian cart and finally as the cart came up into the Piazza of the People , they saw the bodies of the people pushing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " IIe comes like a king from the East . " He was above them all , riding along above them , swaying back and forth above them , as if he were floating on a restless sea . The people were still shouting his name , and they came flooding out of the confines of the Corso , spilling out into the vastness of the piazzaand around Bombolini and the cart , like the first wave of a tide . Someone in the Leaders ' Mansion moved toward the door then , but Vittorini held him back . " Not yet , not yet , " he shouted . The cart had no direction . Once out of the Corso , it had gotten out of the control of the men who had been pushing it . It rolled out into the center of the piazza , propelled there by the pressure of the people behind it . It wanted to turn to the left in the direction of the wineshop and away from the Mansion of the Leaders , but the men pushing the wheels were unable to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cart continued out toward the Fountain of the Pissing Turtle . " Now ! " Vittorini commanded . The door of the Leaders ' Mansion was thrown wide open . The old soldier was the first to go through it , his sword pointed directlyout in front of him with the flag fluttering in the wind that blows every evening in this city . Copa came behind him , the imitaton gold of the mayor 's medallionglinting in what still remained of the sun . Mazzola held up the key to the city of Santa Vittoria . After him came Dr. Bara , and with Bara was Padre Polenta with the silver crucifix held aloft for everyone in the piazza to see , and then came the women holding up the statues and the holy pictures and the old and young women with the babies held up or at their breast . " Now ! " Vittorini shouted again . He lifted up his sword so that the flag was overhead , the priest lifted up his crucifix and began to wave it up and down . Mazzola waved the key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the pictures and all the statues and all the babies waved up and down . Nothing happened . The cart continued out into the piazza . Allow this much for Copa . He is a man of action , and action was required . " The sons of bitches , " he shouted to Vittorini . " They try to ignoreour surrender . " He ran back into the Mansion and when he came outside again with the gun , the cart was no more than ten feet away from the fountain . He unloaded his first shot from the double-barreled shotgun over the crowd in the piazza and the second was even lower , so low that several people were cut and stung by the bird shot . The movement in the piazza stopped , the pushing ceased , the pressure on the cart stopped . Copa put two more shells in the gun . One went over the heads of the people in the back of the crowd and in the silence the explosion sounded much louder . The other he fired into the bell tower and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cling and then the bell itself to rock lightly back and forth with the clapper just touching the brass and sounding a mournful biting , biting that we use on the days of death . " Once more , " Vittorini said , and all of the pictures and the me- dallions and the sacred cross and the babes started to rise and fall again . And allow this much for Bombolini . Although he was drunk and exhaustion had stolen much of his sensibility , it was he  --  of all the people in the piazza standing there with their mouths agape looking at the smoke curling from the end of Copa 's gun and watching the wind ripple the feathers of Vittorini 's hat and Vitto- rini 's flag  --  who knew at once what was taking place . There is a line by Machiavelli which Bombolini has written on a card and carries with him . Fortune is a woman . It is necessary , if you wish to master her , to ry ' y take her by force before she has a chance to resist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw his fortune and he raped her on the spot . " To the Leaders ' Mansion , " he called . There was a moment when it seemed that the marriage might never be consummated . The will of the crowd was for wine . But the people had a decency about them , they were willing to wait for their wine and with a great effort , with an agonizing slowness , the cart was turned and the people in its path were pushed aside , and Bombolini and the Sicilian cart began to bounce along the cobblestones of the piazza in the direction of the Leaders ' Man- sion . It was his determination to say something memorable to seize the occasion , but he never had the chance to open his mouth . " By the powers vested in me by the legitimate government of the city of Santa Vittoria , " Vittorini began . His voice , like that of all good soldiers , was loud and carried command . What Dr. Bara had said about the Italian soldiers and surren- der was correct . Vittorini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old soldier talked for almost one half hour without , as anyone could notice , taking a breath . Since they did n't understand the purpose of the talk , the people in the piazza did n't understand the words , but they liked to hear them because they were beauti- 62 ful and Vittorini was full of eloquence and his sentences flowed like rivers and his words glided like swans on still waters . It is not necessary to put down all the details . It is enough to know this : that in exchange for a sacred and a solemn vow by Bombolini that the persons and the property of those who had gone before  --  which meant The Band  --  would be respected , he , Italo Bombolini , would be handed the key to the city and the medallion of the mayor would be placed around his neck . " Do I so have your sacred and solemn vow ? " Vittorini said . " Remember , it is witnessed by the priest and thus by God Himself . " Someone prodded Bombolini . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vittorini turned directly toward the people in the piazza then . While Polentasanctified the pledge by making the sign of the cross , Vittorinilifted his sword and the flag . " Citizens of Santa Vittoria , " he cried out to them . " I give you your new leader . " There was almost no response from the people . They had not understood , and it still was not clear to them . What response there was  --  a few cheers and a few groans , a shout of laughter from Babbaluche , the sound of snoring from Fabio in the back of the cart  --  soon died away in the rush of the late afternoon wind and finally the only sound at all was that of Vittorini 's flag fluttering . It was beginning to grow dark in the piazza , although the sun was still bright on the roof tops of the surrounding houses . Vittorini made a small sign with his hand ; he turned it upward as if to say to Bombolini , " I have done my job , the rest is up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier . " Get the medallion , " he said . " They do n't want him . Get the medallion back . We have made a terrible mistake . " But at that moment Bara was proven wrong . Bombolini had turned around on the cart and back to his people and had said something to them , and this was followed by an enormous cheer and a great surge of movement . Vittorini turned to Bara . " And what would you call that ? " Men seized the great cart wheels . They almost lifted that iron oak cart into the air in their eagerness to turn it around and drive it back across the piazza. 63 " And what would you call that if he is n't the leader ? " Vittorini said . " They would have torn us apart . " The women lowered the holy pictures and the statues , and Padre Polenta began to walk back across the clearing piazza to the bell tower . The others turned around and started back inside the Leaders ' Mansion , because one of the promises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mansion by sundown that evening . The wine seller had said four words : " And now your wine . " * * *When Rosa Bombolini heard the sounds coming up the Corso Mussolini she had shut the shutters of her windows and run downstairs and closed and locked the iron gate that guards the front of the wineshop and then gone back upstairs and stood behind the shutters , where she could see into the Piazza of the People without being seen . Her husband 's cart came to a stop twenty feet from the wineshop . " Open the gates , " Bombolini shouted . When there was no answer , someone handed Bombolini a cobblestone that had been pried out of the piazza . Bombolini gave the stone to one of the younger Pietrosantos and made a sign , and the young man sent the stone crashing against an upstairs shutter . " Open the gates , " he shouted again . The shutter opened this time and his wife looked down from the window into the cart . " I open no gates to no mob , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no mob . These are the citizens of Santa Vittoria , " Bornbolinicalled back . She made a gesture with the fingers of her right hand that only men ever make here and then only when they are among men . " I order you to open these gates , " Bombolini called . " Order ? " She made that laugh that all Santa Vittoria is familiar with , the one they are afraid of . " Whose order ? " The words were spit on her lips . " The order of the mayor of the city of Santa Vittoria . " He held up the key to the city and then the medallion of theoffice of mayor , and the people cheered . She opened the shutters wide then . " Up the fat you-know-what of the indescribable mayor of this indescribable city , " she shouted . The new mayor looked very tired then and sad . He pointed to the gates . " Down , " he said . He described the action with his hands . " Pull them down . " She was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I own this house . I own this wineshop . You listen to me . You touch those gates and you never walk into this house again . " It would be his first decision as mayor . He did n't look up at her when he made it , but the decision was made . " Down , " he ordered . " Take them down . " It was the Sicilian cart that did the job . They lifted Bombolini down from the cart and then they ran it back and forth to build up the proper rage , like a bull preparing to make his charge , and all at once they released it . The gate was no match for the cart . The iron was old and the hinges and bolts that held it were rusted . It gave almost a once , and after that the front door gave , and then the entire front of the wineshop . The plate-glass window came all apart and it shattered into the shop and into the piazza . The reign of Italo Bombolini had begun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pee ' . ple of Santa Vittoria acted in some other way than they did that night . But the people acted like proper Santa Vittorians and like people getting something for nothing . Because the wine was free , everyone drank too much , and drunkenness and greed are never gratifying . Someone set fire to a goat and it went blazing down the Corso Mussolini and nearly set fire to a stall . Someone threw a bottle from a roof and cut someone . It was not all bad . Some of the young people had accordions and a shepherd came down from the high pastures with pipes , and although they do n't dance here often the men danced and then the women and finally even the men with the women . 66 f There was an omen for Santa Vittoria that evening , the one thing that for a time calmed the people . While the first barrel of wine was being drunk , just after the sun had gone down , a strange early evening star was seen glittering to the north and east of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shining in the gold of the late sun before dipping down into the shadows of the mountains . Everyone agreed it was a good sign . " That bastard Bombolini 's in luck , " someone said . " Someone is looking out for him . " If the harvest was good this year , for years to come people would look into the sky on this day to see the good omen again and announce that there would be another good harvest . If someonedied , his family would look for the star on this day in fear that they would see it and someone else would die that year . But the star was forgotten , that night at least , when the second barrel was opened . No one at the end was sure how much wine was drunk . Bombolini says that three hundred gallons were drunk . It is a lot of wine for one thousand people , when many of them are very old and very young and over half of them are women . Long before midnight the dancing stopped . No matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the terraces in the morning when the sun rose . Only the young men were still up . A team of Turtles was playing a kind of soccer game with a team of Goats in the piazza , but even that was quiet and slow . One of the players found Fabio sleeping on the wet stones by the Fountain of the Pissing Turtle . " You 'd better get up , " he told him , " or you 'll die in the night air . " " I have no place to go , " Fabio said . He was more tired than drunk . The soccer player pointed him in the direction of the Leaders ' Mansion . " There 's room for you in there . Bombolini is living there now . His wife has thrown him out . " Fabio crossed the piazza and stood outside the door . There was a light inside the house . He knocked , very lightly , and when no one answered he tried the door and it opened and he went inside . He was surprised to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his side , and reading a book . He wanted to say somethingbut could not think of the right thing , and he continued across the room until he was behind the mayor . The book was old and grimy . It had been abused by use and time . Lines of the text were underlined , and some of them were underlined two and three times , and some of these were in differentcolors , with all kinds of notes written in the margin . One read : " No , not true in Santa Vittoria . " Others Fabio could see said , " how very true " and " Try and tell that to the Fascists . " " Oh , " Bombolini said . He closed the book . " I did n't mean to scare you . " " Well you succeeded . " Fabio came around in front of the new mayor . " You were reading your Machiavelli . " " I 'm going to need him now . He 's going to have to tell me what to do . " Fabio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pieces the Band had left behind . " I want to stay here for the night if I may . " " Fabio . You may stay here for the rest of your life , " Bombolini said . " No . Just for the night . I am very tired . " Bombolini picked up the light and took Fabio upstairs to a room where several blankets and an old coat were stretched out on the floor . " I want you to take my bed , " he said , and when Fabio refused he forced him to lie down on it and went away with the light . Fabio has no idea how long he was there before the mayor returned . " Fabio ? Are you awake ? Listen to this . " He thumbed through the book he held and held up a hand with one finger extended , a gesture Fabio was to recognize later as the sign that Bombolini was about to quote from Machiavelli . " The wise ruler ought never to keep faith when by doing so it would be against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who says that ? " 68 " The Master , " Bombolini said . " The wise fox , Niccold Machia. velli . " " Why are you asking me ? " " Do I have to keep those promises I made ? " " You gave your word , " Fabio said . " Your sacred word . " Bomboliniclosed the book with a loud noise . " I knew I should have asked Babbaluche , " he said . There was darkness , and Fabio slept . But when he woke again there was a light in the room once more . " Just one other sentence , Fabio . An interpretation . " The mayor held up his hand . " ' Men must be either caressed or annihilated . They will revenge themselves for small injuries , but they ca n't do so for great ones . The harm the leader does must be such that he need not fear revenge . ' What do you make of that ? " Fabio did not want to be part of any bloodletting , but he was tired and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it means you 're supposed to kill them . " Bombolini thought about that for a while , and before he said anything else Fabio was asleep . " I think you are right , " he said sadly , because he had little stomach for blood and at the same time a respect for the words of The Master . The next time Fabio awoke , the room was light again , but this time the light came from the piazza . He had been able to sleep for several hours , and he felt better because of it . " Fabio della Romagna , I want you to join my cabinet , " Bombolinisaid to him . " I want you to be a minister in the Grand Council of the Free City of Santa Vittoria . " " I am flattered , " Fabio said , and it was the truth . " I am proud you ask me , but my place is in Montefalcone . I have to finish my studies at the academy . It would not be good to quit now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " For the duration . I need you . I need educated men . That 's what you will be , Minister of Education . No . Minister for Advanced Education . You can live right here . We 'll get a bed for you and a desk , and Angela will bring us something in the morning and make us supper at night . It wo n't be bad . " It was the thunderbolt again . It was all at once the most amazing idea that Fabio had ever heard  --  Angela carrying his breakfast ; 69Angela meeting in doorways , saying good morning and saying good night ; Angela preparing food for him with her own hands ; Angela meeting him by error and design and chance in all those personal and private ways that can only occur when two people are alone in a house . " I do n't know , " Fabio said . He could barely bring himself to talk . " Everything will be upset in Montefalcone . You said the Germanswere taking over the town . " " Yes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He took out a soiled card from his pocket and at the bottom added Fabio 's name to the list of names . The card was old and the names on it were old and only Fabio 's looked freshly placed on the card , and he realized with a start almost as strong as the one he had felt before that this man , whom they called the Sicilian boob , the least likely man in all of Santa Vittoria to ever become a leader , had for months and perhaps years been walking about with a fully formed government in his pocket . Bombolini closed the shutters and it was dark in the room once more . " You should sleep , " he said . " But before you do I want you to think about this so you can think about it while you sleep . The Master says it is necessary to rule by fear or rule by love . One way or the other . I want you to think about the course I should fol-low . " When Fabio awoke the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his skin . He thought about the night , the wine , the dancing  --  which he had n't done , although he had looked at others dance with her  --  the strange star in the sky , an omen for good or evil , and about the new thing , Angela and himself in this house and about something Bombolini had asked him to think about and which he had forgotten . He lay on the floor and became conscious of a strange sound coming from the piazza , a tinkling of glass , as if a river of glass were running across the piazza stones . When he looked out of the window he could see a group of old men and women with longhandledbrush brooms sweeping the streets and the piazzas , 70sweeping up the broken glass of the night before . Such a thing had never happened before in Santa Vittoria ; God 's winds swept and God 's rare rains washed . He was still watching the work with admiration when Bombolini came into the room , clean now and refreshed , although he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " I stole the idea from the Fascists . " " But how do you pay them ? " Bombolini smiled broadly and handed Fabio a square piece of paper. 3 THREE 3SANTA VITTORIA LIREThis paper redeemable forlegal currency at theend of the emergencyItalo Bombolini MayorThe Free City of Santa Vittoria " Do you really intend to honor it ? " Fabio asked . Bombolini was shocked by the suggestion . " You can fool the people about many things , but only a foolwould be foolish enough to fool the people about money . " " The Master , " Fabio said . " I 'm getting to recognize him . " It was clear that the mayor was very flattered . " In truth , Fabio , it was myself , " he said . Fabio was impressed . " You should write those down , " he said . " In truth , Fabio , I do n't write that well . If someone else could write them down ... " It was in this manner that The Discourses of Italo Bombolini came into being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere in the city . " The people are saying we were born under a lucky star . A good omen , a good sign . I hope they are right . " 71 " I hope they are right , " Fabio said . But all he could think about was when Angela would come with some broth or pasta . Bombolinileaned down toward him . " Do you remember I asked you to think about whether I should rule by fear or rule by love ? " Fabio told him that he did , but that he had had no thoughts . " Well rest your brain then , Fabio , " Bombolini said , " because I have made my decision . I have decided to be lovably fearful . " 72SHE STAB they saw was me . The omen sent to Santa Vittoria was myself . This is the place where I enter the story . It is the price I ask you to pay in return for hearing the story of Santa Vittoria , which is admittedly a better story than my own . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countrymen , my people , for twenty years ; an apology written in the hope that some will understand and even that if enough understand I might some day be able to go back to my home and rebuild what is left of my life . I will try to make it short and make the price as inexpensive as possible . On the morning that Fabio told the story of the death of Mussolini , after it , while he slept , I was flying in the Odessa Darling , a B-24 Liberator bomber , somewhere over Italy . I have figured since75that we might have crossed almost directly over Santa Vittoria at eight o'clock that morning , although no one here recalls a plane passing over that morning . I already knew the fate of Mussolini . The pilot of the Odessa Darling , Captain Buster Rampey , had told me about it before we took off that morning . " They kicked out that Muzzlini , you know that ? What do you think about it ? " I shrugged my shoulders . I thought nothing about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Captain Rampey said . " I thought you might want to be the first to know , you know ? You bein ' Eyetalian and all like that . " " No , sir . " " I just thought you would . " " No , sir . " It was our fourth mission , and the first over the mainland of Italy . We had bombed Pantelleria and Lampedusa and some other island I have forgotten , but this was to be the first flight over Italy . I recall the beginning of the flight very well , because every once in a while , when I feel trapped here on this mountain like a sailor in a small boat at sea , I feel like flying again , to get out of here , up above all these people I have come to know so well and who think they know me so well . We crossed the sea , the Tyrrhenian Sea , early that morning . We flew with the sun , flying low over the blue-green water and the shadow ran along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just beneath the surface . I never saw Italy until it came upon us , a surprise from the water , all green , so different from Africa , darkly green like the underside of grape leaves . We followed the coast , what I now know is called the Divine Coast , rushing along over the cliffs and the white houses clinging to the cliffs and the little towns strung along their steep sides and somewherewe suddenly turned in over the mainland . After that I did n't look at the land much , because my aim was to see and to shoot an Italian plane . The reason for this was that the other members of the Odessa Darling did n't trust me . One night after76he had been drinking in the Officer 's Club Captain Rampey came and found me in my barracks . " Tell me one thing true , Abrussi . If you was to see an Eyetalian plane in the air you would n't fire on it , would you ? " I told him that I would . He pronounced the word " fire " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now I can still recall every word the captain said to me and the way that he said them . " You do n't have to lie about it , Abrussi . I wo n't hold that against you . You think if my people left Texas and some war came up that I would go back and shoot at Texas people ? " I said that I thought he would if he were ordered to do it . He gripped me by the front of my shirt . " Shoot my brothers ? Shoot at my flesh and blood ? " He let go of my shirt in disgust . " I just wish you would be honest about it . Then I might be able to respect you . " After that I was accepted by the rest of the crew as a built-in handicap , like an engine that never functioned right . They even had a plan for me called Plan Paisan , in case of an attack by Italian planes . Lieutenant Marvell was to leave his post as navigatorand to man my machine gun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking then to prove them wrong . If planes were sighted I wanted to fire at them and hit them before Marvell could relieve me of my weapon . Then some time that morning , while passing over a patch of dark pine woods , the Odessa Darling flew into a grove of budding flak  --  puffs of black smoke and little flowerings of metal . The sky bloomed with them . I had thought we were through this dangerous garden and all of the bursts were behind us , when the plane leaped in the air as if it were suffering a convulsion . The plane shuddered and we started down all at once , in one great sudden dip , as if someone had pulled a plug in the sky . " Please Jesus , do n't let there be fire , " someone said . At the end of the drop the plane began to skid through the sky , slipping across it as if we were being towed on a wire cable , going77down but across the sky at the same moment , and then there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought we were brushing the tops of trees or mountains and then we held , the plane had gotten a hold of the sky again . He was a good pilot . It is strange now to think that I owe my life to Captain Rampey . For a long time we flew in silence , trying only to hold the plane in the sky , fearful of trying to turn or to even lift the plane . We flew on , low , and the mountain towns came floating up at us and then faded away like islands in a high green sea . After a period of time  --  how long it was I could n't say or even guess  --  we began to edge up in the sky again and much later Captain Rampey began to make the turn back again , to wheel the Odessa Darling around in a huge slow arc in the sky . There was no talking . We listened to the strange sounds we were making , they frightened us , and then Rampey called to Marvell . " I want you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . One directly on the line to home . " I could see Lieutenant Marvell checking his maps from where I stood at my post . He was a careful worker . " I got you one , " he said after a while . " We wo n't even have to bank for it . Name of . . . name of ... " " I do n't want to know the name , " the captain said . " Just tell me before we get there . " " Yes , sir . " " We did n't come this far for nothing . " " No , sir . " " Got to ditch these bombs some place . " " Yes , sir . " " Do n't want to waste the whole Goddamn day . " " Would n't do , sir . " " Would n't do at all . " We could see people along the roads , and I could even see the dust rising behind the carts when the oxen put their feet down . Some of the people waved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met some , I would ever tell the people the way their town had been chosen. 78They probably think it was an act of God or an act of War ; it would n't do them any good to know . When we were five minutes from the target area Lieutenant Marvell announced that it was time to begin to ease the Odessa Darling down . " I do n't see anything , " Captain Rampey said . " It 's just on the other side of that mountain , " Marvell said . " You would n't trick me , " Rampey said . " Sir ! " The Odessa Darling started down . " Going to get us some paisans today . " It was a good-sized town , a city really , about three or four times the size of Santa Vittoria . It was on the other side of the moun- tain , but on a smaller mountain of its own , below the taller moun- tain , and it covered the crest of it , all white and orange tiles , ringed by a wall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crown on the crest of the mountain . Going down on all sides of the mountain were the dark-green fields that I later came to know as terraced vineyards from my experience here . In the center of all this greenness , circled by its wall , from the air the city looked like the bull's-eye on an enormous dart board . " Marvell ? " " Sir ? " " You picked us a jewel , hear ? " There was trouble with the doors of the bomb bay ; some of the flak had damaged the mechanism that controlled them . The bom- bardier tried to work them open , but before he succeeded we were already over the city . " I can get you a target further down the line , " Marvell said . " No , I want this one , " Rampey said . They unscrewed the barrel of my machine gun and began to use it as a lever to pry the doors open . We were low then , and I could see the city clearly . The piazza was crowded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been market day . At one end of the piazza was a large building , much like here , that I took to be the town hall . At the other end stood the tower of the cathedral of the city. 79 " There 's your aiming stake , " Captain Rampey said . The shadow of the Odessa Darling slid over the town , across the wall and over the piazza and the church facade , over the orangeroofs , turning them for a moment a dark red , and then over the other wall , like a dark messenger . We have a saying in Santa Vittoria : " Good is recognized only when it goes away , evil when it comes . " But , in this case at least , it was n't true . When the shadow crossed over them the people looked up ; some just went back to their work and some of them waved to us . When the bomb bay doors opened the Odessa Darling swung around and came back for the town . Captain Rampey did n't wait for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city walls he said , " Kick ' em on out , " and all of us became bombardiers . We rolled the bombs through the door and pushed them through and kicked them out with our feet , and they began to follow each other down upon the city , wig-wagging back and forth the way the bombs do , swimming along after each other like fish in a school . You try to follow the bomb that you personally sent on its way , one that felt the touch of your hand or your foot , and you think that you do ; but when the explosions begin and the stones and the roofs and then the fire and the smoke begin to erupt you realize that you will never be able to tell exactly what you have done . We were low enough to see the confused game the people in the piazza were playing . At each explosion  --  the explosions seemed to walk across the town with giant strides toward the piazza  --  the people would run in one direction , and at the next they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just left . Eventually they must have found their heads , because the second time we turned and came back over the city the people in the piazza were gone . In all of the piazza there was just one man and he was kneeling in the center of it working the bolt of a hand operated rifle and aiming it at the Odessa Darling . " That son of a bitch could hurt someone , " Marvell said . This was the run on which the Soo-pound delayed-action demolitionbomb would be used . This is the heart and even the very soul of the Odessa Darling. 8o " You have it ready and I 'll tell you when , " Captain Rampey told the bombardier . He was an expert at this , a genius at it perhaps , the owner of a very special talent that God had given him and which could be used only once or twice in a lifetime . If it had n't been for war Rampey might never had known he possessed it . " Now , " he said ; and on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed to fly along with the Odessa Darling before arching over the town and suddenly dipping down , and as it did , every one of us , even the ones without the fine instinct of Captain Rampey , could see that it was going to be a success . It appeared when it reached it to just touch the gray slate roof of the cathedral and then to go through it so swiftly that the hole it made in the roof seemed to close behind it the way water does over a rock . It was a delayed-action bomb and with a bomb such as this there is always the fear that it might not explode , but then this one did , somewhere down among the dark cellars and in the foundation where a great many people from the piazza must have been hiding . The first sign of success was not the noise of the explosion or the sensation of pressure from it that can at times lift a plane into the air and drop it down like a boat when a wave runs beneath it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire facade , the great circular stained-glass window that had once been the front of the cathedral , coming apart all at once , every piece seeming to come apart at the same instant and floweringout onto the stones of the piazza . After that , the fire began , a spurt of flame from the bowels of the church that took a great part of the slate roof with it , and then the sound , so that when we began to pull up only the far walls of the cathedral still stood . The man with the rifle was gone . " There 's only the small bombs left , " Marvell said . " Let 's not waste them , " the captain said . The center of the city was flaming and hidden in smoke when we made our turn , but the far ends of the town were still not touched ; so it was decided to begin to drop the small bombs on the terraces down below the city wall so that we would be sure this way to hit the far ends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of them were even running along the top , and when the first of the bombs began landing down in the vine-81yards some of the people jumped down from the walls and began running in the direction of the bombs . They did n't seem to know what to do with themselves . An ox pulling a cart went mad with fear and began running down over the terraced walls until it must have broken its legs and the cart it was pulling landed on top of it . " Someone ought to put that thing out of its misery , " Lieutenant Marvell said . In one part of the city , out along the north walls , was an open rectangular patch of green , a different green from any that we had seen , a lighter green , more even and much brighter than the darker green of the grapevines , and as we came up on it I could see that it was a playing field and that the large red-tiled building next to the field was almost certainly the city school . In the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart from one another ; in between them , at regular intervals , were littledark stripes stretched out on the grass . There were white lines on the field , I suppose for soccer , and at first I thought the dark lines were some kind of markers for the game , but as we came on them I could see that they were children . The bombs were beginning to come up the terraces by then and the first of them were even reaching the walls , but the man and the woman still stood in the field and none of the children moved . I suppose the man and the woman thought it would frighten the children if they were to get down on the grass with them . When the bombs came nearer the children began to curl up , and in their black school uniforms they looked like little balls of soot rolled up on the bright-green grass . The sticks of bombs , the ones that might reach them , were already in the air , but I began to wish that I could hold them back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have trusted their teachers , because although the noise must have been getting terribly loud and frightening none of them moved ; they stayed exactly where they had been placed , out on the grass ; and it was right , because it is much safer to be out in the open than crouched under a school desk where one might be buried under the old beams and stones of the school and trapped there in fire . But I still have this feeling , about the bravery of their teachers and the bravery of the children . If only they had looked up they82might have seen the line of black things dropping and been able to get up and run to one side of the field away from them . But they stayed where they had been told to stay , face down on the playground , never moving at all until the first of the bombs landed among them , and even after the second and the third , when the bright-green grass began to fling up into the air along with pieces of the earth and the flame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A soldier does his duty , and this was my duty . And I think now that I might have been spared some of the pain , had it not been for the boy . When the bombs had stopped , I could see him runningacross the grass to what still remained of the school gate and I could see that his clothes were on fire and that the boy was burning . Even from where we were I could see that he held somethingwhite in his arms and I knew at once that it was important to know what it was . What can be so important for a boy to refuse to drop when he is burning . It is this that makes me wake up some nights and find that I am crying out to drop it and I find my arms are striking out and I am trying to put out the flames with my hands . The street outside the school was wide and there was no one in it , and so it was easy to follow the boy . It was impossible not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but instead of running down it he began to run up the street , and so I know that he must have been trying to reach his home and whoever took care of him there . He did n't run far . After a few steps he went down to his knees and he seemed to stay that way for a long time , although it was probably a very short time , I hope only a moment , before he fell , face forward , onto the stones of the street ; and as he did , the white thing that he was holding was freed and it began to roll and then to bounce its way back down the steepness of the street . It was his soccer ball , and it continued to bounce and roll away from him long after the boy had stopped burning and we had begun to pull up from the city to avoid the pillar of fire and smoke that was rising from it . But I could still see that white ball burning in my own eye , the way the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and then even that ceased and we had banked up and away from there and were headed back for Africa. 83 " That concludes the program for the afternoon , " Captain Rampey said . The shadow of the plane was leaping over the green fields , and behind us the city was burning like a crown set afire . " I will tell you one thing , " Marvell said . " We did us a job of work . " Those were the last words that I remember hearing on the Odessa Darling . I have no recollection beyond that , but I must have done all the things that must be done to cut oneself loose from an airplane , as complicated as cutting the umbilical cord that ties the baby to its mother . I have no recollection at all of stepping out through the bomb bay doors or of pulling the rip cord on my parachute because at that moment I had no desire to do it . My first recollection is of dropping down onto Italy , the rays of the late afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I were hung to a silken lantern , and it must have been this that caused me to glitter in Santa Vittoria , far to the south of me then , like a star or an omen in the evening . I was happy at that time , sometimes it seems to me like the happiest moment of my life and I do n't know why . At other times I see it as the saddest , because it cut me loose from myself , perhapsforever . I dropped out of the sun into the shadow of the mountains to the north of me , and it was cold , and the gold of the canopy turned to a whitish blue , and then I struck the terraced side of a mountain that was no longer farmed . The earth was hard , the earth was clay and rocks , and when I hit it I heard a bone snap in my leg and a little later I felt it . The cooling air of the late afternoon caught in my canopy and I began to be dragged down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some old vines and was held there by them . I pulled the parachute around me and made a nest for myself as a wounded animal would do . Later , in the night , I was wakened by some small dark men who smelled of manure and wine . They said nothing to me . They lifted me up and put me in a large basket that stank of earth and manure and grape mold and they put the basket on the back of a mule and took me back up the mountain I had landed on . I thought they were going to kill me , and I did n't care then . I was84in great pain . I was now a deserter . I was alone . Of all the AmericansI knew I had for some reason declared my personal end to the war and I was ashamed of myself . Who was I , to have attemptedsuch a thing ? The arrogance of my act overwhelmed me and I would close my eyes and soon as I did I would see the burning boy . As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to wonder why I wanted to die . They kept me in a little hut made of branches and twigs and straw , out in the middle of a field . I have no idea for how long . They fed me some kind of white runny goat cheese and hard bread and bitter olives and wine , and if it had n't been for the wine I think I would have starved to death . One night they came and got me and put me in the basket again and toward morning , when I could stand it no longer , I heard the clop of the mule 's hoofs on stone , and looking up from the basket I could see the roofs of houses and I knew I was in some sort of town . They dumped me here then , in the shredded old grape basket , in the Piazza of the People at the door of the Leaders ' Mansion . Italo Bombolini was mayor of the city , as I was to learn , and he had already been mayor for several weeks by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bombolini . The duty of the people is to tend to their own affairs .

Bombolini was a leader ; he was a born leader , he was a natural leader . He was , at times , an inspired leader . He was , in his own words , " sauce upon the pasta . " His leadership was so natural and he seized power with such grace that people who only several weeks before could not say his name without first prefacing it with " boob " or " fool " began to realize they had seen these traits of leadership in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he kept Giovanetti from killing his86wife by talking to him and getting the pick out of his hand ? I said to myself right then He may look like a clown , but here is the soul of the leader , ' I said . I can say this much : I was one of the first to recognize it . " Everyone had his own way of discovering Bombolini . In the end even Babbaluche was forced to admit that the wine seller possessed certain qualities that were surprising at least . " But they wo n't last , " the cobbler would say . " He 's running on nerve and luck alone . You watch . Somewhere inside that fat bastarda clown lives , and sooner or later the clown will come out , because a clown is a clown and will always be a clown . " There were others , some of the old men who no longer believed in anything on earth except hunger and work and finally death . " He 'll stop running , " they said  --  there is a saying here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when Bombolini continued to run even the old men began to turn on Babbaluche . " The ass is still running , " one of them shouted at the cobbler . " Maybe this ass is a horse . " " An ass is an ass and will always act like an ass , " Babbaluche said . " You wait . You 'll see his long ears goon enough . " * * *From his first day Bombolini seemed to have a feeling for the correct thing to do . The day after Vittorini had handed him the mayor 's medallion a group of citizens went across the piazza to the Leaders ' Mansion to ask Bombolini to surrender the office and put someone in it who would n't ruin the city . " All right , Italo , " they wanted to say to him , in all kindness , " the fun is over now ; we 've all had our good laugh . Now let 's settle down and get ourselves a leader . " But they did n't find Bombolini home that day . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went down to the terraces to tend their grapes Bombolini came out of hiding to tend to the town . He had the streets swept . He had the fountain repaired and the water-catch cleaned of all its mold and moss and all the old glass and potato peelings that washed around in it cleaned out and thrown away . The third morning , the people woke up and found87that all the old slogans in Santa Vittoria had been changed in the night .

It does n't really matter . The important point is that he did them . The trouble with government in this country is that it is composed of the Ins and the Outs . There are blacks and whites , but no grays here . When the Outs get in , they kick all the Ins out , and the new Outs do everything in their power to destroy the programsof the Ins , even when they might help them . It is brutal and sometimes bloody and almost always exciting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way it always has been . Bombolini 's genius , for that is what it must be seen as now , was that instead of throwing people out he invited everyone in . He formed the Grand Council of the Free City of Santa Vittoria and in two days every faction that could be counted upon to be fightingone another , every family and every force in the city , had a member in the government . Everyone was an In or had a member of the family who was an In . Membership in the Council was almost evenly divided among Frogs and Turtles and Goats . Half of the members were young , and half of them were old , and every one of the large or powerful families was represented . The real secret was , perhaps , that if not everyone was In because that was not possible , almost no one was Out . Giovanni Pietrosanto was made Minister of Public Waters , which meant that he was in charge of the fountain and the water tower . Under Giovanni 's direction the spillways were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Longo , and all the drains on the terraces were cleared and patched , and for the first time in twenty years there was water on the terraces for the grapevines . It is n't a great deal of water , but it is enough to keep a dry spell from becoming a drought , something that Someone greater than Bombolini had not seen fit to do . Under his brother Pietro , the other powerful member of the family , the organization called Minute Men of Santa Vittoria was formed . " Why do you want to waste your time on this ? " Fabio asked Bombolini . The mayor held up his hand . " ' The chief foundations of all89states are good laws and good arms . ' I have no say in the matter . The Master says we must have an army : ' At the start people laughed at the army , but as they drilled in the Piazza of the People after work and the twenty men got better at their drill , the people began to turn out to watch them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the drill was im- pressive . Every soldier was allowed to wear a red arm band on Sunday and to sport a hawk 's feather in his hat , and soon every young man in Santa Vittoria was hungry for a feather , but the army was held to twenty because that was the number of weapons we had . There were others . Commissioner of Sanitation , Master of the Scales , Minister for Bread and Pasta , Minister for Advanced Edu- cation , Minister for Affairs of the Aged . Ile closed the second meeting of the Grand Council with these words . " A wise man once said , The first impression one gets of a new ruler and his brains is from seeing the men he has chosen to have around him ! " He put down his hand . " Men of Santa Vittoria . By these standards I submit that I must be judged a genius . " At first they felt that Bombolini was being egotistical , but as they went home and the words rolled around in their heads and they began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , flattered . And as Bombolini had told Fabio , if you ca n't buy your way by money the next best way is to buy your way with flattery , because as every Italian knows , flattery will always get you somewhere . There were mistakes . One morning Bombolini decided to please the people by bringing democracy to the water fountain . For sev- eral hundred years , for reasons no longer known , several families had had the right to go to the head of the line waiting for water at the fountain and to fill their jugs first . One morning the women found this sign on the fountain . In The Eyes of God There Are No Preferred People . First Come , First Served . Order of Bombolini , Mayor The proclamations were now signed with one initial only in the manner of the Caesars . The experiment in democracy went well until Rosa Bombolini came across the piazza with her seven-90 gallon aluminum jug , modern and progressive , the only one of its kind in Santa Vittoria , and went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pietrosanto , as head of the army , was in charge of the new policy that morning . " Back , " he told her . " To the end of the line . You know the order . " " I know my rights , " she shouted . She pushed against Pictrosantowith her large and powerful chest . " You go tell him this . Tell him that no fat-ass Sicilian ragpicker is going to come up here and rob the rights of any Casamassima . " " There is nothing to do , " Bombolini told his general , " but to seize the offender 's water jug . " A seven-gallon water jug is a true weapon , especially when it is used unexpectedly . The head of the army went down in the Piazzaof the People exactly like a bull struck with a sledge hammer . Pietrosanto might have pressed charges . They might have taken her down the mountain to Montefalcone on the charge of intent to kill , but Pietrosanto 's pride would not bear it and Bombolini was not yet ready for such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sign was down and the old ways were restored , and this was the death of pure democracy in Santa Vittoria . That night Bombolini had Fabio copy in his book : " There is nothing more difficult to carry out and more doubtful of success than to initiate a new order of things . For the reformer has enemies in all those who prosper by the old order . " He was training Fabio to become mayor of the city when he would no longer be available . This , then , was the way things were going in Santa Vittoria for Italo Bombolini . The people had trust in him , and then as the summer went on the harvest began to look rich and strong . The grapes were plentiful and they were fat ; they had the look of healthy animals . When the grapes are good , things in Santa Vittoriaare good . If the failure of democracy at the fountain was his first error out of all the things that he did , I suppose it can be said that I was his second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down his government . I care to Santa Vittoria the same morning that he was forced to take down his sign at the fountain . THIS MUCH should be said at once . Although Fabio Bella Romagna , for a time at least , later came to hate me , if it had n't been for Fabio I would have died . The first people to find me in Santa Vittoria that morning assumed that I was dead . One of them felt my legs and when he felt their coldness , since the blood had run out of them hours before , he took my shoes . When they sent news of the body to Bombolini he agreed with the peo- ple that it should be taken at once , before the sun was fully up , and buried some place in the rock quarry under the stones . Born- bolini 's fear was that the crime , if that was what it was , would be reported to Montefalcone and then the police would come , and the freedom of the city would be endangered . He woke Fabio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Leaders to 92 see about taking me to the rock quarry , and he took one look at me in the grape basket and knew that I was alive . They are funny about the dead in Italy . They are fascinated with death , but not with the body that death leaves behind it . Sometimes the people are so anxious to get rid of the body that errors are made . Babbaluche , who made coffins when he was not cobbling , has stories about the men and women who came to life at the sound of earth raining down on the roof of what was to be their last home . The fingernails left behind in the soft wood of the boxes , Babbaluche says , are the monuments to these silent struggles . Instead of taking me to the quarry , they took me upstairs into the Mansion of the Leaders and put me in a bed . I have no idea of how long I stayed there . Three or four times a day the girl , Angela , came and held my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft sopping bread into my mouth , and sometimes she poured me a small glass of wine . I had no idea that I ever would get well , nor any hope that I would . I leaned toward death . The bone in my leg had joined together , but it had come together all wrong . I would lie on the bed for hours at a time in darkness and never make a move . When it was light in the piazza , I never knew whether it was because the sun was going down or coming up . After some time , a week or two weeks , I began to realize that , with no effort on my part or any consciousness of it , I was beginning to understand all the shouting and calling that I heard from downstairs and from the piazza . The language of my father and mother was returning to me . I had learned it as a small boy , but later , although it was spoken in the house , I had unlearned it . I would n't speak to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them unless they spoke to me in what we called American . I still dreamed at night about the boy , and the fat man or his daughter would have to come and restrain me while I would cry out and pound against the wall and hide beneath my blanket , which would go wet with sweat . But I knew that somewhere I had decided to try and live when one morning the girl was late coming with the broth and I was first hungry and then anxious and finally angry with her . And when she came , surrounded by allher smells , hot broth and good bread and strong soap and the freshness of herself , I found I was smiling . For some reason I was ashamed of myself for smiling , as if I had no right in the world to smile . I wanted to say good morning to her and to talk with her , but I was afraid to begin . During all of this time I had allowed no one to know that I knew the language . I knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from some village in this region , but I did n't even know the name of it . That 's the kind of son I had been to them . It made me ashamed , not telling them about the language . I was deceiving people who had risked themselves to aid me . I had had no bad intentions at the beginning , it was only that I was too tired and too uninterestedto want to speak , and also it was a simple form of selfdefense . The people would talk in front of me the way they talk in front of idiots and the deaf and small children . Only once did I come close to revealing myself . Bombolini and Fabio were in my room with some young men who wanted to look at me . Everyone in Santa Vittoria came to look at me at one time or another . There is very little to do here , and I was an object of curiosity . They felt my clothes , and some of them even rubbed their hands along my back or arms . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I never have found out . Whoever took them will keep them in the family until I am dead , for fifty years perhaps , and when I am gone they will come out into the open with them , probably at my own funeral . That is the way they are here . The young men were about to leave , I had bored them , when one of them looked down into the piazza from my window and said , " Oh my God , the Malatestas are back . " They all ran to the window and knelt down by it , since it is a low window and looked down into the piazza . The sound of their voices and the way they sucked in their breaths made me interested . " It 's the tall one , " one of them said , " the snotty one . What 's her name ? " None of them could remember at first . They all had a nickname for her , the Colt , Long Legs , the Icicle . Bombolini called her " the hawk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Caterina , " everyone said . " Yes . Caterina . " She was crossing the Piazza of the People toward the street that leads down from High Town and because she was wearing city shoes on the cobblestones she did n't walk the way the other women here walk . The women here walk as if they were carrying a burden . It is not unpleasant to watch . They move slowly , with a kind of slow graceful power to the walk , and the motion of their bodies is as much side to side as it is forward . Both were graceful , the women of the city and this Caterina Malatesta , but their graces were of different kinds . This is not meant to demean the women of Santa Vittoria , because some of them are very beautiful , but the difference was that between a work horse and a race horse . Each has its use in the world , and its beauty , but one was meant to be used and worked and one was meant to be admired and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they appeared to be heavy no one made any effort to help her with them , and she did n't ask for any . The women waiting in line at the fountain all saw her , but they gave no sign that they had seen her . I know little about clothes , but her clothes were of the kind that even a very ignorant person recognizes as the kind that cost money and are what is called high style . " The Germans must be giving them hell in Rome , " Bombolini said . " They only come back when they 're in trouble . " " They must have put her husband in jail . What was his name ? " No one knew . " They must have killed him , " someone said , and they all noddedand were silent for a moment . " Look at the way she walks . Zip zap zip . Like she 's saying go screw yourself . " " She 's a beast . She cuts the balls off men . She 's no good for anything . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starve to death , " they said about her . There is a saying here : What you ca n't have , abuse . And this is what they were doing , but I did n't know it then . " But she 's very beautiful , " I said , in Italian , and not one of them95noticed . She was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen . One morning I awoke and found that it was cool in the room , and when I leaned out of bed and looked across the piazza and over the houses to the mountains beyond I could see that they were covered with snow . Sometime in the night , unseen and unheardby us , a great storm , a battle between the heat of the south and the cold of the north , had been waged up there , and now in the morning rivers of white flowed down the mountainside . When Angela came in with the broth I said , " If you go to my window you 'll see something beautiful . " She put down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and that moment she looked very beautiful to me . I had not noticed that she also was beautiful in the way of simple things . " I do n't see anything , " she said . " On the mountains . There 's snow this morning . " " Ah , the new wind . " She turned back to me . " The new wind has blown summer away . It 's good for the grapes . " She spoke to me in dialect and was not at all surprised that I could answer her back or understand her . " Cool nights now and warm days , " she said . " It brings out the sugar in the grapes . " " Are n't you surprised at my talking ? " I asked . " We were wondering when you would begin to talk , " she said . " After all , you 've been here for weeks . " " But I talk rather well , do n't you think ? " She shrugged . " Little babies can speak at two years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she went downstairs and told them that I was now talking and while there was no surprise about the miracle of my tongue there was interest and even excitement , because now they could do business with me . Bombolini , followed by some other members of the Grand Council , came running up the stairs to my room . " They say you talk very well , " he said to me . " Good . " He seized my hand and pumped it violently . He turned to the others . " What did I tell you ? What did I say about him ? " He shook my hand again so violently that it caused my leg to ache . " This is a verysuperior person . This is someone very special . We are in the pres- ence of a superior human being . " He squeezed my hand and he went downstairs without ever hearing me say a word in dialect or in Italian . Of all the people that I could hear downstairs only Fabio did not seem to be impressed by my language . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told people . He told anyone who would listen about an idiot they hired at the Academy to clean chamber pots who had learned German in one month . " You see , " Fabio told them , " the ability to learn languages in this way is in some cases actually a sign of idiocy . " No one understood what Fabio was trying to tell them , and neither did I then . " Why do you keep telling us this ? " Bombolini asked him . " You sound as if you have something against the man . " " I have nothing against him , " Fabio said . " I only want to correct the record , to put things in the proper perspective . Learning a language this way is no sign of intelligence . " " But that 's just it , " Bombolini said . " I expected him to learn the language . You can see he 's brilliant . It sticks out all over him . " What despair I caused Fabio in those days , and I should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen to me speak on the first day , nothing could seem to stop him from coming back on the days that followed and I became sorry I had ever opened my mouth in the first place . He came in the afternoons when I was asleep and at night , and he stayed until I fell asleep in his face , asking me questions about how they did things in America , about the government and the setup of the states and the ruling of towns and the conduct of the police and the courts and the making of laws and the collecting of revenues  --  until I came to dread the sound of his step on the stairs . More than the intrusion and the effort involved was my shame at my ignorance . " I do n't know about that , " I would say . " I ca n't answer that . I never studied it , I never found out about it . " " It 's a wise man who can say I do n't know , " ' Bombolini would say . " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall in embarrassment . " It is only the wise ones who know the extent of their knowl-edge . " The few answers I was able to give him he speared the way a beggar spears chunks of meat in his soup . He fished them out before they could get away from him and then he rolled them around in his mouth , savoring them , before finally swallowing them . " Brilliant , " he would say . " These are brilliant things you tell me . It came so that I could n't bear the sight of Fabio 's face at such times . It was Fabio , however , who was finally able to figure out why Bombolini acted that way toward me . Ile had already figuredout the reason for Bombolini 's amazing success at governmentthat had changed him from a clown to a prince in one night . What Fabio found was that Bombolini was no longer Bombolini at all but someone else who had lived five hundred years before him . When faced with any problem or any decision , Bombolini would not become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and The Discourses and have Niccold Machiavelli provide him with the proper answer . It was from these books and this man that he drew his wisdom and his assurance and his poise and his strength . Bombolini was only a face and a body and a mouth for The Master . All of the answers were n't in the hooks , of course , but the important thing was that Bombolini felt they were and , believing that , he had no fear and suffered no qualms . But somewhere along the line there were problems that even The Master could n't provide answers for , and it was for this reason , and for no love of me , that Bombolini turned out to be such a formidable fighter in my behalf when the affair of Babbaluchethe cobbler and Abruzzi the American threatened to tear the Free City of Santa Vittoria apart and bring down its government . Life has changed little here since the days when Machiavelli went sourly through the streets of Florence , and yet some things have changed and it was these gaps in the Master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed a representative of the New Ways , someone forged in the fire of the New98Culture , as Fabio says he put it . And who better than me , a dropper-in from the New World ? For the purposes of Italo Bornbolini , for his well-being and his assurance , it was essential that I prove to be brilliant and he made certain that I was . As soon as I was able to stand with the aid of a crutch the cobbler had made for me I was invited downstairs to sit in on sessions of the governmentand after a week I was invited to join the Grand Council as a full member , as a minister without portfolio , to advise on currentaffairs . I used to wonder what they would think in Benjamin Franklin High School , which I left when I was a junior , if they could see me sitting in the Grand Council as Minister Without Portfolio . This was the state of things when Babbaluche came up onto the terrace of the Mansion of the Leaders one night during a meeting of the Grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began pointing his finger at me . " Look at this son of a bitch , " he said . " Feast your eyes on him . " They looked at me and I think I blushed , because I had always felt like a fraud at the meetings in the first place . I felt naked before them . " Because of this son of a bitch each one of you stands to go to jail and to lose your vines . " It was the loss of the vines that struck fear in their hearts . " Do you know who this bastard is ? Do you know what he rep-resents ? " I felt they had discovered that I had been a deserter , and I looked down , which did n't help my image before the people . " This son of a bitch is an enemy of the state . " " He seemed like a good man to me , " Giovanni Pietrosanto said . " That 's all that I know . " " An enemy of the state . " The argument was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergence of the Badoglio government , America was still at war with Italy , and by making me a member of the Grand Council each member was guilty of treason and infamous acts by collaborating with the enemy . " You are collaborators , " Babbaluche told them . " Do you know what they do to collaborators ? " 99Everyone knew what they did . They took away your home and they impounded your land and they tore up your vines by the roots . " And even worse , you are guilty of consorting . " No one knew the penalty for consorting , but if that was worse than collaborating , no one needed to know . It would have been understandable for Bombolini to have deserted me then , and I have no doubt that lie would have clone so if his need for me had not been greater than the risk of being caught consorting . He could have put me in a cart and taken me to Montefalcone and turned me over to the authorities . It would have ended his troublesand even earned him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They sent me from the room and I soon fell asleep , so I never heard the debate . The debate raged on during the night , and I understand that it was bitter , because no one has ever volunteered to tell me anything about it . Sometime early in the morning it finally became a question of confidence in the government and its leader . The issue was whether to turn me over and be safe or to keep me and run the risk of losing their vines and even their lives . Who could have trust in a government that had any doubt about which course to take ? At dawn Babbaluche rose and began to read from a paper on which he had been writing . Resolved , That the people of the glorious Free City of Santa Vittoria , having lost all confidence in the ability of the leader Bombolini any longer to lead . . . They voted after this and no one has ever told me the count , so it must have been close . No one likes to tell me how close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to Montefalcone . But whatever the count was , Italo Bombolini managed to do what Benito Mussolini failed to manage . I have heard that there was not much honor in the victory . All kinds of things were promised in return for all kinds of votes . I have heard , for example , that I was described as a rich young man who might come back someday and in thankfulness endow the city with such things as schools and fire departments . But perhaps that is n't true ; to this day I do n't know . None of it has ever botheredBombolini , because he had done the one thing all Italians learn to do above all other things : he had endured . Why did Babbaluche bring the charge , he who hated the Germansand the Fascists above all the rest of us ? It was , as Vittorini later told me , a curse of the nation and a curse of the blood . It is in Babbaluche 's nature to embarrass and destroy governments . The nation is filled with people like him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their only business and their only true passion . " They are the flies in the soup of state , " Vittorini told me . " They are not very large but they must be taken out or they will ruin the entire bowl of soup . " For show they put me under house arrest and they sent notice of my presence to Montefalcone by way of Fungo , an idiot here , who would make certain to lose the message and lie that he had delivered it to the carabinieri . They took away my membership in the Grand Council and I became an ex-minister without anything . There was never a serious challenge to Bombolini after that . I was his low mark but he had survived , and in surviving he strengthened himself . That next day , in a show of strength , he had himself named Captain of the People instead of Mayor , an old and honored title in this region , and after a time even Babbaluche came to call him Captain . The Discourses of Italo BomboliniAnyone can be great with money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obligation . The trick is to be great without money. - ITALO BOMBOLINIAnyone can make an omelet with eggs . It takes a great man to make one with none.  --  A saying of Santa Vittoriar HOSE MONTHS , the summer in Santa Vittoria , were good . There was hunger in Italy but there was no hunger here . There were shortages in everything but there was no true hunger . There was still good wine to trade and sell . Most of the wine here is vermouth , which is a blend of wines and aromatic herbs , and the vermouth we make is good . It is not boasting to say this or lying to say it . This is a history and it is a simple and recognizedfact that the wine made in Santa Vittoria is one of the best in the world . The vermouth is aged for a year or even two years , depending on the amount of sugar in the grapes and the amount of acid , on the time of month the grapes were picked , the position of the moon during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ears of Old Vines , who alone here can hear them . Usually most of this wine is sold to the Cinzano family , who sell it all over the world , but because of the war the wine was still in Santa Vittoria . When we needed food three or four carts were loaded with wine from the Cooperative Wine Cellar and sent to Montefalcone , where there was always a market for our wine . The carts would come back up the mountain the next day filled with flour for bread and pasta , with bags of onions and salt and peppers , green peppers and red peppers , with tins of sardines and mackerel from Sicily , with balls of cheese and wheels of cheese , whole carts filled with artichokes , sometimes boxes of cherries and baskets of fruit from the north , dry pork sausage , salami , black olives and green olives , cheap black wine in big wicker baskets , since our own wine is too good to drink every day  --  one basket of ours for three of theirs  --  baskets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil to splash on our bread . When the carts came hack up the mountain you would not know there was a war on in Italy . But something was happening in Italy . The feeling could even be felt up on the mountain . There had been a time when two or three trucks in a morning was considered to be traffic on the Montefalcone road , but now the sound of trucks and half-tracks and even tanks could be heard from the River Road all day long and far into the night . " You should see what 's happening in Montefalcone , " the men who went to get the food would tell the others . " There are more tanks in there than there are people . There are more Germans than our own people . " We felt it , but it did n't concern us . There was food and the weather was good and the grapes were fattening on the vines like pregnant women . The people in Santa Vittoria looked up at the sky as a source of danger , for the signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more than they looked down at the road to Montefalcone . If the Italian nation was in danger of coming apart , the city of Santa Vittoria had never felt closer together . And for this , Italo Bombolini must take all of the credit . He had embarked the city on a program for greatness . Beside his bed in the Leaders ' Mansionhe had hung this sign : 103Nothing causes a prince to be so much esteemed as great enterprises and giving proof of prowess . It keeps the people 's minds uncertain and astonished and it keeps them occupied in watching their result . The mayor 's problem , as he put it , was how to conduct great enterprises in a city where people trail oxen with a broom and pan in hopes of getting a free surprise . How do you uncover greatness in a city so poor that a man will provoke another man into an argument just so that his donkey can be eating the other man 's grass while they argue ? IIow do you give proof of prowess in a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning waiting for a pear on a pri- vate tree to be blown off by a wind and dropped into the street , thereby becoming public property ? IIow do you accomplish anything at all when the city treasury is so bare that the addition of one coin to the vault would double the contents ? Bombolini began by changing the names of all of the streets . There were public hearings , there were contests among the chil- dren and the young and the old of the town , there were votes and re-votes , speeches and arguments , until the city was in a state of civic uproar and excitement . In the end the Piazza Mussolini became the Piazza Matteotti , named for the first famous victim of the Fascist regime . It was a very popular decision . We were surprised to find after the war that five hundred other Italian towns had done the same thing . The Corso Mussolini became the Corso Cavour , because it sounded good and every town must have something named after Cavour . Then came the whole rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as the names of the Risorgi- memo are recalled . Streets were named for Mazzini , for Gari- baldi , for the Redshirts . One street was even named for Vittorio Emmanuele , and when no one was sure exactly which number was the good Vittorio the number was left off and now stands for any Vittorio Emmanuele you may desire . The Street of D'Annunzio the Poet posed a problem , since no one , not even Fabio , knew of another poet to match D'Annunzio . " What is the greatest book in Italy ? " Bombolini asked Fabio . " I Promessi Sposi , " Fabio said . " Are you sure of that ? I have never heard of it . " " There is no question about it . " " Who wrote it then ? " Bombolini said , and Fabio turned scarlet . The name escaped him and to save him further embarrassment the street was named Street of the Author of I Promessi Sposi , although the people still called it Goat Alley , as they always had done . The effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but had brought the people closer together . Perhaps the only saddened person was Bombolini himself . When the last of the streets and piazzas and lanes was named and there were no more left , Fabio found Bombolini sitting in the darkness of the large room in the Leaders ' Mansion , which that morning had been renamed the Palace of the People . " The people have entertained the vice of ingratitude , " he told Fabio . I was coming down the stairs on my crutches . " Never trust the people about anything , " he shouted to me . " They 'll show you the fangs of forgetfulness . " It was embarrassing to both of us , and we attempted to look away from the Captain without seeming to look away . " Look at them out there , walking about , enjoying themselves . Do you know why ? Because I carry their burdens for them , that 's why . Ingratitude . " He slammed the door shut and the room was dark again . " Do you know what ingratitude is ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet waters of life into a pinningshit pot . The sons of bitches . " They could hear him pull back a chair and sit at the table . " They did n't even name an arch after me . " We were glad we could n't see him , because both of us felt he was beginning to cry . In the morning it was as if nothing had taken place . He was as bright as the sun . It is said somewhere that the art of art is to make the work seem artless and this is what Captain Bombolini did with Santa Vittoria . With the exception of Fabio and occasionallymyself , no one had any idea at all of the work and thought that went into the things that he did and how much of himself was in them . " Fabio , " he said . " Go and get your notebook . You are going to see a man make an omelet without any eggs and I want you to see how it is done . " * * *It was Fabio who saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for getting Caterina Malatesta to repair the bone in my leg . 1 did n't understand it at the time , but lie wanted my leg made well so that I could go away from Santa Vittoria . " You 're a soldier and a soldier must make every effort to rejoin his own men so that he can continue the fight , " Fahio told me . I nodded . Fabio was not the person he had been before . Even I , a stranger , could notice it . He was moody and then sullen and finally openly angry almost all of the time , and he had begun to drink too much wine . In truth , Fabio was drunk a good deal of the time . Everyone said it was the books . They begged hirn to give up the books because clearly his mind had been pushed to the breaking point . We did n't know it then , or for a long time afterward , that it was the sight of Angela Bombolini feeding me broth and the sound of Angela Bombolini talking to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Palace that was destroying Fabio before us . Bombolini himself had gone up to High Town to see the Malatesta , as they called her , and she had laughed in his face . Even after that , as shy as he was , Fabio went to see her , and for reasons we do n't know the Malatesta agreed to come and see me . It is a measure of how desperate Fabio must have been . She was not a doctor in the sense that she had a license to practice in Italy , but she had gone to medical school in Rome until the final year , when her father , to save the family , forced her to leave school and marry a very rich young Roman , of a noble and influentialfamily , who was a rising Fascist and a friend of Count Galeazzo Ciano. io6 107Her family had once been a great family in this region . Once they held large holdings of land , but they began to lose it , plot after plot , in all the ways a family destined for disaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love for the land , and worse , no greed for it , and no one can hold onto land around here without it . There are too many who want it too much . At the time of the marriage they were reduced to a few parcels of land and several houses in the region , one of which was in High Town and which various Malatestas retreated to from time to time to lick their wounds . When they would leave they would leave the house an unspeakable mess . The Malatestas did n't seem to know how to live any longer . No one knew how the marriage came out . There is a picture of the rich husband in the Malatesta house , but it is assumed by all that he died when Mussolini was ousted . The face in the frame is one of those faces that it takes one thousand years of privilege and money to breed . When she came into my room she never really saw me . She took off the smelly bandages that Dr. Bara had put on the wound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on the floor . I was ashamed of my wound because it stank and I began to apologize for it to her . That is the effect she has on people . She did n't hear me . " This wound will have to be opened , " she told me . " The infectionwill have to be cleared up and the bone will have to be rebrokenand set again . " " If you say that it has to be done . " " It does n't have to be done . If you want a leg it will have to be done . " " I want a leg . " " It will hurt a great deal . " " It hurts a good deal now . " " It will hurt a great deal . " I shrugged and she smiled at me , which confused me . " You do n't know the pain I am talking about . I ca n't take you to the hospital , you understand . " " I understand that . " " Americans are n't prepared for pain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " The people here know different . They know that pain is the natural condition of life . " I did n't understand why she was telling me these things . Angela had come into the room and although the Malatesta was consciousthat she was there she gave no sign of it until , without looking at her either , she ordered Angela to pick up my filthy bandages . " " Yes , signorina . " " Signora . " " Yes , signora , " Angela said , and to my astonishment she made a small curtsy . " I will come for you when I am ready , " the Malatesta told me . " Ca n't you give me some idea , to prepare myself ? " " When I 'm ready I 'll come , " she said . " What are you going to do when they come ? " " When who come ? " " The Germans . " " I do n't know yet , " I told her . " People say they wo n't come here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . " She laughed at me . At the door she turned to Angela , although she still did n't seem to see her . " You come to my house after you clean up here . I have some work for you , " the Malatesta told her . " Yes , signora . " " She made a curtsy again . When the Malatesta was gone I was embarrassed for Angela . " You would n't go up there , " I said . " Not after the way she treated you . " It was Angela 's turn to be surprised . " Of course I 'll go . We like to go . We charge her three times too much . " " But the way she talked to you . " I could see that Angela did n't understand what I was talking about . I could see what I should have been able to understand myself  --  how much a luxury pride and honor can be . It helps to be well-fed enough to nourish them both . And I should have been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he needsio8two things here  --  a sharp mind and thick soles . The truth is that no peasant has ever died of a broken heart . " Oh , yes , " Angela said , picking up my bandages . The sight and smell of my own bandages made me turn away . " We milk her well . " The Malatesta was a hawk but if there was a pigeon in the room , I began to understand who it was . The Malatesta came back several days later , with no warning . She came with some local anesthetic and a bottle of grappa with Fabio as a helper , and a half hour after she arrived she cracked the bone in my leg . There was , as she had promised there would be , a moment of " superior " pain ( it pleases me to this day to think that she was impressed when I did n't cry out ) , and she began to reset the bone . During all of that time she never said one word to me to make me feel like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a human being . At the end of it she said , " You lie in bed for one week and then you get up and try and walk . The sooner you walk on this the better it will be for you . " She went to the door of the room and turned and looked out the low window into the piazza . " But I doubt that you will do it , " she said . It was this , of course , that sent me stumbling out into the Piazza of the People , my face stiff with pain and running with a cold sweat , exactly one week after the Malatesta had come into the room with her grappa and her rubber hammer . The more I walked the stronger the leg would become . It had withered until it looked like the leg of an old man , and I began to go down through the streets and finally all the way to the wall and the Fat Gate and down onto the terraces . The people liked me down there . I gave them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the strongest feeling that I had been in all of these places before , in the town and on the terraces . I seemed to know everything in advance , and there were no surprisesfor me . I think now it must have been caused by all the images left in my mind , even when I was n't listening to them , by the talk of all the people from " the other side , " from " the old country , " who sat around the table in my mother 's kitchen drinkingcoffee and wine and anisette and telling about the old days and how their children were falling to pieces in America. 109In the end I would make it a point to go all the way down the mountain to the foot of the terraces and then to rest in the enormousancient wine cellar at the base of the mountain before forcingmyself to climb up again . This was one thing that was different . I had never seen anything like the cellar before , and I came to love it for its coolness and quiet . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Middle Ages it had been rebuilt entirely and so it was n't the goal for tourists that it might otherwise have been . It had finally been abandoned in the eighteenth century . There were two cellars actually , and one day this was to mean a great deal to Santa Vittoria . There was a small opening in the mountainside which led into an enormous room , hollowed out of the mountain itself , which was called the Great Room . It was as large as the inside of a cathedral , and I have no idea why they ever built such a room , unless in Roman times it had been used as a temple to some god of wine . From the back wall of the Great Room two long , deep wine cellars were cut into the bowels of the mountain . I did n't go into the cellars themselves , because they were humid and I could sense that they were filled with water , but the Great Room was cool by the entrance and I would lie on the dry sand and take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was the only person in Santa Vittoria who ever went into the old wine cellar . They were afraid of the spirits who lived in there . Everyone in Santa Vittoria has some story about some member of his family who strayed into the tunnel in a sudden storm and the terrible things that happened to them in there . They feared for my life , but when nothing happened to me it did n't lessen their belief in the evil spirits but only convinced them that Italian spirits and ghosts were not interested in nonItalianpeople . During the week that I had spent in bed before walking I had worked on the radio of Vittorini , the mail clerk . They had brought it to me to fix because I was an American and Americans are supposedto be able to fix new inventions such as radios . I knew nothing about radios , but there is a certain logic about anything that is broken . Sooner or later there has to be something that is n't connected , and if it can be connected , as with my leg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I finally got it to work . In those days we received an hour of electricity a day from the power station at San Rocco del Lago . Some days it never came at all . But on one day when it did come I heard a broadcast from Egypt that was sent to Italy by the English . The Americans , they said , were almost all the way across Sicily and the invasion of the mainland was to be expected any day . I grew very excited about that , and I shouted out the news before I realized that the last thing I wished then was to be liberated . But it did n't matter in any case . Fabio had no interest , and Bombolini , even though he was from Sicily , listened to me without really understanding the words . He was far too interested in cooking his eggless omelet. 111HE OMELET Bombolini was preparing was intended to feed the entire city , and he succeeded in doing it . He gave the people great enterprises and proofs of prowess , and he kept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a cost of nothing . The patron saint of this place is not Santa Vittoria , as you would have a right to expect . No one even knows who Santa Vittoria is , although it is thought that she is a corruption of some earlier pagan god who had to do with the wine . But the patron saint here , as our luck would have it , does not deal with the grape and has no special power or prayers to pressure God and make Him look after the vines or the rains or the condition of the soil . The patron saint here is Santa Maria of the Burning Oven , a local112peasant girl who did the kinds of things that saints do to get themselves canonized and who was then thrust upon this city . For example , once a baker here , while pulling out his loaves , fell headlong into his ovens . His screams could be heard all over the city , but there was nothing anyone could do for him except to hope that he did n't ruin the day 's bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blazing oven and picked up the baker and carried him into the street . Neither suffered a burn , and the bread that night was said to be the best ever baked in the city . Another time , some pilgrims were passing through the city on their way to Siena . They had been caught in a snowstorm and were starving . There was nothing in the city to feed them  --  not that many would have parted with their pasta for the pilgrims  --  except a crust of bread , and they were sure they were going to die . " You mock us . What good is this crust of bread ? " the leader said to Maria . " Eat of it , " the girl told them . They ate , and as the leader cut into the little crust at each cut a fresh slice of bread leaped onto the blade of the knife . They ate until they were fat with bread . It was said by all to be the best they had ever tasted . One night the same baker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread shovel in the oven . When Maria rescued the shovel from the oven it was only a charred crisp . " Flow can I work without a bread shovel ? " the baker asked . " Weep not and God will find a way , " the girl said . In the morning the shovel had been restored . New wood had grown where the old wood had been burned , and it is said that green leaves actually sprouted from the handle . Many here believethe shovel was certainly a part of the wood from the True Cross . Bombolini 's plan , as simple as possible , was to turn Santa Vittoriainto a national and then an international shrine for all the bakers of the world . Bakers from all over the world , who lacked a saint of their own , would want to come and pay homage to the Little Saint of the Bread Oven , as Bombolini began to call her . What novice baker would wish to begin a career without first113coming to Santa Vittoria and spending a few days , a novena perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God through Santa Maria to favor him so that he might make money in his new career ? Old bakers would want to come and give thanks for their success . Bakers who were in trouble and going broke would want to come and get God and Santa Maria on their side for a change . The idea of Santa Vittoria as a national shrine became a craze here . It was all that anyone talked about . If a shrine was proclaimed , a road would have to be built up the mountain to accommodate the pilgrims ; and if there was a road , there would be taxis and maybe even a bus . The pilgrims would need places to stay and places to cat . Every home was a potential inn , every woman a potential cook , every vine pruner a potential waiter going around in white jackets and soft shoes collecting tips for doing next to nothing . A cooperative bakery turning out bread from the Shrine of Blessed I3rcad ( each loaf personally blessed by Polenta for a fee ) could be started , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such things as little wooden bread shovels and clay ovens and satin pillows with pictures of Santa Maria on them and wooden plaques that read Santa Maria of the Burning Oven , bless this humble bakery . It was felt by some that within ten years ' time only a fool would ever have to go down to work on the terraces again . Most leaders would have stopped there , but Bombolini knew things most leaders never learn . There is a dark side to man that needs a way out as well as the good side . The Master had written . " Hatred is gained as much by good works as by evil . " As they say , if there is no acid in the grape the wine is tasteless and finally useless . " The wise prince , " Bombolini told Fabio , with his finger in the air , " must foment some enmity so that by suppressing it he will augment his greatness . " It was this that led him to declare war on Scarafaggio and which also led to Fabio 's leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word and you can picture the town . There is no beauty to it . It sits across the valley on the other mountain , a feeble imitation of Santa Vittoria . It huddles over there like a sheep dog whose master beats her ; it cowers there , filled with fleas and ticks and roaches . We have bedbugs114here , but they only survive here ; in Scarafaggio they flourish . The people of Scarafaggio are known as the greatest fools in Italy , which is no easy title to claim . One example must suffice . Fifty years ago they found that their church was too small and since , of course , no one in the town was capable of enlarging it they were forced to go outside and ask bids for the work . No one would go there , of course , but finally they found a man who said he would stretch their church for them , and since his fee was so small they were willing to believe him . He told everyone to go to bed , that his magic must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went in the church and locked the door and sometime in the night he took out the last pew of the church by the back wall and threw it over the wall , down into the bushes . After this he took strong raw soap and he soaped all of the floor along by the back wall where the pew had once stood . In the morning twenty of the strongest men in Scarafaggio were blindfolded , since the magic must be done in secret , and they were led into the church and placed against the wall , facing it , with their hands on the stones . " Now push , " the stranger ordered . " Push . Push . Push . " And it was incredible . They pushed and they felt the wall move away from them . They pushed and pushed until the last of them was face down on the ground . " Now take off your blindfolds . " When they did they could see that it was true . A miracle had been passed . They got up and ran down into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried . The church had been stretched . The back wall was now a full five feet away from the back pew and there was room for another row of pews and more . The people were pleased with their new church . " You could hardly tell it was stretched , " they said . They were so pleased with the results that they paid the church stretcher exactly half of what they had said they would pay him , which was considerably more than they had planned to pay , and to this day it remains a mystery in Scarafaggio as to how the newer , bigger church with the added pew holds exactly the same number of souls as the old one . In the first week in September that year Bombolini called a115meeting of all the people in the Piazza of the People on a Sunday , and he asked the people to look out over the valley at Scarafaggio . " They 're laughing at us over there , " he told the people . This was astonishing news . " For two hundred years they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . " It was hard to believe . Ile allowed them a few minutes to study the miserableness heaped up across the valley , and then the bell in our tower rang out . " Do you hear that ? " Captain Bombolini asked them . Everyone nodded , and then he pointed across the valley . " Well so do they . " Ile allowed them to think about this . " They get up by our bell . They go out by our bell . They go to Mass by our bell . " The people were astounded by this . It had never occurred to any of them before . " We pay for the bell and they use the sound . While someone here sweats to make it ring they lie in their beds and listen to it sing . They lie in their beds and they laugh . " If the best thing in the world is to get something for nothing it follows that the worst is to give away something and get nothing back for it . " It is as simple as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stealing our sound . " The people were violent about it . Pietrosanto , for example , was all for calling out the Santa Vittoria army and marching on Scarafaggio . It became a little foolish after that , and everyone today is willing to admit it . But at the moment there seemed nothing foolishabout it . " Take down the bell , " someone shouted , and that seemed like a very good solution . " Better no bell than to give away our sound . " There was a roar of approval . " Keep the bell , but cut the rope so no one can ring it , " another man shouted . That made even more sense . To his credit , Bombolini was able to restrain the excited people . He pointed to the new sign at the end of the piazza . " Remember . The three true virtues of the Italian people . Tranquillity . Calmness . Patience . Restrain yourselves . Your captain has a plan for you . The old wrong will be righted . " So the city was excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be , were astounded . That Sunday night three men left Santa Vittoria with a mule and a donkey and some of the old Etruscan vases from the room in the Palace of the People that had once served as a museum , and everyone knew it had to do with the Solution . Only Fabio , to whom Bombolini had already told the solution , was unexcited . " If you go through with this I leave Santa Vittoria , " Fabio said . " I resign from the Grand Council . I return to Montefalcone where I belong . " Bombolini was hurt by this , because Fabio , in a way , is the conscience of Santa Vittoria . " It 's an evil thing , " Fabio said . " You know it is . It appeals to the people 's worst instincts . " " That 's not such a bad instinct , Fabio , to want what is yours . " " It 's a rotten instinct and you know it . " " You forget one thing , Fabio . The people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human beings . They are only Christians , not Christs " Fabio put on his hat to show that he was leaving . " You have no right to sell the Etruscan vases . They belong to the people . To all of us . " " No one ever looked at them , you know that . They sat in there covered with dust . You could n't even carry water in them . " " The vases , " Fabio said , with elaborate disgust , " happen to be two thousand years old . " " And what good is a vase if it ca n't carry water ? " The look of pain on Fabio 's face was genuine . " You hurt me deeply , " Bombolini said . " You make me feel like some kind of evil person . " " If they come back up this mountain with that thing , I go , " Fabio said , and he left . It was not known at the time , no one could understand Fabio 's ways then , but he wanted an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self , his own broken heart , and he had found it . If anyone should have been able to see it , it was myself ; but I was young then and did n't wish to see things like that . The men who had left Santa Vittoria with the donkey and the mule came back to the city early one evening a few days after117they had left . The Etruscan vases were gone , but on the back of the mule was a large package wrapped in old sheets and tied around with grapevine . The people went down into the streets to see them come . They tried to touch the package , but the men pushed them away . Fabio came to see me in my room . " All right , " he told me . " I 'm leaving . You can have her now . She is all yours . " I told him I did n't know what he was talking about . In a way I did n't , and yet in a way I knew what he meant . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never seen him angry in this way before . Ile was cold and lie seemed at once years older than before and years older than myself because he had suffered . If I had fought with Fabio then , it would have been the sort of fight that could not have stopped until one of us was dead or close to death . " She eats you up with her eyes , " he said . " She devours you . She falls all over you . " " I never asked her to . " " Oh , no . You lie there and lead her on , because you Americans do n't have manners as we do . You take advantage . " He was suddenlyvery generous toward me . " It 's all right . I would do the same thing . Do I hate you for it ? I envy you . It 's nothing . I was simply born in the wrong place . " I was thankful that it was dark in my room and he could n't see my face then . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angela , although something seemed to take place between us when we played them . " Why do you think an American would n't marry you ? " I would say to Angela . " Oh , Americans do n't go for girls like me . They want rich girls . " " It helps . But they like pretty girls , too . " " Then I 'm not pretty enough . " " Maybe not , " I would say . " Then again . Stand up there by the window and let me see you . " She was so simple and so sweet and of course she would stand by the window . " Americans want women like the Malatesta . " " Oh , all men want women like the Malatesta . But if you can'tzz8get the MaIatesta you have to get someone else . Someone like .. . someone like . . . " And she would turn scarlet . I did n't know then that men and women did n't talk to each other this way in Santa Vittoria unless they were going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other in the same room or that many of them never touched one another until the date of their wedding was announced . " She never sees me , " Fabio said . " She has forgotten my name . I 'll tell you what she has done . " He was close to shouting at me by then . " For two weeks she has failed to bring me my plate of beans . " He went to his own room to pack his things. * * *The men with the package unwrapped it that night and did what work they had to do so that it was ready for Sunday morning . On that morning Fabio della Romagna left the city for Montefalcone . He did not take his bicycle , because it was dangerous to be on the roads with a bike without a pass from the Germansor without a good reason . The few things he took were in a small , crude knapsack on his back . He reached the bottom of the mountain and was crossing the flat fields toward the River Road that leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vittoria came running toward him . " Fabio , " one of them shouted at him . " Fabio , Fabio , Fabio. it 's marvelous . Look . " He turned Fabio around so that he was looking back up the mountain at the city . Someone on the Fat Wall was waving what appeared to be Vittorini 's flag . " You see ? You understand , Fabio ? " the man said to him . " That means it 's ringing and we ca n't hear a thing . " " Nothing ? " " Not a Goddamn thing , " a third man said . " You should have seen them in Scarafaggio , Fabio . Their jaws hanging open . What happened to the bell ? ' they ask . What 's the matter with the bell ? ' " " And not a sound , Fabio , " the first one said again . " The greatest moment in the history of the city of Santa Vittoria . " None of them understood when Fabio broke loose and began to119trot and then ran to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vittoria to tell the people that it truly worked and to describe the silence over Scarafaggio . In the Piazza of the People they did n't wait for the men from Scarafaggio before beginning to celebrate . It was clear from the first ringing of the bell that it was a success . One of the Pietrosantos , whose back muscles could be seen through the shirt he was wearing , was in the campanile pulling the rope . They heard the old creak as the bell began to swing , but what they heard after that was something they had never heard before . The clapper met the bronze bell and there was a low muffled sound , not the good clear bong of before . It was the sound of-a bell , but just barely . The people looked at one another and they began to smile and as the muffled sound went on they began to laugh out loud and finally to hit each other on the back while tears began to run down from their eyes . The first of the runners came up from Old Town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bell down there and up there , they reported , but only just barely . The sound ended at the town walls . It was recognized for what it was , an act of inspiration , even an act of genius . The members of the Grand Council lined up in the piazza to take Captain Bombolini 's hand , and soon a good part of the city was in the line . After shaking his hand they went up the steep winding stairs to the top of the bell tower itself to feel the clapper . Cork ! A cork clapper . There could be no doubt about it . It was an act of inspiration , an act of genius . The Grand Council authorized some young men to go down to the Cooperative Wine Cellar and withdraw two hundred bottles of wine , and the celebration for the cork clapper began . This much can be put down , not as a guess but as a fact . In all of the history of Santa Vittoria , in a thousand years at least , the people had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leadership in more capable hands. 3 VON PRUM1200 N THAT SAME NIGHT , the night of the cork clapper , Captain Sepp von Prum , of the Financial Affairs Division of the Headquarters Staff of the Fifth Panzer Brigade , with headquarters in Montefalcone , was finishing the last of his letters . Every Sunday afternoon and every Sunday evening he devoted to doing his letters . He signed the last of them , and since it was not late he decided to take them down to the Piazza Frossimbone and have them stamped as censored by Colonel Scheer , his commanding officer . He wrote a good letter . He was conscious of that , and unlike a lot of other junior officers he did not mind having the letters censored . When the colonel merely glanced at them and stamped them " censored " he was sometimes disappointed . He went down the narrow stone stairs of the house in which he123was billeted more swiftly than he usually did and it caused him pain , since he was still recovering from wounds he had received the year before . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some serious fashion in North Africa or in Russia . Despite the pain , he continued to walk swiftly down the street of San Stefano into the piazza . There had been a rumor that the Americans and the English had made a landing somewheresouth of Rome that morning and that the Italians not only had withdrawn from the war but were about to declare themselves in a state of war with Germany . At eight o'clock the news would come from the English in Cairo , and lie wanted to be with the other officers when Colonel Scheer turned it on . It is a fortunate thing for us that the letters of Captain von Prum have been preserved in the archives of Santa Vittoria , which actually is nothing more than the battered old gray file cabinet that von Prum was forced to leave behind when he left Santa Vittoria . It is a fortunate thing that he made and preserved copies of everything he wrote , military records , entries in his diary and log , letters to his brother who was serving on the eastern front in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mollendorf , which were filed under the heading " Love Interest . " From the letters we were able to obtain a picture of the captain that might always have puzzled us here if we had not been able to have them translated and read to us . It does n't seem out of place to print parts of several of the letters the captain wrote that day . From the notes to his brother Klaus , we have been able to figureout that during an action along the Dnieper Bend several of Klaus 's soldiers broke and ran in the face of Russian tanks , although they later returned to the field of battle . Despite this , the young men were shot , as an example to the others ; and the officer who had reported them , Klaus von Prum , was badly shaken by the action .

Actually we have little to do with finances . We spend most of our time cataloguing the assets of the area , and I will let you to guess what for . You ask how it is here in Montefalcone and I answer you . Pleasant but dirty . If these people could be persuaded to keep their streets clean and their plaster from falling down , it might be called attractiveand even beautiful .

Do you recall last week when I described the inability of these people to plan for the future because they only live for the present ? Well . About their women . This is one case where they are right . STOP . I can see that pretty face of yours flushing with anger . Let me put it in this fashion . Some of these women are beautiful .

How such a clown ever got in control of the government in the first place is beyond a puzzle , but then history shows that these people have an affinity for clowns. light-skinned , blue-eyed men . But then one loses interest in them because there is always this feeling ( I am sorry to be crude ) that their underwear , if indeed they have any on at all , is not clean . And so one loses interest . Frankly I think their interest in us is just be- cause we might have on clean underwear ourselves . Do this for me .

If your commanding officer says they should he shot for the best of all , they are shot . It is as simple as that . You have lost your con- cept of duty . Duty is what ? Duty is one 's responsibility to an idea larger than the self . This cancer of the self ! The putting of one 's conscience be- yond one 's duty is the true sickness of our time . Look at this place .

What they did was childish , of course , but it was also clever , in the manner of bright children everywhere .

There are no words on this one , as you recall , because the picture tells the story . Someone has gone about writing on them : " Yes , but why did you hit him in the first place ? " We took those down also . I think our basic error is that we have been attempting to treat these people as mature responsible beings , when our approach should have been to treat them as they actually are , that is , overage children .

Example : The German has an affinity for truth ; the nation is a reservoirof truth . When a German says he will be some place at six he will be there . No Italian will ever be at the appointed place on time , because he does not intend to be there . He will come late , but he127will have a remarkable lie to tell as to why he failed to arrive on time . All Italians have an affinity for the lie . Over-all conclusion : It is a mistake , then , to treat children as one would treat adults . Persuasion and logic are a waste of time . During the occupation the leader must conduct himself as a father  --  stern but understanding . As the father , one can take advantage of the German virtues , of organization , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , force , the usual method , is not needed except as a potentialthreat , such as the whip in the woodshed . We should rule by respect , as any father is respected by a child . Such a policy should release thousands and thousands of men for active duty now tied down in occupation police duties . Police are not needed for errant children , fathers are needed . Discuss these thoughts with Colonel Scheer . The captain was disappointed when Colonel Scheer stamped his letter to Klaus as " Approved , " without so much as glancing at it . It was the kind of letter a junior officer might wish his senior officer to see . " And now , shall we tune in Radio Cairo ? Just to see what lies they are telling , of course , " the colonel said . It was a standing joke , since it was accepted by all of them that the English provided the most reliable source of news . When the radio began to operate , officers from other rooms began to gather in the doorway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the English and the Americans in a place called Salerno , south of Rome and Naples . The Italians had declared themselves out of the war and would soon , in a matter of hours , come in again on the side of the Allies . " Oh , God , what good news , " the colonel said . " No longer do we have to lose men saving the wops . " When the broadcast was finished the colonel turned off the radio and faced the officers in the room and at the doorway . " There have been no official orders as yet , but you know what this means . As of this moment , Plan A is in effect . Unless I am seriously wrong , Operation Clutch will commence in a day or two . Plan A was a full combat alert , in which the Italians would be128treated like the people in any occupied territory , as the enemy and a source of potential danger . Operation Clutch was the formalplan designed to occupy Montefalcone and the rest of the outlying area . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building in which his men were billeted . He went up one flight of stairs and looked into a large cluttered room . " We do n't need formality , " he said . But the soldiers were startledby the presence of an officer in their quarters and they got to their feet in confusion . " Come to attention , " Sergeant Traub shouted at them , and all of them , even the naked soldier , came to attention and remained that way until von Prum released them . Along one wall of the room were buckets of glue and brushes and rolls of posters , this one showing a German soldier helping an old Italian woman across a busy street . The captain pointed to them . " You wo n't need those any longer , " he said . " We are at war with Italy . " Some of the soldiers smiled , and some waited to see what the proper action was supposed to be . The captain took this chance to examine his detachment . It was the first time he had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight . There were only eight of them , and all had been seriously wounded and were now on limited duty . The senior of them , Sergeant Gottfried Traub , had been hit in the face by shell fragments , and the muscles had been severed , so that the captain found it impossible to know what the sergeant was thinking from his expression . He had reached one conclusion , which was that the sergeant appeared happier when he was n't smiling at which time his face became distorted . " We 're all going to become soldiers again . No more glue pots , " the captain said . Once again the men did n't know how to take the news . He took out the map of this section of Italy . It was so typical and correct , von Prum thought , that the only reliable map of the whole area had been sent to him by his father from Mannheim . " You will note , " he said , " a good German map and so we are safe . At least we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sent to take . " 129His slender finger touched the city of Montefalcone . " We are here . " The soldiers , who were timid about doing it at first , began to gather around the map . " We eventually will be here . " He began to move his finger down the line from Montefalcone and out to the Mad River and along the red line on the map which marked the River Road . It was dark by then , and the noise of tanks and half-tracks from the streets and piazzas outside was so loud that he had to shout to make himself heard . They were wasting no time . " It 's on the mountain , as you can see . " The soldier who had been naked , Corporal Heinsick , had put on clothes and was leaning over the map . His thick , stubby finger touched the city and then crossed the map to the road . " There 's no line to it . There 's no road . " " There 's a road . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment will be equal to it . Are there other questions ? " The soldiers were silent because they were not accustomed to asking their officers questions . It bothered some of them and made them nervous . But one thing had been troubling them from the beginning and they looked at Sergeant Traub , and so he finally said it . " Sir ? There seem to be only eight of us , not counting yourself . " " That is correct . " Again there was an embarrassed silence and the man kept lookingat Traub . " Captain Pfalz has fifty in his command . They feel they need fifty to take and hold their town , sir . " " We need only eight . " They knew that it was the end to the questions , and they made a show of gathering around the map again to exhibit interest . Traub touched the name on the map . " Sanda Viddoria , " he said . " Yes . Santa Vittoria , " the captain said . " Ah , yes . Sanda Viddoria , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had grown dark . Walking the River Road in the dark is hard , but the darkness had brought the traffic out , hundreds of cars and trucksand half-tracks moving by the little light of hooded parking lights , all heading south and he could see by them . He was forced to theside of the road , but he could see . A few soldiers riding the trucks shouted at him and made gestures at him and one or two actuallyaimed their rifles at him , but Fabio failed to respond . Ile was no fun for them . At the gate into the city , still guarded by an Italian and a German , Fabio felt they would arrest him , but he did n't really care about that. 130131 " You 're not going to learn much at the academy , " the Italian guard told him . " It 's closed . " " He only shrugged and they passed him through . " Make Goddamn sure you check in with the prefect of police in the morning , " the guard told him , and Fabio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city seemed to be filled with trucks and armored vehicles , pressed up alongside the walls of the houses for protection , some of them with men in them , sleeping under camouflage nets . A few of them said things to Fabio in German , but he did n't really hear them . IIe went to the pensione where he had shared a room with two other students , and he found that Germans were in it . " What the hell do you think you 're doing here ? " the woman who ran the house shouted at him . " Do n't you know about the curfew ? Do n't you know what 's going on . You better get off the streets and out of here and stay out . " " What happened to my books ? " " They burned them . They used them to heat food . Page by page . " " Could n't you stop them ? " She laughed at him . " Then they would have used my furniture . I told them to do it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know where he was going . IIe decided to try to reach the house of Galbiati , an instructor he had been fond of and who had been fond of him . He went down the Corso directly into the Piazza Frossimbone . Soldiers sitting in the darkness of doorways said things to him , but he walked on at his own pace . It is hard to frighten anyone who has no more use for life . At one side of the piazza a large sign had been put up and it was lit by a light that was shielded from the sky . A group of German officers and noncornswere gathered about the sign discussing what it said and taking notes and Fabio walked across to it . The sign was a large , carefully drawn map of the Montefalcone region and on it , broken down into ten areas and twenty subareas , were the names of all the towns and villages that would be occupiedwithin the next several days . The information included the names of the occupying units , the day they would take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fabio , even in the con-132dition he was in , could appreciate the thoroughness of the work . San Pietro would be occupied tomorrow morning . Garafano Maggiori tomorrow afternoon , San Rocco del Lago the next evening . Santa Vittoria and Scarafaggio were listed as bring in Area R , Subareas 5 and 6 . The Germans would come on Wednesday , at 1700 hours . Three days . Not quite three days . At five o'clock in the afternoon . The bad time . How often things seemed to happen at the bad time , the seventeenth hour , Fabio thought . " It 's enough time for them , " Fabio told himself . He was n't sure if he said the words aloud . " They can ring their cork bell when they come . " He went through the little dark park in the center of the piazza and as he did he heard a girl struggling with a man . " Do n't do that to me , " she said . " You promised . You gave your word to my mother . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in good Italian , although he was German  --  and Fabio heard him hit her and then he heard her fall back through the underbrush and strike the ground and by the sounds he knew the German had run . " You had better stop that crying , " Fabio told her . He did n't know where she was , but the crying stopped and when he went to find her she had already gone . Girls who went with German soldiersdeserved what they got , he thought , although as he said it he knew the soldiers sometimes went to the girls ' houses and made it impossible for the families to refuse . All they could do was hope the German proved to be decent . " Oh , God , " he said aloud . Angela . They would do it to Angela . He knew at once , the same way he had known when he had seen Bombolini on top of the water tower , that he would have to go to Santa Vittoria and be the one to warn them . Now that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was excited , but his mind was clear and he knew exactly what he wanted to do . He got the rest of the way across the piazza without being seen and up into a dark narrow lane , and from this lane off into a series of lanes that kept him away from the Corso and the piazza but movingdeeper into the city where the workingmen lived . He found the house he was looking for , and when his knock was not an-233swered he tapped on the window , and when that went unansweredhe was about to go away , when the shutter was opened by a young woman who did not seem to be wearing any clothes . Fabio looked down . " Oh , " he said . " I wanted Gambo . I was expecting Gambo . " " He is n't here , he 's in the hospital . A rock fell on him in the quarry . " " Oh . I 'm sorry . " Fabio cleared his throat . " Is his bike here ? He said I could use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but tried to make him out in the darkness . " I need it . " " Stand over here . Let me see you . " She made him come near to the window and she held his head up . " Wait here , " she said , and in a moment he could hear the chain coming down from the door . " Now come in . " When he went in he could see the bicycle chained to an iron ring in the stone staircase , and when he looked further into the room he could see the girl and was surprised to find that she was wearing only a shirt , one of Gambo 's shirts . IIe was startled by her legs , because he had never actually seen a woman 's legs before , and even more startled when he found he could see almost all of her breasts , because the shirt was not buttoned all of the way to the top . He turned back to the bike . " A nice bicycle , " he said . " Gambo always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed and asked him who he was . " Fabio . Just call me Fabio . " " Just Fabio ? I ca n't loan a bike to someone called just Fabio , ' eh ? " " Bombolini . Fabio Bombolini , " he said . " From the Resistance . " She motioned him to come away from the door and into the room , and he looked at her quickly , because he had never seen anything like her , but when she sat down on the bed and turned back toward him he looked away again . The shirt was almost completely open . " How long have you known Gambo ? " " Oh , for years and years and years , " Fabio said . " How long has he been in the hospital ? " She leaned back on the bed , and Fabio could feel his heart pumping. 134 " Oh , for weeks and weeks and weeks , " she said , and he hlu.rhed . They talked about Gambo for a while , and Fabio found that the woman barely knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " she said . " I 'm looking at you . " " No you 're not . What am I doing now ? " She was swingingnsmall key chain around and around . Her breasts were bare . " Why do you look away ? " " I 'm not looking away . I 'm looking at you . It 's just that I was interested in the bike . I came for the bike . " " The bike is more interesting than me ? " " It 's a beautiful bike , " Fabio said . The nature of the silence , the coldness behind it , informed Fabio that he would have to say more . " You seem beautiful , too , " he said . " Then look at me for God 's sake . " He took his eyes away from the bike and looked at her , as calmly he could , determined to examine her in all objectivity , as if she were in anatomy class or was a new shirt . But he felt that the pounding of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then he found that his right leg was shaking so that anyone could see it . " The key to the bike . See ? " She held up the key chain . " If you want it you can come and get it . " He had heard about things such as this . There would be a game to get the key . Sex games , his father had called them . He realized he would have to play , but he did n't know how to begin and he did n't know the rules . She ended this by bringing his . hand to her neck so that he could feel the chain . " It 's thin , you see , but very strong , " she said . The game went swiftly enough after that , although it was a onesidedgame . She was expert at it . " Why are you trembling ? " she said , and he told her it was cold , although he was sweating , and she pulled back the sheet and pulled it over them , which made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was his holy medal . " St. Anthony of Padua . " " Take it off , " she told him . " I ca n't make love with a saint in between us . Your first time , eh ? " 135 " Oh , no , " Fabio said ; but she laughed , nicely , at him . " You 'll have a good teacher , " she said . " That 's very important . You 're awfully old to be beginning . " I will think only of Angela while I do this , Fabio promised himself . No , no , no . I will think only of the bicycle . I will remember that I am doing this as a duty in order to get the bicycle . He was conscious of the woman but he did not allow himself to enjoy the consciousness . In a way , he was performing a patriotic act in the line of duty . " Well , " she said at last . " Fabio , you 're a good student . " He wished she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had invested himself beyond the point of duty . " Someday you 'll make some woman a good lover . " He turned red , of course , and yet he found that he was n't displeased . " And I 'll tell you this , Fabio  --  Fabio what ? " " Della Romagna . " " I will tell you this , Fabio della Romagna : You may not be the best I 've ever had , but you 're the prettiest . " Despite himself , he found that he was smiling and could only hope that she had n't seen him smiling . " And one of the strangest . I think you are in love with bikes . " " Yes . I love bikes , " Fabio said , and he got up from the bed at once . He had forgotten the chain and the key , and when he turned back to her with such a sadness she laughed aloud and said , " Oh , God , " and reached up and worked the chain over her head while he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . " When you bring it back we 'll have lesson number two , " she said . When he got the bicycle out into the steep narrow street he was filled with elation . The bicycle rattled on the cobbles , and so he picked it up and put it on his back , and he barely noticed its weight . Near the bottom of the lane he realized he would have to go back and went all of the way back . When he tapped on the window she opened it . She was naked again , but this time he looked directly at her . " My Saint Anthony medal , please . My mother would never forgive me . " When she came back with it Fabio was able to smile at her. 136 " You 're not so bad at all , " he said . She started to close the shutter , but he held it with his hand . " One other thing , " he said . " I suppose I should know your name . After all . " " Gabriella . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very fitting , " he said , and he trotted back down the narrow dark street . Fabio , he told himself , you are becoming a goat . When he reached Santa Vittoria some of the older men were still in the Piazza of the People , seated around the fountain , waiting to hear the cork clapper strike twelve . They could not feed enough on the sound . " Fabio . Oh , Fabio , " Bombolini said when he saw him . " I knew you would come back to me . " The mayor embraced him . " You 're sweating like a pig , Fabio . " " I pedaled all of the way up the mountain . I have bad news . " " What could be bad news ? " Bombolini said . " I want you to hear the good news first . Paolo , go and ring the bell for Fabio . I want him to hear it . " " No . No . " Fabio stopped them . " The Germans are coming . " Once again Fabio experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other time . " I have seen the orders . Elements of the German army will arrivein Santa Vittoria at five o'clock in the afternoon on this comingWednesday . " It meant nothing to them , even Bombolini . He threw his bicycle down onto the stones of the piazza . " All right . I 've told you . I have done my duty . I risked my life . I have stolen a man 's bike . I have done all that I can . " For a moment he had the wild idea of riding back to the arms of Gabriella , his lover ; but he was too tired . Bombolini came after him . " We know it 's important , Fabio . We appreciate your coming and telling us . It 's just that we have expected it all along and there 's nothing much to be done about it . " " You could put your women away some place . " " If they touch the women they 'll pay for it and they know it . " " You could get that Abruzzi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 137 " No , he 's going to stay . He 'll be dressed like one of us . No one will be able to tell . " " Do you think all these people can keep a secret like that ? " " We can be a very loud people , " Bombolini said , " but when it is to our advantage to keep a secret we can keep one . Keeping a secret is a form of lying you understand . " They were almost all the way across the piazza by then , and at the edge of the Corso Cavoiir , where it drops down from the Piazza of the People into Old Town , Bombolini took hold of Fabio'sarm . " Do n't go away again , Fabio , " he said . " We need you here . " " Oh , I do n't know . I'nm thinking of going into the mountains . " He had n't thought of it before . " The Resistance , you know . " I shall go to the hills , Fabio told himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am the last one left , but I shall be unbowed . " When the Germans come , the policy here is going to be one of accommodation , do you understand ? " Bombolini said . Fabio made a face , but Bombolini did n't see it and did n't hear the sound of disapproval , because men generally seem to hear and see the things they wish to hear and see . " When they push , we will give . We 'll be like quicksand . " And I intend to be a rock , Fabio said , but to himself . " We do n't intend to be heroes here . We do n't want or need any heroes . We intend to do something a little better . We intend to survive . Thank you , Fabio , and now you get some rest . " He tried to answer the goodnight , but he could not force his lips to say the words . The only words in his head then were the ones of Petrarch he had memorized at the academy . Valor against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight quickly sped . For sure the ancient worth thatIn Italians stirs the heart , is not dead . It was midnight . It had been a long day . He was tired . He had come back to save Angela , and they had no desire to save their women . So be it . They wanted to accommodate themselves to the Germans . So be it . The day had n't been all wasted . There was138Gabriella , his lover . What was it she had said  --  someday you 'll make someone a good lover . If he had n't been concentrating so hard on the bicycle he probably could have shown her a thing or two . At last now he knew where his destiny rested . Up in the mountains . And just then , since it was twelve o'clock , the cork clapper began to ping against the metal of the bell , weak and thin and colorless . " Oh , God , what a people we are , " Fabio said aloud. 139ERGEANT Traub looked down in the Via San Sebasti- t.no and shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , " he , aid  --  " It 's what the colonel would authorize , " Captain von Prum said . " It 's enough for our needs . " In the street below them , parked up against the walls of the ! Rouses across the way , was one small truck capable of holding four soldiers in the back and two in the front . They would have to find a way to fit two more in . Behind the truck was a motorcycle with a sidecar that appeared to have been used in the First World War . Behind the truck , as an afterthought , trailed a small , bat- tered 2o-millimeter dual-purpose gun which had been designed 140 for use against tanks and airplanes and people and which now was used mainly to frighten street mobs . " In Russia they would have authorized us three times as much , " the sergeant said . " But this is n't Russia , is it , and these are n't Russians , are they ? " ' von Prum said . The soldiers nodded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank God for that . " " And we are n't going up there to wage war . " " That suits me , " Traub said . The captain looked at him closely . It was possible that the sergeant had lost his nerve in Russia , although his record showed that he had been a man of not just ordinary courage but unusual courage . The officer and his sergeantwere still in the process of feeling one another out . " What do you think of the Italians ? " von Prurn asked , in a very offhand manner . It was , however , a crucial question to him . He had chosen all of these men because of their understanding of Italian and it had been part of his reasoning that a man does n't learn another man 's language in order to despise him . " They 're all right , " Traub said . " They 're people . People tend to be people if you let them be , " the sergeant said . " They want their supper like I do . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What about you ? " The corporal had been cleaning his equipment and his back was to Captain von Prum . The captain could see that he had hairs on the back of his neck like the bristles on the back of a boar . He had been cleaning a bayonet and it was cleaned and he slapped the blade against his knee and slid it into the scabbard with one harsh movement . There was violence in the man , a reservoir of anger , but it also seemed to be controlled . Von Prum had been worried about him . " The wop is all right , " he said . " In some ways I like the wop . I just have no respect for them . " One of the other soldiers nodded openly then . " That 's the word for it , sir  --  no respect . I saw them at Smolensk . They went charging across the field on the attack and then theRusskies stopped and held and turned around , and you should have seen those sons of bitches come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in barracks before . " " Those bright-green uniforms and those crazy hats with the feathers ! You never saw anything like it . " " They were fast though . You have to admit that , " Heinsick said . " You could have formed a fine Olympic squad from that bunch . I can live with them , I just got no respect for them . " When the others nodded , the captain was well pleased . It was what he had wanted to hear . " I am not one given to generalizations , " he told them , " but there are certain truths about certain peoples that simple observation will bear out every time . " And he told them what these were . The average Italian , he told them , had no stomach for battle . It was not so much a matter of courage as much as having nothing worth dying for . " What man chooses to die for decay and corruption ? " They all nodded . " A basic observation , then , is that the Italian , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manipulate and bargain and make deals to protect what he has rather than fight for what he has . " " They fought up at Castelgrande last night , sir , " Traub said , in a voice as respectful as he could make it . " They had five or six dead up there . " " And you missed four words I said , Sergeant , " Captain von Prum said . " What were they ? " When the sergeant was unable to answer the captain said them . " When given the chance . Do you understand now ? Captain Moltke marched into Castelgrande and began to take things without even asking for them . There was nothing for the people to do but to fight . That 's going to be the difference with us . We are n't going to take , they 're going to give . " It was a secondary part of the captain 's theory that the Italian , even when he could get something in a straight and direct manner , wanted to get it by conniving for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results , or seem to produce results , but in the end , because the Italian lacks self-discipline , when conniving is pitted against a direct but disciplined opponent , conniving comes apart. 142 " In one last word , then , every Italian scheme contains the seeds of its own destruction , the Italian himself . " He was n't sure that the men understood , but he knew they were impressed by his talk . " They had fifty men at Castelgrande , sir , " Traub said . " And we have eight , " von Prum said . " And eight is all we will need . But I want no man to go with me who has no confidence in me or in my approach . " They backed him with shouts of approval . He was moved to smile then . " This is the difference between them and us , " he told them . And they smiled . " Ours will be a bloodless victory , " Captain von Prum said , and he knew at once that this was the title of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conservation of manpower and equipment during the confiscation of enemy assetsA report on the occupation of the city of Santa Vittoria under command of Sepp von Prum , Capt. , Inf . He even took time to write it down while the men were still standing about him . " The only red I expect to see is the red of their wine , " Captain von Prum told them. * * *When Fabio had gone and the bell had rung for the last time that night , Bombolini went back across the piazza , but all of the men had gone home . He turned toward the People 's Palace and then turned away because , although he was tired , he knew he could n't sleep then . He decided to walk through the city . IIe liked to walk through the city at night , because he thought of it then as his city and of the people as his people . They could sleep , because they knew he carried their burdens on his back . It was the price the leader paid and one he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Memorial Glade , and it was sad to look at the trees . During the other great war the people had143planted one beech tree in a little plot of land for each man who had gone away to the war . Each tree carried the soldier 's name and a little picture of him . There was a belief that as long as the tree lived the soldier would live . But then people who had grievancesagainst another family would sneak into the grove at night and cut down that family 's tree , or at least take off a limb in the hope that a member of the family would lose a leg or an arm at least . He went back up the Corso Cavour , because he knew he could sleep , and went inside the Palace of the People and to his room . Before going to sleep , however , he stopped at Roberto 's doorway . " Do you think the Germans will come here ? " he said . Roberto was annoyed . It was three o'clock in the morning . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was in the air forces . " " There 's nothing for them here . " Roberto nodded . " Only your wine , " he said , and he was sorry to be disrespectful , but he closed his eyes and fell back to sleep . " There 's no road up here at all , " Bombolini said . But the sound of Roberto 's breathing told him that his argument was being wasted . " I 'm sorry . Sometimes I get to be a bore , " he said , and he went to his room and to bed . When he woke again the sun still had not risen and so he knew he could not have slept for more than an hour at the most . Somethinghad been troubling him and he found a candle and a flint to light it with and began going through the book . " Men are apt to deceive themselves in great things while being scrupulous about the small ones . " He felt a cold hand rest on his heart and begin to squeeze it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might stop it . He knew what the words meant . It was only that morning that Babbaluche had said to him , " We lie about the truth , that 's what ruins us here . And do you know why we lie about the truth ? Not because we like to , but because we are scared to death of it . If we looked the truth in the eye nine out of ten of us would run to the graveyard and demand to be buried at once . " He got up then and walked by Roberto 's room and was going towake him but decided against it , even though it was Roberto who had seen the truth . Man sees what he sees and hears what he hears , he thought , and the few who do n't are generally considered to he nnul . Ile went downstairs and out into the Piazza of the . People whete une of the madmen was already in the piazza , on his knees by tin ' fountain , screaming at him , Bombolini . " You son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . Do it now . " It was Old Vines . Bombolini trotted across the rough stones . " Get up now , " he said . " I know . There 's no sense in terrifying the people before we have a plan . " Others had heard , however , the ones who get up in darkness before the sun even , and they were coming across the piazza . " Tell them the truth , " Old Vines shouted . " Do n't lie to us . " Ile got up from his feet then , his face as red as any wine he had ever aged , and turned to them . " The Germans are coming , " he shouted , " and they 're going to take our wine . " To the south there is an old Roman city that was buried in the ash of a volcano . Although no one here has ever seen it , people say that in this city there are figures of people who are locked forever in the ash at the moment of their doing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoon 's length away from eating and those just reaching for the wine will never taste it . It was this way in the piazza in Santa Vittoria that morning . When people heard the words , they recognized them as the truth at once and they seemed , for a time at least , to be turned into stone and to be so stiff that if they moved they would crack and fall into pieces on the stones . Bombolini was the first to move . He turned away and started back toward the Palace of the People . " They 're going to come and take our wine , " Old Vines screamed . The mayor continued to walk away from them as if he did n't hear . " What are you going to do ? " someone shouted . " What can we do ? " Bombolini closed the door behind him and locked it and went up the stairs and woke Roberto. 144 145 " You have to help me now . Do n't let anyone in . I must rest . I must go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I can do . " * * *Traub was one who rose with the sun . It was a habit that had begun on the family farm and continued with him into the army . He believed it was a sin to be down when the sun was up . " The early sun is gold in the mouth , " his mother said to him . " Yes , the bed is a thief , " his father would say . He was worried . In two day 's time they would be going up a mountain into an unknown city with one officer and two non-coms and six privates , all of them limited-duty soldiers because of previouswounds . IIe waited for an hour and finally knocked on Captainvon Prum 's door . " I want to put a reconnaisance up in Santa Vittoria this afternoon , sir , " Traub called through the door . Ile could hear that the captain was up but he was n't asked into the room because in the German army it was n't considered good for morale and discipline for soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Captain von Prum said . " But the book says , sir , " Traub said . " I 'm not interested in the book . This is not a military problem . It 's a psychological problem . Do you understand that word ? " The sergeant said that he did . " I want to make the strongest possible first impression on these people . If we arrive there with nine men it will impress them . These people lay great store on first impressions . " " But , sir , if there 's a road block . . . " Von Prum opened the door of the room and looked at his sergeant . " The German army has not yet become a debating society , " von Prum said . Von Prum smiled , because the words had the same effect on the sergeant that they had had on himself the night before when Colonel Scheer shouted them at him . The colonel had had second thoughts about the wisdom of the bloodless victory . The bastard is making me pay in blood for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but when the colonel summoned him he had gone at a run . " No , it all stinks of an experiment , " the colonel had said . " It 's all right to experiment with Poles . It 's all right to try things %ith Jews . It 's not all right with the grandson of Schmidt von Knobles. dorf . If anything happens to Captain von Prum , Willy Scheer will be the one to hang for it . " Scheer was a rare case , the peasant who had risen through the ranks to a position of power without discarding his peasant ways . His manner was rough and direct , his speech was filled with folk sayings , most of them coarse , and he looked as if he had been carved from a potato . It amused him and it flattered him to have aristocrats around him and beneath him . " No , I ca n't let you go , " Scheer said . " The cream of our culture , the flower of our people . " He was being sarcastic but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could go . But a blood relationof Alfons Mumm von Schwarzenstein ? Oh , no . It 's not your ass I worry about , it 's Willy Scheer 's ass . " The captain had stared at him . Von Prum knew it was the correctthing to do then . For reasons he did n't understand , Scheer enjoyed being stared at in a cold haughty manner . " You look at me as if I was manure in the field , " he said . " Like I was shit . " But he smiled . " You heard what happened at Castelgrande , " the colonel said . " They went in with fifty men . " " And Moltke , " von Prum said . Captain Moltke was famous for his short temper . When he had encountered a small road block , Moltke had ordered his men to fire on the people of the town and they had no choice but to fire back . " Well take a tank at least , " Scheer said . The captain shook his head and continued to stare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , " he finally asked . " The culture of the German people , " von Prum said . " Our nationalsense of purpose . Our genius at working with disciplined order . " " Oh you are such a good boy , " Scheer said . " My God what a fine noble boy . " He was shaking his head by then . " Do you really believe this . " 146 I 147 " I really believe it , " von Prum said . " It is n't the idealist 's way . It is n't the dreamer 's way . It 's the only sensible , practical way to do it . You 'll see . " These were the words that angered the colonel and this was when he told the captain that the army had not yet become a debating society . What the captain said went against all the rules Scheer had had to learn so painfully in his life . " You listen to me , " Scheer said . " We do n't learn much in the turnip fields but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them is that the one thing that gets respect , the only thing that gets respect , is strength . The weak respect the strong for one reason . Because they 're not weak like themselves . " The colonel thumped his hard brown stubby hand clown onto the hard wooden table . " Here 's one of those quaint peasant sayings , Captainvon Prum . One must be either the anvil or the hammer . ' You think about it . There is no other way . " But in the end von Prum had won , as he knew he would win , because in the end he was what the race aspired to , and he knew this and knew that Scheer knew it and approved of it . His Nordic bleaching , as the colonel called it , the blondness and whiteness and the cold blueness of him , was not just the symbol of racial purity but the fact of it . Most Germans , like most of the people of the world , are dark and short , but unlike other people the Germansdespise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . It is von Prum they put on all their posters , and when they have a baby it is von Prum they hope to produce . " You push me too Goddamn hard , " Scheer said , " but then again the German army has not yet become a place where officers go back on their words . " They smiled at one another then . " Take a tank , " Scheer said . Von Prum shook his head . " My God you 're stubborn , " Scheer said . His voice became hard again . " This experiment has only one solution , and that is that it must work . " " I understand . " " If it does n't , I come up there and do things in my way , " Scheer said . Von Prum nodded his head . " Because I 'm committed for that wine . " " You will get your wine . " The colonel began to walk toward the door of his office and by this the captain knew the interview was over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I want all of it . " IIc stopped at the door . " When you are ready you let us know , make it soon , and we will come and get the wine . " " But that 's all part of it , " von Prum said . " When the time comes I intend to have the people bring it out themselves . " " You expect the people to collaborate in their own robbery , " he said . His voice was bitter . " Yes , " von Prum said , so quietly and with such little doubt that his arrogance finally caused the colonel to laugh aloud . " You know one thing that is n't right for a Schmidt von Knoblesdorf ? " He ran his stubby fingers down the front of the captain 's tunic . " You 're a virgin here . No decorations . " It had bothered von Prum 's father . Once he had even offered to lend the captain several of his before they went to church . " I will tell you what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can get the people of this place . . . what 's the name ? " " Santa Vittoria . " " If you get these people to bring their own wine to the railroad here I will recommend you for the Iron Cross . " Von Prum smiled at this . " Third class , of course , " Scheer said , " but an Iron Cross never-theless . " The captain was excused then , but at the foot of the stairs he turned back to the colonel . " As for you , " he called up , " I 'll put your name on the cover of the Bloodless Victory . " " No , to hell with that , " Scheer said . " After the war you invite me to your home for dinner . Let me come in the front door . " He smiled his hard tough smile . " Have me with that fellow you 're always quoting . " Von Prum was puzzled . " Nitcha , " Scheer said . " Your friend Nitcha . " " Nietzsche , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , I 'm sorry to hear it , " Colonel Scheer said . " Have me with all the ancestors then . " " Ill do that , " Captain von Prum said . " And I 'll toast you in the wine of Santa Vittoria. " * * * Considering the state of things in Santa Vittoria they were good to Bombolini ; they allowed him to sleep until eleven o'clock , and then they told Roberto to go and wake him . When he looked in the door he was surprised to see how peacefully the mayor was sleeping . " They 're waiting for you down there , " Roberto told him . " Yes , I know that . I can sense them . " " The whole piazza is filled with people . " " They do n't know what to do . They do n't have their leader . " The mayor rose from the bed and moved very slowly and easily , and the manner in which he moved convinced Roberto that he must have found an answer during his sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can sense them , " Bombolini said . " I can feel them . I can smell them . They say a horse can smell water before he can see it when he needs it . I can smell them and they can smell me . Do you know what I did , Roberto ? " " No . " " I had a good sleep . " He tapped his head and at the same time attempted to brush down his mane of hair , which was wild , so wild that Babbaluche once claimed that a bird could nest in it and Bombolini would never know it until he got egg on his face . " God came to me , I think . He put something in here . Let 's go down . " They went down the steps into the large room where all of the members of the Grand Council were gathered . " God put a story in my head . I want to tell it to you and you can tell me what it means . I think the answer is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stood against the walls , and Italo Bombolini told them the story of the peasant Gagliaudi. * * * A thousand years ago , some invaders from the north called bar- barians came to conquer Italy under the leadership of a man named Barbarossa . Everything fell before the barbarians until 150 they came to one walled city to the north of here that refused to lie down and surrender . They tried everything to make it fall , but when they failed they decided to surround the city and starve it out . Winter came and the people began to go hungry and everyoneknew it was only a matter of time . It was then that the peasantGagliaudi went to the prince with a plan . " Give me all the wheat that is left in the city and give me all the grain that is left , and I will save the city . If I do n't , then kill me . " " Do n't worry , I wo n't have to do that . They 'll do it for me . " But against his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he gave the wheat and the grain to the peasant . The people were shocked and outraged when the peasant began to feed the preciousfood to his cow . " Now bring me the last of the water , " Gagliaudi ordered . The people by then were chewing stones to keep their mouths wet , but the cow drank and drank . " Now bring me the last of the wine . " They watched in rage as the peasant sat before them and drank the last of the wine and got drunk before their faces . When he was drunk enough , early in the morning just before dawn , a little side gate in the wall was opened and the drunk peasant and his bloated cow slipped outside the city 's walls . Once outside , along the road where the enemy camped , Gagliaudi began to sing and laugh and roar , and he kicked the cow so that it mooed and bellowedin protest . The enemy could not believe their eyes any more than the people of the city , who were peeping from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have been made fools of , " they all agreed . The guards of Barbarossa realized at once that only a madman or a drunk could behave in this manner , and when they seized the peasant he fell to his knees . " Oh God help me , what have I done ? " He wept . He cried aloud . " I was taking my cow to the grainery and I opened the wrong door . Oh , do n't harm me . Please . Take me to Barbarossa . I have a proposition for him . " They dragged the weeping drunk to the warrior , and he looked with astonishment at the drunk man and the fat sleek cow . " I have a proposition for you , " Gagliaudi said . " Do n't kill me . Please do n't harm me . " " Italians always have propositions , " Barbarossa said . " It 's how we survive , " the peasant said . " We 're weak . But if you will let me go I will promise to go hack inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back my twelve cows . " " Twelve like this ? " " No , not like this . " He kicked the fat cow . " Twelve that are fat and filled with meat and milk . Not this beast . I was treating her , sir . Ca n't you see ? She 's sick . " It was Barbarossa who was sick , sick at the sight of all of that beef on the hoof . " Do you mean to tell me you have twelve more like that inside the walls ? " " Only my own , sir . Just my own . All of the others belong to someone else and I ca n't give them to you . " Barbarossa was above all things a good soldier , and a good soldierrecognizes when he is beaten . The city clearly had enough food to last them for two more years at least . That afternoon he packed up his army and he left . The city was saved. * * *They all looked at one another . It seemed to be saying something to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " It 's in there , " Bombolini shouted to them . " Otherwise why would He have put it there , eh ? " But they were silent . It was a strange story ; every man in the room felt that the answer was flitting about inside his brain waiting to fly out on his tongue , but when it came time to open the mouth nothing came out . " It 's like those parables in the Bible , " someone said . " Just when I seem to understand and have it in my hands it hops away from me . " They looked at each other as if by staring very hard into one another 's eyes they would unlock the answer in their minds . A long time passed . They heard the thin sound of the bell telling that it was midday , and no one in the room was any closer to the secret of Gagliaudi. 152 " To hell with all this , " Pietro Pietrosanto suddenly shouted . " To hell with this bum and his cow . I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their minds were tired from the pressure of the thinking , and the idea of fighting seemed good then . At least it was doing something . " I say dig in down in the rocks by the big bend in the road in the terraces and the sons of bitches will never get us out . " Another cheer . " Sometimes you make people spill a little blood for what they want , and you find they do n't want it so much any more . " The problem with Bombolini was that he was torn between voices . Men often deceive themselves in believing that humility can overcome insolence . Any way that you read that , it meant to resist , to fight . " I say this to you , " a young man shouted . " The German who touches my wine or my wife pays for his touch in blood . " A very big cheer then . And yet The Master had also said : Cunning and deceit will every time serve a man better than force . Bombolini was confused and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fear dancing in the back of his mind like cold needles , like the sun , cold and brilliant , on ice . The Master was failing him . " Fabio was right , he was the one who knew , " another young man was now shouting . " What good is it to save yourself and then crawl around your own country like a dog looking for a bone ? " " Mussolini was right . Better to live one day as a lion than one hundred years as a lamb . " A great cheer then and the eyes turned on the mayor , because it was he who had painted out the sign . All these brave words , these cries of valor . How to answer them ? He thought of one more sayingof Machiavelli : Deceit in the conduct of war outweighs valor and is worthy of merit . How could that be explained to them ? How to tell a bunch of men bent on becoming heroes that it would be more heroic of them to practice being cowards ? Just as Fabio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosa Bombolini 's uncle , stood up in the room153and struck the floor with his mulberry stick until there was silence . " You forget who you are , " he shouted . " You forget where you come from . You think you 're warriors and you shout like heroes and you are a bunch of grape growers . " There was silence , because everyone knew what Tommaso said was so . " A bunch of grape growers . " Silence . " We have no heroes here . This is no country for heroes . If you want to be martyrs , go be martyrs somewhere else . We ca n't afford martyrs in Santa Vittoria . " Silence . " Tend to your grapes . " Silence . " Because you forget the one lesson that every Santa Vittorian has known for the last thousand years : Brave men and good wine do n't last long . " * * *Everyone went outside after that . All idea of the fight was ended . The people were waiting for them in the piazza . " We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some-thing . " As if it were a command , they began to go across the Piazza of the People and down the Corso Cavour to the Cooperative Wine Cellar . In the absence of anything to do they were making a pilgrimageand performing an act of faith in the wine , the way people in other places might go into a church and pray for guidance . They filed in through the narrow door , into the cool dimness and smelt the incense of the cellar , that sweet sharp smell of the herbs that go into the vermouth , and went down through the tiers of wine which look like tall pews in an attitude of reverence . It is a true sea of wine in that cellar , a rich dark-red sea held in bottles . To the south of here there are towns where people make the sign of the cross over each crust of bread before they eat it , and we are the same way with the wine . To say something loud or vulgar , to utter an obscenity in the presence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cathedral . The sight of so much wine , all that wine to be stolen , was too great for Bombolini to bear , and he went out of a little-used side door and back up a narrow back lane until he reached the piazza and the Palace of the People and found Roberto . " Have you figured out the story yet ? " he said . Roberto looked puzzled . " The dream . My dream . What does it mean ? You 're the American . You know everything . " He was shouting at Roberto , but then he stopped and sat down . " What are you doing ? " " Arithmetic . My arithmetic . I 'm figuring out the hours until they come . " Bombolini did n't want to know . He preferred it that way . Without any plan it was better to just let them come when they came , unprepared for and unannounced . " All right , " he said finally . " How many . " " They 'll be here in fifty-three hours " When he heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in large block letters , as bright and clear as the lights on the theater in Montefalcone , flashing on and off  --  53 . . . 53 . . . 53 53  --  and it was minutes before the glow of the lights would leave his brain . He went to the window of Roberto 's room and looked down at the people standing in the midday sun in the piazza , and he looked at the wall and at a picture of St. Sebastian being rent with arrows . " Quick , now . As fast as you can say the words . If you were me what would you do with the wine ? " " Hide . " " What ? " " Hide it . " " You would hide it ? " " Yes , hide it , " Roberto said . " Oh , Roberto . So simple and clean and beautiful that it 's almost stupid , " the mayor said , and he struck Roberto such a blow on the arm that it was weeks before the American could raise it without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ von Prum wrote this , the second letter to his brother Klaus . Klaus : You falter , you lose sight again . I cease to preach to you . Do n't take a brother 's word , take instead the words of a man you profess to admire . " You say it is the good cause that hallows even war . I say unto you : It is the good war that hallows any cause . " Need I say more , Klaus ? " It is a sad fact , but a fact , that war and courage have accomplishedmore great things than love of thy neighbor . Not your pity but your courage will save the unfortunate . " Need any more ? One more , then. 156 I 157 " What is good ? " you ask . " To be brave is good . " Your men were not brave , Klaus , and for that they paid the price , as any evil person must pay . I finish with Nietzsche . " What matters long life ? What warrior wants to be spared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within two days , as I intimated to you . I have my duty , you have your duty . Wish me luck , Klaus , even as I wish you the same. * * *The effort to hide the wine was a failure . Within the first half hour of the experiment , before twenty thousand bottles had been taken from the Cooperative Wine Cellar and brought up into the Piazza of the People it was clear to anyone who wished to see it that the experiment was no longer worth going on with . But peoplesometimes are more willing to go on with the work than face up to the failure . They piled the bottles in the piazza and then the different familiesbegan to hide them in their houses . They put them in closets and under beds and behind pictures and in the backs of fireplaces and then in the drains and on the roofs and under loose tiles and then in the manure piles and on grapevine hung down the chimneys . " Keep the wine in the shadows , the sun is bruising it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you put a newborn baby in the sun ? This wine is n't even born yet . Do n't shake the wine . Would you shake a newborn baby ? This wine is n't born yet . " Sometime in the early afternoon Bombolini summoned the courage to ask the keeper of the wine how many bottles remained to be hidden , and when Old Vines told him , it was a matter of several minutes before he could make himself hear the figures , and when he did he wrote them on a card  --  " 1,32o,000 . " Each time he looked at the number he found it hard to comprehend . He held the card up first on one side and then on the other , as if somehow , if he twisted it in enough ways , the value of the numbers might change . Even if they hid ioo , 000 bottles , whichwas impossible , it was only one thirteenth of the wine and by enormous effort they would have achieved nothing . At four o'clock there was to be an inspection of the hiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people knew what they would report . A few minutes later the first of them came back . " It 's no good , Captain . It is n't working right , " Longo 's son said . " You can see bottles everywhere . Everytime you turn around in the Pietrosanto house you sit on a bottle , you step on a bottle , you break a bottle . The beds are lumpy with bottles . " It was the same everywhere . " Bring the bottles back out , " Bombolini ordered , and he felt at that moment the dread of failure . To the credit of the people he passed , none of them said anything to him . IIe went back across the piazza , passing the bottles piled on the cobblestones and piled in carts , seeing and not seeing at the same time the people going into the houses and starting to bring the wine back out . He had the weight of the city and of one thousand people and now one million bottles of wine to carry . It was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt someone pulling on him and he turned to look . It was Fungo , the idiot . It is said that when a man is drowning , just as he goes down , he will grab at a twig in the water and for that moment really believe that it will hold him ; and so , at this moment , Bombolini stopped to listen to Fungo . " I have something to tell you , " Fungo said . " Tell . Tell me . " Out of the mouths of babes and idiots and drunks  --  Who could tell until he listened ? " Tufa 's back , " the boy said . " Oh , Christ above ! " " You have a filthy mouth , " the boy said . " Excuse me . How do you know ? " The boy told him how he had gone to Tufa 's house to see if he could find any bottles and he had found Tufa there , in the dark , lying on the floor . " He 's dying , " Fungo said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me. " 158 " Who ? " " Tufa . And he should know . " I will attend to Tufa , he thought . It was at least something positiveto do . I will make every effort to save Tufa 's life . He thought for a moment that he was crying , and then he looked up and was surprised to see that it was raining . The people were running past him , getting out of the piazza before the full force of the rain reached them . The people here love the rain and they love to see it rain . It is not going too far to say they adore the rain in Italy , but as soon as they see a drop they run from it . Old Vines caught up to Bombolini . " Stop them , " he shouted . " You have to order them to stay . We ca n't leave the wine out here . The rain will wash the dust from the bottles . The rain will chill the wine . " Bombolini looked at the old man as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cares ? " he said . " Do we have to have the wine at room temperature for the Germans when they come ? " " Wine is wine no matter who has it , " the old man shouted . " To abuse wine is to abuse life itself . " Now he was shaking Bombolini by the shoulders and shouting something about killing him . " Then fuck the wine , " Bombolini said . Old Vines fell away from him . " Oh , you sin , " he said . Neither of them felt the rain that was falling hard by then . " You sin against the wine . " I fully expect the next bolt of lightening to strike me in the heart , Bombolini thought . He pushed the cellar master to one side and started down the Corso Cavour to Old Town and Tufa 's mother 's house . IIe had made up his mind to keep all of his thoughts on Tufa . There were strange things about Tufa . He was , for one , an officerin the army , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it did n't . Even worse , he was a Fascist , but this had never stopped him from being a hero to the young people here and a person to whom the old were not afraid to turn for help when he was home . The thing about Tufa was that he was a true Fascist , a real Fascist , who believed all the glorious words and tried to **25;7447;TOOLONG Yakov Ivanovitch , what I have to say is this . I have an empty flat on the next story , recently vacated  --  the ten- ants proved entirely unsuitable  --  four fine rooms that need painting and repapering . If you care to undertake the task I offer forty rubles , which is more than I would ordinarily pay , considering the fact that I furnish the paint and other materials ; but the circumstances in this case are different . It is , of course , a matter of gratitude , but would n't you rather work than peremptorily receive from me some silver coins ? Is money ever valuable if it is come by without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of merit . Notwithstanding you did me the greatest of favors  --  I might have suffocated in the snow , as Zina points out  --  is n't my offer of work a more estimable re- ward than a mere payment of money ? " He looked ea- gerly at Yakov . " Therefore will you accept ? " " In the way you put it , yes , " said Yakov . He got up quickly , said he had to be going , and after stumbling into a closet on his way out , hurriedly left the apartment . Though he worried what he was getting into and changed his mind every half hour as he lay restlessly on his bed-bench that night , the next morning he went back . He returned for the same reason he had gone the first time  --  to collect his reward . What he earned for his work in this case was the reward . Who could afford to say no to forty rubles  --  a tremendous sum ? Therefore why worry about returning ? Go , do the job quickly , collect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket , leave the place once and for all and forget it . After all it 's only a job , I 'm not selling my soul . When I 'm finished I 'll wash up and go . They 're not bad people . The girl 's direct and honest in her way , though she makes me uneasy , and as for the old man , maybe I misjudged him . How many goyim have I known in my life ? Maybe someone stuck that Black Hundreds pin on his coat when he was drunk in the tavern . Still , if it 's really his own I 'd like to ask him straight out , " Nikolai Maximovitch , will you please explain how you can cry for a dead dog yet belong to a society of fanatics that urges death on human beings who . ? ? happen to be Jews ? Explain to me the logic of it . " Then let him answer that . What also troubled the fixer was that once he went to work , even though the " reward " made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might be asked to produce his passport , a document stamped " Religious Denomination : Judaic , " which would at once tell NikolaiMaximovitch what he was hiding from him . He chewed his lips over that but decided that if the passport was asked for he would say the police in the Podol had it ; and if Nikolai Maximovitch insisted he must produce it , that was the time to quit or there would be serious trouble . It was therefore a gamble , but if you were against gambling , stop playing cards . He guessed the Russian was probably too muddled to ask for the passport although he was required to by law . Still , after all , it was a reward , maybe he would n't . Yakov was now somewhat sorry he had n't at once identified himself as a Jew by birth . If that had killed off the reward , at least there would be no self-contempt . The more one hides the more he has to . He did an expert job on the flat  --  scraped the walls clean of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He plastered where he had to , then thickly calcimined the ceilings  --  nothing but the best for NikolaiMaximovitch . And he pasted the wallpaper neatly though his experience with papering was limited  --  in the shtetl only Viskover , the Nogid , was that fancy . Yakov worked all day and into the night by yellow gaslightto get the job done , collect his rubles , and disappear . The landlord , stopping now and then to catch his breath , labored up the stairs each morning to see how the work was progressing , and expressed himself as most42 43pleased . In the afternoon he got out his vodka bottle , into which he had cut strips of orange peel , and by sunsetwas drunk . Zina , unseen during the day , sent up the cook , Lidya , with a snack at lunchtime  --  a fish pie , bowl of borscht , or some meat dumplings so delicious it seemed to the fixer he would have done the job for the food alone . One night Zina limped up the stairs , expressing surprise he was working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since lunch , and when he said he was not hungry she suggested , nervously laughing , that he eat supper with her , Papa having already retired and she liking company . The fixer , greatly surprised by the invitation , begged off . He had , he explained , too much to do , and apologized for his clothes . Zina said not to mind that . " Clothes can be shed in a minute , Yakov Ivanovitch , but whether they are or not can not change a man 's nature . He 's either kind or he is n't , with or without clothes . Besides I do n't care for excessive formality . " He thanked her but said he could n't take the time off from work . There were two more rooms to do . The next evening she came up again and somewhat agitatedly confessedshe was lonely ; so they ate together in the kitchen downstairs . She had dismissed Lidya and throughout the meal talked constantly , mostly of her childhood , the young ladies ' school she had attended , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long and hot , but nights are languorous and starlit . People refresh themselves in their flower gardens and some walk in the parks , drink kvass and lemonade , and listen to the symphonies . Have you ever heard Pagliacci , Yakov Ivanovitch ? I think you would love MarinskyPark . " He said he did not mind parks . " The Contract Fair opens in the spring , it 's most entertaining . Or if you like there 's a cinematograph to go to on the Kreshchatik . " Her eyes darted glances as she spoke and when he looked at her she glanced away . Afterwards the fixer , made nervous by her chatter , excused himself to go back to work , but Zina followed him up the stairs to watch him paste on the wallpaper she had selected , bunches of blue roses . She sat on a kitchen chair with her legs crossed , the good one over the crippled , and cracked and ate dried sunflower seeds , rhythmically swinging her leg as she watched him work . Then she lit and awkwardly smoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't possibly treat you as an ordinary common laborer for the simple reason that you are n't one . Certainly not in my eyes . Really you are a guest who happens to be working here because of Papa 's idiosyncratic ways . I hope you realize that ? " " If you do n't work you do n't eat . " " Quite true , but you are more intelligent and even genteel  --  at any rate , sensitive  --  please do n't shake your head over that  --  than the average Russian laborer . I ca n't tell you how exasperating they can be , particularly Ukrainians , and really we dread having repairs or improvementsmade . No , please do n't deny it , anyone can sense you are different . And you told Papa you believe in the necessity of an education and would like to furtheryour own . I heard you say that and approve very much . I too love to read , and not only romances . I 'm sure you 'll find excellent opportunities for yourself in the future , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Papa . " Yakov went on papering . " Poor Papa suffers dreadfully from melancholia . He gets quite drunk by nightfall and has no appetite , tospeak of , for supper . He usually falls asleep in his chair , Lidya removes his shoes , and with Alexei 's help we get him to bed . At night he awakes and says his prayers . Sometimes he undresses himself , and it 's almost impossible to find his clothes in the morning . Once he put his socks under the rug , and I found his drawers , all wet , in the water closet . Usually he is n't awake till midmorning . It 's hard on me , of course , but I ca n't complain because Papa 's had a difficult life . And there 's no one to keep me company in the evening but Lidya and at times Alexei when he happens to be fixing something , but quite frankly , Yakov Ivanovitch , neither of them has an idea in his head . Alexei sleeps in the basement , and Lidya 's small room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyondPapa 's bedroom ; and since I would rather read at night than listen to her go on and on , I dismiss her early . Sometimes it gives me pleasure to be the only one up in the house at night . It 's very cozy . I light the samovar , read , write letters to old friends and crochet . Papa says I make the most remarkable lace doilies . He marvels at the intricacy of the patterns . But most of the time , " she sighed , " to tell the truth , it can be dreadfully lonely . " She chewed a sunflower seed disconsolately , then remarked that although she had been crippled through illnessas a child , she had always been considered attractive by the opposite sex and had had more than one admirer . " I do n't say this to flaunt myself or be brazen but because I do n't want you to think of me as being at a disadvantagewith regard to the normal experiences of life . I am nothing of the sort . I have a quite attractive figure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Once in a restaurant a man ogled me so insistently Papa went over to him and demanded an explanation . The man humbly apologized and do you know , Yakov Ivanovitch , when I got back home I broke into sobs . " Gentlemen called on her of course , Zina went on , butunfortunately not always the most sensitive or worthy , a situation more than one of her friends had to put up with . Sensitive , dependable men were rare , although such persons could be found in all classes , not necessarily gentry . He listened with one ear , aware that her glance traced his every move . Why does she bother ? he asked himself . What can she see in a man like me whose advantages are all disadvantages if I have it right ? I have little wit in Russian , it 's a heavy language for me . And if I said " Jew " aloud she 'd run in six directions . Yet she often entered his thoughts . He had been a long time without a woman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her . He had never had a Russian woman , though Haskel Dembo had slept with a peasant girl and said it was the same as with any Jewess . The crippled leg , Yakov thought , would not bother him . He finished papering the fourth room that night and except for the woodwork the job was done . Two days later when it was all but finished , Nikolai Maximovitch unsteadily ascended the stairs to inspect the flat . He went from room to room , running his fingers over the wallpaper , looking up at the ceilings . " Outstanding , " he said . " Quite outstanding . An honestand attractive piece of work , Yakov Ivanovitch . I congratulate you . " Later he said as though in afterthought , " You must excuse me for asking , but what are your political predilections ? Surely you 're not a Socialist ? I ask in the strictestconfidence without attempting to pry , and not in the least accusatorily . I ask , in a word , because I am interested in your future . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The world 's full of it but it 's not for me . Politics is not in my nature . " " Very good , indeed . Neither am I , and much betteroff in the bargain if anyone should ask . Yakov Ivanovitch , do n't think I will soon forget the quality of your craftsmanship . If you should care to go on working for me , though in another , and may I say , advanced capacity , I would be more than happy to employ you . The truth of the matter is that I am the owner of a small brickworks nearby , although in a contiguous district . I inherited it from my elder brother , a lifelong bachelor who went to his final reward half a year ago after sufferingfrom an incurable disease . I tried to sell the factory but the offers were so disgraceful that , although I have little heart or , at this time of my life , head for business , I have kept it going , although , I confess , barely profitably . My foreman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is otherwise an ignorant man , and confidentially , the drivers who work under him have not been accounting for every brick that leaves the yard . I would like you to go in as a sort of overseer to handle accounts and , on the whole , look after my interests . My brother was involved in every phase of the operations , but I have little patience with bricks . " Yakov , though he had listened with excitement to the proposition , confessed he was without experience in business . " I know nothing about bookkeeping . " " Common sense is what 's needed in business once honesty is assured , " said Nikolai Maximovitch . " What there is to learn you will learn as you go along . I usually visit for an hour one or two mornings a week , and what you do n't know I 'll try to help you with , though I frankly confess my knowledge is limited . There 's no need to protest , Yakov Ivanovitch . My daughter , whose judgment in these matters I respect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may believe me , I thoroughlyshare it . She considers you a man of sobriety and sound sense , and I am confident that after you have masteredthe fundamentals you will do a responsible andeffective job . During the period of your  --  ah  --  apprenticeshipI will pay you forty-five rubles monthly . I hope that 's satisfactory . But there is another advantage for you that I should mention , frankly one that will work to our mutual benefit . My brother converted part of a loft over the brickyard stable into a warm and comfortable room , and you may live there without payment of rent if you accept my offer . " The forty-five rubles astounded and tempted the fixer . " What is it an overseer does ? Excuse the question , but I 'm not a man of the world . " " Worldliness is vanity , it does n't appeal to me . The overseer manages the business end of the enterprise . We manufacture about two thousand bricks daily  --  many fewer than we used to  --  a thousand or so more during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year ; and it has been fewer lately although we have a contract with the Kiev Municipal Council for several thousands of bricks . The Tsar himself has given orders for civic improvementsto be made before the Romanov Jubilee , and the Municipality is tearing up wooden walks and laying down entire streets of brick sidewalk , though this is done of course when the weather permits , not in the winter snow . And we also hold a small contract for bricks for the restoration of certain fortifications above the Dnieper . Yes , I would expect you to keep track of orders received and , to be sure , of the exact number of bricks manufactured as well as those carted out . These figures you will get from Proshko , but there are ways of checking . You will also send out statements requesting payment and enter payments received in the ledger . Once or twice weekly you will turn over bank drafts and other monies to me , and in the meantime keep them safe in the strongbox . Proshko will of course retain the responsibilities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect him to place all orders for supplies through48 49you . You will also make out the wages inventory and pay the workers at the end of the month . " Though beset by self-doubt and every kind of fear , Yakov was thinking this might be his important chance . A few months ' experience at this kind of work and other opportunities might open up for him . " I 'll think it over carefully , " he said , but before Nikolai Maximovitch had descended the stairs , he had accepted . The landlord returned with a vodka bottle to wet the bargain . Yakov had two drinks and his uneasiness wore off . He was preparing himself for a better future , he told himself . He slept for a while on the floor and later finishedthe last of the woodwork , once more uneasy . It was nightfall . After he had swept and cleaned up , soaked the paintbrushes in turpentine , and washed , he heard Zina limping up the stairs . She was wearing a dress of blue silk , her hair up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips delicately rouged . She invited Yakov to eat with her again . " In celebration of the completion of your fine work , and most of all , to your future relationship with Papa , though he has already retired and we shall be alone . " He had the old excuses , was even a little irritated by the invitation and wanted to escape , but she would not hear of it . " Come , Yakov Ivanovitch , there 's more to life than work . " It was news to him . Still , he thought , the job 's done here and this is the last I 'll see of her . So what 's wrong with farewell ? On the kitchen table Zina had laid out a feast , even some food he had never seen before . There were stuffed cucumbers , raw Danube herring , fat sausages , pickled sturgeon with mushrooms , assorted meats , wine , cakes and cherry brandy . The fixer , overwhelmed by the spread , felt at first self-conscious . If you 've had nothing you 're afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungrily those things he had eaten before . He sucked the red wine through delicious chunks of white bread . Zina , open and happy , and looking more attractive than he had ever seen , picked here and there at sweet and spicy things and filled her wineglass often . Her sharp face was flushed , she talked about herself and laughed at nothing at all . Although he tried to think of her as possiblya friend she remained strange to him . He was strange to himself . Once , staring at the white tablecloth , he thought of Raisl but put her out of his mind . He finishedthe meal  --  he had never in his life eaten so much  --  with two glasses of brandy , and only then began to enjoy the " party . " When she cleared the table Zina 's breath was heavy . She brought out a guitar , plucked it , and in a high thin voice sang , " Ech , my pack is heavy . " It was a sad song and filled him with mild melancholy . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen was warm and it was pleasant to sit there listening to the guitar . Then she sang , " Come on , come on , my darling angel , come and dance with me . " When she put down her guitar , Zina looked at him in a way she never had before . Yakov understoodat once where they were . Excitement and forebodingflowed into one feeling . No , he thought , it 's a Russian woman . If she slept with me and found out who I was she 'd cut her throat . Then he thought , it 's not always so , there are some who would n't mind . For himself he was willing to experience what there was to experience . But let her lead . " Yakov Ivanovitch , " Zina said , pouring herself anotherglassful of wine which she at once drank down , " do you believe in romantic love ? I ask because I think you guard yourself against it . " " Whether I do or do n't it does n't come easily to me . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Zina said , " but it seems to me that those who are serious50 51about life  --  perhaps too serious  --  are slow to respond to certain changes in the climate of feeling . What I mean to say , Yakov Ivanovitch , is that it 's possible to let love fly by like a cloud in a windy sky if one is too timid , or perhaps unable to believe he is entitled to good for-tune . " " It 's possible , " he said . " Do you love me  --  just a little , Yakov Ivanovitch ? " she asked quickly . " I 've sometimes noticed you looking at me as though you might . For instance , you smiled at me quite delightfully a few minutes ago , and it warmed my heart . I dare ask because you yourself are very modest and tend to be conscious  --  overconscious , I would say  --  that we are from different classes , though I believe much alike as people . " " No , " he said . " I ca n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluttered . After a long minutes he sighed and said in a smaller voice , " Very well , then , do you like me at all ? " " Yes , you have been kind to me . " " And I like you too , indeed I do . I think you are seriousand a well-informed person . " " No , I am half an ignoramus . " She poured herself some cherry brandy , sipped from the glass and put it down . " Oh , Yakov Ivanovitch , please for a moment let up on your seriousness and kiss me . I dare you to kiss me . " They got up and kissed . She groped for him , her body clinging tightly to his . He felt for an instant an anguishedpity for her . " Shall we stay here longer ? " she whispered , breathing heavily , " or would you care to visit my room ? You 've seen Papa 's but not mine . " She looked him full in the face , her green eyes lit dark , her body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , possibly twenty-eight or nine , someone used to looking out for herself . " Whatever you say . " " What do you say , Yakov Ivanovitch ? " " Zinaida Nikolaevna , " he said , " excuse me for asking you this question but I do n't want to make a serious mistake . I 've made my share of them  --  every kind you can think of  --  but there are some I do n't want to make again . If you are innocent , " he said awkwardly , " it would be better not to go any further . I say this out of respect for you . " Zina reddened , then shrugged and said frankly , " I 'm as innocent as most , no more nor less . There 's nothing to worry about in that regard . " Then she laughed selfconsciouslyand said , " I see you 're an old-fashioned personand I like that , although your question to me was hardly discreet . " " If one why not another ? What about your father ? What I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out if we go to your room ? " " He never has , " she said . He was momentarily surprised at her answer and then accepted it without another question . Why wrestle with a fact ? They went silently along the corridor , Zina hobbling , Yakov tiptoeing behind her , to her perfumed bedroom . The Pekinese , lying on the bed , looked at the fixer and yawned . Zina picked it up and went again down the hall to lock it in the kitchen . Her room was full of knickknacks on numerous small tables , and pictures of kerchiefed girls on the wall . Peacockfeathers stuck out from behind the frame of a mirror . In the corner of the room hung an ikon of the Holy Mother with a small red oil lamp lighted before it . Should I stay or should I go ? Yakov thought . On the one hand it 's been a long season without rain . A man is52 53not a man for nothing . What do the Hasidim say ? " Hide not from thine own flesh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? At my age it 's nothing new . It means nothing . When she returned he was sitting on the bed . He had taken off his shirt and undershirt . Yakov watched uneasily as Zina , after removing her shoes , knelt at the ikon , crossed herself , and for a momentprayed . " Are you a believer ? " she asked . " No . " " I wish you were , Yakov Ivanovitch , " she sighed . Then she rose and asked him to undress in the lavatorywhile she got ready in the bedroom . It 's her leg , he thought . She 'll be under covers when I come in . Better that way . He removed his clothes in the lavatory . His hands still stank of paint and turpentine , and he soaped them twice with her pink bar of perfumed soap . He smelled them again but now they stank of the perfume . If there 's a mistake to make I 'll make it , he thought . Seeing himself naked in the mirror he was at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Things are bad enough , so why make them worse ? This is n't for me , I 'm not the type , and the sooner I tell her the better . He went into the bedroom , carrying his clothes . Zina had braided her hair . She stood naked , her bosom full , sponging herself from a white bowl , in the gaslight . He saw a dribble of bright blood run down her crippled leg and said , stupefied . " But you are unclean ! " " Yakov !  --  You startled me . " She covered herself with the wet cloth . " I thought you would wait till I called you . " " I did n't know your condition . Excuse me , I had noidea . You did n't mention it , though I realize it 's per-sonal . " " But surely you know this is the safest time ? " Zina said . " And there 's no inconvenience to speak of , the flow stops the minute we begin . " " Excuse me , some can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife 's modesty during her periodand until she had been to the baths , but could not say that to Zina . " Excuse me , I 'd better be going . " " I 'm a lonely woman , Yakov Ivanovitch , " she cried , " have mercy a little ! " but he was already dressing and soon left. 3One night in the dead of winter , in the cold thick dark at 4 A.M. , after the drivers Serdiuk and Richter had come for two teams of horses  --  leaving six horses in the stalls  --  and he had heard them clomp out of the stable and clack dully across the snow-covered cobblestones , Yakov , who had been two days in the brickyard , got quickly out of bed , lit a short candle and hurriedly dressed . He sneaked down the outer stairs from his room above the stable and went along the fence of palings , past the squat brickkilnsto the cooling shed . Motionless in the wet cold , he watched the drivers and their helpers , in steaming sheepskins , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large heavy yellow bricks . The work progressed slowly , helper tossing a brick to helper , who tossed it to the driver on the wagon , who laid it in place . After what seemed to him an endless time standing in the dark , blowing on his hands and tryingsoundlessly to stamp the cold out of his boots , Yakov had counted three hundred and forty bricks loaded into54 55one wagon , and four hundred and three into another . Three other wagons at the shed went unused . But in the morning when Proshko , the foreman , presented him with the voucher in the stuffy low-ceilinged shack where Yakov sat at a table stacked with ledgers and bundles of useless papers from the past , the badly written numbers scrawled on a torn piece of wrapping paper came to a total of six hundred ten bricks , instead of seven hundred forty-three , and the fixer ground his teeth in anger at the cold-blooded nerve of the thievery . Though Yakov was desperately eager for work , he had reluctantly accepted Nikolai Maximovitch 's offer , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he learned that the Lukianovsky , where the brickyard was located  --  near a cemetery , with a few houses and trees scattered around and beyond it , more heavily on the faroffside about half a tombstoned verst away  --  and where he was expected to live , was a district forbidden to Jews to reside in . He had then told the owner of the brickworksthat he would not take the job because he had many doubts he could do the work as it should be done . But Nikolai Maximovitch , advising him not to be hasty , had pooh-poohed his doubts . " Nonsense , you will do better than you suppose . You must learn to have confidence in your natural abilities , Yakov Ivanovitch . Just follow my late brother 's method with the ledger  --  old-fashioned but accurate  --  and you will master the system as you go along . " Yet puzzled somewhat , he raised his offer by three rubles a month , and Yakov trying every way to convince himself to take the job , then suggested it would be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Podol  --  he never said where in the district  --  and come to work very early each morning . It was n't too far a walk from where he lived . The electric trolley , which stopped close by the brickyard , did not run after dark . " Unfortunately you wo n't be of much use to me living in the Podol , " said Nikolai Maximovitch . They were talking in the brickyard on a cloudy end-of-January day  --  a pall of black smoke hung over the kilns  --  and NikolaiMaximovitch still wore his Black Hundreds button on his coat , which Yakov , when speaking to him  --  he saw himself unable to detach his eye if once he stared at it  --  had to ignore or look around , for the button loomed large and unsettling . " It is not what goes on here during the workday that worries me so much , " the anti-Semite said , " although I assure you that worries me too ; but I am deeply concerned with what happens in the early morning hours when the wagons are being loaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thief . It 's in the dark when the ghosts are flying and good people are lying abed that he does his dirty work . My late-lamented brother , who had little respect for sleep  --  one must respect it or it will not respect him  --  was here at 3 A.M. in every weather to oversee each and every wagonload . I am not asking you to do the same , Yakov Ivanovitch . That sort of dedicationto a business enterprise is fanatic and in his case led , I am convinced , to my brother 's early death . " Nikolai Maximovitch crossed himself with eyes shut . " But if you were to look in on them in the early morning hours , and also unexpectedly during other loadings , counting off aloud a close estimate of the number of bricks in the trucks , it might tempt them not to overdo it . I expect some thievery  --  humans are humans  --  but of necessity there has to be a limit . It would be impossible for me to get a reasonably just price for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do they steal ? " the fixer had asked . " I suspect the drivers under Proshko 's supervision or connivance . They take out more than they account for . " " Then why do n't you give him the boot ? " 56 " More easily said than done , my dear boy . If I did I would have to shut down the plant . He is an excellent technical man  --  one of the best , my brother used to say . I confess it is not my purpose to catch him thieving . As a religious person I want to keep him from it . And would n't you say it was the more sensible as well as charitablething ? No , let 's arrange it as I say . Take the room above the stable , Yakov Ivanovitch . It 's yours without a single kopek of rent . " Since he had not mentioned the fixer 's papers  --  neitherthe passport necessary for new employment , nor the residence certificate he would need , Yakov uneasily took the chance and accepted the job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a Jew  --  just quietlyinforming Nikolai Maximovitch : " Well , you ought to know what the situation is . You say you like me ; you know I 'm an honest worker and do n't waste the boss 's time , then maybe it wo n't surprise you to hear I was born Jewish and for that reason ca n't live in this district . " But that was of course impossible . Even supposing  --  a fantastic suppose  --  that Nikolai Maximovitch , twoheadedeagle button and all , overlooked the confession in his own interests , still the Lukianovsky was not for Jews , with certain unusual exceptions , and if a poor fixer were exposed as one living there he would be in serious trouble . It was all too complicated . For the first week Yakov was daily on the verge of leaving , escaping from the place , but he stayed on because he had heard from Aaron Latke that counterfeit papers of various kinds were available to prospective buyers at a certain printing establishment in the Podol , for not too large a sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him severe sweats , he decided he ought to keep it in mind . When Proshko brought in the voucher the morning after Yakov had spied on the drivers loading the wagons , though the fixer 's heart beat loudly when he saw the57false figure on the paper , he informed the foreman that Nikolai Maximovitch had told him to be present at night when the wagons were loaded , and since it was his responsibility , he would be there from now on . Proshko , a burly , thick-eared man with a rough beard , who wore high rubber boots muddy with yellow clay and a long dirty leather apron , gazed at the fixer with intense small eyes . " What do you think goes on in the wagons at night ? Are the drivers on their knees fucking their mothers ? " " What goes on goes on , " said Yakov nervously , " but the number of bricks that you loaded last night and this figure on your paper do n't agree , if you 'll excuse me for saying so . " He then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it possible to say it differently to a thief ? " How would you know how many bricks were loaded ? " " I stood near the shed last night , counting them , according to Nikolai Maximovitch 's direction . In other words , I did as he told me . " His voice was thick with emotion , as though the bricks belonged to him , although the strange thing was they belonged to an anti-Semitic Russian . " Then you counted wrong , " Proshko said , " this is the number we loaded . " He tapped a thick finger on the paper on the table . " Listen , my friend , when a dog puts his nose into shit , he gets it dirty . You have a long nose , Dologushev . If you do n't believe me look in a mirror . A man with a nose like that ought to be careful where he puts it . " He left the shack but returned in the afternoon . " What about your papers , " he said , " have you registered them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll have them stamped by the District Police . " " I 'm obliged to you , " Yakov said , " but that 's already58 59been seen to and done . Nikolai Maximovitch took care of it . You do n't have to trouble yourself . " " Tell me , Dologushev , " said Proshko , " why is it you talk Russian like a Turk ? " " And what if I am a Turk ? " The fixer smiled crookedly . " He who runs too fast raises the wind against him . " Lifting his leg Proshko farted . Afterwards Yakov felt too uneasy to eat supper . I 'm the wrong man to be a policeman , he thought . It 's a job for a goy . Yet he did what he was asked to . He appeared in the shed every morning in the 4 A.M. cold and counted the bricks in the wagons . And when he looked out the shack window and saw them loading up during the daylight hours , he went outside to watch . He did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared at the shed , no one spoke but the drivers sometimesstopped their work to stare at him . Proshko no longer turned in vouchers each morning , so Yakov wrote his own . The bookkeeping was not so difficult as he had thought  --  he had caught on to the system , and besides there was n't that much business . Once a week Nikolai Maximovitch , more drearily melancholic , arrived by sledge for receipts to be deposited in his bank , and after a month Yakov received a long congratulatoryletter from him . " Your work is diligent and effective , as I foresaw , and I shall continue to vest in you my utmost confidence . Zinaida Nikolaevna sends her regards . She too applauds your efforts . " But no one else did . Neither the drivers nor their helpers paid any attention to him , even when he tried to make conversation . Richter , the heavy-faced German , spat in the snow at his approach , and Serdiuk , a tall Ukrainian who smelled of horse sweat and hay , watched him , breathing heavily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Bastardstool pigeon ! " Yakov pretended not to hear . If he heard " Jew " he would dive into the sky . Except for these he was on more or less decent terms with the other workers in the yard  --  he paid them on time , about fifty left from almost two hundred employed when the yard had turned out six or seven thousand bricks a day  --  and this was so despite the fact that Proshko was spreading nasty stories about him ; one that Skobeliev , the yardkeeper , had told him was that the fixer had once done time as a convicted thief . But no one sought him out as friend or kept him company when the brickyard was closed , so he was mostly alone . After work Yakov stayed in his room . He read by lamplight  --  though Nikolai Maximovitch had promised to install an electric bulb  --  for hours each night . His reading in the past was what he had accidentally come across ; he now read what he wanted to know . He continued to study Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he devoured two newspapers every day , though they often gave him the shivers , both things reportedas fact , and things hinted at ; for instance , Rasputinand the Empress , new plots of terrorists , threats of pogroms , and the possibility of a Balkan war . So much was new to him , how is one to know all he ought to know ? He began then to haunt the bookshops in the Podol in his free time , searching for inexpensive books . He bought a Life of Spinoza to read during the lonely nights in his stable room . Was it possible to learn from another 's life ? And Russian history fascinated him . He went through stacks of pamphlets on the shelves in the rear of the shops . He read some on serfdom , the Siberian penal system  --  a terrifying account he had found in a bushel the bookseller had winked at . He read about the revolt and destruction of the Decembrists , and a fascinatingaccount of the Narodniki , idealists of the 187o 's who had devoted themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social revolution , were rebuffed by them , and turned from peasant-mysticism to terrorism . Yakov also read a short biography of Peter the Great , and after that a horrifying account of the bloody destruction of Novgorod by Ivan the Terrible . It had entered the madman 's head that the city intended treasonto him , so he had ordered a wooden wall built around it to prevent escape . Then he marched in with his army , and after putting his subjects through the cruelest tortures , daily slaughtered thousands of them . This went on in increasing savagery , the sound of horror rising to the sky as the wailing mothers watched their children being roasted alive and thrown to wild dogs . At the end of five weeks , sixty thousand people , maimed , torn , broken apart , lay dead in the foul-smelling streets as disease spread . Yakov was sickened . Like a pogromthevery worst . The Russians make pogroms against the Russians  --  it went on throughout their history . What a sad country , he thought , amazed by what he had read , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and black was black ; and if the Russians , too , were massacred by their own rulers and died like flies , who were then the Chosen People ? Fatigued by history , he went back to Spinoza , rereading chapters on biblical criticism , superstition , and miracles which he knew almostby heart . If there was a God , after reading Spinoza he had closed up his shop and become an idea . When he was n't reading , Yakov was composing little essays on a variety of subjects  --  " I am in history , " he wrote , " yet not in it . In a way of speaking I 'm far out , it passes me by . Is this good , or is something lacking in my character ? What a question ! Of course lacking but what can I do about it ? And besides is this really such a great worry ? Best to stay where one is , unless he has something to give to history , like for instance Spinoza , as I read in his life . He understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nobody can burn an idea even if they burn the man . On the other hand there was the activist Jan De Witt , Spinoza 's friend and benefactor , a good and great man who was torn to pieces by a Dutch mob when they got suspicious of him although he was innocent . Who needs such a fate ? " Some of the little essays were criticisms of " Certain Conditions " as he had read about them in the newspapers . He read these over and burned them in the stove . He also burned the pamphlets he could not resell . Something that unexpectedly bothered him was that he was no longer using his tools . He had built himself a bed , table , and chair , also some shelves on the wall , but this was done in the first few days after he had come to the brickyard . He was afraid that if he did n't go on carpenteringhe might forget how and thought he had betternot . Then he got another letter , this from Zina , her handwriting full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's permission  --  to call on her . " You are a sensitive person , Yakov Ivanovitch , " she wrote , " and I respect your ideals and mode of behavior ; however , please do n't worry about your clothes , although I am sure you can purchase new ones with the improved salary you are earning . " He had sat down to reply but could n't think what to say to her , so he did n't answer the letter . In February he went through a period of severe nervousness . He blamed it on his worries . He had visited the place where he could get counterfeit papers , had found they were not impossibly expensive although they were not inexpensive , and he was thinking of having a passportand residence certificate made out under his assumedname . When he awoke , hours before he had to , to check the number of bricks in the trucks his muscles were tight , his chest constricted , breathing sometimes painful , and he was uneasy when he dealt with Proshko. 62 63Even to ask him the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and cursed himself for triflingmistakes in his accounts , a matter of a kopek or two . Once , at nightfall , he drove two boys out of the brickyard . He knew them as troublemakers , one a pale-faced pimply boy of about twelve , the other like a peasant with a head of hair like hay , about the same age . They came into the yard after school , in the late afternoon , and pitched balls of clay at each other , broke good bricks , and hooted at the horses in the stable . Yakov had warned them to stay out of the yard . This time he caught sight of them through the shack window . They had sneaked into the yard with their book satchels and threw rocks at the smoke curling up from the kilns . Then they hit the chimneys with pieces of brick . Yakov had rushed out of the shack , warning them to leave , but they would n't move . He ran towards them to scare them . Seeing him coming , the boys hooted , touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supplysheds and scrambled up a pile of broken bricks at the fence . They tossed their book satchels over the fence and hopped over it . " Little bastards ! " Yakov shouted , shaking his fist . Returning to the shack , he noticed Skobeliev watching him slyly . Then the yardkeeper hurried with his stick to light the gas lamps . After a while they glowed in the dusk like green candles . Proshko , standing at the door of the cooling shed , had also been looking on . " You run like a ruptured pig , Dologushev . " The next morning a police inspector visited the fixer to ask if anyone in the brick factory was suspected of politicalunreliability . The fixer said no one was . The officialasked him a few more questions and left . Yakov was not able to concentrate on his reading that night . Since he was sleeping badly he tried going to bed justafter he had eaten . He fell asleep quickly enough but awoke before midnight , totally alert , with a sense of being imperiled . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day  --  the stable in flames , burning down with him in it , bound hand and foot unable to move ; and the maddened horses destroyingthemselves . Or dying of consumption , or syphilis , coughing up or pissing blood . And he dreaded what worried him most  --  to be unmasked as a hidden Jew . " Gevalt ! " he shouted , then listened in fright for sounds in the stable to tell him whether the drivers were there and had heard him cry out . Once he dreamed that Richter , carrying a huge black bag on his back , was following him down the road by the graveyard . When the fixer turned to confront the German and asked him what he was carrying in the bag , the driver winked and said , " You . " So Yakov ordered and paid for the counterfeit papers , though weeks went by and he did not claim them . Then for no reason he could think of he began to feel better . He went through a more confident period , when for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing more than money . He bought more books , paper to write on , tobacco , a pair of shoes to relieve him from boots , a luxurious jar of strawberry jam , and a kilo of flour to bake bread with . The bread did not rise but he baked it and ate it as biscuit . He also bought a pair of socks , a set of drawers and undershirt , and an inexpensiveblouse , only what was necessary . One night , feeling an overwhelming hunger for sweets , he entered a candy store to sip cocoa and eat cakes . And he bought himself a thick bar of chocolate . When he counted his rubles later , he had spent more than he had bargained for and it worried him . So he returned to frugality . He lived on black bread , sour cream and boiled potatoes , an occasionalegg , and when he was tempted , a small piece of64 halvah . He repaired his socks and patched his old shirts - until there was nowhere he had n't made a stitch . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he mut- tered . He had serious plans . One night in April when the thick ice of the Dnieper was cracking , and Yakov  --  after selling the books he had recently bought and afterwards wandering in the Plos- sky District  --  was returning late to the brickyard , it began to snow unexpectedly . Coming up the hill ap- proaching the cemetery , he saw some boys attacking an old man and scattered them with a shout . They ran like frightened rabbits through the graveyard . The old man was a Jew , a Hasid wearing a caftan to his ankles , a round rabbinic hat with a fur brim , and long white stockings . He slowly bent and retrieved from the snow a small black satchel tied with brown twine . He had been hurt on the temple and the blood dripped down his hairy cheek into his tousled two-forked gray beard . His eyes were dazed . " What happened to you , grandfather ? " the fixer said in Russian . The Hasid , frightened , backed off , but Yakov waited and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from Minsk to see a sick brother in the Jewish quarter and had got lost . Then some boys had attacked him with snowballs embedded with sharp stones . The streetcars were no longer running , and the snow was falling in thick wet flakes . Yakov was uneasily wor- ried but thought he could take the old man into the brickyard , let him rest while he applied some cold water to his wound , then get him out before the drivers and their helpers came in . " Come with me , grandfather . " " Where are you taking me ? " said the Hasid . " We 'll wipe the blood off you , and when the snow stops I 'll show you which way to the Jewish quarter in the Podol . " He led the Hasid into the brickyard and up the stairs to his room above the stable . After lighting the lamp , Yakov tore up his most tattered shirt , wet it , and wiped the blood off the old man 's beard . The wound was still bleeding but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chair with his eyes shut , breathing as though he were whispering . Yakov offered him bread and a glass of sweetened tea but the Hasid would not accept food . He was a dignified man with long earlocks and asked the fixer for some water . Pouring a little over his fingers over a bowl , he then withdrew a small packet from his caftan pocket , some matzo pieces wrapped in a handkerchief . He said the blessing for matzos , and sighing , munched a piece . It came as a surprise to the fixer that it was Passover . He was moved by a strong emotion and had to turn away till it had gone . When he looked out the window the snow was still falling but there were signs of a moon , a circle of dim light within the falling snow . It 'll soon stop , he thought , but it did n't . The glow disappeared and once more it was dark and snowy . Yakov thought he would wait till the drivers arrived , quickly count the bricks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the wagonshad left and before Proshko came . If the snow did n't stop , the old man would have to leave anyway . The Hasid slept in the chair , woke , stared at the lamp , then at the window and slept again . When the drivers opened the stable door he awoke and looked at Yakov , but the fixer made a sign for silence and left to go down to the shed . He had offered the Hasid his bed but when he returned the old man was sitting up awake . The drivers had loaded the wagons and were waiting in the shed for daylight . They had wrapped chains around the horses ' hooves but Serdiuk had said if the snow got deeper they would not leave the yard . Now Yakov was worried. 661 67In his room , huddled in his sheepskin coat , he stood watching the snow , then rolled and smoked a cigarette and made himself a glass of tepid tea . He drank a little , fell asleep on his bed , and dreamed he had encountered the Hasid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why are you hiding here ? " and the fixer had struck him a blow on the head with a hammer . It was a terrible dream and gave him a headache . He awoke to find the old man staring at him , and his nervousness returned . " What 's wrong ? " he asked . " What 's wrong is wrong , " said the old man . " But now the snow has stopped . " " Did I say anything in my sleep ? " " I was n't listening . " The sky had lightened and it was time to go , but the Hasid dipped the tips of his fingers into water , then unknottedthe twine around his satchel , opened it , and removed a large striped prayer shawl . From the pocket of his caftan he took out a phylactery bag . " Where is the east ? " asked the old man . Yakov impatiently indicated the wall with the window . Saying the blessing for phylacteries , the Hasid slowly wound one around his left arm , the other on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wound . He covered his head with the capacious prayer shawl , blessing it , then prayed at the wall , rocking back and forth . The fixer waited with his eyes shut . When the old man had said his morning prayers , he removed the shawl , folded it carefully and put it away . He unbound the phylacteries , kissed them , and packed them away . " May God reward you , " he said to Yakov . " I 'm much obliged but let 's move on . " The fixer was sweating in his cold clothes . Asking the old man to wait a minute , he went down the snow-laden stairs and walked around the stable . Theyard was white and still , the roofs of the kilns covered with snow . But the wagons , though loaded with bricks , had not yet left and the drivers were still in the shed . Yakov hurried up the stairs and got the Hasid and his satchel . They hastened through the spring snow to the gate . He led the old Hasid down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting a sledge with tinkling bells drove by . Yakov hailed it and the sleepy driver promised he would take the Jew to his street in the Podol . When Yakov got back to the brickyard he felt he had been through a long night . He felt out of sorts and unreasonably depressed . On the way to the stable he met Proshko in high spirits . When he entered his room Yakov had the sudden feelingthat someone had been in it while he was out with the Hasid . He had the impression things had been moved , then set back not exactly in place . He suspected the foreman . The smell of horse manure and rotting hay seeped up from the stable . He hastily searched among his few possessions but could find nothing missing , neitherhousehold articles , his few books , nor rubles in the tin can . He was glad he had sold some of the books and burned the pamphlets ; they were about history but some history was dangerous . The next day he heard that a body had been found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a newspaper account of the terriblemurder of a twelve-year-old boy who had lived in one of the wooden houses near the cemetery . The body was found in a sitting position , the boy 's hands tied behind his back . He was clad in his underwear , without shoes , one black stocking hanging on his left foot ; scatterednearby were a bloodstained blouse , a schoolboy 's cap , a belt , and several pencil-smeared copy books . Both the Kievlyanin and Kievskaya Mysl carried a picture of him , Zhenia Golov , and Yakov recognized the pimplyfacedboy he had chased out of the yard with his friend. 68One newspaper said the boy had been dead for a week , the other said two . When the Police Inspector had examined his swollen face and shrunken mutilated body , he had counted thirty-seven wounds made by a thin pointed instrument . The boy , according to Professor Y. A. Cherpunov of the Kiev Anatomical Institute , had been stabbed to death and bled white , " possibly for religiouspurposes . " Marfa Vladimirovna Golov , the bereavedmother , a widow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a picture of her in both newspapers , pressing the boy 's poor head to her grief-stricken bosom , crying desolately , " Tell me , Zheniushka , who did this to my baby ? " That night the river overflowed its banks , flooding the lower reaches of the city . Two days later the boy was buried in the cemetery , a few short steps from his home . Yakov could see from the window of his stable the trees still powdered with April snow , and wandering amid them and the thin tombstones , the black crowd , among them some pilgrims with staves . When the coffin was lowered into the grave , hundreds of leaflets exploded into the air : WE ACCUSE THE JEWS . A week later the Kiev Union of Russian People , together with members of the Society of the Double-headed Eagle , placed a huge wooden cross on the grave of the boy  --  Yakov watching from afar  --  at the same time calling on all good Christians , according to the newspapers that night , to preach a new crusade against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our lives and country ! People of Russia ! Have pity on your children ! Avenge the unfortunate martyrs ! " This is terrible , Yakov thought , they want to start a pogrom . In the brickyard Proshko sported a Black Hundreds button on his leather apron . Very early the next morning the fixer hurried to the printer 's for his counterfeit papers but when he arrived he found the place had burned down . He ran back to the stable and69hastily counted his rubles to see if he had enough to get to Amsterdam and possibly New York . Wrapping up his few things , and slinging his bag of tools onto his shoulder , he was on his way down the stairs when a man who identified himself as Colonel I. P. Bodyansky , the redmustachedhead of the Secret Police in Kiev , with sev-eralother officials , fifteen gendarmes wearing white looped cords across the breasts of their uniforms , a detachmentof police , several plainclothes detectives , and two representatives of the Office of the Chief ProsecutingAttorney of the District Superior Court , about thirty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swords , confronting the fleeing Yakov . " In the name of His Majesty Nicholas the Second , " said the red-headed colonel , " I arrest you . Resist and you are dead . " The fixer readily confessed he was a Jew . Otherwise he was innocent . IIIIn a long , high-ceilinged cell under the District Courthouse , a dismal faded stucco structure in the commercial section of the Plossky a few versts from the brickyard in the Lukianovsky , Yakov , in a state of unrelieved distress , could not blot out the sight of himself marching manacledbetween two tall columns of gendarmes on horses , their sabers drawn and spurs clinking as they hurried him along snowy streets tracked slushy by sledge runners . He had begged the colonel to let him walk on the sidewalk to lessen his embarrassment , but was forced into the wet center of the street , and people on their way to work had stopped to watch . They gazed at first qui-72etly , then in deep silence , broken by whispers , mutteringand a few jeers . Most seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a uniformed schoolboy in a blue cap and silver-buttoned coat , poking his fingers up like horns over his head , danced in the snow behind the prisoner , chanting , " Zhid , Zhid , " and that awoke murmurs , hoots , mockery . A small crowd , including some women , began to follow them , jeering at the fixer , calling him dirty names , " murdering Jew . " He wanted to break and run but did n't dare . Someone flung a block of wood at him but it struck a horse that broke into a wild gallop , kicking up snow and running two squares before it was controlled . Then the colonel , a huge man in a fur cap , raised his saber and the crowd scattered . He delivered the prisoner first to Secret Police Headquarters , a one-story brown building in a side street ; then after a long annoyed telephone conversation , fragments of which the frightened prisoner sitting on a bench in an anteroom surrounded by gendarmes , overheard , the colonel escorted Yakov directly to an undergroundcell in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corridor with naked sabers . Yakov , alone in the cell , wringing his hands , cried out , " My God , what have I done to myself ? I 'm in the hands of enemies ! " He hit his chest with his fist , bewailedhis fate , envisioned terrible things happening to him , ending by being torn apart by a mob . Yet there were also moments of sudden hope when he felt that if he only explained why he had done what he had done , he would be at once released . He had stupidly pretended to be somebody he was n't , hoping it would create " opportunities , " had learned otherwise  --  the wrong opportunities  --  and was paying for learning . If they let him go now he had suffered enough . He blamed also egotism and foolish ambition , considering who he was , and73promised himself it would be different in the future . He had learned his lesson  --  again . Then he jumped up and cried aloud , " What future ? " but nobody answered . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not eat though he had eaten nothing that day . As the day wore on he groaned often , tore his hair with both fists , and knocked his head repeatedly against the wall . A gendarme saw him and strictly forbade it . Towards evening , the prisoner , sitting immobile on a thin mattress on the floor , heard footsteps in the corridor other than the measured tread of the armed guard who had replaced the two gendarmes . Yakov scrambled to his feet . A man of medium height carrying a black hat and fur coat hurried along the dimly lit corridor to the dark cell . He ordered the guard to open the cell door , lock him in with the prisoner , and leave . The guard hesi- tated . The man waited patiently . " I was ordered not to leave , if it 's all the same to your honor , " said the guard . " The Prosecuting Attorney said not to let the Jew out of my sight because it 's a most important case . That 's what I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on official business and will call you when I need you . Wait outside the corridor door . " The guard reluctantly opened the cell , locked the man in with Yakov and left . The man watched till the guard had gone , then took a candle stub out of his coat pocket , lit it and set it in some drops of wet wax in a saucer . He held the saucer in his hand , studying Yakov for a long moment , then put it down on the table in the cell . Seeing his cold breath in the light he drew on his fur coat . " I am subject to lingering colds . " He wore a dark- ish beard , pince-nez , and a thick scarf wrapped around his neck . Facing the fixer , who was standing stiffly at at- tention , inwardly trembling , he introduced himself in a quiet resonant voice. 74 751 " I am B. A. Bibikov , Investigating Magistrate for Cases of Extraordinary Importance . Please kindly identifyyourself . " " Yakov Shepsovitch Bok , your honor , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are not Yakov Ivanovitch Dologushev ? " " That was a stupid deception . I admit it at once . " Bibikov adjusted his glasses and looked at him in silence . He lifted the candle to light a cigarette , then changed his mind , set it down , and thrust the cigarette into his pocket . " Tell me truly , " said the Investigating Magistrate in a severe voice , " did you murder that unfortunate child ? " A fog of blackness rose before Yakov 's eyes . " Never ! Never ! " he cried hoarsely . " Why would I kill an innocent child ? How could I have done it ? For years I wanted a child but my luck was bad and my wife could n't have one . If in no other way at least in my heart I 'm a father . And if that 's so how could I kill an innocentchild ? I could n't think of such a thing , I 'd rather be dead . " " How long have you been married ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not really marriednow because my wife left me . " " Is that so ? Why did she leave you ? " " To make it short and simple she was unfaithful . She ran off with an unknown party and that 's why I 'm in jail now . If she had n't done that I would have stayed where I belonged , which means where I was born . This very minute I 'd be sitting down to supper , such as it was , but it could have been worse . When the sun went down , whether I had earned a kopek or not , I headed straight for my hut . It was n't such a bad place to be , now that I think of it . " " You 're not from Kiev ? " " Not the city , the province . I left my village a fewmonths after my wife left me and I 've been here since November . I was ashamed to stay on there with things as they were . There were other reasons but that was what bothered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was fed up with my work  --  no work at all . And I hoped , with a bit of luck , to get myself a little education . They say in America there are schools where a grown man can study at night . " " You were thinking of emigrating to America ? " " It was one of my thoughts , your honor , though I 've had many such and they 've all come to nothing . Still in all , I 'm a loyal subject of the Tsar . " The Investigating Magistrate found the cigarette in his pocket and lit it . He smoked silently , standing on the other side of the table , still studying Yakov 's tormented face in the candlelight . " I saw among your possessions when you were arrested a few books , among others a volume of selected chapters from the work of the philosopher Spinoza . " " That 's right , your honor . Could I get them back ? I 'm also worried about my tools . " " In due course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writings ? " " Only in a way of speaking , " said the fixer , worried by the question . " Although I 've read the book I do n't understand it all . " " What is its appeal to you ? First let me ask you what brought you to Spinoza ? Is it that he was a Jew ? " " No , your honor . I did n't know who or what he was when I first came across the book  --  they do n't exactly love him in the synagogue , if you 've read the story of his life . I found it in a junkyard in a nearby town , paid a kopek and left cursing myself for wasting money hard to come by . Later I read through a few pages and kept on going as though there were a whirlwind at my back . As Isay , I did n't understand every word but when you 're dealing with such ideas you feel as though you were taking a witch 's ride . After that I was n't the same man . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've changed little since my youth . " Though he had answered freely , talking about a book with a Russian official frightened the fixer . He 's testing me , he thought . Still when all 's said and done , better questions about a book than a murdered child . I 'll tell the truth but speak slowly . " Would you mind explaining what you think Spinoza'swork means ? In other words if it 's a philosophy what does it state ? " " That 's not so easy to say , " Yakov answered apologetically . " The truth is I 'm a half-ignorant man . The other half is half-educated . There 's a lot I miss even when I pay the strictest attention . " " I will tell you why I ask . I ask because Spinoza is among my favorite philosophers and I am interested in his effect on others . " " In that case , " said the fixer , partly relieved , " I 'll tell you that the book means different things according to the subject of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I think it means is that he was out to make a free man out of himself  --  as much as one can according to his philosophy , if you understand my meaning  --  bythinking things through and connecting everythingup , if you 'll go along with that , your honor . " " That is n't a bad approach , " said Bibikov , " through the man rather than the work . But you ought to explain the philosophy a little . " " Who knows if I can , " the fixer said . " Maybe it 's that God and Nature are one and the same , and so is man , or some such thing , whether he 's poor or rich . If you understand that a man 's mind is part of God , then you understand it as well as I. In that way you 're free , ifyou 're in the mind of God . If you 're there you know it . At the same time the trouble is that you are bound down by Nature , though that 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also something called Necessity , which is always there though nobody wants it , that one has to push against . In the shtetl God goes running around with the Law in both hands , but this other God , though he fills up more space , has less to do altogether . Whoever you end up believing in , nothing has changed much in the world if you 're without work . So much for Necessity . I also figure it means that life is life and there 's no sense kicking it into the grave . Either that or I do n't understand it as well as it 's said . " " If a man is bound to Necessity where does freedom come from ? " " That 's in your thought , your honor , if your thought is in God . That 's if you believe in this kind of God ; that 's if you reason it out . It 's as though a man flies over his own head on the wings of reason , or some such thing . You join the universe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one can be free that way ? " " Up to a point , " Yakov sighed . " It sounds fine but my experience is limited . I have n't lived much outside the small towns . " The magistrate smiled . Yakov snickered but caught himself and stopped . " Is such a thing as you describe it , true freedom , would you say , or can not one be free without being politicallyfree ? " Here 's where I 'd better watch my step , the fixer thought . Politics is politics . No use fanning up hot coals when you have to walk across them . " I would n't know for sure , your honor . It 's partly one and partly the other . " " True enough . One might say there is more than one conception of freedom in Spinoza 's mind  --  in Necessity , 78 79philosophically speaking ; and practically , in the state , that is to say within the realm of politics and political action . Spinoza conceded a certain freedom of political choice , similar to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make these choices . At least it is possible to think them . He perhaps felt that the purpose of the state  --  the government  --  was the security and comparativefreedom of rational man . This was to permit man to think as best he could . He also thought man was freer when he participated in the life of society than when he lived in solitude as he himself did . He thought that a free man in society had a positive interest in promoting the happiness and intellectual emancipation of his neighbors . " " I guess that 's true , your honor , if you say so , " said Yakov , " but as far as I myself am concerned what you said is something to think about , though if you 're poor your time is taken up with other things that I do n't have to mention . You let those who can , worry about the ins and outs of politics . " " Ah , " Bibikov sighed . He puffed on his cigarette without speaking . For a moment there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong ? Yakov thought wildly . There are times it does n't pay to open your mouth . When the magistrate spoke again he sounded once more like an investigating official , his tone dry , objective . " Have you ever heard the expression historical neces-sity ' ? " " Not that I remember . I do n't think so though maybe I could guess what it means . " " Are you sure ? You 've not read Hegel ? " " I do n't know his name . " " Or Karl Marx ? He too was a Jew , though not exactly happy to be one . " " Not him either . " " Would you say you have a philosophy ' of your own ? If so what is it ? " " If I have it 's all skin and bones . I 've only just come to a little reading , your honor , " he apologized . " If I have any philosophy , if you do n't mind me saying so , it 's that life could be better than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better if not in politics or through it ? " That 's a sure trap , Yakov thought . " Maybe by more jobs and work , " he faltered . " Not to forget good will among men . We all have to be reasonable or what 's bad gets worse . " " Well , that 's at least a beginning , " the magistrate said quietly . " You must read and reflect further . " " I will just as soon as I get out of here . " Bibikov seemed embarrassed . The fixer felt as though he had disappointed him , although he was not sure why . Probably too much inexact talk . It 's hard to make sense when you 're in trouble , considering also your other naturaldisadvantages . The magistrate after a while absently asked , " How did you bruise your head ? " " In the dark , in desperation . " Bibikov reached into his pocket and offered the fixer his cigarette box . " Have one , they 're Turkish . " Yakov smoked in order not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cigarette . Taking a folded paper and pencil stub out of his suit coat pocket the magistrate placed them on the table , saying , " I leave this questionnaire with you . We will have to know more biographical details since you have no policerecord . When you have answered each question and signed your name , call the guard and give him the paper . Be accurate in everything you say . I 'll leave the candlewith you . " 801 81Yakov stared at the paper . " I have to hurry now . My boy has a fever . My wife gets frantic . " The Investigating Magistrate buttoned his fur coat and put on a wide-brimmed black fedora that looked large for his head . Nodding to the prisoner , he said quietly , " Whatever happens you must have fortitude . " " My God , what can happen ? I 'm an innocent man . " Bibikov shrugged . " It 's a touchy thing . " " Have mercy , your honor ; I 've had little in my life . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The law will protect you . " He called the guard and left the cell . As the door was being locked he hurried away in the dimly lit corridor . The fixer felt at once a sense of intense loss . " When will you come back ? " he shouted after him . " Tomorrow . " A distant door shut . The footsteps were gone . " It 's a long tomorrow , " said the guard. 2The next morning a new guard unlocked the cell , searched Yakov thoroughly for the third time since he had awakened , manacled him tightly with heavy handcuffsattached by a short thick chain , and in the presence of two other armed guards , one of whom cursed the prisonerand prodded him with his pistol , escorted Yakov , about as dead as he was alive , up two flights of narrow booming wooden stairs into the Investigating Magistrate'soffice . In the large anteroom some clerks in uniformsat at long tables scratching on paper with wet pens . They gazed at him with intense interest , then looked at each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bibikov was standing at an open window , waving his hand back and forth to thin out the cigarette smoke . As Yakov entered he quickly shut the window and seated himself in a chair at the head of a long table . The room contained a bulky desk , several shelves of thick books , two large green shaded lamps , and a small ikon in the corner ; on the wall hung a large sepia portraitof Tsar Nicholas II , bemedaled and immaculately barbered , staring critically at the fixer . The picture added to his discomfort . The only other person in the room was Bibikov 's assistant , a pimply-faced man in his thirties , with a thin beard through which his small chin was visible . He was sitting next to the magistrate at the short end of the table , and Yakov was told to take his seat at the other end . The three escorting guards at the magistrate 's requestwaited in the antechamber . He , after barely glancing at the prisoner  --  almost distastefully the fixer thought  --  fished among some official documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one whose pages he thumbed through . He whispered something to the assistant , who filled a heavy fountain pen from a large bottle of black ink , wiped the nib with an ink-stained rag , and began to write quickly in a notebook . Bibikov , looking ill-at-ease and tired , seemed changed from last night , and for a moment Yakov nervously wondered if it was the same man . His head was large , with a broad forehead and a pelt of dark graying hair . As he read he nibbled on his thin underlip ; then he put down the paper , blew at his pince-nez , adjusted them with care and sipped from a glass of water . He spoke in a voice without warmth , addressing the fixer across the table : " I will now read you a portion of the deposition of Nikolai Maximovitch Lebedev , factory owner of the Lukianovsky District ; that is , his factory is in the Lukianovsky  --  " Then his official voice changed and he said quietly , " Yakov Shepsovitch Bok , you are in a difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 83to a statement of the witness Lebedev . He says it was your intent from the outset to deceive him . " " It is n't true , your honor ! " " Just one minute . Please contain yourself . " Bibikov took up the document , turned to an inside page and read aloud : " N. Lebedev : He whom I knew as Yakov Ivanovitch Dologushev , although he did me , by chance , a personal favor of some magnitude , for which I generously rewardedhim , and my daughter treated him most considerately , was a less than honest man  --  more accurately , a deceitful one . He concealed from me , for reasons that are obvious  --  and well he might for I would never have employed him had I known what I do now  --  that he was in truth , although he attempted to hide it , a member of the Jewish Nation . I confess I felt a tremor of suspicion when I observed his discomfiture at a query I addressed him concerning the Holy Scriptures . In response to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Holy Bible , he replied he was familiar only with the Old Testament , and blanched greatly when I proceeded to read him some telling verses from the New Testament , in particular from the Sermon on the Mount . ' " Investigating Magistrate : Anything else ? ' " ' N. Lebedev : I also noticed an odd hesitancy , a sort of bumbling when he spoke his name for the first time , that is to say the assumed name , which he was as yet unfamiliarwith . It did not , need I say , your honor , fit his Jewish tongue . Furthermore , for an ostensibly poor man he showed extreme reluctance  --  perhaps this is to his credit  --  to accept my generous offer of a position in my brickworks , and my suspicions were further aroused because he seemed uneasy when I had broached the matter of his living in the room above the stable on the factory grounds . He wanted to work for me and yet he wasafraid to , naturally enough . He was troubled and nervous , constantly wetting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incapacitated in health  --  my liver gives me trouble and I suffer a marked shortness of breath  --  I had need of an overseer who would live on the premises and see that my affairs were kept in order . However , since the Jew had helped me when I became suddenly ill and collapsed in the snow , my suspicions were not long lasting , and I offered him the position . I believe he knew full well , when he accepted my unwittingoffer , that the Lukianovsky District is sacred territoryand forbidden to Jews for residence , except , as I understand it , for exceptional services to the Crown ; and I take that to be the reason he made no attempt to turn over to me his papers so that I might deliver them to the District Police . ' " Investigating Magistrate : Did you ask for them ? ' " N. Lebedev : Not directly . Yes , perhaps I did once and he made me some sort of fishy Jewish excuse or other , and then as I was having trouble with my health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that and he refused my request , I would at once have ordered him off my property . I am a generous and lenient man , your honor , but I would never have tolerated a Jew in my employ . Please note , if you will , the sigillum on my coat lapel . I consider it a mark of this man 's insolence that he was not quailed by it in my presence . For your information am a former recording secretary of the Society of the Double-headed Eagle . ' " The magistrate laid down the paper , removed his glasses and rubbed his eyes . " You have heard the deposition , " he said to Yakov . " I have also read your questionnaire and am familiar with the responses , but I must now ask you to comment on the remarks of the witness Lebedev . Is the substance of84them correct ? Be careful in your reply . This , though not a trial , is a police investigation to see if an Act of Indictmentis warranted . " Yakov rose in excitement . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the law , and it is n't always simple to say yes and no in the right place . Would you let me speak to a lawyer for advice ? I might even have a few rubles to pay if the police will return my money to me . " " Yes and no take care of themselves if a man tells the truth . As for consulting a lawyer , that is not possible at this stage . In our legal system the indictment comes first . After the preliminary examination the Investigating Magistrate and Prosecuting Attorney consult , and if both believe the suspect to be guilty , an Act of Indictmentis drawn up and sent to the District Court , where it is either confirmed or disapproved by the judges . The defense may begin after the accused is informed that the indictment has been voted , and he is then given a copy of it . Within a week or so , possibly a bit more , the accusedmay select his counsel and inform the court . " " Your honor , " Yakov said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say he did ? What 's it all about is a confusion in my mind . One minute I think it 's as clear as daylight and the crime we 're talking about is a small one , no more than a mistake you might say , and the next minute you say things that make me shiver . For my little sin why should anybody accuse me of a big one ? If I gave a false name to someone does that mean there 's bound to be an indictment ? " " We will know in due course what is bound to be . " The fixer , sighing heavily , sat down , his manacled hands twitching in his lap . " I have asked you to comment on the witness Lebedev'sremarks , " Bibikov said . " Your honor , I give you my word I meant no harm. 85What I did wrong  --  even Nikolai Maximovitch admits it  --  I did with reluctance , against my will . The truth is I found him drunk in the snow . As a reward he offered me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've refused it and I did once or twice , but my money was going fast , I had rent to pay and et cetera . I was getting desperate for work  --  my hands complain when they have nothing to do  --  so I finally took what he offered me . He was satisfied with the paint and papering job I first did , and he also told me I was a good overseer in the brickworks . I used to get up half past three every night to inspect the loading of the wagons . If he said it once he said it more than once . Ask him yourself , your honor . " " True , but did n't you give him a false name as your own ? In effect , a gentile name ? That was no accident I take it ? That was your intent , was n't it ? " The magistrate had forcefully thrust his face forward . Was this the man who said he admired Spinoza ? " It 's my mistake , I admit it , " said Yakov . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my head . I was n't thinking , your honor , and that 's how a man comes to grief . When you 're faced with a worrisome situation it 's not so easy to keep your mind on what comes next . Dologushev is a one-eyed peasant near my village who slaughters pigs . But the truth of it is I really did n't want to live on the factory grounds . It got so I could n't sleep from worrying so much . Nikolai Maximovitch mentions that I was afraid to take his offer to live in the stable . He says so himself in this paper you just read to me . I asked him if I could live in the Podol instead and walk to the job , but he said no , I had to live there . In other words it was n't my idea in the first place . And he 's mistaken if he thinks he asked for my passport . Maybe he thought he did but he did n't . He 's a melancholy man and sometimes vague in his thoughts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 871had , that would have ended it then and there . I would have thought the jig 's up and gone home . It would have saved me a lot of misery . " " Still , you did live in the Lukianovsky , though fully aware it was illegal for you to do so ? " " That 's as you say , your honor , but I did n't want to lose the job . I was hoping for a better life than I had . " His voice had begun to plead , but noticing the magis- trate 's compressed lips and stern gaze , Yakov stopped speaking and inspected his hands . " In the questionnaire , " said Bibikov , snapping on his glasses and consulting another paper , " you state you are a Jew ' by birth and nationality . ' Do I sense a reservation , and if so what is it ? " The fixer sat silent a minute , then looked up uncom- fortably . " What I meant by that is I 'm not a religious man . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I mentioned that when we talked last night , but maybe I did n't . That 's all I meant by that . " " How did it happen ? I refer to your loss of religion . " " I guess there 's more than one reason even though I do n't recall them all . In my life , the way that it 's turned out , I 've had a lot to think about . One thought breeds another . Give me an idea and in two minutes there 's a second pushing out the first . Also I 've been reading a little here and there , as I mentioned to you , your honor , and have picked up a few things I never knew before . It all adds up . " The magistrate leaned back in his chair . " You have n't by some chance been baptized along the way ? It might be convenient if you had . " " Oh , no , your honor , nothing at all like that . What I mean to say is I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a freethinker as- sumes one would know how to think . " " I try my best , " said Yakov . " What do you think freethinker means ? " " A man who decides for himself if he wants to believe in religion . Maybe an agnostic also . Some do and some do n't . " " Do you think it adds to your stature to be irreli-gious ? " My God , what have I said ? the fixer thought . I 'd betterkeep this simple and small or I 'll dig my grave and they 'll lay me in it . He said hastily , " It 's as you say , your honor , yes and no fall into place if you tell the truth . I 'm telling the truth . " " Let 's not complicate matters unnecessarily . " Bibikov sipped from his water glass . " Legally you are a Jew . The Imperial Government considers you one even though you twist and squirm . You are so recorded on your passport . Our laws concerning Jews apply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , why do n't you leave the faith officially ? " " I 'm not ashamed , your honor . Maybe I do n't always like what I see  --  there are Jews of all sorts , as the saying goes , but if I 'm going to be ashamed of anyone , it might as well be myself . " As he said this his color heightened . Bibikov listened with interest . He glanced down at his notes , then looked up with eyes narrowed . Ivan Semyonovitch , the assistant , who reacted quickly to his remarks , often taking on the same facial expression as the magistrate , glancing at the notes from where he sat , leaned forward intently . " The absolute truth , please , " said the Investigating Magistrate sternly . "  --  Are you a revolutionary , either as a theorist or activist ? " Yakov felt the force of his pounding heart . " Does it say that anywhere in your papers , your honor ? " " Please answer my question . " 88 89 " No , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you know what I mean . It 's not my nature . If I 'm anything I 'm a peaceful man . Yakov , ' I used to say to myself , there 's too much violence in the world and if you 're smart you 'll stay out of it . ' It is n't for me , your honor . " " A Socialist or member of any Socialist parties ? " The fixer hesitated . " No . " " Are you certain ? " " I give you my earnest word . " " Are you a Zionist ? " " No . " " Do you belong to any political party whatsoever ? That would include Jewish parties . " " To none at all , your honor . " " Very well . Have you noted the responses , Ivan Sem-yonovitch ? " " Every word , sir . I have it all , " said the pimply assistant . " Good , " said Bibikov , absently scratching his beard . " Now there is another matter I wish to question you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Excuse me , I do n't mean to interrupt , " Yakov said , " but I would like you to know that my passport was stamped Permission Granted ' when I left my village . And when I got to Kiev , the very next day after my arrivalwhich happened late at night  --  the next day I brought it to the passport section of the Police Station of the Podol District . It was also stamped there , your honor . " " That is already noted . I 've examined the passport and your remarks are substantially correct . However , that is n't the matter I was about to bring up . " " It was only in the Lukianovsky , if you 'll excuse me , your honor , that I did n't register . That was where I made a mistake . " " That is also noted . " " If you do n't mind , I 'd like to mention that I served for a short time in the Russian Army . " " Noted . A very short time , less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were you not ? " " Also because the war was over . There was no use for any more soldiers at that time . " " What was the illness ? " " Attacks of asthma , on and off . I would never know when they would hit me next . " " Are you still troubled with this ailment ? " the magistratesaid conversationally . " I ask because my son has asthma . " " Mostly it 's cleared up though sometimes on a windy day I find it hard to draw a breath . " " I 'm glad it 's cleared up . Now permit me to go on to the next item . I will read from the deposition of Zinaida Nikolaevna Lebedev , spinster , age thirty . " This is terrible , the fixer thought , squeezing his hands . Where will it all end ? The door opened . The magistrate and his assistant looked up as two officials strode into the room . One , in a red and blue uniform with gold epaulets , was the officer who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cropped red mustache . The other was the Prosecuting Attorney Grubeshov , Procurator of the Kiev Superior Court . He had that morning gone down to stare at the fixer in his cell without addressing a word to him . Yakov had stood frozen against the wall . Five minutes later the prosecutor had walked away , leaving him in a sweaty state of unrest . Grubeshov placed on the table a worn portfolio with straps . He was a stoutish man with a fleshy face , sidewhiskers , thick eyebrows and hawklike eyes . A roll of flesh on the neck hung over his stiff collar , the tabs of which were90 911bent over a black bow tie . He wore a dark suit with a soiled yellow vest and seemed to be repressing excitement . Yakov was again apprehensive . Bibikov 's assistant had at once arisen and bowed . At a warning glance from the magistrate , the fixer hastily got up and remained standing . " Good morning , Vladislav Grigorievitch , " said Bibikov , a little flustered . " Good morning , Colonel Bodyansky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ivan Semyonovitch , please shut the door . " The colonel brushed his fingers over his mustache , and the Prosecuting Attorney , smiling slightly at nothing in particular , nodded . Yakov , at the magistrate 's signal , shakily resumed his seat . Both officials studied him , the Prosecuting Attorney , once more intently , almost as though appraising the fixer 's health , weight , stamina , sending chills down his back ; or as though he were a new animal in the zoo . But the colonel looked through him as though he did not exist . He wearily wished he did n't . Bibikov read part way down the typewritten first page of the paper in his hand , then flipped through several more pages before he glanced up . " Ah , I have it here , " he said , clearing his throat . " This is the key statement : ' Z. N. Lebedev : I felt from the first he was different or odd in some way but could not guess how basically so , or I would never have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He seemed to me somewhat foreign , but I explained to myself that he was from the provinces and obviously lacking in education and cultivation . I can only say I was on the whole uncomfortable in his presence , although of course truly grateful that he had assisted Papa that time he slipped in the snow . Afterwards I detested him because he tried to assault me . I told him firmly I never wished to see him again  --  ' " " It 's not true , I did n't assault her , " Yakov said , half rising . " It 's not true at all . " " Please , " said Bibikov , staring at him in astonishment . " Silence , " said Colonel Bodyansky , pounding his fist on the table . " Sit down at once ! " Grubeshov drummed with his fingertips . Yakov quickly sat down . Bibikov glanced at the colonelin embarrassment . To the fixer he said firmly , " You will please control yourself , this is a legal investigation . I shall continue to read : Investigating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Z. N. Lebedev : I 'm sure he intended to assault me . By this time I had begun to suspect he might be a Jew but when I saw for certain I screamed loudly . ' " Investigating Magistrate : Explain what you mean that you saw " for certain . " ' " Z. N. Lebedev : He  --  I saw he was cut in the manner of Jewish males . I could not help seeing . ' " Investigating Magistrate : Go on , Zinaida Nikolaevna , after you have calmed yourself . You may be embarrassedbut it is best to speak the truth . ' " Z. N. Lebedev : He realized I would not tolerate his advances and left the room . That was the last I saw of him , and I thank God . ' " Investigating Magistrate : Then there was no assault in the true sense of the word , if you will pardon me ? He did not touch you or attempt to ? ' " Z. N. Lebedev : You may say that but the fact remainshe undressed himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . That 's what he hoped for , or he would n't have undressed and appeared naked . I 'm sure you would n't approve of that , your honor . ' " Investigating Magistrate : There is no approval expressedor implied either of his conduct or yours , Zi-92 93naida Nikolaevna . Did you afterwards inform your father , Nikolai Maximovitch , of this incident ? ' " Z. N. Lebedev : My father is not well and has n't been in good health or spirits since the death of my poor mother . And his only brother died a year ago of a lingeringillness , so I did n't wish to upset him further . He would have wanted to horsewhip the Jew . ' " " It is noted that at this point the witness wept copi-ously . " Bibikov laid down the paper . " Will you say now , " he asked Yakov , " whether you attempted to force yourself upon Zinaida Nikolaevna ? " Ivan Semyonovitch filled the magistrate 's water glass from a porcelain pitcher on the table . " Absolutely not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We ate together twice on her invitation while I was working in the upstairs flat , and the last night  --  the night I finished painting  --  she afterwards invited me to her bedroom . Maybe I should n't have gone  --  that 's obviousnow  --  but it 's not such a hard thing to do when you consider a man 's nature . Anyway , I had doubts and the minute I saw she was unclean , if you 'll excuse me for saying so , your honor , I left . That 's the honest truth and I could try from now to the Day of Judgment and not make it truer . " " What do you mean unclean ' ? " The fixer was distraught . " I 'm sorry to mention suchthings but if a man is in trouble he has to explain himself . The truth of it is she was having her monthlies . " He lifted his manacled hands to wipe his face . " Any Jew who approaches a Russian woman ought to be strung up , " said Colonel Bodyansky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grubeshov spoke with a slight thickness of speech . " I saw the blood , your honor , if you 'll excuse me , while she was washing herself with a cloth . " " You saw the blood ? " the Prosecuting Attorney said sarcastically . " Did that have some religious meaning to you as a Jew ? Do you know that in the Middle Ages Jewishmen were said to menstruate ? " Yakov looked at him in surprise and fright . " I do n't know anything about that , your honor , although I do n't see how it could be . But getting back to Zinaida Nikolaevna Lebedev , what her condition meant to me was that it would n't do either of us any good , and I was a fool to agree to go to her room in the first place . I should have gone home the minute I finished my work and not be tempted by a table full of all kinds of food . " " Relate what happened in the bedroom , " Bibikov said . " And please confine yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your honor , I swear it with my whole heart . It 's as I said before  --  and also the young lady in the paper you just read  --  I got dressed as quickly as I could and left . I assure you of that , and it was the last I saw of her . Believe me , I 'm sorry it happened . " " I do believe you , " said Bibikov . Grubeshov , sharply startled , stared at the InvestigatingMagistrate . Colonel Bodyansky shifted uncomfortablyin his chair . Bibikov , as though justifying himself , said , " We found two letters , both identified by the witnesses as written in their hand . One was from Nikolai Maximovitch addressed to Yakov Ivanovitch Dologushev , praising his diligence as an overseer of the Lebedev Brickworks , and the other was from the daughter , Zinaida Nikolaevna , on a sheet of perfumed blue letter paper , inviting the suspect to call on her at her home and expressly stating in the letter that she was writing it with the permission of her father . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to me by Captain Korimzin of the Kiev City Police , who found them in the office of the brickworks . " 941 951The colonel and Prosecuting Attorney sat like statues . Again addressing Yakov , the magistrate said , " I gather from the date that the letter from the young lady was written after the incident already described ? " " That 's right , your honor . I was working in the brickworksthen . " " You did not write her as she requested ? " " I did n't answer the letter . I figured I was born with a lot more trouble than I needed and there was no sense searching for more . If you 're afraid of a flood stay away from the water . " " Her later remarks to me though of informal nature , " the magistrate said , " affirm your statement . Therefore , considering the circumstances  --  this does not mean that I admire your behavior , Yakov Bok  --  I will recommend to the Prosecuting Attorney that you not be charged with attempted sexual assault . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wrote hastily . The Prosecuting Attorney , flushing through his sidewhiskers , picked up his portfolio , pushed back his chair and got up noisily . Colonel Bodyansky also arose . Bibikovreaching for the water glass , knocked it over . Jumpingup , he dabbed at the spilled water on the table with his handkerchief , assisted by Ivan Semyonovitch , who in dismay quickly gathered up the papers and began to dry those that had got wet . Grubeshov and Colonel Bodyansky , neither speaking a word , strode sullenly out of the room . When he had blotted up the water , the Investigating Magistrate sat down , waited till Ivan Semyonovitch had dried and sorted the papers , and though embarrassed at the incident , picked up his notes , and clearing his throat , once more addressed the fixer in his resonant voice . " We have laws , Yakov Bok , " he said grimly , " directed against any member of your faith , orthodox or heretic , who assumes or counterfeits a name other than that enteredin his official birth records , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deception or another ; but since there are no forged or counterfeited documents involved in this case , and since there is at present no record of similar previous offenses by you , I shall be lenient this time and not press this charge , although I personally feel , as I have already informed you , that your deception was repugnant and it is only by the greatest good fortune that it did not become an even more reprehensible situ-ation  --  " " I thank you kindly , your honor  --  " The fixer wiped his eyes with his fingers . The magistrate went on . " I shall , however , ask the court to charge you for taking up residence in a district forbidden to Jews , except under certain circumstances which do not in any way appertain in your case . In this regard you have disobeyed the law . It is not a capital crime but you will be charged and sentenced for a mis-demeanor . " " Will I be sent to jail , your honor ? " " I am afraid so . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not very long  --  a month at least , possibly less , dependingon the magistrate who sentences you . It will teach you a lesson you are apparently in need of . " " Will I have to wear prison clothes ? " " You will be treated the same as other prisoners . " There was a knock on the door and a uniformed messengerentered . He handed an envelope to Ivan Semyonovitch , who quickly passed it to Bibikov . The Investigating Magistrate , his hand trembling a little , tore it open , read the handwritten note , slowly cleaned his glasses , and hastened out of the room . Though he knew he could expect trouble  --  although he had half hoped he would be let off with a warning or96 97even a severe dressing down and sent running back to the Jewish quarter  --  oh , with what pleasure he would runl  --  Yakov , after his first disappointment , felt relief that things were n't a lot worse . A month in jail is not a year , and three weeks are less ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , rent was free . After his manacled march through the snowy streets , the mutterings of the crowd , and the terrible question the Investigating Magistratehad put to him last night in his cell , he had expecteda calamity if not worse . Now things had calmed down . Practically , there was only this minor charge , and perhaps a lawyer could get the sentence reduced to maybe a week or nothing at all ? It meant , of course , goodbye to some rubles from his savings  --  surely the policewould return them to him  --  but a ruble he could earn , if not in a day , then in a week or month . Better a month spent grubbing for one than a month in prison . It did n't pay to worry over rubles . The main thing was to be free , and once they freed him , Yakov Bok would be less foolish in his dealings with the law . The magistrate 's assistant had hesitantly reached over to read the note that Bibikov had crumpled up and left on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the fixer attempted a smile in return , the assistant vigorously blew his nose . Then the Investigating Magistrate returned , breathingthrough his mouth , his face drawn and grim , followed into the room by Grubeshov and Colonel Bodyansky . Once more they seated themselves at the table , the ProsecutingAttorney again unstrapping his portfolio . Ivan Semyonovitch gazed at them with concern , but neither of the officials spoke . The assistant tested his pen , and held it ready to write . Grubeshov 's smile was gone , his lips set . The colonel 's expression was deadly serious . One look at them and a vast fear again surged through Yakov . Cold sweat prickled his back . Once more he expected the worst . At least almost the worst . " The Prosecuting Attorney will now ask you a few questions , " Bibikov said quietly though hoarsely . He sat back and fiddled with his pince-nez string . " If you please , first my question , " said the colonel , nodding to Grubeshov , who was peering into the compartmentsof his portfolio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Will the prisoner state , " Colonel Bodyansky 's voice boomed out in the room , " whether he is a member of certain political organizations I shall now name : Social Democrats , Socialist-Revolutionists , or any other groups including the Jewish Bund , Zionists of whatever ilk or stripe , Seymists , or Volkspartei ? " " I 've already gone into that , " Bibikov said with a touch of impatience . The colonel turned on him . " Mr. Investigating Magistrate , the task of protecting the Crown from its enemiesis under the jurisdiction of the Secret Political Police . Already there has been too much interference in our affairs . " " Not at all , colonel , we are investigating a civil offense  --  and I wo n't interfere with yours . Tell me , " he said , turning to Yakov , " are you a member of any of those so-called political parties I have just named , or of any secret terroristic or nihilistic organizations ? Answer truthfully or I will send you to the Petropavelsky Fortress . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied hastily . " I 've never belonged to a political party or any secret organizationssuch as you just mentioned . To tell the truth I do n't know one from the other . If I were a better edu-98cated man I might , but as it is now whatever you ask me about them I can tell you very little . " " You will be severely punished if you are lying . " " Who 's lying , your honor ? As a former soldier , I swear I am not lying . " " Save your breath , " said the colonel in disgust , " I 've never met a Jew I could call a soldier . " Yakov 's face turned a fiery red . The colonel wrote furiously on a slip of paper , thrust it into his tunic pocket and nodded to the Prosecuting Attorney . Grubeshov had drawn a black oilskin-covered notebookout of his portfolio and was , with arched brows , studying one of its closely handwritten pages . Then he put the notebook down , and though he stared at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind as he remarked in a dry but slightly thick voice , " Well , we have been amusing ourselves , Mr. Yakov Shepsovitch Bok , alias Dologushev , alias I know not what else , but I now have some serious questions to put to you and I requestthat you give them your most serious attention . By your own admission you are guilty of certain flagrant violationsof Russian law . You have confessed to certain crimes and there is good reason  --  excellent reason  --  to suspect others , one of so serious a nature that I shall not name it until we have further sifted the evidence , which I propose to continue to do now , with the permission of my colleagues . " He bowed to Bibikov , who , smoking , gravely nodded in return . " Oh , my God , " groaned Yakov , " I swear to you I am innocent of any serious crime . No , sir , the worst I am guilty of is stupidity  --  of living in the Lukianovsky without permission , that the Investigating Magistrate says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly not of any serious crimes . " God forgive me , he thought in terror . I 'm in a bad spot now , worse than quicksand . That 's what one gets for not knowing which way he 's running , to begin with . " Answer this question precisely , " said Grubeshov , referringto his notebook . " Are you a Hasid ' or Misnogid ' ? Please take down his answers with extreme accuracy , Ivan Semyonovitch . " " Neither . I 'm neither one nor the other , " said Yakov . " As I told his other honor  --  if I 'm anything at all it 's a freethinker . I say this to let you know I 'm not a religious man . " " That wo n't do you any good , " said the prosecutor , suddenly irritable . " I was expecting just such a response , and of course it 's nothing more than an attempt to divertthe questioning . Now answer me directly , you are a circumcised Jew , are n't you ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that and the rest is personal . " " I 've already gone through all this , Vladislav Grigorievitch , " said Bibikov . " It 's all in the notes of the testimony . Read it to him , Ivan Semyonovitch , it will save time . " " I must ask the Investigating Magistrate not to interrupt , " Grubeshov said testily . " I have no interest in savingtime . Time is immaterial to me . Please let me go on without useless interruption . " Bibikov lifted the pitcher to pour himself a glass of water but it was empty . " Shall I refill it , your honor ? " whispered Ivan Semyonovitch . " No , " said Bibikov , " I 'm not thirsty . " " What 's this freethinker business about ? " said the colonel . " Not now , Colonel Bodyansky , I beg you , " said Grubeshov . " It is not a political party . " Colonel Bodyansky lit a cigarette. 100 101Grubeshov addressed Yakov , reading aloud certain words from his notebook and pronouncing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there not ?  --  Jews who are called tzadikim ' ? When a Jew wishes to harm a Christian , or as you call him , goyim , ' he goes to the tzadik ' and gives him a pidion , ' which is a fee of some sort , and the tzadik ' uses the power of the word , in magical incantations , to bring misfortune on the Christian . Is n't that a true fact ? Answer me . " " Please , " said Yakov , " I do n't understand what you want of me . What have I to do with such things ? " " You 'll find out , if you do n't already know , only too soon , " said Grubeshov , flushing . " In the meantime answerme truthfully and directly without vomiting a mouthful of irrelevant questions in return . Tell me now , what do you Jews mean by afikomen ' ? I want the truth without varnish . " " But what has this got to do with me ? " Yakov said . " What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they 're strange to you they 're strange to me . " " Once more I will direct you to limit yourself to my questions . I will tell you patiently for the last time that I am not interested in your personal comments . Keep in mind that you are already in very serious trouble and curb your tongue . " " I am not positive , " said the fixer , disheartened , " but it 's a matzo of some kind that 's used in the Passover ceremonyfor protection against evil spirits and evil men . " " Write that all down , Ivan Semyonovitch . Is it magic ? " " To my way of thinking it 's superstition , your honor . " " But you say it 's the same as matzos ? " " Practically the same , I think . I 'm not an expert in these things . If you want to know the truth I have n't much use for such matters . I have nothing against thosewho want to follow the customary ways , but for myself I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He glanced at the Investigating Magistrate , but Bibikovwas looking out the window . Grubeshov slid his fingers into the portfolio and withdrewsomething covered with a handkerchief . He slowly peeled the four corners of the handkerchief and triumphantlyheld up a triangle of broken matzo . " This was found in your habitat in the stable at the brick factory . What have you to say now ? " " What can I say , your honor ? Nothing . It 's matzo . It 's not mine . " " Is it matzo shmuro ' ? " " I would n't know if it was or was n't . " " I understand that matzo shmuro ' is eaten by very religiousJews . " " I think so . " " How does it differ from ordinary matzo ? " " Do n't ask me , your honor . I do n't really know . " " I 'll ask what I please . I 'll ask until your eyes pop out . Do you understand that ? " " Yes , sir . " " Did you bake this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it get into your habitat ? That 's where the police found it . " " It was brought in by an old man , a stranger to me . I give you my earnest word . He was lost one night near the cemetery and I took him in till it stopped snowing . Some boys had hit him with rocks . He was frightened . " " Near the cemetery in the Lukianovsky this oc-curred ? " " Where the brickworks is . " " Was he a tzadik ' ? " " Even suppose he was , what has that got to do with me ? " 102103 " Answer with respect ! " The Prosecuting Attorney struck the table with his palm . The piece of matzo fell to the floor . Ivan Semyonovitch hastily retrieved it . He held it up for all to see , it had not broken . Bibikov wet his dry lips . " Answer courteously , " he said . Yakov , in a dull state , nodded . Grubeshov again bowed to the magistrate . " My deepestthanks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed his mind . " Did your friend the tzadik ' come often to the stable ? " he asked Yakov . " He came that once . He was a stranger to me . I never saw him again . " " That was because you were arrested not long after his departure . " Yakov could not argue the point . " Is it true that you hid other Jews in the stable and trafficked with them in stolen goods ? " " No . " " Did you steal systematically from your employer , NikolaiMaximovitch Lebedev ? " " As God is my judge , never a single kopek . " " Are you certain you did not yourself bake this matzo ? A half bag of flour was found in your habitat . " " With respect , your honor , it 's the wrong flour . Also I 'm not a baker . I once tried to bake bread to save a kopek or two but it did n't rise and came out like a rock . The flour was wasted . Baking is n't one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the time  --  I hope nothing has happened to my tools , they 're all I 've got in the world  --  but generally I 'm a fixer , never a matzo baker . What there is to fix I fix though it pays little and generally my luck in jobs has been bad . But I 'm not a criminal , your honor . " Grubeshov listened impatiently . " Answer strictly to the point . Did the tzadik ' bake the matzos ? " " If so not in my house . Who knows if elsewhere , he did n't tell me but I do n't think so . " " Then some other Jew did ? " " It 's probably true . " " It 's more than probable , " said the Prosecuting Attorney , glaring at him . " It 's the truth of God . " When Yakov saw him peering again into his evil portfolio , he wrung his manacled hands under the table . Grubeshov now slowly drew forth a long , stained rag . " Have you seen this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table with his fingers . Bibikov watched the dancing rag , absently polishing his glasses ; Ivan Semyonovitch stared at it in fascination . " I will describe it to you , " said the Prosecuting Attorney . " It is part of a peasant 's blouse similar to the one you are presently affecting . Was this rag , by some chance , formerly a possession of yours ? " " I do n't know , " said Yakov wearily . " I advise you to think more carefully , Yakov Bok . If you 've eaten no garlic your breath wo n't stink . " " Yes , your honor , " Yakov said desperately , " it 's mine more or less , although that 's nothing to worry about . The old man I mentioned to you was hit on the head by a rock , and I used part of an old shirt I was no longer wearing  --  it fell apart on my back  --  to wipe the blood away . That 's God 's own truth and all there is to it , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " shouted the ProsecutingAttorney . Yakov felt his tongue turn to dust . " Did you ever chase any children in the brickworks yard in the vicinity of the kilns , in particular a twelveyearlad by the name of Zhenia Golov ? " The fixer was unable to reply . Grubeshov , after glancing at Bibikov , smiled broadly104 as he mincingly asked the fixer , " Tell me Yankel Jew , why are you trembling ? " 3 Why does a man tremble ? When he was locked in the cell again there were three filthy straw pallets on the floor . One was his  --  what a misery that he could think of it as his ; and two new pris- oners were lying on the others . One was a hairy man in rags , the other a living skeleton . Both stank across the room , of dirt and poverty . Though neither paid any at- tention to him , the ragged one blinking at the wall , the other snoring , the fixer kept to the far corner of the cell . He felt abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me now ? " he asked himself . And if it happens bad who will ever know ? I might as well be dead . Recalling his father-in-law and wife , he could conjure neither of them close . Especially the wife . He thought of his father and mother , young people in their weedy graves , and their fate gave him no comfort . His frustrated innocence outraged him . He was unjustly accused , helpless , unable to offer proof or be believed . What horror would they accuse him of next ? " If they knew me could they say such things ? " He tried to com- prehend what was happening and explain it to himself . After all , he was a rational being , and a man must try to reason . Yet the more he reasoned the less he understood . The familiar had become evil . What happened next was weighted with peril . That he was a Jew , willing or un- willing , was not enough to explain his fate . Remember- ing his life filled him with hatred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a fixer but all my life I 've broken more than I fix . What would they accuse him of next ? How could a man defend himself against such ter- rible hints , insinuations , accusations , if no one was willingto believe him ? Panic gnawed him . He was full of desperate thoughts of what to do next  --  somehow to sneak out of the cell and seek in the ghetto for the old man to tell the Russians that he had been hit on the head by a rock and Yakov had wiped away the blood ? The fixer goes from house to house , knocking on each thin door and asking for the tzadik but nobody knows him ; then in the last house they know him , a saintly man , but he had long ago gone away . The fixer hurriedlytravels on the train to Minsk and after months of desperate searching meets the old man , the moon on his rabbinic hat , coming home one evening from the synagogue . " Please , you must go back to Kiev with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do what they say I did . " But the old tzadik does not recognize the fixer . He looks at him long but shakes his head . The wound on his temple has healed and he can not now recall the night Yakov says he had spent with him in the room above the stable . When the fixer remembered where he was he tore at his hands with his nails , and he tore at his face . The snorer awoke with a gasp . " Akimytch , " he cried out . " Formerly a tailor . I am innocent , " he whimpered . " Do n't beat me . " The other one snickered . " Have you got a cigarette , Potseikin ? " the former tailorasked the one on the other mattress . " A piece of butt ? " " Fuck yourself , " said the blinker , a man with bloodshot eyes . " Have you got a cigarette ? " Akimytch asked Yakov . " My bag is empty , " said the fixer . He held it up. 106 107 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm here , " Akimytch said . " No . " " Neither do I. It 's mistaken identity with me . I never did what they say I did , may they choke to death on their mothers ' milk . They mistook me for an anarchist . " He began to weep . " I 'm here because of a pack of pamphlets or whatever you call ' em , " Potseikin said . " Some poor bastard , a man with wild eyes and a thick greatcoat says to me on InstitutskyStreet , Brother , ' he says , I have to piss , so hold my bundle a minute , and when I come back here I 'll slip you a five-kopek piece , on my honor . ' What can you say to a man who has to piss ? Could I say no to that ? Then he might piss on me . So I held onto his bundle and in two minutes a pig-eyed detective comes running across the street and jabs a gun in my gut so hard it almost busts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to a word I say . When we get there three big ones give me a going over with fat sticks till all my bones are cracked , and they show me where the pamphlets say to overthrow the Tsar . Who wants to overthrow the Tsar ? Personally , I have only the highest regard for Nicholas the Second and the royal family , especially the young princesses and the poor sick boy , who I love as my own . But nobody believed me and that 's why I 'm here . It 's all the fault of those bastard pamph-lets . " " It 's mistaken identity with me , " said Akimytch . " What 's it with you , pal ? " " The same , " said Yakov . " What did they say you did ? " He thought he ought n't to tell them , but it came out quickly , in accusation of the accusers . " They say I killed a boy  --  it 's a dirty lie . " There was a deep silence in the cell . Now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard but he had gone for the soup pail . The two on the straw pallets , their heads together , whispered in each other 's ears , first Akimytch whispering , then Potseikin . " Did you ? " Akimytch asked Yakov . " No , of course not . Why would I kill an innocent child ? " They whispered once more and Potseikin said in a thick voice , " Tell us the truth , are you a Jew ? " " What difference would it make ? " Yakov said , but when they were whispering again he was afraid . " Do n't try anything or I 'll call the guard . " The one in rags got up and approached the fixer , sneering . " So you 're the bastard Jew who killed the Christian boy and sucked the blood out of his bones ? I saw it in the papers . " " Leave me in peace , " Yakov said . " I 've done nothing like that to anybody , not to speak of a twelve-year-old child . It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jew liar . " " Think as you like but let me alone . " " Who else would do anything like that but a motherfuckingZhid ? " Potseikin pounced on the fixer and with his rotten teeth tried to bite his neck . Yakov shoved him off but Akimytch , foul-breathed , was on his back beating the fixer 's head and face with his clammy bony hands . " Christkiller ! " " Gevaltl " cried Yakov , flailing his arms . Though he whirled , ducked , and struck out with his fists , Potseikinhit him with a knee in the back as Akimytch struck him on the neck with both fists . The fixer went down , his mind darkened in pain . He lay motionless as they kicked him savagely , and felt as he passed out , a terrible rage. 108 ) Afterwards he woke on his mattress , and when he heard their snoring , retched . A rat scuttled across his genitals and he bolted up in horror . But there was a bit of horned moon at the small high barred window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable had burned to the ground in a matter of minutes , Proshko said , spitting at the fixer 's feet , and it would n't surprise him if it were done with Jewish magic . He pointed to the blackened remains of the stalls where four maddened , rearing , trumpeting horses had died , and a crisscross pile of burnt and broken planks and timbershad fallen from the roof . The mustached and bearded officials in the brickyard , some uniformed and booted , a few carrying umbrellas although it was no longer raining , and the Secret Police gendarmes , plainclothes detectives , and Kiev City Police  --  among them also an Imperial Army general with two rows of gold buttons and one of medals across his chest  --  1101 looked on in silence as the foreman spoke . Grubeshov , in English bowler , mud-spattered gaiters , and rain cape , flushed at Proshko 's testimony , whispered in Colonel Bodyansky 's lowered ear , clutching his hand tightly , and the colonel earnestly whispered something in return as Yakov licked his dry lips . Bibikov , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter scarf and large hat , standing behind two tight-faced Black Hundreds representatives wearing their accusatory buttons , chain- smoked cigarettes from a box he amiably offered around . Nearby , the pimply Ivan Semyonovitch accompanied an oldish priest of the Orthodox Church , Father Anastasy , a " specialist , " Yakov had heard it whispered , " of the Jewish religion " ; he was a round-shouldered man with a streaked beard , thin hands , and restless dark eyes , dressed in flowing vestments and round pot-hat which he pressed down with his palm when the wind blew . What he was expected to add to the miserable state of Yakov 's affairs the fixer did n't know and was afraid to guess . Manacled , his legs chained , nervously exhausted , his body in flight though he tried with ten fingers to hold onto his mind , he stood with five armed guards at his back , apart from the rest . Though almost a month had gone by since his arrest he could still only half believe this had happened to him , someone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and listened stunned to Proshko , as though the accusation of the monstrous crime were both true and an irrelevancy , as though it had happened to someone he did n't know very well , in truth a stranger , although he clearly re- membered fearing that something like this might hap- pen to him . Otherwise the brickyard was deserted on a gray and green overcast Sunday afternoon in what had been a cold May . None of the workers was around except for the drivers Richter and Serdiuk , who listened without speaking and occasionally spat , the Ukrainian holding his cap in his large red hand , ill at ease , the German staringdarkly at the former overseer . Nikolai Maximovitch had been expected but Yakov knew it was too late in the day for him to leave the house sober . After a morning fog had thinned and lifted , it began to rain heavily ; and it poured again in the afternoon . The horses drawing the half dozen carriages that had left at intervals from the District Courthouse in the Plossky , and met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the motorcar carrying Yakov , Colonel Bodyansky and the gendarmes , had got stuck in the mud on a road in the Lukianovsky , drawing several people , and irritating the Prosecuting Attorney , who made it known to the chauffeur that he did n't want " the matter getting out . " Not very much about the fixer had appeared in the newspapers . All they seemed to know was that a Jew from the Podol had been arrested " as a suspicious person , " but not who or why . Grubeshov had promised more information at a later date in order not , presently , to impede the investigation . Bibikov , before they left the courthouse , had managed to convey this to Yakov , but not much else . " Start from the beginning , " Grubeshov said to Proshko , dressed in his Sunday thick-trousered suit with short jacket . "  --  I want to hear your earliest suspicions . " The Prosecuting Attorney had planned this re-enactment , he had told the accused , " to let you know the inescapablelogic of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your own benefit . " " But how for my benefit ? " " It will become clear to you . " The foreman blew his nose , wiped it in two strokes and thrust the handkerchief into his pants pocket . " On one look I knew he was a Jew , even though he was faking that he was a Russian . It 's easy enough to tell112 113an onion from a radish if you 're not color blind . " Proshko laughed a little from the chest . " Yakov IvanovitchDologushev , he called himself , but I knew from the sound of it on his tongue that the name did n't fit him . A name belongs to you as your birthright , but it hung on him like a suit of stolen clothes . I felt in my blood he was a Jew the same way as you feel in the dark the presence of a ghost . Wait up , little brother , I thought to myself , something smells fishy here . Maybe it 's his natural smell , or the way he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he runs when he chases young boys , but when I looked with both of my eyes open I saw what I already knew  --  he was a Zhid and no two ways about it . You ca n't make a gentleman out of a toad , as the saying goes , and a born Jew ca n't hide the Zhid in his face . This is a foxy bastard , I thought to myself , and he thinks he 's got it hidden because he wears a belted sheepskin coat and has shaved off his Jewish whiskers and curls , and maybe it 'll be a little slow smoking him out of his hole now that he 's fooled Nikolai Maximovitch , but smoke him out I will , and with God 's help it 's what I did . " " Tell the details , " said Grubeshov . " It was n't more than fifteen minutes after I first saw him that I went back to the office shack and asked him for his papers so as to hand them over to the District Police , and right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had given them to the boss and he had registered them with the police . If a man talks crooked , I thought to myself , he 's crooked elsewhere , and I 'll watch out to see where else . I did n't have long to wait . Once when he was nosing around the kilns for purposes of his own , I sneaked into the shack and checked up on his figures in the books . He was crooked in his accounts and every day entered smaller amounts than he should so he could keep some rubles for himself  --  not so many , a Jew is cunning  --  maybe three or four or five a day that NikolaiMaximovitch had no suspicions of , and he saved himself a nice little pile in a tin can in his room . " " You 're a liar , " Yakov said , trembling , " you 're the thief and you 're putting it on me . You and your drivers stole thousands of bricks from Nikolai Maximovitch , and you hated me for watching you so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What did he do with the rubles you say he stole ? " Bibikov asked the foreman . " There were about ninety in the tin can , if I remember correctly . If he was stealing four rubles a day , let us say , he should have had many more . " " Who knows what a Jew does with money . I 've heard it said they take it to bed with them and give it a fuck once in a while . I bet he gave most of it to the Zhidy synagogue in the Podol . They have plenty of uses for a Russian ruble . " " The Secret Police confiscated altogether one hundred and five rubles , " Grubeshov announced after conferringwith Colonel Bodyansky . " Keep your mouth shut , " he said to Yakov . " Answer when you 're spoken to. , , " What 's more , " Proshko went on , " he sneaked other Jews into the brickyard , and one was one of those Hasids with a round hat , or whatever you call them , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The other one came when they thought nobody was around to watch them . They both tied horns on their heads and prayed to the Jewish God . I watched them through the window and saw them praying and eating matzos . I figured they baked some in the stove up there and I was right , there was half a sack of flour hidden under the bed that the police got . I kept track of them because I had my own suspicions , like I told you . I saw this one here sneaking around like a ghost at night , his face white and eyes114 115strange , looking for something , and I also saw him chasingthe boys that I told you about . I was worried he would do them some kind of harm , little knowing how right I was . One day two or three school kids came in the yard with their book satchels . I saw him chase them but they got away over the fence . Once I asked him , Yakov Ivanovitch , why did you chase those young school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do is to see how we make brick , ' but he answered me , If they are so innocentJesus Christ will protect them . ' He thought Proshko would n't know what he meant by that but I did . " Yakov groaned . " That 's why I kept my eye on him and when I could n't I told the drivers to watch him . " " That 's so . " Serdiuk , still smelling of horse , nodded , and Richter said yes . " I saw them praying with their little black hats on , and I spied on them when they were baking those matzos . Then when the boy was murdered and they found him in the cave with all those wounds the morningit was snowing  --  when the snow came again in April  --  I saw this one take the other Jew with the round hat down the stairs and they left the brickyard in a hurry . I went up there , walking right in their footsteps in the snow so he would n't see I had been there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had baked , half a bag of flour under the bed , his sack of tools , and that bloody rag I told you about . The devil scatters his dung wherever he goes . " After that he wanted to set the stable on fire to burn the evidence but he saw I had my eye on him . When I met him in the brickyard the blood ran out of his face and he could n't raise his eyes at me . That was after they had killed the kid . After the funeral I went to the police , and in a week they came and arrested him . They tookthe matzos away and the other things that I told you about , but I went up there with Serdiuk and Richter here , to tear up the floorboards  --  some had certain dark stains on them that we wanted to show the police . Just then we see an old graybeard Jew run out of the stable , and the next thing the place was up in roaring flames , and the whole stable burned down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by luck we saved any of the horses . We saved six and lost four . If the fire had been an ordinary kind we would 've saved the whole ten , but being as it was , there was something that made it burn as if the wind was caught in it , and it cried out like people were dying and ghosts were going to meet them . They had said some magic words from a Zhidy book , I 'll swear to God , and upstairs where this one here had lived before they arrested him , the flames turned an oily green such as I never saw before , and then yellow , and then almost black , and they burned twice as fast as the fire in the stalls even though the loft was full of hay . In the stalls the fire burned orange and red , and it was slower , more like an ordinary fire , so we got six horses out of the burningstalls and lost the other four . " Richter swore every word was true and Serdiuk crossed himself twice. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the martyred boy , a tallish , scrawnyneckedwoman with red-rimmed , wet , flecked gray eyes , and dark skin drawn tautly over her face , who tried to curtsy and collapsed in the priest 's arms . " Forgive us our transgressions , Father , " she wept . " You must forgive us , my child , " said the priest , in a nasal voice . " The world has sinned against you . In particular , those who sin against our Lord . " 116 117He crossed himself , his hand like a bird , and so did some of the officials . Marfa Golov , when Yakov first saw her waiting for the officials to arrive , was standing , with a thick-shawled neighbor who quickly ran off when the carriages appeared , on the sagging steps of a two-story wooden house with a peaked corrugated tin roof . The house overlookeda low-walled cemetery , and in the distance the brickyard , which Bibikov stopped to stare at , its chimneyssmokeless on Sunday . It was a boxlike house that had once been painted white but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard , muddy from the rain , was surrounded by a high unpainted fence , held together horizontally on the street side by long uneven darkly weathered boards . The road in front of the house where the carriages and motorcar waited was pitted and muddy , and the carriages looked like those of a funeral party except that there was no visible hearse . Marfa , thirty-nine , the newspaper had said , and vaguely pretty , with a tense distracted manner , eyes glancing in every direction , a drawn unhappy mouth and slight chin , wore for the occasion a dark-flowered blouse , long green skirt , and pointed two-tone button shoes . She had pinned a discolored cameo at her worn throat and thrown a light scarf over her shoulders . And she had on a new white hat topped with a bunch of bright cherries that caused some interested glances . When the fixer was led through the gate into the yard , Marfa burst into sobs . One of the officials in the Prosecuting Attorney 's office and a gendarmenearby cursed the prisoner under their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's surely the one , " Marfa gasped . " Which one is that ? " Bibikov asked , snapping on his silver-rimmed pince-nez and staring at her . " The Jew Zhenia told me about , who had chased him with a long knife . " " Note the identification , " said Grubeshov to Ivan Semyonovitch . The assistant had n't his notebook with him , but he mentioned it to one of the policemen , who wrote it down . There was a green mildewed stone well in the yard and Bibikov peered down it but could see nothing . He dropped a small stone down the well and after a while there was a splash . The officials looked at one anotherbut the Investigating Magistrate walked away . " The room 's upstairs , your honor , " Marfa said to the Prosecuting Attorney . " It 's small as you 'll see , but Zhenia was small himself for a lad his age . That 's not from me , you 'll notice , because I do n't lack size , but from his cowardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marfa led them in and hurried upstairs to show the officials where the poor child had slept . They wiped their feet on a muddy rag at the door and went up in small hushed groups to stare into the dark tiny cubicle between a large untidy bedroom with a two-pillowed brass bed , and a room with a locked door Marfa said was a storeroom . " What can a widow do with so many bedrooms ? GenerallyI store things . When my aunt died she left me her furniture although I have enough of my own . " Yakov was ordered to go up after the others had seen the boy 's room . He wanted not to go but knew that if he said so they would drag him up . He went slowly up the stairs in his clanking leg chains that rubbed his ankles sore , followed by three booted gendarmes who waited for him on the landing with drawn pistols . Marfa , FatherAnastasy , Grubeshov , Ivan Semyonovitch and ColonelBodyanksy were in the corridor as the Jew glanced furtively into the boy 's room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fixer had wanted to look calmly and with dignity but had been unable118 119to . It was as though he expected a wild animal in the room to spring out at him . He glanced fearfully into the tiny cubicle with torn wallpaper and unmade cot , the crumpled bedsheet gray , soiled , the faded blanket torn . Though the room and cot were strange to him , Yakov had a momentary hallucinatory thought he had seen them before . He then recalled his cubicle in the printer 's flat in the Podol . This was what he rememberedbut he worried they thought he was thinking of something that would surely convict him were it known what . " My darling Zhenechka hoped to be a priest , " Marfa whispered loudly to Father Anastasy , dabbing at her reddenedeyes with a scented handkerchief . " He was a religiouschild and worshipped God . " " It was reported to me that he was being prepared for the seminary , " said the priest . " One of the monks told me he was a dear boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already had a mystical experience . I was also told he loved our priestly vestments and hoped some day to wear them . His death is God 's loss . " Marfa wept miserably . Ivan Semyonovitch 's eyes clouded and he turned away and wiped them on his coat sleeve . Yakov felt like crying but could n't . Then Father Anastasy came down and Bibikov went up the stairs , squeezing past the gendarmes . He glanced casually into Zhenia 's small room , looked around abently , then got down on his knees , and lifting the bedheet , peeked under the bed . He touched the floor and xamined his soiled fingertips . " The floor may be dusty , " Marfa said quickly , " but I always empty the chamber pot . " " Never mind that , " said Grubeshov distastefully . " Well , what have you discovered ? " he asked Bibikov . " Nothing . " The Investigating Magistrate glanced quickly intoMarfa 's bedroom and stopped at the locked door of the other room as if he were listening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downstairs . Marfa hurriedly attempted to make the boy 's bed up but Grubeshov orderedher to leave it alone . " It will take me only a minute . " " Leave it as it is . The police prefer it that way . " They went downstairs . Although it was drizzling outside , some of the officials were gathered in the yard . The others , including the prisoner and gendarmes who guarded him , met in Marfa 's dusty disordered parlor that smelled of tobacco smoke , stale sweet beer , and cabbage . At Grubeshov 's request , she pulled open the window vent , and with a dirty rag hastily wiped the seats of a half dozen chairs nobody sat down in . The prisoner was afraid to sit . Marfa tried to do something to the floor with a broom but the Prosecuting Attorney took it from her . " This can wait , Marfa Vladimirovna . Please give us your fullest attention . " " I just thought I 'd clean up a bit , " she hurriedly explained . " To tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought the prisoner was coming to see what he had done and why should I clean up for a dirty Jew ? " " That 'll do , " Grubeshov said . " We 're not interested in your household affairs . Go now into the story of what happened to your son . " " Ever since he was little he wanted to be a priest , " Marfa wept , " but now he 's a dead corpse in his grave . " " Yes , we all know that and it 's a tragic story , but perhaps you ought to limit yourself to what you know about the details leading up to the crime . " " First should n't I serve tea , do you think , yourhonor ? " she asked , distracted . " The samovar 's boiling . " " No , " he said . " We are very busy and have much to120 121do before we can return to our homes . Please tell the story  --  specifically of Zhenia 's disappearance and death  --  how , for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said to Yakov , who was gazing out the windowat the rain in the chestnut trees , " you know well this concerns you so pay attention . " In the time the fixer had been in prison the city had turned green and there were sweet-smelling lilacs everywhere but who could enjoy them ? Through the open window he could smell the wet grass and new leaves , and where the cemetery ended there were birches with silver trunks . Somewhere nearby an organ grinder was playing a waltz that Zinaida Nikolaevna had played for him once on her guitar , " Summer Is Gone Forever . " " Go on , please , " Grubeshov said to Marfa . She lifted both hands to straighten her hat , then caught his eye and dropped them . " He was an earnest boy , " Marfa quickly began , " and never gave me much trouble as boys do . As for myself I 'm a widow of stainless character , pure and simple . My husband , who was a telegrapher , deserted me , as I mentionedbefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died of galloping consumption , which served him right for the way he mistreated us . I support myself by hard work and that 's why my house that you 're in is n't the neatest , but my child has always had a roof over his head , and my life has been one of irreproachable toil . If you work like a horse you ca n't live like the gentry , if you 'll pardon my frankness . We got along without the deserter . This house does n't belong to me , I rent it and sometimes let out a room or two , though one has to be careful of riffraff , especially those not given to paying what they owe to others . I did n't want my child associatingwith such , so I rarely took boarders in  --  even though I had to work that much harder  --  and then only if they were genteel people . But even if he did n't have all theadvantages , Zhenia had what he needed and was n't above showing his appreciation by giving me help  --  not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vasya Shiskovsky in the next house from here . My own was an obedient lad , an angel . He once asked me if he should leave the ecclesiastical school and become a butcher 's apprentice but I advised him , Zhenia , my good darling , it 's best to go on with your lessons . Get an educationand when you 're rich some day , you can support your poor mother in her old age . ' Mamenka , ' he answeredme , I will always take care of you even when you are old and sick . ' He was a saintly child , and it did n't in the least surprise me when he came back from his Bible lesson one day and said he wanted to be a priest . My eyes were full of tears that day . " She glanced nervously at Grubeshov , who nodded slightly . " Go on , Marfa Vladimirovna , tell now what happenedtowards the end of March , a few short weeks beforethe Jewish Passover this year . And speak more slowly so that we can comprehend everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you paying attention ? " he asked Yakov . " The closest , your honor , though I honestly do n't understand what this has to do with me . It 's all so strange . " " Only be patient , " Grubeshov said . " It will be as familiarand close as the nose on your face . " Several of the officials , including the army general , laughed . " On the morning in the week you mention , " said Marfa , darting a glance at the Jew , " it was a Tuesday I 'll never forget in my life , Zhenia woke up and got dressed in his black stockings that I had bought him for his name day and left for school as usual at six in the morning . I had to work until long after dark that day , then attend to the marketing so I naturally did n't get home122 until late . Zhenia was n't in the house and after I had rested a while  --  I 've had painful varicose veins since giv- ing birth to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the next house down a ways , whose Vasya was in Zhenia 's form in school , and asked him where my boy was . Vasya said he did n't know because though he had seen Zhenia after school , Zhenia had n't come home with him as was usual . Where did he go ? ' I said . I do n't know , ' he answered . Ach , I thought , he is at his grand- mother 's , I wo n't worry . But on the same night I caught the flu . I had the shakes and shivers for three days and stayed in bed in a weak condition for three more , only getting up , if you 'll excuse me , to go to the toilet , or boil up a little rice and water to stop diarrhea . Zhenia was missing for about a week  --  six or seven days to be exact , and when I made up my mind to get dressed and report it to the police he was found dead in a cave with forty- seven stabs on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow steps and sad faces  --  they looked like dead folk and frightened me before they spoke  --  then when they told me what horror had happened to me , I cried out , My life is over because I 've lost my reason to live ! ' " Marfa put her hand to her eyes and tottered . Two of the officials stepped towards her but she held onto a chair and remained upright . The men withdrew . " Excuse me , " Bibikov said gently , " but how is it you waited six or seven whole days before thinking to report that your son was missing ? If it were my son I would have reported it at once  --  at the very latest on the night he had not yet appeared in the house . It 's true that you were sick but even sick people have been known to pull themselves out of bed and act in emergencies . " " It all depends on how sick they are , if you please , your honor . Whether it 's your son or mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides , your thoughts are n't always at their best . I worried about Zhenia and had terrible nightmares besides . I was afraid he was in some kind of horrible trouble , but I thought I dreamed that because I was feverish . And while I was so sick with the flu , so was my neighbor Sofya , and also Vasya . No one came to knock on my door , as usually happens two or three times during the day . And Yuri Shiskovsky , Sofya 's husband , is as likely to knock on a person 's door when you need him as Father Christmas . We do n't get along at all but that 's a story for a winter night . Anyway , if someone had come into my house duringthose five or six days I would have split both his ears crying out my fears for my poor child , but nobody ever did . " " Let her go on with the story , " Grubeshov said to Bibikov . " If necessary you can ask questions later . " The Investigating Magistrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's necessary enough , Vladislav Grigorievitch , but as you please , I 'll ask later . As for what else may be necessary , or even not so necessary , for instance this entire procedure during a time of investigation , I think we ought to discuss that too , at least in principle if for no other reason . " " Tomorrow , " said Grubeshov . " We 'll talk over everythingtomorrow . " " Come now to the point of the matter , Marfa Vladimirovna , " he said . " Tell us what Zhenia and Vasya Shiskovskytold you about the Jew before the fatal incident . " Marfa had listened intently to the exchange between the men , alternating uneasiness with apparent boredom . When Bibikov was speaking she cast nervous glances around her but lowered her eyes if anyone looked at her . " Vasya also told me what I heard Zhenia say more than once  --  that they were afraid of the Jew in the brick-yard . " " Go on , we 're listening . " 124 125 " Zhenia told me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factory yard they saw two Jews  --  it was toward nightfall  --  sneak through the gate and go up the stairs where this one lived . " She glanced at the fixer , then averted her eyes . He was standing with his head bowed . " Excuse me for interrupting , " Bibikov said to the Prosecuting Attorney , " but I would like to understand how the boys identified the two men as Jews ? " Colonel Bodyansky guffawed and Grubeshov smiled . " Easily , your honor , " Marfa said in excitement , " they were wearing Jewish clothes and had long rough beards , not nicely trimmed ones like some of the gentlemen here . Also the boys used to peek in the window and saw them praying . They wore black hats and robes . The boys were frightened and ran home here . I asked Vasya to stay for a cup of cocoa and slice of white bread with Zhenia , but he was scared sick and said he wanted to go home to his own house . " Grubeshov listened , standing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I heard from the boys that this one here brought other Jews up in his stable . One was an old man with a black satchel that the Lord knows what they did with . Zhenia once told this one to his face that he would tell the foreman if he chased him again . And if you do that I 'll kill you once and for all , ' said the Jew . One day Zhenia saw him running after another boy in the brickyard , a lad not eight years old from the neighborhood around here , Andriushka Khototov , whose father is a street sweeper . The boy luckily got out through the open gate , thank the Lord . Then the Jew saw my Zhenia and chased him , but my Zhenia climbed the fence and escaped that time , though he told me his heart hurt because he did not think he would get over the fence before the Jew grabbed him . One day , hiding by the kiln , Zhenia saw two of the Jews try to catch a Russian child and drag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart one and bit , clawed , and screamed so loud they got frightened and let him go . I warned Zhenia more than once not to go back there or he might get kidnapped and killed , and he promised me he would n't . I think he did n't for a time , then one night he came home frightenedand feverish , and when I cried out , Zhenia , what ails you , tell me quickly what happened ? ' he said that the Jew had chased him with a long knife in the dark among the gravestones in the cemetery . I got down on my knees to him . Zhenia Golov , in the name of the Holy Mother , promise me not to go near that evil Jew again . Do n't go in that brickyard . " Yes , dear Mamenka , ' he said , ' I will promise . ' That 's what he said , but he went back in there again , anyway . Boys are boys , your honor , as you already know . God knows what draws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under lock and key in this house as I sometimes did when he was a little boy he 'd be alive today and not a corpse in his coffin . " She fervently crossed herself . " Marfa Vladimirovna , please tell us what else you were told by the two boys , " Grubeshov said to her . " I was told they had seen a bottle of blood on the Jew 's table . " The army general gasped and the officials looked at each other in horror . Yakov stared whitely at Marfa , his lips working in agitation . " There was no bottle of blood on my table , " he cried out . " If there was anything it was a jar of strawberry jam . Jam is not blood . Blood is not jam . " " Be quiet ! " Grubeshov ordered . " We will inform you when it is your time to speak . " One of the gendarmes pointed his revolver at Yakov . " Put that foolish gun away , " Bibikov said . " The man is chained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle of blood ' ? " he asked Marfa . " No , but both of the boys did , and they told me about it . They could hardly talk . Their faces were green . " " Then why did n't you report that to the police ? It was your duty to , as well as the other incidents you just enumerated , as for instance the suspect chasing your son with a knife . That is a criminal act . This is a civilized society . Such things must be reported to the police . " She answered at once : " Because I 've had my fill of the police , if you wo n't mind me saying so , your honor , and with apologies to those of them present that never both- ered me . I once complained to them that Yuri Shiskov- sky , for reasons that will be kept to myself , struck me on the head with a block of wood , and all morning they kept me in the police station answering personal ques- tions while they filled out long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that madman who they let go , al- though I had a bloody gash in my scalp , and even an idiot would know who had hit who . I ca n't afford to lose my time like that . I have to earn a living and that 's why I did n't report what the boys told me . " " Which is understandable enough , " said Grubeshov  --  turning to the general , who nodded  --  " although I agree with the Investigating Magistrate that such things should be reported at once . Now finish your story , Marfa Vladimirovna . " " I have finished , there 's no more to tell . " " In that case , " said the Prosecuting Attorney , address- ing the officials , " it 's best to move on . " He pulled a thin gold watch from his yellow waistcoat pocket and consulted it closely . " Vladislav Grigorievitch , " Bibikov said , " I must insist on my prerogative to question the witness . " Marfa 's intent gaze at him changed from fear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she cried out . " Neither of us has done anything to the other , that 's not the point . Marfa Golov , I would like to ask you a question or two . Please , Vladislav Grigorievitch , I insist . Unfortunately , I ca n't go into certain things just now , but one or two questions I insist on asking and I would like them answered honestly and directly . Is it true , for instance , Marfa Golov , that you receive stolen goods from a gang of thieves , one of whom is or was your lover who often visits this house ? " " You need n't bother to answer that , " Grubeshov said , flushing . " It 's irrelevant to the matter at issue . " " I insist it is not so irrelevant , Vladislav Grigorie-vitch . " " No , I do n't receive such goods , " said Marfa , whitelipped , her eyes darkening . " That 's a filthy rumor spread by my enemies . " " Is that your response ? " " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is it true that a year ago last January you threw the contents of a phial of carbolic acid into the eyes of your lover and blinded him for life , a man whom you have since become reconciled with ? " " Is he the one who reported me ? " she asked , enraged . " Reported you ? " " Told you these filthy lies ? " " Boris Alexandrovitch , as your superior in rank , I forbidthese questions , " Grubeshov said , irritated . " If you have anything of that nature to ask , please do so in my office tomorrow morning , though I personally do n't see how such irrelevancies can matter . They do not change the weight of the significant evidence . We must absolutelyget on now . It 's Sunday and we all have obligationsto our families . " 128 S 129 " What is the significant evidence ' you refer to ? " " The evidence we have been engaged in collecting , including the evidence of history . " " History is not law . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must insist on a reply from Marfa Golov . " " I have no more to say than I 've already said , " Marfa answered haughtily . " He used to beat me up and I defendedmyself . My legs and back were black and blue for months where he beat me , and once he smashed me in the eye so hard it ran pus for three weeks . " " Is it true that he also beat your son , once so severely that the boy lost consciousness ? " " I forbid you to answer , " Grubeshov shouted . " Do n't be a fool , " Colonel Bodyansky said to Bibikov . " The Jew killed my child , " Marfa cried out . " Somebodyought to scratch his eyes . " She ran to the window and called out of the open vent to the gravestones in the cemetery , " Zhenia , my baby , come home ! Come home to your mother ! " She wept heartbrokenly . She 's insane , thought Yakov . So is her hat with the cherries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starving wolf from the forest , " Marfa , turning to the fixer , shouted . " Make him stop ! " There was a stir among the officials . Two of the gendarmespinned the prisoner by his arms . Marfa , glaring at him , attempted then to remove her hat . Her eyelids fluttered , and moaning she sank to the floor . The hat rolled off her head , but before fainting she gazed loosely around to see where it was . Father Anastasy and Colonel Bodyansky bent to assist her . When Marfa recovered only the police and gendarmes were in the room with her and the prisoner . Bibikov , toYakov 's misery , had left first , and he saw him , through the window , walk down the muddy road and get into a carriage alone . The dead boy 's mother asked for her hat , blew on it , and put it carefully away in a sideboard drawer . She covered her head with a coarse black shawl. 3Grubeshov , in his bowler and wet rain cape , hovered over Father Anastasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing on a low flat rock , his voice rising and falling sometimes out of context with what he was saying , nasally recited the blood guilt of the Jewish Nation . The group of officials and police had abandoned the carriages and motorcar at the bottom of an inclined street paved with rocks , lined on one side by a row of blackened shanties from which people stared at them out of windows and doorways , but no one came out to watch . A flock of pigeons rose in the street and two small white dogs , barking shrilly , darted into the houses as the crowd of officials approached . On foot they climbed first up the steps of a terraced hill from which the winding Dnieper was visible in the distance , then descended into a muddy ravine , and along it to the bottom of an almost perpendicular rocky hill with some caves in its face , in one of which the body of Zhenia Golov had been found . This cave , minutely described in the newspapers Yakov had read on the day of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut into the hill by religious hermits centuries ago , was about fifteen feet up its face . To get up into it one climbed the rough steps that had been hewn into the rocky hill . On top of it was a sparse birchwood grode with thin-trunked white trees full of chirping swallows , 130 131and beyond that lay a flat section of the outskirts of the city consisting of scattered houses and empty lots , about two versts from Nikolai Maximovitch 's brick factory . " There is from here an almost straight road from the brick factory where Zhenia was presumed to be killed , " Grubeshov said . " But , permit me , Vladislav Grigorievitch , to draw your attention to the fact that the road from Marfa Golov 's house is just as straight and a little shorter , " said Bibikov . " In any case , " the Prosecuting Attorney answered , " the most important evidence will be the testimony of the experts . " The priest , a long-haired , large-nosed man whose breath smelled of garlic , was standing under Grubeshov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prosecuting Attorney had Yakov brought up close , the officials giving way as he was pushed forward , his chains rattling , by his guards . Bibikov , standing in the rear , looked on , impassively smoking . It was still drizzling and the fixer had lost his cap , unsettling him further , more than he thought possible in his present condition . It 's only a cap , not my life ; but the thought was a terrible one , because it was the first time he had admitted to himself he was afraid for his life . Fearing he was about to hear some secret fact that would absolutely condemn him once it was known , he stood inch-deep in the mud , breathing thickly , listening transfixed . " My dear children , " said the priest to the Russians , wringing his dry hands , " if the bowels of the earth were to open to reveal the population of human dead since the beginning of the world , you would be astonished to see how many innocent Christian children among them have been tortured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described in their holy books and various commentaries , the voice of Semitic blood directs themto desecrations , unspeakable horrors  --  for example , the Talmud , which likens blood to water and milk , and preaches hatred of gentiles , who are characterized as being not human , no more than animals . Thou shalt not kill ' does not apply to us , for do not they also write in their books : Murder the good among gentiles ' ? This , perfidy , too , is prescribed in their Kabbala , the book of Jewish magic and alchemy , wherein the name of Satan is invoked ; hence there have been multitudes of slaughteredinnocent children whose tears have not moved their murderers to mercy . " His eyes darted over the faces of the officials but no one moved . " The ritual murder is meant to re-enact the crucifixionof our dear Lord . The murder of Christian children and the distribution of their blood among Jews are a token of their eternal enmity against Christendom , for in murdering the innocent Christian child , they repeat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own warm blood , symbolizes to us our Lord 's loss of his precious lifeblood , drop by cruel drop , as he hung in pain on the wooden cross to which the anti-Christ had nailed him . It is said that the murder of the gentile  --  any gentile  --  hastens the coming of their long-awaited Messiah , Elijah , for whom they eternally leave the door open but who has never , during all the ages since his first coming , bothered to accept the invitation to enter and sit in the empty chair . Since the destruction of their Temple in Jerusalem by the Legions of Titus there has been no sacrificial altar for animals in their synagogues , and it has come about , therefore , that the killing of gentiles , in particular innocent children , is accepted as a fitting substitute . Even their philosopher Maimonides , whose writingswere suppressed in our country in 1844 , orders Jews to murder Christian children . Did I not tell you they think of us as animals ? 132 133 " In the recorded past , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the Jew has had many uses for Christian blood . He has used it for purposes of sorcery and witches ' rituals , and for love potions and well poisoning , fabricating a deadly venom that spread the plague from one country to another , a mixture of Christianblood from a murdered victim , their own Jewish urine , the heads of poisonous snakes , and even the stolen mutilated host  --  the bleeding body of Christ himself . It is written that all Jews require some Christian blood for the prolongation of their lives else they die young . And in those days they considered our blood to be  --  this too is recorded  --  the most effective therapeutic for the cure of their diseases . They used it , according to their old medical books , to heal their women in childbirth , stop hemorrhages , cure the blindness of infants , and to alleviate the wounds of circumcision . " One of the Kiev police officials , Captain Korimzin , a man in a damp coat and muddy boots , secretly made the sign of the cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him intently for a minute , went on , and although he spoke calmly his gestures were agitated . The Russians continued to listen with grave interest . " There are those among us , my children , who will argue that these are superstitious tales of a past age , yet the truth of much I have revealed to you  --  I do not say it is all true  --  must be inferred from the very frequency of the accusations against the Jews . None can forever concealthe truth . If the bellman is dead the wind will toll the bell . Perhaps in this age of science we can no longer accept every statement of accusation made against this unfortunate people ; however we must ask ourselves how much truth remains despite our reluctance to believe . I do not say that all Jews are guilty of these crimes and that pogroms should therefore be instituted againstthem , but that there are certain sects among them , in particular the Hasidim and their leaders , the tzadikim , who commit in secret crimes such as I have described to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience with them , seems to forget until , lo ! another poor child disappears and is found dead in this fashion : his hands tied behind his back , and his body punctured by a sharp weapon in several places , the number of wounds according to magic numbers : 3 , 7 , 9 , 13 , in the manner of such crimes of former times . We know that their Passover , though they ascribe to it other uses , is also a celebration of the crucifixion . We know that is the time they kidnap gentiles for their religious ceremonials . Here in our Holy City , during the Polovostian raids in the year I too , the monk Eustratios was abducted from the PecheraMonastery and sold to the Jews of Kherson , who crucified him during Passover . Since they no longer dare such open crimes they celebrate the occasion by eating matzos and unleavened cakes at the Seder service . But even this act conceals a crime because the matzos and cakes contain the blood of our martyrs , though of course the tzadikim deny this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consume the agonizedbody of the living Christ . I give you my word , my dear children , that this is the reason why Zhenia Golov , this innocent child who wished to enter the priesthood , was destroyed ! " The priest wiped one eye , then the other , with a white handkerchief . Two of the guards standing nearest the fixer edged away from him . But then Yakov cried out , " It 's all a fairy tale , every bit of it . Who could ever believe such a thing ? Not me ! " His voice quavered and his face was bloodless . " Those who can understand will believe , " said the priest. 134 135 " Be respectful if you know what 's good for you , " Grubeshov said heatedly in an undertone . " Listen and learn ! " " How can it be so if the opposite is true , " the fixer shouted , his throat thick . " It 's all right to theorize with a fact or two but I do n't recognize the truth in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everybody knows the Bible forbids us to eat blood . That 's all over the book , in the laws and everything . I 've forgottenmost of what I knew about the sacred books , but I 've lived among the people and know their customs . Many an egg my own wife would throw out to the goat if it had the smallest spot of blood on the yolk . ' Raisl , ' I said , ' take it easy . We ca n't afford to live like kings , ' but there was no getting the egg back on the table , either by hook or by crook , once she took it off , even admitting anyone wanted to , which I never did  --  you get used to the customs . What she did was final , your reverence . I never said , ' Bring back the bloody egg , ' and she would have thrown it at me if I had . She also soaked for hours the little meat or chicken we ate , to wash out every fleck of blood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure she had drained out every last drop . The rinsings with water were endless . That 's the truth of it , I swear . I swear I 'm innocent of this crime you say I did , not you personally , your reverence , but some of the officialshere . I 'm not a Hasid and I 'm not a tzadik . I 'm a fixer by trade , it 's a poorer trade than most , and formerlyfor a short time I was a soldier in the Imperial Army . In fact , to tell the whole truth , I 'm not a religious man , I 'm a freethinker . At first my wife and I quarreled about this but I said a man 's religion is his own business , and that 's all there is to it , if you 'll pardon me for saying so , your reverence . Anyway , I never touched that boy or any boy in my life . I was a boy myself once and it 's a time I find hard to forget . I 'm affectionate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife had given birth to a child . It 's not in my nature to do anythingsuch as has been described , and if anyone thinks so it 's mistaken identity for sure . " He had turned to the officials . They had listened courteously , even the two Black Hundreds representatives , though the shorter of them could not hide the distaste he felt for the fixer . The other now walked away . One man in a round cloth cap smiled sweetly at Yakov , then gazed impassively into the far distance where the golden cupolasof a cathedral rose above the trees . " You 'd be better off confessing , " Grubeshov said , " instead of raising this useless stink . " He asked the priest 's pardon for his language . " Confessing what , your honor , if as I told you I did n't do it ? I can confess to you some things but I ca n't confess this crime . You 'll have to excuse me there  --  I did n't do it . Why would I do such a thing anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a serious mis-take . " But no one would admit it and a heavy sadness settled on him . " Confessing how it was done , " Grubeshov replied . " How you enticed the boy into the stable with sweets , and then two or three of you pounced on him , gagged his mouth , tied him hand and foot , and dragged him up the stairs to your habitat . There you prayed over him with those black hats and robes on , undressed the frightened child , and began to stab him in certain places , twelve stabs first , then another making thirteen wounds  --  thirteen each in the region of the heart , on the neck , from which most of the blood is drawn , and on the face  --  according to your cabalistic books . You tormented and terrified him , enjoying the full shuddering terror of the child victim and his piteous pleas for mercy , in the meanwhile collecting his dripping lifeblood into bottlesuntil you had bled him white . The five or six litres of warm blood you put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand the custom , was delivered by a hunchbackJew to the synagogue in time for making the matzos and afikomen . And when poor Zhenia Golov 's heart was drained of blood and he lay on the floor lifeless , you and the tzadik Jew with the white stockings picked him up and carried him here in the dead of night and left his corpse in the cave . Then you both ate bread and salt so that his ghost would not haunt you and hurriedaway before the sun rose . Fearing the discovery of the bloodstains on your floor , you later sent one of your Jews to burn down Nikolai Maximovitch 's stable . That is what you ought to confess . " The fixer , moaning , wrung his hands and beat them against his chest . He looked for Bibikov but the InvestigatingMagistrate and his assistant had disappeared . " Take him up to the cave , " Grubeshov ordered the guards . Shutting his umbrella , he quickly preceded them , scampering up the steps , and entered the cave . The leg chains were too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was seized under the arms by two of the gendarmes and dragged and pushed up , the other guards following directly behind . Then one guard went into the cave and the others shoved the fixer in through the narrowstone opening . Inside the dank cave , smelling of death , in the dim light of a semicircle of dripping candles fastened on the wall , Grubeshov produced Yakov 's tool sack . " Are n't these your tools , Yakov Bok ? They were found in your habitat in the stable by the driver Rich-ter . " Yakov identified them in the candlelight . " Yes , your honor , I 've had them for years . " " Look at this rusty knife and these awls cleansed ofblood with this rag , and now deny these instruments were used by you and your gang of Jews to perforate and bleed the body of a sweet and innocent Christian child ! " The fixer forced himself to look . He gazed at the gleaming point of the awl , and beyond it , into the depths of the cave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them Marfa Golov , her head wrapped in a black shawl , her wet eyes reflecting the candle lights , wailing on her knees at the bier of her Zhenia , disinterred from his grave for the occasion , lying naked in death , the wounds of his gray shrunken pitiful body visible in the light of two long thickly dripping white candles burning at his large head and small feet . Yakov hastily counted the wounds on the child 's bloated face , and cried out , " Fourteen ! " But the Prosecuting Attorney replied these were two magic groups of seven , and Father Anastasy , the stink of garlic rising from his head , fell on his knees and with a quiet moan began to pray . VThe days were passing and the Russian officials were waiting impatiently for his menstrual period to begin . Grubeshov and the army general often consulted the calendar . If it did n't start soon they threatened to pump blood out of his penis with a machine they had for that purpose . The machine was a pump made of iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being drained out . The danger of it was that it did n't always work right and sometimes sucked every drop of blood out of the body . It was used exclusively on Jews ; only their penises fitted it . In the morning the guards came into the cell and awakened him roughly . He was searched carefully and140 141ordered to dress . Yakov was manacled and chained , then marched up two flights of stairs  --  he had hoped to Bibikov'soffice but it was to the Prosecuting Attorney 's across the hall . In the anteroom , on a bench against the wall in the rear two men in threadbare suits looked up furtively at the prisoner , then lowered their eyes . They are spies , he thought . Grubeshov 's office was a large high-ceilinged room with a long ikon of a crucified bluehaloedChrist on the wall behind the prosecutor 's desk , where he sat reading legal documents and referring to open law books . The fixer was ordered to sit in a chair facing Grubeshov , and the guards lined up behind him . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat . The prosecutor wore a light greenish suit with the same soiled yellow vest and black bow tie . His sidewhiskers were brushed , and he mopped his moist face and palms and wiped the back of his heavy neck with a large handkerchief . Yakov , disturbed by his bad dream of that morning , and almost unable to look at the Prosecuting Attorney since his performance at the cave , felt he was suffocating . " I have decided to send you to the preliminary confinementcell in the Kiev Prison to await your trial , " Grubeshov said , blowing his nose and cleaning it slowly . " It is , of course , not easy to predict when it will begin , so I thought I would inquire whether you had become more cooperative ? Since you have had time to reflect on your situation , perhaps you are now willing to tell the truth . What do you say ? Further resistance will gain you only headaches . Cooperation will perhaps ease your situ-ation . " " What else is there to say , your honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked in my small bag of words and I have nothing more to say except that I 'm innocent . There 's no evidence against me , because I did n't do what you say I did . " " That 's too bad . Your role in this murder was known to us before you were arrested . You were the only Jew living in the district , with the exceptions of Mandelbaumand Litvinov , Merchants of the First Guild , who were n't in Russia during the time of the commission of the crime , perhaps on purpose . We suspected a Jew at once because a Russian could n't possibly commit that kind of crime . He might cut a man 's throat in a fight , or suddenly kill a person with two or three heavy blows , but no Russian would maliciously torture an innocent child by inflicting forty-seven deadly wounds on his body . " " Neither would I , " said the fixer . " It 's not in my nature , whatever else is . " " The weight of the evidence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , your honor ? " " Evidence is evidence , it ca n't be wrong . " Grubeshov 's voice became persuasive . " Tell me the honest truth , Yakov Bok , did n't the Jewish Nation put you up to this crime ? You seem like a serious person  --  perhaps you were unwilling to do it but they urged it on you , made threats or promises of certain sorts , and you reluctantly carried out the murder for them ? To put it in other words , was n't it their idea rather than yours ? If you 'll admit that , I 'll tell you frankly  --  I ' 11 put it this way  --  your life would be easier . We will not prosecute to the full extent of our powers . Perhaps after a short while you will be paroled and your sentence suspended . In other words , there are possibilities . ' All we ask is your signature  --  that 's not so much . " Grubeshov 's face glistened , as though he were making a greater effort than was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your honor ? I could n't do such a thing . Why should I blame it on innocent people ? " " History has proved they are not so innocent . Besides I do n't understand your false scruples . After all , you're142 - 143an admitted freethinker , this admission occurred in my presence . The Jews mean very little to you . I size you up as a man who is out for himself , though I ca n't blame you . Come , here is an opportunity to free yourself from the confines of the net you have fallen into . " " If the Jews do n't mean anything to me , then why am I here ? " " You are foolish to lend yourself to their evil aims . What have they done for you ? " " At the very least , your honor , they 've let me alone . No , I could n't sign such a thing . " " Then keep in mind that the consequences for you can be very grave . The sentence of the court will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the fixer , breathing heavily , " do you really believe those stories about magicians stealing the blood out of a murdered Christian child to mix in with matzos ? You are an educated man and would surely not believe such superstitions . " Grubeshov sat back , smiling slightly . " I believe you killed the boy Zhenia Golov for ritual purposes . When they know the true facts , all Russia will believe it . Do you believe it ? " he asked the guards . The guards swore they did . " Of course we believe it , " Grubeshov said . " A Jew is a Jew , and that 's all there is to it . Their history and characterare unchangeable . Their nature is constant . This has been proved in scientific studies by Gobineau , Chamberlain and others . We here in Russia are presentlypreparing one on Jewish facial characteristics . Our peasants have a saying that a man who steals wears a hat that burns . With a Jew it is the nose that burns and revealsthe criminal he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pen-and-ink sketches , turning the book so that Yakov could read the printing at the top of the page : " Jewish noses . " " Here , for instance , is yours . " Grubeshov pointed to a thin high-bridged nose with slender nostrils . " And this is yours , " Yakov said hoarsely , pointing to a short , fleshy , broad-winged nose . The Prosecuting Attorney , though his color had deepened , laughed thinly . " You are a witty man , " he said , " but it wo n't do you any good . Your fate is foreseen . Ours is a humane society but there are ways of punishing hardened criminals . Perhaps I ought to remind you  --  to show you how well off you are  --  how your fellow Jews were executed in the not too distant past . They were hanged wearing caps full of hot pitch and with a dog hanging beside them to show the world how despised they were . " " A dog hangs a dog , your honor . " " If you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his neck inflamed , slashed the fixer across the jaw with a ruler . Yakov cried out as the wood snapped , one piece hitting the wall . The guards began to beat his head with their fists but the Prosecuting Attorney waved them away . " You can cry to Bibikov from now to doomsday , " he shouted at the fixer , " but I 'll keep you in prison till the flesh rots off your bones piece by piece . You will beg uie to let you confess who compelled you to murder that innocentboy ! " 2He feared the prison would go badly for him and it went badly at once . It 's my luck , he thought bitterly . What do they say ?  --  " If I dealt in candles the sun would n't set . " Instead , I 'm Yakov Fixer and it sets each hour on the stroke . I 'm the kind of man who finds it perilous to be alive . One thing I must learn is to say less  --  much less , or I 'll ruin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 145The Kiev Prison , also in the Lukianovsky , was a highwalledold gray fortress-like building with a large interiormuddy yard , strewn on the iron gate side with junk piles  --  a broken wagon , rotting mattresses , blackened boards , barrels of rubbish , rock and sandpiles where prisoners sometimes worked with cement . A clear area between the administrative offices on the west and the main cell block was the promenade grounds . Yakov and his guards had got to the prison on a trolley , a ride of several versts from the District Courthouse where he had been in jail until then . At the prison the fixer was greeted by the cross-eyed warden , " Hello , blooddrinker , welcome to the Promised Land . " The Deputy Warden , a lean , narrow-faced man with depthless eyes and a four-fingered right hand , said , " Here we 'll feed you flour and blood till you shit matzos . " The subofficialsand clerks rushed out of their offices to see the Jew , but Warden Grizitskoy , a man of sixty-five , with a limp yellowish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a visored cap , shoved open a door and led the fixer into an inner office , where he sat down at his desk . " I do n't want your kind here , " he said , " but I have no choice in the matter . I 'm the Tsar 's servant and follow his orders faithfully . You are the lowest of Jewish scum  --  I 've read of your deeds  --  but nevertheless a charge of his Imperial Majesty Nicholas the Second . So here you 'll stay till they tell me otherwise . You 'd better behave yourself . Follow the rules and regulations and do as you 're told . Quickly does it . Under no circumstances are you to attempt to communicate with any person outside this prison unless I authorize it . If you make trouble you will be shot in your tracks . Understood ? " " How long must I stay here ? " Yakov managed to ask . " I mean considering I have n't yet been tried . " " As long as the proper authorities deem necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the sergeant . He will tell you what to do . " The sergeant , a man with drooping mustaches , led the fixer down the corridor past some dingy offices from whose doorways the clerks were staring out , to a long room with a counter and several benches where he was ordered to undress . Yakov changed into a sack-like white jacket , smelling of human sweat , and a pair of shapeless linen trousers . He was handed a shirt without buttons and a worn greatcoat that had once been brown and was now gray , to sleep in or under at night . As he was pullingoff his boots to change into a pair of stiff prison shoes , a wave of oppressive darkness swept over him . Though he felt like fainting he would n't give them the satisfaction . " Sit down in that chair for your haircut , " the sergeant ordered . Yakov sat down in a straightback chair , but as the prison barber was about to crop his hair with a pair of large clippers , the sergeant , checking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . The orders say let him keep his head of hair . " " It 's always like that , " said the barber , incensed . " These pricks are born with privileges . " " Cut it off ! " shouted Yakov , " cut off my hair ! " " Silence ! " ordered the sergeant . " Learn to follow orders ! Move on ! " He unlocked a metal door with a large key and followed the fixer down a dimly lit dank corridor to a large crowded cell with a barred grating on one side , and a wall on the other containing two high small dirty windowsthrough which little light penetrated . A smelly urinal , no more than an open drain , ran along the rear wall of the cell . " It 's the thirty-day cell , " said the sergeant . " You stay146 147here for a month and either you go on trial or they transferyou elsewhere . " " Where elsewhere ? " " You 'll find out . " Wherever it is what difference does it make ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quieted as the door clanked open , and the silence deepened as though a quilt had been thrown over the prisoners as they watched Yakov enter . After the door shut behind him they began talkingand moving again . There were about twenty-five men in the room , their searing stench in the almost airlesscell nauseating . Some sat on the floor playing cards , two men danced closely together , a few wrestled or sparred , fell over each other , got kicked and cursed at . An old fanatic jumped repeatedly from the seat of a broken stool . A man with a sick sunken face hammered his shoe with the heel of another . There were a few benches and tables in the cells but no cots or mattresses . The prisoners slept on a low wooden platform along the outer wall , raised a centimeter from the damp filthy floor . Yakov sat alone in the farthest corner , reflecting on his wretched fate . He would have torn out fistfuls of his hair but was afraid to be noticed. 3A guard with a gun outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the cell door and deliveredthree steaming wooden pails of soup . The prisonersran with a roar to the pails , crowding around each . Yakov , who had eaten nothing that day , got up slowly . A guard handed out a wooden spoon to one prisoner in each group around the three pails . Sitting on the floor before his pail , the prisoner was allowed to eat ten spoonfuls of the watery cabbage soup , thickened with abit of barley , then had to pass the spoon to the next one in line . Those who tried to take extra spoonfuls were beaten by the others . After each prisoner had had his quota , the first began again . Yakov edged close to the nearest pail but the one eatingthe soup , a clubfoot with a scarred head , stopped spooning , reached into the pail , and with a shout of triumphplucked out half a dead mouse , its entrails hanging . The prisoner held the mouse by the tail , hastily spooning down the soup with his other hand . Two of the prisoners violently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from the pail . The clubfoot limped over to the men at the next pail and dangled the mouse in front of their faces , but though they cursed him into the ground no one left the pail . So he clumsily danced around with his dead mouse . Yakov glanced into the secondpail , already empty except for a few dead cockroachesfloating at the bottom . He did not look into the third pail . Nor did he care for the colorless tea that was served in tin mugs without sugar . He had hoped for a bit of bread but was given none because his name had not been entered on the bread list by the sergeant . That night when the other prisoners were snoring side by side on the platform , the fixer , wrapped in his greatcoat , though it was not a cold night , walked back and forth the length of the cell in the thick dark until the nails in his shoes bit into his feet . When he lay down exhausted , covering his face with half a sheet of newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flies , he was at once awakened by the clanging bell . At breakfast he gulped down the weak tea that smelled like wood rotting but could not touch the waterygray gruel in the pails . He had heard the wooden pails were in use in the bathhouse when they were not filled with soup or gruel . He asked for bread but the guard said he was still not on the list . " When will I be ? " 148 149 " Fuck you , " said the guard . " Do n't make trouble . " The fixer noticed that the mood of the prisoners to him , neutral to begin with , had altered . The men were quieter , subdued . During the morning they congregated in groups close to the urinal , whispering , casting glances at Yakov . The clubfoot from time to time appraised him with shrewd and cunning eyes . Yakov felt icicles sprout in his blood . Something has happened , he thought . Maybe somebody told them who I am . If they think I killed a Christian boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should he cry out to the guard and ask to be transferred to another cell before they murdered him in this ? And if he did would he live long enough to get there ? Suppose the prisoners rushed him and the guards made no move to defend him ? During the morning " promenade , " the ten-minute exercise break when the men marched in double lines of twelve around the yard , ten paces between each group , as armed guards , some with coiled bullwhips , stood at the foot of the high thick walls , the clubfoot , who had slipped into line next to Yakov , said in a whisper , " Why is n't your head shaved like the rest of us ? " " I do n't know , " Yakov whispered . " I told the barber to go ahead and do it . " " Are you a stool pigeon or squealer ? The men are suspicious of you . " " No , no , tell them I 'm not . " " Then why do you sit apart from us ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To tell the truth my feet hurt in these shoes . Also it 's my first time in prison . I 'm trying to get used to it but it 's not so easy . " " Are you expecting any food packages ? " asked the clubfoot . " Who would send me packages ? I have nobody to sendme a package . My wife left me . Everyone I know is poor . " " Well , if you get one , share and share alike is my motto . That 's the rule here . " " Yes , yes . " The clubfoot limped along in silence . They do n't know who I am , Yakov thought . From now on I 'd better be sociable . Once they find out it will be blows , not questions . But when the prisoners had marched back into the cell there were whispered arguments among them , and Yakov , remembering how he had been beaten in the District Courthouse cell , felt himself sweating hotly . Afterwards , another prisoner , a tall man with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and approachedYakov . He was heavily built , with a pale hard intense face , an almost black neck , and thin bent legs . He walked forward slowly , oddly , as though afraid somethingmight fall out of his clothes . The fixer , sitting on the floor with his back to the wall , scrambled up quickly . " Listen , little brother , " the other prisoner began , " I am Fetyukov . The prisoners have sent me to talk to you . " " If you 're worried that I 'm a stool pigeon , " Yakov said hastily , " you 've got the wrong worry . I 'm here like everybody else , waiting for my trial . I have n't asked for any privileges , not that they would give me any . I 'm not even getting a bread ration . As for my hair , I told the barber to go ahead and cut it off but the sergeant said not to , though do n't ask me why . " " What are you accused of ? " The fixer touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused me of I did n't do . I give you my word . It 's too complicated to go into without turning it into a wearying tale , something I do n't understand my-self. " 150 151 " I 'm a murderer , " said Fetyukov . " I stabbed a strangerat the inn in my village . He provoked me so I stabbed him twice , once in the chest , and when he was falling , once in the back . That was the end of him . I had had more than a drop or two , but when they told me what I had done I was greatly surprised . I 'm a peaceful man , I never make trouble if you do n't provoke me . Who would 've thought I could murder anybody ? If you had told me any such thing I would have laughed at you to your face . " The fixer , staring at the murderer , edged sideways along the wall . At the same time he saw two other prisonerssneaking up on him , one from either side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whipping a short heavy stick out of his trousers . He struck Yakov a hard blow on the head . The fixer went down on one knee , holding both hands over his pain-wracked , bloody head , then fell over . He awoke , lying on the clammy wooden platform . His head ached sickeningly and a searing pain throbbed on the left side of his skull . His fingers sought out the wet swollen cut on his scalp . Blood dripped from it . He was anguished . Would he be beaten every time he was moved to another cell and met other prisoners ? The fixer dizzily sat up , blood trickling down his face . " Wipe it off , " advised an old man with cracked eyeglasses , peering down at him . It was the slop-pail man who took care of the excrement buckets , brought in drinking water , and occasionally swept the wet floor . " Use the water bucket by the door . " " Why do you hit a man who has done nothing to you ? What have I done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old man whispered , " wash the blood off before the guard comes or the men will kill you . " " Let them kill me , " he shouted . " I told you he 's a shitnose squealer , " the clubfoot said from the other side of the cell . " Finish him off , Fetyu-kov . " A nervous murmur rose among the prisoners . Two guards came running in the corridor , one carrying a shotgun . They peered through the grating . " What 's going on here ? Cut out the noise , you pigs , or you 'll live on half rations for a week . " The other guard stared through the barred grating into the gloomy cell . " Where 's the Jew ? " he called . There was dead silence . The prisoners looked among themselves ; some glanced furtively at Yakov . After a while Yakov said he was there . A low murmur came from the prisoners . The guard pointed a shotgun at them and the murmur ceased . " Where ? " said the guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , " said Yakov . " There 's nothing to see . " " The sergeant wrote your name on the bread list . You 'll get your six ounces tonight . " " In the meantime you can dream of matzos , " said the guard with the gun . " Also the blood of Christian martyrs , if you know what I mean . " When the guards left the prisoners talked excitedly among themselves . Yakov felt renewed fright . Fetyukov , the murderer , approached again . The fixer rose tensely , his hand clawing the wall . " Are you the Jew they say has murdered a Russian lad ? " " They lie , " Yakov said hoarsely , " I 'm innocent . " The mutterings of the prisoners filled the cell . One of them shouted , " Jew bastard ! " " That 's not why I hit you , " said Fetyukov . " Your head was n't shaved and we thought you were a spy . We did it to see if you would report us to the guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you off . The clubfoot152 153would have knifed you . We are going on trial and do n't want anybody testifying what he has heard in this cell . I did n't know you were a Jew . But if I had I would n't have hit you . When I was a boy I was apprenticed to a Jew blacksmith . He would n't have done what they say you did . If he drank blood he would have vomited it up . And he would n't have harmed a Christian child . I 'm sorry I hit you , it was a mistake . " " It was a mistake , " said the clubfoot . Yakov went unsteadily to the water bucket . The bucket stank but he sank to his knees and poured some water over his head . After that the prisoners lost interest in him and turned to other things . Some of them went to sleep on the platform and some played cards . That night Fetyukov woke the fixer and gave him a piece of sausage he had saved from a package his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The murderer also handed him a wet rag to press down the swollen cut on his head . " Tell the truth , " he whispered , " did you kill that lad ? Maybe you did it for a different reason ? You might have been drunk . " " For no other reason , " Yakov said . " And I was n't drunk . It never happened , I 'm innocent . " " I wish I were innocent , " sighed Fetyukov . " It was a terrible thing I did . The man was a stranger to me . One must protect strangers , it says so in the Book . I had had a drop , you understand , and the next thing I knew I grabbed up a knife and he was dead at my feet . God , who gives us life , lets it hang by a thread . One blow and it 's torn away . Do n't ask me why unless the devil is the stronger . If I could give that man his life again I would . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me again . I do n't know why I did it but I do n't want to be a murderer . Things are bad enough as they are , who needsworse ? Now they 'll pack me off to a prison camp in Siberiaand if I live out my term I 'll have to stay there the rest of my days . " Little brother , " he said to Yakov , making the sign of the cross over him , " do n't lose hope . The stones of the bridge may crumble but the truth will come out . " " And till then , " sighed the fixer , " what of my wasted youth ? " 4His youth dribbled away . He had been imprisoned almost three months , three times longer than Bibikov had predicted and God only knew when it would end . Yakov nearly went mad trying to figure out what was happening to him . What was a poor harmless fixer doing in prison ? What had he done to deserve this terrible incarceration , no end in sight ? Had n't he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than just world ? He tried desperately to put together a comprehensible sequence of events that had led inevitablyfrom his departure from the shtetl to a prison cell in Kiev ; but to think of all these strange and unexpected experiences as meaningfully caused by related events confused him . True , the world was the kind of world it was . The rain put out fires and created floods . Yet too much had happened that did n't make sense . He had committed a few errors and paid for them in more than kind . One dark night a thick black web had fallen on him because he was standing under it , and though he ran in every direction he could not extricate himself from its sticky coils . Who was the spider if it remained invisible ? He sometimes thought God was punishing him for his unbelief . He was , after all , the jealous God . " Thou shalt worship no other Gods before me , " not even no Gods . He also blamed the goyim for their eter-154 155nal hatred of Jews . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , God or no God , forever . Did it have to be so ? And he continued to curse himself . It could have happened to a more dedicated Jew , but it had happened instead to a recent freethinker because he was Yakov Bok . He blamed his usual mistakes  --  he could not always tell those of the far-off past from those that had led directly to his arrest in the brickyard . Yet he knew there was something from the outside , a quality of fate that had stalked him all his life and threatened , if he was n't careful , his early extinction . He hungered to explain who he was , Yakov the fixer from a small town in the Pale , an orphan boy who had married Raisl Shmuel 's and had been deserted by her , a curse on her soul ; who had been poor all his life , had grubbed for a living , and was poor in other ways too  --  if he was that one what was he doing in prison ? Who were they punishing if his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prison with thick stone walls ? He thought of begging them to let him go simply because he was not a criminal  --  it was a known fact  --  they could ask in the shtetl . If any of the officials  --  Grubeshov , Bodyansky , the warden  --  had known him before , they would never have believed he could commit such a monstrous crime . Not such as he . If only his innocence were written on a sheet of paper , he could pull it out and say , " Read , it 's all here , " but since it was hidden in himself they would know it only if they sought it , and they were not seeking . How could anyone look twice at Marfa Golov , note her suspicious ways and those crazy cherries on her hat , and not suspect she knew more about the murder than she was willing to admit ? And what had happened to the Investigating Magistrate whom he had n't seen now in more than a month ? Was he still loyal to the law , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fora guilty Jew ? Or had he merely forgotten an expendable man ? During Yakov 's first days in the courthouse jail the ac- cusation had seemed to him almost an irrelevancy , noth- ing much to do with his life or deeds . But after the visit to the cave he had stopped thinking of relevancy , truth , or even proof . There was no " reason , " there was only their plot against a Jew , any Jew ; he was the accidental choice for the sacrifice . He would be tried because the accusation had been made , there did n't have to be an- other reason . Being born a Jew meant being vulnerable to history , including its worst errors . Accident and his- tory had involved Yakov Bok as he had never dreamed he could be involved . The involvement was , in a way of speaking , impersonal , but the effect , his misery and suffering , were not . The suffering was personal , painful , and possibly endless . He felt entrapped , abandoned , helpless . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend knew it . Nobody . The fixer berated himself for not hav- ing listened to Shmuel 's advice and staying where he be- longed . He had got himself in a terrible mess , for what ? Opportunity ? An opportunity to destroy himself . He had fished for a herring and had been snatched by a shark . It was n't hard to guess which of them would eat meat . And though he had now , at last , a little under- standing of what was going on , or thought he had , he could of course still not resign himself to what had hap- pened . In a philosophical moment he cursed history , anti-Semitism , fate , and even , occasionally , the Jews . " Who will help me ? " he cried out in his sleep , but the other prisoners had their own anguish , their own bad dreams . One night a new guest was let into the cell , a fattish heavy-faced young man with a blondish beard and small156 - 157hands and feet , who wore his own clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furtive glances to anyone who looked in his direction . Yakov observed him from the distance . The young man was the only fat one in a cellful of skinny prisoners . He had money , bribed the guards for favors , lived well on packages from the outside  --  two large ones in a week  --  and was n't stingy with food or cigarettes . " Here , boys , eat hearty , " and he would hand out whatever there was to spare , yet keep himself well supplied . He even passed around green bottles of mineral water . He seemed to know how to get along , and some of the prisoners played cards with him . The clubfoot offered to be his personal servant but he waved him away . At the same time he was a worried man , muttered to himself , shook his head in disagreement , and sometimes tore at his round wrists with dirty fingernails . One by one he pulled off the buttons of his shirt . Yakov , though wanting to talk to the man , skirted him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say to people with money , partly because the man obviously did n't want to be bothered , and partly for reasons he could not explain to himself . The new prisoner dispensed his favors with pretended cordiality , his eyes unable to conceal the fact that he was not a cordial man , and then withdrew . He sat alone often , muttering . Yakov sensed this one was aware of him . They both minded their business and looked each other over . One morning , after the promenade in the prison yard , they began to talk in a corner of the cell . " You 're a Jew ? " said the fat young man , in Yiddish . Yakov admitted it . " I , too . " " I thought so , " said the fixer . " If you thought so why did n't you come over ? " " I thought I 'd wait a little . " " What 's your name ? " " Yakov Bok the fixer . " " Gronfein , Gregor . Shalom . What are you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian child . " He still could n't say it keeping his voice steady . Gronfein looked at him in astonishment . " So you 're the one ? My God , why did n't you tell me right away ? I 'm happy to be in the same cell with you . " " Why should you be happy ? " " I heard they had accused somebody of killing the Russian boy they found in the cave . Of course the whole thing is a manufactured fake , but there 's a rumor running around in the Podol that a Jew was arrested , though nobody has seen you or knows who . Whoever he is he 's a martyr for us all . Is it really you ? " " It 's me , I wish it was n't . " " I had my doubts that such a person exists . " " Only that and no more , " the fixer sighed . " My worst enemies should exist like this . " " Do n't grieve , " said Gronfein . " God will help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it suits him , but if he does n't I hope somebody else will soon , or they might as well put me in the ground and cover me up with earth and grass . " " Patience , " Gronfein said absently . " Patience . If there 's not one way , there 's another . " " Another what ? " " As long as a man stays alive he ca n't tell what chances will pop up next . But a dead man signs no checks . " He began to talk about himself . " Of course I 'm better off than some I can think of , " Gronfein said , looking at Yakov to see if he agreed . " I have a first-class lawyer alreadyworking for me in what you could call unofficial ways , and I 'm not afraid to part with a few hundred rubles if I have to , because there 's more where they come from . What I do is I 'm a counterfeiter . It 's not honest but pays well , and so what if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he takes from the Jews. 158Still , if a bribe does n't work this time I do n't know what will . I 've got a wife and five children and I 'm getting a little worried . This is the longest I 've spent in a cell . How long have you been here yourself ? " " Here about a month . Altogether three months since I was arrested . " " Whew . " The counterfeiter gave Yakov two cigarettes and a piece of apple strudel from his last package , and the fixer ate and smoked gratefully . Next time they talked , Gronfein asked Yakov questionsabout his parents , family , and village . He wanted to know what he had been doing in Kiev . Yakov told him this and that but not too much . He did , however , mention Raisl , and Gronfein squirmed . " Not so much of a Jewish daughter I 'd say . My wife could n't have such thoughts , not with a goy anyway , let alone do such a thing . " The fixer shrugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some who do are Jewish . " Gronfein started to ask something , looked around cautiously , then whispered he would be interested in knowing what exactly had happened to the boy . " How did he die ? " " How did who die ? " the fixer said , astonished . " That Russian boy who was murdered . " " How would I know ? " He drew away from the man . " What they say I did I did n't do . If I were n't a Jew there 'd be no crime . " " Are you sure ? Why do n't you confide in me ? We 're both in the same pot . " " I have nothing to confide , " said Yakov coldly . " If there was no fowl there are no feathers . " " It 's tough luck , " said the counterfeiter amiably , " but I 'll do what I can to help you . Once they let me out of here I 'll speak to my lawyer . " " For that I 'll thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes clouding , and said no more . The next day he sidled up to Yakov and whispered , worried , " They say on the outside that if the governmentbrings you up on trial they might start a pogrom at the same time . The Black Hundreds are making terrible threats . Hundreds of Jews are leaving the city as if fleeingthe plague . My father-in-law is talking of selling his business and running to Warsaw . " The fixer listened in silence . " Nobody 's blaming you , you understand , " Gronfein said . " If your father-in-law wants to run away at least he can run away . " As they talked , the counterfeiter , from time to time , nervously glanced in the direction of the cell door , as if he were watching for the guard . " Are you expecting a package ? " Yakov asked . " No no . But if they do n't let me out of here I 'll soon go mad . It 's a stinking place and I 'm worried about my family . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remnants of a package . " Guard what 's left here , " he said to Yakov , " maybe I 'm getting some action after all . " A guard opened the door and Gronfein disappeared from the cell for half an hour . When he returned he told the fixer they were letting him out that evening . He seemed satisfied but his ears were flaming , and afterwardshe muttered much to himself for more than an hour . Later he was calmer . That 's how it goes with money , Yakov thought . If you 've got it you 've got wings . " Something I can do for you before I go ? " Gronfein whispered , slipping the fixer a ten-ruble note . " Do n't worry , it 's guaranteed good . "
