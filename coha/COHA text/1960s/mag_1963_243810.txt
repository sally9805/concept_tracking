Although medical science still can not pinpoint a cause for the vast majority of cases of high blood pressure , researchers are gradually narrowing the area of uncertainty . More and more cases can be effectively treated because they have been traced to disease of the kidneys or their arteries . Last week in the A.M.A. Journal . the University of Michigan 's Dr. Jerome W. Conn reported that one form of high blood pressure , generally considered to be rare , can now be cured by surgery . And it may , he suggests , be a more common form than most doctors suspect . <P> From the Bark . Endocrinologist Conn got his lead from what seemed like experiments in a torture chamber . To help the armed forces cut down World War II manpower losses from tropical heat prostration , he kept volunteers working at 90 F. and a relative humidity of 80% to 90% . After about a week , the men became acclimated to the artificial weather . <P> <P> But how ? Dr. Conn reasoned that a hormone must be at work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But nobody had identified a hormone with such precise effects . He could only guess that it was one of the many produced by the outer cortex or " bark " of the adrenal glands which are astride the kidneys . In the early 1950s , other investigators confirmed Conn 's hunch by isolating an adrenal hormone now called aldosterone and recognized as one of the most powerful of all the body 's chemicals . <P> Into the Cure Column . First patient to get the benefit of Dr. Conn 's aldosterone research was no tropic-bound G.I. , but a 34-year-old Michigan woman whose high blood pressure ( 170 over 100 ) was accompanied by unusual features . She had muscular weakness and cramps , had to drink and urinate frequently ; her low-salt sweat and abysmally low level of potassium in the blood indicated an excess of aldosterone . A medical team traced her trouble to a small tumor on her right adrenal gland , which was pumping out a flood of aldosterone although there was no excess of other adrenal hormones . Surgeons removed her tumor , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her blood pressure about normal . <P> ' ' How many such patients there are . " says Dr. Conn , " is anybody 's guess . " They run the gamut from those with strikingly severe symptoms to those detected only by chance chemical tests . And the picture is complicated because some victims of a rare , rapidly progressive and fatal form of high blood pressure develop an aldosterone excess apparently as an effect , rather than a cause , of their original disease . But whatever the statistics , the volunteers who pedaled themselves silly on Dr. Conn 's exercise bicycles have a good deal to show for their sweat . At least 70% of aldosterone-tumor patients are being cured by surgery , and of the 25% listed only as improved , some are expected to move into the cured column when their convalescence is complete .
