The occasion was scarcely expected to be lively . It was the annual shareholders ' meeting , in Glasgow , of Scottish and Universal Investments Ltd . <P> ( SUITS for short ) , the holding company for Sir Hugh Eraser 's vast assembly of Scottish and British department stores . Nor did the chairman 's report seem like a call for Scottish cheer . By paying out some $10 million , said Sir Hugh , he had acquired controlling interest in George Outram &; Co. , Ltd. , a prosperous Glaswegian publishing house that had not really been for sale . But once they heard the expensive word , the SUITS shareholders burst out in un-Caledonian glee . " For he 's a jolly good fellow , " they sang , in tribute to the man who , by buying Outram , had succeeded in his assigned task of preventing the world 's hungriest press lord from sitting down to his next chosen meal . <P> Landing in Edinburgh . The appetite belonged , of course , to Canadian-born Roy Thomson , 70 , Lord Thomson of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any other man . Perhaps because of his Scottish ancestry-his great-great-grandfather was born in Dumfriesshire-Thomson particularly fancies Scottish possessions . When his Canadian-based publishing empire crossed the Atlantic in 1954 , it landed first in Edinburgh , where Thomson bought The Scotsman , a morning daily . Since then , between forays on Fleet Street , London 's newspaper row , Thomson has added three more Scottish papers and an 80% interest in Scottish television to his empire . When Thomson made clear that he meant to buy up Outram , which publishes the Glasgow Herald ( circ. 254,000 ) , and half a dozen smaller papers , Outram 's board became more determined than ever that their Scottish papers should be owned by Scots . Sir Hugh Fraser was brought in for the express purpose of figuring out the tactics that might keep Thomson at bay . A Glaswegian by birth and heir to the family drapery , Sir Hugh had already proved his business cunning by expanding his inheritance into a chain of 70 stores all over the United Kingdom . Until two months ago , Sir Hugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per share , in cash , for Outram stock-a figure about 60 above the market and one that set a price tag on Outram of $15 million . Before long Thomson raised his bid to $18 million . Invoking a Shade . Over the next two months , Roy Thomson confidently raised his offer to an apparently un- matchable $25 million . But by then , although Thomson did not know it , the battle was ended . Over the same period , in his capacity as head of SUITS , Sir Hugh had been quietly buying Outram stock . Now he was the owner of a controlling 51% . " If Sir Hugh Fraser has won , " said Roy Thomson , with more vexation than grace , " the shareholders , Outram and Scotland itself will certainly have lost . " But this was a minority view . " What most impresses the Scots , " said London 's Financial Times , " is that Sir Hugh is prepared to lose money in Scottish causes .
