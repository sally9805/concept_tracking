Proponents and opponents of live-virus poliomyelitis vaccines , which are taken by mouth , got closer to the infighting last week . All the leading scientists involved on both sides of the struggle to displace the Salk killed-virus vaccine ( which must be injected ) appeared at research meetings in Atlantic City and Newark , N.J. , and nearly all took off the gloves . Government umpires looked on uncomfortably , dreading the day when they have to decide on licensing an oral vaccine . <P> Shift in Aim . Despite five years of intensive efforts to get everybody in the U.S. Salk-vaccinated ( about 300 million shots have been injected ) , 91 million people still have not had any vaccine . And paralytic polio has been increasing for two years . From 2,500 cases in 1957 it went up to 3,700 in 1958 and 5,500 in 1959 . Unaccountably , the disease has shifted its aim : young children , especially under two years old , are now the principal victims . They are concentrated in urban and . rural slums , among Negroes and Puerto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccination has been most neglected in these groups . But a major paradox is that , because of living conditions , these were formerly the groups in which harmless natural infection occurred most often , making paralytic disease rare . One suggestion : the wild viruses may be changing their way of life . The only thing certain is that polio is far from having been defeated . <P> Why ? Three doses of Salk vaccine are only 80% to 90% effective in conferring immunity , said two U.S. Public Health Service experts . Advocates of live-virus vaccines maintain that their preparations , taken in one or three doses , confer immunity in 90% or more of the vaccinated , as measured by laboratory tests of blood antibodies against polio viruses . But do the oral vaccines really give such a high proportional protection against paralysis ? And are they safe ? On these questions the scientists divided down the middle . <P> For the purists , Johns Hopkins University 's Dr. David Bodian said that there should be a clear showing , as in the Salk 1954 field trial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was exasperating to both the University of Cincinnati 's Dr. Albert B. Sabin and Lederle Laboratories ' Dr. Herald R. Cox , developers of two of three U.S. live vaccines . It is an impossible requirement , snapped Dr. Sabin , because by its very nature the oral , weakened virus is designed to multiply in the human digestive tract . It is bound to spread to unvaccinated contacts ( especially close kin ) of vaccinated subjects , and make some of them immune . So if the vaccine is effective , it will destroy the basis for such a comparison by protecting some of the unvaccinated . <P> Man &; Monkey . Both Sabin and Cox asserted that there is enough evidence from millions of oral vaccinations in a score of foreign countries to show that their vaccines are safe and sure. * But each insisted that his own was better than either of its two rivals . ( Dr. Sabin has attacked the third vaccine , developed by the Wistar Institute 's Dr. Hilary Koprowski , charging that it contains viruses that cause disease in monkeys and might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine in three separate doses a month apart-one for each main type of polio virus . Dr. Cox and colleagues give a single swig of trivalent vaccine .
