TRACK &; FIELD <P> He smokes cigarettes , downs his full share of red wine , and readily admits that he often stuffs himself on sauerkraut . He plays soccer for kicks and seldom exerts himself in training . He has no coach . " My principle , " explains French Distance Runner Michel Jazy , 29 , " is to do nothing contrary to the body . An athlete in shape is like a pregnant woman . One may indulge one 's tastes and be sure not to overdo . " <P> Mais oui ! Last week , before 3,000 wildly cheering countrymen at Rennes , he breezed through the mile in an astonishing 3 min. 53.6 sec. , chopping a full .5 sec. from the world record set last year by New Zealand 's Peter Snell . The week before , Jazy turned a 3-min. 55.5-sec. mile , the seventh fastest in history , and topped that by setting a new European record of 13 min. 34.4 sec. in the 5,000 meters , only 8.6 sec. off Australian Ron Clarke 's world mark . Late last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he missed by only 3.2 sec . <P> The curious thing is that Jazy runs best against nobody . Most runners find extra energy when a challenger pounds up alongside . Jazy freezes . He has won only a few major races against other stars , and finished a dismal fourth in the 5,000-meter run at the Tokyo Olympics . Few runners can match him when the pressure is off and he has some helpful " rabbits " to pace him . <P> At Rennes last week a French runner led him through a 57.3-sec. first quarter , a second rabbit helped him to a 1-min. 56.5-sec. half , a third man pushed him to 2 min. 57.2 sec. at the three-quarter mark . From there on , Jazy sprinted out ahead , finished with a dash that put him 45 yds. ahead . He then coolly noted that the footing on the track was poor be cause it had been chopped up by too many earlier races . " Without this , " he said , " I could have done 3 min. 52 sec.
