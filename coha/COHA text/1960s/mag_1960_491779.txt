The Shaming of Broken Horn She could n't have made a worse mistake : She insulted an Indian chief . By Bill Gulick Toward sundown of the second day after the train reached Fort Hall , Harlan Faber , elected wagon captain , called a meeting of the emigrant families , as was the custom when a question affecting them all had to be voted on . Well aware by now that this western land was a man 's land in which a woman must keep silent , Mary Bailey told her pa she guessed she 'd stay by their wagons and catch up on the mending . But her pa said , " You got a right to be there . I want you to help me make up my mind which way to vote . " " Your mind 's already made up , is n't it , pa ? " " I know what I 'd like to do , sure . But I want you at that meeting . Since your ma left us , you 've taken her place , seems like . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to keep her hands busy , standing at the edge of the crowd with her lanky , gray-haired , slow-spoken pa , Jed , and her younger brother , Mike , who was slim , dark-eyed and , at fourteen , beginning to consider himself an adult . Mary , a pretty , black-haired , graveyoung lady of eighteen , had put away childish notions years ago . Facing the crowd stood Harlan Faber . With him were Peter Kent , factor of Fort Hall ; Broken Horn , the fierce-eyed Bannock chief whose imperious edict had brought on this present crisis ; Tim Ramsey , guide for the wagon train ; and a pair of American trappers who had drifted into the trading post the day before . Faber raised his hand for silence . - You folks all know what this meeting 's about . The ( Continued on Page 91 ) trail forks hcrc . What we got to decide is whether we want to go on to Oregon , like we 'd planned , or change our plans and go to Californy . " As the wagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two American trappers curiously , for there were strange talcs of these wild , rootless men . Both wore ragged , grease-stained buckskins and had an alert , almost savage look about them . To the stooped , older man , Charley Huff , she gave no more than a brief glance ; but the younger man , Dave Allen , standing so tall and straight , was so handsome and had such nice gray eyes that she stared at him shamelessly . " If we go to Oregon , " Faber was saying , " we 'll have to pass through Bannock country . The Bannocks arc on the warpath against Americans , Broken Horn says , an ' will fight us every step of the way . Bul if we turn south an ' head fel . Californy , stayin ' clear of Bannock country , Broken Horn says his bucks wo n't pester us . That 's how matters stand . Speak up . men , an ' tell me how you feel . " One by one the men spoke their sentiments , while their womenfolk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary ? " " It 's up to you , pa . It 's whatever you 4 want to do . " " It 's the seedlings I 'm thinkin ' about . To bring a whole wagonload of ' cm this far , then give up ? " " Jed Bailey ! " Faber called out . " You got anything to say ? " New England born and bred , Jed shifted his weight from one foot to the other , cocked his head at the sky as if looking for sign of rain , then said slowly , " Does it freeze in Californy , come winter ? " Tim Ramsey said no it did n't , normally . Peter Kent and the two trappers agreed . Faber let his eyes run over the crowd . " Any more questions ' fore we take a vote ? " " Get on with it ! " a man shouted . " Call the roll ! " " All right . " Faber took a sheet of paper out of his pocket . " Joshua Partridge . " " Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blamed fool ! How do you vote ? " " Californy ! " " Frank Lutchcr . " " Californy ! " " Matthew Honleikcr . " " Californy ! " And so it went , down through the list , until forty-nine names had been called . Now , with only one name left , the wagon captain paused , looked at Jed , then said , " Jedidiah Bailey . " Jcd studied the blue sky and the far reach of parched land to the west . At last he said , " A man ca n't grow decent apples in country where it do n't freeze . " " That ai n't an answer , Jed . How do you vote ? " " Oregon . " Mary heard a murmuring run through the crowd . " Stubborn old fool .... Jed Bailey and his damned apple trees . . . . Let him git scalped .... " Faber tallied the list . " Results of the vote . Fer Californy , forty-nine . Fer Oregon , one . Majority rules , as agreed . We 'll pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He looked angrily at Jcd . " Forty-nine of us , anyhow . 1 wash my hands of you , Jcd Bailey . Mectin 's adjourned . " The Bailey family walked back to their wagons in silence , Mary feeling proud of her pa , but not knowing how to put it into words . Mike went out to check on the grazing mules . Jed took a pair of wooden buckets and headed for the creek to get water for the seedlings . Mary readied supper . It being early July , dark came late and though the sun had sunk by the time she called her menfolk to supper  --  a good meat slew tilled with fresh vegetables grown in the Fort Hall garden , baked beans sweetened with molasses , hot biscuits and dried-apple pie  --  there was still plenty of twilight left when they finished eating . Because she loved her pa and knew how worried he was , Mary treated him extra good . " More pie , pa ? " " Thank you kindly , Mary , but I reckon not . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine cook , girl , just like your ma was . The man that marries you will get a real prize . " " Fiddlesticks ! " Mary said , but the praise pleased her just the same . Lighting his pipe . Jed brooded into the fire while Mike got out cleaning stick , rag and oil and set to work cleaning his rifle . Busy with the dishes , Mary did not hear the visitors approach until Peter Kent said , " Good evening . Mr. Bailey . May I have a word with you ? " " Sure . What 's on your mind ? " Turning around , Mary got the fright of her life , for standing an arm 's reach away was that murderous-looking Indian , Broken Horn . Likely she would have screamed if she had n't looked past him and seen Charley Huff and Dave Allen . Dave Allen was smiling at her with those nice gray eyes , and somehow she knew nothing bad could happen when he was around . But watching Broken Horn sniff animal-like at the stew simmering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open Dutch oven , she did feel a mite uneasy . " You 're set on going to Oregon , I take it , " Kent said . " Do you plan to wait here until an Oregon-hound train willing to fight its way through Bannock country comes along ? " " Ca n't hardly do that . Ours was the last train due to leave Independence this season. - A questioning look came into Jed 's eyes . " You got a proposition , Mr. Kent ? " " Yes . Charley and Dave here also want to go to Oregon . I 'll vouch for their reliability , if you want to hire them as guides . I 've talked to Chief Broken Horn , and he 's agreed  --  for a reasonable consideration  --  to let you pass through his country . " " How much ? " " One hundred dollars . " " And these gents , how much do they want ? " " Two hundred dollars  --  apiece . " Jed fiddled with his pipe . " That 's a sight of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takin ' two wagons an ' three greenhorns through bad Injun country , " Charley grunted . " There 's one thing I must make clear , " Dave said , looking first at Mary , then at Jed . " If you do hire us , you 've got to do exactly as we tell you at all times . " That was a mighty bossy way for a mere guide to talk , Mary thought angrily . Finishing the dishes , she carried them to the wagon and put them away . As she turned back to the fire , her mouth flew open in horror . Chief Broken Horn , fascinated by the smell emanating from the stewpot , had lifted its lid and was plunging a dirty butcher knife into its depths . This time she did scream . " Stop that , you heathen ! " The Indian gave no sign that he heard her . Seizing the first weapon handy  --  a broom leaning against the wagon wheel  --  she made for him . As she raised the broom to strike , Dave Allen leaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ma'am ! " Paying no attention to the commotion , Chief Broken Horn sniffed at the piece of meat he had impaled on his knife , diagnosed it as edible and disposed of it at a single bite . Finding the sample good , he dipped his bare hand into the pot , gobbled down its contents , then , still masticating noisily , stooped and picked up the apple pie . Indignantly Mary struggled against the steel-like grip on her wrists . " Let me go ! " The nice gray eyes were n't smiling now . " Do n't you want to go to Oregon ? " " Of course I do ! " " You wo n't get there by beating Indian chiefs on the head with a broom . If you hit Broken Horn , he 'd be so insulted he 'd kill us all first chance he got ! " It was too late to save the pie anyway , so Mary let go of the broom . ' ' All right , Mr. Allen . I wo n't harm your precious Indian . Now let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , and he released her . " That 's better . " He turned to Jed . " Think you can control your daughter ? " 91 Jcd looked questioningly at Mary . Shamefaced , she dropped her gaze to the ground . She was still trembling with anger , not only at Chief Broken Horn but also at these two trappers who , to her way of thinking , were heartlessly taking advantage of her pa . Why , five hundred dollars was half of the family 's lifetime savings ! But this was a man 's world , and it was not her place to object . " I 'll make no trouble , pa . I promise . " " That 's sensible talk , " Dave said . He nodded to Jed . " It 's set , then . We 'll pull out first thing in the morning . " West of Fort Hall the trail followed Snake River across fiat , monotonous sagebrush desert , with mountains faint in the heat-hazed distance to the northwest and the green , swift-flowing river often lost deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , except when the road got too bad , at which times Dave would tic his saddle horse to the tail gate , climb to the driver 's seat and take the reins . He drove like he did everything else , with a casual skill which the mules recognized and responded to , though the stubborn brutes gave Mary all kinds of trouble . " Good mules , " he said , grinning at her as the wagon topped a particularly bad grade . " Flow come Jed was smart enough to use mules instead of oxen ? " " Pa is a smart man . " " What 's he going to do with those seedlings ' ? " " Raise apples . Back home he had the finest apple orchard in the state . " " Why did you leave ? " " Ma died a year ago , and it took the heart out of pa . He got restless , hearing about the free land in Oregon and how scarce fresh fruit was out there . He kept talking about it , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagon was on a perfectly level stretch of trail now , and there was no reason why Dave should n't turn the reins over to her , but he lingered . " Kind of hard on a woman , ai n't it , leaving her friends and all ? " " Pa and Mike are all that matter to me . " " Most girls your age think more of catching a husband than they do of their pa and brother . " The way he put it exasperated her . " You make getting married sound like trapping . " He threw back his head and laughed heartily . " I meant no offense . But judging from what I 've seen of women , most of ' em do have men on their minds when they get to be your age . " " I 'll bet they pestered you no end when you lived in civilized country . " " Well , they did , if you want the truth . " " Is that why you ran away and turned trapper ' ! " " Nope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the hill . " " Did you find out ? " " Sure . Another hill  --  with another side to it . " He stopped the wagon , handed her the reins and climbed down . Mounting his horse , he said with a grin . " Do n't say anything to those mules , gal . Maybe they 'll think I 'm still driving and wo n't give you no trouble. - Angrily she watched him gallop away . Then she gave the off-wheeler a lick with the whip that made him jump like he 'd been scalded . For a week they traveled west without molestation , save for the torment of heat , dust and monotony . Dave said the fact that they saw no Indians did n't mean the Indians had n't seen them . Chief Broken Horn had ridden ahead , he said , to warn his people ( Continued on Page 94 ) ( Conriomed from Page I ) that the party of whites was coming : and scouts watch-mg from ridge tops likely were noting the progress of the wagons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " till we 're into the Blue Mountains . And we 'll have company before we get out of Bannock country , you can bet on that . When we do , Charley and l will tell you how to behave . Make sure you listen . " The two trappers had brought along several extra horses to pack their gear , and when Charley suggested that one of the animals ' load be stowed in a wagon , freeing the horse for Mike to ride and accompany him on hunts for fresh meat , the old trapper made himself a friend for life . From dawn till dusk , Mike tagged after Charley , listening with youthful awe to Charley 's rambling tales of beaver trapping , Indian fighting and wilderness adventures . Mary was aware of the relationship that existed between boy and man , but she saw no harm in it . One evening they camped in a grassy swale bare of trees , with the river five hundred feet below . It was quite a chore lugging up water for the seedlings ; and by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He lay down on the ground with a weary sigh . " Jehoshaphat , I 'm tired ! Hungry too . What 's for supper , Mary ? " Mary was exhausted ; the Fuel was scant , and %%hat there was of it refused to burn . " Nothing , " she said shortly , " unless somebody fetches me some decent firewood . " " Mike , " Jed said , " cut your sister some wood . Hustle , now ! " Charley and Mike were squatting nearby , the old trapper rambling on while the boy listened intently . Mary gave her brother a sharp look . " Mike ! " " H'nFm ? " " Did you hear your pa ? " hat 'd he say ? " " He told you to fetch me some firewood . " " Aw , fetch it yourself . That 's squaw work . " Mary stared at her brother . Jed sat up with a scowl . " What did you say , son ? " Mike flushed , gave Charley a sidelong glance and muttered , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charley ? " " Why , yeah , boy , " Charley answered , scratching his ribs . " Amongst Injuns , that 's how it is . The buck kills the game an ' brings it home , an ' his squaw skins an ' cooks it . " Dave , who had just strolled up , looked at Mike and said , " Do n't believe everything Charley tells you , son . " " But Charley knows all about squaws ! " Mike said indignantly . " He 's had dozens of ' ern ! . . Have n't you , Charley ' ? " " Wal , not dozens ? " Mary put her hands on her hips . " I never heard the like ! Stuffing a boy full of awful stories ! " " Mike , fetch Mary some wood , " Dave said firmly . " Jump , now ! . . . Charley , you help him . " Charley looked hurt . " Mc ? Me fetch wood ? " " If you want to eat , you 'd better . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down on a boulder overlooking the whispering river . Though she 'd promised her pa she 'd make no trouble , the chore of feeding four hungry , ungrateful men three times a day was getting on her nerves ; and she knew if she had to listen to any more of their idle chatter , she 'd likely bust loose and say something she 'd regret . Hearing a quiet step behind her , she looked around . Dave had followed her . " Nice night . " " Yes . " " You 'd ought not to wander away from camp atone . Some lnjun might see you and pack you home with him . " " Just let one try . " Sitting down beside her , he lighted his pipe . " Charley do n't mean no harm . He just likes to tell big windies . " " Has he had many squaws ? " " Two or three . " " Did he  --  marry them ? " " Bought ' cm . " She stared at him , not sure whether he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was telling the truth , she exclaimed , " Do you mean to say Indian women are bought and sold like  --  like horses ? " " Sure . A man picks out a squaw he wants , dickers with her pa and settles on a price . Some come higher than others , naturally . You take a young , healthy woman that 's a good cook , she 'll cost a man a sight more than a run-of-the-mill squaw would . " " What if she does n't like the man that buys her ? What if she refuses to live with him ? " " Why , he beats her . That generally makes her behave . " " I think that 's horrible ! " His eyes were twinkling , and now the suspicion came to her that he had n't been telling the truth . She was dying to ask him if he 'd ever owned any squaws , but blessed if she 'd give him a chance to tease her further . Grinning , he held out his hand and helped her up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 're too good a cook to lose . " The Bannocks appeared while they were noon ing next day . Seeing the squaws and children in the band , Dave said their intentions likely were peaceable , for Indians did n't take their families along when they had war in mind . But watching the savages set up their tepees a quarter of a mile down the valley . Mary felt uneasy . Chief Broken Horn , accompanied by half a dozen of the leaders of the tribe , rode into camp presently . Broken Horn made a long speech , emphasized by many dramatic gestures . The gist of it was , Dave said , that Broken Horn considered himself quite a great man . Had he not made forty-nine wagons turn aside from the Oregon trail because the American emigrants feared him ? Was it not only through his generosity and by his consent that this small party was being permitted to cross his lands after paying the toll he demanded ? " Ca n't say as I like that kind of talk , " Jed muttered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It do n't hurt us a bit . " When the chief finished his speech , Dave frowned , then came over to Mary and said , " We 're going to have company for supper , " " Chief Broken Horn ? " " Yeah . He and six of his headmen . You 're to fix them a big feed , he says , with lots of stew and pie like you cooked for him back at Fort Hall . " " I did n't cook anything for him ! He stole that food , and you know it . " " Well , he tells it different . Anyhow he seems to like your cooking and wants more of it . " " Do you mean to tell me I 've got to feed seven of those heathen ? " " Afraid so . He says when he eats well . his dreams are good . He says if his dreams are good tonight , he 'll let us go on in peace . But if his dreams are " Now , look here ! " Jed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bargain and he 's got to stick to it , good dreams or bad ! " " We 've got to humor him , " Dave said , shaking his head . He looked at Mary . " Can you do it ? Can you rustle up enough stew and pie to make them happy ? " Mary was tired and she was scared , but most of all , right now , she was mad . Seemed like all she 'd done since she 'd left home was cater to men , cooking for them , washing for them , mending for them . She had n't minded doing those chores for her own family because that was her job . But if this were a man 's land , why did n't the men out here act like men ? Why had Harlan Faber and the other men back at Fort Hall let an arrogant old Indian turn them aside from their original destination ? Why did n't Charley and Dave make Chief Broken Horn live up to his promise with no nonsense about dreams ? " All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But you 'll all have to help me . " Charley and Mike had killed an antelope and two deer the evening before , so meat was no problem . There was still half a barrel of dried apples left in the SATURDAY EVFNINO POST wagon , plenty of beans , sugar and flour , fifty pounds of potatoes she 'd bought at Fort Hall , and a few carefully hoarded onions , carrots and dried peas . While Charley chopped wood and Dave earned water , she had Mike stretch a large square of canvas on the ground beside one of the wagons  --  on this her guests would sit . Brushing aside her pa 's objections that it was casting pearls before swine , she made him dig out the family 's best china , silverware , glasses , pitcher and a white linen tablecloth , which she laid and set on the canvas ground cloth . Except for the fact that her banquet table had no legs , it looked as attractive as any she 'd ever set back home . How much food could a hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a normal man with a healthy appetite could do away with at one sitting and tripled it , just to be on the safe side . She took special care that there should be more apple pie than her guests could possibly consume . After putting a quantity of dried apples to soak for several hours , she prepared two dozen pie shells . When the apples had soaked sufficiently , she filled the shells , covered them with thin strips of dough , coated them with brown sugar and baked them until they were almost done . One of her most precious culinary treasures was a square tin of grated cheese flakes , which time and the dry western air had long since drawn all moisture from , but which , when sprinkled generously over the top of an apple pie and heated for a few minutes , melted and blended with the sugar to give the pie a delightful flavor . The tin was kept in a wooden chest in the wagon , along with her spices , extracts and family medical supplies . She asked Mike to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rummaged around , then called , " Is it the red tin ? " " No , the blue one . Hurry , Mike ! " He clambered out of the wagon and handed her the tin . Taking a tablespoon , she hurriedly ladled a liberal layer of powdery flakes over the top of each pie , set them back in the Dutch ovens to bake and turned her attention to other tasks . Some minutes later she was exasperated to find Mike , whom she had told to return the tin to the chest , curiously staring down at what remained of its contents . " Mike , will you please quit dawdling and put that away ? " " How come you sprinkled this stuff on the pies ? " " Because it 's cheese , you idiot ! " " Do n't smell like cheese . " He dipped finger and thumb into the tin , took a tiny pinch , sampled it . " Do n't taste like cheese either . " She stared at the tin in horror . It was n't blue . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faded label . She read it and suddenly felt faint . " Oh , my goodness ! " She ran to one of the Dutch ovens , opened it and snatched out a pie . Heedless of scorched lingers , she tried a tiny sample of the browned , delicious-looking crust . Mike did the same . He made a face . " You going to feed these pies to the Indians ? " She closed her eyes and tried to think . The stuff would n't kill them , of that she was sure . It was too late to bake more pies , certainly , for even now the guests were arriving . Dressed in their finest , followed at a respectful distance by a horde of curious squaws , children and uninvited braves , Chief Broken Horn and his subchiefs had dismounted from their horses and were walking into camp . Worn-out and nerve-ragged after her long afternoon of work , Mary felt like dropping to the ground and giving way to February I ' I , 19141 tears . Instead she got mad . She got so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just so long as those pies did n't go to waste . Opening her eyes , she gave her brother a grim look . " I certainly am . Get me the sugar , Mike . Indians will eat anything if it 's tt sweet enough . " Judging from the amount of food consumed and the rapidity with which it vanished , the feast was a huge success . The Indians were vastly fascinated by the plates , dishes and silverware , though they used their bare hands more than they did the knives , forks and spoons . The cold tea , liberally sugared , was a great hit , too , disappearing as fast as Mike could fill the glasses . And the pie brought forth approving grunts from all . Mary had given her own menfolk strict orders not to partake of the pie , telling them that she feared there might not be enough to go round ; but as the Indians t one by one lapsed into glassy-eyed satiety , with half a dozen still uneaten pies before them , Dave gazed longingly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broken Horn . He smiled up at Mary . " Sure does look like fine pie . Ca n't 1 have a piece ? " " No , " Mary said sharply . " Not even a little one ? " he persisted , picking up the pie . " Why , if you knew how long it 's been since I tasted ? " " I said ' no. ? Mary cut in , rudely snatching the pie out of his hand . Pretending that she 'd done it for the sake of her guests , she turned to Chief Broken Horn and smiled . " More pie , Mr. Broken Horn ? " The Indian made a sign indicating he was full up to his chin . As he looked her over from head to toe , a greedy , acquisitive light came into his black eyes . He turned and grunted something to Dave . Dave laughed and winked at Mary . " He says you 're a better cook than his own squaw is . " " That 's very kind of him . " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He says he 'd pay a fancy price . " Mary was too tired to have much of a sense of humor right then . From the way Jed 's race froze , he was n't in a joking mood either . " I wo n't stand for that kind of talk in front of Mary . " " He did n't mean it as an insult , " Dave said . " He meant it as a ? " Chief Broken Hotn showed exactly how he had meant it by reaching up , seizing Mary 's left wrist and pulling her toward him . Livid-faced , Jed leaped to his feet . Dave swore and reached for the pistol in his belt . Charley drew his knife . Mike ran and grabbed up his rifle . But Mary was too angry to wait for help from her menfolk . Quick as a wink , she drew back her right arm and plastered Chief Broken Horn full in the face with the apple pie . For a moment there was n't a sound . The Indians were all staring at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pie out of his eyes , kicking his heels in the air in a most unchieftainlike manner . Getting his feet under him . Chief Broken Horn gave Mary a stunned , hor 95 rifled glance , then wheeled and ran for his horse as if all the hounds of hell were after him . The other Indians wasted no time in following . Mary took a long , deep breath . Turning to look at Jed , she said in a voice filled with shame , " I 'm sorry , pa . " " Do n't be , " Dave said , and his nice gray eyes were hard as flint . " If you had n't done what you did , I 'd have killed him where he sat. - A body does queer things in time of stress . Suddenly becoming aware of the way her ( Continued on Page 97 ) ( Continued from Page 95 ) menfolk were staring at her , their weapons in their hands , their eyes filled with amazement , relief and admiration , she began to laugh . She laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of her she could n't stop . Dave put an arm around her shoulders and said gently . " Easy , Mary  --  easy . " She sighed and quietly fainted . As dark came on and the tires burned ow , they sat huddled together , their backs against a wagon for safety 's sake , listening to the drums in the Indian village . Mary was frightened now , but looking around . seeing the grim looks on the faces of her menfolk as they balasced their rifles across their knees , she was sure of one thing  --  her men would act like men if the need arose , and she was proud of them all . " What do you think they 'll do ? " Jed said . " Hard to tell , " Dave answered . " Broken Horn has lost considerable face , being made a fool of by a woman in pub/. lie . If there 's going to be an attack , it will likely come at dawn . He 'll spend the night stirring up the young bucks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been listening intently to the sounds coming from the village , interrupted , " Quiet , boy ! " " What 's the matter ? " " Them drums . They do n't sound like war drums to me . Sound more like medicine drums . " " What 's the difference ? " Mary asked . Patiently Dave explained that when Bannocks prepared for battle , the drums were pounded in one fashion ; but when there was sickness in the tribe and the medicine man was called in to recite his chants and attempt to heal the ill person , the drums were beaten in another manner . " But Charley 's wrong . " he added . - Chief Broken Horn is n't going to let his medicine man fool around curing sick people tonight . " " Maybe he 's sick . Eating all that food ? " " He 's got the stomach of a wolf . No , they 're war drums , no question about that , " Dave insisted . In the faint glow of the dying fires Mary saw a bulky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called out a chal lenge in the Bannock longue and was quickly answered by an Indian woman . He told her to approach the wagon , and she did so  --  her hesitant pace showing how frightened she was , She was fat , wrinkled and middle-aged . Dave asked her who she was and what she wanted . As she spoke , he translated . " She says she 's Broken Horn 's squaw . " " Is he going to attack ? " Jed said . " She says no . " " So he 's going to stick to his bargain after all ? " " But the young bucks might , she says , if they can work up nerve enough . They 're arguing it out now . " " Ca n't he keep them in line ? " Mary saw Dave frown as the squaw spoke .

" Mary flushed . " Maybe it was the beans and all that cold tea they drank . " " It was the apple pie . was n't it ? You would n't let us eat any of it , but you made sure they stuffed themselves with it . What did you put in that pie , Mary ? " Defiantly Mary looked at Dave . " Epsom salts . " " What ? " " It wo n't hurt them . In fact , they made such pigs of themselves , it might even do them some good . Why , I would n't be surprised but what they all dream real nice dreams  --  when they finally get to steep . That 's what you wanted , was n't it ? " Dave looked shaken . In fact , all her menfolk were staring at her , awe and respect in their eyes . Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Mary . Dave listened for a time , then he silenced her with a gesture . She says either you poisoned her man or cast an evil spell on him because he grabbed hold of you . Whichever it was you did , she 's begging you to make him well . What shall I tell her ? " Mary smiled . " Tell her I cast a spell . " " Now , look beret " " Tell her , please . Tell her that all white women have the power to cast spells over men when they get angry with them . " Reluctantly Dave spoke to the Indian woman . Her black eyes grew wide with fright as she stared at Mary , then she grunted a question . Dave said , " She wants to know how long the spell will last . " " Tell her two days . Tell her if her husband and the other sick chiefs lie quietly for two days and nights , thinking nothing but peaceful thoughts , they will get well . But if they let their people attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread over Dave 's face , " Now why did n't I think of that ? " As he spoke to the squaw , Mary saw the frightened look fade from the woman 's face . The squaw nodded vigorously , turned to go , hesitated ; then shyly walked up to Mary , touched Mary 's breast , then her own , grunted something and ran off into the darkness . Mary looked at Dave . " What did that mean ? " Dave did n't answer for a moment . Then , an uneasy light coming into his nice gray eyes , as if he were looking into the future , he answered , " She says you know how to handle men and she 's glad you hit her husband with that pie . She 's been wanting to sock the old fool for years . " I Saw What Makes Communism Work ( Continued from Page 40 ) well received .

But that happened very rarely  --  the secret police are concentrated in the larger towns . And there was something oddly moving in the repeated discovery that we were so well liked in these Communist countries just because we were Americans  --  a discovery rarely made by Americans traveling abroad in recent years . The reasons Americans are liked in Eastern Europe arc not entirely rational reasons  --  indeed , especially in Hungary , there are wholly rational reasons for disliking Americans . But we Americans are liked all the same , even in Hungary , and essentially because we are not Russians . To put it another way we are , in a symbolic sense , everything the Russians are not , and that is sufficient reason to love us . Almost anywhere in Eastern Europe it is easy enough to sec why the people of the Soviet satellite countries like Americans because they are not Russians . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . British left-wing intellectuals arc fond of complaining that Britain has been transformed into a mere colony of the United States ; that the vulgar and repugnant " American way of life " has been imposed on Britain by economic pressure and force majeure . My game was to imagine that the United States had actually had both the desire and the power to impose its way of life on Britain , in the same way that Russia has imposed its way of life on the countries of Eastern Europe . What would Britain be like then ? In the first place , of course , a British president , a faithful stooge of the American Government , would have replaced both the sovereign and the prime minister . The American ambassador would be accorded pride of place at any gathering , and the British president would consult him before any important move . All American political customs would bedutifully reproduced , right down to whistle-stopping and " spontaneous demonstrations " for presidential candidates , just as such Russian customs as wall newspapers and rhythmic clapping arc reproduced in the satellites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  with , of course , special emphasis on American history , of which even highly educated Britons are smugly ignorant . And American domination of Britain would be publicly advertised in all sorts of other remarkably unsubtle ways . British factories , for example , would be named The George Washington Steel Works or The Warren Gat/label Harding Textile Factory , and they would display such signs as WE GIVE THANKS TO THE GREAT UNITED STATES FOR THIS FACTORY . Along the roadside would be other signs : LONG LIVE THE GREAT AMERICAN REPUBLICAN PARTY , Or OUR FRIENDSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES IS AS NECESSARY TO US AS THE AIR WE BREATHE . As 1 say , the thought gave me a certain wry amusement  --  the more so because the British intellectuals who complain of Americanization are the very same pen-plc who are always ready to justify the total Soviet domination of half of Europe as motivated wholly by quite reasonable considerations of self-defense . Even so , the analogy seems to me to have a certain real political meaning . For suppose it were true . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no doubt , be some Britons ready to make the best of the situation , or even to profit by it . But the vast majority would detest all Americans and all America 's stooges . And however powerful , ruthless and determined we Americans might be , and however feeble and necessitous the British , in one way or another in the long reach of history  --  by blood and terror or by the slow erosion of time  --  the attempt to remake Britain totally in the American image would fail . That suggests one of the conclusions which I carried away with me after seven weeks in the Soviet Union 's European empire . it is not so much a conclusion , really , as an instinct , a presumptuous attempt to smell the shape of unwritten history . In the long run  --  perhaps the very long run  --  the Soviet attempt to impose a
